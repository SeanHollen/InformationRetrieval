   A former Russian language specialist for the Air
Force 34-year-old was arrested Friday on espionage charges, accused
of trying to give U.S. military secrets to the Soviet Union.
   Ronald Craig Wolf, 34, was arrested without incident by the FBI
on a warrant charging him with gathering or delivering defense
information to aid a foreign government, authorities said.
   He was being held at Lew Sterrett Justice Center and was to
appear before a U.S. Magistrate, officials said. If convicted, Wolf
could face life imprisonment.
   The FBI said Wolf, formerly a Russian specialist for the Air
Force, never actually made contact with anyone from the Soviet
Union, but believed he was doing so when he handed over classified
materials to an undercover agent.
   Wolf, who worked occasionally as an automobile salesman, was
unemployed and living in a Dallas rooming house at the time of his
arrest, the FBI said.
   As a specialist who monitored and transcribed sensitive
communications, Wolf had been granted a ``Top Secret'' clearance
that gave him access to classified Air Force documents ``and
programs vital to the defense of the United States,'' according to
an affidavit by FBI special agent James W. Evans.
   Wolf was discharged from the Air Force in 1981, upon a
recommendation from superiors that he was financially irresponsible.
   In March, Wolf contacted someone he believed was a Soviet
undercover agent, but was actually an undercover FBI agent,
officials said. Over the course of five conversations, Wolf
allegedly discussed his military background and made it clear that
he would sell military secrets and also wanted to defect.
   According to the FBI, his motivation was not only money, but
also ``to get revenge for his treatment by the United States
government.''
   He later sent two letters containing material to a post office
box in Maryland, the FBI said. The material was later determined by
Air Force investigators to be sensitive information about Air Force
operations and programs.

   A crowd of about 1,000 opponents
of Indian spearfishing treaty rights gathered Friday night and more
than 100 were arrested after protesters surged across a police line.
   Police used vans and a school bus to haul those arrest away from
a boat landing at Trout Lake just hours after a federal judge
refused to order the Chippewa Indians to stop their spearfishing.
   A crowd, mainly protesters but including some treaty-rights
supporters, gathered on the eve of the state's general
hook-and-line sports fishing season opener.
   At about 8:15 p.m., a group of protesters, many of them waving
American flags and some shouting ``Equal Rights'' crossed the
police line.
   The spearfishing supporters, who were not involved in the
activities that led to the arrests, appeared at the boat landing to
show support for the Chippewa, who exercising fishing rights
retained in 19th century treaties in which the tribe gave up its
title to the northern part of Wisconsin.
   The protest came after U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb refused
Friday to grant a state request for an order to halt the spearing
before sport anglers open their season Saturday.
   State officials made the request because of concerns about the
ability of police to maintain public safety because of the tensions
over the traditional Chippewa fishing.
   Tribal members have faced crowds of hundreds of protesters, some
shouting racial slurs and throwing rocks, during the spearing
season that began April 23. There had been more than 100 arrests
before Friday's.
   This is the fifth year Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands have
speared walleye from northern Wisconsin lakes since a federal court
ruled the tribe retained the rights to hunt, fish and gather wild
grain under 19th century treaties that ceded land to the United
States.
   Tensions over the spring spearfishing have increased each year.
They have heightened this year after the state reduced the
sportfishing walleye catch limit on the 254 lakes the tribe has
targeted for possible spearing.

<TEXT>
   The foreman of the Oliver North jury says the
jurors were caught in ``a war between the Democrats and the
Republicans'' and should have received the testimony of President
Bush and former President Reagan.
   Nevertheless, ``I think it was a fair trial,'' Denise Anderson,
34, told reporters at a news conference in her living room Friday,
24 hours after the jury convicted North of three Iran-Contra
charges and acquitted him of nine others.
   Asked whether the trial was fair even though Reagan was not
called to testify about the events that shook his second White
House term, Ms. Anderson said, ``It was fair to a certain degree.''
   ``I feel as though Reagan, and I could go on to elaborate on who
else, should have been down there,'' she said.
   She did not elaborate on who else, but when asked if she
included Bush, she replied, ``I'm not leaving him out.''
   Asked if she would like to have heard Reagan's testimony, Ms.
Anderson said: ``Yes, because he knew a lot about what was going
on.''
   Both Bush and Reagan have said they told investigators all they
knew about the Iran-Contra scandal, which occurred while Reagan was
president and Bush vice president.
   The defense subpoenaed both of them to testify, but Judge
Gerhardt Gesell quashed the subpoena. He cited court precedents
against requiring the testimony of a sitting president, and said
the defense had not shown that Reagan's testimony was needed.
   Documents in the trial suggested a bigger role for Bush than
revealed earlier concerning the solicitation of other countries'
support for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua at a time when U.S.
military aid for them was banned by law. But Bush, who visited
Honduras' president in early 1985, declared Thursday the meeting
had not been part of any deal to provide Honduras with expedited
U.S. aid in return for help for the rebels.
   Asked whether the trial was worth the money it cost, the jury
foreman said: ``I think in a way it was a waste of taxpayers'
money. I think it was a war going on, right here in our Congress. I
see it as a war between the Democrats and the Republicans.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater turned away
questions about a pardon for North, saying he asked Bush about it
and the president replied, ``I haven't discussed it with anybody.''
   Fitzwater said Bush preferred ``not to have any comment at this
time'' on the verdicts.
   North said Thursday he would appeal.
   Earl F. Williams, 65, an unemployed former security guard who
served on the jury, expressed sympathy for North, an ex-Marine who
served as a National Security Council aide in the Reagan White
House.
   ``I think in my heart that he thought he was doing the right
thing,'' Williams said. ``And I think there were people higher who
gave him authority to do a lot of things and then, when he got
caught out there high and dry, no one came to help him.''
   Ms. Anderson, a clerical worker at a hospital, said none of the
jurors favored convicting North on all counts ``because they (the
prosecution) didn't have the proof and the facts to back it up.''
But she said she believed North ``should do some time'' in prison
for the counts he was convicted of.
   North faces a maximum of 10 years plus a fine of up to $750,000.
Gesell said he would pass sentence on June 23.
   Asked if she was impressed with the testimony of North's
secretary, Fawn Hall, who broke down in tears as she defended her
former boss, Ms. Anderson said, ``No, at all.''
   ``All that crying she did down there ... She's just trying to
get a piece of the action,'' the jury foreman said.
   _Juror Tara King, 35, said in interviews that she had been using
cocaine until ``three or four months'' before the trial, but she
said it did not affect her work as a juror. King said she did not
tell the trial judge about her previous use of drugs because ``he
didn't ask me.''

   Jamalat Abu Luli shyly pulled
aside the collar of her tunic to show the mark from her latest
encounter with the Israeli army.
   At age 14, she has been shot three times with rubber-coated
pellets fired by soldiers.
   When there is trouble on the streets of the Rafah Palestinian
refugee camp _ someone being arrested or beaten by soldiers _
Jamalat joins the crowd that almost inevitably forms to protest.
   ``This is what I have to do. It is my duty,'' she said Friday,
sitting with her mother, brothers and sisters in their house of
four tiny rooms in the camp's Shabura quarter.
   Her latest injury, a week earlier, left a mark on her skin over
the right clavicle. The doctor at the U.N. Relief and Works Agency
clinic closed the wound left by the rubber-coated metal pellet with
two stitches.
   ``I went to the UNRWA clinic like I always do,'' she said. ``I
had an X-ray, but nothing was wrong with the bone.''
   The clash began when soldiers tried to force a teen-age boy to
climb up a utility poll to remove an outlawed Palestinian flag,
Jamalat said.
   ``They dragged him out of his house. They started to beat him.
Of course, people came out to help,'' she said, adding that 12
others were hit by the pellets that soldiers fired after tear gas
failed to chase off the crowd.
   In the room where Jamalat was interviewed, there was a picture
of her 24-year-old brother, Farid, who is serving the third year of
a four-year sentence on charges he was a member of the outlawed
Fatah, Yasser Arafat's faction of the PLO.
   There also was a picture of American singer Michael Jackson and
a framed saying from Islam's holy Koran: ``God is kindly with his
people.''
   Jamalat said her best subjects in school are science and math,
and she hopes to be a nurse or doctor. But if she gets her dream,
she added, ``I'd like to be a soldier in the Palestine army.''
   She smiled when asked if she would go out again to take part in
the next protest. ``Of course,'' she said, ``I am not afraid.''
   Jamalat said she was hit the first time in December, in the
right arm, when soldiers tried to break up a protest at her junior
high school. Three months later, two of the pellets struck her
right thigh as women tried to block an arrest near her home.
   She saved one of the rubber bullets from the second clash. It is
a metal ball about the size of a marble, covered by hard rubber.
   Jamalat has never been seriously injured and was never counted
among the army's list of wounded. Only those hospitalized with
wounds from plastic bullets or lead rounds are on that list.
   Her latest wound came near her house, off a dirt street
alongside the rusted, twisted track of the railway that used to run
from Cairo to Beirut before it was destroyed in the 1948
Arab-Israeli war.
   Rafah is on the Egyptian border, and the Gaza Strip was
controlled by Egypt from 1948 until the strip was captured by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Jamalat's house is up a lane about two feet wide that runs
between the walls of the cement block and stucco houses. She lives
there with her mother and father, grandmother, six brothers and
three sisters.
   Her father and mother were born in Beersheba but fled when the
town became part of Israel. Her father travels to work as a farm
laborer in Israel, while Jamalat stays home to protest.
   And what does she want from the protests?
   ``To be free,'' she said. ``To have our own government, our own
flag, our own money.''

<HEAD>Latest Nuclear Controversy Renews Talk of Abolishing NRC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's muted
response to revelations of ``silence-for-money'' deals between
nuclear plant builders and workers is fueling a drive on Capitol
Hill to replace the commission with a new agency.
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., plans to introduce a bill next week
that would dissolve the NRC and create a Nuclear Safety Agency,
Breaux aide Bob Mann said Friday.
   Unlike the five-member commission, the new agency would be
headed by a single administrator. It also would have an independent
board to investigate reactor safety problems.
   ``It's a long overdue change,'' said John Ahearne, an NRC member
for five years and its chairman from 1979-81.
   A similar bill in the last Congress easily passed the Senate but
died in the House.
   At a hearing Thursday on the silence-for-money issue, Breaux
said the commission's inability to agree on the legality and
acceptability of such deals was clear evidence that it should be
abolished in the best interests of the industry.
   ``The commission ... fails to send coherent and timely
regulatory signals to the nuclear industry and the public,'' Breaux
said. ``This must be changed.''
   Breaux slammed the commission for not publicly disavowing an
agreement signed by Brown &amp; Root, the builder of the Comanche Peak
nuclear plant in Texas, and a former electrician who claims he was
dismissed for questioning plant safety. The worker was paid
$15,000, plus $20,000 for his attorneys, in exchange for agreeing
to drop his complaints and not testify at NRC licensing hearings.
   Breaux said his subcommittee had evidence at least one other
such agreement existed between a builder and a worker. He said even
if these deals were legal, they hurt the nuclear industry by giving
at least the appearance of ``bribery.''
   Lando W. Zech Jr., the NRC chairman, said commission members
disagreed on the legality of such arrangements, and the commission
intended to study the matter further.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said it already was clear the NRC had
outlived its usefulness.
   ``It doesn't work, it never has, and we had better jettison it
...,'' Simpson said.
   The main beefs against the commission are that it is slow to act
and that its members are too cozy with the utilities whose plants
must be licensed by the NRC.
   When the NRC was created in 1974 as part of legislation that
abolished the Atomic Energy Commission, the purpose was to separate
the regulators from those in government who were promoting the
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Critics in recent years have said
the NRC is too vulnerable to promotional influences.
   A 1984 report by the non-profit Union of Concerned Scientists,
assessing the NRC's first decade, said its lack of skepticism about
the nuclear industry had ``blinded the agency to fundamental safety
defects'' that hurt the industry and consumers.
   Plans to replace the NRC with an agency headed by a single
administrator _ along the lines of the Environmental Protection
Agency _ have been proposed, but died, many times in the past. The
nuclear utility companies have opposed the legislation.
   Mann said Breaux's bill, co-sponsored by Simpson, will include
these main provisions:
   _Abolish the commission and establish the Nuclear Safety Agency,
headed by an administrator appointed by the president and subject
to confirmation by the Senate.
   _Create an office of inspector general, headed by a presidential
appointee, to investigate allegations of wrongdoing within the
agency. A separate office of investigations would probe possible
wrongdoing at nuclear plants.
   _Create a safety investigations board to conduct independent
investigations of significant safety problems at licensed nuclear
facilities.

<HEAD>Soviet Sales Made Under New Subsidized Grain Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five companies have sold wheat to the Soviet
Union under the new subsidized grain deal announced by President
Bush.
   In all, the Agriculture Department is expected to approve
subsidies on 1.5 million metric tons of wheat destined to the
Soviet Union. The first 300,000 tons were announced on Friday.
   Christopher E. Goldthwait, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said the sales by five
exporting companies call for shipment later this month.
   Goldthwait said the subsidies averaged $8.46 per ton, or about
23 cents per bushel of wheat. The total for the 300,000 tons would
be about $2.5 million.
   The Soviet Union had bought more than 4 million tons of U.S.
wheat for 1988-89 delivery at prices subsidized under the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, but the previous
authorization had virtually run out with the last sale March 13.
   Bush, under pressure from USDA and farm-state members of
Congress, announced a new authorization on May 2 of 1.5 million
tons, half of what had been sought. However, according to wheat
people and others, the Soviets agreed to buy an additional 1.5
million tons of wheat later in the summer at regular market prices.
   Members of Congress want the Bush administration, including the
Office of Management and Budget, to clarify the role of the subsidy
program and to explain why there has been a slowdown in new
authorizations.
   In addition to the wheat, USDA said the Soviet Union bought an
additional 200,000 tons of corn for delivery during the current
marketing year, which runs through Sept. 30.
   The latest sales brought to a record 19.1 million tons the total
corn and wheat sales to the Soviet Union for delivery this year
under terms of the long-term supply agreement between the two
countries. The old mark of 18.6 million tons shipped to the Soviets
was reached in 1984-85.
   Corn, which is not subsidized, makes up almost 15 million tons
of the current total, with wheat at 4.13 million tons. In addition,
the Soviets have bought 450,000 tons of soybeans, 1.37 million tons
of soybean meal, and 757,400 tons of grain sorghum.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 300,000 tons of
wheat would be about 11 million bushels, and the 200,000 tons of
corn about 7.9 million bushels.
   Wheat prices have been averaging about $4.15 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $46 million.
   The corn sale, at around $2.56 per bushel, would have a current
farm value of $20 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Goldthwait said the new subsidized wheat sales were handled by
Ferruzzi USA Inc., 50,000 tons; Central States Enterprises Inc.,
50,000; Peavey Co., 120,000; Union Equity Exchange, 50,000; and
Richco Grain Ltd., 30,000.
   The identities of firms selling corn or other commodities not
awarded USDA subsidies are not disclosed.

   Oliver North will keep his Marine Corps
pension, at least until he's sentenced on June 23.
   The corps, in a brief statement, said Friday it wanted to
correct reports that North's pension already had been stopped.
   North, a retired lieutenant colonel and former Natioal Security
Council aide, was convicted Thursday of three felony counts
stemming from the Iran-Contra affair.
   On Thursday, the Marine Corps said one of those three felonies _
destroying NSC documents _ was sufficient to cost him his military
pension of roughly $23,100 a year.
   On Friday, however, the corps said North's conviction would have
to be reviewed by military lawyers and his sentencing completed
before any other steps were taken.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
propose to the Soviet Union next week in Moscow that the
superpowers reopen negotiations in June to sharply reduce strategic
nuclear weapons, U.S. officials said.
   Baker will suggest the Geneva talks basically pick up where they
left off in November, when they were recessed with about 90 percent
of the work completed on a treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet
arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   But Baker does not intend to outline to the Soviets the position
the United States will take on specific issues at the bargaining
table, said the officials, who spoke Friday on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Essentially, we are looking for continuity and keeping arms
control on a fast track,'' an official said.
   The negotiations had been tentatively scheduled to resume in
mid-February. But President Bush, after taking office in January,
ordered an indefinite postponement while the administration
reviewed U.S. arms control and weapons policies.
   The proposal to resume talks the third week in June and a
decision to try to maintain the momentum that produced agreement on
some weapons ceilings resulted from the review.
   The negotiators have some tough problems to grapple with,
though. Among the unsettled issues are whether to try to restrict
mobile missiles and how to verify such elusive weapons as cruise
missiles fired from airplanes and submarines.
   Meanwhile, a senior aide to Baker said the administration had
ruled out any deal with the Soviets to impose a coalition
government in Afghanistan.
   The official, briefing reporters on the May 10-11 talks, said
the United States had neither the inclination nor the power to
persuade the Afghan rebels to strike a deal with President
Najibullah.
   Calling for the Soviet-backed leader's ouster, the official
said, ``We do not believe we will have peace in Afghanistan'' as
long as Najibullah is in power.''

<HEAD>EPA, Automakers Discuss Possible Methanol Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has met with the Big
Three automakers to discuss legislation that would help bring about
commercial production of vehicles that burn methanol and other
gasoline substitutes.
   The head of the Environmental Protection Agency's clean air
programs, William G. Rosenberg, discussed possible legislation in
late April with the Big Three automakers.
   ``We're giving it serious consideration,'' EPA spokesman David
Cohen said Friday. He said the administration considers the
technology ``new and exciting.''
   The proposals, if adopted, would be included in President Bush's
draft of broad revisions to the Clean Air Act, Cohen said.
   Cohen said that Rosenberg, in meetings with the automakers,
outlined the benefits of methanol to the environment. The
alcohol-based fuel has been presented as a means of cutting
emissions of gases that cause smog as well as a way of reducing
U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
   ``Inevitably, the point was made that if alternative fuels prove
to be as effective in terms of their environmental benefits as we
think they may be, it will relieve a bit of the pressure to explore
other control options,'' Cohen said.
   The discussions were general and focused only on environmental
benefits of alternative fuels, Cohen said.
   ``There has never been any talk about specific emissions
equipment or reductions,'' Cohen said. ``There has never been any
talk of a time frame.''
   Rosenberg discussed alternate fuels with executives of General
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and the Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Association, a trade group representing the U.S.
makers, Cohen said.
   GM, through spokesman John Anderson, said the discussions were
routine, part of the normal process of helping policymakers make
informed decisions.
   ``We're not negotiating,'' Anderson said. ``We're exchanging
information.''
   There was no immediate comment Friday from Ford and Chrysler.
   The auto industry has been working on alternative fuels
technology for years, but prospects for commercial production have
been clouded by the lack of a national distribution system for
methanol and concerns about poor performance and other barriers to
customer acceptance.
   The three major U.S. automakers have produced prototypes of cars
that can run on a mixture composed mainly of methanol, and some of
the vehicles are capable of switching from methanol to pure
gasoline.

<HEAD>Pentagon Won't Give Reprieve to Osprey Builders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department is standing firm in its
decision to cancel the V-22 Osprey weapon program, and is warning
the two companies working on the project to honor their current
contract.
   The two companies, in turn, said Friday they had decided against
laying off employees and promised they would keep working with
sympathetic members of Congress to win more money for the
tilt-rotor aircraft.
   The current contract with Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. and the
Boeing Helicopter Co. expires Sept. 30, the end of fiscal year 1989.
   ``We expect them to honor their commitments,'' said Lt. Cmdr.
Jim Kudla, a Pentagon spokesman. ``Our position on this program has
not changed.''
   The two companies had warned the Pentagon they considered Friday
the deadline for receiving a commitment of additional federal
dollars.
   But a Bell spokesman, Terry Arnold, announced late in the day
the two companies had suspended their threat of layoffs for the
moment.
   ``Pleased with strong bipartisan congressional support for the
V-22 program, Bell-Boeing officials said today they're continuing
to meet with senior Defense Department management, seeking their
support for the Osprey tilt-rotor program,'' Arnold said.
   ``Bell-Boeing has reached no decision on a future course of
action at this time. We are continuing to work on the program.''
   Another company official, who asked not to be named, told The
Associated Press the contractors were still hopeful of getting more
money from the Pentagon.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in fashioning a fiscal 1990
military budget to honor a White House-Congress budget compromise,
last week announced $10 billion in cuts to the original spending
plan of the Reagan administration.
   In making those cuts, Cheney ordered the Osprey program canceled
outright, saying the Pentagon simply couldn't afford the plane and
that the Marine Corps could do just as well by ordering additional
_ and cheaper _ helicopters.
   The Pentagon had planned to spend $25.9 billion on 663 Ospreys,
including $1.3 billion in 1990. The department has already invested
$2 billion in the program over a nine-year period.
   One senior defense official, who likewise insisted on anonymity,
declared: ``The decision has been made that there's not going to be
any more money.''
   The V-22 Osprey, described by the Marine Corps as its most
important weapon program, is a revolutionary aircraft designed to
take off like a helicopter and fly like an airplane. To do this, it
utilizes special propellers at the tip of each wing that can swivel
upward and back.
   The Marine Corps wants to use the planes to improve its ability
to conduct surprise, long-range amphibious assaults. The first of
the planes just recently began flight tests in Texas.
   The problem facing Bell-Boeing is that the contractors already
have received all the Pentagon money due them under their fiscal
1989 development contract and are experiencing overruns. Thus in
order to continue work on a program that Cheney has vowed to kill
on Oct. 1, the companies would have to sink their own money into
the project for the next five months.
   The Pentagon has estimated the overruns at roughly $25 million a
month.

<TEXT>
   Charges of fraud and U.S. meddling
have replaced Panama's social and economic problems as the main
issues in Sunday's presidential election.
   A three-party coalition hoping to unseat the government and its
de facto leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, claims a substantial
lead in polls but charges the government plans to steal the
election.
   The strongly anti-American government has trumpeted reports that
the CIA funneled $10 million to the opposition campaign. Washington
declines to comment on the reports, which the opposition denies.
   Noriega is not a candidate, but the election is seen as a
referendum on his rule since he assumed control of Panama's defense
forces in 1985.
   Voters cast ballots Sunday for a president, two vice presidents,
67 legislators and hundreds of local officers.
   A recent poll by the Civil Opposition Alliance gave its own
presidential candidate, Guillermo Endara, a lead of 58 percent to
26 percent for government-backed Carlos Duque.
   ``The information we have is that the government polls show them
to be worse off than ours do,'' said Willy Cochez, vice president
of the alliance's Christian Democratic Party.
   The government has not published its polls.
   Cochez said alliance supporters have discovered attempts to rig
the election.
   ``We have detected about 60,000 cedulas (voter identification
cards) with the same numbers but different names on them,'' Cochez
said in an interview. Between 150,000 and 200,000 cards were
duplicated, meaning hundreds of thousands of the 1.1 million
registered voters can vote more than once, he claimed.
   Cochez also said pro-government activists are visiting houses
that display opposition symbols and offering to buy voters' cards.
   ``There may be five people who can vote in the house and they
are offered $50 each. If the family is poor it might not ever see
that much money at one time again. What is this person to do?''
Cochez asked.
   Government officials frequently told opposition voters seeking
cards that the camera for identification photographs was broken or
that there was no film, said Cochez. ``All lies,'' he added.
   The U.S. government also predicts fraud. American officials are
discussing not who will win but what they should do in the face of
the expected vote manipulation.
   ``The polls are so bad that (Noriega) will have to steal it big
time,'' said Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo.
   Noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in Miami last
year on drug-trafficking charges, charges he denies. Then-President
Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire him, but was ousted himself by
Noriega.
   The United States has frozen $140 million in Panamanian bank
deposits and canal payments, hobbling the banking industry and
leaving the government ill-equipped to meet payrolls or fund basic
social programs.
   Such sanctions hit hard in a country where one in every eight
workers has a government job, and the government relies heavily on
the poor and the public sector for support.
   Government officials say the election will be clean and legal
but acknowledged Sunday that was not always the case.
   ``We must not repeat ... the phenomenon of the elections of
1984, in which the National Tabulation Board, in a sad omissconsequences
could be described as deadly to the image of the
Electoral Tribunal,'' tribunal president Yolanda Pulice de
Rodriguez said Sunday.
   He was referring to the ``victory'' of Nicolas Ardito Barletta
in 1984 after the government stopped the vote count.
   Pro-government newspapers have played heavily on reports of the
alleged $10 million CIA donation to the opposition, which has
access to some radio stations, but whose press Noriega closed more
than a year ago.
   ``The $10 million is only the part that we know about,'' acting
President Manuel Solis Palma told a cheering crowd in the Atlantic
coastal city of Colon last week. ``We have information that it
could be more.''
   Guillermo Ford, one of two opposition vice presidential
candidates, retorted: ``We don't need money from anybody to run our
campaign.''
   The reports gave some credence to government charges that the
United States wants to reduce Panama to a colony, invade militarily
and renege on the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, which give Panama
control of the canal in 2000.
   For the government, the charges could not have come at a better
time, enlivening a dull campaign. But many Panamanians say the
election will not solve their country's problems. Noriega has
survived everything the opposition and the United States have been
able to throw at him.
   ``It doesn't matter who wins, the future will remain
uncertain,'' said Carmen Black, a 26-year-old housewife.
   ``People are afraid, and a lot of people aren't going to vote,''
said 40-year-old publicist Sara Villamonte.

<HEAD>Bush Standing by Ambassador Nominees Despite Iran-Contra Questions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush stands behind his appointments
of Donald Gregg and John Negroponte to key ambassadorships despite
questions in Congress over their roles in the Iran-Contra affair,
the White House says.
   ``The president feels both of those nominations are very
important to carrying out the policies of the government in the
areas in which he has asked them to serve,'' White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Friday. ``He is very proud of both
appointments and thinks they are outstanding men who should be
confirmed.''
   Gregg, Bush's national security adviser when Bush was vice
president, has been nominated as ambassador to South Korea.
Negroponte, Honduran ambassador when Bush was vice president, has
been tapped as the Bush administration's emissary to Mexico.
   Fitzwater said trial documents which have caused some lawmakers
to express reservations about Negroponte and Gregg would not cause
Bush to back away from the nominations,
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Asia subcommittee, is said to have asked Secretary of
State James A. Baker III to reconsider Gregg's nomination because
documents raised doubts about Gregg's past assertions that he did
nothing illegal or improper in his contacts with North and other
Iran-contra figures.
   Gregg's relationship with Felix Rodriguez, a key figure in
North's private aid network to help the Contras during the
congressional ban on aid, was a controversial topic throughout the
Iran-Contra investigations. Gregg has repeatedly bolstered Bush's
assertion that as vice president he did not know the extent of
North's clandestine efforts.
   Gregg's confirmation hearing is scheduled for next week.
   The Foreign Relations Committee delayed a vote on Negroponte's
nomination last month after some Democratic senators requested more
time to review whether as ambassador to Honduras he was involved in
a quid pro quo arrangement to entice Honduras to help the rebels.
   John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff, has cited a cable from
Negroponte as proof that Bush did not engage in a discussion of
such arrangements for the Contras when he met with Honduran
President Roberto Suazo in early 1985.
   Fitzwater said the appropriate congressional committees would be
briefed on confidential cables that described Bush's activities in
that regard.
   Bush on Thursday denied being involved in any quid pro quo
arrangement nd denied knowing of any such effort by others in the
administration.
   Documents from the North trial had Bush and Suazo meeting at a
time when internal Reagan administration memos suggested a plan in
which continuing U.S. aid to Latin American countries would be
linked to assistance for the rebels.
   The document never asserted that Bush discussed a quid pro quo
arrangement with Suazo. But it said he explained to the Hondurans
that they were to receive a great deal more U.S. economic and other
aid _ aid the document said was part of a deal approved by
then-President Reagan.

<HEAD>Group Says Cut in Farm Subsidies Would Help Rich Countries, Hurt

<TEXT>
   Third World countries stand to suffer
regardless of whether farm subsidies are eliminated, says an
international research group.
   ``We in the North subsidize prosperous areas, and send the
subsidized food to the South at prices so low their farmers cannot
compete,'' said Robert A. Pry, the American director of the
International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis.
   On the other hand, the higher prices that consumers pay when
subsidies are eliminated can lead to hunger, the group said.
   Pry was briefing staff members from Congress and others on
Friday.
   He said trade negotiators in Geneva should consider whether
compensation should be given to countries that will suffer
economically as a result of lower subsidies.
   He also said Third World countries not taking part in the
negotiations ought to attend the trade talks in their own interest.
   Wouter Tims, a member of the institute's council, said that the
United States would benefit from lower domestic prices for food and
more sales abroad if subsidies were reduced.
   ``Exports of (U.S.) wheat and coarse grains (would) dominate the
market, with a share of 90 percent by the year 2000,'' he was
quoted as saying in the institute's monthly ``Options.''
   ``The outcomes for developing countries such as Kenya, Nigeria,
Argentina and Thailand are positive, but for others, such as
Brazil, Mexico, Egypt and possibly Indonesia and India, there are
significant net losses,'' he added.
   Pry said experts from his headquarters at Laxenburg, Austria,
will go later this month to Geneva, where representatives of nearly
100 countries are working on trade agreements they hope to complete
by the end of 1990. On Thursday the Senate Finance Committee
recommended confirmation of Rufus H. Yerxa as the chief American
negotiator.
   Major governments have agreed to reduce farm subsidies
substantially, but not to eliminate them entirely by the year 2000
as the United States has asked.
   The institute has published two volumes of a massive
three-volume study called ``Toward Free Trade in Agriculture.''
Harvey Brooks, chairman of the U.S. Committee for the Institute,
said it cost $4 million just to get agreement on the basic figures
used.
   The third volume, to be published later this year, will deal
with hunger.
   ``The average per capita calorie intake in the developing
countries decreases under agricultural trade liberalization by
(western industrial) countries, and consequently the incidence of
hunger increases,'' the report said.
   ``Trade liberalization'' means reduction of subsidies.
   So far there has been little public discussion on these
subsidies.
   ``National governments are spending over $120 billion per year
subsidizing surplus production and the cost of its disposal,'' the
study said.
   ``Some developing countries benefit from the subsidized disposal
of surplus cereals on the world market. This, however, is only a
short term gain.
   ``Low prices are a disincentive to their own producers and lead,
in the long run, to an unsustainable dependence on imports, as is
the case in many parts of Africa.''
   The group has 16 member countries, including the United States
and the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>North Trial Document Released, Covers Iran Arms Sales</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-North Trial Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newly released document from the trial of
Oliver North shows high U.S. officials had intelligence reports in
1986 spelling out the inflated prices North and Richard Secord were
charging for arms sold to Iran.
   The three-page stipulation of evidence was unsealed Friday in
censored form as a result of a lawsuit filed by 10 news
organizations and settled by agreement with the Justice Department.
   The document, which had been released to the jury, said
intelligence gathered in a 15-month period beginning in September
1985 ``provides information regarding the pricing and delivery of
missiles and military material sold to Iran and the release of
American hostages held in Lebanon.''
   North's lawyers used the document in their closing argument in
an effort to show that then-CIA Director William Casey and
then-national security adviser John Poindexter knew that Hawk
missiles were aboard a November 1985 shipment sent from Israel to
Iran with assistance by the CIA.
   North was found guilty of three felony charges Thursday,
including the preparation of a false chronology for Congress
stating that no one in the government knew until January 1986 that
missiles were in the November 1985 shipment. North's defense on the
charge was that Casey and Poindexter knew at the time what was
aboard, but participated in covering up that fact.
   The document spelled out that the 17 recipients of the
intelligence reports ``exclusively'' were Poindexter and his
predecessor in the job, Robert McFarlane, North, Casey, Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger and other senior intelligence officials.
   ``The reports contained information about pricing of this
material, and those recipients of the reports at the CIA, National
Security Council and the Department of Defense who knew the actual
cost of this material to the DoD could have known the Iranians were
being significantly overcharged,'' the paper said.
   ``The reports of very late November and early December 1985
revealed that Hawk missiles were shipped to Iran from Israel in
connection with recovery efforts.''
   Still-classified reports on the intelligence were gathered by
``various methods of surveillance'' and ``show individuals
involved, including General Secord,'' the document adds. North
enlisted Secord to run arms to the Contras and also had the former
Air Force major general-turned-businessman assist arms shipments to
Iran for the Reagan administration.
   North and Secord diverted profits from the Iran arms sales into
bank accounts controlled by Secord and some of the diverted money
was funneled to the Contras. The diversion originally formed the
heart of the criminal indictment against North, but the U.S.
intelligence community refused to declassify key documents
addressing those charges and they were dropped.

<TEXT>
   Despite assurances by Exxon executives,
the oil company has not been paying tourism-related losses
attributed to the nation's worst oil spill, state officials and
business operators say.
   Ron Clarke, a special assistant to Gov. Steve Cowper, said there
are wide disparities between what top Exxon officials are saying
publicly and what is happening to the claims of tourism operators.
   ``Depending on who you talk to, you get different answers,''
Clarke said Thursday.
   Bill Tribble, manager of Exxon's Valdez claims office, said the
company gives priority to ``on-the-water'' claims, and that claims
covering tourism losses on shore will be handled later.
   Tourism is a billion-dollar-a-year industry in Alaska. Many
segments already are taking a beating from the spill, which fouled
hundreds of miles of beaches along Prince William Sound and the
southern Alaska coast.
   Sport fishing guides, tour boat and bus tour operators are
reporting a run of cancellations, and a sharp decrease in the
number of bookings they normally would be taking this time of year.
   Exxon agreed this week to finance a $4 million media blitz aimed
at key markets across the country that contribute about one-third
of the state's visitors each year.
   But that general assistance apparently isn't being translated to
individual situations.
   Glenn Williams, who runs bus tours out of Eagle River to Homer,
Seward and Prince William Sound, said he submitted two claims,
totaling more than $30,000, for tours canceled as a direct result
of the spill.
   He said his claims were rejected by Exxon, and he was told by a
claims adjuster that ``nobody in tourist-related businesses falls
under the (reimbursement) guidelines at this time.''
   ``I know there's a lot of people losing a lot of bookings,''
Williams said. ``Our phones just stopped ringing about three weeks
ago.''
   Exxon spokesman Tribble insisted no such claims have been
denied, but acknowledged they haven't been paid either. He said the
company's emphasis at this point is to take care of commercial
fishermen and tour boat operators.
   ``We haven't addressed any type of off-water claims yet,'' said
Tribble. ``I'm not saying we're not going to.''
   ``Tourism in Alaska is much bigger than me or you or this man
with his 21-day tour,'' Tribble said. ``I don't have the authority
to make that decision.''
   Asked who did have the authority, Tribble replied: ``I don't
know.''
   Clarke said he couldn't see any difference between a commercial
fisherman's claim and one from a bus tour operator like Williams or
a sport fishing guide who lost clients because of the spill.
   Clarke said the problem has been particularly severe in Cordova,
a community almost entirely dependent on commercial fishing.
   He said Exxon had announced earlier Thursday that it would pay
claims only to fishermen and processors, and not to ``Main Street
businesses'' like restaurants, grocery stores and hardware stores,
even though they are totally dependent on fishermen.
   ``After considerable haranguing from a lot of quarters,'' Exxon
reversed itself, and said it would pay claims for those businesses
in Cordova, Clarke said.
   He said the state has a written agreement with Exxon promising
to pay the secondary claims in Cordova.
   Clarke said the governor's office will continue to try to make
claims officers follow the policies enunciated publicly by Exxon
executives.
   ``When it gets right down to filing claims, it is something very
different,'' Clarke said of Exxon's actions. ``There's a little
fancy footwork going on.''
   Clarke said the spill chill has stretched as far south as
Ketchikan where sport fishing guides have reported cancellations,
even though the oil is 700 miles to the northwest.
   ``The lack of knowledge of Alaska geography is working against
us,'' Clarke said.

   Actor Gordon Jump once portrayed a radio
station manager with little or nothing to do. Today, as Maytag's
new ``Ol' Lonely'' repairman, Jump's role won't change much.
   But he did have something to do Friday as Maytag Co. officials
marked a milestone at Plant No. 2 in Newton, which celebrated its
40th anniversary.
   Jump, best known for his portrayal of the bumbling Arthur
Carlson in the old sitcom, ``WKRP in Cincinnati,'' was decked out
in the blue-and-white Maytag repairman uniform as he addressed
workers at the plant.
   ``I have a Maytag washer and dryer in our home. I could not be
more proud to represent any product or group of people,'' Jump said.
   Jump, 56, replaced actor Jess White in March as the Maytag
Lonely Repairman, ending White's more than two decades in the job.
   ``This job was done so successfully for so many years by Jess. I
have the opportunity to take that role and do as good a job or
better without treading on the feet of someone who was here for 22
years,'' Jump said.
   The character of a lonely repairman was devised by Maytag to
promote a product the company said was so dependable the service
department rarely was called.
   Since Plant No. 2 started production, its workforce has swelled
from about 450 employees to some 2,500 who have produced about 42
million automatic washing machines and other appliances, said
Maytag spokesman Ron Krajnovich. Maytag, one of the units of the
more than $3 billion Maytag Corp., also employs another 1,000
people in another Newton location.
   At a noontime ceremony at the plant, company President Leonard
Hadley congratulated workers and also recognized 56 workers who
have each put in 40 years of service at the facility.
   After the brief ceremony, several workers asked Jump to
autograph the bills of their hats. They also presented him with a
scrapbook of advice and encouragement entitled, ``Loneliness
Lifeline: a Misery Manual for Dejection Protection _ from the
people who write the book on dependability.''

   A newly released book with nude photos of
a woman purported to be Premier Andreas Papandreou's girlfriend is
selling rapidly throughout the capital.
   The book's title, ``Liani Supports Change,'' is a pun referring
to Dimitra Liani, 35, and the ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement's slogan, ``People Support Change.''
   ``Sales have been fantastic and I'm sure I'll sell out today,''
said one newsstand owner.
   Two conservative newspapers and one left-wing journal, which
reprinted photos of the nude woman on its front page, said an
examination of the photographs determined they were authentic.
   Author George Karatzaferis said he would not disclose the origin
of the photographs.
   ``We've had the pictures for a while but decided to publish them
when Mr. Papandreou made clear he wants to identify Greece with
Liani,'' he said.
   Liani, a former Olympic Airways flight attendant, escorted
Papandreou, 70, during an official visit by Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega this week and at a meeting with Bulgarian leader
Todor Zhivkov last month.
   Papandreou filed for divorce in March from his American-born
wife, Margaret.

   Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson may

   Tyson, whose career began in nearby Catskill, was ticketed
Friday morning for speeding in his 1989 Lamborghini, said police
Sgt. Robert Wolfgang.
   Wolfgang said a police officer spotted Tyson's car and another
vehicle exceeding the 30 mph speed limit.
   ``It was not a clocked situation, but the officer determined
they were driving at a greater speed than is prudent for the
traffic conditions,'' Wolfgang said.
   Tyson and the other driver are scheduled to appear May 23 in

   If Elvis was the King of Rock 'n' Roll,
Linda Jones fancies herself the queen.
   ``I see my life, I see Elvis' life, and I feel there is a
connection,'' said Ms. Jones, 41, whose curling lip, jet-black hair
and high cheekbones are reminiscent of the rock 'n' roll legend.
   ``Ever since I was little, it was always Elvis with me. I'm a
big believer in fate,'' she said.
   Ms. Jones is hoping fate will intervene this weekend when she
auditions in Las Vegas for a showman who launched a nationwide
search for a female Elvis.
   If she impresses the directors as much in person as she did in
an audition videotape, Ms. Jones would be the only female in a show
whose other cast members are men impersonating women.
   Wearing Elvis-style jumpsuits and black sunglasses, and
swiveling her hips, Ms. Jones could easily pass for Presley in his
prime _ until she opens her mouth to sing.
   That's why she lip-syncs Elvis hits like ``Hound Dog'' and
``Don't Be Cruel.''
   Ms. Jones said she's not sure she'd leave her life in Gurnee for
the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas.
   ``Elvis is important to me and my act is important to me,'' Ms.
Jones said. ``I mean, I'd like to do this professionally and all,
but I don't want to give up my whole act for it.
   ``I'm not into this for the money. I love Elvis,'' she said,
tapping her heart, ``from here.''

   The White House says President Bush and West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl have failed in their latest round of
long-distance diplomacy to resolve major differences over nuclear
weapons in Europe.
   Bush and Kohl spoke by telephone for 20 minutes Friday about the
West German's proposal to soon open East-West talks on eliminating
short-range nuclear weapons in Europe. The White House said Bush
was unchanged in his opposition to such negotiations.
   The Bush-Kohl conversation came amid a flurry of developments on
other foreign policy fronts. In other news:
   _The White House announced Bush will visit Poland and Hungary in
July before going to the annual seven-nation economic summit in
Paris, to be held July 14-16. He will be the first president to
visit Eastern Europe since 1977. From Paris, Bush will travel
elsewhere in Europe, probably stopping in Portugal and the
Netherlands.
   _Over the objections of Panama, Bush named a 14-person
commission to observe what he predicts will be fraudulent elections
there Sunday. The observers, led by Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., leave
today and fly to a U.S. air base in Panama to avoid that nation's
visa requirements.
   _U.S. officials said Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
propose to the Soviet Union next week that negotiations to sharply
reduce strategic nuclear weapons be resumed in June in Geneva. He
will suggest that the talks pick up where they left off in November.
   The dispute between Bonn and Washington on short-range nuclear
weapons _ missiles and artillery shells _ threatens to mar the
harmony of a NATO summit scheduled May 29-30 in Brussels.
   The United States opposes any negotiations on grounds that NATO
needs nuclear weapons to compensate for the overwhelming
superiority of Soviet-bloc tanks, artillery, soldiers and other
conventional forces.
   ``The United States posture has not changed,'' White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said after the telephone call. ``It does
not appear that a basis for agreement is there, but we'll continue
to discuss it and see.''
   Fitzwater said, ``We would like to reach an agreement before the
NATO summit, but if we can't, it's not the end of the world.''
   ``We'll go to the summit and we'll discuss it there,'' he added.
``If we don't get an agreement at the summit, then we'll go on and
discuss it after the summit.''
   The spokesman voiced sharp skepticism about peace initiatives
proposed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and said the
Soviets are seeking to exploit the current NATO rift.
   ``The Soviets have worked assiduously to try to divide the
alliance,'' Fitzwater said. ``General Secretary Gorbachev has made
any number of proposals trying to convince people that there is no
longer a threat from the Soviet Union. And we are very wary of that
approach.''
   In Vienna, Soviet and East German diplomats used Friday's
resumption of East-West talks on conventional weapons to emphasize
Warsaw Pact support for parallel talks on reducing short-range
nuclear weapons.
   East German Ambassador Klaus-Dieter Ernst insisted such
negotiations are vital to Germans, telling a news conference: ``The
shorter the range of the rockets, the more dead Germans.''
   The Bush administration wants to modernize the aging arsenal of
Lance missiles clustered in Western Europe, most of them in West
Germany.
   Of Friday's Bush-Kohl phone conversation, Fitzwater said, ``I
would not characterize it as moving the situation one way or
another.''
   Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who met with
Bush this week, predicted a solution would be found at the summit
that links cuts in conventional and short-range nuclear arms agreed
on by the allies last year.
   Speaking at the National Press Club, Brundtland said Friday,
``We can negotiate for lower levels both in conventional and
short-range (weapons), and I do think it is possible to reach
common ground on that basis.''

<HEAD>Winner of $7.1 Million Colorado Lottery Sued By Wife For Alimony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ex-wife of a $7.1 million lottery winner has
sued for a share of his winnings, but the state was quicker to get
its cut.
   The lawsuit filed Friday seeks to force Colorado lottery winner
Albert Tecci to pay enough child support to ``enable his two sons
to have a standard of living on a par with their father,'' said
Edward C. Malik, attorney for Joan Tecci.
   Malik said Mrs. Tecci and her sons, Albert, 9, and Michael, 8,
have been living on welfare and food stamps since the Teccis
separated in 1981. She is seeking $1,000 a week in alimony, plus
child support and health and life insurance.
   Tecci, who lives in Colorado, agreed this week to reimburse the
state of Massachusetts for $25,000 of overdue child support
payments dating back to 1981. An arrest warrant had been issued
against him for failing to make $80 a week payments.
   Malik said none of the $25,000 will go to Mrs. Tecci. The state
will keep the money as partial reimbursement for welfare payments
made to the woman, he said.
   State officials were tipped off to Tecci's lottery winnings last
week by a resident who read a newspaper story about him, said Karen
Schwartzman, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Department of
Revenue.
   Tecci and his fiancee, Cheryl Penney, will receive 25 annual
installments of $134,725. They said they planned to use the
winnings to open a restaurant.
   ``I will keep up with all my moral and legal obligations,''
Tecci said Thursday. ``We're not ducking anyone.''

<HEAD>Anxious Riders Will Have to Wait For Splash Mountain Flume Ride</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Months of delays in opening Splash
Mountain, Disneyland's newest attraction, have left park executives
all wet and visitors disappointed.
   The nine-minute ride is designed around the adventures of Br'er
Rabbit and includes a 52{-foot plunge down a flume pitched at a
45-degree angle. It was to have opened in January, but officials
feared it packed too much splash and delayed the debut while
workers toned down the big dive.
   ``I got soaking wet one day and had to get out and change
clothes,'' said Tony W. Baxter, the ride's executive producer, who
has tested the ride.
   Engineers have redesigned the ride's log boats, trimming their
capacity from eight passengers to seven and replacing their heavy
shells with lighter fiberglass.
   The ride is likely to open this summer, although no date has
been set, spokesman Bob Roth said Friday.
   ``I think there's an expectation with Disneyland that the
quality will be top-notch. You may get a little wet but not
soaked,'' said Roth.
   Aaron Kreitzer, a 17-year-old visitor from Portland, Ore., was
disappointed to find the ride still closed. ``We heard it was going
to be open from the pilot on the plane coming down,'' he said.
   The delay also has disappointed McDonald's Corp. and Coca-Cola
Co. Both companies scheduled promotions to coincide with the
expected January opening and found out about the delays too late to
postpone the promotions.
   ``Obviously, we would have liked it if it could have opened as
planned,'' said Greg Hogan, a regional manager for McDonald's.

   Burglary suspects fleeing in a chase
that reached speeds of 100 mph stopped to pay a 50-cent toll at an
unattended booth where many motorists don't pay, enabling police to
catch one of them.
   Police said they spotted two men who had backed a car up to a
western-style clothing store and fled with clothing valued at $900
early Thursday.
   The men raced off well ahead of police, but officers caught up
to the car when the men stopped to pay the toll at an unattended,
automatic toll booth at an entrance to the Sawgrass Expressway
about 30 miles north of Miami, said police spokeswoman Judie
Weinflash.
   James Warren, 24, of West Palm Beach was arrested and charged
with burglary, grand theft, reckless driving, having no valid
driver's license and fleeing and eluding police. The other suspect
escaped on foot, police said.
   Only 60 percent of commuters who use the Sawgrass pay the toll,
according to the Florida Department of Transportation.

   The attorney for a group of Hispanic FBI
agents in a discrimination suit against the agency called a judge's
order a victory for all agents.
   A federal judge's ruling Friday ordering changes in the way the
FBI promotes minorities makes the bureau a better place for
everyone regardless of ethnic origin or sex, said Antonio Silva,
attorney for the 311 Hispanic agents in the class-action suit.
   ``The changes that have been ordered are lasting,'' he said.
``The effort is to eradicate discrimination within the FBI to make
it a place where decisions on promotion and career advancement are
made on merit and ability and nothing else.''
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton called the FBI's current
system of promotion ``excessively subjective'' and lacking means of
review. But he decided against instituting a quota system for the
agency and awarding the agents back pay or other monetary damages.
   The case stemmed from a discrimination suit filed in 1987 by
agent Bernardo M. ``Mat'' Perez.
   Ruling on damages in the suit after finding in September that
discrimination existed, Bunton said the FBI can take other steps to
make sure Hispanics, who make up less than 5 percent of the FBI's
9,000 agents, get the experience they need for career advancement.
   ``The imposition of quotas or preferential promotion are drastic
remedies which should be ordered only upon a showing that the
discriminating employer has resisted less intrusive reforms,''
Bunton said.
   Bunton ordered appointment of special masters to determine
whether individual Hispanic agents in the suit were wrongfully
denied promotions within the FBI. Up to 200 Hispanic agents could
be eligible for promotion under the ordered reforms.
   The judge also reinforced the power of the FBI's national career
board and stripped local FBI agents in charge of the power to
override career board decisions.
   Bunton acknowledged the FBI has ``taken significant steps'' to
curb discrimination since his initial ruling against the bureau in
September, but said they were not enough.
   He said that some FBI reforms already instituted ``while
well-intentioned, are fine-tuning of a system that requires more
dramatic repair.''
   Agent Paul Magallanes, one of three lead plaintiffs in the case,
said Friday in Los Angeles that the ruling will benefit all agents
by requiring the bureau to use objective criteria for promotion.
   He also said the FBI will benefit.
   ``They were depriving themselves of the talent that Hispanic
agents offer the FBI _ in terms of management, in terms of
intelligence, in terms of our culture,'' said Magallanes, who told
reporters he had been passed over for promotion half a dozen times
since 1971.
   The 21-year FBI veteran said he and others were assigned to a
``taco circuit'' of assignments, including low-level field work in
Hispanic neighborhoods and translation duties.
   In a prepared statement, FBI Director William S. Sessions cited
improvements the bureau has made in career development, language
services and equal employment opportunity programs for minorities
and women.
   ``We are looking with care at Judge Bunton's ruling with an eye
toward building further on the many improvements already undertaken
in the FBI's personnel practices,'' Sessions said.

annual World Peace Through World Health Award from President John
F. Kennedy 1961 and was profiled by Time magazine in a 1959 cover
story on cancer research.
   He retired to Bethesda in 1965 and worked as a consultant to the
American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute.
   Heller was born in Fair Play, S.C. He graduated from Clemson
College in 1925 and from Emory University Medical School in 1929.
   He worked for the U.S. Public Health Service in Little Rock,
Brunswick, Ga., Nashville, Tuskeegee, Ala., Boston and Harrisburg,

   The FBI agent who sued the bureau for
denying him promotions believes the door is open for him and other
Hispanics to advance, but Bernardo M. ``Mat'' Perez concedes the
door had to be kicked down.
   ``We, Hispanics, as any other American citizens, have a
contribution to make and we want to believe in the American
system,'' he said after a federal judge ordered changes in the
agency's promotional system and established a procedure for
promoting Hispanics wrongly denied advancement.
   ``All we want is an equal chance. Now we're going to get it.''
   Because Hispanics do the same jobs as other FBI agents, they
deserve to obtain management positions, the 25-year veteran said.
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton, after ruling in September
that the FBI discriminated against Hispanics, ordered a special
panel to be appointed to evaluate the claims of other Hispanic
agents in the class-action suit that they lost promotions.
   Perez, the No. 2 agent in El Paso and the agency's
second-highest ranking Hispanic, filed suit in 1987 after a series
of demotions and fruitless internal complaints about his treatment.
Formerly agent in charge in San Juan, Puerto Rico, he was dropped
to assistant agent in charge in Los Angeles.
   There, he claimed, agent in charge Richard Bretzing disliked him
because he was Hispanic.
   When Perez testified against Richard Miller, the only FBI agent
ever convicted of espionage, Bretzing accused Perez of committing
perjury and forced him to transfer to El Paso, a place Perez says
the FBI considers a ``dumping ground.''
   Perez thinks he would have been an FBI executive assistant
director if he had not been discriminated against. ``I think I can
do a lot more than I've been doing here for the past few years in
El Paso,'' he said.
   More than 300 Hispanic agents eventually joined the class-action
suit. Because of Friday's ruling, the FBI must promote Perez to the
next level in the bureau within 45 days.
   Additionally, FBI Director William S. Sessions must report to
the court every 90 days on promotional decisions regarding Perez
until the agent becomes a special agent in charge or is named to a
job with similar responsibilities.
   Perez said the promotion is a small one and won't affect his
salary, already at the top level.
   ``I was not held back money-wise and that was not my
contention,'' he said. ``I was not promoted within the FBI.''
   Bunton denied any monetary damages to Perez, who claimed more
than $600,000 in back pay and for damages for retaliation against
him by the FBI.
   In December, Bunton ruled the agency had misused a federal grand
jury subpoena to investigate Perez in retaliation for filing the
suit.
   And Perez said he may see more retaliation result from the
latest ruling.
   ``I would not be surprised if it comes,'' he said. ``I hope
(Sessions) will look upon it as a challenge. His friend, Judge
Bunton, has tried to be non-intrusive.''
   Before he was named FBI director in 1987, Sessions was a federal
judge in the western district of Texas and a colleague of Bunton.
   Despite discrimination and retaliation, Perez said he does not
blame Sessions for the racial problems within the FBI.
   ``I think he was given a bag by former Director (William)
Webster,'' Perez said. ``(Webster) put this system in place.''

<TEXT>
   Voters in Texas today were choosing mayors in four
cities, three where it was expected to be no contest, and in El
Paso, where six candidates were vying to replace volatile
millionaire Jonathan Rogers.
   Incumbents in Dallas and Fort Worth were virtually assured
re-election and a former mayor was expecting to return to the post
in San Antonio.
   Political observers in El Paso were anticipating a runoff in the
race for Rogers' seat. Rogers, who served four, two-year terms, is
prevented by law from seeking a fifth.
   City Council members Suzie Azar and Ed Elsey and state Rep. Paul
Moreno were the favorites to advance to a May 27 runoff. Ms. Azar
has won the endorsement of the border city's two newspapers.
   Some candidates passed out campaign literature and shook hands
with voters amid rush-hour traffic in El Paso Friday, the most
vigorous activity at the end of a low-key campaign season.
   In Dallas, Mayor Annette Strauss and her leading challenger,
attorney Peter Lesser, attended Cinco de Mayo festivities.
   A poll last week showed Strauss was favored by 53 percent of
those surveyed. Lesser, who leads a pack of three challengers, was
next with 6 percent, according to the poll for The Dallas Morning
News. But the poll also found 37 percent were undecided.
   ``We think it's going to be a horse race,'' Kevin Kennedy, a
spokesman for Lesser's campaign, said Friday. ``We think we're
going to surprise a lot of people. There's definitely anti-Strauss
people out there. It's going to come down to who gets their forces
out.''
   In San Antonio, former Mayor Lila Cockrell led a field of seven
candidates.
   ``The absentee turnout was really low and we're trying to send
out messages that we need to get the vote out,'' said Ms.
Cockrell's campaign spokeswoman, Stacy McGhee. ``Ms. Cockrell feels
it will be a victory if there is a good turnout.''
   ``My guess is that the smaller the turnout the better it is for
me,'' said Carl Mauthe, an insurance executive who is considered
Ms. Cockrell's main opposition for the seat.
   Ms. Cockrell was mayor of the city from 1975 to 1981, preceding
current Mayor Henry Cisneros, who decided last year against running
for a fifth term.
   In Fort Worth, Mayor Bob Bolen was participating in his third
straight election without strong opposition. One candidate opposing
Bolen, Carlos Adams, had raised no money for the campaign during
the first three months of the year. A second candidate, Evelyn
Thomas Williams, did not file a campaign contribution report for
the period.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic church and
international observers led by two former U.S. presidents urged
Panamanians to vote peacefully and asked the government to conduct
free and fair presidential elections Sunday.
   About 1.1 million Panamanians are registered to vote in an
election that also will pick two vice presidents, a 67-member
National Assembly and 510 municipal council members.
   Relations between Panama and the United States _ strained over
the confrontation between the U.S. government and strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega _ are the main issues in the campaign.
   President Bush and Panama's domestic opposition have claimed the
government plans to rig the elections to gain victory for its
candidate, Carlos Duque, a close business associate of Noriega who
is backed by an eight-party pro-government coalition.
   Duque's rival is Guillermo Endara, nominated by the three-party
opposition coalition.
   Both sides have warned of possible violence following the
election.
   Already the opposition's news media have been closed down by the
government; their access to radio and television outlets too is
limited.
   The winner will take office Sept. 1, replacing acting President
Manuel Solis Palma, who took power after Noriega engineered the
ouster of President Eric Delvalle in February 1988. Delvalle, still
recognized as president by the United States, tried to fire Noriega
after the general was indicted on drug trafficking charges last
year in Florida.
   Former presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford are in Panama as
part of a delegation from the private Council of Freely Elected
Heads of Government, which Carter heads. The council was invited by
the Panamanian government to serve as observers.
   Carter signed with then-Panamanian dictator Gen. Omar Torrijos
the 1977 Canal treaties that grant Panama total control over the
waterway on Dec. 31, 1999, when the United States is to abandon its
military installations in Panama.
   ``We come here as friends of Panama to bear witness to what we
hope will be a free and fair election,'' Carter said Friday. ``This
election is so crucial for the people of this country and for all
of us interested in democracy and good relations between the United
States and Panama.''
   The former president refused to discuss U.S. policy when asked
about his opinion of the economic sanctions imposed by the United
States, which include freezing Panamanian government funds in the
United States and withholding Panama Canal fees.
   Carter said he felt that democratization of Panama, ``one of the
goals'' of Torrijos, has not been fulfilled yet. ``Free and fair
elections provide an opportunity to move toward these goals by
promoting national reconciliation.''
   Carter and his delegation met with the leaders of the two
presidential tickets Friday night.
   Also late Friday, a group of young military officers led by
Capt. Ricardo Sanchez Galan went on national television to urge
people to get out the vote.
   The officers' statement said Panamanians should vote ``to avoid
fighting between brothers and not fall victim to provocation.''
   Meanwhile, Mons. Marcos McGrath, archbishop of Panama, also
called for free and fair elections and said it was ``a crucial hour
for Panama that could be our last opportunity to resolve our
differences peacefully. We know how terrible it would be to seek a
solution by force of arms, by violence provoked internally or
externally.''
   He asked the Defense Forces, headed by Noreiga, to ``watch over
the security and tranquility of the electoral process.''
   McGrath is scheduled to meet Carter and his delegation today. In
Washington, Bush named an official delegation of congressmen and
private citizens to monitor the elections, but Panamanian officials
refused to recognize it.
   The delegation was expected to come to Howard Air Base, a U.S.
installation near Panama City, because it would not need Panamanian
visas, recently required of all visiting Americans, to land there.
   Panamanian government officials said it was not likely the U.S.
representatives would be allowed to visit the polling places.
   The Panamanian government has invited observers from Latin
America, some Caribbean countries and Europe. The opposition also
invited a group of politicians from other countries.

<HEAD>ABA, Thornburgh Feud Over Judicial Screening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is
threatening to end the American Bar Association's role in screening
prospective federal judges unless it agrees not to consider
political or ideological beliefs.
   The ABA's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary would no
longer screen prospective nominees unless the bar group keeps a
commitment that it made to made to Thornburgh, says David Runkel, a
senior aide to the attorney general.
   The ABA denies it made such a commitment.
   As he left the Justice Department on Friday night, Thornburgh
said ``we expect them to honor'' an agreement to revert to pre-1980
language in the ABA's judicial screening guidelines.
   The 1977 version does not contain any exception to the statement
that political and ideological views are not considered.
   Subsequent versions of the guidelines contain an exception that
such views are considered if they bear on the candidate's ability
to be a fair, impartial and open-minded judge.
   It is this language that Thornburgh and others cite as evidence
that the ABA has been using political and ideological views as
yardsticks for a candidate's fitness for the federal bench.
   The ABA says it never agreed to what Thornburgh described in
testimony Tuesday to the House Judiciary Committee. The dispute
broke out that day when ABA leaders took issue with Thornburgh's
statement.
   The Justice Department fired back on Friday.
   Runkel said the screening panel would be allowed to resume its
traditional role of helping the president screen prospective
judicial candidates ``as soon as the statement made by the attorney
general to the House Judiciary Committee is .... accepted by the
ABA.'' Runkel said.
   In a statement Friday night, ABA President Robert Raven
reiterated the bar group's position that the ``federal judicial
committee does not examine and make value judgments about
candidates' political or ideological views.''
   ``Problems of wording and problems of perception are curable,''
Raven said. ``We look forward to working out mutually acceptable
language with the attorney general.''
   Thorburgh replied: ``They got our language, go back to what it
was in 1979. That's what they agreed to and we expect them to honor
it.''
   The issue is especially ticklish for Thornburgh because his
choice for deputy attorney general, Robert B. Fiske Jr., has come
under fire from some conservative Republicans for the role he
played chairing the Standing Committee from 1984 to 1987.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., charges that Fiske leaked the
names of prospective nominees the panel received from the White
House to a liberal advocacy group.
   The advance information, Humphrey charges, enabled the group to
mount campaigns against individuals even before their candidates
were nominated.
   In apparent attempt to mollify Humphrey and others, Thornburgh
credited Fiske with negotiating the ``agreement'' when he made his
announcement to the House committee.
   The ABA's involvement in judicial screening, which dates back to
the Eisenhower administration, has become a heated one for
conservatives since the 1987 Senate vote against confirming Robert
Bork to the Supreme Court.
   Four members of the bar panel found Bork unqualified and Harold
R. Tyler Jr., the panel's chairman, explained at the time the
dissenters were concerned about what they regarded as Bork's
``comparatively extreme views'' on constitutional issues.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee has planned to hold hearings on
the whole issue of the ABA's involvement in judicial screening,
including the ratings it announces during confirmation proceedings.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the panel's chairman, Friday
postponed the May 11 hearing so that it would not conflict with
Thornburgh's schedule. Thornburgh is now expected to testify, along
with representatives of the ABA and interest groups.

<HEAD>Life Without Chlorofluorocarbons: Less Comfortable, More Costly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Within 10 years, the world may be rid
of a range of chemicals that have been part of daily life since the
refrigerator replaced the icebox.
   Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, are used to make foam cushions for
car seats, furniture and carpet underlays. They go into Styrofoam
packaging, hamburger cartons and throwaway coffee cups.
   They are used in refrigerators, freezers and air conditioners.
They are found in heating pumps and building insulation.
   Dry cleaners use CFCs. Computer companies rely on CFCs to clean
tiny electronic components. CFCs go into varnishes and metal
cleaners.
   The problem is that when CFCs rise 15 to 25 miles into the
atmosphere, they destroy the earth's precious shield of ozone.
Scientists say less ozone means more ultraviolet radiation from the
sun streams to Earth, increasing skin cancer, causing eye disease
and damaging marine and plant life, which treatens the food chain.
   A four-day U.N.-sponsored conference on protecting the ozone
layer ended Friday. It called for a worldwide ban on the production
and use of CFCs by the end of the century, even though CFCs have an
atmospheric life of up to 100 years.
   The conference also called for phasing out halons, gases used in
firefighting equipment, but it gave no deadline.
   In some cases, the CFC ban may hardly be noticed.
   In the United States, for example, aerosol cans using CFCs as
propellants have been banned since 1978, except those used for
medical needs. Similar measures have also been adopted by Canada,
Sweden, Norway and Finland.
   However, 80 percent of aerosol sprays in Western Europe still
contain CFCs. Aerosol sprays also are common in Mexico and South
America as well as in Japan, which produces about 10 percent of the
world's CFCs.
   Without the compounds, the world may find life generally a
little less comfortable and more expensive.
   Scientists reported to the conference, attended by 81 nations
and over 100 non-government observers, on efforts to develop
alternatives for the compounds.
   ``We do have a lot of substitutes available,'' said Victor
Buxton of Canada's Ministry of Environment.
   ``But we don't have the technical options right now to
completely eliminate CFCs. That doesn't mean we might not have it
next year or the year after,'' said Buxton.
   ``If you ask me what is the Achilles heel of this program, I
think it is refrigeration and existing equipment. We're not talking
about comfort here, but about preserving food supplies,'' he said.
   Buxton said CFC consumption could be sharply cut immediately
through ``good housekeeping,'' such as plugging leaks in air
conditioners and ending such ``frivolous'' uses such as making
party streamers.
   Other changes could be made. Water could be used instead of CFCs
to clean circuit boards on computers, and metals could be washed in
acid baths, as they once were. Refrigeration can be done with
ammonia or helium.
   Scientists are scrambling for new technologies. Major companies
have joined to test a family of halogenated CFCs, or HCFCs.
   The new compounds dump far less ozone-damaging chlorine into the
air but show many of the useful properties of CFCs, said Kevin Fay,
head of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy.
   In theory, HCFCs could be used to replace cooling liquid in
refrigerators. Thus, new equipment would not be needed.
   Fay said U.S. industry alone has spent up to $10 billion
researching HCFCs, but he said not much is known about them yet. If
they prove inadequate, he said, the CFC phaseout target of 1999
would be impossible to meet.
   In addition, the environmental group Greenpeace opposes the use
of HCFCs. It says the atmosphere cannot absorb more chlorine, even
at a reduced rate.
   The developing countries at the conference said they need help
to develop alternative technologies and products. Delegates agreed
to set up a world climate fund, but they left the financing up in
the air.

<HEAD>Alaska Oil Spill Cleanup Chief Wants More Effort From Exxon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's personal emissary at the
Alaska oil spill told Exxon to hasten its cleanup and said the
company should put a lot more people to work scrubbing the
oil-tainted shores.
   Adm. Paul A. Yost Jr., the commandant of the Coast Guard and the
ranking federal official in the oil spill zone, also said Friday
that Exxon's May 10 deadline to have the worst of the cleanup
completed on five islands in Prince William Sound may be in
jeopardy.
   A beach at Smith Island, one of the five targeted islands, ``is
not yet anywhere near clean,'' he said. ``I can't see when it will
be clean. It may be that we have to bypass that beach for two or
three weeks and then return to it.''
   Contamination on the islands is of special concern to state
officials and environmentalists, who fear the annual seal pupping
cycle may be affected.
   ``What I said to Exxon this morning is that they are going to
have to produce a significantly greater effort,'' the admiral said,
adding that Exxon should also expand its beach cleanup to areas
outside Prince William Sound.
   ``How many people?'' Yost said. ``I'm not ready to give them a
number yet.''
   Exxon has about 4,900 people involved in the cleanup effort,
according to figures supplied by the oil company and the state.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez struck a charted reef in the sound on
March 24, spilling more than 10 million gallons of crude. The
captain, Joseph Hazelwood of Huntington, N.Y., has been accused of
operating the vessel while drunk and he faces trial June 20 in
Valdez. An Alaska grand jury has also begun a felony investigation
into Hazelwood's role in the accident.
   Hazelwood's attorney said Friday the fired tanker captain was
not drunk when he left the vessel in command of his third mate
prior to the shipwreck.
   The oil has moved about 500 miles southwest of Valdez, fouling
the shore at several sites, including the Katmai National Park
wildlife refuge.
   ``I'd like to state right now for the people of Alaska, we don't
have hundreds of miles of heavily impacted beaches outside of
Prince William Sound,'' Yost said.
   Yost must approve Exxon's cleanup plan before it goes into
effect, but said he has not yet made a decision.
   Earlier this week, Yost criticized the revised plan, which Exxon
submitted May 1, as poorly drafted and lacking in specifics. The
state also has criticized it and urged extensive changes. But on
Friday, he called the plan ``workable ... but it needs expansion.''
   ``Some of the cleanup is difficult to the point that one wonders
if restoration will ever be possible,'' Yost said.
   ``Restoration will probably be done by the Lord in the next few
years. I don't think restoration is going to be done by Exxon in
the next few months on all of the beaches,'' he said. ``It's not
possible.''
   Under Exxon's proposal, 364 miles of coastline would be cleansed
by Sept. 15, although nearly 200 of those miles may be left
untouched _ to be scoured by wind and wave action. The worst of the
spill damage in Prince William Sound is to be cleaned by May 10,
according to the plan.
   The proposal seeks to dispose of waste by burying it, burning it
or discharging it through a wastewater treatment plant in Valdez.
The company has asked for permission to bypass some environmental
laws in order to dispose of the wastes.

<HEAD>Alleged Killer Pleads Innocent; Inmates Collect Money For Daughter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH CARTIERE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A winery worker pleaded innocent to
killing his wife, two daughters and four others, while his fellow
inmates raised $900 for another daughter who survived the bloody
rampage.
   Ramon Salcido appeared glum and unshaven in a heavily guarded
courtroom where he entered his innocent pleas on the seven murder
counts Friday.
   He also pleaded innocent to three counts of attempted murder and
denied a special circumstance allegation that could send him to the
gas chamber.
   One of the attempted murder counts is for an attack on Salcido's
3-year-old daughter, Carmina. Her father allegedly slit her throat
during the April 14 killing spree in the bucolic wine country north
of San Francisco.
   Concern for the little girl prompted hundreds of prisoners at
the Sonoma County jail, where Salcido is being kept, to collect
$900 during two ``days of peace'' Wednesday and Thursday.
   ``These guys dug down to every cent they literally had in their
pockets. They are going to go without cigarettes and other basic
necessities because they want to reach out of their anger and
despair and direct something positive to Carmina,'' said the Rev.
Bob Gutleben.
   Gutleben runs Covenant Connection, a non-denominational ministry
to inmates and ex-convicts. He said 90 percent of the jail's 690
prisoners participated in the collection and the two-day pledge of
non-violence.
   The fund-raising idea came from an inmate counseling group run
by Gutleben. He noted the inmates normally have an unofficial code
calling for the maiming or killing of child murderers.
   ``I've had enough of violence; and what was done to her was pure
evil,'' said Gabriel Menjou, 42, an inmate serving time for
forgery. ``I wanted her to know that men don't have to be mean and
cruel, but to know that they can be loving, kind and caring.''
   Sheriff's deputies have been concerned about Salcido's safety
since he was captured in Mexico on April 19. He was brought back to
the county jail the next night, where a furious crowd of 200 people
shouted, ``Kill him.''
   Weather stripping was added to his cell door to prevent inmates
from slipping harmful items inside. Authorities also put up a large
metal plate to keep other inmates from looking into Salcido's cell
through an interior window.
   When he is moved from this third-floor cell for showers,
exercise or court appointments, all of the 50 to 60 inmates on the
floor are locked in. Salcido also is under a 24-hour suicide watch.
   About 20 sheriff's deputies stood guard inside and outside the
courtroom, searching bags and passing metal detectors over
spectators as they entered.
   The 28-year-old winery worker is charged with killing Carmina's
mother and two sisters, his mother-in-law and her two young
daughters, and a co-worker he told detectives he believed was
having an affair with his wife.
   He also is charged with the attempted murder of Carmina and of
trying to kill another co-worker and the man's wife.
   Salcido listened to the proceedings through a court-provided
interpreter but answered the judge in English, saying ``Yes, your
honor,'' in a barely audible voice.
   In addition to pleading innocent to all charges, Salcido also
denied a special circumstance allegation of multiple murder, which
could bring a death sentence or life in prison without parole.
   Municipal Court Judge Knoel Owen scheduled a preliminary hearing
for Sept. 11 and refused to lift a gag order. Deputy District
Attorney Peter Bumerts said lifting the order would almost
certainly force a change of venue.

<DATELINE>ALTES LAGER, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the 1,400 Soviet soldiers
stationed in this base 42 miles from Berlin pack up and move out,
they will leave with few memories of Germany.
   From Russian-language films at the enlisted men's club to
Borzhomi mineral water brought in from Soviet Georgia, the soldiers
have lived an entirely self-contained existence and they say
they've had virtually no chance to commune with the locals.
   The Soviets who tinkered with their freshly painted equipment in
a carefully orchestrated show for foreign journalists Friday are
among the 50,000 troops and 5,000 tanks the Kremlin is withdrawing
from Eastern Europe in a disarmament gesture aimed at spurring
similar concessions from NATO.
   The hurriedly organized tour of the base that houses the
Vislensky tank regiment comes in advance of the pullout's start on
May 17, and appeared intended to cast the Kremlin in a peacemaking
role during an inter-NATO dispute over the pace and course of
disarmament.
   But the visit for 118 journalists offered a rare glimpse into
the everyday life of Soviet soldiers abroad and confirmed long-held
beliefs that the lot of these foreign-based fighting men is one of
isolation and monotony.
   Asked if enlisted men could spend their free time outside the
concrete-slab walls surrounding barracks bordered by skeletal trees
killed by acid rain, 19-year-old Vasily Yamkovoi replied ``rarely.''
   He and others said army regulations prevent them from leaving
the compound except for officially organized excursions to sights
like Berlin's World War II memorials.
   A cocoon of Soviet life is spun around the grim encampment, from
the framed photographs of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
hanging over the rows of cots to the barracks reading rooms stocked
with Communist Party literature and political works by sanctioned
Soviet writers.
   Soldiers said they are allowed to send home two letters per week
and mail boxes are bolted to the wall at the barracks entrance, one
``for letters'' and the other ``for letters that have already been
read.''
   Col. Alexander Kireyev, head of the base political department,
described the second letter drop as a sort of diplomatic pouch to
protect official communications. Posters adorning the walls warn
the soldiers to guard against unwitting disclosure of military
secrets.
   The mess hall favors Russian dishes like fried cabbage, borsch
and solyanka _ a spicy broth afloat with fatty sausage and pickled
vegetables.
   Entertainment, according to soldiers like Oleg Tarabychkin of
Kiev, is a free hour to write home or a night at the base movie
theater.
   For the enlisted men it's a lonely life; they serve two-year
terms with no home leaves and their families must remain behind.
The Soviet base, like others abroad, employs no local workers and
the only women on the site are the wives of their commanding
officers.
   The weaponry under the control of the Vislensky regiment has
been dismissed by Western officials as outmoded. NATO has contended
its removal will make little difference in the balance of forces
between East and West.
   But the chief of staff for Soviet forces in East Germany, Lt.
Col. Valery I. Fursin, claimed the T-64 tanks, anti-aircraft guns,
tactical missiles and other arms to be withdrawn are modern and a
significant sacrifice.
   ``We have always contended we have parity with the West,'' he
replied when asked how the reductions would affect the conventional
weapons balance.
   The cutback of Soviet forces from East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and Poland was announced by Gorbachev last December in a
speech to the United Nations. Western experts estimate the Kremlin
has 500,000 soldiers in Eastern Europe, so the withdrawal is
expected to reduce that force by about 10 percent yet still remain
numerically stronger than NATO.
   The 94 tanks stationed with the Vislensky regiment were having
their guns removed in preparation for the return to Soviet
territory on flatbed train cars that is to begin heading east on
May 17.
   Fursin said more than 4,000 tanks would be removed from East
Germany by the end of next year, or ``about 40 percent'' of the
number now deployed.
   Of the 50,000 soldiers leaving the East bloc, about 10,000 will
come out of East German bases, he said.
   Political officer Maj.-Gen. Vasily Kazachenko deflected
suggestions that the unusual base visit was aimed at scoring some
public relations points during a dispute among NATO members about
whether the United States should open early talks on short-range
nuclear missiles with the Kremlin.
   Washington would negotiate only after significant reductions in
Soviet conventional weapons, while West Germany, where most of the
short-range missiles are based, favors talks now.

   Thunderstorms packing tornadoes, high winds and heavy rain raked
the South on Friday, leaving thousands of people without power,
destroying numerous homes and trapping some residents inside. At
least 15 people were killed.
   Three people died in Lincoln County, North Carolina, when a
twister struck Friday evening, according to the state emergency
management office in Raleigh. The tornado touched down first in
Lawndale in adjacent Cleveland County at about 7 p.m.
   ``It went north by northeast, leveling homes and everything in
its path,'' said Gene Morrison of the Lawndale Rescue Squad.
Seventeen people were injured, some seriously, he said.
   ``It's like you took a chain saw and cut down all the trees and
leveled all the houses,'' said Bill Seagle, a member of the Upper
Cleveland Rescue Squad. ``Cars were thrown all over the place.''
   The twister struck near the Cleveland-Lincoln county line and
authorities initially reported that three people died in each
county. Cleveland County officials later confirmed that there were
no deaths in their jurisdiction.
   The storms, which followed major damage Thursday in Texas and
Louisiana, also ripped up houses and downed trees and power lines
in South Carolina, Kentucky, Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama. And
hail as big as baseballs fell near Lufkin in eastern Texas.
   In New Orleans, the storm ripped at least one of the Jazz and
Heritage Festival's big tents, blew others down and did some damage
to nearly all of the 10 stages and tents where 140,000 people
gathered over three days last weekend, said spokeswoman Anna
Zimmerman.
   Friday's daytime activities _ including dozens of concerts on
stages and tents set up among food booths and craft exhibits _ were
canceled so crews could pull things back together. A concert
scheduled Friday night was moved to the city's municipal auditorium.
   At least three people died, including an infant, and several
were injured in Spartanburg County, S.C., when tornadoes touched
down in the evening, authorities said.
   In Gainesville, Ga., a tornado hit near Interstate 985, injuring
at least nine people, most in auto accidents, Civil Defense
Director Bill Banks said. Two victims were in critical condition.
   ``We had at least two vehicles blown into the woods upside down,
one van and one automobile,'' said Reggie Forrester, Hall County
public safety director. ``We had a van upside down on the entrance
ramp. ... We had several other vehicles blown around and
overturned.''
   Another twister that hit the western Kentucky city of West
Louisville destroyed one house and damaged four others.
   In North Carolina, four people trapped in a house were rescued,
but two were seriously injured, authorities said. Others were
reportedly trapped in vehicles.
   Late Thursday, several tornadoes roared through the north Texas
town of Granbury, sending 22 people to a hospital for treatment of
minor injuries.
   ``It was just like they always said: you could hear it coming,
it came and then we shook for a long time. We all prayed,'' said
Elvin Funkhouser. He and his wife, Janet, lay in their ground-floor
kitchen while twisters shredded the second story of their home in a
subdivision near Granbury.
   Hood County Sheriff Edwin Tomlinson said at least 15 trailers
and homes were destroyed, with about 200 others damaged. But Red
Cross spokesman Richard Hensley said 65 trailers and houses were
destroyed.
   Wind speeds of near 100 mph were reported Thursday in
thunderstorms in Texas from Dallas County to near Waco, the weather
service said. Gusts to 78 mph were reported at Wichita Falls,
Texas, and to 80 to 90 mph at Eldorado, Okla.
   The storms derailed a train in Hurst, a suburb northeast of Fort
Worth. Early Thursday, high wind derailed 10 empty cars of a coal
train near the Panhandle community of Dawn. No one was injured.
   The weather also was blamed for one death in Oklahoma and seven
in Texas, most of them drownings. The body of a man whose truck was
found in a Texas creek was found later Friday.
   About 255,000 customers in north-central and eastern Texas lost
electricity because of the storms, and 27,500 remained without
power late Friday, said Dave Fiorelli, a senior engineer for Texas
Utilities Electric in Dallas. He said it was the greatest number of
disruptions he could remember since a January 1979 ice storm
paralyzed northern Texas.
   Power lines were extensively damaged in Louisiana. Officials of
Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. worked throughout the day to return
power to some 12,000 homes throughout the state Friday. ``That's
down from 50,000 last night,'' Mike Sanders of Louisiana Power &amp;
Light Co. said Friday.
   A string of 89 high-voltage transmission towers toppled in a
50-mile stretch from Tallulah, La., across the Mississippi River to
Vicksburg, Miss. The towers were 65 feet tall.
   ``We surmise the towers were knocked down by tornadoes and a
domino effect,'' said Charles Thacker of LP&amp;L.
   Standing water closed several highways for a time Friday around
Louisiana, including Interstate 20, which was under up to 5 feet of
water near West Monroe, state police said.
   Sheriff's deputies said one man's body was found in about two
feet of water in Calhoun in northern Louisiana and two others were
missing, including a 9-year-old boy.
   Rain amounts in Louisiana included 11.81 inches at Ruston, 10.51
in Calhoun, 9.31 at Monroe and 8.51 at Oak Ridge, said Ernest
Ethridge of the weather service. Hail as big as baseballs fell on
parts of northern Louisiana.
   An undetermined number of homes were evacuated because of
flooding in Monroe, West Monroe, Lincoln Parish and Shreveport. The
Ouachita Parish, Morehouse Parish and Monroe city school systems
closed for the day.

<HEAD>Tourist Plane Lands in Jungle Near Cancun</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANCUN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tourist plane carrying up to 17
Americans was forced to make an emergency landing Friday afternoon
in the jungles of the Yucatan peninsula after an engine failed,
rescuers and reporters said.
   There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries and it was
not immediately clear if the three-engine British-made Trislander
crashed while trying to land.
   The Aerocozumel plane flying from the archeological site of
Chichen Itza to the island resort of Cozumel made an emergency
landing about two miles outside the Playa del Carmen airport, about
15 miles south of Cancun.
   The Excelsior news agency said the aircraft, which was filled to
capacity and had one pilot, landed after one of its engines went
out. It said all passengers were believed to be American.
   While the jungle terrain hampered rescue operations, authorities
managed to air-drop food and medicine.
   Cmdr. Agustin Ortega Martin del Campo, army commander for the
region about 900 miles east of Mexico City, said a helicopter
reached the plane but was unable to land because of jungle growth.
   Speaking by telephone from Cancun, he said about 30 Mexican
soldiers were going overland to the site but were slowed by the
jungle terrain and lack of nearby roads.
   Diego Acosta, commander of the Red Cross in Cancun, said
military crews were cutting a route through the jungle to reach the
plane.
   He said the helicopter that overflew the site said there was no
fire.
   There had been no contact with the people aboard, he said.

   A dog belonging to Queen Elizabeth II died after
being bitten in a fight with other royal dogs at Windsor Castle,
Buckingham Palace said.
   Chipper, a 12-year-old cross between a dachshund and a corgi,
was involved in a fight started by Ranger, a corgi belonging to
Queen Mother Elizabeth, the palace said Friday.
   The crossbreed, known as a dorgi, was stitched up after the
fight by a veterinarian but died, the palace said.
   The queen was given a corgi by her parents in the 1930s when she
was a little princess. They became the royal family's most popular
house dogs because of their small size but palace staff and
visitors say the dogs tend to snap at ankles.
   Princess Margaret, the queen's sister, preferred dachshunds.

   The state has taken custody of a couple's
15-month-old son while the pair is investigated in the death of a
daughter they reported abducted under circumstances mirroring
another daughter's death three years ago.
   The boy ``might be in jeopardy,'' police said.
   Robert and Paula Sims are the ``focus of the investigation'' in
the death of 6-week-old Heather Sims, whose reported disappearance
was similar to that of her sister in 1986.
   ``We feel very strong that we will eventually make an arrest in
this case,'' Sgt. Rick McCain said Friday.
   ``At this point in the investigation, we have found no evidence
of a kidnapping,'' he said.
   Sims, 37, was questioned for six hours Thursday night at Alton
police headquarters after an autopsy confirmed that an infant found
in a trash barrel in Missouri was Heather.
   Mrs. Sims was questioned for a few minutes, McCain said.
   The parents had never been ruled out as suspects, McCain said,
because of the similarities between Heather's disappearance and the
disappearance of their firstborn daughter, Loralei, in 1986.
   Their son was taken by the Illinois Department of Children and
Family Services, a decision ``based upon information that we
received last night that Randy Sims might be in jeopardy,'' he said.
   The case has dominated conversation in this town of 40,000,
across the Mississippi River from St. Louis.
   McCain said investigators have found no evidence to support the
Simses' claim that a masked gunman knocked out Mrs. Sims and
abducted the child late last Saturday _ a near duplication of their
report of Loralei's disappearance in 1986.
   No charges were filed in that case, which remains unsolved.
   A fisherman found Heather's body Wednesday night. It was wrapped
in a black plastic bag and placed in a trash barrel at a West
Alton, Mo., recreation area along the Mississippi River.
   The baby died of asphyxiation, McCain said. The autopsy revealed
she was killed about the time she was reported missing by her
parents.
   Police searched the couple's home Thursday and collected hair
and various fibers for laboratory analysis, McCain said.
   Black plastic bags _ similar to one in which the infant's body
was found _ were confiscated and sent to the FBI crime lab in
Washington.
   The couple told police that a masked gunman had approached Mrs.
Sims while she was taking out trash, forced her back into the home,
knocked her unconscious and took the infant. Sims said he was at
work at the time.
   In June 1986, the Simses, who then lived in nearby Brighton,
reported to authorities that an armed intruder barged into their
home while Sims was at work and took their 13-day-old firstborn.
   Remains believed to be Loralei's were discovered a week later
near the couple's home. No one was charged.

<HEAD>Linares Family Couldn't Have Paid Medical Bills Anyway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who disconnected his comatose son from life
support equipment wasn't motivated by the mounting medical costs
because the family couldn't have paid the bills anyway, an attorney
said.
   ``The man is indigent,'' Kevin Smith said of his client, Rudolfo
Linares. ``The man doesn't have the means to pay anyway, so there
is no financial motivation at all in Mr. Linares' action.''
   The Chicago Tribune had reported Friday that Linares, who is
charged with murder, unhooked his 16-month-old son from the
breathing apparatus just four days before the state was set to cut
off medical benefits that had covered more than $100,000 in medical
costs for the child.
   Smith said a cutoff of public aid would not have significantly
increased the family's already overwhelming financial burden,
adding that the hospital had picked up about $500,000 worth of
bills that were uncovered by the state and which the family was
unable to pay.
   On April 26, Linares pulled out a gun in his son's hospital room
and kept hospital staff and police at bay while Samuel, died in his
arms. When the boy was dead, the tearful Linares handed over the
gun and the child's body.
   Linares, 23, is free on bond.
   In another development, Cook County medical examiner Robert
Stein ruled the manner of Samuel Linares' death ``undetermined,''
saying Friday he needs to research hospital records before making a
final decision.
   ``I've never come across a case where if the medical examiner
did not determine there was a homicide, you could come up with
murder,'' Smith said.
   On a section of the boy's death certificate, Stein declared the
immediate cause of Samuel's death to be a lack of oxygen to the
brain caused by the boy's choking on a balloon last summer.
   It was that Aug. 2, 1988, accident that sent the boy into the
irreversible coma.

<HEAD>Freedom Made Permanent for Man `Wrongfully Accused' in '67 Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARCADIA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special prosecutor made freedom permanent
for a man who served 21 years in the poisoning deaths of his
children, and the longtime inmate said he planned to celebrate in
the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``I want to take a swim and admire myself in the water,'' James
J. Richardson said in a telephone interview from Fort Walton Beach.
``I'll go deep down in the water. I will wade in it to be baptized
again and refresh my life.''
   Prosecutor Janet Reno said Friday that she found reasonable
doubt that Richardson killed his children and indicated he probably
was wrongfully accused. She said the state would not put him on
trial again.
   Richardson described the decision as ``splendid.''
   ``She's doing her job,'' he said. ``She's doing it like it
should be done. It should have been done 21 years ago.''
   The 53-year-old former orange picker was released from prison
April 25 after retired Circuit Judge Clifton Kelly accepted Ms.
Reno's recommendation that his 1968 trial was unfair.
   Ms. Reno, the Dade County state attorney appointed by Gov. Bob
Martinez as a special prosecutor, found evidence of substantial
trial errors and perjured testimony. Attorneys for Richardson
contended he was framed.
   ``It is apparent after a review of all evidence obtained in the
original investigation and the ensuing investigation that not only
could the state not prove that James Richardson was guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt (but) that James Richarson was probably wrongfully
accused,'' she wrote.
   She also faulted the murder investigation as ``totally
inadequate and incomplete.''
   ``Obvious leads were never pursued, critical questions were
never answered, glaring inconsistencies were never resolved,
standard investigative procedures were never followed,'' she said.
``The only evidence linking Richardson with the crime is the
testimony of three jailhouse inmates which we find totally
unreliable.''
   Frank Schaub, who prosecuted the case in 1968 and retired in
January, lashed out at Ms. Reno and said there is still strong
evidence against Richardson.
   ``How about prosecuting her for dropping the case?'' Schaub
said. ``She's incompetent to prosecute. It's ridiculous. I don't
think they ever convict anybody down there (in Miami). They have
the most lawless community in the world.''
   But Ms. Reno said it would be impossible to reopen the case
because evidence has been lost or destroyed and some witnesses have
died or become incapacitated.
   Richardson orginally was jailed on charges of poisoning all
seven of his children to collect $14,000 in life insurance. But he
stood trial in 1968 only for the slaying of his oldest
stepdaughter, 8-year-old Betty Jean.
   The children, ages 2 to 8, died after eating a meal of hog
jowls, rice, peas and grits tainted with the pesticide parathion
Oct. 25, 1967.
   Sworn affidavits have implicated the family's baby sitter, but
Kelly said the killer ``will quite likely never be known.''
   Ms. Reno said she was probing whether anyone involved in the
investigation could be charged with criminal misdeeds, but she
noted that the statute of limitations could hinder any prosecution.
   Richardson was sentenced to death after his conviction, but the
sentences was commuted to life in prison when the U.S. Supreme
Court struck down the death penalty in 1972.
   Richardson has entered a diet clinic run by former comedian Dick
Gregory in Fort Walton Beach. He said his celebration also would
include trips to Chicago and to the grocery store.
   ``I'm looking to get a pineapple upside-down cake. What I can't
eat I'm going to rub in my face,'' he said.

   Alfred Puglisi thought it strange to
receive a Christmas Card in May _ and stranger still that it was
from Christmas 1978.
   Puglisi received a Christmas card on Monday that was originally
mailed from Hallendale, Fla., in December 1978, according to the
earliest postmark.
   The envelope bore six different postmarks _ four from December
1978, one from January 1979 and one from last month. The postmarks
indicated the card made a few round trips between Florida and New
York during the past decade, Puglisi said.
   Post office officials in both Amsterdam and Hallendale said they
didn't know why the card lay dormant for so long.
   Puglisi said the card was from an old friend, Evelyn McCauley.
   ``I thought it was a birthday card, because (McCauley) knew when
my birthday was,'' Puglisi said. ``But ... I opened it and found
out it was a Christmas card with a note enclosed.''

   No one should go hungry at next weekend's
colossal cookout in this city along the Ohio River.
   Some 40,000 to 50,000 people are expected to attend the 11th
Annual International Barbecue Festival, where an estimated 40,000
pounds of mutton and 5,000 chickens will be barbecued over grills.
   The festival is listed among the ``Top 100 Events in North
America for 1989'' by the American Tour Bus Association. It begins
Friday and attracts barbecue lovers from across the country and
from Canada.
   An International Classic Cook-off Competition to be held at noon
Saturday is open to anyone who sets up to cook over a charcoal spit
or grill. But the weekend's competitions aren't just over recipes.
   A new event this year is the Little Miss and Mr. Mutton Contest,
open to children 4 to 6 years old. Organizers hope 20 to 30 couples
will enter the contest; the winners will receive trophies and serve
as official representatives of the festival.

   Even for veteran roller coaster riders
like John and Angela Biacofsky, the Magnum XL-200 wowed them like
no other.
   The ride at the Cedar Point amusement park is billed by its
promoters as the world's highest and faster roller coaster, a claim
several other amusement parks have used in recent years.
   The Biacofskys and about 150 other members of the American
Coaster Enthusiasts organization rode Magnum XL-200 on Friday for
their impressions.
   They called it the ride of their lives.
   ``It felt like you were dropping out of a parachute,'' Mrs.
Biacofsky of Willoughby said about the Magnum's first hill. ``You
went straight down. It's the most amazing roller coaster I've ever
been on. You just can't believe it.''
   ``Awesome,'' said Biacofsky.
   The coaster's speed on its first, 201-foot-high hill is 70 to 75
mph. It includes 5,106 feet of track and three tunnels with smoke
machines.
   The public can test it today, as the park opens for the season.

   A 4{-foot kingsnake managed to get into
a house and made such a mess that the house's owner thought a
burglar had ransacked the property, officials said.
   The snake on Thursday knocked over tables and other furniture in
the den while seeking an escape route. When the owner returned to
his home, he thought he had been robbed ``until he found a snake
track leading to the fireplace,'' said Animal Control Officer Diana
Marcantel.
   Marcantel and another officer captured the reptile under a sofa
following a 10-minute, furniture-moving scramble. The non-poisonous
snake was released in an uninhabited area.
   The homeowner, who was not identified, noticed the snake sunning
on his roof earlier in the week. Kingsnakes don't like water, and
recent rains may have caused it to seek refuge in the attic before
it got into the den, Marcantel said.

<HEAD>Testimony Links Speaker to Political Action Committee Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former savings and loan executive has testified
that House Speaker Jim Wright offered to block legislation that
could hurt thrifts in exchange for $250,000 in contributions to a
political action committee.
   David R. Farmer was testifying Friday in the trial of three
former savings and loan executives on charges that they allegedly
participated in what federal prosecutors say was a conspiracy by
the thrifts to evade federal laws by channeling corporate
contributions to political campaigns.
   Wright was not named in the federal indictment against the three
defendants, Robert Hopkins, Morton Hopkins and John Harrell, who
were charged after investigations by the Dallas Bank Fraud Task
Force.
   The three are former executives of Commodore Savings Association.
   Farmer, former senior vice president and chief financial officer
of Commodore, said he gave a $1,000 donation to the East Texas
First Political Action Committee in 1985, then was told to file a
false expense report to get the money back.
   Farmer said it was understood that Wright, the Democratic
majority leader at the time, had guaranteed that specific
legislation unfavorable to savings and loans would be blocked from
making it out of committee. The former Commodore executive did not
cite the legislation.
   ``In return for the contributions, Jim Wright guaranteed the
legislation would not get out of committee,'' Farmer said. ``Both
John (Harrell) and myself were amazed that as high ranking an
individual in the Congress as he (Wright) would be involved in
something like this.''
   Under questioning, Farmer said 10 savings and loans were
contributing a total of $250,000 to the political fund.
   In other testimony this week, witnesses said Commodore employees
gave donations to a political action committee and were given
raises in return.
   A Commodore secretary testified that some of the money donated
to the political action committee was laundered through Vernon
Savings and Loan. On one check the words ``For Jim Wright'' were
written on the memo line, she said.
   Calls from The Associated Press to Wright's Washington and Fort
Worth, Texas, offices went unanswered late Friday night. Wright
spoke in his hometown of Fort Worth Friday to the Tarrant County
Bar Association and the Fort Worth Rotary Club.
   The allegations against Wright in the federal trial came as the
speaker's business transactions have been under fire by the House
ethics committee.

<TEXT>
   Residents of this tiny town were shaken but
no one was injured when an Air Force F-16 jet accidentally dropped
a 500-pound bomb during a training exercise.
   The device contained about 200 pounds of explosives and was ``as
real as we'd go to war with,'' said Col. James Moseby, deputy
commander for operations at Moody Air Force Base at Valdosta, where
the fighter is based.
   Bobby Foster, 53, a propane gas deliverer, said he was resting
on his sofa when he heard an explosion on Thursday.
   ``I thought it was an earthquake. It knocked pictures off my
wall. I ran to the door and saw smoke,'' he said.
   Foster said military planes often fly low over his home, and he
had been concerned that one day a bomb might fall.
   ``If the bomb had fallen a second later, it would have been up
there and I wouldn't be here today,'' Foster said, gesturing toward
his mobile home about one-quarter mile from the bomb site.
   The blast occurred while four armed jets were participating in a
bombing exercise at Fort Benning near Columbus, officials said.
   The pilot, who was not identified, had tried to drop the bomb
over Fort Benning's Kilo Impact Area during the exercise, but the
bomb did not release. About 3:15 p.m., when the plane was circling
back to the base for another attempt to release the bomb, it
accidentally fell, said Moseby.
   The bomb hit a pine tree and exploded about 40 feet above the
ground in a remote area near Brantley, a west Georgia community of
about 80 people. Trees within 100 yards of the explosion were cut
and scarred, but there was no impact on the ground.
   The Air Force and the Army are investigating the accident,
Moseby said, adding that the plane has been grounded. As part of
the investigation, he said, the jet will be taken apart and
examined.
   ``I don't see any pilot error that made it come off,'' he said.
   Moseby said the bombing exercises are part of Moody's regular
training program and are conducted in ``choreographed'' situations
at Benning. The planes avoid flying over areas with structures on
the ground, he added.
   He said the Air Force's track record is good.
   The bombs ``are pretty stable,'' Moseby said. ``We don't strap
bombs on the bottoms of airplanes that are just going to blow up.
This is one of those incidents that lowers (the guarantee of
safety) from 99.9999 percent to 99.999.''
   Moseby said he did not know how fast the jet was traveling, but
normally a plane on such a mission would be going about 375 mph.
   It was not the first time an F-16 from Moody has been forced to
drop bombs in Georgia. Capt. Cindy Nelson, a spokeswoman for the
base, said that on Jan. 27 an F-16 dropped six bombs in Lanier
County as it prepared for an emergency landing at Moody.
   The bombs landed on Grand Bay Weapons Range, but exploded close
enough to some homes to blow windows out. She did not know the
sizes of those bombs.

   Chlorine gas that leaked from a
fertilizer company's tanker truck enveloped parts of a densely
populated suburb and nearby bus station, injuring more than 200
people, police said today.
   The gas spewed Friday night for two hours from one of five
chlorine drums carried by the tanker, said a police official who
cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   The driver and his companion, apparently overwhelmed by the
fumes, abandoned the tanker near a bus station, The Times of London

English-language newspaper said today.
   Police said 207 people were admitted to six hospitals, and that
151 of them were discharged today.
   Many of the victims, who reported irritation in the eyes, nose
and throat, had fainted but were ``out of danger now,'' said M.P.
Khare, a physician who heads a government hospital where 77 people
were admitted.
   The Times of India newspaper quoted the engineers of the company
_ Shriram Foods and Fertilizers Industries _ as saying the leak was
caused by a faulty safety valve of the one-ton-capacity drum.
   Officials of the company were not available for comment.

<HEAD>Emperor Selassie's Son Announces Ascension to Throne</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His throne was a simple chair, his robes a blue
suit and his palace a London apartment.
   Fourteen years after his father's death, Haile Selassie's exiled
73-year-old son announced at a news conference Friday his ascension
to the Imperial Throne of Ethiopia, where a Marxist-led government
now rules.
   Seated beside his white-robed empress and surrounded by
family-in-exile, Ahma Selassie I of Ethiopia, the Conquering Lion
of the Tribe of Judah, indicated they believe the government will
not last long and that he will return to reign as a constitutional
monarch and bring democracy to the nation.
   Ahma Selassie's government-in-exile, however, has not been
recognized by foreign states, only by about 100 Ethiopian state
kings.
   The East African nation of 43 million inhabitants is one of the
world's poorest countries. It is torn by civil war and periodically
swept by famine.
   Haile Selassie became emperor in 1930. He pleaded unsuccessfully
to the now defunct League of Nations against the 1935-36 conquest
of his country by Italy. He was in England until his rule was
restored in 1941.
   He ruled Ethiopia for a total of 44 years as head of one of the
world's last feudal states. But on Sept. 12, 1974, he was deposed
by a military clique that established a Marxist government led by
Lt. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam and backed by the Soviet Union.
   Haile Selassie, who had made Ethiopia the United States'
strongest ally in Africa, was last seen alive climbing into the
back seat of a car outside his main palace in the capital Addis
Ababa.
   He died 11 months later in detention under obscure circumstances
at age 83.
   At the time his father was deposed, the younger Selassie had
been living in London for two years undergoing treatment for
diabetes.
   Seife Michael Zewde, son-in-law of Ahma Selassie and Privy
Councilor to the throne, said 3 million Ethiopians are in exile,
the army has suffered defections ``en masse'' and Mengistu's
government is spending nearly 80 percent of its budget on the
military.
   Asked when Ahma Selassie might return, Empress Medferiash Work
said: ``Since the Ethiopian people are fed up to the teeth with
being oppressed and murdered at random, then the will of God should
be the decider _ soon.''
   Zewde said Ahma Selassie was asked to take the throne by about
100 Ethiopian state kings and 62 locally elected officials.
   The emperor has refused to hold any coronation outside Ethopian
soil, so he has postponed it until he gains power, said Zewde, who
acted as translator.
   The ``United Ethiopian Patriots Solidarity Armed Forces,'' or
military arm of the locally elected council, is fighting the
government, Zewde said. ``In all the countryside they are dying by
the hundreds,'' he said.
   Other rebel groups fighting the Marxist government for
independence in Eritrea and Tigre provinces have been in existence
since before Selassie's ouster.

   Police guarded polling places and
helicopters delivered ballots to remote mountain and jungle areas
as Bolivians prepared to vote for president Sunday.
   No violence was reported as the electoral court late Friday
completed the nationwide distribution of ballots.
   More than 2 million Bolivians are expected to cast their votes
for 10 parties with candidates ranging from a former dictator to a
farming leader who was shot and crippled by another ex-dictator.
   Most polls place former dictator Gen. Hugo Banzer Suarez of the
rightist Nationalist Democratic Action as the front runner, with
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of the conservative Revolutionary
Nationalist Movement competing for second with the Social
Democratic Movement of the Revolutionary Left.
   President Victor Paz Estenssoro, 81, is retiring from politics.
   For a country once considered one of the most unstable in South
America, August will mark the seventh year of democratic rule. It
will also be the first transfer of power to a new government in 25
years by a president who has completed his term.
   Policeman were deployed Friday to schools throughout the country
where electoral boxes and ballots were distributed by electoral
officials. The distribution was handled without major delays,
including the use of helicopters to remote indian communities in
the Andean highlands and tropical lowlands.
   Political campaigning came to an end midnight Thursday and the
three leading candidates said that were confident they would win a
majority of votes Sunday.
   At the closing of his campaign Thursday, Banzer assured a large
crowd gathered in the semitropical city of Santa Cruz, 470 miles
east of La Paz, his victory with the support of ``men and woman who
desire economic stability that will assure their and their
children's future.''
   Banzer, 62, seized power in a 1971 coup that toppled a leftist
military dictatorship and ruled until 1978, when popular pressure
forced him to call elections. The Bolivian Rights Assembly says
during Banzer's government there were 72 deaths, 78 disappearences,
14,537 illegal detentions and 3,000 exiles.
   Sanchez Lozada, 58, a University of Chicago philosophy graduate,
promised to create 250,000 new jobs and 150,000 new dwellings. He
was planning minister under Estenssoro and one of the architects of
a stabilization program that lowered inflation from 24,000 percent
four years ago to 2 percent for the first quarter of this year.
   However, Bolivia's economy remains plagued by high unemployment
and continued low prices on tin, their primary export.
   For a candidate to win the presidency he must receive more than
50 percent of the votes. Since none of the candidates is expected
to receive more than 30 percent, the congress elected Sunday will
convene Aug. 4 to elect Bolivia's 77th president.
   The campaign began early this year and cost at least $10
million, a record for a country of 6 million where the minimum
monthly wage is $45.

<HEAD>Mass Arrests Made At Spearfishing Protest On Eve Of Regular Fishing

   More than 100 people were arrested
in the biggest protest yet over an Indian tribe's right to
spearfish in off-reservation water.
   Police estimated about 850 people gathered at Trout Lake as six
boatloads of spearers from the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa reservation
set out on a cold, snowy Friday evening.
   The crowd included about 100 to 150 supporters of the Indians,
police estimated. More than 150 officers were stationed at the boat
landing.
   Federal courts have ruled that tribal members retain the right
to spear walleyed pike and other game fish with spotlights during
spring spawning season, much as their forefathers did by torchlight.
   Spearfishing has generated emotional protests from non-Chippewa
who contend the treaty-reserved rights are discriminatory and
threaten fish populations. Protesters waving American flags and
chanting ``equal rights'' surged across a police line and sat down
at the boat landing. More than 105 were arrested by early today,
and they were hauled away in vans and a school bus.
   The protest began hours after U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb
refused to grant a state request to halt the spearing before sport
anglers open their season today.
   Tribal members have faced crowds of hundreds of protesters, some
shouting racial slurs and throwing rocks, since the spearing season
began April 23. There had been more than 100 arrests before Friday.
   This is the fifth year Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands have
speared walleye from northern Wisconsin lakes since a federal court
ruled the tribe retained the rights to hunt, fish and gather wild
grain under 19th century treaties that ceded land to the United
States.
   Tensions over the spring spearfishing have increased each year.
They have heightened this year after the state reduced the
sportfishing walleye catch limit on the 254 lakes the tribe has
targeted for spearing.

<HEAD>Security Sources Have No New Leads on Abducted Relief Worker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security sources in southern Lebanon said
today they had no new leads on the whereabouts of a West German
relief worker who was abducted two days ago.
   ``The whole case of Markus Michael is a mystery,'' said a source
at the Nasserite Sunni Moslem militia, which is in charge of
security in Sidon.
   There has been no claim of responsibility in Thursday's
incident, which is believed linked to the trial of a Lebanese
hijacker in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   The 25-year-old was kidnapped by five unidentified gunmen on
Sidon's southern edge along with two fellow relief workers from the
ASME-Humanitas agency, Heinrich Struebig and Petra Schnitzler.
   Struebig, 48, and Schnitzler, 26, were released Friday. They met
the Nasserite militia's leader Mustafa Saad in Sidon for 10
minutes, but refused to talk to the press. Struebig is an
administrator and Schnitzler a nurse.
   ``The released two haven't donated any significant information
about the captors or their motives,'' the source said. He refused
to be named.
   ``They only said they wanted to talk to their headquarters in
Germany and to their government. It seems they wanted to relay some
information to Germany,'' the source added.
   The West German Embassy refused comment on the case.
   In Bonn, West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Hans Schumacher
noted that Struebig and Schnitzler had disappeared for two days in
Lebanon under similar circumstances a year ago.
   He said he considered the latest 10-hour disappearance ``a bit
strange.''
   The three worked from a base between the Palestinian refugee
camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh on Sidon's eastern edge. The
Sidon region, 25 miles south of Beirut, is a PLO stronghold.
   Lt. Col. Wajih Abu Ali, commander of the PLO's military police
in the Sidon region and in charge of protecting the ASME-Humanitas
base, also said the two who were released have refused to cooperate
with investigators.
   ``They refused to give us any information about the kidnappers,
their demands, if any, and the place where they were held,'' Abu
Ali told reporters in Mieh Mieh. ``They only said they were
threatened.''
   On Friday, Abu Ali said Struebig and Schnitzler told him the
kidnappers have threatened to kill Michael if they divulged any
information about the abduction.
   The daily newspaper Al-Liwaa, which publishes in Moslem west
Beirut, said the captors wanted a ``lenient sentence'' for Mohammed
Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem terrorist held in Frankfurt.
It cited no source for the report.
   West German prosecutors have demanded a life sentence for Hamadi
for involvement in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner in which a
U.S. Navy diver was shot to death and his body tossed onto the
airport tarmac, two U.S. men were severely beaten and 37 other
passengers were held hostage 17 days.
   Abu Ali refused comment on the newspaper report, but a deputy
said Friday the two released told him the kidnapping was linked to
Hamadi.
   The source at the Nasserite militia said: ``I find it strange.
If the kidnappers want to pressure the Germans, then why did they
release two German hostages?''
   A verdict in Hamadi's case is expected within two weeks.
   Hamadi's elder brother, Abdul-Hadi, heads the security apparatus
for the Iranian-backed extremist group Hezbollah, or Party of God,
which is the umbrella organization for underground pro-Iranian
factions holding Western captives.
   In addition to Michael, there are 15 foreigners held in Lebanon
_ nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a
Belgian.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Denied permission to attend the hometown
prom, a high school student and his married date are getting
invitations to dance at proms across the country.
   Jayme Wessels, 17, wanted to take family friend Delores
Washburn, 35, to the Alburnett prom last weekend but the school
board denied permission, saying it was inappropriate for a student
to bring a date who was married.
   A judge upheld the school's decision, and they stayed home. But
word of their case spread around the country and invitations to
attend other proms are streaming in.
   ``I think they've had a dozen invitations from high school proms
across the country,'' said Mrs. Washburn's husband, Don.
   Wessels said a Jacksonville, Fla., radio station is trying to
line up a prom for them, and one Chicago station has arranged for
the couple to attend a prom May 12. Both have agreed to pay for the
couple's airplane trip.
   ``I'm real excited about it,'' said Wessels. He said, however, a
school landscaping project may force him to sit out the May 12 prom.

<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms today followed killer tornadoes over
portions of the Carolinas, dumping more than an inch of rain in an
hour, and flood watches were posted in the middle and northern
Atlantic coastal states.
   More than two dozen tornadoes touched down Friday evening in the
Carolinas. The hardest-hit area appeared to be in Spartanburg
County, S.C., where a tornado killed at least three people and
injured more than 30.
   In all, the storm was blamed for the deaths of at least 16
people since Thursday night. Four people died in North Carolina;
three in South Carolina; one in Louisiana; seven in Texas; and one
in Oklahoma.
   Thunderstorms produced baseball-sized hail and 60 mph winds in
Lexington County, S.C., where numerous trees and power lines were
reported down.
   Trailers were overturned in Farmington, N.C., and trees fell
onto mobile homes in Summerfield and Rockingham counties.
   A severe thunderstorm struck Baltimore, uprooting trees with
wind gusts to 78 mph.
   Richmond, Va., received more than an inch of rain in one hour
early this morning, while some central Virginia and western
Maryland towns reported up to 5 inches of rain from the storm.
   Parts of eastern Pennsylvania received 2 to 4 inches of rain. Up
to 2 inches fell in the Washington, D.C., area in the six hours
ending at 2 a.m. EDT.
   Rain and scattered thunderstorms spread northeast into nearly
all of New York and New England by early this morning. With the
ground saturated from recent rainfall, flooding was possible in
portions of the middle and northern Atlantic coastal states, from
Virginia to southern Maine.
   Light snow fell across much of Minnesota, Wisconsin and northern
Michigan early today.
   Unseasonable cold settled into the upper Mississippi Valley and
the northern and central Plains, setting records Friday for the
date in Minneapolis, with 26 degrees, and Rochester, Minn., also 26.
   The high for the nation Saturday was 107 degrees in Laughlin,
Nev., Bullhead City, Ariz., and Buckeye, Ariz.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from North
Carolina across the mid-Atlantic states to southern New England;
scattered showers and thunderstorms extending from Florida across
southeast Georgia to eastern South Carolina; rain across Maine and
New Hampshire; scattered rain from the lower Great Lakes to the
Ohio and Tennessee valleys; rain and snow showers scattered over
the upper Great Lakes; and sunny skies from the Plains to the
Plateau.
   Highs were to be in the 40s from eastern sections of Minnesota
and Iowa to much of the Great Lakes, with readings in the upper 30s
over Upper Michigan; in the 50s and 60s from the northern and
middle Atlantic coast states across the Ohio, Tennessee and middle
Mississippi valleys to the northern and central Plains; in the 90s
from the interior valleys of California across southern sections of
Arizona and New Mexico to far west Texas; and from 100 to 110 over
the desert Southwest. Elsewhere, highs mostly were to be in the 70s
and 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 20
degrees in Duluth, Minn., to 87 degrees in Phoenix and Glendale,
Ariz.

<HEAD>Ten Governors Urge DOE to Do Something About Radioactive Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten governors have urged Energy Secretary James D. Watkins to
set a national policy for cleaning up radioactive and hazardous
waste at the nation's nuclear defense plants within 30 years.
   ``The cleanup and disposal of ... defense wastes has been
deferred too long,'' the governors said in the cover letter to a
seven-page report they delivered to Watkins Friday.
   ``The defense waste problem is national in its scope and
severity,'' the letter said. ``Its resolution is a national
obligation. It must also be a national priority.''
   Each of the governors has a DOE research or defense facility in
his state. The proposal requests the setting of a firm timetable
for cleaning up all DOE sites within 30 years and creation of a
trust fund to guarantee adequate resources to complete the job.
   ``Without a firm schedule, there is no assurance that the
critical cleanup work will be completed in a timely manner _ if at
all,'' the report said. ``We feel that a commitment to clean up all
... facilities within 30 years is both essential and achievable.''
   The federal government has estimated defense waste cleanup will
cost between $110 billion and $130 billion over the next 50 years.
Less than $1 billion was authorized in the current federal budget,
mainly for waste management and temporary storage rather than
cleanup and permanent disposal.
   ``The competition for funds between production and cleanup
activities must end,'' the report said. ``Funding priorities for
cleanup must be driven by the risks posed by waste problems and not
the need to maintain production operations.''
   The paper was signed by Govs. Ned Ray McWherter of Tennessee,
Richard Celeste of Ohio, Booth Gardner of Washington, Cecil Andrus
of Idaho, Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, Garrey Carruthers of
New Mexico, Roy Romer of Colorado, Bob Miller of Nevada, Neil
Goldschmidt of Oregon and Wallace Wilkinson of Kentucky.

<HEAD>Two North Korean Defectors Say Olympics Showed Them Real Korea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two North Korean students who defected
in Poland said upon arrival today that only after viewing the Seoul
Olympics on television did they see they had been lied to by their
Communist government.
   ``We were taught to believe that North Korea is the best country
in the world to live in, but once in the outside world, we realized
that we had been deceived,'' said Kim Un Hwak at an airport news
conference.
   Kim and Dong Young Hoon, both 24, said they were surprised when
they saw television footage in Poland showing a developed South
Korea during last year's Summer Olympics.
   ``In North Korea, we had been taught to believe that South Korea
is shambles and a very poor country, but it was a lie,'' Dong said.
   Kim and Dong, who defected to the West late last month through a
European country, were escorted to South Korea by government
officials.
   The two said they were sorry for their families in North Korea,
but they were happy to be in South Korea, which they believe is
also ``part of our homeland.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Hoon said Dong had been
studying at Gdansk University and Kim at Warsaw Engineering College
when they sought political asylum at a South Korean embassy in a
Western European nation.
   Under an international convention, the South Korean embassy had
no power to grant asylum to the North Koreans, so authorities of
the European nation were asked to intervene, he said.
   The European nation involved asked not to be identified for now,
Hoon added.
   It was the second time this year that North Korean students in
East Europe had defected to South Korea through west Europe.
   On Feb. 9, two North Korean students _ Cho Sung Gun, 22, and Kim
Un Chul, 22 _ who had been studying in Czechoslovakia, defected to
South Korea.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
capitalist South Korea in 1945 at the end of World War II. The two
Koreas fought a bloody war from 1950-53.

<TEXT>
   Adnan Khairallah, the deputy commander in
chief of the armed forces and defense minister, was killed in a
helicopter crash during a sandstorm in northern Iraq, President
Saddam Hussein said today.
   Hussein said in a statement broadcast over state radio that the
50-year-old general, considered the second most powerful man after
Hussein in the tight-knit clan that rules Iraq, died Friday.
   Khairallah was both a cousin and brother-in-law to the Iraqi
leader.
   Khairallah was appointed defense minister in 1979, days after
Hussein assumed the presidency, and held the post throughout the
8-year Iran-Iraq conflict that ended in a cease-fire in August.
   The president described him as ``one of the distingushed war
heros and a sparkling star in Iraq's sky.''
   Hussein said Khairallah died instantly when the helicopter went
down en route to Baghdad from the northern mountain resort of
Sarsang near Mosul, which lies 280 miles northwest of Baghdad.
   He said everyone on board perished except for one person, but he
did not elaborate. The statement said two escorting helicopters
survived ``the crazy storm.'' The site of the crash was not
reported.
   The helicopter was believed to be one of the U.S.-manufactured
Bell helicopters used to whisk leaders around the country.
   The radio said Khairallah would be given a state funeral today
in Baghdad and buried in the city of Tikrit, the clan seat 115
miles north of the capital.
   Saddam said Khairallah was in the northern Kurdish region
inspecting army positions when he joined the president's family who
were touring the same area.
   The government has instituted a huge relocation program for the
rebellious minority, razing thousands of dwellings. The U.S. Senate
and a several Western human rights organizations have protested the
army assault on Kurdish areas last summer, accusing Iraq of using
poison gas. Iraq denied the charges.
   Khairallah was a member of the ruling Revolutionary Command
Council and the highest command of the Baath Party.
   Khairallah took part in the bloodless coup that toppled
President Abdul Rahaman Aref and brought the ruling Baath party to
power in 1968.
   Khairallah was married to the daughter of ex-president Ahmed
Hassan Al-Bakr, who resigned in 1979. He has three children.

   Six teen-agers charged with beating and raping a
woman jogger have been indicted in an attack on another runner
during the same rampage through Central Park.
   The six, plus another two teens, were charged Friday with
attacking David Lewis, 30, who was struck and injured while running
around the Central Park reservoir, District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau said Friday.
   The same six, plus one of the two others, also were accused of
assaulting another jogger, John Loughlin, 40. He told police a gang
beat him unconscious and stole his portable radio.
   Both alleged attacks occurred on the same night as the woman was
chased from a jogging trail, beaten, raped and left for a dead in a
mud puddle.
   The 28-year-old woman broke a 106-degree fever Friday and
appeared to be making some neurological progress after coming out
of a 2{-week coma on Tuesday, a doctor said.
   She was resting comfortably but tired easily, had a short
attention span and was disoriented, doctors at Metropolitan
Hospital said.
   All the indicted youths were part of a larger group of as many
as 30 who entered the park around 9 p.m. on April 19 and attacked
people at random, Morgenthau said.

   Developers have unearthed portions of an old
cemetery that an amateur historian says could contain the remains
of 38,000 people, including victims of the 1871 Chicago fire.
   The 20-acre site was once the location of the Cook County poor
house and a state mental hospital, said Barry Fleig, who is writing
a guidebook to Chicago cemeteries.
   Fleig said he can document the burial of 17,000 bodies there
from 1851 through 1912, and said the site could contain the remains
of as many as 38,000 people.
   Developers of a housing complex unearthed the site and must have
the bones reburied before building can continue, a city health
official ruled Friday.
   ``There's no specific health or disease problem at this point;
it's basically just respect for the dead,'' said Roger Cieslik, a
health department supervisory.

<DATELINE>CANCUN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commercial plane carrying up to 17 U.S.
tourists crashed in the jungles of Yucatan Peninsula after an
engine failed but officials said no one was killed.
   Diego Acosta, commander of the Red Cross in Cancun, said army
troops in radio contact with the pilot of the Aerocozumel flight
early today said there were injuries. He said he had no details on
the seriousness of the injuries.
   The three-engine, British-made Trislander, flying from the
archeological site of Chichen Itza to the island resort of Cozumel
crashed about two miles outside the Playa del Carmen airport, 25
miles south of Cancun.
   The Excelsior news agency said the aircraft, which was filled to
capacity and had one pilot, was able to land despite having lost
power in one of its engines. It said all passengers were believed
to be American.
   ``The problem is that the people (passengers) have not come out
because it is impossible because of the number of trees. From the
edge of the road it's about three miles to where the plane is,''
Acosta said.
   While the jungle terrain hampered rescue operations, authorities
managed to air-drop food and medicine.
   Cmdr. Agustin Ortega Martin del Campo, army commander for the
region about 900 miles east of Mexico City, said a helicopter had
circled the site but was unable to land because of the jungle
growth.
   Speaking by telephone from Cancun, he said about 30 Mexican
soldiers were going overland to the site but were slowed by the
jungle terrain and lack of nearby roads.

   Sikh separatists stormed into a bank in this
northern city today and sprayed the lobby with gunfire, killing two
customers and seriously wounding two employees, police said.
   ``They never wanted to loot the bank, they just wanted to
kill,'' said Kapoor Singh, a Sikh bank employee who was
hospitalized after sustaining bullet injuries in the shoulder and
back during the attack.
   Four young turbaned Sikhs came on two motorscooters and barged
into the government-owned bank minutes after it opened, said Police
Chief Shoeb Ali.
   After the shooting, which lasted about two minutes, the
attackers fled on their scooters, Ali said.
   He said the attackers were anti-government Sikh extremists who
are fighting to set up a Sikh nation in the neighboring state of
Punjab. Jammu, the capital of Jammu and Kashmir state, is 45 miles
north of the Punjab border.
   Sikh militants have killed at least 630 people this year in
Punjab, a rich farming state, in their quest for the separate
homeland.
   Separatists among the Sikh community, which forms 2 percent of
India's 880 million population, say they are discriminated by the
Hindu majority.
   The 7-year-old separatist campaign has been largely confined to
Punjab, but the extremists have sometimes attacked and killed
people in Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir and Rajasthan states that
surround Punjab.

   Beijing University students, the last holdouts in
a two-week boycott of classes, voted today to continue their strike
and press the government for democratic reforms.
   Student activists at the university, China's most prestigious,
said they would try to rekindle the boycott at other schools, where
classes began returning to normal Friday.
   Meanwhile, a newly formed student group representing at least 24
universities sent an appeal today to the government for talks on
democratic reform and an end to corruption.
   The two-page appeal was sent two days after Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang made a conciliatory call for talks.
   The statement called for ``sincere, construction and open
talks'' and ``requested'' they be open to the media. The students
said they would return to government offices Monday to hear the
response of the leadership, which has insisted talks must be
conducted through officially established student unions.
   The new group, called the Student Dialogue Representative group,
was formed after the government refused to meet with the
independent student union that has organized three weeks of
protests, including several mass demonstrations.
   The protests have been the largest in 40 years of communist rule.
   Shen Tong, general secretary of the new group, said its goals
were the same as the United Association of Beijing Universities, an
umbrella group linking independent student unions on more than 40
city campuses.
   The new group includes representatives from Beijing University,
where students overwhelmingly voted to continue a class boycott
that began April 24.
   ``If we persist a while longer, some of our demands will be
realized. If we don't, all of our efforts will be wasted,'' one
Beijing University student shouted through a loudspeaker as several
hundred classmates gathered on campus.
   Each dormitory room, which sleep six to eight people, received a
vote, and the final tally was 865 rooms to 303 in favor of the
boycott, with more than 100 rooms abstaining, student leaders said.
The vote in support of the independent union, which conducted the
election, was 871-153 rooms.
   Some students were angry over reports of authorities at one
school threatening activists with expulsion and of tactics by
officials at the Beijing College of Aeronautics.
   Officials there cut off electricity on campus for four days in
an effort to discourage the students from joining protests, peeled
off student protest posters and locked the campus gates so students
could not take part in Thursday's march.
   Zhao and Premier Li Peng indicated after the march that the
government planned talks with the students. They gave no specifics,
however.
   Zhao's statements on the student movement were the most
conciliatory yet by any government leader and included an
acknowledgement that the protesters were correct in demanding
``that we fix maladies in our work.''
   But one Beijing University activist dismissed Zhao's speech as
lacking ``substantial content.'' ``It's just talk,'' he said.
   The state press today hailed the return to classes of most of
the students. But several acknowleged that students were not
satisfied with Zhao's speech and believed he underestimated the
extent of corruption.
   A railway worker who took part in violence triggered by an April
22 student march in Xian was convicted of arson and theft and
sentenced to death, the Legal Daily reported. Zhang Jun was on
trial with more than 900 other people accused of attacking
government offices in the northwestern tourist city after a student
march.
   The report said Zhang set several vehicles on fire, stole small
items from inside them and threw rocks and bricks through
government office windows and at police. About 130 security forces
were injured in the violence, but no deaths were reported.

   Fifteen tons of confiscated fireworks blew up
inside a downtown Mexico City fire station, injuring at least 39
people and shattering windows for blocks, officials said.
   ``We were sitting here, joking and watching the men play
volleyball, when everything suddenly went red and orange,'' said
1st Commander L. de Muro as workers swept up spent fireworks inside
the station garage.
   ``Most of the men ran out of the cloud. Those who were near the
fireworks couldn't. Two men were on fire,'' he said.
   The blast, at about 5:55 p.m. Friday, shattered windows three
blocks away, sent up a towering plume of white smoke and showered
streets with broken glass.
   Fire official Roberto Jaime Rangel said 15 tons of fireworks
were stored outside at the fire station and that the explosion was
caused by ``overheating.'' A Federal District criminal investigator
said the cause was being investigated.
   Fire Chief I. Ponce de Leon said the fireworks had been seized
in various nearby markets and stored at the station for about six
weeks.
   He said the majority of the firefighters injured were working in
the garage area when the explosion occurred.
   Dr. Carlos Esperanza Garcia, doctor in charge at the nearby
Hospital Ruben Lenero, said five people were taken there suffering
from burns.
   The Red Cross said eight firemen and one civilian, two of them
in serious condition, were taken to hospitals by Red cross
ambulances.
   Saul Escobedo Ramirez, chief of ambulances at the police rescue
service, said their ambulances picked up 30 injured, 23 of them
firemen and seven civilians.
   The state-run Notimex news agency quoted the attorney general's
office as saying that 49 people were injured.
   On Dec. 11, 1988, 62 people were killed in a Mexico City
marketplace when tons of illegal fireworks exploded. That disaster
was followed by a crackdown on fireworks vendors.
   The fire station is three blocks from that market.

   JERUSALEM _ Israeli soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians
and wounded 91 today in fierce clashes that occurred as Moslems
celebrated the end of the holy month of Ramadan, Arab reports said.
   An Israeli army spokesman confirmed two dead and 20 wounded.
   The two deaths raise to 463 the number of Palestinians killed
since the beginning of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation in December 1987. Twenty Israelis have also died.
   The bloodiest clashes today were reported in the Gaza Strip's
Nusseirat refugee camp, where the two Palestinains died and 39 were
wounded, Arab reports said. The confrontations occurred as
worshipers were leaving a mosque to pray at the graves of
Palestinians killed by Israeli troops, the reports said.
   Today is the first day of Eid al-Fitr, a Moslem holiday that
ends the month of daytime fasting called Ramadam. It is
traditionally celebrated with morning prayers followed by visits to
cemeteries to remember dead relatives.
   The Palestinians began chanting ``God Is Great'' and throwing
stones when they saw 20 jeeps carrying paramilitary border police
and the elite Givati infantry brigade waiting near the mosque,
according to Arab reports.
   The soldiers fired tear gas, rubber bullets and later live
ammunition at the demonstrators, killing Muhammad Abdalla Zakout,
40, and Muhammad Muenes, 20, of Nusseirat, who were both shot in
the head, the reports said. The wounded included an 11-year-old boy
who was shot in the stomach and an 18-year-old in critical
condition who was shot in the chest.
   The army clamped a curfew on the camp shortly after the
confrontation, confining the area's 29,000 residents to their homes.
   United Nations Relief and Works Agency clinics in the Gaza Strip
reported two dead and 56 wounded, but spokeswoman Claire Grimes
said they were receiving additional reports of shootings.
   United Nations Clinics in the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis,
reported 28 wounded, two in critical condition, Grimes said.
   In the town of Beit Hanoun, also in Gaza, eight Arabs were shot
and wounded in clashes with troops, including a 12-year-old boy.
   In the Bureij refugee camp 10 Palestinians were reportedly shot.
   Clashes were also reported in the Mugazi and Jebaliya refugee
camp where four Palestinians were wounded.
   Throughout Gaza, Palestinian activists used mosque loudspeakers
to urge residents to donate blood at hospitals or local clinics,
Arab reports said.
   In the occupied West Bank, two Palestiinans were shot, including
an 8-year-old boy from the Tulkarem refugee camp, who was shot in
the chest.

<HEAD>Shelling Continues In Lebanon As Cease-Fire Monitors Deployed</HEAD>

   Moslem forces shelled the coast of the
Christian heartland north of Beirut today as the Arab League
struggled to deploy an observer force to monitor a widely ignored
truce.
   Police said artillery and rocket salvos fired sporadically from
Syrian-controlled west Beirut landed at the shoreline between the
ports of Jounieh and Byblos. Christian army units did not return
fire.
   No casualties were reported. At least 278 people have been
killed and 1,010 wounded since the current round in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war began March 8, pitting Christians against an
alliance of Syrian and Druse forces.
   A police spokesman said the shelling kept the only escape routes
closed for the 1 million Christians in the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave.
   Two Cypriot-flagged ferry boats that occasionally have been
running the gantlet of Syrian fire to transport Christians from
Jounieh and Byblos to Larnaca, Cyprus, suspended their shuttles
again Thursday.
   Druse and leftist Moslems allied with Syria have declared they
will stop the coastal shelling only when the observer force from
six Arab nations is in place along Beirut's dividing Green Line and
neighboring hills.
   They also have demanded that Arab observers be stationed in
Jounieh and Byblos to determine whether new supplies of Iraqi arms
are received by the mainly Christian troops of the army commander,
Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe, expressed support for Aoun when he
declared in March his ``war of liberation'' against Syria, which
maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Aoun, who has agreed to lift his military blockade of illegal
harbors run by Moslem militias south of Beirut, has denied
receiving any arms from Iraq.
   The blockade Aoun began March 6 ignited the current fighting.
Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party militia
retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave. The Syrians later
joined the shelling and closed the enclave's land exits.
   The Lebanese media said the Kuwaiti commander of the 321-man
observer force, Brig. Gen. Ali Momen, was due in Damascus on Sunday
for talks with Syrian government leaders before coming to Beirut to
take up his post.
   Contingents of the force contributed by Kuwait, Tunisia,
Algeria, Jordan, Sudan and North Yemen are expected to be airlifted
to Beirut late next week, according to media reports.
   The Arab League's Council of Foreign Ministers decided to form
the force last month in a bid to halt the current fighting.
   The council also called a cease-fire April 28. But it had since
been violated daily by sporadic shelling of the Christian enclave's
coast.

   Thousands of blacks and whites
thronged to a cathedral today for the funeral of assassinated white
activist David Webster, then followed his coffin in one of the
largest anti-apartheid marches of the 3-year-old state of emergency.
   Mourners jogging behind the hearse and packed into buses gave
clenched fist salutes to passersby and chanted the initials of the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement as they
headed through central Johannesburg toward a cemetery six miles
away in a whites-only suburb.
   Webster, 44, was killed outside his home Monday by a man firing
a shotgun at close range from a passing car. Police have issued
sketches of three unidentified white men suspected in the killing,
which provoked grief and outrage throughout the anti-apartheid
movement.
   Webster, a professor of anthropology, was one of the few senior
white members of the predominantly black United Democratic Front, a
nationwide anti-apartheid coalition.
   He was a prominent critic of the government's policy of
detention without trial and had researched the numerous unsolved
killings and abductions of anti-apartheid activists that have
occurred over the past decade.
   ``He helped us (blacks) realize there are white people who are
human beings,'' said the Rev. Frank Chikane, a black church leader,
at the three-hour funeral service. ``His life should be a message
to all white South Africans to rediscover the humanity that could
make this country free.''
   About 2,000 people filled St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral for the
funeral, while hundreds more stood outside, singing freedom songs
during the service.
   Eulogies for Webster were interspersed with performances by
white and black singers and a black jazz group. The mourners
included diplomats from more than a dozen Western countries, human
rights activists from across South Africa, residents of a remote
Zulu community where Webster conducted research, and fellow
supporters of a Soweto soccer team, the Orlando Pirates.
   The crowd included Raymond Suttner, another white,
anti-apartheid academic who was released last year after more than
two years in detention, and Johnny Clegg, South Africa's most
successful pop music star, who flew back from a tour in the United
States to pay tribute to a man whom he credited for helping to
inspire his Zulu-style rock 'n' roll.
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, secretary-general of the United Democratic
Front, described Webster as ``a gallant soldier whose determination
to fight apartheid was more important than his life.''
   He said Webster's work in support of detainees over the past
three years, a period when about 30,000 activists have been held
for varying times without charge, ``denied the government the
ability to break our spirits.''
   ``It is widely suspected that the assassin is a member of the
police force ... maybe on duty outside this cathedral,'' Valli
Moosa said.
   Helen Joseph, an 84-year-old white activist the South African
media are not allowed to quote, said: ``The guilt for David's death
lies squarely on the shoulders of the National Party government.''
   Hundreds of policemen, including some in helicopters, were
deployed to monitor the funeral and the route along which 5,000
marchers and bus-riders traveled to West Park Cemetary.
   Anti-government parades are not allowed in South Africa, and
police have restricted most funerals of slain activists, placing
limits on the number of mourners, the content of speeches, and size
of the funeral procession.
   But at Webster's funeral, policemen watched impassively as
hundreds of black youths marched and drove past chanting in support
of the African National Congress.

<HEAD>Cardenas Marks Birth of New Leftist Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Mexicans converged on
Mexico City's Zocalo plaza to mark the birth of a new leftist
political party headed by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, runner-up in July's
presidential election.
   ``The existence of the Revolutionary Democratic Party gives the
people a real alternative _ that of democratic change,'' he told
the crowd Friday.
   Cardenas, candidate of the National Democratic Front coalition,
finished second in the July 6 presidential vote to Carlos Salinas
de Gortari of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has
governed Mexico for 60 years.
   Supporters of Cardenas allege widespread fraud gave the victory
to Salinas, whose 50 percent total was the lowest ever for a
governing party candidate.
   Cardenas said the new political party would ``fight for the
restoration of national sovereignty, the rule of law and eradicate
corruption.'' He called for a suspension of payments on Mexico's
$107 billion foreign debt that, he said, ``leave Mexicans with
hunger salaries.''
   ``The real debt is with the Mexican people,'' Cardenas declared,
calling for wage increases for workers and higher guaranteed prices
for peasant crops.
   The leftist leader also said the new party would advocate an
expansion of Mexico's relations with other Latin American countries
and stress economic development independent of the United States.
   ``Mexico must never join multinational organizations with the
United States, as has been the case under the silent integration
policy of the government since 1982,'' he declared. That year
generally is considered the start of Mexico's foreign trade
liberalization, applauded by U.S. leaders.
   Cardenas also vowed to fight for fraud-free local and national
elections.
   ``Even if in July we were defrauded of victory ... we will
continue to work constitutionally to achieve our goals,'' he
declared.
   Cardenas said the new party obtained enough signatures during a
voter registration drive to file with the government for formal
political party status. To register a political party Mexican law
requires 65,000 signatures plus at least 100 signatures in each of
the country's 300 election districts.

   A magistrate today filed murder
charges against a hard-line separatist in the slaying of two senior
leaders of the independence movement in this French Pacific
territory.
   Andre Tangopi was charged in the shooting deaths of Jean-Marie
Tjibaou, leader of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front,
and his top assistant, Yeiwene Yeiwene. Police did not say what
role Tangopi played in the attack.
   He was wounded in an exchange of gunfire that followed the
assassination and was under police guard in the hospital at Noumea,
the provincial capital.
   The two leaders were shot and killed Thursday by Djubelly Wea,
who, like Tangopi, opposed Tjibaou's moderate policies. Wea was
killed by Tjibaou's bodyguards after the attack, which occurred on
the island of Ouvea.
   Police today released two other suspects in the killings: Paoula
Wea, a nephew of Wea, and Fessen Tuet, a statement from the
prosecutors office said.
   Elections planned for June 11 were postponed after the killings,
and they have not been rescheduled, French Premier Michel Rocard
has said. Rocard was to attend Tjibaou's funeral on Sunday.
   The senior surviving leader of the front, Leopold Joredie, said
the group would continue participating in a ``peace process'' that
began last year and is to culminate in a 1998 referendum on
independence.
   A witness has said five or six gunmen participated in the
assassination.
   Tjibaou and Yeiwene were in Ouvea to take part in ceremonies
marking the first anniversary of the May 5 assault by French
military police on a cave where separatists were holding more than
20 police hostage. In the fighting, 19 separatists and two French
policemen died.
   The ceremonies were called off after Thursday's attack.
   Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of the
inhabitants of New Caledonia, which are islands 1,000 miles east of
Australia. Most natives favor independence.
   European settlers and their descendants make up 37 percent,
nearly all of whom want to remain part of France. The remaining
Polynesians and Asians, also are favorable to retaining the link to
France.

<TEXT>
   A major NATO dispute over short-range
nuclear weapons reflects a growing West German disenchantment with
a defense strategy that would destroy this front-line nation if war
broke out in Europe.
   The issue probably will be resolved with a compromise on what to
do about the short-range missiles on West German territory. But
Washington cannot afford to ignore the stirrings of its strongest
military partner.
   ``The days are over when you can sell a defense policy to
Germans that clearly threatens to turn their country into a smoking
pile of ruins,'' said Peter Danylow, a domestic and foreign policy
expert with the Bonn-based Foreign Affairs Institute.
   There is growing public impatience with NATO demands on West
Germany, which has 400,000 foreign troops on its soil as well as
conventional hardware and the bulk of the Western alliance's
short-range missiles.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, aware of the public mood and worried
about his political survival, called on Washington and Moscow to
negotiate the reduction of short-range stockpiles.
   U.S. and NATO strategists oppose a new round of negotiations on
those missiles until the Warsaw Pact has reduced its advantage in
conventional armaments. Bonn has balked on that point, causing rift
in the alliance.
   Those charting public opinion say the majority of West Germans
support the government.
   ``The West German public has realized as never before that these
weapons would spell the certain destruction of their nation if they
were ever used,'' said Heinz Timmermann, a defense and foreign
policy expert at the Cologne-based Institute for Eastern and
International Studies.
   ``In an era of warming relations with the Soviet bloc, many West
Germans cannot understand why this strategy should continue,''
Timmermann told The Associated Press.
   Most of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's shor-range
nuclear arsenal is deployed in West Germany _ 76 Lance missiles
with a range of about 75 miles. Should war break out and Soviet-led
forces invade West Germany, those nuclear weapons would be used
almost exclusively on West and East German soil.
   They are part of what NATO officials say is a vital flexible
response strategy that combines conventional forces with the threat
of using battlefield nuclear weapons.
   But West Germans increasingly view the policy as obsolete,
especially with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev offering friendship
to Western Europe. Bonn now says it believes the Warsaw Pact
military threat has diminished because of the reform and detente
policies of Gorbachev.
   Kohl's government has also said it wants to delay a decision on
the deployment of new missiles to replace the aging Lance systems
until at least 1991 _ after the 1990 election.
   The new rockets would have a significantly longer range, up to
300 miles, and West Germans to a degree share the Kremlin view that
their deployment would constitute a rearmament step.
   Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher have stood firm
on the demand for prompt talks, insisting Soviet overtures be met
with a Western readiness to compromise.
   Genscher, the architect of the current arms reduction effort,
has won widespread public support for his contention that Gorbachev
``should be taken at his word.''
   The foreign minister, who was born in what is now Communist East
Germany, has argued consistently over his 20-year Cabinet career
that it is as much in the West's interest as in the East's to
pursue all opportunities to improve ties between Europe's political
blocs.
   Still, President Bush said last week he opposes early
short-range talks. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain has
taken the American side in the dispute
   Sen. William S. Cohen, a Maine Republican, said in Washington
last week the United States should reconsider its policy of keeping
a large military force in West Germany.
   ``I think if the West German people have come to the conclusion
they can place more faith and reliance on Gorbachev's words and
assurances than they can upon sound NATO strategy, then it would be
very difficult for me to continue to commit the size of the forces
we have under those circumstances.''
   While Kohl has said he is optimistic a compromise can be found
before a NATO summit in Brussels May 29-30, he has also made it
clear that he wants West Germany's ``special situation and
interests'' acknowledged in an overall NATO policy statement.
   ``The West German people want to see real progress in
disarmament negotiations on issues that directly affect the fate
and future of this country,'' said Renate Koecher, a researcher at
the national Polling Institute in Allensbach.
   But pollsters and researchers say the overwhelming desire for
progress in East-West weapons talks has not seriously shaken the
nation's commitment to NATO.
   ``Most West Germans don't want their country to bolt from
NATO,'' said Koecher. ``But there is a strong sentiment in the
country that NATO should be able to adjust to the changes that have
occurred in recent years in East-West relations.''
   Many see NATO's reluctance on the short-range missile issue as
part of a broader unwillingness to gradually shift to political
solutions to East-West issues.
   Willfried Penner, a defense expert for the opposition Social
Democratic Party, said U.S. and British intransigence on the
short-range missiles ``makes NATO look increasingly like a military
fossil.''
   Some analysts predict the conflict is only the first salvo in
what promises to be a long and difficult debate over West Germany's
place in the alliance and its role in Europe.

   Astronauts awakened to their alma
maters' school songs today and resumed a light work schedule, while
the robot Magellan probe they had launched earlier raced onward at
7,000 mph on its 15-month voyage to Venus.
   The five astronauts aboard the shuttle Atlantis began work on
routine tests aboard the orbiter, including one that calls for
photographing night lightning strikes in the clouds below.
   Their day began shortly before 8 a.m. CDT with a medley of
military and schools tunes played for them by Mission Control.
   ``Good morning, Houston. Thanks for the great music,'' Atlantis
commander David Walker said. ``We did sleep well and we're ready to
roll today.''
   The songs played were ``Anchors Aweigh,'' for Walker, a Navy
captain; ``The Air Force Song'' (``Off we go, into the wild blue
yonder...'') for pilot Ronald Grabe and mission specialist Mark
Lee, both Air Force Academy graduates; and the school songs for
Colorado State, mission specialist Mary Cleave's alma mater, and
Florida State, which mission specialist Norman Thagard's attended.
   Except for a minor difficulty during breakfast, Atlantis
remained in good shape as the astronauts began their second full
day in orbit.
   ``All systems on Atlantis (are) functioning very well,'' Mission
Control commentator Jeffrey Carr said. ``We're starting the day
with a very clean bird, a very clean slate.''
   The astronauts had a little difficulty with breakfast when a
galley water device malfunctioned, dispensing ``almost any amount''
of water it wanted despite a precise setting, Lee said.
   ``It must be poetic justice to have a galley mal (malfunction)
with a maggot on board,'' Walker joked. Members of Lee's astronaut
class named themselves ``maggots.''
   After some unsuccessful tinkering with the device, the
astronauts attached a hose to it so they could control the flow of
water. Some of the freeze-dried food packages need a dose of hot or
cold water.
   Earlier today, while the crew members slept, cargo bay cameras
provided spectacular views of the Middle East and Africa. The
cameras were maneuvered by a ground controller and could be seen on
NASA television.
   The Magellan planetary probe, which will travel 806 million
miles before reaching Venus, was on a near perfect path and was in
excellent condition, officials said.
   It was only half a degree off normal, but that deviation was
expected and will be adjusted May 21 when a ground station sends a
signal to trigger a small motor firing on the probe, they said.
   Magellan, gently ejected Thursday night from the shuttle's cargo
bay, began its journey at a rate of 25,000 mph but had slowed
gradually to a cruising speed of about 7,000 mph. This morning, it
was expected to pass the plane of the moon some 240,000 miles from
Earth.
   When it reaches Venus in August 1990, the tug of the planet's
gravity will have increased the speed again to about 25,000 mph.
Once in orbit, the probe will use its high resolution radar system
to map up to 90 percent of the Venusian surface.
   Those images, enhanced by computers, are expected to show
features as small as a football field and be 10 times clearer than
pictures obtained by earlier spacecraft. The pictures should
provide an avalanche of data that could help scientists discover
how Venus evolved so differently from Earth.
   The $550 million mission is the first U.S. planetary project in
11 years and the first to be deployed from a shuttle.
   The astronauts' workload has been light because the heavy weight
of Magellan and its rocket booster, totaling 45,000 pounds,
restricted the number of experiments they could carry on the
four-day mission. The probe weighs 7,600 pounds.
   The crew members methodically went about their work Friday,
talking only sparingly with ground controllers at the Johnson Space
Center.
   Walker took some time out to thank the tracking station crews at
Guam and Santiago, Chile, who are covering their last shuttle
mission.
   The stations are among several being phased out because of the
completion of a network of communications satellites that allows
ground controllers to have nearly constant contact with shuttle
astronauts.
   ``Thanks for all the good work,'' Walker told the Santiago crew
late Friday night.
   Earlier Friday, the astronauts worked with a 128-pound
metals-processing furnace the size of a small microwave oven.
Samples of indium and selenium were melted and resolidified in the
furnace to see how they react in weightlessness.
   Potential applications for such space-made materials include
advanced electronic and optical devices.
   Also on board are medical experiments and several cameras for
photographing the Earth and lightning systems. Photographs of such
lightning strikes may one day help scientists improve weather
forecasting methods.
   Flight Director Ron Dittemore said the shuttle's systems were in
excellent condition and the only problems were ``just annoyances.''
   A facsimile machine being tested for sending documents to the
shuttle was shut down when its paper jammed and a machine for
measuring blood pressure failed, he said.
   Atlantis, which rocketed away from Kennedy Space Center on
Thursday afternoon, is scheduled to land Monday at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher has been the driving force in forming a new West German
position on nuclear missiles that has caused a rift in the NATO
alliance.
   Genscher has been the designated architect of West German
foreign policy for 15 years, the longest-serving foreign minister
in the West.
   He has charted the course for the nation's steady drift to the
East, expressing an eagerness for every chance to close the
capitalist-communist chasm. And he has stood guard over the gains
of Ostpolitik, the strategy forged by former Chancellor Willy
Brandt a generation ago to foster better relations between the
German states.
   Behind the 62-year-old politician's quest for better East-West
relations is a life deeply influenced by Germany's tragic past.
   Genscher was born in the Saxon town of Halle, now part of East
Germany, and returned to the Soviet-occupied sector of his homeland
after capture by Americans and imprisonment in Britain until the
end of World War II.
   After studying law at Leipzig University and growing
disenchanted with the new socialist state, he escaped to the West
in 1952 and entered politics by joining the small, liberal Free
Democratic Party.
   Now firmly in place as one of the nation's most popular
politicians, Genscher has been at the forefront of a West German
scramble to take advantage of new opportunities for East-West
cooperation brought about by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Impervious to warnings from other NATO allies that it may be too
soon to match initiatives from a Kremlin that remains better armed
than the West, Genscher has been pushing for a new round of
superpower talks aimed at removing short-range missiles from West
German territory.
   He has appealed to the allies to trust Gorbachev and ``take him
at his word.''
   He has made clear he aims for a dismantling of the divisions of
Europe, in particular the concrete and barbed-wire border dividing
the two Germanies.
   In a speech to the federal Parliament last week, Genscher stated
that his responsibility for guiding German policy ``does not end at
the border running through the middle of Germany. This obligation
includes my home, the city in which I was born.''
   Noting that Germans brought about the world war that left the
continent sharply divided into two opposing political blocs,
Genscher has often observed with a note of contrition that ``Europe
is our fate.''
   Critics have accused him of seeking a break with the Western
alliance, or of trying to give West Germany the first foot in the
door of potential economic deals with East bloc countries,
solidifying West Germany's role as the primary economic power in
Europe.
   But Genscher has steadfastly said he wants a peaceful and
prosperous Europe and a freer exchange between the two Germanies.
   ``Genscher has the specific interests of Western Europe in
mind,'' said Heinz Timmermann of Cologne's Institute for Eastern
and International Studies. ``It has nothing to do with the
government wanting a special path, nothing to do with neutrality.''
   Long troubled by health problems, including tuberculosis and
three heart attacks, Genscher has rebounded from his most recent
bout with illness and the death a few months ago of his 88-year-old
mother.
   He was hospitalized in March for surgery to correct a
urinary-tract problem, but his staff reports he has returned to his
grueling 16-hour-a-day schedule and has shown no signs of tiring.

<HEAD>Outbreak of Violence Has Ancient Roots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PODOR, Senegal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mob violence that has cost the lives of
hundreds of Senegalese and Mauritanians in each other's countries
is rooted in the ancient conflict of nomad and farmer and in the
river that is a lifeline for both.
   Long before a country named Senegal existed, before the enormous
colony called French West Africa was created, the black Toucouleur
people farmed the fertile basin on both sides of the Senegal River.
   Arab-Berber people known as Moors, living to the north in what
became Mauritania, were proud wanderers, herders of camels and
goats who had no interest in a sedentary life on the land.
   When the French left and the two nations were created, the river
became their border.
   Dams have made the basin more valuable, attracting Moorish
investors. Senegalese are being forced from land their forebears
tilled, and new restrictions are being applied to what once was
relatively free cross-border grazing, mostly by Mauritanian herds.
   In Diawara, a riverbank village, a burst of gunfire April 9
killed two Senegalese farmers. Some say Mauritanian border guards
did the shooting, others say Mauritanian tribesmen.
   The incident inspired a spree of reprisal lootings, beatings and
killings in many areas of both countries, particularly the
capitals: Dakar in Senegal and Nouakchott in Mauritania.
   Neither government has given casualty figures. Unofficial counts
indicate about 60 people were killed in Senegal and 200 in
Mauritania and that thousands were wounded.
   So bad did the violence become that Senegal and Mauritania
organized an air shuttle to bring their expatriates home. France,
Algeria, Morocco and Spain contributed planes.
   Neither government wants the conflict. Mustapha Ould
Abedarrahman, Mauritania's information minister, said in an
interview: ``We and Senegal are condemned to cooperate. There are
an enormous amount of things that unite us.''
   Senegalese living in Mauritania do nearly all the fishing,
operate taxis and work as manual laborers.
   Mauritanians have a near-monopoly on small retail business in
Senegal. Every neighborhood has its ``corner Mauritanian'' who
sells products in even the tiniest amounts _ a single cube of sugar
or a handful of rice.
   Both economies are fragile, in a process of restructuring
decreed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and will
suffer from the trouble.
   Historically, peasants in Podor and other villages along the
river have crossed to farm on the Mauritanian side.
   ``That land has belonged to us for centuries,'' said Mamadou
Solih Wone, the Moslem religious leader of Podor and also a farmer.
   ``A Moor doesn't farm,'' Wone said, sitting amid village elders
in a crumbling building on a street of red dirt. ``You will never
see one on the land.''
   ``I have felt this coming for years,'' said Taifour Ibra Wane,
mayor of the dusty town of 12,000.
   Last year, Mauritanian authorities began preventing Senegalese
from farming the other side of the river. Villagers acknowledge
they are crossing an international border but say they have worked
that land for centuries and should be compensated if they are
thrown off it.
   A Senegalese will tell you the historic border was 35 miles or
more north of the river. A Mauritanian will say the frontier was
south of it.
   ``And if it hadn't been for the French,'' an official in
Nouakchott said, ``the Moroccans would have controlled the whole
territory.''
   Mauritanian officials say the river is the border. North of the
river is Mauritania, they say, and if Mauritanians want to farm the
land they have every right to do so.
   All Mauritanian land is in the public domain and the government
will give it to any Mauritanian who wants to develop it.
   Farmers from Senegal say Moors don't want to get their hands
dirty by farming, that they are forming large agricultural
companies and becoming agri-businessmen, profiting from land
developed by Senegalese.
   Dams built near the mouth of the Senegal River at Diama, and at
Manantali in Mali, have brought vast changes. No longer must
farmers hope for an annual flood to soak the land; the dams
guarantee a flood each year.
   Irrigation is possible farther back from the river, making more
land arable and enticing investors. The prospects are of great
interest to Mauritania, which is 99 percent desert.
   ``The white Mauritanians want to take the land from the
Toucouleurs,'' said an agricultural technician who has worked in
the area for 25 years. ``They want all of a sudden to become
farmers and use the blacks as labor as they did with their old
slave system.''
   Senegalese frequently point out that Mauritania did not abolish
slavery until 1980 and that it continues in some areas of the
country.

<HEAD>Political Dogfight Shaping Up Over Marine Corps Aircraft Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney faces a major
battle with Congress over the cancellation of the V-22 Osprey
aircraft, which not only is a favorite of the Marine Corps but on
Capitol Hill as well.
   ``Of all the cuts Cheney has proposed the most difficult to get
is the V-22,'' House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
said Friday, hours before the Pentagon announced it would not spend
additional funds to continue the program for another five months.
   ``Stay tuned,'' Aspin said.
   Lawmakers had responded with outrage to Cheney's initial
announcement that he would eliminate the $25.9 billion program
after investing nine years and $2 billion in the battlefield
aircraft designed to take off like a helicopter and fly like an
airplane.
   Cheney called the decision painful but said the program would
have to go as he slashed $10 billion in fiscal 1990 spending under
the budget compromise reached by the White House and Congress.
   Hopes of congressional supporters were raised Thursday when
Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood Jr., indicated the Pentagon
was considering a reprieve for the aircraft as Bell Helicopter
Textron Inc. and Boeing Helicopter Co. threatened to halt work on
the project.
   Late Friday, however, the Pentagon said the V-22 would remain on
the fiscal 1990 budget cutting floor and warned the contractors
that they were expected to complete the work required under their
fiscal 1989 contract. That contract does not expire until Sept. 30.
   The contractors, meanwhile, said they had suspended their threat
of layoffs for the moment, citing the ``strong bipartisan
congressional support for the V-22 program.''
   That support for the Osprey is emerging from the powerful Marine
Corps lobby on Capitol Hill and the concerns of influential
lawmakers, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services
Committee said Friday.
   ``The Marine lobby per se is as tough as the NRA (National Rifle
Association),'' said Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, who noted that
after the considerable investment the Corps does not want to see
``a wasted effort on their part.''
   Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said that ``year after year the Marines have
made the V-22 their highest priority. It's vital to Marine
aviation.''
   The V-22 is a revolutionary aircraft that the Marine Corps wants
to use to improve its ability to conduct surprise, long-range
amphibious assaults. The Pentagon had planned to spend $25.9
billion on 663 Ospreys, including $1.3 billion in 1990.
   The contractors are located in Texas and Pennsylvania, both of
which have large and powerful delegations on Capitol Hill.
   Bell Helicopter Textron is in Fort Worth, Texas _ home district
of House Speaker Jim Wright. Boeing Helicopter Co. is in the home
state for two active defense lawmakers, Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., a
Marine Corps veteran, and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
   ``I very definitely hear a building crescendo,'' Dickinson said
Friday. ``I raised that point with Dick Cheney. The hottest and
most political issue will be the V-22. I told him to be ready and
expect a firestorm.''
   But lawmakers have begun to suggest other sources of funding to
keep the Osprey program.
   ``Star Wars,'' said McCloskey. ``The thinking is that too much
money is spent on SDI. For $3 billion you can get all the research
and development you need.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said it was too early to tell where the money would come
from, but then mentioned that ``everybody always looks at the SDI
money like the fox looking at the hen house.''

<HEAD>Budget Plan Sailing Through Despite Admitted Shortcomings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici spent six years as
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee fighting off attempts to
derail the spending plans he produced.
   But last week, the former chairman who's still central to any
budget deal dared other senators to take him on. ``I welcome those
who have something better to offer. I hope they will bring it down
here,'' said Domenici, R-N.M.
   Almost nobody did, and those were brushed away by by
overwhelming margins. In the House, debate was more carefully
scripted but the results were the same.
   The deficit-reduction agreement reached last month between
President Bush and congressional leaders has been accepted by the
rank and file, 68-31 in the Senate and 263-157 in the House.
   Although fine details remain to be worked out between the two
chambers, the final budget for fiscal 1990 will claim to reduce the
deficit by about $28 billion.
   There are no daring cutbacks in spending, only some slower
growth, not a hint that any federal program will be eliminated.
Federal assets would be sold, government fees raised, and a call
for $5.3 billion in new tax revenues maybe can be done without
violating Bush's ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge.
   ``Calling $5.3 billion in new taxes something other than a tax
should be a snap for President Bush,'' said Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, recalling the dozen or so times President
Reagan was able to accomplish that rhetorical feat.
   The budgets claim to reach the Gramm-Rudman law's requirement of
a deficit no larger than $100 billion in the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1. But critics argue that the unspecified tax boost is just
one of many instances of hocus-pocus in the budget documents.
   Billions of dollars of ``savings'' are nothing more than
bookkeeping changes, such as declaring the Postal Service
``off-budget'' and deeming a half-billion dollars in old,
unredeemed food stamps as no longer a government liability.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of Congress' Joint Economic
Committee, described the White House-congressional alliance as
this: ``They provide the smoke, and we provide the mirrors.''
   Sen. James Sasser, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,
acknowledged the shortcomings of the plan and said he hoped more
deficit reduction could be accomplished later.
   ``I have sat through hours and hours and hours of sincere debate
between honest and honorable men on virtually every possible
approach to the budget problem, and this is the best that we can do
at this particular time in our history,'' said Sasser, D-Tenn.
   Stan Collender, a former congressional budget staff member who
now follows fiscal issues for a private accounting firm, said the
lawmakers were just giving their constituents what they wanted.
   People believe the deficit is a serious problem, but ``no one
wants you to cut spending or raise taxes,'' he said.
   As a result, Congress must resort to gimmickry and optimistic
deficit figures that make it seem like they are attacking the
deficit.
   ``They feel compelled to deal with it in a way to make it appear
they've dealt with it in a serious way,'' he said.
   Carol Cox, head of the Committee for a Responsible Federal
Budget, disputes assertions that the general public isn't ready to
sacrifice in order to reduce the economic threat of the deficit.
   ``The public's so far ahead of their political leaders on this
one, it's a stitch,'' said Cox, who conducts public meetings around
the country to explore budget options.
   The politicians are using their budget deals to ``provide cover
for one another... to avoid dealing with the harsh realities of
life,'' she said. The process is so far along, ``they're not even
embarrassed about it any more,'' she said.

   From a faint picture of twin windmills on
Montmartre taken in 1839 to a blazing David Hockney collage
depicting the California desert of the 1980s, the National Gallery
of Art is saluting the history of photography with a mammoth new
exhibition opening Sunday.
   The show was touted by gallery director J. Carter Brown as
``probably the biggest and most ambitious'' of any museum
exhibition marking the 150th anniversary of photography this year.
   It contains 430 photographs by 200 of the world's best
photographers, from French pioneer Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre to
the likes of Henri Cartier-Bresson, Alfred Stieglitz, Ansel Adams,
Edward Weston, Walker Evans, Edward Steichen and Man Ray. The show
fills 13 rooms in the gallery's West Building.
   The shadowy photograph of the Montmartre windmills, captured by
a French civil servant and inventor named Hippolyte Bayard, is so
delicate that its frame is covered by a brown velvet curtain that
can be lifted by viewers in a dimly lighted room of the gallery.
   Similar treatment to minimize damage is accorded two other early
images by England's William Henry Fox Talbot, who developed the
first primitive photographic printing process and who described his
discovery as ``the art of fixing the shadow.''
   The exhibition is drawn from private and public collections
around the world, and is underwritten by a major grant from Eastern
Kodak Co. After it closes in Washington on July 30, the show will
appear from Sept. 16 to Nov. 26 at the Art Institute of Chicago,
which helped organize the show. The final stop of the tour will be
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Dec. 21 to Feb. 25.
   In conjunction with the photo exhibition, titled ``On the Art of
Fixing a Shadow: 150 Years of Photography,'' the National Gallery
is sponsoring a summertime film series highlighting the connection
between photography and cinematography.
   Among the 24 films to be shown from May 27 through Aug. 13 are
the original, uncut version of Abel Gance's 1927 classic,
``Napoleon,'' accompanied by the original live piano score, and
newly restored prints of Victor Sjostrom's ``The Outlaw and His
Wife'' of 1918 and D.W. Griffith's ``Way Down East'' of 1920.
   A companion exhibition titled ``The Photography of Invention,''
which opened recently at the Smithsonian Institution's National
Museum of American Art, explores revolutionary techniques by
American photographers of the 1980s.
   The 185 non-traditional works by 90 artists, many of whom were
trained in other disciplines, frequently use computer technology
and the visual vocabulary of advertising in their photographic
images.
   One work commissioned for the museum show, Nancy Burson's ``The
President,'' was created by feeding black-and-white images of
Presidents Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan into a computer to
produce a single portrait of a generic president, with President
Bush's features incorporated later.
   The National Gallery show features ``an impressive display of
creative talent'' in a medium so popular among professional artists
and amateur hobbyists that an estimated 50 billion pictures will be
taken this year, says Kodak vice president Raymond H. DeMoulin.
   Amateurs, who will account for 42 million of the total, also are
represented in the exhibition. Snapshots taken during the late 19th
century by such notables as French impressionist painter Edgar
Degas and England's Queen Alexandra are included.
   Among the show's four historical sections are landscapes of the
American West by Timothy O'Sullivan, battlefield scenes from the
Civil War and 20th century portraits by social reformers of child
laborers and migrant farm workers. Contemporary artists include
Warhol and his ``Sixteen Jackies'' portraits of Jacqueline Onassis.

<TEXT>
   Differences between the United States
and Panama over Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega have plunged relations
to their lowest point since 1964, when the countries temporarily
broke relations following anti-American riots.
   Here is a chronology of key events in the recent slide:
   June 1987 _ Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, the retiring commander of
the Defense Forces, accuses Noriega of drug-related activities, of
rigging the 1984 election in favor of government candidates, and of
murdering Dr. Hugo Spadafora, a former vice minister of health who
had accused Noriega of drug trafficking.
   June 9, 1987 _ A protest movement headed by the National Civic
Crusade, a grouping of professionals and students, demands a probe
into Hererra's allegations and a return to democray. Street
protests are crushed brutally.
   Feb. 4, 1988 _ A federal grand jury in Miami indicts Noriega on
drug-running charges. A grand jury in Tampa returns similar
indictments.
   Feb. 25, 1988 _ President Eric Delvalle, who was put in place by
Noriega, announces he has fired his patron. Eight hours later, the
National Assembly meets, ousts Delvalle and names Manuel Solis
Palma as Minister in Charge of the Presidency, a title he retains.
The United States refuses to recognize Solis Palma. The government
closes opposition news media.
   March 16, 1988 _ A coup organized by Defense Forces officers
against Noriega fails. Demonstrations erupt in the capital and a
power outage blacks out the nation.
   March 28, 1988 _ After a large anti-Noriega march, members of
the Defense Forces enter the Mariott Hotel, beating and arresting
journalists and opposition leaders.
   April 9, 1988 _ The United States announces economic sanctions
that prohibit American companies and the government from making
payments to the Panamanian government. Some $56 million in
Panamanian funds in American banks are frozen. The United States
tries to negotiate the departure of Noriega without success.
   May 9, 1988 _ Banks reopen but with severe restrictions,
including a freeze on savings accounts.
   Aug. 21, 1988 _ The United States releases a list of more than
240 incidents of alleged harassment of American military personnel
by Panamanian authorities so far that year.
   Sept. 13, 1988 _ The U.S. Defense Department reduces the tour of
duty for soldiers stationed in Panama to lower the number of
dependents in the country.
   Oct. 30, 1988 _ Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American
Affairs Elliot Abrams admits the Reagan administration's efforts to
oust Noriega have failed.
   April 9, 1989 _ Economic sanctions are renewed for one year on
the basis that Washington considers Panama a threat to American
security.
   April and May 1989 _ The United States accuses Panama of
planning to win May 7 presidential elections by fraud. News reports
contend the United States authorized $10 million for the Panamanian
opposition, which becomes a major campaign issue.

   No leaders have been toppled after three weeks of
the largest pro-democracy protests in communist China. Marching
students have won no promises of reform.
   But the tens of thousands of students have succeeded in breaking
through the accepted barriers on political discourse and have
altered, perhaps permanently, the terms in which Chinese speak of
their leaders.
   The students shouted at the portals of the powerholders things
that most Chinese previously were afraid to whisper even in private:
   ``Maybe (senior leader Deng Xiaoping) is crazy.''
   ``(Premier) Li Peng is Deng's puppet. He has no ability.''
   ``China has no press freedom.''
   ``The leaders are corrupt. They are dictators.''
   The students put up posters listing the high government posts
held by sons and daughters of top leaders.
   No one was sacred.
   The 84-year-old Deng's wheelchair-bound son, Deng Pufang, was
referred to as ``Prince Pufang,'' and charges of tax evasion and
other misdeeds by a company linked to him were recounted.
   Instead of being hauled off for ``education through labor,'' the
usual treatment for political critics, the students were merely
talked at _ first harshly, then with care as the extent of popular
support for them became evident.
   ``In dealing with the student activities, we must be very
prudent,'' government spokesman Yuan Mu told an unusual news
conference last week in which he and Education Minister He
Dongchang acknowledged government errors had caused widespread
discontent that was tapped by the students.
   The students' huge April 27 march on Tiananmen Square, in which
they and workers who joined them formed a mass 150,000 strong,
implictly established their right to march despite Beijing city
restrictions.
   When the students next marched May 4, the government made no
threats and no serious efforts to stop them.
   The first march began in an atmosphere of fear, but the May 4
march had a matter-of-factness about it that subtly illustrated how
much government limits had been pushed back in just one week.
   The student movement also revealed in the general public a
voracious appetite for political discussion. Several students said
they sought to destroy apathy and raise consciousness, and here
they clearly succeeded.
   One month ago, only a few bold intellectuals such as
astrophysicist Fang Lizhi were openly calling for democracy. After
the students began marching, it seemed everyone was.
   ``The main thing we created was an atmosphere,'' said Wang
Zhixin, one of the protest leaders. ``We have brought the word
democracy into the lives of the people of China ... (and) given the
people new confidence in criticizing the government.''
   Hundreds of ordinary citizens joined in pickup political
discussion circles near the campuses over the past few weeks,
reveling in the pleasure of speaking their minds.
   ``Even a few weeks ago no one would have dared to do this,''
said a young government employee watching one such group outside
the People's University a week ago. ``Chinese have been ignorant
for years. This is an education.''
   Some breakthrough also appears evident in the official media,
which at first was silent on the student protests. After many
Chinese reporters put unprecedented pressure on their bosses and
about 300 joined in the May 4 march, several papers described the
students' protests in sympathetic terms.
   What remains to be seen is how long these effects will linger
now that students with bullhorns have given Tiananmen Square back
to the ice cream vendors and kite-flyers.
   The students say they are determined to continue their democracy
movement in quieter ways, by setting up their own, independent
newspapers, holding political forums and distributing political
pamphlets on the streets.
   Such activities have been banned by Beijing police, and if the
students are allowed to continue them, this alone will constitute a
major breakthrough in a political system where the Communist Party
has long held a monopoly on political discussion.
   College students, however, make up only half a percent of
China's 1.2 billion people. Unless further heavy pressure is put on
the government, it remains inconceivable that workers, for example,
will be allowed to put out their own newspapers or pamphlets.
   At a minimum, students hope their pleas for democracy have been
noted by Western goverments that regularly apply pressure on the
Soviet Union to democratize but not China.
   ``Why do Westerners look down on Chinese and think they don't
want freedom?'' wondered a 37-year-old entrepreneur who applauded
the students. ``Chinese, Americans, Japanese _ we are all the same.
We all want freedom.''

   A helicopter carrying Chinese workers from an
offshore oil rig crashed near a port in northeastern China, killing
all 10 people on board, the official Xinhua News Agency said
Saturday.
   The two pilots and eight off-duty workers were being shuttled
from the Bohai Petroleum Corp. platform to the city of Tianjin when
the U.S.-made Bell-412 helicopter crashed at the city's port, the
agency said.
   One of the pilots was Japanese and the rest on board were
Chinese, the agency said.
   The helicopter was owned by Aero Asahi Corp. of Japan and leased
to the Tianjin branch of the China Offshore Helicopter Service
Corporation. The cause of the crash was not known.

<HEAD>Jury Learned About Defendant in His Own Words</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Oliver North trial had been in progress
for more than two months and his name had been woven through the
testimony like thread through cloth when North finally was called
to the stand.
   ``So you're Colonel North?'' said his lawyer.
   ``Yes, sir,'' said North, with a tight smile.
   ``It's traditional to start with your full name,'' prompted his
lawyer, Brendan Sullivan.
   ``Oliver Laurence, with-a-U, North,'' said the defendant.
   So began six days of questioning in which the 45-year-old North
tried to convince his jury that he was unjustly charged, that the
crimes laid to his feet had honorable roots, that his motives were
righteous and that his actions carried out the wishes of none other
than the president of the United States.
   That he largely succeeded was borne out by Thursday's verdict
which seemed to signal the jury's belief he should be punished only
for those things in which he had total control. Nobody ordered
North to accept an illegal gift _ the security fence around his
home _ and nobody ordered him to mutilate documents that would
expose his machinations.
   ``Did you intend to violate any law by receiving the security
system without paying for it?'' asked Sullivan.
   ``No, I intended to pay for it.``
   ``But did you ever pay for it?''
   ``No, I did not,'' said North.
   Even on the third conviction, creating false chronologies of the
Iran-Contra affair for Congress, the jury found only that he
``aided and abetted'' _ not that he was the principal. In that
charge, too, altering and shredding documents was an element. North
had testified that one of his bosses, former National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane, had ordered the doctored version.
McFarlane said it wasn't so.
   The Oliver North on the witness stand was not the Oliver North,
seen by millions on television, who told Congress ``I did a lot of
things and I want to stand up and say I'm proud of them.'' Neither
was he the Oliver North of last week's television fiction who so
idolized powerful men that he wound up as everybody's patsy.
   After two years under the Iran-Contra cloud, North had changed.
The boyish brown hair had grayed. His passionate patriotism hadn't
dimmed, but in court it was muted. He was being talked about as if
he had left the room and North reacted by busying himself taking
miles of notes with his left hand. He still knew who the enemy was.
Four days in a row, prosecutor John Keker said, ``Good Morning, Mr.
North'' and the witness pointedly remained mute.
   The six rows of ribbons _ Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry,
Bronze Star marked with V for valor for heroism, Purple Heart for
being twice wounded in action _ had given way to dark suits and
ultra-conservative ties. There was nothing, either, to replace the
presidential service badge that had adorned his right breast in
1987.
   The jury got to know more about North through his own testimony
than through the testimony of others.
   ``How many engagements with the enemy would you have encountered
during your time in Vietnam?'' asked Sullivan.
   ``Oh, I don't know that I never really kept track,'' North
replied. ``Roughly 100 I would suppose.''
   He said that when Congress passed the Boland Amendment in 1984,
forbidding military aid to the guerrillas fighting Nicaragua's
leftist government, ``it was clear that they wanted to find some
way of continuing the support'' _ they, being the White House.
   The CIA, he said, had been providing everything ``from the
little tents that they lived in, to the homes that they had for
their children, to the food they ate, the weapons they carried, the
bullets they had _ everything had come form the CIA. All of the
intelligence, all of the operations planning.''
   Q. What did you understand your assignment to be?
   A. I understood it very clearly to be that I would be the one to
replace the CIA for each of these activities.
   But what about the Boland Amendment? ``I talked to Director
Casey. I talked to Mr. McFarlane. I talked to the NSC lawyers ...
none of them thought that it applied to the NSC.''

   North said William Casey, the CIA director, told him a man to
help him accomplish what he was after was Richard Secord, a retired
Air Force major general with expertise in running covert supply
operations.
   ``He started out basically delivering munitions. I mean, that
was the first step. He became a person who arranged for the
shipping of the munitions out of Europe. ... It then expanded to
include air delivery of those munitions. He was eventually in the
process of building warehouses at various airfields around Central
America that could do these things, because we couldn't use any of
the U.S. government facilities that had been set up under the CIA.
We tried very hard to stay within the line that was drawn by
Boland.''
   Casey also gave him the names of people to work with in Central
America.
   Q. Whenever you had such a contact with an official of a
neighboring country in Central America, would you always have the
permission of your superiors?
   A. Yes, sir. I never made a single trip down there ... never
made single contact with anybody down there without the permission,
express permission of either Mr. McFarlane or Admiral Poindexter,
and, usually, when I could, with the concurrence of Director Casey.
   And, asked Sullivan, did President Regan himself act to help the
freedom fighters ``for example, by calling the presidents of
foreign countries?''
   Yes, sir, said North.
   What about the fund-raising he was accused of?
   ``I was told specifically that I could not, personally, me,
Ollie North, ask them for money, that I was a government official.
... I never recall a single instance where a donor, a person who
has shown up now in these lists of names, who gave money, ever gave
money in my presence, was ever asked to give money in my presence.''
   Q. You are accused in this case, Colonel North, of conspiracy to
commit a tax fraud. Did you do so?
   A. No, sir. I did not.
   North said that when Congress asked for information in 1985
about his activities, McFarlane, then the national security adviser
told him to alter six memos dealing with raising money from third
countries and details of NSC military assistance to the Contras.
   He said he didn't get around to doing that until the Iran-Contra
connection became known a year later when, he said, McFarlane
asked, ``Did you ever take care of that other stuff way back when,
what did you do with that or words to that effect.
   ``I said, well, I haven't taken care of it yet, but I will. And
then I went and had the documents pulled from the files and altered
them consistent with what he had earlier asked me to do.''
   Sullivan: Did you believe it was unlawful to do that?
   North: No, I had written those documents. I had prepared them
for him. They were his documents. It never occurred to me that that
could be unlawful.
   Sullivan: When you didn't disclose information they were looking
at, did you believe your conduct was unlawful.
   North: I was raised to know the difference between right and
wrong. I knew it wasn't right not to tell the truth on those
things, but I didn't think it was unlawful.
   Others had hesitated to attack North because of his war record.
But not prosecutor John Keker, who was _ like North _ wounded as a
Marine officer in Vietnam.
   Keker needled North by intimating he had violated the honor code
he was taught at the U.S. Naval Academy.
   ``In the United States Naval Academy you would be kicked out for
this, wouldn't you?'' he asked at one point.
   ``In the United States Naval Academy nobody taught me how to
deal with running a covert operation, Mr. Keker,'' North shot back.
``Nobody taught me how to run a covert operation in the Marine
Corps. I was trying my everloving best to get it done and the fact
is that nobody in the United States Naval Academy teaches you about
the internecine political warfare that was going on in Washington
from 1983 to 1986.''
   Keker: Did any moral bell go off in your head?
   North: It wouldn't be proper for me to describe it as a moral
bell. I thought it was extraordinarily immoral to have fielded a
force (the Contras), put it in the field, equipped it, trained it,
fed it, clothed it, armed it, sent it into combat and then left it
in the lurch. I thought it was heinous.''
   North seemed particularly stung by Keker's assertion in his
closing argument that North and McFarlane had been ``following
Adolf Hitler's old strategy: The victor will never be asked if he
told the truth.''
   On Thursday, after the verdict, North read a statement to
reporters recalling that Keker ``has likened me to Adolf Hitler.''
   Said North: ``As a Marine, I was taught to fight and fight hard
for as long as it takes to prevail. We will continue this battle.''

   Pakistan will give AIDS tests to all
foreigners living in Pakistan and to citizens who have lived
abroad, it was reported Saturday.
   Health Minister Amir Haider Kazmi disclosed the new policy
Friday, newspapers reported. He was quoted as saying the testing
would begin ``some time after June.''
   Finland will lend Pakistan $17 million to buy AIDS testing
equipment for 440 health facilities in major cities, Kazmi said.
   All foreigners living here for six months or more, as well as
Pakistanis who have recently lived abroad, will be required to
undergo the test, he said. He did not give further details.
   There is no known cure for AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, which attacks the body's immune system.
   According to Kazmi, 29 AIDS cases have been reported in this
country of 107 million. Six are Pakistanis and the rest foreigners,
mainly from Africa, he said. Three AIDS victims have died, he said.

   The Pentagon needs to improve military schools
for intermediate and senior officers by upgrading faculties and
making coursework tougher, according to a report by a House Armed
Services panel.
   ``What I would like to see us do to is return these schools to
their former premier positions that we had before World War II,''
said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., the chairman of the panel, which
spent a year studying the ``graduate'' schools operated by the four
military services and the Pentagon.
   The panel released Saturday a 206-page report calling for a
greater focus on formal military education and increased
cooperation among the services.
   ``In military strategy terms, there has not been a determination
of the `center of gravity' in the curricula on which each level of
schools should focus,'' the report said.
   It said the system now is marked by a ``diffusion of efforts and
unnecessary redundancy.''
   Skelton called the study the first comprehensive review by
Congress of the five intermediate command and staff colleges, which
traditionally are for majors or lieutenant commanders, and the five
senior war colleges, which are for colonels and lieutenant colonels
or Navy commanders or captains.
   About 3,000 U.S. officers attend the programs each year.
   Although Skelton described the overall system as ``sound,'' he
said there were significant shortcomings.
   The report called for tougher coursework as well as more graded
examinations, papers and reports, and small discussion seminars
instead of large lecture classes.
   The report criticized the two Air Force schools for having the
most classroom hours with ``passive education,'' such as auditorium
lectures, symposiums and films. At the senior-level Air War
College, 62 percent of the core curricula relied on ``passive
learning,'' compared with 10 percent at the Army's intermediate
school at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.
   More civilian teachers should be hired at some schools, the
report said. It urged more emphasis in the military on teaching as
an important assignment. Most officers now see command and
headquarter staff duty as the way to the top.
   ``In some instances, it's the kiss of death to be named to teach
in some of these schools,'' Skelton said.
   The panel intends to introduce legislation to give all of the
military services the ability to fix independent pay scales for
civilian teachers, something only the Navy can do now. Skelton said
removing pay limits will clear the way for recruiting top civilians
who otherwise would teach in universities.
   Not enough Navy officers attend the schools, with only 8 percent
going to both the intermediate Navy Command and Staff College and
the senior-level College of Naval Warfare, the report said. It said
the best officers generally go only to the senior school.
   ``They're beginning to change that but it's still not any where
close to where it should be,'' said Skelton. ``That's a serious
problem.''
   The Navy contends that the demand for officers has grown with
the expansion of the fleet, leaving fewer available for
professional schooling.
   Last fall, the panel issued preliminary recommendations that
included revising the National War College and making it the
National Center For Strategic Studies, focusing not only on
military strategy but political, economic and diplomatic matters.

   A small fire broke out in the cargo hold of a

said Saturday.
   No one was injured in the incident, said Claus Dehio, public

   The jetliner landed Friday, 18 minutes after leaving the British
colony for Bangkok, because smoke warning signals were activated in
the rear cargo compartment, Dehio said.
   The fire extinguishing system aboard the jetliner put out the
fire before the plane landed in Hong Kong, he said. Dehio said the
blaze was believed caused by overheating in the cargo area.

<TEXT>
   A U.N. official proposed African countries
make confidential reports on the spread of AIDS in their countries
to encourage more accurate information on the disease, a news
report said Saturday.
   Lobe Monekosso, the U.N. World Health Organization's director
for Africa, said current reporting on the spread of AIDS in Africa
is ``haphazard, irregular and underestimated,'' the Standard
newspaper said.
   ``Most African countries do not want to be associated with AIDS
or are shy about divulging the real numbers of cases,'' Monekosso
said. ``I propose we adopt semi-confidential reporting.''
   Monekosso said the number of people in Africa infected with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome could be as high as 1 million.
   Last month, WHO reported 10,918 cases of AIDS in Africa.
   There is no known cure for AIDS, which attacks the body's immune
system.
   In the United States and Europe, AIDS has been largely confined
to male homosexuals, hemophiliacs and intravenous drug abusers. In
Africa, it is believed to be transmitted primarily through
heterosexual contact.

   Iraq is negotiating with
France to help rebuild a nuclear reactor that was destroyed by
Israeli planes in 1981, an Iraqi official was quoted as saying
Saturday.
   ``Iraq is determined to rebuild the Tamouz nuclear reactor for
peaceful purposes, and negotiations for this purpose have started
with France,'' Hussein Kamal, minister of industry and military
production, was quoted as saying by the Sharjah newspaper Khaleej.
   Kamal, interviewed while on a visit to Egypt, said the nuclear
capabilities of both Iraq and Egypt are well-known ``and that both
countries have no intention of manufacturing or possessing nuclear
(weapons) capability.''
   He said his country was ``well-prepared'' if Israel carries out
a threat to attack the reactor.
   Israeli warplanes destroyed the Osirak nuclear reactor at
Tamouz, outside Baghdad, in 1981. Israel accused Iraq of attempting
to develop a nuclear warhead that could reach Israel.
   Israel has refused to confirm reports that it stockpiles nuclear
weapons, saying only that it will not be the first country to
introduce such weapons to the Middle East.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was quoted in an interview
published in Kuwait and Egypt as indicating he has assurances
Israel will not attack Iraqi military targets or its nuclear
program.
   ``According to my personal information, there is no aggressive
Israeli intention against Iraq,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying in
both the Kuwaiti daily Anbaa and the Cairo daily al-Gomhouria. ``My
information and the talk that I hear from them (the Israelis)
affirms that Israel has no intention to strike at anything in
Iraq.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanians vote Sunday for a
president, two vice-presidents and 67 legislators. Here are some
key facts about the candidates, the elections and the issues:
   CANDIDATES _ Carlos Duque, 59, is the presidential candidate of
the eight-party pro-government coalition COLINA, the Spanish
acronym for National Liberation Coalition. Duque is a long-time
associate and business partner of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and
was hand-picked by him.
   Guillermo Endara, 53, a founder of the Panamanista Party, heads
the ticket of the three-party the Democratic Opposition Alliance,
or ADO.
   Hildebrando Nicosia, who controls the Panamanistas, is a minor
presidential candidate.
   VOTING _ About 1.2 million of Panama's 2.2 million residents are
registered. The 4,255 ballot boxes in 1,940 voting centers will
open at 7 a.m. and close at 5 p.m. local time (8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
EDT). Results have been promised within 24 hours after the polls
close. Voting is not obligatory.
   OFFICES _ Panama's constitution specifies a five-year term for
president and no re-election until at least 10 years after leaving
office. The 67 members of the National Assembly also serve five
years. Voters also will pick 510 precinct representatives, who have
minor administrative duties.
   ISSUES _ The election basically is a referendum on Noriega,
commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces and de facto leader of
Panama. He continues nearly 21 years of military rule started by
Gen. Omar Torrijos in 1968.
   The government depicts the opposition as traitors who will
submit to U.S. pressure to void the treaty that gives the Panama
Canal to Panama at the end of the century. They say two drug
-related indictments against Noriega in the United States are a
ploy to justify American intervention in Panama.
   The opposition contends that government corruption and
incompetence have ruined Panama and that only a democratic
government without Noriega can restore progress.
   OBSERVERS _ Panama has invited observer teams from the European
Parliament and Latin American and Caribbean nations and has said
univited groups will be unwelcome. Not withstanding, President Bush
named an American delegation. Panama has welcomed an unofficial
American delegation headed by former President Jimmy Carter who,
with Torrijos, signed the canal treaties.

   Service-sector growth in the economy soon will
slow dramatically, leaving the nation little choice but to restore
its manufacturing might or risk creating an underclass dependent on
declining wages, according to a leading economist.
   ``The United States is probably at a fundamental turning
point,'' Lester Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
concluded in a study released Saturday.
   ``For the past 40 years, service employment has supplied the
bulk of the new jobs in the United States, and for the past 10
years all of them. In the decade ahead this pattern is apt to
change,'' he said.
   The government on Friday reported the slowest month-to-month
growth in the service sector in nearly three years, although it
still expanded while manufacturing posted declines.
   According to Thurow, dean of MIT's Sloan School of Management,
the downward trend in manufacturing has to end for a number of
reasons, primarily the need of the United States to erase its trade
deficit, running at an annual rate of $115 billion so far this year.
   ``Eventually, the dollar will fall to whatever level is
necessary for the United States to balance its international
accounts,'' Thurow concluded in the study. ``At that point the
United States will either export more manufactured goods or replace
imported manufactured goods with domestically made alternatives.''
   Foreign debt has cost the United States more than 4 million
manufacturing jobs, Thurow projected, saying the formula for
solving the trade defict was restoring those manufacturing jobs in
addition to any added by general economic growth.
   As a practical matter, Thurow said those jobs also will be
necessary to prevent higher unemployment because of his projected
halt in service-sector growth.
   Thurow cited a number of factors to support the projection.
Among them:
   _Intensive efforts to rein in health care costs, which in turn
would cut demand for workers.
   _A natural end to restaurant growth because most meals now are
eaten away from home, as well as a decline for sales personnel
because of a natural limit to longer shopping hours. Those two
factors in turn would result in lower demand for real estate and
building maintenance.
   _A peak in demand for white collar workers, which in turn would
adversely affect office construction.
   _Sinking demand in financial services because of growing
pressure on American financial institutions as the marketplace
becomes increasingly global and foreign institutions offer cheaper
loans and other products.
   Taking those factors into account, Thurow concluded that the
United States has little choice if it wants to erase its trade
deficit and avoid high unemployment.
   ``These jobs have to come in manufacturing since they can come
in nothing else,'' he wrote.
   At the same time, he called for a re-examination of the low-wage
structure of the U.S. service economy.
   In a background paper included in the Thurow study, Louise
Waldstein, an associate at Klein and Co. Inc, a management
consulting group, said wages in portions of the service-sector that
traditionally offer low pay need to be raised in return for
productivity gains.
   ``Millions of people are in the growing industries of retail
trade or building services and earn less than the wages necessary
to support a satisfactory standing of living,'' Waldstein wrote.
``Such a large proportion of American workers are in these low paid
jobs that we may be creating an entire group of working Americans
unable to support themselves adequately on on full-time earnings.
Clearly, increasing low-wage employment contributes to a decline in
the standard of living.''
   Thurow pointed to the poor productivity of American
service-sector workers compared to those of West Germany and Japan.
   While there has been some increased demand for services,
particularly health care because of the aging population, Thurow
attributed the majority of job growth in most of the sector to
falling or sluggish productivity growth.
   In contrast, producivity among service-sector workers in West
Germany and Japan has increased dramatically, with the foremost
factor the higher wages paid for service jobs in those countries,
Thurow said.
   Factors behind the higher wages include higher minimum wages,
enforcement of those wage floors and greater unionization, he said.
   Had American productivity growth mirrored that of Germany, he
said, the United States would have added only 3.6 million of the
15.5 million new service jobs generated between 1972 and 1983.

<TEXT>
   Panamanians vote Sunday for a
president, two vice-presidents and 67 legislators. Here are some
key facts about the candidates, the elections and the issues:
   CANDIDATES _ Carlos Duque, 59, is the presidential candidate of
the eight-party pro-government coalition COLINA, the Spanish
acronym for National Liberation Coalition. Duque is a longtime
associate and business partner of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and
was chosen by Noriega to be the candidate.
   Guillermo Endara, 53, a founder of the Panamanista Party, heads
the ticket of the three-party Democratic Opposition Alliance, or
ADO.
   Hildebrando Nicosia, of the Panamanistas, is a minor
presidential candidate.
   VOTING _ About 1.2 million of Panama's 2.2 million residents are
registered. The 4,255 ballot boxes in 1,940 voting centers will
open at 7 a.m. and close at 5 p.m. Results have been promised
within 24 hours after the polls close. Voting is not mandatory.
   OFFICES _ Panama's constitution specifies a five-year term for
president and no re-election until at least 10 years after leaving
office. The 67 members of the National Assembly also serve five
years. Voters also will pick 510 precinct representatives, who have
minor administrative duties.
   ISSUES _ The election basically is a referendum on Noriega,
commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces and de facto leader of
Panama. He continues nearly 21 years of military rule started by
Gen. Omar Torrijos in 1968.
   The government depicts the opposition as traitors who will
submit to U.S. pressure to void the treaty that gives the Panama
Canal to Panama at the end of the century. They say two U.S.
drug-related indictments against Noriega are a ploy to justify
American intervention in Panama.
   The opposition contends that government corruption and
incompetence have ruined Panama and that only a government without
Noriega can restore democracy and progress.
   OBSERVERS _ Panama has invited observer teams from the European
Parliament and Latin American and Caribbean nations and has said
univited groups will be unwelcome. But President Bush named an
American delegation anyway.
   Panama has welcomed an unofficial American delegation headed by
former President Jimmy Carter who, with Torrijos, signed the canal
treaties.

   The Bush administration, anticipating that
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega will try to rig national elections in
Panama, is considering additional punitive measures against the
military leader after Sunday's balloting, according to U.S.
officials.
   The officials said the options range from an effort to seize
Noriega's assets abroad to enlisting the support of friendly
democratic countries in a campaign to increase Panama's
international isolation.
   ``There is no possibility of no response,'' said one official,
alluding to the alleged efforts by the Panamanian government to use
fraudulent means to defeat the opposition slate in the elections.
   According to the official, there have been discussions within
the government about the possibility of taking legal action to
seize Noriega's assets in the United States and Europe.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said there are no
reliable figures on the amount of these assets but they are
believed to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Noriega was indicted last year by two Florida grand juries on
drug smuggling charges.
   For more than a week, there has been a steady drumbeat of
administration allegations that Noriega has been laying the
groundwork for a rigged process aimed at ensuring victory for his
handpicked presidential candidate, Carlos Duque.
   On Friday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
expressed suspicion about a huge increase in the
officially-announced numbers of registered voters over the past
five years, suggesting that the figures were falsified.
   Panamanian authorities, meanwhile, have been accusing the United
States of meddling in the election, seizing on published reports
that the administration secretly provided $10 million to the
opposition coalition.
   The Reagan administration imposed a series of sanctions against
Panama last year after Noriega and his allies ousted President Eric
Arturo Delvalle. Among other actions, $50 million in Panamanian
government assets in the United States were frozen.
   The United States continues to recognize Delvalle as the
legitimate authority in Panama and has said there can be no
normalization of relations with any Panamanian government dominated
by Noriega.
   The officials cautioned that no concrete decisions have been
made on future punitive action if, as expected, a fraudulent
election is held.
   Over the medium term, one decision that will be forced on the
administration concerns the appointment for the first time of a
Panamanian as administrator of the Panama Canal Commission, which
is responsible for running the waterway.
   The canal treaties specify that Panama later this year will
nominate a candidate to head the commission, subject to U.S.
approval and Senate confirmation.
   The nominee would take office next year but would be subject to
policy guidelines issued by the canal's board of directors, where
U.S. members are in the majority.
   The official said his personal view is that the administration
will not accept a Noriega-nominated candidate but the final
decision on that issue has not yet been made.
   If the U.S. refuses to allow a Panamanian to lead the
commission, this could leave the administration open to charges of
violating the canal treaties. For the time being, however, the
administration position is that it has every intention of abiding
by the terms of the treaty.
   Noriega, a 52-year-old U.S.-trained military man, has gone from
a favorite of U.S. anti-drug and intelligence agencies to an
outcast whom the U.S. now accuses of corruption, drug trafficking
and internal repression.
   Noriega was intelligence chief under the late dictator Omar
Torrijos and as such collaborated with U.S. agencies for years.
Like Torrijos, he has maintained contacts with Latin governments
and military leaders not too friendly to the United States.
   His backers maintain the United States would have been better
advised to work with Noriega in exploiting those ties than trying
to oust him.
   ``The U.S. government has acted in a very stupid manner,'' Maj.
Edgardo Lopez, a spokesman for Noriega, said recently in Panama
City. ``The drug charge against Noriega is a cover. The U.S. does
not care about drugs. If it did it would fight consumption at home.
They want Noriega out because he opposed an invasion of Nicaragua
and the training of Contras in Panama and because he opposes plans
by the United States to keep its forces here beyond the year 2000.''
   Besides freezing Panamanian government funds in the United
States, the Bush administration has withheld Panama Canal fees of
more than $90 million and has refused to pay Panamanian taxes the
Canal Commission withholds from its Panamanian employees' salaries.
   Even so, U.S. expenditures in Panama total more than $500
million a year, largely from the 12,000 U.S. soldiers at military
installations of the Southern Command. That gives the United States
considerably more leverage for increased economic pressure if it so
desires.

<HEAD>Criticism of Cold Fusion Dismissed in Utah</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Derision from outside experts hasn't
wilted hometown enthusiasm for tabletop experiments to create
fusion at room temperature or dampened state political support for
the Utah chemist whose claim startled the scientific world.
   ``There was criticism of Pasteur when he didn't handle his
things exactly the way conventional wisdom said he should handle
them,'' said Republican Gov. Norm Bangerter, who persuaded the
Legislature last month to appropriate $5 million for additional
fusion research at the University of Utah.
   Like Louis Pasteur, the 19th century chemist who refuted such
accepted theories as spontaneous generation and developed
pasteurization and the anthrax and rabies vaccines, Utah scientists
hope to have a hand in developing a process with great economic
significance.
   ``There's a lot of money at stake. ... There's certainly a great
deal of professional jealousy,'' said Bangerter.
   Stanley Pons, a Utah chemistry professor, and Martin
Fleischmann, a chemist at the University of Southampton in England,
announced March 23 they had sustained a controlled fusion reaction
by running current through a palladium electrode dipped in ``heavy
water,'' water made from a variant of hydrogen called deuterium.
   They contend that their experiments produce 10 times the amount
of energy they consume, enough to boil water and, conceivably, spin
turbines to produce electricity. Such ``cold fusion'' _ cold in
comparison with the ultrahigh temperatures scientists have thought
were necessary to achieve fusion _ could provide the world with a
relatively safe and virtually inexhaustible energy supply.
   If the experimenters are wrong, their work could join the
permanent artificial heart, also a Utah invention, as a curiosity
in the annals of failed science.
   Scientists and editorial writers have chastised the university
for trumpeting unconfirmed claims. The Utah response has been to
close ranks.
   Bangerter and lawmakers insist the $5 million, which is to be
spent only when an advisory council appointed by the governor is
satisfied the fusion claims have merit, is a prudent investment in
the state's future. In Washington, Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, is
pushing a bill to create a $25 million fusion research center in
Salt Lake City.
   Criticism at am American Physical Society meeting Tuesday in
Baltimore bordered on ridicule. Physicists from Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Stanford University and other prestigious
scientific centers declared that Pons and Fleischmann had made
fundamental errors in calculating the heat generated by their
experiment.
   The denunciations stunned even Brigham Young University
physicist Steven Jones, who also claims to have achieved cold
fusion in a jar but has criticized Utah's claims of excess heat.
   ``I was suprised at the Pons-Fleischmann criticism and actually
a bit shocked at some of the comments,'' said Jones, whose own
work, which produced far less energy, received much kinder
treatment at the conference.
   ``Frankly, I think it was too strident, but I don't think
they're motivated by professional jealousy. They're opinionated
people,'' Jones said of the critical physicists, many of whom have
spent years working on thermonuclear, or ``hot,'' fusion.
   Ray Hixson, chairman of the state's newly created Fusion-Energy
Advisory Council, said: ``Academics don't take this sort of thing
very easily. They react by protecting their own turf and own
research.''
   The council will meet May 19 to establish criteria for
determining whether the experiment has been confirmed. Hixson said
he wants to see the Utah claims duplicated at two or three other
institutions before any of the $5 million is spent.
   Nevertheless, he said he is convinced there is fusion in the
Utah test tubes.
   ``The question in our minds is, can it have a practical value?''
Hixon said. ``What they did, they did, and they measured it
correctly.''
   Owens said enthusiasm in Congress for cold fusion was chilled by
the Baltimore meeting. But James Brophy, the university's vice
president for research, predicted opinions will change after a
meeting of the Electrochemical Society in Los Angeles on Monday.
   He said several universities that have at least partly confirmed
the Utah results will present papers, as will Pons and Fleischmann.

<HEAD>Blacks, Whites, Mourn Together for Slain Anti-Apartheid Activist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of black and white
mourners Saturday staged the largest anti-apartheid march of the
3-year-old state of emergency, chanting through whites-only suburbs
in a funeral procession for an assassinated white activist.
   Young blacks gave clenched fist salutes, waved banners and sang
in support of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement as they jogged in unison behind the hearse or perched atop
overflowing buses for a six-mile journey from a downtown cathedral
to a cemetery.
   David Webster, 44, was killed outside his home Monday by a
shotgun blast fired at close range from a passing car. Police have
issued sketches of three unidentified white men suspected in the
killing, which provoked grief and anger throughout the
anti-apartheid movement.
   A professor of anthropology, Webster was one of the few senior
white members of the predominantly black United Democratic Front, a
nationwide anti-apartheid coalition. He was a leading critic of
detention without trial and had researched the numerous unsolved
killings and abductions of anti-apartheid activists that have
occurred over the past decade.
   ``He helped us realize there are white people who are human
beings,'' said the Rev. Frank Chikane, a black church leader, at a
three-hour funeral service at St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral. ``His
life should be a message to all white South Africans to rediscover
the humanity that could make this country free.''
   More than 2,000 people of all races filled the cathedral.
Hundreds more stood outside, singing freedom songs.
   Hundreds of policemen, some in helicopters, monitored the
funeral and the route which the roughly 5,000 marchers and
bus-riders took to West Park Cemetery. Police stayed away from the
gravesite, where four young blacks unfurled a large ANC flag after
hiding their faces.
   Other youths joined clergymen in sprinkling dirt onto the wooden
coffin after it was lowered into the grave. Said one of the
ministers, veteran white activist Beyers Naude: ``David is saying
`Stop the violence, stop the killings, stop the injustice.'''
   Anti-government parades are illegal in South Africa, and most
funerals of slain activists have been restricted by police during
the emergency, with limits placed on the number of mourners,
content of speeches, and size of the funeral procession.
   But Webster's funeral was not restricted, and policemen watched
impassively as throngs of militant mourners paraded past them.
   At the cathedral, eulogies were interspersed with performances
by white and black singers and a black jazz group. The mourners
included diplomats from the United States and other Western
countries, human rights activists from across South Africa,
residents of a remote Zulu community where Webster conducted
research, and fellow supporters of a Soweto soccer team, the
Orlando Pirates.
   Those in the crowd included Raymond Suttner, a white
anti-apartheid academic freed last year after two years in
detention; Johnny Clegg, South Africa's most successful pop music
star, who flew back from a U.S. tour to honor Webster; and Winnie
Mandela, wife of jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, a United Democratic Front official and
former detainee, described Webster as ``a gallant soldier whose
determination to fight apartheid was more important than his life.''
   He said Webster's support of detainees during the emergency, in
which about 30,000 activists have been held without charge for
varying periods, ``denied the government the ability to break our
spirits.''
   Helen Joseph, an 84-year-old white activist whom South African
media are not allowed to quote, was the first speaker.
   ``The guilt for David's death lies squarely on the shoulders of
the National Party government,'' she said.

   Tornadoes ripped into the Carolinas, flipping cars, toppling
church steeples and wrecking homes and businesses as thunderstorms,
high winds and heavy rain pounded across the South for a second day.
   The storms were blamed for the deaths of at least 18 people
since Thursday night, including two young girls who were in a car
that was swept away by churning floodwaters in Virginia. Four
people died in North Carolina; at least two in South Carolina; two
in Louisiana; seven in Texas; and one in Oklahoma.
   ``You're not going to believe it when it's daylight again,''
Deputy Sheriff Herb Bryant said Friday outside a demolished home in
Lincoln County, N.C. ``It took out an entire hill of hardwood trees
and threw cars around so much you couldn't tell where they came
from.''
   Three people were killed Friday when their homes were destroyed
near Toluca, about 50 miles northwest of Charlotte, according to
the state emergency management office in Raleigh. A fourth victim
died this morning in Charlotte Memorial Hospital, office
coordinator Jack Hughes said.
   In addition to the dead, nearly 100 people were treated for
storm-related injuries in North Carolina, including 21 who were
hospitalized at least overnight.
   Tornadoes also left at least two dead in Spartanburg County,
S.C., overturned cars and destroyed property in Georgia and
destroyed a house in West Louisville, Ky. In South Carolina, Gov.
Carroll Campbel planned to tour hardest-hit parts of the state
later today.
   In Culpeper County, Va., 3-year-old Sabrina Lewis and
6-month-old Carla Frances Lewis drowned Friday night after their
mother was sucked out of their car and into a tree when she tried
to open a door on a flooded bridge. The car washed downstream with
the children inside; the mother was treated for minor injuries.
   State police in Buchanan County, Va., were investigating an
unconfirmed report that two men in a pickup truck drowned in the
Powell River.
   Torrential rains flooded parts of northern Louisiana with as
much as 11 inches of rain Thursday night. Two men were found
drowned near their cars, and divers searched a flooded drainage
canal this morning for a 9-year-old boy who reportedly fell in
while playing.
   Hail as big as baseballs also crashed into the state and heavy
storm winds blew down several tents, interrupting the Jazz and
Heritage Festival in New Orleans for a day.
   ``We had a very dry April and we needed rain. We just didn't
need 11 inches in one night,'' said Ernest Ethridge of the National
Weather Service.
   The storms also lashed Texas and Oklahoma on Thursday night and
early Friday, leaving eight dead, mainly because of drowning.
   Farther north, record cold weather chilled the Midwest, where at
least 10 cities registered their lowest temperatures ever for May
6. Indianapolis had its first May snowfall in 29 years.
   The first deadly tornadoes hit Spartanburg County, S.C., Friday
evening.
   Clyde Hipp, 66, was killed when a chimney toppled onto him after
a twister touched down around 6:20 p.m., Deputy Coroner Richard
Seay said.
   Minnie Lee Hipp said she and her husband were listening to a
police radio when a tornado bulletin was issued. ``We heard the
tornado was coming through Boiling Springs, and my husband laid
down on the floor, and before we knew it, the chimney had fallen
and the roof was gone,'' she said.
   A woman died when storm winds picked up and threw her mobile
home, Seay said. Mark Kruea, a spokesman for the county Sheriff's
Department, said the body of an unidentified infant also was found,
but the coroner's office said it could not confirm that report.
   Debbie Rice of the county's Emergency Preparedness Division said
teams were expected today to survey damage in a 4-square-mile area.
At least 32 people were hospitalized at Spartanburg Regional
Medical Hospital and others were treated and released, she said.
   The storm cut power to as many as 39,000 people across the
state, spokesmen for South Carolina Electric and Gas Co. and Duke
Power Co. said.
   Tornadoes damaged an area about 25 miles long by two miles wide
in Cleveland and Lincoln counties in North Carolina, said Gene
Morrison of the Lawndale Rescue Squad.
   ``It was so quiet,'' said Mickey Brown, describing the funnel
cloud he saw approaching, ``then all hell broke loose.''
   At least 42 people were taken to hospitals for injuries,
officials said. Emergency shelters were opened at four schools, a
Masonic lodge and a supermarket.
   About 39,000 residents were without power across North Carolina,
including about 19,000 Duke Power customers in Durham.
   In Georgia, at least nine people were reported injured when a
tornado hit near Interstate 985 in Hall County, about 40 miles
northeast of Atlanta.
   ``We had at least two vehicles blown into the woods upside-down,
one van and one automobile,'' said Reggie Forrester, county public
safety director.
   A tornado also knocked steeples off three churches and wrecked
three stores in Toccoa, a few miles from the South Carolina border.
   Storms packed winds up to 90 mph and toppled a string of 89
high-voltage transmission towers from Tallulah, La., across the
Mississippi River to Vicksburg, Miss. Power was restored to most of
the 50,000 customers affected by outages by late Friday, Louisiana
Power &amp; Light Co. officials said.

<TEXT>
   John Zaccaro Jr. has appealed his cocaine
conviction to the state Supreme Court, claiming he was singled out
for prosecution because he is the son of former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Zaccaro was found guilty in April 1988 of selling one-quarter
gram of cocaine to an undercover agent while attending Middlebury
College in 1986. He already served a four-month sentence under
house arrest, but a successful appeal could wipe the felony
conviction from his record.
   The Supreme Court, which received the appeal late last month, is
awaiting a prosecution reply and is not expected to hear arguments
until September.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn said Zaccaro also is
appealing on other grounds related to his trial defense that he was
entrapped by the undercover officer, Laura Manning, at his
apartment.

   Faye Prater embraced the idea of
Japanese-style management and its benevolent attitude toward
workers when she went to work for Nissan at its new high-tech plant
six years ago.
   Today, she's on long-term disability at 60 percent of her pay,
having poor balance and headaches from being struck with a 50-pound
chunk of sheet metal. She says she expects to be fired when her
disability pay expires in December. Though the company says it has
no such plans, her case is being highlighted in a union organizing
campaign.
   ``I'm thoroughly for the union,'' Mrs. Prater, 47, said Tuesday
from her home in McMinnville.
   ``I'm like a lot of people down there. It's the best job they
ever had in their lives. Everybody down there loves everybody. But
if you ever get hurt, it's out the door. The people need a union.''
   The United Auto Workers is preparing to ask the National Labor
Relations Board to conduct an election to let 3,200 production
workers at Nissan Motor Manufacturing U.S.A.'s only plant decide
whether to join the union.
   The UAW has a mixed record at Japanese-owned auto plants in the
United States. The union withdrew its organizing petition at a
Honda plant in Marysville, Ohio. General Motors agreed to union
representation at its joint venture with Toyota in Freemont,
Calif., and the union represents workers at the Diamond Star plant,
a joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi in Bloomington, Ill.
   In Smyrna, the union is handing out fliers with the pictures and
stories of employees who say they are off the job because of
injuries.
   Mrs. Prater, who was injured more than 18 months ago, said
Nissan promised to find her a job performing lighter work than her
assembly-line job, but none has been offered yet.
   Rick Sommer, Nissan vice president for manufacturing and a
former Ford engineer, said a light-duty job should be waiting for
Mrs. Prater when she's ready to return.
   He would not say she absolutely will have such a job, but said,
``I can think of only two times where a person has not returned to
work in the eight years I've been here.''
   Maxey Irwin, a communications consultant hired by the UAW, was
much less optimistic.
   ``When people get hurt in that plant, there's no other place for
them to go. At a UAW-organized plant, there's other jobs for them
to do. But at this place, they give their bodies to Nissan, and
Nissan does not have a job for them,'' Irwin said.
   Union organizers portray Nissan managers as transplanted Detroit
executives who subscribe to antiquated management style and abuse
employees by continually speeding up the assembly line.
   Nissan says the Japanese participatory style of management,
which encourages worker involvement and teamwork with management,
does not include third parties like the UAW.
   The company says workers are happy with salaries that range from
$12.55 to $17.19 an hour and benefits that equal those of
UAW-organized auto plants.
   ``Nissan came in here with the Japanese style of management. But
Nissan's 15,000 miles away. The people who run this plant are old
Ford people,'' said Irwin.
   UAW organizers said they should be ready to file an organizing
petition with the NLRB in about two weeks, which could lead to an
election in June or July.
   Nissan says the organizing efforts are disruptive and the UAW
should speed up the process.
   ``We've had a number of questions from people who've been
badgered, even at home,'' Sommer said.
   The UAW has a national membership of just under 1 million, union
spokesman Frank Joyce of Detroit said. UAW membership peaked in
1979 at about 1.5 million. Since then, about 120,000 Canadian
members branched off to form the Canadian Auto Workers union. Joyce
blamed the rest of the losses on industrial cutbacks.
   Nissan announced an expansion April 3 that will add 2,000 jobs
and boost annual production to 440,000 cars and light pickup trucks
a year. The company says that would make the Smyrna plant the
nation's largest automobile production factory by 1992.

<HEAD>Crewman at Helm Says Captain Did Not Appear Drunk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The crewman at the helm of the Exxon Valdez
when it struck a reef in Alaska said the captain did not appear to
be drunk on the night the ship ran aground, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
   ``There was no indication there was anything wrong,'' Third Mate
Gregory Cousins told the Tampa Tribune in his first interview since
the March 24 accident.
   Cousins, who Exxon has said was operating the 987-foot ship when
it hit the charted reef, has been on leave at home in Tampa
preparing his testimony on the 10 million gallon crude oil spill
for a National Transportation Safety Board hearing May 16 in
Anchorage, Alaska.
   Cousins, who described ship Capt. Joseph Hazelwood as
``extremely competent,'' defended similar statements from other
crew members about Hazelwood's apparent sobriety when the tanker
grounded.
   ``It's not like we're circling the wagons. It's just the
truth,'' Cousins said.
   Hazelwood of Huntington, N.Y., was fired by Exxon when tests
conducted more than 10 hours after the accident showed a
blood-alcohol level above the .04 percent permitted under Coast
Guard regulations. He faces trial June 20 in Valdez on charges of
operating the vessel while drunk.
   Cousins, who was not certified to navigate Prince William Sound,
faces a Coast Guard review of his license and must testify at state
and federal trials resulting from the spill.
   The Associated Press was unable to reach Cousins on Saturday
because he has an unlisted telephone number.
   In the interview, he did not make specific comments on his role
during the accident. He told the newspaper he is eager to tell his
side of the story but his attorney has advised him to wait for the
NTSB hearing.
   ``I think all the pieces have been reported, but they haven't
been put together right,'' said Cousins, who was responsible for
safety and emergency equipment on the tanker.
   He spent two days after the accident in Valdez, listened to
public reaction and was disturbed about misperceptions about tanker
crews.
   ``It's a tragedy of some enormity. You can't blame people for
being outraged,'' he said. ``Emotions were running high.''
   Cousins called the spill damage sickening but said he believes
Exxon is doing all it can with cleanup ``no matter what anyone
says.''
   The oil has moved about 500 miles southwest of Valdez, fouling
the shore at the Katmai National Park wildlife refuge and other
areas.
   Cousins said the past six weeks have been stressful for him and
his wife, Michelle.
   ``We're trying to stabilize things around here. Michelle has
been harassed by constant questions,'' he said. ``She didn't know
what was going on those first few days. When I wasn't around, I was
very worried about her welfare.''

   Students at Beijing's most prestigious university
voted Saturday to continue a two-week class boycott for democratic
reforms, despite calls by protest leaders to drop the strike.
   The developments indicated that China's fledgling student
movement, the biggest in its 40-year history, faces serious
organizational problems.
   The United Association of Beijing Universities, an independent
group that has organized three weeks of demonstrations, urged that
students head back to class and continue their campaign through
``speeches, plays and pamphlets.''
   More than 70,000 Beijing students have been boycotting classes
since April 24, and students at many schools began returning to
class Friday following a huge protest at Tiananmen Square.
   But at Beijing University, students ignored the plea.
   Each dormitory room received a ballot, and the final tally was
865 rooms to 303 in favor of continuing the boycott, with more than
100 rooms abstaining. Each dormitory room sleeps six to eight
students.
   Some students at Beijing Normal University also said they would
stay out of school.
   Activists said they wanted to continue the strike because they
were not satisfied with the results of the student movement.
   ``We must continue to pressure the government and struggle until
the movement is victorious,'' said one student leader. ``The
government has given us nothing. They still call us illegal.''
   But members of the United Association said they were satisfied
with the results of the campaign and did not think it would be
possible to hold any new protests.
   ``The main thing we created was an atmosphere,'' said Wang
Zhixin, a student leader from the College of Politics and Law. ``We
have brought the word `democracy' into the lives of the people of
China.''
   Another student group representing at least 24 universities sent
an appeal to the government and ruling Communist Party on Saturday
for a dialogue on the students' demands for democracy and an end to
corruption.
   The two-page appeal was sent two days after Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang made a conciliatory call for dialogue.
   The new group, the Student Dialogue Representative group, was
formed after the government refused to meet with the United
Association, which it declared illegal.
   Also Saturday, The Legal Daily reported that a railway worker
was sentenced to death for participating in violence triggered by
an April 22 student march in Xian.
   The sentence was the first report of punishment meted out since
the demonstrations began April 15, after the death of ousted
Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang.
   The daily said Zhang Jun was on trial with 900 other people
accused of attacking government offices in Xian following a student
march. It did not say if anyone else was sentenced.

   Hanif Sutton never had a chance.
   His father was in jail. His mother had taken in a convicted drug
addict who allegedly forced her into prostitution. Neighbors
suspected Hanif was being beaten, but didn't speak up. And a state
social worker didn't detect any danger during repeated visits with
the boy and his mother.
   Hanif died last week at the age of 3{.
   Randolph Scott, who was living with Hanif and his mother,
Rosalyn Rochester, has been charged with the child's murder, and
with assault and battery of both Hanif and Rochester.
   ``I personally haven't ever handled anything so gruesome,'' said
Lowell Police Inspector David Tousignant. ``And all the veteran
detectives who have been here awhile, they say this is one of the
most horrifying cases they've seen.''
   Investigators say that Scott, 38, left prison in late January
and moved in with Rochester a short time later, forcing her into
prostitution to support his heroin habit, as he had done with
several women in the past.
   They shared a cramped, ramshackle house with four other families
in this former mill town of 90,000 just south of the New Hampshire
border.
   As time went on, authorities say, Scott's violence toward the
boy and his mother escalated. By the time of Hanif's death, police
said, the boy's back looked like leather from repeated beatings and
burns and there were three big bruises on his face.
   Scott told investigators that he hit the boy because he was
``wetting his pants and ... he was lazy,'' Tousignant said.
   Why didn't the 23-year-old mother get help? ``She was in total
fear of Scott, almost a paralyzing fear,'' said Tousignant.
   Tousignant said he found the case frustrating because so many
people had a chance to speak up and didn't.
   The only ones who tried were an anonymous tipster who complained
to authorities that the boy was not getting needed medical care,
and Hanif's 5-year-old cousin, who lived in the same building and
was Hanif's best friend.
   ``My son came running to me when I got home, crying `Mommy,
mommy, my cousin's getting hit too much!''' said the 5-year-old's
mother.
   ``He got hit with a belt buckle and a shoe,'' the boy said.
   The boy's warning to his mother came April 28, when the woman
returned home from a three-week jail term. The boy had stayed with
Hanif and his mother for two weeks while his own mother was in jail.
   That same day, another neighbor also saw Hanif's bruises.
Rochester told her that the boy fell out of bed. The woman said she
wanted to tell authorities about the beating, but was afraid of
Scott.
   ``It would have caused a lot of problems for me and my kids,''
she said. ``So I just told my boyfriend that I was going to mind my
own problems.''
   Actually, authorities already had been alerted about Hanif. The
state Department of Social Services had been checking on him since
February, after an anonymous tipster claimed the boy wasn't
receiving proper attention for an ear infection.
   A social worker first met with Rochester on Feb. 17 and reported
that she was making an effort to care for Hanif and that the boy
had visited a doctor. The social worker met with Hanif and his
mother six times, and the mother separately three times, according
to DSS spokeswoman Lorraine Carli.
   Rochester missed an appointment April 21. The social worker went
to her home April 27, but no one was home. By last weekend, it was
too late. Hanif was taken to the hospital at about 4:30 a.m. April
30 and died the following day.
   The autopsy showed Hanif died of blunt trauma to the head,
according to Tousignant. There also was evidence he may have been
sexually assaulted.
   The DSS was aware of Scott's drug use and had unverified
information about Rochester being a prostitute. Carli said the
department was concerned that Scott may have been abusing
Rochester, but had no indication that Hanif was being harmed except
for possibly being neglected.
   ``It's a very difficult dilemma on what's appropriate when
you're dealing with a family,'' Carli said. ``That's why the whole
system is set up so that people can make reports to us at any time
of the day.''
   Things seem more simple to Hanif's young cousin and his mother.
   ``I just say, `Thank God my kid got out of there,''' the mother
said.

   Michelle Fowler's prom date was 48
years older than she is, but the Stonewall Jackson High senior
didn't mind.
   Fowler, 17, took her grandfather, 65-year-old John Samuels, to
the prom Friday night, saying it was an appropriate way both to
express her love for him and to mark the school's final prom.
   ``I feel honored that he would go with me,'' Fowler said. ``I
thought he'd say no. I thought he wouldn't want to go with a bunch
of high school kids.''
   Stonewall Jackson is merging with Charleston High this summer to
form Capital High.
   Samuels is a 1941 Stonewall Jackson graduate who did not attend
his senior prom. However, he traveled from Florida to West Virginia
for Friday night's four-hour prom cruise aboard the West Virginia
Belle sternwheeler.
   ``I was in the first graduating class, and she thought it would
be something by her being in the last,'' Samuels said of his
granddaughter, to whom he gave his 1941 class ring last summer.
   ``Grandpa was really good to me as I was growing up,'' Fowler
said. ``We were always really good friends _ not just granddaughter
and grandpa. I'd rather go with him than some ol' guy.
   The couple made all the proper prom plans.
   ``I rented a tux and she got a dress,'' Samuels said. ``I
ordered the flowers.''
   The only thing that worried Samuels was his dancing ability.
   ``I told her to get a backup, but she still wanted me to go with
her,'' he said. ``I couldn't shake and rattle like these kids can
today.''

   The first of the new Biloxi schooner
sailboats is in the water, bringing back memories of the vessels
that once turned the Mississippi Coast city into the
self-proclaimed Seafood Capital of the World.
   Eighty-seven-year-old Glenn Swetman smiled broadly as the boat
that carries his name plunged into Back Bay on Friday from a
boatyard in D'Iberville, across the bay from here.
   The sailboat was named for him because his bank made a large
contribution to the private effort to bring back the era of sailing
schooners here. Eventually, the 68-foot, two-masted Glenn L.
Swetman will be joined by a second, as-yet-unnamed schooner.
   In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the schooners
harvested Gulf shrimp and oysters, and raced one another in the
off-seasons.
   Both the seafood title and the fishing fleets became victims of
change when motorized boats began scooping up a depleting bounty,
and schooners largely disappeared by the 1930s.
   The Glenn L. Swetman won't be scooping up shrimp and oysters,
but it will race and earn its keep as a charter and educational
boat.
   The schooner project, begun in 1986, and a seafood industry
museum are part of an effort to revive the Biloxi waterfront.
   ``Now this is true progress with preservation _ bringing back
historic boats as a symbol of our revival,'' said Biloxi Mayor
Gerald Blessey as he watched the schooner slip into the water. ``We
are already getting requests for charters for this boat, even for
convention parties.''
   Numerous fund-raisers, private contributions and an $80,000 bank
loan have footed the bill for the $200,000 schooner.

<HEAD>Strike By Polish Copper Miners Enters Its Second Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper workers from the official trade
union alliance and from Solidarity struck four mines in
southwestern Poland for a second day Saturday to demand higher pay.
   Jan Sugalski, a local Solidarity activist, said the miners were
demanding a 50 percent pay increase. He said they earn $118 to $176
a month.
   Sugalski said the miners formed a strike committee of
representatives from the official trade union alliance, OPZZ, and
the recently legalized Solidarity union. Talks between the
committee and management have so far failed to settle the strike,
the state news agency PAP said.
   A seven-year ban on Solidarity was lifted April 17 under an
agreement the opposition and communist authorities reached during
broad-based talks that were held after a serious wave of strikes
last year.
   Workers were striking at the Lubin, Polkowice, Rudna and
Sieroszowice mines near the city of Lubin, 200 miles southwest of
Warsaw, Sugalski and PAP said.
   Sugalski said more than 20,000 miners joined the strike, which
began Friday morning. PAP said the miners struck the morning shift
and were joined by workers on the afternoon shift. PAP gave no
figures on the number of strikers.
   Sugalski said the striking miners remained on the surface of the
pits and were carrying out maintenance underground.
   On Friday, the strikers handed over a list of demands, all of
which concerned pay, and they were rejected by management, he said.

<HEAD>In New York, A Scathing Report On Child Services</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In New York City, where atrocities against
children have been the stuff of headlines for two years, officials
have twice confirmed the obvious: There is a crisis in services for
victimized kids.
   In one report issued last week, state Social Services
Commissioner Cesar Perales found that child welfare workers often
mishandled investigations and failed to monitor troubled families.
He also faulted the way children were placed in foster homes and
accused the city of sloppy record-keeping, poor supervision and
unclear policies.
   A day later, the Human Resources Administration _ the city's
child welfare agency _ issued its own report which made many of the
same criticisms. In at least three cases, said the report, children
died in 1988 in households that should have been visited frequently
by social workers but were not.
   In 1988, according to a city panel, 127 children may have died
of abuse or neglect. Of those, 58 or nearly half were previously
known to child welfare authorities. The panel said 18 of the deaths
led to sanctions against welfare workers ranging from warnings and
memos to resignations.
   A series of much-publicized horrors have made child welfare an
issue in the city's current mayoral campaign.
   The first was the killing of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg in
November 1987. Police and school officials were scored for failing
to notice that the girl had been abused; the man who adopted her
illegally, Joel Steinberg, was convicted of manslaughter earlier
this year.
   The state's examination of how the city handled child-abuse
cases was prompted by the beating death last December of Jessica
Cortez, a 5-year-old whose case was known to welfare workers for
some time. The girl's mother and her boyfriend have been charged in
the death.
   The state report said children taken from their parents were
shuttled from office to office, bedded on cots, placed in
inappropriate settings and separated from their brothers and
sisters.
   The state report also alleged that there were instances when
welfare workers did not look up records even though they knew the
records existed; when there were no visits to homes in which child
abuse had been reported; and when families did not receive
counseling or other services ordered by Family Court judges.
   In one case, the agency didn't even know that a child had frozen
to death in a family's unheated house, the report said.
   But the report asserted that ``many of the problems encountered
by child protective workers today are really beyond their
mandate,'' particularly escalating drug use by parents.

<HEAD>Iowa To Return to Sea Duty Before Turret Repair, Pentagon Sources
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battleship Iowa will be returned to sea
duty next month while still awaiting repairs on its badly damaged
No. 2 turret, defense officials said Saturday.
   The officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,
indicated the Iowa would serve a normal tour, of four to six
months, in the Northern Atlantic and Mediterranean before being
returned stateside for repair of the turret next winter.
   Aside from the disabled turret, where an explosion killed 47
sailors during practice firing on April 19, ``the ship is sound,''
said one official. ``Don't forget,'' he added, ``she's still got
two other turrets of three 16-inch guns and a whole mess of cruise
missiles.''
   In addition to their big guns, the Iowa and three sister
battleships, the Wisconsin, the Missouri and the New Jersey, each
bear 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles, capable of carrying nuclear
warheads 1,000 miles, as well as four 20mm anti-missile guns and 16
Harpoon missiles than can hit ships up to 60 miles away.
   While declining, as usual, to specify dates of the Iowa's new
tour, officials said the ship likely would leave its home port, at
Norfolk, Va., next month.
   The ship could use its two other turrets, as well as other
weapons systems, if it became involved in hostilities, but a
moratorium against test-firing the 16-inch guns remains in effect
until the Navy determines the cause of the accident, the officials
noted. The moratorium, decreed by Adm. Carlisle A. H. Trost,
applies to the three other World War II-vintage battleships as well
as the Iowa.
   The officials said the decision to return the Iowa to sea before
repairing the No. 2 turret, at an estimated cost of $15 million to
$20 million, was made to avoid disrupting normal fleet schedules as
well as shipyard schedules.
   To begin the repairs now, they said, would force costly delays
on work scheduled for other ships. By sending the Iowa to sea, with
the damaged turret sealed, the Navy will be better able to plan for
the repair of the battleship, including the determination of which
shipyard is best suited for the work.
   That also will enable officials to seek regular appropriations
from Congress next fiscal year for the repairs, rather than dipping
into an already-depleted discretionary account for the Atlantic
Fleet, they noted.
   After the explosion, which occurred during a training exercise
330 miles northeast of Puerto Rico, the Navy said at first that it
did not know whether it could find either the parts of the
technicians to fix the guns, which are nearly 50 years old. Since
then, however, chief Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard has
said the Navy was satisfied the job could be done for $15 million
to $20 million, despite estimates of some private experts that
ranged as high as $100 million.

<TEXT>
   Kidnappers have threatened to kill a West
German hostage unless a court grants a light sentence to a Lebanese
hijacker in West Germany and Cyprus frees another terrorist, a PLO
official said Saturday.
   West Germany initially had been skeptical of the kidnapping
claim but said Saturday it was convinced it was dealing with a
hostage crisis.
   The missing West German reportedly is one of three who
Palestinian officials say were abducted Thursday by unidentified
kidnappers. Two of the West Germans turned up safe Friday, and the
Palestinians said they had been freed by the kidnappers.
   The life of the man still held is in danger unless a West German
court grants a lenient sentence to Mohammed Ali Hamadi and Cyprus
frees within 10 days a Lebanese man supposedly jailed there, said
Lt. Co. Wajih Abu Ali, head of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's military police in Sidon.
   Abu Ali said the two freed Germans, Heinrich Struebig, 48, and
Petra Schnitzler, 26, told him of the kidnappers' demands during a
meeting at the Mieh Mieh Palestinian refugee camp.
   ``They told me that they were asked in English by their five
kidnappers to transmit their demands to the Bonn government and the
Cypriot authorities,'' he said.
   Palestinian officers have identified the missing man as Markus
Michael, 25. The West German television network ZDF identified him
as Markus Quint, 24, and West Germany's ARD television identified
him as 21-year-old Markus Quient.
   He and the other two West Germans work for the ASME-Humanitas
humanitarian organization, which delivers medical aid to the Sidon
region. Palestinian officers say they were abducted on the
outskirts of Sidon.
   Abu Ali said Struebig and Schnitzler identified the Lebanese
held in Cyrpus as Amin Sahour, a Shiite Moslem Lebanese.
   Cypriot authorities had no comment on the demand.
   Official lists of Arab prisoners on the Mediterranean island do
not include Amin Sahour. But a Lebanese man named Amin Zaarour was
sentenced in September 1987 to seven years in jail after a suitcase
full of grenades was found in his apartment.
   ``I asked them if the kidnappers have said what they would do if
their demands were not met,'' Abu Ali said. ``They told me that the
kidnappers said that Michael's life will be threatened.''
   Hamadi, a 23-year-old Shiite Moslem, is on trial in Frankfurt on
air piracy and murder charges in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA
airline to Beirut. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was slain during
the ordeal. A verdict is expected this month.
   West Germany's ambassador to Lebanon, Wolfgangf Gottelmann, met
Saturday in Moslem west Beirut with acting Prime Minister Salim
Hoss, who heads the Moslem Cabinet in Lebanon's splintered
government.
   Afterward, Gottelmann said: ``All I can say is that two German
citizens had disappeared and they've shown up again after a short
while.
   ``They confirmed that a third German citizen is still missing
and we're confident he also will show up,'' Gottelmann said.
   In Bonn, a West German official said the government has had no
direct contact with the kidnappers but said it no longer is
skeptical an abduction took place.
   ``We have to conclude now that a West German indeed has been
kidnapped,'' said a Foreign Ministry official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity.
   There are 15 foreigners known to be held hostage in Lebanon,
including nine Americans. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest-held of the
captives. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   ``I know you have an interest in our sewer system,'' Daley told
Letterman, referring to remote-camera footage from inside the
city's sewer system that was featured on Letterman's show earlier
in the week.
   Letterman accepted the metal, saying, ``Oh, a little heavy
there.''
   He welcomed the new mayor, who took office last month, on stage
by telling him how much he enjoyed having the show broadcast from
Chicago.
   The ``people of Chicago are nice, automatically nice,
automatically friendly, polite, that the city is apparently
thriving, that it's clean, and that it's relatively safe ... .''
   Daley finally broke in: ``Are you running for mayor?''

   There are no more wasted days or wasted
nights for Freddy Fender, the country music singer says, now that
he has kicked drugs and alcohol and started work on reviving his
career.
   ``For the last 3{ years, I've been hellbent ... trying to catch
up after 10 years of drugs and alcohol,'' Fender said Friday in an
interview with The Springfield News-Leader. ``We're working very
hard on getting there.''
   Fender, who is performing six nights a week in the 800-seat
theater at the Kirkwood Inn, said he was driven to drugs and
alcohol at the height of his success in the 1970s.
   ``Fame can kill you,'' he said. ``Fame has killed a lot of
artists. The big one is the drugs and alcohol. For some reason,
it's so natural.''
   Fender's single ``Before the Next Teardrop Falls'' reached No. 1
on the charts in 1975. He followed with ``Wasted Days and Wasted
Nights,'' becoming one of the major country stars of the 1970s to
find a mainstream audience.
   He said he didn't start to recuperate until his wife obtained a
court order four years ago to commit him to a treatment center.
   His first recording in eight years, ``Spanish Harlem,'' is to be
released this spring by Critique-Atlantic Records. He is also cast
in ``Desperado,'' an upcoming NBC miniseries.

   Comedian Jerry Lewis' 38-year-old wife,
who was two months pregnant, has lost the child, Lewis' manager
said Saturday.
   Sandi Lewis was examined Thursday by a Los Angeles doctor who
conducted a sonogram test that revealed the baby's heart was not
beating, manager Joe Stabile said.
   Mrs. Lewis is recuperating at the couple's Las Vegas home.
   Lewis, 63, learned that his wife was pregnant a month ago during
a break in a show at the Olympia Theater in Paris, and he told
audience he was going to be ``a proud papa.''
   The two have been married six years and have no children.

   Steven Ford, the newest member of the
National Cowboy Hall of Fame's board of directors, remembers the
day he told his father, then-President Ford, he wanted to go west
and become a cowboy.
   ``I had never even really ridden a horse,'' Ford said Friday,
``and it was probably the silliest thing ever said in the Oval
Office. But we worked out a deal where if I didn't make it, I would
go back to school the next year.
   ``I just look back and say, `It was the best decision I ever
made.'''
   Ford worked after high school on a Utah ranch and studied animal
science at California Polytechnical University.
   He got into acting because ``when I was 21, 22, I had some
friends who needed someone who could fall off a horse, so I went to
do some work in the movie `Cattle Annie and Little Britches,''' he
said during a tour of the Cowboy Hall.
   Ford, 32, said he is taking a year off from acting after seven
years on the soap opera ``The Young and The Restless.''
   He will represent the state of California on the hall's board of
directors.

   Comedian Jonathan Winters may be serious
about artistic painting, but not that serious.
   ``There's much more to it than having paints, a large bottle of
vodka and a TV set locked on the `Days of Our Lives,''' said
Winters, who was in San Francisco Saturday to receive a doctor of
humane letters degree from the Academy of Art College.
   But consider some of the wacky titles he's chosen for some of
his work.
   ``Pathetic Black Moon with Awful Vase with Dead Flowers in It,''
is what Winters called a ``put-on of a large white canvas with a
little red dot on its center that the Museum of Modern Art in New
York paid 200 grand for.''
   Then there's ``Two Birds Watching Doris Day's Cat and Dog
Drown.'' Winters said that while Day is involved in various animal
protection causes, the painting has nothing to do with her.
Instead, it's ``just my black humor at work.''
   Winters, 63, studied art at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, and
the Dayton Art Institute. He holds a bachelor of fine arts degree
from Dayton.

   Communist firebrand Boris N. Yeltsin said Saturday
more than one person could be considered for the Soviet presidency,
but he shied away from declaring himself a candidate to face the
most likely contender, his one-time supporter, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Congress of People's Deputies, the parliament to which
Yeltsin was elected by a landslide, meets May 25 to choose a
president from among its 2,250 members.
   If past Communist Party practice holds, Gorbachev, the current
president and Communist Party general-secretary, will be the only
candidate.
   But in an interview, the 58-year-old Yeltsin did not discount
the possibility of alternative candidates.
   ``There could be other suggestions from deputies,'' he said. But
indicating the opponents might not make it past the stage of
preliminary discussion, he added: ``That doesn't mean there will be
a vote among several alternative candidates.''
   Yeltsin would not say who he would like to see run against
Gorbachev.
   ``We'll wait for the session,'' he said. He has said repeatedly
he does not consider himself a candidate.
   In late April, there were indications some Moscow deputies
planned to propose an alternative candidate. But after meeting with
Gorbachev on Wednesday, one of those deputies, Mikhail Bocharov,
said nominating anyone but the Kremlin chief would be ``silly.''
   Gorbachev has been party general-secretary since March 1985 and
president since Oct. 1. He supports multiple-candidate elections
such as the March 26 parliamentary vote but has not said whether
the presidential race should be contested.
   There is token official opposition to Gorbachev, who was
rejected by 12 of the 641 policy-making Central Committee members
and alternates in his bid to join the new congress. He was among a
slate of Communist Party officials who were simply chosen rather
than elected to the parliament.
   Gorbachev brought Yeltsin into the Soviet leadership in 1985,
but the two quarreled after Yeltsin criticized the slow pace of
political reforms. Yeltsin was ousted as Moscow party chief and
dropped as a non-voting Politburo member.
   Under constitutional amendments approved in November, the vote
for president will be conducted in secret. The Congress will also
elect 542 of its members to the Supreme Soviet, a full-time
legislature.
   Yeltsin reiterated that the people should have a say in setting
rules for the presidential election.
   ``Let the people determine who the chairman will be, and not
2,250 deputies,'' Yeltsin said.
   As for his own political future, Yeltsin said he should be
chosen for the Supreme Soviet because of his popularity. He won his
Moscow parliamentary race with 90 percent of the vote.
   ``No one had so many voters, almost 6 million ... and that must
be considered, although my personality will also be considered,''
he said.
   The Communist Party has branded Yeltsin politically immature,
but he said hundreds of deputies support him.

<HEAD>``For Dan Quayle, No News is Good News,'' Says Trip Analyst</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle emerged from his
latest on-the-job training trip relatively unscathed by public
criticism, happy about his personal contact with world leaders and
insisting he is ready to make a difference in foreign affairs.
   Returning to the nation's capital Friday after 12 days in which
he saw Australia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand, Quayle said
information he garnered abroad will help him play a role in
formulating policies in the Bush administration.
   Even though ``I don't sign treaties,'' Quayle said, ``I
guarantee you what I learned on this trip ... will help make
policy.'' One area in which he is expected to have input involves
Cambodia where Vietnamese troops are scheduled to end their
decade-long occupation Sept. 30.
   Quayle said his second foreign excursion as vice president _ his
first was in February to Venezuela and El Salvador _ gave him an
understanding of a range of issues as well as the personalities who
shape them.
   ``I am now in personal contact with those leaders,'' he said.
   The trip was full of exotic photo opportunities: Quayle mingling
with sarong-clad women Pago Pago; Quayle golfing with Singapore's
deputy prime minister; Quayle in a coverall touring an oil-slick
beach in Alaska; Quayle cuddling Cambodian refugees in a camp six
miles from the Thai-Cambodian border.
   He even tried scuba diving on Australia's Great Barrier Reef.
   The vice president's tour bore similarities to one President
Bush made in the spring of 1982 when he was vice president. Bush
visited Australia, Singapore, Japan, South Korea and China.
   But Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the
University of Virginia, said Quayle's trip was more important for
him because Bush already had wide experience in foreign affairs
when he became vice president.
   Bush was a former head of the CIA, ambassador to the United
Nations and chief U.S. liaison officer to China, a rank tantamount
to ambassador, during the establishment of full diplomatic
relations with the communist nation.
   Quayle is a former senator from Indiana with limited experience
in foreign affairs, although he is well-versed in defense policy.
   Before the recent trip, Japan was the only Pacific country
Quayle had visited.
   Sabato said trips like Quayle's are crucial to expand his
breadth of knowledge and let Americans, particularly the vice
president's conservative Republican supporters, know he can handle
himself as a diplomat.
   ``This is on-the-job training,'' Sabato said. Such trips help
Quayle as long as he doesn't make any major mistakes, he said.
``For Dan Quayle, no news is good news.''
   Abroad as at home, Quayle attracts interest, Sabato said, from
people who want to know whether he's really the way Democratic
opponents portrayed him as in the 1988 election campaign: a
wet-behind-the-ears, good-natured sports buff without the
intellectual facilities necessary to lead the largest nation in the
free world.
   ``He's viewed as a curiosity,'' Sabato said.
   Nowhere was more attention paid to Quayle than in Australia,
where he had a well-publicized run-in with officials over subsidies
the United States pays to its wheat farmers. The Australians say
price supports hurt their exports abroad; Quayle says they don't,
and besides, they're aimed at protectionist policies in Europe, not
Australia.
   ``It's a very sensitive issue with the Australians,'' the vice
president said.
   In a column in the Sydney Morning News the day after Quayle
arrived, Tony Stephens wrote that Quayle apparently had chosen to
visit Australia because it was a friendly nation.
   ``The rationale for this piece of diplomacy was Mr. Quayle's
bumbling effort in the presidential campaign,'' he wrote, ``Now,
however, Mr. Quayle is apparently growing into his job.''
   Another writer _ in the national newspaper The Australian _ said
the Australian national press corps ``clearly enjoyed Mr. Quayle's
brand of humor'' in an appearance at Canberra's National Press Club.
   Australia was the place Quayle said he would have liked more
time, particularly Canberra, the capital. There, Quayle, a
self-described member of a ``new generation'' of world leaders,
said he enjoyed seeing contemporaries like 40-year-old Defense
Minister Kim Beazley.
   The vice president acknowledged he played down his ``new
generation'' theme in Thailand and Indonesia, two countries with a
layer of older leaders.
   In Indonesia, Quayle met with human rights activists but
refrained from publicly criticizing President Suharto on the issue.
   In Singapore, Quayle said he had a ``long and profound''
discussion with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew about press freedom and
human rights in that small, bustling city-state.
   In Jakarta, Indonesia, Quayle highlighted his talks with Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, a former Cambodian head of state who resides
there. Sihanouk, leader of the non-communist resistance, is favored
by Washington to lead a transition government in Cambodia. The
United States is weighing whether to give him military aid.
   Meantime, Quayle's aides are planning his next foreign foray,
possibly to Africa in the fall. Quayle said he also wants to see
more of Latin America.

<HEAD>Flowers Soaked With Deadly Gas Fells 60 Workers, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flowers thrown by people mourning the violent
demonstrations in Soviet Georgia apparently absorbed a harmful gas
used to crush the protests, and 60 clean-up workers had to be
hospitalized, a newspaper said Saturday.
   Some of the workers who picked up the strewn flowers were
comatose, the Communist youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   The newspaper said the incident was the third in which people
were reported harmed by residue from the gas used by security
forces during the April 9 riots in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
   At least 19 people died in the demonstrations. Witnesses said
authorities used shovels, clubs and gas to stop the unrest. Another
person later was shot to death for violating a curfew.
   There have been numerous conflicting reports about the nature of
the gas, which has not been identified but has been blamed for at
least two deaths and for nervous system disorders to hundreds of
people.
   Communist Party leaders in the republic were ousted after the
much-criticized decision to send troops against the
pro-independence demonstrators.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman,
said last week that a Kremlin commission investigating the clash
identified one component of the gas as a chemical known in the West
as CS, an incapacitating agent.
   Almost 500 Georgians have been treated for chemical poisoning,
the weekly Moscow News reported last week.
   International Red Cross doctors were en route to Tbilisi on
Saturday to help treat victims of the gas poisoning because local
doctors have been unable to find a cure, the local news agency,
Gruzinform, said.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said 230 people were hospitalized,
including eight in serious condition.
   The newspaper, under the headline, ``Find a Clear Answer,'' said
``millions'' of flowers strewn by people mourning the dead in
Tbilisi apparently absorbed the gas and that 60 maintenance workers
became ill and were hospitalized while making preparations for a
permanent memorial to the dead.
   ``Such chemical compounds which caused these particular symptoms
have already been found at a school and a theater institute located
not far from the square,'' the newspaper said. ``And now, in
flowers.''
   It did not say when the workers were hospitalized.
   The newspaper called on officials to reveal the name of the gas
so doctors can treat the injured.
   A deputy chief military prosecutor involved in the investigation
indicated in an Izvestia article that some chemicals remain
unidentified.
   ``It is necessary to find out what additives were used together
with the CS gas,'' Vladimir Vasilyev told Izvestia.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, in Tbilisi with
another investigative panel, told reporters at the local airport he
supports Red Cross help, activist Sergei Dandurov said in a
telephone interview from Tbilisi.
   Izvestia said Sakharov and other commission members met Thursday
with Georgia's health minister, and Dandurov said they visited the
injured in a hospital on Friday.
   In another development, about 1,000 Georgian women gathered
Friday night on the site of the April 9 demonstration to demand
that authorities take stronger action to treat gas poisoning
victims, Dandurov said.

   Syrian and Christian gunners plunged into
heavy artillery duels across Beirut and in nearby hills Saturday,
shattering a 9-day-old truce. Police said 10 people died and 33
were wounded.
   Shells rained on residential districts in Beirut's Moslem and
Christian sectors, on the city's port, around the Christian
enclave's northern coastline, and in summer resort towns in the
central mountains above the capital.
   Police said seven civilians, including a pregnant woman, were
killed and 22 wounded in west Beirut. Three were killed and 11
wounded in Christian east Beirut.
   The latest violence brought the overall death toll to 288 since
the latest round of fighting broke out March 8 between Christian
army units under Lebanese army commander Gen. Michel Aoun and an
alliance of Syrian and Druse Moslem militiamen.
   Another 1,044 have been wounded, according to police count.
   A police spokesman said casualty figures from bombarded
districts outside the city's municipal boundaries were not
immediately available.
   The duels crushed a cease-fire brokered nine days ago by the
Arab League. It was the fourth such cease-fire in two months.
   Since the latest truce was declared, rockets had been fired at
the Christian enclave, but Aoun's forces had not returned fire.
   Police said they struck back after nightfall Saturday, opening
up with a heavy barrage of 155mm artillery fire.
   Tens of thousands of residents stunned by the sudden escalation
scurried to basements and underground bunkers as Syrian gunners
opened up with multi-barreled rocket launchers that fire 40 rockets
a minute.
   ``All hell has broken loose all over again,'' said Rita Azar, a
Christian woman reached by telephone in the bunker of her apartment
building in suburban Zalka. ``I've stuffed my baby's ears with
cotton.''
   At the early stages of Saturday's shelling, the
Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio station said
sarcastically: ``On the occasion of Eid el-Fitr, the Syrians are
sending us their well wishes in the form of intensified
bombardment.''
   The three-day feast of Eid el-Fitr, which began Saturday, marks
the end of Ramadan, Islam's holy month.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a mainly Moslem
Cabinet vying for legitimacy against a Christian Cabinet under
Aoun, ``discussed the sudden deterioration'' in a telephone call to
Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi in Tunis, said a
statement from Hoss' office.
   ``Premier Hoss appealed to Secretary-General klibi to speed up
the dispatch of the Arab observer force to enforce and monitor the
cease-fire,'' it said.
   The Arab League had agreed to send in a 321-man force to monitor
the truce.
   The observer units, drawn from Kuwait, Tunisia, Algeria, Jordan,
Sudan and North Yemen, were expected to be airlifted to Beirut late
next week, according to media reports.
   Druse and Moslems have declared they will stop shelling the
Christian coastline when the observer force is deployed along
confrontation lines in Beirut and the hills to the east.
   The coastal stretch is the only escape route from the besieged
310-square-mile Christian enclave, where about 1 million Christians
live.
   The Druse and Moslem gunners also have demanded that observers
be stationed at the main Christian port of Jounieh and the city of
Byblos to guard against Iraqi arms shipments to Aoun.
   Iraq is Syria's main arab foe. It expressed support for Aoun
when he declared in March his ``war of liberation'' against Syria,
which maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Aoun has denied receiving arms from Iraq. He also agreed to lift
a blockade he imposed March 6 on illegal ports run by Moslem
militiamen. It was that blockade that ignited the latest round of
bloodshed in the 14-year-old civil war.

<HEAD>Hungarian Radio Broadcasts Speech Nagy Made In 1956</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time since Hungary's 1956
anti-Soviet revolt, official radio on Saturday broadcast a speech
Premier Imre Nagy made while Red Army soldiers and tanks crushed
the uprising.
   The broadcast was seen as another step in a reassessment of that
period in Hungary's history and the show trial that led to Nagy's
execution in 1958.
   The emotional speech Nagy gave on national radio on Nov. 4,
1956, informed his people that Soviet forces had entered Budapest
to put down the revolt.
   ``At dawn today, Soviet forces began an attack on our capital,
obviously with the aim of toppling the legal, democratic Hungarian
government,'' Nagy said in the speech broadcast again Saturday. His
voice trembling with emotion, he said: ``Our troops are fighting.
The government is in place. I am making this fact known to our
people and the whole world.''
   That same day, Nagy took refuge in the Yugoslav Embassy. Weeks
later, he and his associates were kidnapped by the Soviets and held
in Romania until brought back to Hungary and executed in June
1958.''
   Recently, Hungary's revolt against Stalinism and Soviet rule and
Nagy's role as its leader have been examined with more sympathy.
Politburo reformer Imre Pozsgay declared in January that the revolt
was a ``popular uprising,'' and communist authorities opened up the
archives to historians.
   On June 16, the anniversary of his execution, thousands of
Hungarians are expected to attend the reburial of Nagy and his
associates in a corner of a Budapest cemetery where the bodies have
lain in unmarked graves since 1958.
   The broadcast Saturday of Nagy's speech came in a morning
broadcast on Radio Kossuth. Scholar Maria Ormos had just given a
summary of a discussion held Friday by historians. They called for
opening the archives on the 1953-58 period, and they blamed Soviet
interference for the failure of the revolt and for the failure of a
1953 attempt at reform.
   After the interview, the radio mentioned several new
publications on the 1956 period, including a compilation of the
text of radio broadcasts by Nagy and his supporters during the
short-lived 1956 revolt. The collection is edited by Janos Kenedi,
a well-known member of Hungary's democratic opposition.
   Kenedi told Radio Kossuth the material was collected by Radio
Free Europe and published abroad but would now appear for the first
time in Hungary.
   The radio then closed out the broadcast with the Nagy speech,
which has been broadcast on the U.S.-funded, Munich-based RFE every
Nov. 4 for years in memory of the end of the 1956 revolt.
   The sweeping revision of Hungarian history began after the
ouster in May of Janos Kadar as Communist Party chief. Kadar took
over as Hungarian leader after the revolt was crushed. His role in
the uprising has never been clear, and he has refused to give a
public accounting of those days.
   Kadar, 76, is said to be too ill to carry out official duties as
honorary chairman of the party, a post created when he was replaced
as party chief last year by Karoly Grosz.
   Unconfirmed reports say that Kadar is unhappy about the recent
discussion of 1956 and the gradual rehabilitation of Nagy. A new
biography of Nagy is selling briskly and his picture appears on
lapel pins sold in Budapest kiosks.

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former military dictator is the
front-runner in elections Sunday to choose a president for this
largely Indian nation plagued by poverty and drugs.
   More than 2 million Bolivians are to choose from among nine
candidates vying to replace President Victor Paz Estenssoro, who is
retiring at age 81.
   Most polls have placed former dictator Gen. Hugo Banzer Suarez
of the rightist Nationalist Democratic Action in front, with
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of the conservative Revolutionary
Nationalist Movement competing for second place with Jaime Paz
Zamora of the Social Democratic Movement of the Revolutionary Left.
   Six other candidates were expected to garner only a small
percentage of the vote.
   Voters also will choose representatives for all 27 senate seats
and all 130 house seats.
   On Saturday, multcolored ballots were being distributed at the
more than 8,000 polling places across the nation of 6.7 million
people. The large single-sheet ballots bear party colors to help
the 37 percent of Bolivians who are illiterate cast votes.
   ``It is being carried out in a well-organized and transparent
manner,'' said Estela Rios de Jurada of El Salvador, one of more
than 20 foreign observers in Bolivia for the vote.
   Herman Antelo, Bolivia's information minister, said the
elections demonstrate the country's political maturity.
   It was likely, however, that the final word on who would be the
next president would come from the new congress when it convenes
Aug. 4.
   Under the constitution, a candidate must win an absolute
majority to become president by popular vote. If no candidate wins
more than 35 percent of the vote, congress can choose among the top
three. Polls indicated no candidate would win more than 35 percent.
   Banzer finished first in the last presidential election in 1985,
with 28.6 percent of the vote, but congress picked the second-place
finisher, Paz Estenssoro, who received 26.4 percent.
   Banzer seized power in a bloody coup in 1971 that toppled a
leftist military dictatorship. He ruled until 1978, when popular
pressure obliged him to call elections. The Bolivian Rights
Assembly says that during Banzer's government there were political
murders, 78 disappearences, and 14,537 illegal detentions.
   Sanchez de Lozada, a University of Chicago philosophy graduate,
promised to create 250,000 new jobs and 150,000 new dwellings. He
was planning minister under Paz Estenssoro and one of the
architects of an economic stabilization program that lowered
inflation from 24,000 percent four years ago to 2 percent for the
first quarter of this year.
   Few differences have emerged during the campaign. All the
candidates have pledged to continue the economic measures, though
their social cost has been high. They included the firing of 35,000
state-contracted miners and other public workers. Unemployment is
at 23 percent and the monthly minimum wage is $45.
   The candidates also pledged to continue the government's war on
cocaine production and trafficking, a flourishing illegal industry
that brings in $200 million to $300 million a year, according to
government estimates. Legal exports are expected to bring in only
$600 million this year.
   An estimated 300,000 Bolivians depend on coca leaf farming,
cocaine processing or trafficking for their livelihood, government
figures show. Coca leaves are the raw ingredient in cocaine.
   Paz Estenssoro's government has relied heavily on U.S.
assistance in its war on drugs. The United States provides about
$10 million yearly for drug programs, 50 military trainers, drug
enforcement agents and border patrol police.

<HEAD>New Round of Armenian Protest Breaks Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armenians have launched a new wave of protests to
demand annexation of a disputed enclave and freedom for activists
arrested in ethnic unrest, residents and officials said Saturday.
   A strike beginning Wednesday closed all businesses in
Stepanakert, the administrative center of the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh area, said Valery A. Sidorov, a government
official there. Only medical clinics, food-processing plants, and
the power station remained open, he said in a telephone interview.
   The strikers are demanding that authorities in Moscow reconsider
their January decision to place Nagorno-Karabakh under Kremlin
control, Sidorov said. The strikers, who are mostly ethnic
Armenians, want to wrest the region from Azerbaijan and incorporate
it into the neighboring Armenian republic.
   The region in the Caucasus Mountains in the southwestern Soviet
Union has been part of Azerbaijan since 1923. Armenians, who make
up three-quarters of the region's 162,000 people, say they suffer
discrimination by Azerbaijanis.
   Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh and the Armenian Republic carried
out strikes and demonstrations through most of last year until the
earthquake in December that killed an estimated 25,000 people. More
than 90 people were killed in the ethnic unrest.
   Sidorov said a group of local party officials wrote an open
letter published in the Nagorno-Karabakh press asking for a meeting
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss the dispute.
   Rafael Popoyan, an activist in Yerevan, said people also went on
strike to protest reports that the official in charge of
Nagorno-Karabakh, Arkady Volsky, ordered that more ethnic
Azerbaijanis be settled in the region. They now comprise 23 percent
of the region's population.
   However, Sidorov said there has been no influx of Azerbaijanis
and that Armenians instead have been moving to the area.
   Two residents reported that a crowd of Armenians formed in
Yerevan, the Armenian capital, on Saturday night to demand that
authorities free 11 activists. The prisoners belong to the Karabakh
Committee, which spearheaded the drive for Nagorno-Karabakh's
alliance with Armenia.
   The activists were arrested in December, but authorities have
not announced any charges against them.
   Silva Arutunyan, an Armenian poet who went to the gathering,
estimated the crowd at 50,000. But Armen Minasyan, a ninth grade
teacher who also there, put the figure at 1,000 to 2,000. The
official Soviet news media carried no report of the protest.
   The two residents, both speaking by telephone, said the crowd
dispersed after about 90 minutes when a speaker announced that
another meeting would be held Thursday.
   Popoyan, also speaking by telephone, said Armenian television
had broadcast warnings Friday threatening that ``all available
means'' would be used to control protests. Police and troops were
posted at two popular demonstrations sites in downtown Yerevan to
block demonstrations, he said.
   Yerevan and the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, were placed under
martial law and public gatherings were banned in November because
of the ethnic violence. A curfew enforced by troops remains in
effect.

<TEXT>
   Bush administration proponents of a greater
U.S. leadership role on global warming urged the White House to
call now for an international convention on the subject, but Chief
of Staff John Sununu said the idea was premature, officials said
Saturday.
   William Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Administration, was among those who wanted U.S. representatives to
make an official diplomatic overture to that effect at a United
Nations-sponsored meeting that begins Monday in Geneva, the
administration officials said.
   The proponents _ including Fred Bernthal, the assistant
secretary of state for oceans and international environmental
affairs _ contended it would be a strong symbolic move for Bush to
urge a convention of nations to develop a framework agreement on
how to combat the global warming trend known as the greenhouse
effect.
   Bush promised during the presidential campaign last year that he
would be an environmental president and would call an international
environmental conference to focus on tackling global warming.
   However, Sununu and others took the position that the government
is not yet ready to take such a step because more analysis is
needed on economic and other effects of the dramatic actions needed
against global warming, officials said.
   EPA spokesman David Cohen on Saturday said Reilly understood
Sununu's cautious approach.
   ``Basically he (Sununu) has been extremely supportive and he has
said only that he has some questions that he wants answers,'' said
Cohen, adding that Reilly believes the questions ``deserve
answers.''
   Although the proponents felt it would show a positive approach
and would cost little for the United States to stake out a
leadership position on the idea, Cohen said Reilly believes
Sununu's position was ``extremely reasonable.''
   However, other officials were known to believe Bush was missing
the boat at a chance to show environmental leadership.
   Sununu's office did not return calls for comment on Saturday.
   The idea being pushed would have been a formal U.S. statement to
other nations, urging an international framework convention to
negotiate such matters as joint monitoring, research, and other
cooperative efforts on global warming, said William Nitze, deputy
assistant secretary of state for environment, health and natural
resources.
   Nitze will represent the United States at the Geneva meeting
this week where a working group of more than 20 nations is
developing a report on response strategies to counter global
warming. The working group, whose meeting will be chaired by
Bernthal, is part of the U.N-sponsored Intragovernmental Panel on
Climate Change.
   Other countries may take the official initiative to move toward
a framework convention on global warming, but Nitze said that
absent a decision from President Bush he will not be able to make
any commitment.
   ``Politically there would have been an advantage to the
president making a statement,'' Nitze said.
   However, he said, ``The reason things are moving slowly on this
issue is that many people are concerned about the cost of really
addressing this problem.
   ``For the United States to really do something to limit
greenhouse gas emission may require some rather expensive and
potentially disruptive policies,'' he added. ``There's a sense that
if we were really to try to reduce emissions by any percentage, we
would have to make some very major investments.''
   The greenhouse effect is caused by burning of fossil fuels and
other human activities that have loaded the atmosphere with gases
and increased world temperatures, scientific evidence has shown.
   Many scientists say global warming will cause significant rising
of the seas and radical weather and rainfall patterns with dramatic
effect on agriculture.
   To turn around the trend would likely mean significant changes
in everyday life, including finding alternatives to fossil fuels
for automobiles and industrial use, creating dramatic impacts on
the petroleum industry.
   Thus any U.S. position on global warming would have
government-wide implications, including in the departments of
Energy, Commerce, Treasury, Agriculture and Defense and the Office
of Management and Budget.
   ``Governor Sununu and others want to have a better grasp of what
realistic options we could get people to accept before we start
down the road that could lead to a commitment,' said Nitze.

Talk</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-German Fears, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government criticized White House
officials Saturday for revealing details of a telephone
conversation between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Bush, who
are locked in a NATO policy dispute.
   Kohl and Bush spoke by telephone Friday in the latest attempt to
resolve the feud over West Germany's call for early talks with the
Warsaw Pact on reducing short-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
   Officials in Bonn refused to discuss the contents of the
conversation, saying Bush and Kohl had agreed to keep their talk
confidential.
   However, the White House later said the two leaders had failed
to resolve their differences.
   Kohl's chief spokesman Hans Klein said Saturday the West German
government believed public disputes would reduce the chances of
solving the problem before the May 29-30 NATO summit in Brussels.
   ``The more the positions are brought into the open and the more
they are emphasized, the harder it will be to achieve an exchange
of opinions before the NATO summit,'' Klein said.
   The dispute between Bonn and Washington threatens to mar the
harmony of the NATO summit.
   Kohl's center-right government is losing support among West
Germans increasingly upset with their strategic role in NATO
defenses and wooed by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's warm
overtures to the West.
   Kohl wants talks on reducing the missiles to start soon and he
wants to postpone a decision on modernizing the weapons until after
next year's elections.
   The United States opposes any negotiations on the grounds that
NATO needs nuclear weapons to compensate for the overwhelming
superiority of Soviet-bloc tanks, artillery, soldiers and other
conventional forces. Washington also says the missiles soon will be
obsolete and must be modernized.
   ``The United States posture has not changed,'' White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said after Friday's 20-minute telephone
conversation between Kohl and Bush. ``It does not appear that a
basis for agreement is there, but we'll continue to discuss it and
see.''
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the main
proponent of early talks with the Warsaw Pact, on Saturday said,
``the discussion on short-range missiles has grown out of any
proportion.''
   Genscher, in an interview on Hesse state radio, again urged
talks with the Warsaw Pact and said West Germany should have ``an
important word in formulating Western strategy as well as in

<HEAD>Defense Attorney Says Salcido's Return to U.S. Was Illegal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney for a former winery
worker charged with seven slayings said Sonoma County authorities
illegally brought Ramon Salcido back from Mexico to stand trial.
   Public Defender Marteen Miller said Friday that he would file
legal papers challenging ``the manner in which (Salcido) was
transported back to this country and the violation of a treaty''
with Mexico.
   After a brief Santa Rosa Municipal Court hearing in which
Salcido pleaded innocent to the seven counts of murder, Miller said
he would make his appeal before a preliminary hearing scheduled to
start Sept. 11.
   Salcido, 28, is charged with murdering his wife, two daughters,
mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law and a co-worker at the Grand Cru
winery near his Boyes Hot Springs home on April 14.
   Salcido's three daughters were found in a Sonoma County dump
with their throats slashed. One daughter, 3-year-old Carmina,
survived and remains under medical care at Petaluma Valley Hospital.
   Salcido was apprehended in his native Mexico by Mexican police
who were aided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   International treaties prevent criminal suspects from being
extradited from Mexico without hearings. Even so, Mexican officials
deported Salcido without a hearing, and he was flown back to Santa
Rosa with sheriff's deputies on a private jet belonging to
``Peanuts'' cartoonist Charles Schulz.
   Miller declined to say what action he might take if the judge
agrees Salcido's return to the U.S. was illegal. Theoretically, he
could ask that Salcido be returned to Mexico or ask that charges be
dismissed.
   Miller contends that an impartial trial is impossible in Sonoma
County.
   Salcido is kept in an isolated cell at the county jail, under
24-hour supervision that acts as a suicide watch.
   A gag order has been issued forbidding court and law enforcement
authorities from discussing the case with reporters.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Adnan Khairallah, defense minister for
10 years and President Saddam Hussein's closest confidant, was
killed in an air crash during a sandstorm in northern Iraq, the
government said Saturday.
   The Iraqi leader, in a statement broadcast by the state radio
and television, said the pilot of the helicopter flying the
50-year-old general to Baghdad on Friday lost control during the
storm and the aircraft crashed.
   Khairallah's body was brought Saturday to the capital, where
thousands of mourners took part in a state funeral led by his
father, Khairallah Telfah, and the Iraqi leader. He later was
buried at the family cemetery in Tikrit, his birthplace and
Saddam's hometown.
   Khairallah, deputy commander in chief of the armed forces, was
considered the second most powerful man after the president in the
tight-knit clan that rules Iraq. He was both a cousin and
brother-in-law to Saddam.
   Saddam said Khairallah died instantly when the helicopter went
down en route to Baghdad from the northern mountain resort of
Sarsang near Mosul. Mosul is 280 miles northwest of Baghdad.
   He said everyone on board was killed, except one person
hospitalized, but did not say how many. The statement said two
escorting helicopters survived ``the crazy storm.'' The site of the
crash was not reported.
   The Iraqi leader gave no further details. The helicopter was
believed to be one of the U.S.-built Bell helicopters that the
president and his aides normally use when traveling in Iraq.
   Khairallah was appointed defense minister in 1979, days after
Saddam assumed the presidency, and held the post throughout the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war that halted with a cease-fire last August.
   The president described him as ``one of the distingushed war
heroes and a sparkling star in Iraq's sky.''
   Khairallah was born in Tikrit, 115 miles north of Baghdad, in
1939 and joined the army in 1959. The president was raised by
Khairallah's father, his mother's brother, and married Khairallah's
sister, Sajdeh.
   Diplomats in Baghdad this year told a visiting reporter that the
two had a brief falling out last fall over the president's
treatment of his eldest son, Odai.
   They said Saddam's wife protested when the president ordered a
public trial for Odai for killing a favorite presidential bodyguard
in October.
   The diplomats said she considered the killing a tragic accident,
not a crime, and asked her brother to intervene with the president.
   Khairallah was a member of the ruling Revolutionary Command
Council and the highest command of the ruling Baath Party.
   He took part in the bloodless coup that brought the party to
power in 1968, when he was a young captain in an armored brigade.
   The tanks under his command surrounded the presidential palace
to force then-president Abdul Rahaman Aref to step down.
   Khairallah was married to the daughter of ex-president Ahmed
Hassan Bakr, who resigned in 1979. He had three children.

   Months later, attorney James Coleman remains
frustrated by Ted Bundy's execution _ not so much because he failed
to block it, but because the ``whys'' behind his client's killing
rampage will probably never be known.
   ``I don't think it will ever be answered,'' Coleman said. ``I
don't think we came close.''
   Coleman was Bundy's lead counsel for nearly three years and was
among the witnesses at his Jan. 24 execution.
   While he defended Bundy, blocking three death warrants before
Bundy's execution on the fourth, Coleman purposely kept a low
profile. He answered news media questions only about specifics of
Bundy's appeals and declined to appear on television news talk
shows.
   In a lengthy telephone interview from his Washington office last
week, Coleman reflected upon his dealings with one of America's
most reviled murderers.
   In his final days, Bundy was fixated on trying to understand
what had caused his uncontrollable drive to brutalize young women,
Coleman said. Bundy, convicted of three Florida murders, confessed
to 23 more in four states during talks with investigators who came
to Florida State Prison in his last days.
   ``I think he wanted to confess at least since he was arrested in
Florida (in 1978) with varying degrees of intensity. I think that
more than that, he wanted to talk about not only what he had done,
but why,'' Coleman said.
   Some investigators have said they believe Bundy was responsible
for 50 to 100 murders, but Coleman doubts there are many Bundy left
unconfessed and estimates his total at 36 killings.
   Coleman played down Bundy's execution eve interview with James
Dobson, a radio minister and psychologist who is a national
anti-pornography leader. Bundy told Dobson his crimes were fueled
by an addiction to hard-core pornography.
   ``I think that was a little bit of Ted telling the minister what
he wanted to hear and Ted offering an explanation that would
exonerate him personally,'' Coleman said. ``I had heard that before
and I told Ted I never accepted it.''
   Coleman said Bundy was intrigued by his final-week talks with
psychiatrist Dorothy Lewis, who focused on Bundy's childhood to
study the killer, who wore the mask of a handsome, articulate law
student. Bundy never knew his biological father and was raised
initially in the home of a sometimes-violent grandfather.
   But as the execution neared, Coleman said, there was little time
to get on-the-record details of Bundy's crimes or to study him.
   Coleman had argued that Bundy was incompetent to stand trial,
but said that Bundy opposed defense efforts to have him found
incompetent. Bundy, he said, ``basically destroyed himself.''
   The attorney recalled thinking, as he said good-bye to Bundy in
his holding cell just before his execution: ``He was probably his
37th victim. He executed himself.''
   Coleman said that as sickening as Bundy's crimes were and as
devastated as he would be if his own daughter were so victimized,
he felt it important to the justice system to ensure that even a
Ted Bundy receives an adequate defense.
   ``If it gets to the point when people get railroaded, then we
will have lost something very important,'' Coleman said. ``We came
close to that in Ted Bundy's case.''

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed three
Palestinians on Saturday, and Arab hospital officials said at least
137 were wounded in one of the heaviest days of shooting in the
17-month-old uprising.
   Clashes reached such an intensity that Palestinian youths used
mosque loudspeakers to urge residents to rush to hospitals and
clinics to donate blood, Arab reports said.
   The riots were concentrated in the Gaza Strip and broke out as
Moslems celebrated the holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end
of the holy month of Ramadan.
   The army confirmed the three deaths and said 70 Palestinians
were wounded, all in Gaza. An army spokesman, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Saturday was ``by far the worst'' day in the
Gaza Strip since the start of the Palestinian uprising.
   He said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin visited Gaza to
investigate the incidents.
   The shooting was the heaviest since riots broke out after the
assassination of PLO military chief Khalil Wazir in Tunis on April
16, 1988. Fifteen Arabs were shot and killed and more than 90
wounded as Palestinians rioted, blaming Israel for the murder.
   The deaths Saturday raised to 465 the number of Palestinians
killed since the anti-Israeli uprising began in December 1987.
Twenty Israelis have died.
   The clashes began in the Nusseirat refugee camp as Palestinian
worshipers were leaving a mosque after holiday prayers.
   The day is traditionally celebrated with morning prayers
followed by visits to cemeteries to memorialize lost relatives.
   Arab reporters said worshipers left the mosque and began
chanting ``Allahu Akbar,'' Arabic for God is great, and throwing
stones at about 100 Israeli soldiers outside.
   The soldiers fired tear gas and later live ammunition at the
demonstrators and killed one.
   The demonstrators carried the dead man to the cemetery, which
was crowded with Arab families praying and decorating with flowers
the graves of relatives and Palestinians killed in the uprising.
   As news of the shooting spread, Palestinians in the cemetery
began to pelt soldiers with stones. The army called in
reinforcements and used helicopters to drop tear gas on the nearly
500 demonstrators, Arab reports said.
   The second Palestinian was killed during the cemetery unrest.
   Hospital officials identified the dead there as Muhammed Abdalla
Zakout, 40, and Muhammed Muenes, 20, and said both were killed by
gunshot wounds to the head. They said 40 Palestinians were wounded
in Nusseirat.
   The army clamped a curfew on Nusseirat, confining the camp's
29,000 residents to their homes.
   Rioting quickly spread to other parts of the Gaza Strip. In
nearby Khan Yunis, Arab hospital officials reported one Palestinian
shot and killed and 53 wounded, including three in critical
condition, who were transferred to Israeli hospitals.
   They identified the slain Palestinian as 22-year-old Eid Salameh
Abu Masoud and said he was fatally wounded in the chest.
   Also in Khan Yunis, a Palestinian suspected of collaborating
with Israeli authorities was found stabbed to death, Arab reporters
said.
   Arab reporters identified him as 27-year-old Hassan Handeek. The
army confirmed the death but said Handeek was a criminal and not a
collaborator.
   Clashes were also reported in the Bureij refugee camp where 11
Palestinians were wounded and in the town of Beit Hanoun where nine
Arabs were wounded.
   In scattered clashes throughut the area, another 22 Palestinians
were wounded by army gunfire, Arab hospital officials said.
   In the occupied West Bank, two Palestinians were wounded,
including an 8-year-old boy.
   The United Nations Relief and Works agency in the Gaza Strip
reported 96 Palestinians were treated in area hospitals for gunshot
wounds.
   An agency spokesman said 27 Arabs were treated for beating
injuries and that 23 were registered in hospitals as suffering from
inhaling tear gas. He said six Palestinians were transferred to
Israeli hospitals in critical condition.
   The army's deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, said
Israel can defeat Palestinian nationalists with ``determination,
tenacity ... and the capability of adapting quickly.''
   He said few soldiers preferred to serve in the occupied West
Bank or Gaza Strip but said resources devoted to quelling the riots
were not sapping the army's physical or moral strength.

<TEXT>
   Britain and France accused Iran on Saturday of
inciting murder by urging Palestinians to wage an international
campaign of terror against Westerners in retaliation for slayings
in Israel's occupied lands.
   Israel's Foreign Ministry called the Iranian appeal ``a
bloodthirsty idea.''
   Britain said it would discuss the threat with European and
American allies, and the government tightened security at airports
in London and Manchester. There were no other indications of what
steps Western governments might take to counter the Iranian threat.
   The United States condemned Iran for the remarks on Friday. The
United States, Britain and France were singled out as targets in an
inflammatory speech Friday by Iran's Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
   Rafsanjani urged Palestinians to kill five Americans, Britons or
Frenchmen for every Arab slain in the uprising in Israeli-occupied
territories. He urged Palestinians to hijack planes or blow up
factories in Western countries to pressure Israel to release
prisoners.
   Rafsanjani also denounced the peace initiative of Palestine
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, who has renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Rafsanjani once was regarded as a moderate. His remarks
underlined a new and growing anti-Western trend that is part of a
radical resurgence in Iran.
   The British Foreign Office said, ``The incitement to murder of
British citizens or those of any other country is totally
unacceptable.
   ``It is ... an affront to international standards of behavior
and further confirmation, if any were necessary, that Iran is not
ready to accept its international obligations,'' it said.
   Home Office Minister Timothy Renton said he was certain all
Moslems in Britain would reject Rafsanjani's call. ``I was
horrified ... and I'm sure every law-abiding Moslem, Christian and
Jew in this and any other Western country will be horrified too,''
he told Independent Television News.
   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement that
Rafsanjani's declarations ``are totally unacceptable because they
accompany an inadmissible call to murder.''
   ``They are of a nature to create the presumption of
responsibility of Iran in all violent action which could now
come,'' the ministry said.
   In Washington on Friday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
denounced Rafsanjani's comments as ``another step backwards for
Iran from the community of civilized nations.'' He said the United
States held the Iranian leadership responsible for any attacks on
American interests or citizens.
   PLO representative Faisal Aweidah in London said he did not
think Rafsanjani's appeal would mobilize many militants in Britain.
   In Paris, Ayatollah Mehdi Rouhani, spiritual leader of the
Shiite community in Europe, said: ``The irresponsible and
anti-Islamic words spoken by Mr. Rafsanjani regarding the free
world prove that the extremist tendency has scored decisive points
in Iran.''
   He said Iran ``has been thrown into the extreme leftist camp.''
   Shiite Moslems predominate in Iran.
   The British Department of Transport issued an urgent directive
to airport authorities advising extreme caution. Its contents were
not disclosed, but a department spokesman said on condition of
anonymity that the agency was taking the threats ``very seriously''
and had initiated ``appropriate measures.''
   Extra staffers were sent to several airports on Saturday,
including Gatwick near London, to make increased checks on
passengers.
   A Gatwick spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the precautions had led to some minor holdups.
   A spokeswoman at London's Heathrow Airport also reported slight
delays as a result of the security measures. She said the
Department of Transport had provided detailed instructions, which
were followed to the letter.
   At Manchester Airport, the Sunday Times said police armed with
handguns and submachine guns were seen for the first time in three
years.

   Thunderstorms spread up the Eastern Seaboard on Saturday,
generating more tornadoes in North Carolina and bringing the threat
of flooding to parts of New England. A cold front brought a rare
May snowstorm to the Midwest.
   An early-morning combination of wind and rain downed some trees
in northern New Jersey, including five that fell on one house in
Englewood. Before skies cleared, up to three inches of rain fell on
parts of New Jersey in 24 hours, and gusts up to 51 mph were
recorded at Newark.
   Thunderstorms in North Carolina, where tornadoes caused
widespread damage on Friday, spawned more tornadoes Saturday in
western Rockingham County and near the town of Murryhill.
   The thunderstorms also produced wind gusts of up to 72 mph near
Mountain View, N.C. Winds elsewhere in the state downed trees and
power lines.
   Friday's storms left more than 20 people dead and hundreds of
homes destroyed or damaged throughout the Southeast.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was posted for central North
Carolina and Virginia, and for Delaware, most of Maryland, extreme
eastern West Virginia and southern New Jersey.
   Thunderstorms also were reported in Florida, where an inch of
hail fell at Palatka.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included an inch at Rumford, Maine, and about three-quarters of an
inch at Montpelier, Vt.
   Flood watches were posted for Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and
eastern New York state, western Connecticut and the Berkshires of
western Massachusetts. Gale warnings were posted along much of the
New England coast.
   Scattered showers brought rare snow to parts of Illinois and
Indiana on Saturday morning, including half an inch at O'Hare
Airport in Chicago.
   It was mostly dry across the rest of the country, with sunny
skies over much of the central and southeastern United States.
   Unseasonably cold air gripped the upper Midwest and set low
temperature records for the date in many cities.
   These included 17 degrees at Bismark, N.D., 32 in Burlington,
Iowa, 30 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 33 in Chicago, 23 in Dickinson,
N.D., 26 in La Crosse, Wis., 25 in Minneapolis, 32 in Moline, Ill.,
23 in North Platte, Neb., 26 in Rochester, Minn.
   The overnight low for the nation was 16 degrees at Phillips, Wis.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 29
degrees at Houghton, Mich., to 98 degrees at Gila Bend, Phoenix and
Yuma, Ariz.
   The forecast for Sunday called for showers and a few
thunderstorms from the Great Lakes region and the Ohio Valley to
the middle and northern Atlantic Coast, with a few showers in the
northern Rockies. Sunny skies were expected across the rest of the
nation.
   Temperatures were expected to remain below 60 across most of the
Great Lakes region, the Ohio Valley and the upper Mississippi
Valley, with afternoon highs only in the 40s around the Great Lakes
and the upper Ohio Valley. Temperatures were expected to be above
80 in southern Florida and across of the western half of the
country, with highs in the 90s or above in the southwestern deserts.

<TEXT>
   A sheriff investigating the three-year-old
death of a baby whose parents reported was abducted said Saturday
that the strangely similar slaying of another daughter gives him
hope he'll make arrests.
   Jersey County Sheriff Frank Yocom, 50, said he still thinks
daily about the June 1986 death of Loralei Marie Sims, which left
him angry and upset. ``It's worn on me,'' Yocom said.
   ``I've maintained throughout my investigation that I would never
close the case as long as I was involved in law enforcement in
Jersey County, make arrests and put this thing to rest,'' he said.
``And that's still my goal.''
   The parents, Robert and Paula Sims, are the chief suspects in
the latest case, the death of their 6-week-old daughter Heather
Lee, and authorities expect to make an arrest soon, police Sgt.
Rick McCain said Friday in this city of 40,000 people along the
Mississippi River near St. Louis.
   McCain said Saturday that neither parent is considered the
stronger suspect.
   The Simses deny any wrongdoing, and hope police will investigate
``with an open mind so the killer will be caught,'' said their
attorney, Donald Groshong of Alton. The parents have refused to
talk to reporters.
   The state Department of Children and Family Services on Friday
took custody of their 15-month-old son, Randy, and the parents are
staying with relatives.
   Their home in a middle-income, tree-lined neighborhood remains
an object of curiosity.
   Broken glass, remnants from Thursday night when authorities
broke a window to get inside the house, is still scattered on the
front porch, and the grass stands about a foot high.
   A sign on the front door reads: ``In case of fire, save our
dogs. We have dogs.''
   Officials investigating Heather's death have examined Jersey
County records, and have been working closely with Yocom, the
sheriff said by telephone from his office in Jerseyville.
   When authorities interviewed Robert Sims, 37, on Thursday night,
Yocom sat in. Sims ``made some comments that could be very helpful
down the road,'' the sheriff said.
   In June 1986, the parents, who then lived in nearby Brighton in
Jersey County, reported that an armed intruder barged into their
home while Sims was at work and took Loralei, their 13-day-old
firstborn.
   Remains believed to be Loralei's were found a week later near
the couple's former home. The parents were suspects, but no one was
charged.
   On April 29, the Simses told police that a masked gunman knocked
out Mrs. Sims, 30, and abducted Heather.
   Four days later, a fisherman found the child's body, which was
wrapped in a black plastic bag, in a trash barrel at a West Alton,
Mo., recreation area along the Mississippi River.
   It appeared the body had been refrigerated, and an autopsy
determined that Heather had died of asphyxiation about the time she
was reported missing, McCain said.
   Yocom said that when heard the scenario, he felt there was no
question anything ``could be that bizarre.''
   Hair samples were taken from a freezer at the home of Mrs. Sims'
parents, Orville and Nylene Blew, who were out of town the night
Heather was reported kidnapped, Yocom said. Tests are being done to
determine if the hair matches Heather's.
   Investigators also seized from the Blew home an infant's sleeper
that Heather was believed to have been wearing at the time of the
abduction, McCain said.
   In Loralei's case, however, evidence was lacking, Yocom said.
   ``You couldn't even call it a murder because the body was in
such bad shape,'' he said.
   The sheriff said he still gets weekly inquiries about the case,
and still feels pressure to solve it.
   In Alton, too, some folks are growing restless.
   ``That's all everybody is talking about now,'' said Jeanette
O'Dell, 67, who lives near the Simses. ``Every time somebody hears
something new, I get a phone call.''

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II ended a nine-day African visit
Saturday by telling Africans to reject the modern way of life and
instead embrace their own traditions and Christianity.
   The pope arrived back in Rome aboard a special Alitalia Boeing
747 after celebrating Mass for 75,000 people in Lilongwe, Malawi's
administrative capital. A group of Impi warriors wearing leopard
skins and carrying spears danced as he boarded the plane.
   John Paul's 41st foreign pilgrimage and fifth trip to Africa
covered 13,500 miles, taking him to the African island of
Madagascar, the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion, Zambia and
Malawi.
   In a papal first, John Paul flew on the supersonic Concorde,
traveling at more than twice the speed of sound from Reunion to
Zambia.
   But in the homily of his final Mass, the pope told Africans not
to abandon their roots.
   ``I put before you today a challenge _ a challenge to reject a
way of living which does not correspond to the best of your local
traditions and your Christian faith,'' said the pontiff, his white
robes flapping in the strong wind that swept the Army Air Wing
military airport.
   ``Many people in Africa look beyond Africa for the so-called
freedom of the modern way of life,'' he said. ``Today I urge you to
look inside yourselves. Look to the riches of your own traditions,
look to Christ.''
   The pontiff reiterated his plea for sustained assistance to the
640,000 refugees who have poured into Malawi fleeing civil war in
Mozambique.
   ``Every effort by the public authorities, the churches and
international organizations to help these brothers and sisters must
be encouraged and supported,'' he said.
   ``To you who have had to cross the border, I say: `Do not lose
hope.' ... We must all pray to increase peace and harmony in this
continent. The future of Africa is at stake.''
   At the departure ceremony earlier in Blantyre, the pope
expressed thanks for the ``truly African'' welcome he received in
Malawi, referring to the colorful dancing, singing and other native
customs displayed throughout the three-day stay.
   In farewell remarks to the pope, President-for-Life Hastings
Kamuzu Banda defended Malawi's record as the only black-ruled
African nation maintaining formal diplomatic ties with South Africa.
   ``I have always believed in seeing the world not as it should be
but as it is. ... Both of us believe in solving problems not by
violence and confrontation but through contact and dialogue,''
Banda said.
   Banda ended his speech by waving his elephant-hair fly whisk and
leading his personal troupe of women singers and dancers in
chanting, ``Long Live His Holiness the Pope, Long Live the Church.''

<HEAD>Magazine: West German Firm Helps Build Romanian Missile Factory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania is using technology
provided by a West German firm to build an assembly plant for
missiles that can carry nuclear warheads, the magazine Der Spiegel
said Saturday.
   The Hamburg-based news weekly said most of the rocket technology
for the Romanian factory came from the Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm
company of Munich. It said MBB developed it in the mid-1980s for
Argentina.
   The report, which will appear in Der Spiegel's Monday edition,
was provided early to other news media. It said the Romanian plant
was being constructed partly underground and was intended to
manufacture what Der Spiegel said are ``Condor-2 rockets.''
   The report did not specify the location of the Romanian plant.
   On April 14, Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu publicly
stated that his country has the ability to make nuclear weapons,
but he said the communist nation had no intention of making use of
the technology.
   Western experts say there is no way to verify the claim
independently, but that it is doubtful because Romania apparently
has been unable to complete a largely imported nuclear power plant
under construction at Cernavoda on the Danube river.
   In a similar report on the rockets last week, Der Spiegel said
that MBB technology was being used to develop medium-range missiles
for Argentina, Egypt and Iraq with a range of 600 miles.
   Der Spiegel said MBB circumvented West German restrictions on
arms exports by selling the technology through a consortium of
small companies in Austria, Switzerland and West Germany.
   The articles follow similar reports by other West German news
media over the past month. Prosecutors have opened a probe of
several companies in West Germany, including some that are MBB
subsidiaries.
   MBB, a giant aerospace and armaments company, has said it does
not want to comment on the reports while the case is under
investigation.

   Sunday Silence, a horse twice rejected at
auction, took the lead on the final turn then held off heavily
favored Easy Goer to win the Kentucky Derby at a chilly Churchill
Downs on Saturday.
   Pat Valenzuela, winning his first Derby, got Sunday Silence to
the end of the 1\ miles in 2:05, 2{ lengths in front of Easy Goer.
Awe Inspiring was another head back and three-quarters of a length
in front of Dansil.
   It was the coldest Derby day in 72 years _ 43 degrees as the 15
3-year-olds burst out of the gate. It was 45 degrees in 1917, when
Omar Khayyam won.
   Sunday Silence twice was taken to auction, once as a yearling
and once as a 2-year-old, and twice bought back by his owners
because of lack of interest.
   The entry of Easy Goer and Awe Inspiring, who finished third,
had gone off as a 4-5 favorite. The previous odds-on choice for the
Derby was Spectacular Bid, who won in 1979.

   Atlantis' astronauts soared past the
halfway mark of their four-day space journey Saturday, continuing a
light schedule of experiments as the probe they deployed soared
beyond the moon toward Venus.
   The workload aboard Atlantis was limited because the Magellan
probe and its rocket booster, which together weighed 45,000 pounds,
did not allow for many experiments to be carried aboard.
   Flight director Ron Dittemore dismissed a suggestion that the
astronauts had been on a ``joy ride'' since releasing the Venus
craft. He said NASA rules require a minimum four-day shuttle flight
to give crew members time to recover from any motion sickness
before conducting the crucial maneuvers required to return to Earth.
   More than half the 143 astronauts on earlier shuttle missions
became ill adapting to weightless space. Usually the illness was
not serious and lasted a day or two. None of Atlantis' five crew
members appeared to have suffered.
   ``We did sleep well and we're ready to roll today,'' commander
David Walker said after Mission Control in Houston awakened the
astronauts Saturday with a medley of their school songs.
   The crew had to work around two malfunctions Saturday morning.
The dial that regulates flow from a water dispenser in the galley
wouldn't work, so the astronauts attached a hose that controls
another dispenser. One of the cameras on board jammed and was set
aside while trouble shooters on the ground pondered how to fix it.
   The crew then settled into a day of metals processing, medical
and Earth photography experiments. Conversation was light and
mostly technical as they methodically went about their work,
talking sparingly with controllers 184 miles below on Earth.
   At midday, the astronauts dropped the pressure in the cabin from
a normal 14.7 pounds per square inch to 10.2 psi in a test of new
helmet equipment that will be used on future space shuttle space
walks. The cabin has to be partially depressurized for an outside
excursion. Dittemore said the exercise went very well.
   Walker said he and pilot Ronald Grabe and mission specialists
Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard were pleased to hear that
Magellan was still operating perfectly as it continued its 15-month
voyage to Venus.
   Early Saturday, the probe passed the 240,000-mile distance from
Earth at which the moon orbits, and late in the day it was more
than 350,000 miles out, streaking along at 6,700 mph. Venus was
still more than 158 million miles away.
   Magellan is to fire into orbit around Venus in August 1990 and
is to map up to 90 percent of its surface with a high resolution
radar system. The images, expected to be 10 times clearer than any
previously obtained, could tell much about the history of that
mysterious cloud-shrouded planet.
   Atlantis is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.,
at 3:43 p.m. EDT Monday.

   A passenger bus maneuvering tight curves on a
mountain road rolled off a cliff, killing 21 passengers and
injuring 21, police said Saturday.
   The privately owned bus bounced down a 400-foot canyon Thursday
near Cachicadan, a town high in the Andes Mountains 275 miles north
of Lima, police said.
   Survivors said the driver stopped on the road before attempting
a turn, and the bus rolled backward off the cliff, police said.
   Police said a mechanical fault is the suspected cause of the
crash, but they did not elaborate. Word of the disaster was delayed
in reaching Lima because the site is isolated.
   The injured were hospitalized in nearby towns.
   Police said the bus was en route to Cachicadan from Trujillo, 95
miles west.

   Five gunmen ambushed and shot to
death a Spanish rancher who helped U.S. agents try to break a
marijuana-trafficking ring, a U.S. official said Saturday.
   Timothy L. Towel, U.S. ambassador to Paraguay, said the rancher
was killed at the order of drug lords.
   Domingo Martin Martin, a Spaniard who lived in the Paraguayan
state of Ambaya for 20 years, was slain in his car Thursday morning
shortly after entering the Brazilian border town of Ponta Pora,
Towel said in a telephone interview from Asuncion, Paraguay.
   Martin, 55, was heading to a soy bean silo he owned in the
nearby Brazilian town of Zansapyta. He had slowed his car in a busy
traffic circle when the five gunmen, armed with automatic weapons,
pulled up alongside him in a car and sprayed his vehicle with
bullets, the ambassador said.
   He said Martin was killed instantly with seven shots to the head
and one shotgun blast to the chest.
   The gunmen escaped into Paraguay, Towel said.
   ``Martin was assassinated by drug lords who resented that he was
heroically helping to stop drug trafficking between Paraguay and
Brazil,'' Towel said.
   The Spaniard had allowed U.S. and Paraguayan narcotics teams to
use his properties near the Paraguayan town of Pedro Juan
Caballero, about six miles south of Ponta Pora, as a base camp and
air strip, the ambassador said.
   Towel said the agents had found marijuana plantations in forests
on the Paraguayan side of the border.
   Jeff Brown, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Paraguay, said
the anti-drug operation was to last two weeks. He said the drugs
were being smuggled into Brazil for local consumption.
   Federal police officials in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil,
said no one there was authorized to speak about the killing.

   Activists opposed to the sale of game
animals marched Saturday outside a supermarket where rattlesnake,
deer, and bear meat were being offered in a test-marketing study.
   But the Illinois wholesaler who supplied the meats to the store
said they were healthful, none were from endangered species and he
didn't know ``what all the squawk is about.''
   About 20 sign-carrying protesters stood outside the Cub Foods
store on the city's west side, handed leaflets to passers-by, and
chanted, ``Don't shop Cub, give Big Bear a hug.''
   The chants referred to Big Bear, a rival grocery chain whose
slogan is ``Give' em a Big Bear hug.''
   ``What we want are the meats taken off the market,'' said Robin
Russell, director of Protect Our Earth's Treasures.
   ``What they're (Cub officials) trying to do is expand
exploitation of animals,'' he added. ``We want them to say the
market study is done and that's it.''
   Allan Roosz, meat department manager at the store, declined
comment. Telephone calls Saturday to Cub headquarters in
Stillwater, Minn., were not answered.
   Terry Wilhite, Ohio meat merchandiser for the grocery chain,
said the products came from Czimer Foods, a distributor in
Lockport, Ill. He said the market was the only Cub store in Ohio
offering such fare.
   The meats offered at Cub Foods ranged from deer at $7.99 a
pound, to whole rattlesnake for $14.99 each. Black bear shoulders
were priced at $9.99 a pound.
   Columbus Zoo Director Jack Hannah had called the store to
complain about its sale of giraffe meat, The Columbus Dispatch
reported Saturday. Cub Foods quit selling African game after
receiving complaints about such sales.
   Rudy Czimer, vice president and manager of wholesaling for
Czimer Foods, said in a telephone interview Saturday that protests
were nothing new to the family business his father began in 1914.
   ``This has been going on for years ... I get letters all the
time,'' Czimer said. ``I don't know what all the squawk is about.
   ``The animals are raised on game farms, and there's not anything
on the endangered or protected (species) lists. The government
watches us on that,'' he said, adding that Czimer Foods does not
raise the animals, but purchases them from ranches all over the
nation.

<TEXT>
   European nobility in diamonds bought Chinese
watercolors, and a Chinese man in sandals took home a Roy
Lichtenstein print Saturday at a charity auction to raise funds for
the Great Wall and Venice.
   The second annual ``Safeguard Venice and the Great Wall'' art
auction drew bids topping $540,000 for more than 80 paintings and
pieces of art.
   ``It was a good surprise,'' said Joel-Marie Millon, auctioneer
for the Paris-based auction house Drouot. He said proceeds from the
auction were at least 30 percent higher than expected.
   The auction of modern art was the highlight of the ``Return of
Marco Polo,'' a four-day luxury tour of Beijing that includes a
caviar lunch on the Great Wall, banquets in the Forbidden City and
waltzes by the Beijing Central Opera.
   Each guest paid $6,800, not including air fare, for the visit.
   Daniel Vial, a Parisian public relations agent who has organized
the tour the past two years, said about 100 people, mostly European
jetsetters, rich businessmen and auctioneers, joined this year's
trip.
   He said they had expected about 300, but many canceled because
of recent pro-democracy student demonstrations that have convulsed
the Chinese capital.
   Organizers said they did not yet know how much money would be
left after expenses, but Vial said it would not be as much as last
year. In 1988, about $350,000 was donated to the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to restore 2,624
feet of the crumbling Great Wall and provide funds for the Basilica
of Saint Mark in Venice.
   The highest price at Saturday's auction was for an acrylic on
galvanized steel by American artist Robert Rauschenberg, which went
for $73,000 to New York decorator Tony Ingrao. Ingrao cast his bid
by phone from New York, and other direct lines were open to bidders
from Tokyo, Paris and Switzerland.
   An ink painting by famed Chinese artist Li Keran went for
$39,000, and an ink abstract by the daughter of China's senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, Deng Lin, sold for $12,000.
   The few Chinese in the audience at the Museum of the Chinese
Revolution watched in silence _ the average per capita income of a
Chinese worker is little more than $270 a year. But one Chinese man
dressed in sandals and a polo shirt, Song Wei, won a hotly
contested bid to buy a Roy Lichtenstein color woodcut for $6,200.
   ``He's a famous painter and no one in China has a work of his,''
Song said.
   Song, who said he is director of the ``Great Wall Museum of
Art,'' said he is Communist China's first collector of foreign art.
He declined to reveal his source of income, but said he made his
money in a ``normal'' way.

   A congressional panel investigating the
nation's worst oil spill prepared Saturday for two days of
hearings, but the committee's chairman has already drawn a few
harsh conclusions.
   ``Oil companies have demonstrated they have no ability, no
expertise, no capability in cleaning up oil spills,'' Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., said at a public meeting in the fishing town of
Cordova 50 miles from the spill site.
   Miller, chairman of the House Interior Committee's subcommittee
on water and energy, said Friday the spill ``is not just about
polluted waters, dead birds, otters. It's about disrupted
communities, families, lifestyles.''
   Miller's five-member panel has scheduled hearings for Sunday and
Monday in Valdez, near the section of Prince William Sound where
the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef March 24 and poured more than 10
million gallons of crude into the water. Members of the panel and
its 26-member staff continued arriving Saturday.
   The 987-foot tanker's former captain, Joseph Hazelwood, has been
accused of operating the ship while intoxicated, and faces a June
20 trial on misdemeanor charges. A grand jury is conducting a
felony investigation.
   Third Mate Gregory Cousins, who was at the helm when the wreck
occurred, said Hazelwood did not appear to be drunk at the time.
   ``There was no indication there was anything wrong,'' Cousins
said in a story in Saturday's editions of the Tampa (Fla.) Tribune.
He described Hazelwood as ``extremely competent.''
   Cousins has been on leave at home in Tampa preparing his
testimony for a National Transportation Safety Board hearing May 16
in Anchorage.
   Miller's panel will hear testimony from Coast Guard officers,
Exxon executives and environmentalists.
   Miller was quick to criticize not only oil companies but
Alyeska, the jointly owned pipeline service company in Valdez,
which is the terminus of the trans-Alaska pipeline from the North
Slope.
   ``Back in 1973, we made a compact with Alyeska and its owners,
including Exxon,'' Miller said. ```In exchange for the right to
drill for oil on public lands, (they promised) they'd do so in a
safe fashion.''
   But, he added, the oil company lobbied state and federal
officials to get the agreement changed to the industry's benefit.
``What we didn't know is that they'd spend the next 10 years
undermining that compact,'' he said.
   Exxon spokesman Karsten Rodvik said Saturday that he was not
aware of Miller's statements, and could not comment on them.
   In the more than six weeks since the spill, oil has fouled
beaches as far as 525 miles southwest of Valdez.
   The hardest hit areas include the islands within Prince William
Sound and beaches at Katmai National Park, a spectacular wildife
refuge on the Alaska Peninsula.

   A plane carrying American tourists lost
power in an engine and crash-landed in a remote jungle of the
Yucatan Peninsula, killing six people and injuring 10, officials
said Saturday.
   The Aerocozumel flight carrying 18 people was returning to the
resort island of Cozumel after taking the tourists to view ancient
Indian ruins at Chichen Itza, 115 miles west of Cozumel.
   It crashed at 2:30 p.m. Friday about two miles outside the Playa
del Carmen airport, about 125 miles northeast of Chichen Itza, the
airline said.
   Fifteen of the 16 tourists aboard were U.S. citizens and one was
a Canadian, according to airline representative Jaime Valenzuela.
   He identified one of the dead as Susan Montgomery, 42, of Canby,
Ore. He identified the others, whose hometowns and ages were not
available, as Guillermo and Margaret Salisbury, Pryor and Jayne
Hendricks, and Laura Chamberlain. All the dead were U.S. citizens.
   Valenzuela identified other surviving passengers as Gary
Anderson, Diana Len, Ross Blocksledye, Rosalyn Knobbs, Gilbert and
Sharon Barker, Catherine Wynne, Tony Knobbs, and Greg Chamberlain.
The other survivor was Glenn Robertson of Canada. Their hometowns
also were not available.
   Valenzuela said 10 injured people, including the pilot and tour
guide, were treated at Cancun's Social Security Institute Hospital.
He said none of the injuries were life-threatening. It was not
known who the two uninjured passengers were.
   Early reports had said up to 12 people were injured.
   The airline representative said the dead were being taken to the
Cancun morgue. U.S. consular representatives said they were working
on transporting the bodies back to the United States.
   Valenzuela said the 6-year-old, British-made Titalus Trislander
airplane was carrying the tourists under contract with Fiesta
Cozumel Holidays. He said it left Cozumel on Friday morning.
   Pilot Carlos Corso had 4,000 hours of flying time, the airline
representative said. He applauded the pilot's skill in bringing the
plane down without more deaths.
   The pilot radioed the Cancun airport tower when one of the
plane's three engines died. He crash-landed in thick jungle with
``very high, very thick'' growth up to 50 feet high, and search
planes found the plane about two hours later, Valenzuela said.
   However, helicopters were unable to land in the jungle, so
rescuers had to go in on foot.
   Red Cross worker Josefina Cardiel said the plane crashed inside
a ravine, and troops had to clear a path and provide rappelling
equipment so Red Cross workers could reach the plane.
   A rescue team of 70-90 people _ consisting of army, navy, Red
Cross personnel, and local residents _ hacked with machetes all
night, approaching the site about 6:30 a.m. Saturday, Valenzuela
said. They then cleared a spot for a helicopter to land.
   A navy helicopter ferried victims Saturday to a landing pad at
the Cancun hospital.
   Russ Knobbs, father of victim Susan Montgomery, said he and his
wife waited at the hospital hours before any helicopters landed.
   Knobbs, who had another daughter and a son on the flight, said
he and his wife suspected something was wrong when the plane didn't
come back as scheduled Friday afternoon.
   ``We had a pretty good inkling when they didn't return,'' he
said.
   Investigators were at the crash site to determine the cause,
said Capt. Rene Martinez, an Aerocozumel pilot.
   Chichen Izta is a large pre-Colombian archaeological site
popular with foreign tourists. Some of the city's buildings date
from 879 A.D.

   Two polls released Saturday indicate that
Americans are divided over whether President Bush should pardon
Oliver North, but most believe that the former Marine should not go
to jail.
   In addition, 63 percent of those polled by Newsweek magazine
believe that Bush was more involved in the Iran-Contra scandal than
he has said. And a larger number, 82 percent, now believe that
former President Reagan was more involved than he has admitted.
   Fifty-five percent want Bush to tell more of his role in the
affair, the survey found.
   The poll, to be published in Newsweek's May 15 issue, found that
while 51 percent believe Bush should pardon North, only 34 percent
believe he will. Sixty-six percent believe North should not be
imprisoned.
   A second poll by Time magazine and CNN found that 45 percent of
those surveyed believe that Bush should pardon North, while 39
percent said he should not. A majority of 53 percent, however, felt
North should not go to jail; 32 percent thought he should.
   Sixty-seven percent in the Time-CNN poll said they believed that
Bush had not told the whole truth about his involvement in the
Iran-Contra scandal; 17 percent thought he had.
   North was a key figure in the Iran-Contra affair, in which
federal officials sought to sell arms to Iran to raise money for
U.S.-backed Contra forces in Central America at a time when
Congress had stopped military assistance to the rebels.
   On Thursday, North was convicted of shredding documents, failing
to pay for a $13,000 security system at his home and aiding and
abetting the obstruction of Congress in connection with the
scandal. But he was found innocent of nine other charges.
   The former National Security Council aide faces a maximum of 10
years plus a fine of up to $750,000. His sentencing is scheduled
for June 23.
   The Newsweek and Time-CNN polls both found Americans to be
divided on the jury's verdict, but the results varied widely.
   In the Newsweek poll, 31 percent agreed with the verdict, 39
percent thought it too harsh, and 19 percent thought it too
lenient. In the Time-CNN poll, 47 percent agreed with the verdict,
33 percent did not and 20 percent were not sure.
   The Time-CNN telephone poll of 504 adults was taken by
Yankelovich Clancy Shulman on Thursday, the day North was convicted
of three counts. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.5 percent.
   Newsweek's telephone poll was conducted by the Gallup
Organization on Friday. It is a national sample of 500 adults and
has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent.

<TEXT>
   Merchants boarded up their stores and
shoppers jammed supermarkets to stock up on non-perishable foods on
Saturday as Panamanians warily took precautions on the eve of a
presidential election.
   The vote Sunday has evolved into another showdown between Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, the head of the Panamanian Defense Forces
and the country's de facto ruler, and the United States.
   Noriega, while stumping for his hand-picked candidate, claimed
that a vote for the opposition is a vote for U.S. control of this
Central American country.
   The opposition and U.S. officials charge that Noriega plans to
rig the vote to ensure the continuation of his iron-handed military
rule.
   Mindful of violent anti-Noriega disturbances a year ago that
shut down most businesses, some shop owners in the capital boarded
up their windows. People flocked to markets to stock up on items
such as rice and canned goods.
   A 13-member observer delegation appointed by President Bush
arrived in Panama City on an American government jet Saturday
afternoon despite Panamanian statements that the delegation would
not be welcome.
   Delegation members would not say if they had visas to enter the
country. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., heading the delegation, only
said, ``We have the appropriate documentation'' and declined to
answer further questions.
   The United States recognizes Eric Delvalle, who Noriega fired
last year, as Panama's legitimate president, and the current
government does not recognize visas issued by Panamanian consuls in
the United States, all of whom are still loyal to Delvalle.
   Panama has invited election observers from the European
Parliament and several Latin American and Caribbean countries and
has said uninvited delegations are unwelcome. But it has welcomed
an unofficial observer group that includes former presidents Jimmy
Carter and Gerald Ford.
   On Saturday, Carter toured the Panama Canal and discussed the
operation of the waterway.
   Murtha's delegation arrived at the U.S. Howard Air Force Base to
avoid the visa requirements and left in three military helicopters
for an undisclosed location, where they will stay.
   U.S. Embassy Spokesman Terence Kneebone said the delegation
hopes to split up into three groups to observe Sunday's voting and
plans to return to the United States on Monday.
   U.S. officials and a member of the delegation, all of whom spoke
on condition of anonymity, indicated the delegation was in Panama
on temporary orders from the U.S. Department of Defense, which
authorizes their presence without a visa at American military bases.
   It was not immediately known what, if any, access, the orders
might give them to the rest of Panama.
   But Maj. Edgardo Lopez, spokesman for the Panama Defense Forces,
said: ``I cannot go into the United States without a visa. They can
come into Panama without visas. This is a provocation.''
   A U.S. Southern Command official said Noriega's Defense Forces
set up checkpoints late Friday to control access into the former
Panama Canal Zone, where many U.S. military personnel live.
   U.S. personnel have had no problems leaving the former zone
area, despite the Panamanian checkpoints, the Southern Command
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The command, citing possible disturbances, planned to increase
security on Saturday. It previously had urged the estimated 12,000
American troops stationed in Panama to go into the capital only on
essential business.
   The canal zone once was controlled by the United States but was
among the areas that reverted to Panamanian control under the
Panama Canal treaties of 1977.
   Under the treaties, full control of the canal is to be turned
over to Panama in 1999. But the tense relations between Noriega and
Washington have complicated that treaty.
   The Bush administration, saying election fraud likely will
maintain Noriega's grip on power, said Friday it is considering
more measures to oust the military leader, including possibly
seizing his assets abroad.
   Although Panamanians will pick from two leading candidates, the
big issues have been Noriega's rule and Washington's influence on
Panamanian affairs.
   Pro-government candidate Carlos Duque said Friday the general
should remain as head of the Panamanian Defense Forces ``until the
year 2000'' to assure that Panama gets control of the Panama Canal.
   The eight parties in the pro-government National Liberation
Coalition contend that the opposition and the United States plan to
delay or cancel handing over the canal.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara has said he
will fire Noriega if the general won't retire, although Noriega has
installed and deposed presidents at will since he took control of
the armed forces in 1983.
   Endara is running for the five-year term under the banner of the
Democratic Opposition Alliance, a three-party coalition.
   The winner takes office Sept. 1.
   About 1.2 million of Panama's 2.2 residents are registered to
vote. Polls are open from 7 a.m. (8 a.m. EDT) to 5 p.m. The
government has promised results within 24 hours after polls close.
   In the last election, in 1984, Nicolas Ardito Barletta was
narrowly elected over Arnulfo Arias Madrid amid cries of fraud.
Noriega had Barletta resign and installed Eric Delvalle as
president in 1985.
   When Delvalle tried to fire Noriega in February 1988 after the
general was indicted in the United States on drug trafficking
charges, Noriega engineered Delvalle's ouster and installed Manuel
Solis Palma as acting president.
   Duque supporters have charged that the United States is spending
millions of dollars for the opposition campaign.

   Oliver North attacked Congress before a cheering
crowd of supporters Saturday, saying too many members interfere
unconstitutionally in foreign affairs. But he avoided any mention
of his Iran-Contra conviction.
   The event was sponsored by conservatives among Miami's
Nicaraguan and Cuban immigrants, who are helping pay North's legal
bill stemming from a 2{-year battle against charges that he misled
Congress and illegally accepted money from arms merchants.
   It was the former Marine lieutenant colonel's first scheduled
public appearance since a federal jury in Washington convicted him
Thursday on three of the 12 counts he faced during the three-month
trial.
   North used most of his 20-minute speech to criticize Congress,
suggesting it was giving Central America away to the communists and
accusing House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and other members of
acting like secretaries of state.
   ``They have too many people in it who decided to become
secretaries of state ... and too many who would usurp the powers of
the presidency that were granted to the president in (the)
Constitution,'' North said.
   ``We have a situation today where the Speaker of the House feels
like he has a role in negotiating with the adversaries of this
country,'' he said.
   North contrasted Congress' support of the freedom fighters
fighting a Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan with its refusal
to do the same in Nicaragua.
   ``As a consequence of that, thousands of young brave men and
women of the Nicaraguan resistance were abandoned in the field of
battle,'' he said.
   ``When the revolution without frontiers that has been promised
in Central America by the Sandinistas succeeds, it won't be on my
watch. ... It will be on our children's.''
   North's only reference to his legal situation was indirect,
coming when he criticized the Congress and the special prosecutor's
office for spending $40 million on investigating the Iran-Contra
affair. He said the money would better have been spent supporting
the Contras.
   Sitting at the head table with North was indicted CIA agent
Joseph Fernandez. North called for the audience to give financial
support to Fernandez, who faces trial in Virginia on charges of
illegally aiding the Contras.
   About 850 people cheered and applauded North, giving him a
standing ovation and chanting ``Ollie, Ollie'' when he was
introduced for his speech.
   North was convicted of supplying Congress with a false
chronology of the Iran-Contra events, shredding documents to cover
up the deceit and accepting a $13,800 home security system from
Richard Secord, who still faces trial for his part in shipping
weapons to Iran.
   The $100-per-person fund-raiser was sponsored by Concerned
Citizens for Democracy, led by Cuban-American importer Carlos
Perez, and the Miami Medical Team. The groups hope to raise
$500,000 for North.
   Former Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub _ whose fund-raising efforts
for \he Contras also surfaced during a congressional probe of the
affair _ is listed as a member of the first group's advisory board.
Singlaub has long been active in raising money for anti-communist
causes around the world.
   Miami, headquarters for the Contra fighters that the former
National Security Council aide worked so hard to support, remains a
hotbed of pro-North sentiment. But the area also helped lead to his
downfall.
   In early 1986, months before the crash of a C-130 cargo plane in
Nicaragua helped lead to the Iran-Contra plot's unraveling, the FBI
and the U.S. attorney's office here were investigating illegal arms
smuggling to the Contras.
   Then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Feldman, in prosecuting a
routine weapons case, stumbled on connections among drug dealers,
the Contras, now-jailed Cost Rican rancher John Hull and various
U.S. agencies, including the CIA and North's NSC.
   Feldman eventually drew up a chart with North's name at the top
of the illegal gun-running effort and tried to pursue a legal case
against those involved. That later led to charges that
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese tried to halt the investigation.
That case is still in the hands of the special prosecutors's office
in Washington.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of Britain's squabbling political center
has made a cautious overture to the Labor Party, the main
opposition to the governing Conservatives, reports said Saturday.
   The remarks by Dr. David Owen, head of the Social Democratic
Party, follow the socialist Labor Party's upset victory over the
Conservatives in a special parliamentary election.
   He said in an interview with a Labor magazine, ``Enterprise of
Labor,'' that he would have ``no problems'' serving under Labor
leader Neil Kinnock in a coalition as long as some policies were
changed, the domestic Press Association agency reported.
   The Independent newspaper also carried excerpts from the
interview, which quoted Owen as saying Kinnock had done a
``remarkable job'' leading the party.
   But Kinnock's office issued a short rebuff, saying: ``No pacts.
No deals.'' Owen split with the main body of Social Democratic
Party members last year when they merged with the Liberal Party to
become the Social and Liberal Democratic Party.
   The Social and Liberal Democrats have 19 legislators in the
650-member House of Commons, while the Social Democrats have three,
compared with the Conservative Party's 374 and Labor's 228.
   In Thursday's parliamentary election, Labor won a seat in the
Vale of Glamoran that the Conservatives held for 38 years.

   An Army warrant officer court-martialed for
espionage may have critically damaged several electronic
surveillance operations aimed at the Soviet bloc, The New York
Times reported in Sunday editions.
   James W. Hall III rendered useless one program that had cost
hundreds of millions of dollars and was meant to exploit weak links
in the Soviet communications network, the Times said.
   ``Without commenting on the specifics, it appears that Hall did
very serious damage,'' Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David
Boren, D-Okla., told the newspaper.
   ``We are looking at the potential _ and it's so far just
potential _ that this could be the Army's Walker case,'' one
official told the Times, referring to the espionage ring led by
former Navy officer John A. Walker Jr., who was arrested in 1985.
   Hall, 30, reportedly was recruited in 1982. He was arrested Dec.
20 and after pleading guilty to espionage in Feburary began a
40-year prison term.
   The Times said Hall, 30, was one of the highest-paid
Eastern-bloc spies, receiving $300,000 over a six-year span from
the Soviets and East Germany.
   The newspaper said prosecution documents at Hall's court-martial
said that Hall disclosed data on eavesdropping systems and
information about Western alliance plans in the event of a war in
Europe.
   The Times quoted unidentified sources as saying that Hall gave
East Germany or the Soviet Union NATO wartime scenarios well into
the 21st century.
   The newspaper said the United States first learned about Hall's
spying from a tip from a Central Intelligence Agency source inside
the East German government. The CIA source has defected to the West
and is in hiding.
   Few details on the nature of the information Hall relayed to his
agents had been released before.
   The Times said U.S. officials fear Hall may have been just one
of several American soldiers who were recruited by a 58-year-old
mechanic, Huseyin Yildirim, who taught auto repair to Army
personnel at Field Station Berlin, where Hall was posted.

<TEXT>
   The leader of this country's
Socialist Party has broken with the official Communist line in a
published speech calling for more democracy and independent
political parties.
   Socialist leader Jan Skoda, in a speech reported Friday by the
Svobodne Slovo daily, made a forceful plea for a stronger
parliament, independent parties, public referendums on major
issues, and academic freedom.
   Czechoslovakia's ruling Communists have curbed any independent
voice for the officially tolerated Socialists and other parties
since reforms were crushed in a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion in
1968.
   The Communists have recently rejected calls for reforms from
democratic opposition groups that they brand as anti-Communist.
   ``Without substantial progress in the democratization of
political, social and economic life, we shall not manage to ...
gain the citizen's support for changes, whose implementation is the
only way to overcome problems the society has today,'' Skoda was
quoted as saying.
   Skoda's speech stressed, however, that he wants to work within
the system for change.

   A small airplane slammed into a freeway
Saturday, killing all three men aboard and shutting the highway
down for hours. A second plane crash in California claimed two
college students' lives.
   The single-engine Cessna 172 crashed on the eastbound lanes of
the Pomona Freeway around 2:48 a.m. after hitting power
transmission tower cables in this city about 15 miles east of Los
Angeles, authorities said.
   No cars were hit, but all lanes of the freeway were closed for
several hours as the wreckage was carted off.
   In the other crash, a rented single-engine Cessna 152 went down
in fog Friday night near the abandoned Port San Luis lighthouse
almost 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles, officials said.
   The three El Monte victims had identification indicating they
worked for McDonnell Douglas Corp. in Long Beach, said fire Capt.
Robert Pasqua.
   They were Orville Stoll III, 33, of Buena Park; Vu Hoang, 26, of
Huntington Beach; and Mahmoud Abulkheir, 30 of Long Beach, said L.
Shelton, supervising investigator at the Los Angeles County
coroner's office.
   Abulkheir was still alive when firefighters pried him out of the
aircraft, but he died at the Greater El Monte Community Hospital,
said county fire Inspector Joe Silva. It was not known who was
piloting the plane.
   The plane hit static wires, which sit above power lines and
protect them by deflecting lightning, said Los Angelese Department
of Water and Power spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen.
   The aircraft was registered in Buena Park, but it was not known
where it was heading or where it had departed from, said Federal
Aviation Administration duty officer Jerry Acosta.
   There were differing reports on what may have caused the crash,
Acosta said.
   Pasqua said the plane apparently lost power, and said one of the
plane's two fuel tanks was empty.
   The crash near the lighthouse occurred near Avila Beach in fog
around 9:15 p.m. Friday, and may have involved engine failure,
according to San Luis Obispo County sheriff's Sgt. Joe Nungaray.
   Killed were pilot Thomas T. Laughlin, 24, and John K. Arbuckle,
21, both students at California Polytechnic State University in
nearby San Luis Obispo, said sheriff's Sgt. Steve Bolts.

   Authorities raided a cockfighting arena
complete with bleachers and concession stands Saturday and arrested
about 180 people from four states.
   John Bankhead, a spokesman for the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation, said authorities raided the 300-square-foot tin-roof
shed around noon. He said more than 200 people were attending
fights in three rings.
   Ten people, including the organizers of the event and the
property owner, were charged with commercial gambling and cruelty
to animals. About 170 others, mostly spectators, were charged only
with cruelty to animals.
   Authorities also confiscated about $30,000 in cash, guns,
marijuana and cocaine, Bankhead said.
   The fights, Bankhead said, were regularly scheduled events in
this northeast Georgia community. ``It's been going on awhile. We
just found out about it three months ago, and started sending
undercover people in,'' he said.

   Wind-driven rain and more tornadoes lashed North Carolina on
Saturday, as stunned residents throughout the Southeast picked up
the pieces from an earlier storm that left at least 21 people dead
and hundreds homeless.
   One child was seriously injured when a tornado touched down in
Rockingham County, N.C., but for the most part the new round of
storms didn't measure up to the intensity of those the day before.
   Seventy-five thousand customers of Duke Power Co. remained
without power, and company officials said it might be Monday before
service was restored.
   As survivors searched through ruined houses for further
casualties, they marveled at the destructive force of the
thunderstorms that lashed the region Thursday and Friday, snapping
trees, leveling homes and gorging rivers from Texas to Virginia.
   ``It's like you took a chain saw and cut down all the trees and
leveled all the houses,'' said Bill Seagle, a member of the Upper
Cleveland Rescue Squad in Cleveland County, N.C.
   In Virginia, four people died when they were swept out of their
vehicles in rain-swollen rivers.
   A 3-year-old girl and her six-month-old sister were killed in
Culpeper County after their mother was flushed out of the driver's
seat of their car as it crossed a bridge and the vehicle was swept
downstream, police said.
   In Buchanan County, a woman and her son were killed after their
pickup truck collided with another truck on Virginia 624 and the
pickup was forced into the Powell River. The two were swept to
their deaths, and a third person in their truck was missing.
   Elsewhere in Virginia, searchers found four canoeists who had
been reported missing on the Rappahannock River. In North Carolina,
search parties rescued six members of a Boy Scout canoeing party
whose boats capsized.
   Divers found the body of a 9-year-old at the bottom of a swollen
drainage canal in Louisiana. The boy had fallen in while reaching
for a stick.
   Altogether, seven people were confirmed dead in Texas, four in
North Carolina, three in Louisiana, two in South Carolina, four in
Virginia and one in Oklahoma. More than 100 people were treated for
injuries.
   ``The awesome power of these storms is unbelievable,'' said Al
Warlick of the North Carolina Department of Crime Control and
Public Safety after he viewed the devastation from a helicopter.
``It's simply amazing we don't have more fatalities and injuries.''
   Warlick said 41 homes were destroyed and 59 more sustained
severe damage in the worst-hit areas. He said about 200 people in
North Carolina were left homeless by the storm. In South Carolina,
75 homes were destroyed or damaged, officials said.
   The weather eased up Saturday, with only isolated showers and a
few thunderstorms in most parts of the Southeast. However, heavy
rain, hail and winds up to 75 wind raked North Carolina, downing
trees and power lines and making a difficult job even harder for
those cleaning up. At least two more tornadoes were spotted.
   Heavy rain also was reported in New England and the mid-Atlantic
states, while parts of the Midwest were chilled by record low
temperatures and snow.
   Survivors of the Southeast storm recalled how victims were
tossed against trees, crushed under houses and sucked into
floodwaters.
   J.E. Hoffman, whose sister and brother-in-law died when their
home collapsed near Toluca, N.C., cried Saturday as he searched for
family belongings strewn over a two-mile path.
   ``This is unbelievable,'' Hoffman said. ``It even peeled the
bark off the trees.''
   In Chesnee, S.C., George Powell found the body of his next-door
neighbor, Dora Lamb, who was thrown out of her mobile home into a
peach orchard when a tornado picked up the house like a toy.
   ``She was up against a peach tree with insulation all around
her,'' Powell said. ``It was the most terrible thing I've ever
seen. I've never experienced anything like this and hope I never
have to again.''
   Farther north, trees were reported uprooted in parts of northern
New Jersey, and storms in Pennsylvania closed roadways and flooded
creeks. A tornado was reported in Coatesville, Penn., but there
were no reports of damage or injuries.
   In Lancaster County, Pa., the storms closed more than 30 roads,
washed away one bridge, and trapped several motorists in knee-deep
water, rescue workers said.
   In Glen Echo, Md., near Washington, U.S. Park Police worked to
retrieve a dozen cars that fell into the Potomoc River and the
nearby Chesapeake and Ohio Canal on Friday when heavy rain caused a
parking lot to collapse.

   Police arrested 59 anti-nuclear
demonstrators during a peaceful protest Saturday at a base in
southeast Georgia for submarines carrying the new Trident II
missiles.
   Sponsors said 300 protesters appeared outside Kings Bay Naval
Submarine Base, making it the largest of 28 demonstrations at
nuclear facilities around the country.
   Pax Christi, a national Roman Catholic peace group based in
Erie, Pa., organized the protests to mark the anniversary of a 1983
pastoral letter from U.S. Catholic bishops that opposed the
development of first-strike nuclear systems.
   ``We're trying to draw attention to the fact that the Trident
submarine ... is a major move ahead in the arms race,'' said
Auxilliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of Detroit. ``It's part of an
overall first-strike capability.''
   The USS Tennessee, the first of 10 Ohio-class subs that will
operate from Kings Bay, arrived in January. Each submarine will
carry 24 Trident II missiles.
   Navy Secretary William Ball III has described the new nuclear
submarines as the most significant weapon development since the
Polaris submarines were launched in 1960.
   The protesters gathered to hear speeches and music beneath a
clump of moss-covered oaks and pines near the base's front gate
before marching to the base.
   Those arrested, including a 79-year-old woman who carried a sign
that read, ``Granny for Peace,'' were cited for trespassing and
obstructing the road in front of the base, police said.
   Bruce Nelson, a spokesman for the Camden County Sheriff's
Department, said Saturday night that two demonstrators, who gave
their names as John and Jane Doe, were jailed on charges of refusal
to give their proper name. The others were released after being
given warning citations, he said.

   Sport fishermen shouted racial slurs at
nine boats full of Chippewa Indians, protected under treaty rights,
as they slipped into the waters of a northern lake to begin
spearfishing on Saturday.
   About a dozen Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources boats
cleared a path for the traditional spearfishing boats through
dozens of craft skippered by anti-treaty protesters at Butternut
Lake.
   The crowd protesting the Indians' right to spearfish on
off-reservation lakes was estimated at 1,000 people.
   The protesters shouted ``go home'' and racial epithets, and
ridiculed a group of Indians and their supporters who gathered
around a drum playing tribal music.
   Most of the tribal members stood silently, although some tried
to talk to the protesters.
   Police officers wearing riot helmets and face masks patrolled
the lakeshore to keep the protesters away from the boat landings.
   The natural resources department moved 90 percent of its
173-warden staff to northern Wisconsin to deal with the increased
number of boats expected on the water, said George Meyer, the
department's administrator of nforcement.
   More than a hundred opponents of the Chippewa's treaty rights
were arrested Friday on the eve of the sports fishing season when a
crowd crossed police lines at a Trout Lake boat landing.
   Butternut and Trout lakes are among a cluster of lakes in the
north woods of Wisconsin.
   The arrests were the most in a day since the tribe began
spearing fish on northern lakes five years ago under a court-upheld
guarantee of 19th century treaties that ceded much of northern
Wisconsin to the United States.
   Meyer said the protesters, who have run boats past the Indians
to disturb their spearing, are a small percentage of sport
fishermen.
   Spearfishing begins during spring spawning, ahead of the general
fishing season, and is regulated by the Indians. It is far more
efficient than traditional rod and reel fishing. As a result, the
state had to limit rod-and-reel catches of walleyed pike on 254
lakes.
   Al Soik, president of Stop Treaty Abuse Wisconsin, said
opponents of the treaty rights were waiting to see what action Gov.
Tommy Thompson would take.
   ``If he stops the spearing, there won't be any reason for us to
go out there,'' he said. ``If he doesn't, we'll be back.''
   The Republican governor tried unsuccessfully Friday to get U.S.
District Judge Barbara Crabb in Madison to order the end of
spearfishing before the action began. Thompson testified that
violence could erupt and could lead to deaths if both the Chippewa
and the state fishermen are allowed to fish on the same lakes.
   Crabb denied Thompson's request, saying she would not allow
``violent and lawless protests'' to interfere with the tribe's
rights. Thompson said the state would appeal.
   Meanwhile, hundreds of people gathered at the Lac du Flambeau
tribal center to show their support for Chippewa treaty rights.
Organizers said the group planned to counter demonstrations against
Chippewa spearing.
   Tom Maulson, a Lac du Flambeau tribal judge, said he did not
think the start of the general fishing season would worsen the
situation.
   ``These guys come up here to fish, they don't want to fight
Indians,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump and singer Robert
Goulet did not authorize the use of their names in an advertisement
appearing Friday in support of ``shock TV'' show host Morton Downey
Jr., a Trump spokeswoman said.
   A full-page advertisement in USA Today reads ``Burn Mort? Why
not just burn the Constitution. We believe in Mort ... We believe
in freedom.''
   The ad also said: ``Television is the peoples medium and the 1st
Amendment protects the rights of the Morton Downey Jr. Show and any
show, regardless of its content.''
   Among the 25 names that appear at the bottom of the ad are
Trump, Goulet, Harvard law professor Allen Dershowitz and Broadway
producer Jerry Cohen.
   Downey's show, known for his confrontations with guests, has
suffered a ratings collapse in recent months, and several stations
have canceled the program because of decreased ratings, lack of
advertiser support or consumer complaints.
   Last month, Downey reported that he had been attacked at San
Francisco International Airport by neo-Nazi skinheads, who he said
cut off his hair and painted a reverse swastika on his face. But
authorities could not verify the story and some dismissed it as a
publicity stunt.
   Trump is upset about the ad because he did not give anyone
permission to use his name, said his secretary Norma Foerderer.
   ``He thinks it's horrible and unfortunate,'' that someone used
his name, she said in a telephone interview from the developer's
New York office. ``(But) he certainly supports the First
Amendment.''
   Ms. Foerderer said she received a call Friday from Goulet, who
also was upset at the unauthorized use of his name.
   Calls to Downey's New York office for comment were not returned.
   Rachel McAllister, a spokeswoman for Downey's public relations
Los Angeles-based firm, Schecter, Cone and McAllister, said, ``All
the people listed on the ad contributed to it.''

   The White House says President Bush and West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl have failed in their latest round of
long-distance diplomacy to resolve major differences over nuclear
weapons in Europe.
   Bush and Kohl spoke by telephone for 20 minutes Friday about the
West German's proposal to soon open East-West talks on eliminating
short-range nuclear weapons in Europe. The White House said Bush
was unchanged in his opposition to such negotiations.
   The dispute between Bonn and Washington on short-range nuclear
weapons _ missiles and artillery shells _ threatens to mar the
harmony of a NATO summit scheduled May 29-30 in Brussels.
   The United States opposes any negotiations on grounds that NATO
needs nuclear weapons to compensate for the overwhelming
superiority of Soviet-bloc tanks, artillery, soldiers and other
conventional forces.
   ``The United States posture has not changed,'' White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said after the telephone call. ``It does
not appear that a basis for agreement is there, but we'll continue
to discuss it and see.''

   About 1.1 million Panamanians are registered to vote in an

National Assembly and 510 municipal council members.
   Relations between Panama and the United States _ strained over

   The foreman of the Oliver North jury says the
jurors were caught in ``a war between the Democrats and the
Republicans'' and should have received the testimony of President
Bush and former President Reagan.
   Nevertheless, ``I think it was a fair trial,'' Denise Anderson,
34, told reporters at a news conference in her living room Friday,
24 hours after the jury convicted North of three Iran-Contra
charges and acquitted him of nine others.
   Asked whether the trial was fair even though Reagan was not
called to testify about the events that shook his second White

   ``I feel as though Reagan, and I could go on to elaborate on who

   The FBI agent who sued the bureau for
denying him promotions believes the door is open for him and other
Hispanics to advance, but Bernardo M. ``Mat'' Perez concedes the
door had to be kicked down.
   ``We, Hispanics, as any other American citizens, have a
contribution to make and we want to believe in the American
system,'' he said after a federal judge ordered changes in the
agency's promotional system and established a procedure for
promoting Hispanics wrongly denied advancement.
   ``All we want is an equal chance. Now we're going to get it.''
   Because Hispanics do the same jobs as other FBI agents, they
deserve to obtain management positions, the 25-year veteran said.
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton, after ruling in September
that the FBI discriminated against Hispanics, ordered a special
panel to be appointed to evaluate the claims of other Hispanic
agents in the class-action suit that they lost promotions.

   The ABA's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary would no
longer screen prospective nominees unless the bar group keeps a
commitment that it made to made to Thornburgh, says David Runkel, a
senior aide to the attorney general.
   The ABA denies it made such a commitment.
   As he left the Justice Department on Friday night, Thornburgh

<HEAD>Signs of Slowing Cheer Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The notoriously picky people who invest in the
stock market seldom act as happy about the state of the economy as
they seem to be right now.
   Wall Streeters wished for a slowdown in economic growth to take
the pressure off inflation and interest rates. Signs are piling up
that they are getting what they wanted.
   But some observers question how long investors will stay happy
over that set of circumstances.
   ``The rationale behind this way of thinking is that slower
economic growth means reduced inflation pressures, which in turn
mean lower interest rates,'' say analysts at Wright Investor's
Service in Bridgeport, Conn.
   ``Stock prices, so the saying goes, are slaves of interest
rates, so lower interest rates are good for the stock market.
   ``But stocks serve two masters. They are also the slaves of
earnings, and an economic slowdown would clearly have negative
implications for corporate earnings. Today's stock market investors
have yet to make this connection.''
   There is another problem, some analysts say, with the recent
economic statistics that have been so warmly received on the Street.
   Consider, for example, the surprise news on Friday that the
civilian unemployment rate took a 0.3 percentage point jump in
April, to 5.3 percent.
   While the data looked like a clear signal of slackening business
conditions, they provided little accompanying evidence that
inflation was abating as well.
   Average hourly earnings, in fact, increased at an 8.5 percent
annual rate in April, according to the Labor Department report.
   So hopes remained subdued that the Federal Reserve can reverse
course and relax its credit policy any time soon.
   They may get a further test this Friday, when the monthly
reading of the producer price index of finished goods is due to be
made public. Then, on May 18, comes the consumer price index for
April, which could represent another stumbling block for stocks.
   In part because of higher energy prices, the Merrill Lynch
Market Letter projects that the April CPI could be up 0.7 percent
to 0.9 percent, compared with a 0.5 percent increase in March.
   Faced with such thoughts, the stock market's six-month-old rally
flattened out in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials dropped 36.84 points to 2,381.96.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index lost .99 to 172.14,
while the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 2.16 to 430.71 and the American Stock Exchange market value
index gained 1.76 to 346.84.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 163.25 million shares a day,
against 160.64 million the week before.
   Robert Brusca, economist at Nikko Securities International, says
stocks appear to have benefited lately from what might be called
``the eye of the needle'' theory.
   ``This is the idea that the economy is slowing just enough for
the bond market to rally, the Fed to ease, and corporate earnings
to be little affected by the weakness,'' he said.
   ``Can the Fed truly steer this large, lumbering economy through
such a narrow passage? That seems unlikely. But looking at the
market's behavior, apparently others attach different probabilities
to this event than I do.
   ``If the slowdown is sharp and cumulates to a become a
recession, the stock market is in for real trouble.
   ``The obvious problem would be corporate earnings, but the
destabilizing effect of low interest rates on the dollar is a
factor too.
   ``I wonder why the market is so optimistic,'' Brusca concluded,
adding, ``I had this same question around mid-1987.''

<HEAD>Judge Burton Lifland: Arbiter of Eastern's Fate</HEAD>

   Eastern Airlines' tortuous path has taken it
through multimillion dollar losses into a crippling strike and the
refuge of bankruptcy court. Now its fate rests with a powerful
judge known for biting sarcasm, a penchant for popcorn and a
determination to get the airline flying again.
   In the nearly two months since Burton R. Lifland has been
overseeing Eastern's reorganization, his actions have chafed the
carrier and its lawyers. Even representatives of Eastern's unions,
who applaud many of Lifland's decisions, privately call him ``a
loose cannon.''
   Lifland, 60, has a style that some lawyers and acquaintances
privately say borders on the eccentric.
   During one tense, closed-door negotiation, he made bowls of
popcorn for everybody. His courtroom utterances are liberally
sprinkled with humor and jibes. He can reduce high-powered, haughty
attorneys to the level of red-faced, stammering schoolboys standing
nervously before him.
   Besides the rows of law books lining the walls, a huge poster of
Rumpole of the Bailey, the fictional British barrister, dominates
Lifland's chambers in the federal bankruptcy courthouse. The
high-ceilinged rooms in the turn-of-the-century Customs House
Building in lower Manhattan command a splendid view of the Hudson
River.
   Lifland rarely talks to reporters and declined to be interviewed.
   As the chief U.S. bankruptcy judge for the Southern District of
New York, Lifland has presided over some of the biggest and most
complex cases in history. They include former asbestos maker
Manville Corp., steelmaker LTV Corp. and farm machinery maker
Allis-Chalmers Corp.
   He's a graduate of Syracuse University and Fordham University
Law School, and frequently lectures at law schools and legal
conferences.
   Lifland's primary concern for the past two months has been
Eastern, since parent Texas Air Corp. put it into Chapter 11
protection from creditors on March 9, five days after a crippling
strike.
   In the Eastern case, as in others, Lifland has departed from the
historically neutral role many bankruptcy judges take, in the view
of some lawyers.
   ``He has been interventionist at the far end of the spectrum,''
said Karen Gross, a professor at New York Law School and a director
of the National Bankruptcy Institute.
   Early in the case, Lifland ordered the appointment of a
bankruptcy examiner for Eastern with extraordinary powers. He later
ordered all parties to explain why he shouldn't put the airline up
for auction.
   He has continually said it's in the public interest to get
Eastern back to a full schedule quickly.
   ``What I'm hearing is a reflection of parochial interests; what
I'm not hearing is the public interest here,'' Lifland scolded
attorneys for Eastern and the unions at one hearing.
   ``The public is a main player here,'' he said, citing the
consumers who ``have scrimped and saved'' to buy Eastern tickets
and can't use them.
   Statements like that have riled a number of bankruptcy attorneys
who are not involved in the Eastern case but say they are worried
about precedents that may be set by Lifland.
   Some believe the judge has lost his impartiality, has sided with
Eastern's unions and is pushing the airline into a hasty
``bargain-basement'' sale.
   They dismiss Lifland's public interest argument, asserting that
a bankruptcy court is charged only with protecting the interests of
creditors and shareholders. The public, they say, can find seats on
other airlines if needed.
   ``He's grandstanding and that's counterproductive,'' said a
bankruptcy attorney unconnected with the Eastern case who requested
anonymity.
   Even union representatives, who have liked many of Lifland's
moves, complain privately that he has raised their expectations too
high and has subsequently backed down on several occasions.
   ``He really has painted himself into a corner; there doesn't
seem to be any easy way out of it,'' said a union team member who
asked not to be identified. ``Bankruptcy judges do not do heroic
things very often.''
   In mid-April, sources say, Lifland was persuaded under pressure
to back down when he came close to appointing a powerful temporary
trustee to run Eastern, which in effect would have invalidated
management's authority.
   The trustee issue was at the heart of the collapse of
ex-baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth's $464 million deal to
buy Eastern from Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   Eastern's three unions, which had agreed to accept a reported
$210 million in labor concessions in exchange for a 30 percent
share in the airline, insisted on a trustee to replace Lorenzo
before Ueberroth took over.
   Lorenzo refused to accept the appointment of a trustee, which is
rarely done in bankruptcy cases and usually implies fraud or
mismanagement on the part of a company's bosses.
   Sources say Eastern's lead bankruptcy attorney, Harvey Miller,
mobilized other lawyers to warn Lifland against naming a trustee
and the signal that would send. Miller, widely considered one of
the most prominent bankruptcy lawyers in the country, declined
comment on the matter.
   ``I think he (Lifland) saw he was going to have a battle'' if he
opted for a trustee, said a source close to the situation.
   Lifland does have defenders in the legal community, however.
   ``I know him to be a dedicated, sincere judge. He's very well
motivated,'' said Joseph Gassen, a former bankruptcy judge who is
now an attorney in Miami.
   Lifland is trying to find a timely solution to revive Eastern,
he said.
   The judge's razor-sharp humor is relentless.
   In one hearing, after making a lengthy speech, Miller somberly
presented a towering stack of documents to Lifland. He waved them
away, telling the attorney, ``I had planned to devour a Robert
Ludlum novel tonight.''
   On another occasion, Lifland expressed disappointment that ``no
members of the female gender graced'' the lawyers' bench at that
particular hearing.
   At a hearing on Eastern in late April, pilots union attorney
Bruce Simon said he was so angered by Miller's remarks that ``I am
moved to stand.''
   ``Would you be less moved if you sat down?'' Lifland shot back.

   If brokers in New York's commodities pits
thought they'd dodged government scrutiny into sleazy trading acts,
they've been jolted back to reality by federal agents armed with
search warrants and subpoenas.
   A surprise hunt for evidence into possible wrongdoing at four of
New York's five commodities exchanges this past week signaled a new
frontier of investigation by law enforcement agencies that earlier
had targeted markets in Chicago and had said they would examine
trading frauds elsewhere.
   Accounts of the raid performed by teams from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and U.S. Postal Service indicated more
than 50 futures traders were subpoenaed by investigators looking
into possible civil and criminal violations, although the exact
nature of alleged wrongdoing was unclear by the weekend.
   Nonetheless, the action stunned the New York Mercantile
Exchange, Commodity Exchange, Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange and
New York Cotton Exchange, which had been spared the negative
publicity of a government investigation suffered for months by the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade.
   Federal officials said the Chicago and New York probes weren't
related. But there was speculation they targeted some of the same
types of questionable practices that historically have dogged the
furious pace of commodities trading in the cramped futures pits of
both cities.
   One focus was said to be front-running, in which unscrupulous
traders make profitable transactions for themselves before
attending to their customers' orders. Another was said to be
pre-arranged trading, when buyers and sellers profit via secret
arrangements that can victimize innocent third parties.
   Both the Chicago and New York probes come against a background
of explosive growth in the trading of commodities contracts, which
allow investors to bet on the direction of prices of goods ranging
from gasoline to frozen pork bellies to stock index futures.
   Part of the expansion stems from the 1980s era of lax regulation
over the nation's securities and commodities markets, some experts
say.
   Others attribute it to the enormous growth in futures markets
worldwide and technological leaps that allow investors in Singapore
to gamble on corn prices in Chicago, or speculators in Paris to
hedge risky positions in orange juice futures in New York.
   Some futures-industry experts predict the widely heralded advent
of 24-hour trading via the use of sophisticated computer technology
_ originally aimed at catering to worldwide investors _ will help
curb abusive or illegal practices like those under investigation
now.
   ``We'd like to think that electronic trading would better define
an audit trail,'' said Barbara B. Diamond, director of Diamond
Services Group, a trading and consulting firm, and co-author of a
new book on 24-hour trading. Nonetheless, she said, ``until we see
it in operation, we don't know.''
   Alan Bromberg, a professor at Southern Methodist University and
expert on securities and commodities frauds, said he believed
computerized markets probably would be more efficient but some
frauds likely would go undetected.
   ``As far as manipulation of markets, that's going to be harder
to trace, because you may run the market up in Sydney in order to
top the market in Chicago or New York,'' he said. ``It's going to
be very tricky.''
   In other important business and economic news this past week:
   _More evidence emerged of a nationwide economic slowdown, easing
pressure on interest rates. Government reports showed April
unemployment rose 0.3 percent. March home sales declined 5.5
percent from a month earlier and March factory orders rose 0.7
percent but the rise was caused by a jump in demand for new
aircraft, which fluctuates sharply from month to month.
   _In the turbulent world of the airlines, potential new bidders
arose for strike-crippled Eastern, its parent Texas Air Corp.
reported a record first-quarter loss of $255.5 million because of
the walkout, Pan Am reported a $151 million quarterly loss due to a
drop in trans-Atlantic business partly because of terrorism fears,
and Northwest reached a temporary truce with suitor Marvin Davis.
   _California's highest court upheld most of a controversial law
rolling back insurance rates, which could have profound
implications for policyholders and insurers nationwide if other
states adopt similar measures. Consumer groups welcomed the ruling
while the insurance industry denounced it, calling the law
arbitrary and unfair.

   Unisys Corp. faces a defense-contracting
scandal and a quarterly loss, but the nation's third-biggest
computer company isn't talking about trouble. Instead, its chairman
wants to double revenue to $20 billion in five years.
   ``The arithmetic is not so difficult to fathom,'' W. Michael
Blumenthal said of his plans. ``If we can achieve double-digit
growth in the next several years, it will go a good distance toward
achieving that goal.''
   Investors don't have much faith in the growth plan, but
Blumenthal, 63, has defied the odds before, starting when he fled
with his family from Nazi Germany and survive the Japanese bombing
of Shanghai.
   Blumenthal, who still speaks with a German accent, earned a
doctorate from Princeton University and became Secretary of the
Treasury in the Carter administration. In 1986, as chairman of
Burroughs Corp., he engineered the $4.8 billion purchase of Sperry
Corp. to create Unisys.
   The modest success of Unisys has quieted skeptics who said the
merger of two old, slow-growing makers of incompatible mainframe
computers would never work.
   Bigness is important to Blumenthal because he believes it gives
the company credibility against International Business Machines
Corp., the biggest computer maker. Digital Equipment Corp. is
second.
   Blumenthal says he is hoping to achieve his growth goal through
acquisitions as well as internal expansion, especially in the
rapidly growing field of ``open systems'' _ computers that can run
a wider variety of programs.
   A measure of investors' skepticism is that Unisys' stock price
is less than eight times last year's per-share earnings, compared
with a ratio for IBM of more than 11.
   ``The market is valuing this company as if this growth strategy
will fail,'' said Donald Young, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein
&amp; Co. That assessment, he said, might be slightly harsh.
   A prolonged suspension by the Navy, brought about by the
investigation of the Pentagon procurement scandal, ``Operation Ill
Wind,'' has slowed progress toward that goal.
   Two former executives and two former consultants who worked for
Unisys have pleaded guilty in the case, which involves bribes paid
to Pentagon officials to win contracts.
   In March, three divisions of Unisys were barred indefinitely
from bidding on Navy contracts. Unisys is negotiating a monetary
settlement with the Justice Department that could lead to the Navy
allowing it to resume bidding.
   Financial analysts are estimating the Navy suspension will be
lifted soon, possibly sometime this summer. But they also say there
could be further indictments before the case is done.
   ``I get the impression the worst is yet to come,'' Young said.
   Unisys has been lucky so far in that few new contracts have been
put up for bid, and the company is continuing to do business under
old ones, said Curt Hessler, Unisys' chief financial officer. He
said the financial effect has been minor.
   The executives and the three suspended businesses were part of
the old Sperry. Unisys executives claim those convicted were
``rotten apples'' employed by a company now under new management.
   ``It was a rarity within Sperry and a rarity within the industry
and they deserve what they get,'' Hessler said of the former
executives.
   Blumenthal is confident an internal investigation that resulted
in the departure of 17 executives and the cancellation of contracts
with 60 consultants has rid the company of corruption.
   ``It's behind us. In a sense, it isn't our problem,'' he said.
   For Blumenthal, the company's other glaring problem _ a $78.7
million loss in the first quarter _ is also in the past.
   Blumenthal said the loss was due mostly to the rough transition
to a new mainframe computer line. The 2200 series of mainframes was
not available when expected and customers stopped buying the model
it replaced _ the 1100.
   But demand has been strong since the 2200 became available late
in the first quarter, Blumenthal said. Analysts agree that Unisys
will return to profitability in the current quarter.
   To achieve $20 billion in revenue, Blumenthal is focusing on
open systems _ or computers that can use different kinds of
software, not just the programs sold by, for instance, Unisys.
   The strategy is to grow at single-digit rates in older
businesses, keeping up with the industry pace, while gaining market
share in the fast-growing market for open systems based on Unix
software.
   Blumenthal also sees a consolidation that will have Unisys
acquiring smaller companies that can help it grow in networking,
software, telecommunications and professional services.
