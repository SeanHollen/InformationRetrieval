<HEAD>Denver, Seattle Elections Focus on Growth; Money Issues on Ballot
Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in Denver today were deciding whether to replace the
nation's fifth busiest airport, while Seattle residents considered
clamping a ceiling on the tallest downtown in the West.
   In Pennsylvania and Oregon, residents are voting on statewide
changes in the way they are taxed, and two cities _ Pittsburgh and
Erie, Pa. _ are holding primary elections to replace mayors who
developed the same rare disease.
   And in Tucson, Ariz., school officials are hoping voters will
pass a $398 million school bond package that's 10 times more
expensive than one they rejected last year.
   The election in Denver culminates years of debate over whether
to replace Stapleton International Airport and build the first
major new U.S. airport since 1974.
   Supporters of the non-binding ballot issue, including Mayor
Federico Pena, say 60-year-old Stapleton is obsolete and
overburdened. Opponents, who hired political consultant Roger Ailes
to produce their advertising, say the new airport is unneeded and
would be a waste of money.
   Although the cost of a new airport has been estimated at $1.7
billion to $2.3 billion, recent polls have shown that Denver
residents support construction by about a 2-1 margin.
   Federal Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner predicted Monday
that the referendum would pass. He also advised other cities to
consider similar measures.
   Seattle residents were voting on a citizens' ballot initiative
that would set limits on downtown development for the next decade.
   The measure would limit the size of new buildings to 450 feet _
about 38 stories. The city now has more than 10 buildings taller
than 450 feet. The 76-story Columbia Center is the West Coast's
tallest building.
   Backers of the initiative decry the ``Manhattanization'' of
Seattle. Opponents say the measure would rein in economic
development.
   Pennsylvania has the most active election schedule. Voters were
considering a statewide ballot issue that would allow counties to
impose an income tax. The idea is to give local authorities leeway
to lower property taxes, but the measure has stirred strong
opposition.
   Another measure on the Pennsylvania ballot would legalize
charity raffles and other non-profit games of chance.
   In Pittsburgh, Mayor Sophie Masloff is trying to hold onto the
office she inherited last year from the late Mayor Richard S.
Caliguiri. Mrs. Masloff was appointed to the post after Caliguiri
died of amyloidosis, a rare heart disease. She has faced strong
opposition from Allegheny County controller Frank Lucchino.
   Six Democrats and two Republicans are vying to succeed Erie
Mayor Louis J. Tullio. Tullio announced that he was retiring after
he contracted the same disease that killed Caliguiri.
   In Oregon, voters were considering a change in the property tax
formula to assist about 100 public school districts with inadequate
tax bases. The change, which is backed by Gov. Neil Goldschmidt,
would reset all districts' tax bases to give them greater authority
to raise taxes without seeking voter approval.

   China and the Soviet Union have normalized
relations after a 30-year rift, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said
Tuesday after welcoming Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to a
summit at the Great Hall of the People.
   Xinhua, China's official news agency, said the 84-year-old
senior leader of the world's most populous nation declared the
schism healed at his meeting with Gorbachev at the start of the
Kremlin leader's second day in China.
   Gorbachev on Monday apologized for the Soviet role in three
decades of sour relations and opened the first Chinese-Soviet
summit since 1959 by declaring: ``This period has come to an end.''
   Skipping a scheduled wreath-laying at a monument surrounded by
tens of thousands of students calling for democracy, Gorbachev went
directly to the meeting with Deng, who has relinquished most of his
official posts since launching the reforms that spurred China's
remarkable economic growth in the past decade.
   ``All the world is concerned with our meeting,'' Deng told his
guest at the start of their talks in a red-carpeted meeting room in
the Great Hall, just off Tiananmen Square taken over by the student
demonstrators.
   ``The key political problems in the world come from relations
between the United States and the Soviet Union.''
   But he expressed satisfaction that Gorbachev had embarked on a
more conciliatory Soviet foreign policy. He said he has ``noticed
there may be a turning point in competition between the United
States and the Soviet Union.''
   ``The situation is changing from confrontation to dialogue,''
Deng observed.
   Deng welcomed the reformist Soviet leader as ``comrade'' and
gave him a lengthy handshake, but he made no move to award
Gorbachev the bear hug he sometimes gives close friends.
   The student leaders meanwhile held a news conference in the
square urging Gorbachev to take up their cause with Chinese
officials.
   ``As a great political reformer, we urge Mikhail Gorbachev to
talk to the government on our behalf for humanitarian reasons,''
Wang Dan, a student leader from Beijing University told reporters.
   The Soviets have sought to avoid any involvement with the
students, saying they regard the matter as a strictly internal
affair for the Chinese to handle alone.
   But Gorbachev's hosts repeatedly revised his schedule, moving
events to keep the Soviet leader away from the demonstrators
calling for democracy.
   ``We regard this with necessary understanding,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said of the schedule
changes. ``We have similar experience and have lived through some
difficult times.''
   Gorbachev's government has encouraged greater freedom of
expression at home and has seen mass demonstrations in recent
months, even ethnic violence.
   At a meeting with President Yang Shangkun, the ceremonial head
of state, on Monday, Gorbachev expressed ``sorrow and regret''
about the long period of animosity.
   In a portion of his remarks broadcast by Chinese television,
Gorbachev said: ``Very probably we are also responsible for that
period to a certain extent.''
   Gerasimov said the two sides agreed at the outset they would not
examine the causes of old wounds but would discuss the future and
how to help with each other's reform programs.
   He said Gorbachev was told that Deng wanted to ``finish with the
past and turn toward the future.''
   The Gorbachev visit is the first by a Soviet leader since Nikita
S. Khrushchev left angrily in 1959 after a frosty meeting with Mao
Tse-tung that led to the breakdown in relations.
   Mao rejected what he considered Soviet ``revisionism'' following
the death of Josef Stalin in 1953 and deeply resented what he
considered Soviet efforts to dominate the world Communist movement.
   China, with more than a billion people, and the Soviet Union
fought border skirmishes in 1969. They have been at odds over
Afghanistan, Cambodia and what the Chinese called Soviet
``hegemonism.''
   Both sides agreed Gorbachev's meeting with Deng would restore
normal government relations and ties between the two Communist
parties. They also expressed confidence about increased economic,
cultural and academic contacts.
   In a banquet toast Monday night, Gorbachev said: ``The way
toward this meeting was not an easy one. It required from both
sides wisdom, responsibility and perseverance in removing the
negative aggravations and prejudices that marred our relations for
so many years.''
   Yang agreed that ``Sino-Soviet relations traversed a tortuous
course in the past'' and said: ``Today we have come to a new
starting point.''
   Gorbachev also said ``improvement of Soviet-Chinese relations is
not directed against any third country. In the final analysis, the
entire world community stands to gain from that improvement.''
   The United States, which benefited strategically from the split
between the nations it once regarded as its main adversaries, now
says improved Soviet-Chinese relations contribute to world
stability.
   Occupation of Tienanmen Square by up to 150,000 student hunger
strikers, supporters and bystanders disrupted the summit schedule
from the start. The square is the symbolic center of Chinese power
and the customary site for official welcoming ceremonies.
   Authorities threatened to clear it with force if the
demonstrators refused to leave, but were clearly reluctant to risk
bloodshed on the visit by Gorbachev, whose tolerance of dissent has
won worldwide praise.
   Officials moved the welcoming ceremony to the airport and
Gorbachev's motorcade, which was to have passed the square, took a
detour when thousands of people surged past police lines onto the
broad boulevard in front of the Forbidden City.
   The Soviet president's meeting with Yang was delayed nearly two
hours by the change in plans. Gorbachev was slipped into the Great
Hall of the People through a side entrance rather than approaching
from the side giving onto the plaza, where the students were
encamped.

<HEAD>United Nations Hopeful Independence Process is Back on Track</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Namibia's transition to independence is
likely to get back on schedule now that South African troops have
returned to base and most SWAPO guerrillas have withdrawn to
Angola, a U.N. official says.
   Cedric Thornberry, a senior spokesman for the U.N. monitoring
force in Namibia, predicted Monday that South Africa would comply
with a timetable calling for removal of all but 1,500 of its
soldiers by June 30.
   The planned one-year transition to independence was disrupted on
April 1, the day it began, when an estimated 1,600 guerrillas of
the South-West Africa People's Organization crossed into northern
Namibia despite an arrangement for them to remain at their bases in
Angola.
   South African officials say 316 guerrillas and 27 members of the
security forces were killed in clashes that followed the incursion.
SWAPO leaders subsequently instructed their men to withdraw to
Angola.
   On Monday, officials from South Africa, Cuba and Angola met at
Ruacana, an Angolan town near the Namibian border, to assess the
extent of SWAPO's withdrawal. South Africa has said the entire
independence process could be in jeopardy if it determines that
substantial numbers of guerrillas have failed to move to bases at
least 100 miles inside Angola.
   U.S., Soviet and United Nations officials attended the talks as
observers.
   South African military units, which were supposed to be confined
to base under terms of the U.N. independence plan, emerged to
assist territorial police in pursuing the guerrillas. The troops
returned to base Saturday.
   South Africa agreed to end its 74-year rule over Namibia as part
of an agreement signed in December which also calls for a phased
withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola.

<TEXT>
   Mel Brooks will return to network television
next season after 14-year absence with a new comedy for NBC, ``Nutt
House,'' starring Cloris Leachman and Harvey Korman as the wacky
staff of a New York hotel.
   Brooks teams with co-executive producer Alan Spencer, whose
``Sledge Hammer!'' on ABC, a spoof of detective shows, was often
likened to Brooks' off-the-wall spy satire of 20 years earlier,
``Get Smart!''
   ``Nutt House'' is one of only five new shows on NBC's 1989-90
schedule. The network has been No. 1 in the ratings for four
seasons and had little reason to change its lineup. Monday, Tuesday
and Thursday nights were left intact.
   The only other new half-hour comedy is ``Sister Kate,'' starring
Stephanie Beacham (``Dynasty'') as a nun with a flock of orphans to
oversee.
   NBC's only sore spot has been Friday night, which it completely
revamped with three new hour-long dramas: ``Baywatch,'' starring
David Hasselhoff and Parker Stevenson as Southern California
lifeguards, based on a TV movie of the past season; ``Hardball,''
an old-cop-young-cop yarn starring John Ashton (``Beverly Hills
Cop'') and Richard Tyson; and ``Mancuso, FBI,'' with Robert Loggia
reprising his role from the miniseries ``Favorite Son.''
   ``Quantum Leap,'' a well-received science-fiction drama recently
added to the schedule, made the cut, as did this season's newcomers
``Dear John'' and ``Empty Nest,'' which premiered last fall in time
periods surrounded by hit shows. ``Midnight Caller'' was also
renewed, as previously announced.
   Off the schedule was the mid-season replacement
``Nightingales,'' Aaron Spelling's first series for NBC. It was
criticized for its cheesecakey portrayal of student nurses.
   Other mid-season replacements that weren't on the fall schedule
included ``Tattinger's'' revamp ``Nick and Hillary,'' and spring
tryouts ``Dream Street,'' ``The Jim Henson Hour,'' ``Nearly
Departed,'' ``One of the Boys,'' ``The Father Dowling Mysteries''
and ``Unsub.''
   ``Miami Vice'' and ``Family Ties'' already had been announced as
leaving this season after lengthy runs.
   The new season is scheduled to begin Sept. 18. ABC and CBS are
due to announce their schedules next week.
   Here is NBC's 1989-90 prime-time schedule, night by night:
   MONDAY: ``ALF,'' ``The Hogan Family,'' ``NBC Monday Night at the
Movies.''
   TUESDAY: ``Matlock,'' ``In the Heat of the Night,'' ``Midnight
Caller.''
   WEDNESDAY: ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' ``Night Court,'' ``Nutt
House,'' ``Quantum Leap.''
   THURSDAY: ``The Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World,'' ``Cheers,''
``Dear John,'' ``L.A. Law.''
   FRIDAY: ``Baywatch,'' ``Hardball,'' ``Mancuso, FBI.''
   SATURDAY: ``227,'' ``Amen,'' ``Golden Girls,'' ``Empty Nest,''
``Hunter.''
   SUNDAY: ``The Magical World of Disney,'' ``Sister Kate,'' ``My
Two Dads,'' ``NBC Sunday Night at the Movies.''

   Weapons charges against an attorney who
claimed authorities entrapped him in a federally financed
undercover drug investigation were dismissed Monday by a judge who
found governmental misconduct in the case.
   The judge said law enforcement officers should not have filed
false charges against an undercover sheriff's deputy so he could
hire attorney Robin Auld of Durango to represent him as part of the
operation.
   Filing the false affidavits was ``an impermissible taint upon
the integrity and impartiality of the courts,'' Judge Richard Brown
wrote.
   Auld said he was ``very happy'' with Brown's ruling but didn't
want to comment further because of a possible appeal by Keith
Cross, the special prosecutor in the case.
   A notice of claim seeking at least $1 million in civil damages
has been filed on Auld's behalf, but the attorney has not yet
brought a formal lawsuit. The government plan had called for the
undercover officer to pay Auld in drugs for his legal services, and
then pressure Auld to ``set up'' drug traffickers in southwest
Colorado, testimony in previous hearings showed.
   Auld, 43, refused to accept drugs but later took possession of
an Uzi machine gun, testimony showed. The prosecution charged he
took the gun as payment; Auld contends he kept it as collateral.
   The gun belonged to the Durango Police Department on loan from
the FBI, according to court documents.
   Auld's trial was to have started next Monday in Durango.
   Brown, who heard the case after 6th Judicial District judges in
Durango disqualified themselves, said law enforcement officials may
have committed perjury when they filed the false charges as part of
their operation.
   ``This court is not aware of any case or statute which sanctions
the filing of false and perjured documents in an official court
proceeding as part of an undercover operation,'' Brown wrote.
   ``The public has a right to demand and to expect that the courts
will do their utmost to remain impartial and to promote the
public's confidence in the integrity of the courts,'' Brown said.
   ``It takes guts but it's the right thing. He (Brown) wouldn't
put up with the corruption of court records,'' said Hal Haddon of
Denver, Auld's defense lawyer.
   Cross, the special prosecutor, said he will appeal.
   ``If this decision stands, it means the attorney never has to
face a jury on fairly serious charges,'' Cross said.
   Cross said he considered the false affidavits before he charged
Auld with theft by receiving and possession of a dangerous weapon.
   ``In my opinion, there were no indictable offenses committed by
the DA or law enforcement officials,'' Cross said. ``There is no
question that two documents filed and sworn to weren't true, but I
believe there is a difference in doing that and taking the stand
and perjuring themselves.''
   The operation was conducted as part of a $70,000 drug program
funded by the federal government, testimony showed.

<HEAD>House Rubber Stamps Senate Vote to Delay Ethics Regulations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Monday to go along with the
Senate and delay by 60 days the implementation of ethics
regulations that a number of federal officials have blamed for
their decisions to resign.
   The rules were scheduled to take effect Tuesday, but the House
action passed by unanimous consent delays the trigger date until
mid-July, a congressional source said.
   The Senate passed the same measure by unanimous consent last
Friday.
   The ethics regulations were cited as the reason for the
retirement last week of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's acting chief of the space station, Thomas L. Moser.
   Other officials at NASA and other federal agencies also have
announced their retirements in recent weeks to avoid being covered
by the new rules.
   The regulations would ban federal contractors from hiring
government officials who have supervised their competitors'
projects, subject to maximum fines of $1 million and imprisonment
of up to five years.
   The administration sought the delay because people need to be
trained and informed as to how the new rules, which were published
just last week, would be implemented, the source said.
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., sponsored the delaying measure
but wasn't present for the consent agreement, the source said.

<TEXT>
   When the civil war broke out in April
1975, I wondered how many months it would last. Fourteen years
later, I wonder if it will ever end.
   In 1975, my colleagues in The Associated Press and I huddled
under desks as rockets tore through the office. Last week, we were
again sprawled beneath our metal desks as shells exploded around us.
   The AP has been shelled out of four offices through the years of
bombardment, invasions and sieges, car bombings and assassinations.
   For the last two months, army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's
mainly Christian forces have battled the powerful Syrian army and
its Moslem allies in a quixotic crusade to force the Syrians out of
Lebanon and try to reunite a country dismembered into sectarian
fiefdoms.
   More than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded
in indiscriminate artillery, rocket and tank barrages that began
March 8.
   That doesn't compare with the savage battles at the start of the
war, when more than 100 people were killed daily. Since the war
began, an estimated 150,000 people have been killed, twice as many
have been wounded.
   The economy is in tatters.
   One quarter of the pre-war population of 4 million has fled.
Others are leaving every day now to start anew somewhere else with
whatever assets they can salvage.
   For many Lebanese, the latest fighting has forced them to cower
in underground shelters without sleep, electricity, running water
or decent food. Their children weep in fear.
   It has been the final descent into terror and degradation.
   Since the war began, I've seen the Syrian army come and go and
return, the Israelis invade and withdraw, U.S. Marines come ashore
to join French foreign legionnaires, plumed Italian Bersaglieri
troops and British paratroopers in an ill-fated effort to bring
peace.
   But Lebanon's warlords, and the Arab governments who for their
own reasons aid and arm them, defied them all to go on waging the
suicidal conflicts that have left the country in ruins.
   When the Americans and the Multi-National Force eventually
withdrew in 1984, with hundreds of their men killed or wounded by
suicide car bombers, everyone thought things had hit rock bottom.
   But the current fighting has been far more demoralizing because
it has demonstrated with such destructive force that nothing has
changed and probably never will.
   On both sides of Beirut's dividing Green Line, Christians and
Moslems speak of their disgust at the carnage and bemoan a future
seemingly without hope.
   Beirut was once the most glamorous capital in the Middle East
and bustled with thousands of Western businessmen and fun-seeking
Arab oil shieks lured by the great beachside casino and luxury
hotels.
   Now, it is shrouded in despair.
   For nearly a decade and a half, the Lebanese have picked
themselves up after every catastrophe and somehow found the will to
rebuild, patch up their lives and businesses and carry on.
   That remarkable spirit is almost drained. Everyone has had
enough.
   The war, with its undertones of medieval religious conflicts and
endless factional feuds on both sides of the sectarian divide, has
become as incomprehensible to the average Lebanese as it has long
been to the outside world.
   There are no heroes or villains, no winners or losers any more.
Only victims.
   The carnage is all-embracing. President-elect Bashir Gemayel,
Prime Minister Rashid Karami, warlords, legislators and poets have
perished in the Lebanese bloodbath along with thousand upon
thousand of helpless civilians.
   For the estimated 1 million Christians, the last few weeks have
most traumatic. They have been bombarded day and night in their
shrunken coastal enclave north of Beirut by Syria's big guns.
   Beleaguered and outnumbered, Aoun has refused to back down from
his battle to rid Lebanon of Syrian forces.
   The Syrians and their Moslem allies want the Christians, who
have dominated government, the judiciary and the army since
independence from France in 1943, to share power with the Moslems.
   For many Christians, particularly the dominant Maronite Catholic
sect, this means Syrian overlordship and the surrender of their
traditional privileges.
   Nothing has escaped the latest shelling. Churches, hospitals,
schools, apartment blocks, factories, power stations, fuel depots
and even shepherds in their fields in the hills above Beirut have
all been hit.
   Thousands of homes in west Beirut, including my apartment, have
been devastated. Every day we hear of friends killed, neighbors
buried beneath the rubble of their homes, whole families wiped out.
   We have no electricity or running water.
   Hospitals are running short of medicine.
   The power stations ran out of fuel for their generators weeks
ago. The last fuel supplies went up in flames when Syrian shells
destroyed the main depot in east Beirut.
   The French, the only Europeans to significantly respond to
Aoun's appeals for aid, sent 6,000 tons of fuel. That was enough to
provide power for about 2 million Lebanese for two hours a day for
10 days.
   Everyone has seen worse.
   The current violence _ frightful though it is _ is nothing
compared to the destruction wrought by the Israelis when they
invaded 1982 and besieged the Moslem sector, or compared to the the
colossal losses of 1975-76.
   Christian sources say Aoun has come to realize that his
David-and-Goliath war against the Syrians is unwinnable. He is
having to make most of the concessions to help the Arab League
enforce a cease-fire and end the carnage.
   Many support the general, who is aided by Iraqi weapons, for
finally standing up to the Syrians, not just for the Christians but
also for Moslems who would rather see them gone as well.
   But many of Aoun's people are increasingly critical of why he
decided to fight in the first place, embarking on what many see as
a reckless, impetuous crusade against a foe 10 times as powerful.
   But the 54-year-old general, a U.S.-trained artillery officer
many Christians now call ``Napol-Aoun,'' cannot back down without
surrending the besieged Christians' last card.
   Equally, Syria's President Hafez Assad, beset by political and
economic problems, cannot meekly march his troops out of a country
the Syrians consider their own backyard without a loss of face in
the Arab world.
   For the Lebanese, this means a future _ if such is the word _
that holds only more misery, destruction and savagery.

<HEAD>Initiative to Limit Downtown Seattle Growth on Ballot Tuesday</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank
Building was completed in 1969, it towered over the downtown area
like a lone Douglas fir over a stand of alder.
   Today, the same building is lost in a skyscraper forest, and
critics of the city's ``Manhattanization'' are pressing voters
Tuesday to approve size limits on new downtown buildings.
   In a city often touted as one of the most livable in the nation,
much of downtown has been cast into shadow, cut off from sunny-day
vistas of Mount Rainier, Puget Sound and the Olympic and Cascade
mountains.
   Backers of Tuesday's CAP referendum, for Citizens Alternative
Plan, say they are trying to preserve a way of life. Most
developers and business boosters fear Seattle's boom could be
chased away.
   The 500-foot, 42-story Smith Tower, the tallest building west of
the Mississippi River when it was built in 1914, was once a source
of pride. The 975-foot, 76-story Columbia Center, now the West
Coast's tallest, has come to symbolize what some feel is runaway
downtown growth at the expense of the rest of the city. Office
space has virtually doubled in the past decade, and traffic
problems and other signs of congestion are increasing.
   The citizens' initiative would set limits on downtown
development for 10 years and clamps a 450-foot lid on new buildings.
   City Councilman Jim Street says he sees the main impact of CAP
as ``a message ... that the people of this city want better growth
management.'' Peter Steinbrueck, an architect and CAP campaign
leader, agreed that the major effect may be ``symbolic.''
   But John Gilmore, executive director of the Downtown Seattle
Association, which opposes the initiative, said the effect could be
more than symbolic. ``I don't think this is a `message' at all,''
he said. ``This is a 10-year plan that controls what happens
downtown.''
   CAP's potential effect is as unclear as the impact of its chief
model, Proposition M, approved by San Francisco voters in 1986.
With buildings now under construction, projects allowed under
permits issued before the initiative was filed and the limited
development permitted by CAP, the skyline could go up for years,
many observers say.
   Mayor Charles Royer, a CAP opponent, says that in California
there have been ``more than 200 of these slow-growth or no-growth
initiatives, and they really haven't had much effect.''
   CAP backers, including the Sierra Club, Church Council of
Greater Seattle, League of Women Voters, Puget Sound Council of
Senior Citizens and Allied Arts of Seattle Inc., have raised about
$14,000 while opponents have nearly $180,000, campaign spending
reports show.
   Nonetheless, supporters and even some opponents expect CAP to
win at the polls.
   ``There is an emotional appeal on the other side that is very
difficult to overcome,'' said Walt Crowley, chairman of the
anti-CAP Citizens for a Better Downtown.
   That appeal is ``a reaction against growth, a fear of change
that we all feel to some degree or another, because change itself
is fundamentally disturbing,'' said Crowley, a KIRO-TV commentator.
   Key provisions include the height limit _ about 38 stories, with
a 500,000-square-foot limit on annual construction of office space
for the first five years and double that amount in the second five.
   Buildings of 50,000 square feet or less would be exempt from the
square footage limit.
   The city's leading developer, Martin Selig, whose projects
include the 76-story Columbia Center, figures CAP would affect
development by ``about 8 percent ... in what you can build on a
given site.''
   The City Council has adopted temporary, less restrictive growth
controls to take effect if CAP is rejected, leading City Council
member Paul Kraabel to conclude, ``I think the philosophy of it has
already won.''
   Seattle's current downtown zoning plan, which includes only
indirect controls on building height and no construction volume
limits, was adopted in 1985 after 4{ years of debate.

<HEAD>Baker Says Soviets Have no Choice on SS-23 Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says the
Soviet threat to stop destroying its SS-23 missiles would violate
an arms control treaty and appeared to be part of a publicity
campaign to divide NATO.
   The Soviets agreed to destroy the SS-23s, along with five other
types of missiles, in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force Treaty
that was signed in December 1987 and went into effect last June,
said Baker.
   ``This is a matter that was specifically negotiated when the INF
Treaty was negotiated,'' he said.
   ``The elimination of the SS-23s on the part of the Soviet Union
... was debated back and forth for quite some time. The Soviets
responded in effect that they would agree to eliminate these
missiles, and now they are doing so,'' Baker said Sunday on the
CBS-TV interview program, ``Face the Nation.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, visiting Bonn on
Saturday, warned that if Washington did not drop plans to modernize
its short-range Lance missile, the Soviet Union would respond by
developing a new short-range weapon or by retaining the SS-23s,
which have a range near the 300-mile limit imposed by the treaty.
   The Soviet Union has deployed the SS-23@Spider since 1985 as a
replacement to the 1960s vintage SCUD missile, and has about 75
Spiders in the Soviet Union and East Germany, according to the
Pentagon. The INF treaty calls for the Kremlin to destroy all the
SS-23s by October 1989.
   The INF pact required the superpowers to destroy all missiles
with ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles, but did not cover the Lance,
which has a shorter range.
   The United States has deferred until 1992 plans to modernize and
replace the 88 Lance missiles it has in West Germany, but has
resisted West German and Soviet pressure to begin immediate
negotiations on that class of weapons.
   Baker repeated the U.S. position not to negotiate the reduction
or elimination of short-range weapons with the Soviets until
completion of talks designed to reduced the significant Warsaw Pact
advantage in conventional arms in Europe.
   ``What they'd much prefer to see is the entire denuclearization
of Europe,'' Baker said.
   Shevardnadze's comment, Baker said, could be seen as a public
relations ploy designed to weaken the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   ``It would be a terrible mistake if we fall into the trap of
playing politics with Western security,'' he said. ``And the
Russians would love, dearly love to see that happen. They'd love to
see us do that and start trying to play that game.
   ``We don't need to be concerning ourselves with short-range
public opinion victories.''
   Baker welcomed the announcement by Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev that the Soviet Union would remove 500 short-range
missiles from Europe, but urged Moscow to eliminate more of the
weapons, in which the Soviets enjoy a 16-to-one advantage over NATO.
   ``The Soviets are coming our way,'' said Baker. ``For a long
time we've been calling on them to unilaterally reduce some of
their short-range nuclear weapons the way the NATO alliance has.''
   Over the past decade, he said, NATO has destroyed 2,400
short-range nuclear weapons without fanfare, whereas Gorbachev
announced only that the Soviets were removing 500 missiles from
Eastern Europe into European portions of the Soviet Union, within
access of the potential East-West battlefield.
   ``So we say, we say it's a good step, but it's a very small one
and a very modest one,'' said Baker.
   The Soviets have been modernizing their short-range missiles for
the past 10 years, Baker's deputy, Lawrence Eagleburger, said in a
separate interview on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week with David
Brinkley.''

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A brash new breed of independent
magazines and newspapers is setting a high standard for the
communist-run competition, which is scrambling to catch up with its
rivals' flashy design and bold content.
   Daring reports in such journals as Reform, a colorful weekly
tabloid, and Kapu, a cultural monthly, have created a competitive
atmosphere that has affected the older Communist Party organs _
making it tougher for state censors to muzzle reporting.
   The new fondness for scooping the competition has spread to the
broadcast media. The result has been coverage that would have been
unthinkable a few years ago, such as last month's televised
interview with Alexander Dubcek, the father of Czechoslovakia's
1968 reform movement.
   In the first week of May, official radio broadcast an old speech
by Imre Nagy, premier during Hungary's 1956 anti-Soviet uprising,
announcing that Kremlin tanks had entered Budapest.
   Official tolerance of independent journals is one of the most
visible consequences of reforms introduced during the past year by
the Hungarian leadership, which is attempting to bolster its
popular support as it introduces a multiparty electoral system.
   Despite changes that have removed barriers to criticism of party
policies and inspired more public participation in national
affairs, editors complain that their reports continue to be stifled
by a chronic paper shortage and a state monopoly on distribution
networks.
   A new political weekly called World, which is due out this
month, aspires to become a Hungarian equivalent to Time magazine or
West Germany's Der Spiegel.
   But the printing and publishing vagaries of the East bloc
require the glossy cover to be submitted three weeks in advance, a
drawback for a weekly that wants to chart the rapidly changing
course of Hungarian politics.
   Vilag, founded by young journalists disillusioned with their
jobs at the Communist Party youth weekly Oetlet, operates out of a
former army barracks and was still waiting for telephones to be
installed less than three weeks before its first issue was due out
May 25.
   Ilona Kocsi, a deputy editor, said the more open political
situation has made Vilag possible.
   The staff is reform-oriented, and she said the weekly,
underwritten by a group of private investors, would be independent.
   Peter Toeke, editor of the popular tabloid Reform, says he does
not feel threatened by Vilag because the newspaper's 350,000-issue
press run regularly sells out and is estimated to reach 1 million
readers.
   He described the publication he founded as ``centrist without
being partisan'' and supportive of the reform wing of the Communist
Party.
   Critics say Reform practices fast-food journalism because it
sandwiches politics between popular features, fashion and gossip.
But Toeke says that mixture is the reason for Reform's success.
   The effect of the independent media is felt by journalists at
long established newspapers and journals.
   Even the weekly economic journal HVG, one of the most outspoken
before Hungary's media landscape began to change, is feeling the
pressure.
   ``The critical boldness characteristic of HVG in the past has
become characteristic of essentially all the serious
publications,'' said Endre Babus, a journalist at HVG.
   Babus said the weekly, recently converted to private ownership,
was weighing whether to become a political weekly or to focus on
economics to appeal to managers operating within Hungary's
increasingly market-oriented economy.
   While the competition has had its pluses for some official
media, it has also inflicted some damage. The Communist Party daily
Nepszabadsag has lost 200,000 in circulation since the beginning of
the year.
   The afternoon daily Mai Nap is the only independent daily
newspaper to have appeared so far. But many of the independent
groups and fledgling parties have announced their intention to
establish their own dailies.
   Kapu, a monthly devoted to culture and politics, is considering
a daily publication and has taken steps to overcome the paper
shortage and post office distribution monopoly.
   One of the shareholders of Kapu is to be a West German paper
manufacturer, and the editor in chief, Zoltan Brady, said he has
contacted other editors to explore the possibility of setting up an
independent distributor.
   Since its first press run of 26,000 issues in September, the
magazine has tested the outer limits of Hungary's openness
policies, and its growing popularity is illustrated by publication
now at 100,000.
   Kapu was the first to publish the names of those executed after
the 1956 revolt, and it carried excerpts from the memoirs of a
former Romanian spy published in the West. That series was halted,
however, when Romania threatened to break off diplomatic relations.
   Brady himself was long blacklisted, had his passport revoked and
spent 80 days in prison two years ago for a series he did on
corruption.

<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A herd of llamas and alpacas en route
to the United States from the cold high Andes of Chile has been
stranded for seven weeks in the heat of a barren Caribbean island.
   Seventy-five of the woolly beasts have perished, mostly from the
heat and stress.
   The 178 survivors are awaiting delivery to American buyers as
trendy pets, pack animals or breeding stock in a $2-million export
deal.
   But they have been held up by U.S. regulations on foot and mouth
disease and have become the center of a feud involving
animal-welfare activists, the Antiguan government and the U.S.
investors.
   In all, 268 llamas and alpacas were shipped, but 15 died in a
crating accident aboard a Bolivian cargo plane on takeoff from
Chile.
   After the remaining 253 arrived in the twin nation of Antigua
and Barbuda, about 250 miles east of Puerto Rico, residents
protesting their presence on Barbuda blocked a quarantine station
and forced the herd onto uninhabited Billy Island off Antigua.
   ``Straight from the beginning it was a fiasco,'' said John
Walsh, regional director in Boston of the London-based World
Society for the Protection of Animals, which monitors the
commercial use of animals. ``In my view, it shows a lack of concern
for the animals.''
   At one stage, the beasts, which belong to the camel family but
have no hump, were dying at a rate of two a day on Billy Island, a
hill of coral rock, scrub brush and a few scrawny trees.
   Because llamas and alpacas live above the treeline in the Andes,
they have no instinct to seek shade and succumbed in temperatures
hitting the mid-80s.
   ``They really were just dropping like flies because of the
heat,'' said John Schartner, a scuba-diving instructor hired to
camp out on the island and care for the animals. ``They didn't know
enough to get in the shade. Most of them would just lie out and
bake in the sun.''
   Since then, workers have built shelters with blue plastic
tarpaulins to shade the herd, and set up a supply line of hay and
fresh water brought from Antigua in 55-gallon drums. Intravenous
tubes and spray pumps were used to rehydrate the animals.
   Paula Vachon of Sarasota, Fla., one of the four partners in the
export deal who has been supervising the operation in Antigua, said
only one animal had died this month _ a llama with a leg cut that
got infected.
   The llamas and alpacas were brought to Antigua and Barbuda by
two Florida businessmen, David Strickland and Keith Kerr. Another
partner is Kerr's wife, Diane.
   Strickland, a Sarasota developer, has been doing business in
Antigua and Barbuda for 17 years. Kerr, who owns a construction
company in Palmetto, Fla., has a 12-acre private zoo that includes
lions, tigers, cougars, bears, wolves, bobcats and an 8-year-old
elephant.
   Strickland said the partners bought the exotic creatures in
Chile for $50 to $120 each and hoped to sell them for $6,500 to
$15,000 each. The deal would have netted a profit of around $2
million, he said.
   The International Llama Association estimates there are 25,000
llamas and 1,000 of the smaller alpacas in the United States.
   In recent years, the graceful, mild-natured creatures with
thick, woolly coats, have become increasingly popular and valuable.
Males typically sell for $10,000 and breeding females $30,000, but
prices vary greatly. A prize stud reportedly sold for $115,000 last
year.
   Strickland said the idea was to export llamas and alpacas to pay
for both a wildlife park in Antigua and a $450,000 quarantine
station the investors built on Barbuda.
   The project went awry when a barge carrying the llamas and
alpacas arrived off Barbuda on March 23. An unruly crowd formed and
refused to allow the vessel to unload.
   Underlying the protest was local hostility to a cement company
Strickland owns with Deputy Prime Minister Lester Bird of Antigua
and two other Cabinet ministers. The company uses sand from Barbuda
in construction.
   The main problem for the animals now is that the exporters
shipped them from Chile and brought them to Antigua, and neither
country is regarded by the U.S. government as free of
foot-and-mouth disease, a contagious virus that can devastate
livestock.
   The animals have been inspected by a veterinarian from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, but they cannot enter the United States
without undergoing a 90-day quarantine. The only approved facility,
the Harry S. Truman Animal Import Center in Fleming Key, Fla., is
booked through the end of September with a shipment of Chinese pigs.
   Llama association president Fred Bauer accused the exporters of
trying to circumvent USDA regulations by setting up an unauthorized
quarantine station. ``Nothing seems to ring quite true with this
deal,'' he said.
   Francie Stull, who raises Russian wolfhounds near Austin, Texas,
bought 160 of the animals from the Florida investors for more than
$1 million and has already pre-sold 49 of them for about $500,000.
   She said she was unaware until this past September that Antigua
had not done the necessary screening to be declared free of
foot-and-mouth disease but had been assured there would be no
problem in obtaining the status.
   Asked what was likely to happen to the animals, she said: ``My
best guess is that they will be put in some kind of facility where
they are comfortable and be used as a breeder herd for the next
couple of years while we negotiate the red tape.''
   Mrs. Stull said she had fully insured her animals, but
Strickland said the rest of the herd was not covered. He said the
partners stood to lose $1.3 million if the animals cannot be
brought into the United States.
   The government here has agreed to allow construction of another
quarantine station, this one on a peninsula of Antigua, along with
the promised wildlife park as a tourist attraction.
   ``We don't want these animals to suffer anymore,'' said
government spokesman Barry Stevens. ``They've been brought here,
and there's nowhere else for the them to go. Now, we've got to
salvage the situation.''

<HEAD>Americans in TWA Hijack Case Look to Hamadi's Ultimate Fate</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 16 Americans who helped
prosecute Mohammed Ali Hamadi are looking past the verdict to the
hijacker's ultimate fate and are wary of political deals that might
free him.
   Hamadi admits taking part in the TWA hijacking four years ago in
which 39 Americans were held hostage 17 days, but he denies killing
Robert Stethem, one of six U.S. Navy divers aboard.
   The hijackers threw Stethem, 23, from the plane, and a picture
of his swollen, bloodstained body appeared in newspapers throughout
the world.
   Falk Thomas, spokesman for the Frankfurt district court, said
West German authorities acted as ``representatives of the civilized
world'' in prosecuting the young Shiite Moslem. A verdict is
scheduled Wednesday.
   The ever-present danger of reprisals against West Germans formed
the backdrop for the trial, which began July 5, 1988.
   Rainer Hamm, a prominent Frankfurt lawyer who represents the
Americans, said the danger was not likely to abate with the court
weighing whether to impose the life prison sentence that
prosecutors requested. Life in prison is the maximum penalty Hamadi
could receive under West German law.
   Hamm noted that West German relief worker Markus Quint, who
disappeared in Lebanon on May 4, had reportedly been held by
kidnappers seeking lenient treatment for Hamadi. No group claimed
to have abducted Quint, who reappeared Sunday.
   The Americans ``of course hope there are no secret deals that,
for example, would have him (Hamadi) deported back to his home
country of Lebanon toward the latter part of his sentence,'' Hamm
said in an interview.
   Hamm represents chief flight attendant Uli Derickson and other
crew members, the Navy divers and members of the Stethem family.
Many of his 16 clients testified at the trial.
   Frankfurt prosecutors formally notified all those who had been
held on the plane, and the Stethem family, of their legal right to
take part in the case as co-prosecutors, and 16 decided to do so.
   As their lawyer, Hamm frequently questioned witnesses and Hamadi
himself. The torture of Stethem by Hamadi and his accomplice was
the focal point of the long trial. Witnesses gave repeated accounts
of the sadistic pleasure Hamadi appeared to take in beating the
diver and other passengers.
   John Testrake of Richmond, Mo., the pilot, testified in
September: ``It appeared that one of the hijackers (Hamadi) enjoyed
beating the passengers ... to inflict violence when no violence was
called for.''
   Richard and Patricia Stethem attended every court session,
silently listening to accounts of their son's agonizing final
hours. Only occasionally did they lose their composure. Mrs.
Stethem unexpectedly walked out of the courtroom in April during
testimony about details of her son's murder.
   Two other men also were subjected to savage beatings after the
plane was hijacked June 14, 1985, on a flight from Athens to Rome
and diverted to Beirut.
   Kurt Carlson of Rockford, Ill., ``prayed to God'' to let him die
after Hamadi repeatedly struck him on the back with an arm rest.
The hijackers also viciously attacked Clinton Suggs of Elkhart,
Ind., another of the Navy divers.
   More than 100 witnesses testified at the trial in a heavily
guarded courtroom in Frankfurt's fortress-like Preungesheim prison.
   Hamadi, who prosecutors say is 24 years old, is charged with air
piracy and murder. A central question in the trial was whether he
was 21 at the time of the hijacking or should be sentenced as a
juvenile.
   He testified that the goal of the hijacking was to force the
release of Lebanese Moslems imprisoned in Israel. Shortly after the
Americans were freed, Israel released about 700 prisoners.
   Hamm said his clients fear that, because of such blackmail
situations as the reported Quint kidnapping, Hamadi ``could get off
more easily in Germany than he would have if, for example, he were
to have received a life term in the United States.''
   The United States requested Hamadi's extradition after he was
arrested January 13, 1987, at the Frankfurt airport. West Germany's
refusal strained the usually warm relations between the two
countries.
   Two West Germans were seized in Lebanon within a week of the
arrest and the kidnappers tried to arrange a trade. The hostages
finally were released.
   Rainer Mueller, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, called the trial
``a special point of danger for our citizens in Lebanon. It's known
that the Hamadi clan has certain influence in Lebanon.''
   Mueller said the number of West Germans still in Lebanon was
small.
   Once the Frankfurt court's decision is final, Hamm said, Hamadi
cannot be extradited to another country for trial on the same
charges.
   The Americans have the right to appeal if they are not satisfied
with the verdict, but Hamm said they ``will be satisfied with the
result of the trial if it corresponds to the sentence the
prosecutor has requested.''

   The first 30 citizen volunteers to form a New
York-style Guardian Angels chapter for patrolling London's subways
have been awarded their trademark red berets and T-shirts after a
three-month training course.
   The anti-crime group's American founder, Curtis Sliwa, made the
presentation Sunday during a ceremony in a pub in London's East End.
   Sliwa, who flew from New York for the graduation, told the
group: ``We must not play Rambo with criminals. We have to work
with the police and the Underground crews to show we are
responsible people and not vigilantes.''
   One Angel, 17-year-old mailman Bill Barnett, said: ``I wanted to
do a bit to help the community.''
   The eight women and 22 men, ages 16 to 45, were trained in
martial arts, first aid and law.
   Strikes disrupted service today so they were to start work
Tuesday, patrolling the Circle and District lines of the 237-mile
subway system.
   Sliwa said the Angels had been invited to patrol a north London
housing project and may also set up groups in Manchester, Liverpool
and Birmingham.

   An unexplained power failure left several
buildings at Kentucky State Reformatory without electricity for a
day, but there were no problems reported among the 1,500 inmates,
officials said Sunday.
   Prison spokeswoman Kathy McDaniel said various buildings in the
prison complex began experiencing periodic power failures Saturday
afternoon. At 7:30 p.m., everything went out, she said.
   By that time, inmates at the prison near Louisville had been fed
so all were sent back to their living quarters for a ``lockdown.''
Three of the 10 dormitories, an administration building and the
kitchen were still without power by midafternoon Sunday.
   Electricity was restored about 9:30 p.m., said Sgt. Rolland
Kaemerer. Officials had also isolated the area where the outage
occurred but were uncertain of its cause, he said.
   Emergency generators were used to supply power to some
buildings. Ten volunteer fire departments also were called in to
supply power for lights on the fence, and additional staff members
were called to duty during the emergency, Ms. McDaniel said.

<HEAD>`The Toughest Taskmaster in the Coast Guard' Battles Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE BARTLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sight is startling, yet somehow
reassuring: the slightly built man in blue scrambling across a
rugged beach, turning over rocks to see if oil is underneath.
   Clyde Robbins is not just one of the thousands of workers
cleaning up the nation's worst oil spill. He's the Coast Guard vice
admiral responsible for ensuring the work gets done.
   When Adm. Paul Yost Jr., the Coast Guard commandant, appointed
him, he described Robbins as ``the toughest taskmaster in the Coast
Guard.''
   The task facing Robbins is formidable. He encounters a daily
crush of decisions on how best to cleanse Alaska's scenic
wonderland of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil, spilled when
the Exxon Valdez struck a reef March 24 in Prince William Sound.
   Oil has fouled shores and islands and spread 450 miles southwest
of Valdez, killing thousands of birds and hundreds of otters.
   With mandatory retirement looming next year, Robbins sees the
cleanup as the ``final exam'' in his 35-year career.
   ``I'd say it's pretty close to the toughest, if not the toughest
assignment I've ever had,'' he said.
   It's not the first time Robbins, the Coast Guard's third-ranking
officer, has had to deal with the messy aftermath of an oil spill.
   During his two-year stint in the early 1970s as captain of the
port of Galveston, Texas, Robbins faced similar crises.
   One involved a tanker that struck an oil platform and caught
fire. The chore of unloading the tanker without it breaking up and
sinking was complicated by a hurricane.
   ``It was like God was standing up there saying `Let's throw
something else at him,''' Robbins recalled.
   Later, a barge dumped millions of gallons of crude that washed
up on the shores of Galveston Bay. He said that cleanup ``was like
a mini-exercise leading up to this one.''
   Robbins is a hands-on administrator.
   ``I feel a very great responsibility to personally eyeball the
sites and see how things are going,'' said Robbins, who on Thursday
spent six hours visiting rocky islands normally inhabited only by
seals.
   His typical day begins at 6 a.m. and ends at 11 p.m.
   ``He is a taskmaster, but he's a good guy to work for,'' said
Coast Guard Capt. David Zawadzki, commander of the Marine Safety
Office in Alameda, Calif., who is serving as Robbins' chief of
staff.
   The taskmaster reputation is complimentary rather than
derogatory, said Cmdr. Mike Donohoe, head of the Marine Safety
Office in Memphis, Tenn. ``He lets you know what he wants and he
expects you to deliver.''
   Alaska officials who work daily with Robbins seem to agree.
   ``He's out in the field, very active,'' said Larry Dietrich, the
Department of Environmental Conservation's man in charge in Valdez.
``I think he's been very straightforward.''
   Even Exxon officials, whom he has criticized, have respect for
him.
   ``His dealings with Exxon have been tough, but fair,'' said Otto
Harrison, Exxon's top executive in Valdez.
   Robbins projects an image of even-handedness, quickly
challenging unsubstantiated allegations of spreading oil or
questionable cleanup techniques. While conceding he has his
differences with Exxon, Robbins is quick to defend the company's
effort and commitment.
   ``I have worked a number of spills in the past where the company
did not accept the responsibility,'' he said. ``I think they have a
moral obligation to do it (the cleanup), and I think they feel it,
too. I wish we could avoid the finger-pointing. Certainly everybody
is a little bit to blame.''
   Robbins said complacency set in at all levels with a decrease in
the number of spills in recent years.
   Then, he said, ``We got hit with this shocker.''
   Robbins, 58, grew up in the tiny farming community of Columbia
Cross Roads, Pa.
   His goal was aviation, but when he found he needed to go to
college to qualify for Navy flight school, he was drawn to an ad
that offered a free education in the Coast Guard Academy.
   After spending what he calls a boring 1{ years at sea, as
required of all academy graduates, Robbins got to fly.
   For the next 18 years, he flew everything the Coast Guard had to
offer, from amphibious planes to helicopters to the executive jet
used to fly the brass around.
   His love of flying was inherited by his son, Jmes, who flies
C-130s for the Coast Guard. James is to be transferred to Kodiak
next week, and Robbins said he's looking forward to flying with him.
   The Alaska shoreline cannot be restored to its previously
untarnished condition, Robbins said.
   ``Once the spill occurred, the fat was in the fire,'' he said.
``These beaches are never going to be squeaky clean.''

<TEXT>
   In Panama, all television stations
but one are controlled by the government. But it's a big exception
_ Channel 8, the U.S. armed forces station.
   Panamanians avidly watch the armed forces station for news they
can't get otherwise. Occasional jamming of news programs doesn't
squelch the sound, and entertainment is never blocked.
   Sometimes it seems the two sides are having a war of the
crawlers _ messages that crawl along the bottom of the screen.
   ``Attention. PML (personnel movement limitation) Charlie is in
effect. Limit movement. Do not go into public areas of Panama
except on official business,'' Channel 8 advised viewers of
``Little House on the Prairie''.
   ``The nation is in a state of intense calm. Do not believe the
provocative statements being broadcast on Channel 8,'' countered
Channel 2, which was showing a film about U.S. interventionism.
   ``Do not go to the Amador Causeway between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.
because of a political rally,'' crawled along the bottom of ``Now
You're in Heaven,'' a Julian Lennon video played on Channel 8 early
Sunday morning.
   Viewers of a Spanish-dubbed ``Flipper'' rerun on Channel 2 were
told to ``Come to the Amador Causeway between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.
Sunday for a festival of Cuban music and dance.''
   Reporters who followed that advice found the causeway crowded
with people listening to music at a government-sponsored festival.
   But perhaps the most enigmatic message came on the government's
Channel 2.
   Channel 2 was probably winning the Sunday afternoon ratings race
with a live broadcast of the Los Angeles Lakers-Seattle Supersonics
pro basketball playoff game when this crawler appeared:
   ``A severe thunderstorm warning is in effect for Crowley,
Elbert, Kiowa, El Paso, Lincoln, Otero and Pueblo counties.''

   Some U.S. servicemen who know their way around Panama are
apparently not impressed with regulations limiting their movements.
   Nor are they very worried about encountering hostile
Panamanians, despite a drumbeat of anti-U.S. propaganda _ a
drumbeat that has lightened in the last few days.
   ``All that stuff you've seen on TV, I've never seen any of it,''
said one serviceman who has been in Panama for more than two years.
   He and a friend were encountered with their Panamanian
girlfriends after midnight on a street in an affluent part of the
capital, discussing whether to make a night of it at a local disco.
   Both admitted they were off-post without authorization, but said
it would be no problem to return.
   ``You don't go downtown during political demonstrations. You
travel at lunch and dinnertime when there are fewer checkpoints,''
he said. ``They might hassle you, but they never do anything.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Checkpoint stories are a staple of journalistic conversation.
While some journalists have been taken to police stations and
questioned, most checks are correct and efficient.
   Last Wednesday, the day opposition presidential candidates were
beaten by supporters of Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, a reporter at one such checkpoint was questioned about a
gas mask.
   ``What's this for?,'' asked a soldier.
   ``Tear gas,'' was the reply.
   ``Where would they be throwing tear gas in Panama?'' the soldier
asked in an indignant tone.
   ``Well, today it was on the Via Espana,'' the reporter replied.
   ``Oh,'' said the soldier, and returned the mask.
   At another checkpoint, with lights flashing oddly and cigarettes
glinting in the night, a grim officer checked a reporter's notes
carefully, then reached further into the reporter's bag.
   ``What's this?'' he barked.
   The object was a paperback book, Nobel prizewinner Saul Bellow's
latest novella, ``A Theft.''
   ``Oh, he's very good,'' the officer said, suddenly breaking into
fluent English. ``Have you read it yet?''
   The reporter had to confess that he had yet to open it.

   Tens of thousands of students demonstrating for
democracy refused to vacate Tiananmen Square Monday, forcing the
government to relocate its welcoming ceremony for Mikhail Gorbachev.
   An elaborate ceremony had been planned to officially welcome the
Soviet president at the vast square in central Beijing. But
authorities feared a major disruption by the students, who vowed to
give Gorbachev their own welcome.
   Gorbachev was welcomed instead at the Beijing airport, where he
arrived at noon (11 p.m. EDT Sunday) for the first Sino-Soviet
summit in 30 years. He and his wife Raisa were greeted by Chinese
President Yang Shangkun and a 21-gun salute.
   Hours earlier, the pro-democracy students, including nearly
2,000 hunger strikers, moved away from the center of the vast
square, where they had been camped for two days, in a sign of
respect for Gorbachev.
   Moving by groups in an orderly fashion, the students went toward
the Museum of Chinese History and the Revolution on the east side
of Tiananmen Square. The ceremony had been planned for the opposite
side of the square in front of the Great Hall of the People.
   Some students carried banners _ in both Russian and Chinese _
welcoming the Soviet leader.
   ``Welcome to a real reformer _ Gorbachev'' read one sign, while
another said, ``Welcome Gorbachev, speed up the reform process.''
   At the core of the defiant crowd were the hunger strikers, who
began their action Saturday.
   Earlier, a crowd estimated at 30,000 people gathered around the
hunger strikers and urged them to continue the fast. Many waved
banners and chanted ``Struggle until the end.''
   Two police deadlines for the students to depart passed quietly.
   Thousands of other people were in the huge square Monday
morning, some marching in support of the students and others just
watching the action.
   Among the groups backing the students were about 100 Beijing
residents who marched under a sign proclaiming themselves the
``Citizens Support Group'' and about 400 people who said they were
the ``Capital Worker Group.'' Both drew cheers.
   One woman said of the hunger strike, ``This will put pressure on
the Chinese government to learn from Gorbachev.'' Several students
carried posters with Gorbachev's portrait.
   Zhao, shaken by a month of protests by tens of thousands of
students in Beijing and other cities, said Sunday that officials
were considering ways to promote reform and combat official
corruption. He did not mention specific measures.
   A dozen leading intellectuals joined the students late Sunday
and made speeches of support.
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong and several other top officals drove
out to the square before dawn Sunday and urged students to leave
but gave up and left after a few minutes when the students shouted
them down.
   Education Minister Li Tieying and Minister of Supervision Yan
Mingfu, who hold top party posts, met with student representatives
Sunday. Talks ended after the government rejected demands that an
independent student group be recognized and that talks be broadcast.
   At least four hunger-striking students were carried away Sunday
afternoon and six were helped out by classmates. Students from the
Beijing Medical University who organized themselves as a first-aid
squad said the stricken students were suffering from dehydration
and too much sun.
   Late Sunday, eight doctors came and began administering glucose,
vitamins and salt tablets.
   Chinese journalists have been sympathetic to the protests. On
Sunday, in an unprecedented act defying state censorship, a liberal
Shanghai newspaper said it was threatening to sue its city
government because the mayor demanded changes in a May 15 edition.

1969 reunion.
   The crack campaign strategist said he was attending a meeting in

   ``I told them I would see if I could be available. A little

remarked that they had now `done it all but play at Carnegie Hall,'
and I called the people in New York, and they said I could bring my

ovarian cancer, says the struggle has made him appreciate life much
more.

   Wilder is busy promoting his new movie, ``See No Evil, Hear No

is ``more instinctively attuned to'' Pryor than any other actor.
   ``I don't know why it is,'' Wilder said in an interview in May
29's US magazine. ``I find that it's more sexual than it is
artistic, and when I say sexual, I mean the response is emotional:
pleasing, caring for each other.''
   Wilder said Radner's bout with cancer nearly drove him crazy.
   ``Only when I did the movie did my sanity start to come back,''

<DATELINE>NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mauritania is a schizophrenic
country straddling the Arab and black African worlds.
   It has embraced Arab brothers to the north in the new Union of
the Great Arab Maghreb, which has yet to yield major economic
benefits, and engaged in a bloody dispute with the blacks of
Senegal, its southern neighbor and largest African trading partner.
   One-third of Mauritania's people are of Arab-Berber extraction,
known as white Moors. They dominate the government and most of the
economy.
   Another third are Haratines, or black Moors, mixed-race
descendants of slaves who adopted Berber customs, and the final
third are blacks from the Senegal River region along the southern
border.
   Even as it turns north to Algeria, Tunisia and Libya in hopes of
turning the Maghreb into a mini-Common Market, Mauritania looks
with new interest to the south, where two new Senegal River dams
have created agricultural opportunities.
   In large measure, disagreements about territorial and farming
rights along the border river are at the root of recent ethnic
violence in Mauritania and Senegal that has cost an estimated 260
lives.
   Tens of thousands of people were repatriated to their respective
homelands by an air shuttle established at the height of the
trouble, which began with a minor border incident in April.
   The dispute with Senegal comes at a time of political and
economic change, both of which could be affected by it.
   Mauritania, an Islamic state governed by the Military Committee
for National Salvation, is making its first tentative steps toward
democracy. A few local elections were held in the past year and
nationwide municipal elections are the next step.
   Lt. Col. Maouya Ould Sidi-Ahmed Taya, the president, said in a
speech last month: ``An ephemeral democracy is not what we are
looking for. A healthy, efficient and durable democracy demands a
change in our mentality and the eradication of ignorance and other
social ills.''
   A multiparty system and real parliamentary democracy do not
appear likely in the immediate future.
   ``Total democracy? That depends on the situation,'' said
Information Minister Mustapha Ould Abedarrahman. ``The president is
a man of his word. Each time the context allows development of the
democratic process, it happens, but it is impossible to say how
long total democracy will take.''
   The economy also is being restructured, by agreement with the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About one-third of
the government-owned companies are being sold and others are being
reorganized.
   Restructuring combined with a 15 percent devaluation of the
currency has had its consequences. Many public jobs were eliminated
and a government fund has been estabalished to help those affected
find other work.
   Mauritania is a desert country, and with the Senegal River dams
in operation the government is giving land to any individual or
company willing to develop it.
   That has lured many white Moors never previously interested by
agriculture, and black farmers resent the intrusion.
   An unknown factor is the impact of the 50,000 Mauritanians
repatriated from Senegal, where most were small shopkeepers.
Resettling them will be a financial burden on the government, and
their return also means loss of the money they had sent home.
   Another question mark is fishing, which has overtaken iron
mining as Mauritania's largest income producer. Nearly all the
fishermen were Senegalese and nearly all fled, leaving the industry
in a shambles and fish markets nearly empty.
   Senegalese say a deep-seated racism among white Moors is at the
heart of the conflict. Mauritania denies it.
   In the 1960s, violence by southern blacks who feared further
Arabization was put down harshly and even discussion of race was
banned, but problems continue in a nation that did not abolish
slavery until 1980.
   The government claims to have eradicated the African Liberation
Forces of Mauritania, a black opposition group, except for a few
``troublemakers'' based in Dakar, capital of Senegal.
   After an attempted coup by the group's military wing in 1987,
two army officers were executed and others were jailed.
   Fear of impending racial conflict has caused many black
Mauritanians to flee Nouakchott for the southern border region,
where they are a majority.

Republicans muting their longstanding complaint that easy access
merely invites ballot fraud.
   ``We have the historic opportunity to get rid of the hoops so
many Americans have to jump through to get registered,'' declares
the bill's sponsor, Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash.
   Lawmakers say the aim is to increase voter turnout and open the
nation's elections to Americans unable to leave work and stand in
line at City Hall or merely too forgetful to register 30 days in
advance as required in some states.
   Advocates of change cite success in three states that allow
voters to register on election day, and they also point to North
Dakota, which has abolished voter registration altogether.
   Critics, however, say the largely rural states that have easy
registration lack much history of fraud, at least compared with the
checkered traditions of Chicago and other machine bastions where
ward bosses have counseled followers to vote early and vote often.
   Republicans signed on to Swift's bill after Democrats agreed to
provisions making it easier for state and local officials to purge
the rolls of people who have died or moved away.
   GOP members waved Swift's bill through the House Administration
Committee without a murmur of dissent two weeks ago, and it is now
headed for floor action.
   Although there are lingering GOP dissenters, many Republicans
now say their party stands to gain from expanded registration.
   They point to the results of eased laws in many places,
including California where voters can register while ordering
cheeseburgers at fast-food restaurants.
   ``The people coming into the Republican Party in the largest
numbers tend to be young professionals and executives who are very
mobile,'' says Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif.
   He says the Republican strategy is to ease the way for them as
well as college students whose political outlook was shaped in the
Reagan era.
   In the Senate, Rules Committee Chairman Wendell Ford, D-Ky., is
drawing up a similar bill. The unveiling is set for late July, with
no assurance of bipartisan support. But that could change if the
bill includes strong ``purging'' provisions designed to keep the
rolls clear of voters who have died or moved elsewhere.
   Such purging provisions, however, are unwelcome among civil
rights forces and are absent from a measure sponsored by Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., and being weighed by the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   That bill is sharply different from the House measure and has
triggered a touch of the old partisanship that once haunted the
issue.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R.-Ky., says the Cranston bill would
``open the democratic process up to vote buyers, tombstone voters,
multiple voters and hordes of illegal aliens who could be rounded
up on election day and paid to vote in our local, state and federal
elections.''
   Proponents say complex registration requirements now in force in
many states work the greatest hardship on minorities.
   Cranston's bill would require states where minority registration
rates drop sharply below those for non-minorities to submit a plan
for approval by the attorney general designed to overhaul their
procedures.
   One reason why House Republicans may be just as glad to leave
wrangling over voter registration to the Senate is that they are
saving ammunition for a debate over campaign finances expected
later in the session.
   Democrats are calling for action to close what they call the
``soft money loophole'' under which state and local committees of
political parties spend contributions to benefit presidential
candidates.
   The contributions are described as ``soft'' because they are not
subject to federal limits and reporting requirements.
Democratic-sponsored legislation now in the hopper would change
that.

<HEAD>Iowan Trying to Take Rodeo to Soviet Union</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cowboys mainly ride the range to sell
beer and cigarettes these days, but the Wild West still captures
the imagination of foreigners _ even in the Soviet Union, a rodeo
promoter says.
   Stephen Gander, who once staged a rodeo for former President
Reagan, hopes to have broncos bucking in a Moscow arena by the end
of next year.
   The cowboy as profession may have been consigned forever to
television advertisements, ``but when you leave the borders, the
American cowboy is the thing that other people identify with,''
Gander said. ``It's the most recognized symbol worldwide for the
United States.''
   Gander, 38, the producer of the World's Toughest Rodeo, is no
stranger to extravaganzas. In 1985, he sponsored a huge beach party
in the middle of Iowa by trucking in tons of sand to a grassy area
off a freeway.
   U.S. officials say Gander's rodeo would be one of the largest
cultural exchanges between the two countries since Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed an exchange initiative in
January 1986.
   ``If he can pull it off, it will be the first of its kind in the
Soviet Union,'' said Molly Raymond, deputy coordinator of the U.S.
Information Agency, which helps organize cultural exchanges.
   Gregory Guroff and Vyacheslav Sirotkin, officials of the Moscow
Circus, which toured the United States last year, were intrigued,
Gander said.
   ``I asked them, `Are you familiar with rodeos?' and Mr. Sirotkin
said, `Yes, Reagan's favorite sport.'''
   Gander rode the circuit for eight years and has produced rodeos
from Portland, Ore., to Madison Square Garden during the past
decade.
   In 1983, Gander co-produced a performance for Reagan and more
than 11,000 guests, including the Soviet ambassador.
   Gander should get official approval soon from the Soviet Union,
said USIA official Chris Kidder. But a corporate sponsor is still
needed.
   Then comes the hard part _ finding a way to move more than 100
animals and equipment to the Soviet Union for a three-to-four-week
stay, along with 70 cowboys and their gear.
   ``It's one thing to take a concert over there, you just have
your sound systems and that's it,'' Gander said.
   ``But in this particular case, we're talking about saddles,
riding chutes and other equipment, and maybe even a semitrailer
truck to haul the animals.''
   Eventually, Gander hopes to work out a reciprocal tour of U.S.
cities by either the Cossack Riders or the Soviet Horse Theatre.

   Mikhail Gorbachev, a new symbol of tolerance in
the Communist world, arrived Monday for a historic summit meeting
overshadowed by an impasse between Chinese officials and thousands
of students fasting for democratic reform.
   In a statement issued at a welcoming ceremony at Beijing's
airport, Gorbachev noted he was arriving in the springtime, a
season of ``renewal and hope,'' and expressed a wish that the first
Soviet-Chinese summit in 30 years would ``mark a watershed in
relations'' between the two Communist giants.
   ``We in the Soviet Union follow with keen interest the
transformations that are unfolding in China,'' the 58-year-old
leader said in the statement. He likely was referring to China's
decade-old economic reform, rather than the students' demands for
greater openness and a voice in government.
   The official welcoming ceremony, traditionally staged in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square, was abruptly moved to the airport
because tens of thousands of students, including about 2,000 hunger
strikers and their supporters, continued to occupy the square for a
third straight day.
   The students defied authorities, who set several deadlines for
clearing the broad plaza, and insisted they would carry on their
month-long campaign.
   Out of respect for Gorbachev, the students moved to a far side
of the famed square to leave room in front of the Great Hall of the
People, where the military ceremony had been planned. They even
used their banners to sweep up some of the litter from the protests.
   But officials abruptly moved the ceremony on two hours' notice,
and Gorbachev's motorcade into the city was rerouted to avoid the
demonstration. However, several thousand people, most of them
apparently not students, charged into the street in front of the
square where the motorcade was to have passed on its way to the
official guest house where Gorbachev is staying.
   Police shoved the people back, clearing half of the broad
boulevard. Soviet officials said Gorbachev reached the house
without incident, taking a different route.
   The Soviet leader, accompanied by his wife Raisa, arrived at
noon (11 p.m. Sunday EDT) for a four-day visit to Beijing and
Shanghai. He was greeted by President Yang Shangkun, reviewed the
military honor guard, and received a 21-gun salute.
   Gorbachev left Moscow Sunday and stopped overnight in the
Siberian city of Irkutsk before flying to Beijing to restore ties
that broke off in 1959 after a decade-long alliance between the
Communist giants.
   In Irkutsk, Gorbachev told a crowd of Soviets who gathered at
the airport that his trip would signal a warmer relationship
between the communist giants.
   Gorbachev said he did not want to talk about the years of
tension between the countries, but said ``our people and the
Chinese people preserved a feeling of respect and a wish to live
like good neighbors.'' His remarks were shown on the Soviet TV news
program ``Vremya.''
   The main business of the visit is expected to take place Tuesday
when Gorbachev holds talks with senior leader Deng Xiaoping and top
party and government officials.
   Deng, the venerable 84-year-old revolutionary, now frail and
semi-retired, has steered his country through a period of economic
reform that brought growth and Westernization. But along with the
reforms came inflation and dislocation that the government is
trying to control.
   Gorbachev also has spearheaded a movement to overhaul the
centralized Communist structure, but his economic measures have
been far more cautious and, to date, less effective than China's.
   The Soviets, however, have moved more dramatically to ease
restraints on public expression and have permitted competitive
elections and a level of democratization practically unheard of in
China.
   As a result, Gorbachev is seen as something of a hero to many of
the Chinese students, who have been demonstrating for a month to
press their demands for democracy and freedom.
   The last Soviet-Chinese summit was in Beijing between Nikita S.
Khrushchev and Mao Tse-Tung in 1959 as Mao challenged the Soviets'
leadership of the once-solid Communist bloc. Relations plummeted
shortly afterward, and the Soviets pulled out thousands of
technical advisers who had been helping rebuild China.
   In the years since, China endured the trauma of the Cultural
Revolution, and the Soviets experienced what is now referred to as
the ``era of stagnation'' but which is remembered here as a time of
Soviet adventurism in Asia.
   A series of border clashes along the Soviet-Chinese frontier,
Kremlin backing for the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia and the
Soviet military drive into Afghanistan all exacerbated what began
as ideological differences.
   The Soviets, eager for a role in Asia's development boom, have
trumpeted the summit as a renewal of a once-great friendship and
have spared no opportunity to herald its historic significance.
Taking a lesson from U.S. and other Western politicians, they have
staged a public relations campaign for the attention of the world
media gathered in Beijing.
   The Chinese were more subdued all along, having pressed the
Kremlin to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, pull back its
forces from the Chinese border and get the Vietnamese out of
Cambodia before agreeing to a summit.
   Moscow claims to have met the conditions. The last Soviet troops
left Afghanistan in February, the Kremlin helped broker a
Vietnamese pledge to be out of Cambodia by September, and on
Monday, the Soviets were scheduled to begin withdrawal of some
50,000 troops, along with tanks, artillery and air forces, from
Mongolia.
   Mongolia, a Soviet ally sandwiched between the two giants in the
middle of their 4,300-mile border, is believed to have more than
65,000 Soviet troops posted along its Chinese border.

   Carlos Menem swept to victory in
presidential elections Sunday, capping a resurgence by the Peronist
Party that had been suppressed by the military for most of the past
three decades.
   With results from 56,548 of 75,358 ballot boxes nationwide,
Menem tallied 5,913,943 votes, or 46.8 percent, the Interior
Ministry reported five hours after polls closed.
   In second place, Eduardo Angeloz of the ruling Radical Civic
Union got 4,737,246 votes, or 37.3 percent, it said.
   ``I've defeated an adversary, but I've regained a friend,'' said
Menem, who is governor of La Rioja Province. Menem, 58, and
Angeloz, 57, were law school classmates at the University of
Cordoba in the 1950s.
   Angeloz called Menem to concede defeat and congratulate him.
Angeloz, who is governor of Cordoba Province, told reporters he
``will continue working in my province, and later I'll see what I
can do on the national level.''
   Menem immediately tried to heal wounds from the long, bitter
campaign. He told reporters in La Rioja, ``I'm going to ask him to
work with me, and we'll go together toward a proposal of national
unity.''
   The vote count was to continue until 3 a.m. (2 a.m. EDT).
   It was not a direct election. Instead the voters cast ballots
for 600 presidential electors. Menem needs 301 to avoid a contest
within the Electoral College that will meet Aug. 10.
   The Interior Ministry did not release projections on electors,
but Peronist spokesman Cesar Arias said party calculations indicate
Menem will receive the votes of up to 350 electors.
   Several thousand people gathered late Sunday outside the
Peronists' campaign headquarters in a downtown Buenos Aires hotel.
They sang the party's anthem and chanted, ``The Radical
dictatorship is going to fall.''
   Turnout among the electorate of 20 million was projected at a
record 85 percent. Voting was calm and orderly across this South
American nation of 31 million.
   The two main contenders were trailed by nine other candidates.
   Pre-election polls had indicated the center-left Peronists would
win and Menem would replace President Raul Alfonsin of the centrist
Civic Union when his six-year term ends.
   The principal campaign issue in Argentina, once one of the
world's wealthiest nations, was the economy, which has been
declining since the mid-1940s and took a steep dip in recent months.
   ``Today, we put our prejudices aside. The issues have divided us
for months, but now we put them on the back burner, and we're all
concentrating on one thing: Today we are changing history,'' said
Medine Ruilio, a 53-year-old painter.
   Alfonsin's inauguration in December 1983 ended nearly eight
years of military dictatorships. The constitution bars Alfonsin
from seeking re-election. The new president will be inaugurated
Dec. 10.
   Argentines also are electing a vice president, half the Chamber
of Deputies, one national senator, legislatures in 14 of the
nation's 22 provinces, and several thousand municipal officials.
   Menem and Angeloz offered different visions of how Argentina
might overcome a chronic budget deficit, triple-digit inflation,
rising unemployment and a $59 billion foreign debt.
   In the 1930s, beef and grain exports to Europe placed the
country among the world's 10 wealthiest nations.
   Menem, the candidate of labor unions and the working poor,
pledged to dramatically improve wages and hinted he might not
continue payments on the foreign debt.
   He has spoken vaguely of a ``productive revolution'' and
``social pact'' to spur employment, slash the budget deficit, raise
the value of the national currency and curtail inflation.
   Angeloz, the candidate of the middle class, pledged to sell
inefficient state industries, maintain a free exchange rate, spur
exports and diminish the power of the 4 million-strong General
Labor Confederation union, the cornerstone of the Peronist Party.
   The biggest of the approximately 300 companies controlled by the
government were nationalized by Gen. Juan Domingo Peron when he was
in power between 1946 and 1955, the year he was ousted by a
military coup. Currently, about 2 million Argentines of a work
force of about 11 million are employed by the state.
   Despite some acrimony, campaigns were lackluster in comparison
with 1983, when the mood was jubilant, hopes were higher, crowds
were larger, and the main issue _ democracy _ clear-cut.
   The election marked the first time an elected civilian replaced
another since 1928, when Hipolito Yrigoyen succeeded Marcelo T. de
Alvear. Yrigoyen was overthrown by a military coup in 1930.
   The Peronist Party claims 4 million members and has been the
country's biggest since it was put together by Peron and he was
elected in 1946. Following his overthrow in September 1955, the
party was banned and many of its leaders jailed or exiled until
1973, when Peron returned from Spain and was elected more by an
overwhelming margin.
   Following Peron's death July 1, 1974, his wife, Isabel, took
over as president. She was deposed by a coup in March 1976 and the
military rulers jailed Menem.

<TEXT>
   The Senate this week heads into what could be
a close vote on the $7 billion FSX deal calling for joint
U.S.-Japanese development and production of a next-generation
fighter for Japan.
   Debate over the controversial plan has pitted foes arguing that
it will jeopardize American jobs and technological prowess against
proponents stressing the need to maintain strong U.S. defense
cooperation with Japan.
   Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., asserted that despite recent
assurances from the Japanese on a 40 percent U.S. share in the FSX
project and safeguards for sensitive technology, ``this is still
the same old deal _ a bad, bad, bad, bad deal for America.''
   If the deal goes through, Dixon said, ``we will be helping our
fiercest economic competitor build a top-notch aerospace industry.''
   However, Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., calling for support of
the agreement, cited the ``critical importance'' of U.S.-Japan
defense ties.
   ``It is important that we stay together with Japan, that we
maintain that cooperation and alliance,'' he told the Senate.
   Under the FSX deal, General Dynamics and Japan's Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries would jointly develop and produce the FSX, an
advanced version of the American F-16. General Dynamics has
headquarters in St. Louis, but most of the FSX work would be done
at its F-16 plant in Fort Worth, Texas.
   The Senate's vote on a resolution to halt the FSX is tentatively
scheduled for Tuesday afternoon.
   Andy Semmel, an aide to Lugar, said: ``I think it's going to be
extremely close.'' He pointed to the 9-8 margin by which the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee narrowly voted last Thursday to support
the deal.
   A companion resolution of disapproval has been introduced in the
House, where it is awaiting action by the Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Even if the resolutions were passed, however, a two-thirds
majority of both houses would be needed to override a likely
presidential veto.
   In other congressional action this week, the House and Senate
will follow through on last month's deficit-reduction agreement
with President Bush when they consider the $1.17 trillion budget
for fiscal 1990.
   Negotiators from the two chambers completed work on a final
version of the plan last Thursday, and final passage of the
spending plan is expected to be little more than an exercise in
rubber-stamping.
   The budget, for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, would hold
natural resources, transportation, agriculture and veterans
programs to growth rates below the rate of inflation. It would also
limit defense spending to $299.2 billion, $4.2 billion below what
would be needed to keep up with cost increases.
   At the same time, it would boost beyond inflation federal
efforts for science, education and health programs.
   The spending blueprint claims to reduce the federal deficit to
$99.7 billion _ just within the $100 million limit set in the
Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law.
   By contrast with the budget, Bush and the Democratic-controlled
Congress are anything but in harmony on the issue of raising the
minimum wage.
   Last Thursday, the House passed legislation that would increase
the $3.35 hourly minimum wage to $4.55 by October 1991. The Senate
is poised to pass a similar measure this week, and Bush is already
threatening a veto.
   The White House prefers a version that would limit the increase
to $4.25 by January 1992. Its version also would impose a
subminimum wage for six months, as opposed to the 60-day training
wage favored by congressional Democrats.
   Democrats seem unlikely to be able muster the two-thirds
majorities in both houses that would be needed to override a veto.
But they are pressing the issue anyway in an attempt to position
themselves politically as the friend of the country's wage earners.

   The Congressional Record is the repository for
the weighty debates of the House and Senate whose members wrestle
with issues, and for the musings of members when their fancy turns
to weighty wrestlers.
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., recently inserted into the Record
a confession of passion for wrestling in general, and for one
wrestler in particular.
   In the midst of consternation over Panama and turmoil over
allegations against House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, Dymally
announced his admiration for ``superstar Hulk Hogan, the World
Wrestling Federation champion.''
   Hulk Hogan, the congressman declared, ``has electrified the
world by being the center of an international movement known as
Hulkamania.''
   ``As a devoted fan of his, I join with millions of others who
echo the sentiment that Hulkamania is running wild,'' the
congressman said. ``Hulk is everywhere _ on life-size posters,
T-shirts, action dolls, pot holders, baby bibs, VCR's, computer and
board games, clothing, glassware and records.''
   All of this, Dymally said, generates over $300 million a year in
ticket sales, advertising, licensing and merchandising.
   Dymally ticked off Hogan's recent television appearances and his
Sports Illustrated cover.
   ``I cherish those moments spent watching Hulk in action as a
fine wrestler and a charismatic performer,'' Dymally said. ``Hulk
has offered the bright lights, excitement and entertainment that no
Broadway performance could ever match.''
   Dymally said his interest in wrestling goes back a long way.
   While serving as lieutenant governor of California, he said, ``I
would frequently attend wrestling matches dressed in a suit and
tie, in the midst of boisterous spectators surrounding me in blue
jeans and T-shirts.''
   Who said congressmen were stodgy?''

   It was an unusual confession.
   At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on ways to increase
voter registration, senators said that large states were less
suitable for liberalized procedures than some of the smaller, more
rural states because of vote fraud in large urban centers.
   There was a bit of a debate about it, almost literally on the
theme of my state is more crooked than your state.
   ``I think that historically my state has more vote fraud than
your state,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., to Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky.
   ``I don't see how that's possible,'' McConnell shot back.
   Specter conceded that it is just possible that Pennsylvania may
have had more vote fraud than Kentucky only because it has a longer
history than Kentucky.
   But he added, nodding to Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., that he
believes that Philadelphia and Chicago have probably had more vote
fraud than any other two American cities put together.
   ``And I say that with some deference to Boston,'' he added,
turning to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.

<HEAD>Baker Says It Would Be A ``Mistake'' To Try To Void Canal Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
rejecting calls for the Panama Canal Treaty to be abrogated, while
the man in charge of the American troops sent to Panama says
diplomacy must be used to remove Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from
power.
   ``I think it would be counterproductive,'' Baker said Sunday on
the CBS news program ``Face the Nation,'' when asked whether the
United States should consider voiding the treaty.
   Some members of Congress have called for abrogating the treaty
in view of Noriega's intransigence. The military ruler sought last
week to nullify the results of an election that went against his
handpicked candidates by a 3-to-1 margin.
   Baker said such an action would turn ``this into a United States
vs. Panama _ and in effect versus some of the rest of Latin America
_ contest.''
   During a commencement address at the University of Wyoming,
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said diplomacy must be against
Noriega.
   ``I think whatever you do is going to have to be done
diplomatically,'' Cheney said. ``It would help if the other Latin
American nations would come together and make it clear that they
won't deal with a Panamanian government headed by Mr. Noriega.''
   Cheney also praised Bush for his decision last week to send U.S.
troops to Panama.
   ``I think it was a necessary move, it was a step that a prudent
man would take,'' he said. ``We've got some 40,000 Americans who
live in Panama, we've got major obligations ... under the Panama
Canal Treaty.''
   A day earlier, Bush had used stronger language than either
Cabinet member when he exhorted the Panamanian people to rise up
against Noriega. Though he stopped short of urging violence or a
coup, Bush told reporters: ``The people should do everything they
can to have the will of the people respected. They ought to just do
everything they can to get Mr. Noriega out of there.''
   Under the canal treaty, which was negotiated during the Carter
administration, full control of the strategic waterway is to be
turned over to Panama 10 years from now. Over the next decade,
Panamanian officials are to gradually assume a greater role in
administering the canal.
   The secretary of state said measures taken by the Bush
administration to support the Panamanian political opposition and
encourage Noriega's departure from Panama need ``some time to
work.''
   ``I think it's very important that the will of the Panamanian
people be given effect,'' Baker said. ``We had an election here
that's been stolen. We have the will of the people being subverted
and perverted. So we ought to do everything within reason that we
can to encourage this man (Noriega) to leave _ to bring pressure
... on him to leave.''
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Western
hemisphere subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
said the United States should not completely rule out taking
military action against Noriega's regime if future circumstances
warrant.
   Asked about the possibility of using U.S. forces in Panama, Dodd
said: ``You never say what you're not going to do, and you never
remove that arrow from your quiver. ... If you're talking about

   A commission to coordinate the federal attack
on AIDS has yet to sit down to work, and a Democratic congressman
who helped create it blames President Bush for being five months
late in appointing members.
   The White House defended the delay in appointing two additional
members, saying it is still staffing a new administration, and says
a list of names should be given to the president within the next
two weeks.
   Congress created the bipartisan commission last year to
coordinate the federal attack on AIDS. Although Congress gave the
president and House and Senate leaders 45 days to select the 15
members of the panel, no one met the Dec. 19 deadline.
   House leaders announced their five appointments in February, and
Senate leaders only finished their five selections earlier this
month.
   Bush must still appoint two members to serve along with the
secretary of health and human services, the surgeon general and the
secretary of veterans affairs.
   Rep. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., who sponsored the legislation that
created the commission, said in an interview Friday that Bush's
failure to make his appointments is holding up the work of the
panel of medical, scientific and legal experts.
   ``As long as it's not functioning, we're not addressing the
problem and the number of AIDS cases that we're aware of is going
up exponentially,'' said Rowland, a physician who was one of the
five people selected by House leaders to serve on the commission.
   ``We have no idea how many people have been exposed to the virus
that don't have the disease yet,'' he said. ``There's just all
kinds of things that we need to be dealing with from a policy
standpoint that we're not dealing with.''
   White House spokesman Alixe Glen said the appointments have been
delayed because of ``the enormous task'' of staffing a new
administration.
   ``While this is a priority, it has not moved as quickly as
perhaps it should have,'' she said. ``However, within the next
couple of weeks, names should be forwarded to the president.''
   The new commission was endorsed by the National Academy of
Sciences and the Institute of Medicine in a white paper on AIDS
that was presented to Bush at the beginning of his administration.
   Rowland said the emergency supplemental appropriations bill up
for final action in Congress this week includes $400,000 this year
for the commission. He said an additional $2 million has been set
aside in the fiscal 1990 budget to fund the panel's operations.
   But until Bush makes his appointments, Rowland said, the
commission simply can't function.
   In addition to Rowland, the House appointees are Diane Ahrens,
head of the Ramsey County, Minn., board of commissioners who
established an AIDS task force in St. Paul; Scott Allen, a Baptist
minister and coordinator of the AIDS Interfaith Network in Dallas;
Dr. Don C. Des Jarlais, coordinator of AIDS research for the New
York state division of substance abuse services; and Donald S.
Goldman, a Livingston, N.J., attorney who has written and lectured
on legal and ethical questions relating to AIDS.
   Senate appointees are Larry Kessler, founder of the Boston AIDS
Action Committee; Dr. June Osborn, dean of the school of public
health at the University of Michigan; Harry Dalton, a Yale
University law professor who is a recognized expert in AIDS legal
issues; Dr. Charles Konigsbert, director of the health division of
the Kansas Department of Health and Environment; and Eunice Diaz,
director of community affairs at White Memorial Medical Center in
Los Angeles.

   If you want to be known as the city of
breakfast champions, you have to forget about cholesterol once in a
while.
   Nearly 34,000 residents chowed down thousands of pounds of
pancakes drenched in a ton of butter Saturday to allow Springfield
to reclaim its title of having served the world's biggest breakfast.
   The winning recipe included 3,000 pounds of flour, 600 pounds of
eggs and 400 gallons of water. The 33,869 diners washed down the
meal with 600 gallons of coffee.
   ``We're getting it down to a science,'' said Amy Barron, a
spokeswoman for the event.
   But the city's claim to glory could be fleeting. Residents of
Battle Creek, Mich., next month will try to win back the title when
they convene to share a similar meal.
   The massive feed marked the 14th time Springfield has gone up
against Battle Creek, home of the Kellogg Co. cereal company.
   Battle Creek served a spread for 32,000 people last year.
   ``It's a great way to get people to come downtown and see there
really is a downtown in Springfield,'' said state Rep. Athan
Catjakis, who chaired the annual breakfast with city Councilor
William Foley.

   The 12th annual barbecue contest, with 175 teams from around the

Saturday.
   The cookoff, as usual, was marked by the bizarre and colorful.
   The Pepto Porkers team set their table with china, crystal and
silver and entertained the judges with dulcimer music, while
cooking their entry in a giant Pepto Bismol-styled bottle.
   The Pot Bellied Porkers of Collierville persevered over the more

   Imagine a World Series involving blue jays,
orioles and cardinals. Then throw in sparrows, seagulls and eagles.
   It sounds unlikely, but that is what happened as bird watchers
from around the continent flocked to the Garden State for the World
Series of Bird Watching.
   Thirty-one teams of bird watchers drove across the state trying
to spot as many species of birds as possible during the 24 hours
that ended Saturday night.
   The team from Bausch and Lomb Inc. won by identifying 201 birds
nesting, feeding and flying over the Garden State.
   ``It's done on the honor system,'' said Peter Dunne, a spokesman
for the New Jersey Audubon Society, which sponsored the
sixth-annual World Series. ``If they say they saw a species, we
believe them. Birders wouldn't lie.''
   This year's event attracted teams from as far away as California

   Israeli leaders are under growing pressure to
seek the release of convicted American spy Jonathan J. Pollard, but
are playing down the case for fear of disrupting relations with the
United States.
   Pollard, a 34-year-old American Jew, was sentenced to life in
prison in March 1987 for selling U.S. military secrets to Israel.
His wife, Anne Henderson-Pollard, is serving a five-year term for
helping him.
   Israeli leaders have disclaimed responsibility, saying Pollard
was run by a rogue intelligence operation in Israel's Defense
Ministry.
   Many Israelis feel their government must try to secure Pollard's
release. There are complaints that it betrayed Pollard, who was
turned away when he sought asylum at the Israeli Embassy in
Washington after his exposure.
   ``He is seen by Israelis as having done something significant
for Israel's defense. There is a longstanding tradition in Israel
that you don't abandon people in the field,'' said Harry Wall, head
of the Israel branch of the New York-based Anti-Defamation League.
   Since January, a growing number of Israelis have spoken out for
Pollard.
   A 70-member lobby has formed in Israel's 120-seat Parliament and
passed a resolution urging President Bush to pardon the Pollards. A
petition drive demanding his release has collected 21,000
signatures, and school children were organized to send drawings to
Pollard for Passover.
   ``We as Jews are obligated to do everything in our power to work
for the release of the Pollard couple,'' Interior Minister Arye
Deri said after meeting last month with Pollard's parents and
giving them a Bible and other religious objects for their son.
   Pollard's father, Morris, a biochemist from South Bend, Ind.,
said he saw little sign of action to free his son. But there are
indications that Israeli government officials are taking quiet
steps.
   ``People in the government tell us, `We are dealing with the
matter behind the scenes, but everything has to be terribly
discreet,''' said Micaela Ziv, who heads a group called Israelis
for the Pollards, which sponsored the petition drive.
   News reports say Israel is setting aside $5,000 a month to be
given the Pollards after their release.
   Officially, the government blocks all inquiries. The Defense and
Foreign ministries refuse comment, and Avi Pazner, an aide to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, says: ``I don't think we should discuss
this subject publicly.''
   He said Shamir did not raise the case during his April visit to
Washington.
   A senior government official noted the renewed publicity comes
as Israel is depending on U.S. help to negotiate an interim peace
settlement with Palestinians to ease international criticism over
its handling of the uprising in the occupied territories.
   ``This is not the time to start digging up the past,'' said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Both countries are
facing historic decisions and their dialogue will have enormous
importance for the future of the Middle East.''
   But the Pollard affair, once described by Israel's senior
statesman Abba Eban as ``the most difficult moment in the history
of Israel's international relations,'' lingers.
   U.S. protests last month reportedly forced the resignation of
one of Pollard's handlers, air force Col. Aviem Sella, from a top
position in the Israeli electronics firm El-Op, which is heavily
subsidized by the government. In early May, U.S. officials came to
Israel to discuss several unresolved matters in the case, in which
Pollard, an intelligence analyst for the U.S. Navy, sold thousands
of secrets to Israel.
   Questions remain about how much Israel's three top leaders _
Shamir, Finance Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin _ really knew.
   Wolf Blitzer of the Jerusalem Post newspaper writes in a new
book, ``The Territory of Lies,'' that at least one of the three
leaders ``probably knew'' that intelligence operative Rafael Eytan
ran a spy ring in Washington but was unaware of the details.
   Blitzer wrote that Eytan and other contacts took the risk
because they ``apparently assumed, arrogantly and recklessly, that
they would not get caught.''
   Eytan, a protege of right-wing former Defense Minister Ariel
Sharon, recruited an American spy because he ``belonged to a school
that sees relations with the United States as more adversarial than
most,'' said Shai Feldman, a researcher at Tel Aviv University's
Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.
   Some Israelis apparently also felt Washington was withholding
reports on Soviet weapons systems in Arab countries. The Jerusalem
Post wrote after Pollard's capture in November 1985 that the
information he sold should have been given to Israel.
   The government official who discussed the case said it does not
affect U.S.-Israeli defense and intelligence relations now, but
that ``the scars still exist on the American side.''
   ``Such a scar only hurts when you reopen it, and we hope we
don't have to do that,'' he said.
   A growing number of Israelis feel otherwise.
   In the southern Negev desert, the town of Mitzpe Ramon has
``adopted'' the couple, and set aside an unfurnished house for them.
   ``The Pollards have helped Israel, and now Israel must help
them,'' Mayor Shmuel Cohen said.

<HEAD>Congress Eyeing Aviation Trust Fund In Move To Improve Security</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A $6.9 billion surplus in an aviation trust
fund that is entangled in budget-balancing contrivances would be
released to pay for devices to detect plastic explosives in
airliner luggage, under legislation before a House committee.
   The administration already has ordered airlines to buy and
install $1 million thermal neutron devices in high-risk U.S. and
foreign airports, even though the method of payment is not settled.
   The first thermal neutron device, which detects plastic
explosives by bombarding luggage with neutrons, is to be installed
at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York in July.
   Airlines traditionally have paid for and operated security
screening equipment at airports they use.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says airlines could
recover the added expense by increasing international air fares
about $1 a ticket. But a House committee dealing with aviation
issues wants to break into the bulging Airport and Airway Trust
Fund and pay $270 million for plastic explosives detection and
other airport security.
   The House plan would not affect fares because the money is
already there, the result of previous collections of taxes on
tickets, aviation fuel and air freight. The fund, set up in 1971,
is intended to cover airport buildings, runways and equipment,
although it does end up covering a large chunk of the Federal
Aviation Administration's operating expenses.
   Because of pressure to reduce the deficit, neither the White
House nor Congress has been willing to dip into the aviation
surplus, which will hit $6.9 billion on Sept. 30.
   The Bush administration, like the Reagan administration before
it, says the fund grows because Congress has been unwilling to use
it to cover more of the general expenses of the FAA, which then has
to come from general tax revenue.
   A bill sponsored by Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., says the trust
fund money should be released for security expenses because ``the
airlines are subjected to terrorism directed at policies of the
United States government.''
   Oberstar's bill passed the Public Works Committee with little
opposition after the aviation subcommittee rejected a Republican
attempt to make the airlines pay at least half the cost of the new
security devices. The measure is expected to go to the House floor
next month.
   Concern over plastic explosives swept world governments and the
aviation industry after the Dec. 3 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. Authorities say
the bomb was plastic explosives concealed inside a cassette tape
player.
   Oberstar's bill is the first attempt to give trust fund money
directly to airlines, and opponents say it could set a precedent
that might lead to appeals for funds to replace aging airliners or
correct other airline problems.
   The bill's supporters, however, see it as a first step toward
spending trust fund money as it originally was intended _ on
airports and the air traffic control system.
   The fund now pays for 57 percent of FAA's expenses, with the
rest of the agency's $6.4 billion budget coming from general tax
revenue.
   The Transportation Department says that since 1982, $39.6
billion in federal funds have gone to aviation, with $22.6 billion
coming from the trust fund, or from aviation users, and $17 billion
from general revenue, or from all taxpayers.
   Legislative tinkering has allowed the surplus to grow even
though more federal money is spent on aviation each year.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commmission should
set performance standards for both adult- and child-size bicycle
helmets, a private safety group says.
   The group, the National Safe Kids Campaign, says that federal
standards would help reduce the 1,000 deaths and half-million
serious injuries each year in bicycle accidents.
   Members of the campaign said they were going to present a
petition the CPSC today to require those standards.
   ``If we are to prevent thousands of kids from being injured and
killed each year while bicycling, we must remove the barriers to
helmet use,'' Herta Feely, campaign executive director, said in a
statement.
   The campaign, supported by the Consumer Federation of America
and 34 other organizations, recommends that all children and adults
wear helmets when riding any bike.
   People often don't use helmets because they feel they are not
needed, doubt their effectiveness or are confused over which ones
to buy, Feely said.
   Until national standards are adopted, bike riders should use
helmets that have safety approval labels from the American National
Standards Institute or the Snell Memorial Foundation, said campaign
officials.
   The ANSI and Snell standards test the ability of a helmet to
absorb the impact of a collision. Conformity with either standard
is voluntary, and not all helmet manufacturers submit their
products for testing.
   Bike-related injuries and deaths have increased 27 percent over
the last decade, Feely said.
   Martin R. Eichelberger, campaign chairman, noted that the safety
commission has taken several steps to protect children from
injuries and deaths from other products.
   ``Surely, the federal government does not believe that brain
trauma and permanent disability are an acceptable reality for
America's children,'' he said.
   ``With this petition for a helmet standard, we hope to
demonstrate to the U.S. Congress and the Bush administration the
urgent need to reinstate the commission to its former level of
effectiveness,'' Eichelberger said.
   He said the campaign also has been working with helmet
manufacturers to keep the price of helmets down and has reached
agreements with Bell Helmets and Kiwi and Pro-tec helmet
distributors to make their products cheaper and more widely
available.

   Cleanup crews scoured hardened crude
oil from beaches as federal investigators prepared to open an
inquiry into the cause of the nation's worst oil spill.
   Coast Guard planes, meanwhile, crisscrossed the spill site in
Prince William Sound to chart oil-free routes for fishing boats
setting out for the halibut season today.
   ``Oil sightings will be relayed to fishermen by radio,'' Coast
Guard spokesman Dennis Hubbard said. ``Whatever we've got, we're
using. C-130s, helicopters, whatever.''
   Today's commerical halibut fishing is the first of several
24-hour periods that constitute the halibut season. The annual
halibut harvest in and around Prince William Sound has been
estimated at $85 million.
   Officials already have canceled the herring season since the
tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in the sound on March 24 and
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude.
   The oil fouled island beaches and coastal shores in the sound,
then moved nearly 450 miles southwest of Valdez to Wide Bay, across
from the southern end of Kodiak Island.
   Government and Exxon officials plan a three-day test of a
chemical dispersant designed to break down the beached crude and
make it easier to retrieve. The tests are to begin Wednesday.
   The chemical, similar to a strong liquid soap, will be applied
to the beaches of Ingot Island in Prince William Sound, allowed to
soak, then washed off after several hours with warm water sprayed
from high-pressure hoses.
   Coast Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins said the chemical was less
powerful than other types of dispersant. The Coast Guard hopes the
chemical will loosen oil from the shore and move it back into the
water where it can be scooped up, he said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has scheduled five days
of hearings beginning Tuesday to investigate the cause of the
spill. More than two dozen witnesses are expected, including Coast
Guard personnel, crew members from the tanker Exxon Valdez and
Exxon executives.
   The board expects to issue a report on the accident by early
next year, spokeswoman Drucella Andersen said. ``We hope to
determine the probable cause and make some safety
recommendations,'' she said.
   A panel of inquiry will consist of one board member to conduct
the proceedings, staff members and investigators to sift the
evidence and representatives of each of the four parties having a
direct interest in the proceedings.
   Those are the state of Alaska, Exxon, the Coast Guard and
Alyeska, the operator of the 800-mile-long trans-Alaska pipeline.
   The panel chairman is Lee Dickenson, the only transportation
board member who will be in Anchorage. Later, in Washington, D.C.,
the full board will consider the evidence.
   Unlike a court of law, NTSB rules specifically bar lawyers from
posing questions. Instead, representatives of each of the four
parties question the witnesses directly, as does Dickenson.
   One person who won't be at the hearings is the skipper of the
Exxon Valdez, Joseph Hazelwood.
   He declined to testify but offered information in writing.
Hazelwood has been charged with three misdemeanor counts that
include operating a vessel while drunk. His trial is scheduled to
begin June 20 in Valdez.
   Hazelwood, who is free on $50,000 bail, faces 27 months in
prison and $11,000 in fines if convicted of the charges. He also is
the subject of an Alaska grand jury investigation into the spill.

   The dollar closed sharply higher against the
Japanese yen Monday, while stock prices lost ground on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 136.80, up 1.00 yen from last Friday's
close of 135.80 yen. The U.S. currency opened at 136.57 yen and
moved in a range of 136.50-136.95 yen.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rise to confusion in
the Japanese political scene coming from the ruling party's
inability to find the new prime minister to succeed Noboru
Takeshita, who is expected to resign shortly.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party failed to persuade a
senior lawmaker to accept the party's appointment for the
premiership last week, and it has not been able to find an
alternative candidate.
   ``Until the political situation at home settles down, the yen is
likely to continue to lose ground,'' said Masato Sanjo, a dealer
for Hannover Trust in Tokyo.
   ``Interventions by the Bank of Japan have been reported today
(Monday), but they have not been effective enough to stop the
dollar's rise,'' a dealer at a major Japanese bank said.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said the bank made the
$400 million intervention at 136.55 yen and 136.75 yen. It was the
first time the dollar surpassed the 136.00-yen mark since Sept. 6.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
215.16 points Friday, shed another 150.04 points, or 0.44 percent,
to close at 33,716.29.
   Securities dealers also attributed the stock plunge to the
volatile political situation and the yen's weakness against the
dollar.
   ``Until the fluctuation of exchange rates settles down, stock
price are unlikely to regain upward momentum,'' said a dealer for a
major Japanese brokerage, requesting anonymity.

   Members of the Andy Griffith Show
Appreciation Society were quick to spot the differences between
Mount Airy and the fictional town of Mayberry.
   The name of Aunt Bea's barbecue restaurant is wrong. The
real-life eatery is named Aunt Bee, and the difference matters to a
person who's watched and videotaped all 249 episodes of ``The Andy
Griffith Show.''
   ``I noticed that the first thing when I drove into town,'' said
Linda Stewart of Dallas.
   Stewart drove in Saturday for the society's annual convention,
held in Winston-Salem this weekend. About 350 members took buses 35
miles up the road to Mount Airy, Griffith's hometown and
inspiration for some of the names and landmarks of his 1960-68
television show.
   Floyd's Barbershop is really named the City Barbershop, but the
man there has cut Griffith's hair a few times. The Snappy Grill,
next door on Main Street, really is the Snappy Grill.
   ``I can die happy now. I can give up the ghost,'' said Ms.
Stewart, 47. ``Mostly I can relate to the lifestyle, because we sit
on the porch at home and rock, go to church, even eat the same kind
of foods. I can't relate to shows today because we don't have
cocktails every five minutes.''

   Will they or won't they?
   The big question when the tightly orchestrated Soviet-Chinese
summit between Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping begins is
whether the leaders will embrace to symbolically end 30 years of
strained relations.
   Deng, the 84-year-old paramount leader of China, hugs some
foreign dignitaries and shakes hands with others. His choice of
welcome is seen as a sign of his personal feeling toward the guest
or their nation.
   When Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze visited Deng in
Shanghai last February he received a warm and lengthy handshake,
but no hug. Schevardnadze referred to the Chinese leader as
``comrade,'' but the socialist honorific was not returned.
   ``Of course there are some reporters who pay attention to this
question,'' said a bemused Xing Shugang, a Sovietologist at the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ``They think it sets a
standard.''
   Xing said he places little importance on the high-level
greeting. But for the record, he expects no embraces when the two
leaders meet Tuesday.
   A Ministry of Foreign Affairs also weighed in with his opinion
on the first encounter between Deng and Gorbachev. The Soviet
leader will probably call Deng ``comrade,'' he said, but ``I do not
think Deng will call him comrade in return.''
   Before the final communique is issued at the end of the four-day
summit, every action by Gorbachev and his Chinese hosts will be
dissected for hidden insight into the progress of the talks.
   When the Soviet leader arrived in Beijing today, President Yang
Shangkun greeted him on the tarmac with a warm two-handed handshake.
   But one Western diplomat warned not to read too much into an
embrace, or the lack thereof.
   ``It's a bit misleading to say that Deng bear-hugged Gorbachev
so every thing is alright, or to say Deng didn't bearhug Gorbachev
so the summit is a flop,'' he said.

<HEAD>Translating Joyce's `Ulysses' An Odyssey For Chinese Scholar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jin Di has been on an odyssey of his own
since fellow scholars in China asked him 10 years ago to do the
seemingly impossible: translate James Joyce's ``Ulysses'' into
Chinese.
   With few Joyce scholars or books in his country to guide him,
Jin has used his wanderings outside China and correspondence with
an expert at Yale to learn enough about the novel to begin to
translate it into his native tongue.
   After a year as a senior research fellow at the University of
Notre Dame, the 67-year-old teacher of translation theory can now
be found hunched over material from the James Joyce collection at
Yale's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.
   He has been studying various translations to see how others in
his field dealt with the almost scientific precision Joyce used in
telling the story of advertisement-canvassser Leopold Bloom.
   Jin's translation of about a fifth of the work into Chinese was
published three years ago, and a publishing house in Beijing has
agreed to publish his translation of selected portions from a
little more than half of ``Ulysses'' in 1990.
   Jin aspires to translate the entire book, but said ``much
depends on what I can do here.''
   ``There are no Joyceans in China, so if there are any questions,
I have nobody to discuss them with,'' Jin said one recent morning.
   He will spend a semester at the University of Virginia after his
two-month fellowship ends here at the end of May, and then return
to the Foreign Languages Institute in Tianjin, where he has been a
professor since 1977.
   It was in 1979 that people at the Tianjin Academy of Social
Sciences asked him to attempt the translation.
   ``They thought it was outrageous this book which was so famous
in the West was not at all known in China,'' he said.
   ``Nobody had dared approach it _ both the translation and the
reading. Linguistically, it was almost impossible, and the
sociopolitical atmosphere had almost killed the possibility of it
being translated into Chinese,'' he said.
   Jin said he hesitated when he received the request.
   ``I didn't even know what Western scholars had been doing since
the Second World War. It was all a blank to us. China had been
closed to the West for 30 years,'' he said.
   He had read the work only once before _ in 1945 _ when someone
he knew lent him a copy for a week.
   ``I ended with some admiration of the great art of which I had
some glimpses, but I did not really understand what was in it,'' he
said.
   Jin started with one of the easier sections to translate, the
second episode, in which Stephen Dedalus, the hero of Joyce's first
full-length novel, ``A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,'' can
be found teaching a class in Roman history.
   Jin said he was at the point of abandoning the project when he
met Mary T. Reynolds, a Joyce scholar whose husband, a Yale
economics professor, was lecturing at a Chinese university. With
her advice, encouragement and books, Jin continued his project with
renewed vigor.
   ``Ulysses,'' which Joyce wrote from 1914 through 1921 after
having left his native Dublin, has been translated in its entirety
into Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Japanese,
Latvian, Spanish and Swedish. Portions have been translated into
Greek, Italian and Russian.
   Jin hopes to give his compatriots the same opportunity to enjoy
``Ulysses,'' which is the record of a single day, June 16, 1904, in
and around Dublin.
   ``It's really a pity that a fifth of the world cannot read this
masterpiece.''

   The mother of a 3-year-old boy mauled by her pet
wolf said she thought the animal was docile.
   ``I think it was an accident. The dog freaked out and the baby
got caught,'' said Susan Bajinski.
   Timothy Bajinski remained in critical but stable condition
Sunday in the pediatric intensive care unit at Staten Island
Hospital after doctors reattached most of his scalp and ears.
   An examination of the wolf's remains indicated that the animal
did not carry rabies, the Health Department said Sunday.
   The boy was attacked Saturday afternoon while alone in his
mother's backyard, said police spokesman Sgt. Pete Berry. Police
did not know what caused the animal to attack.
   Bill Mann, a friend of the child's mother, beat the animal to
death with a bat when he heard the boy screaming and saw the animal
``standing over the kid like he was guarding him.''
   Bajinski, a bartender, said she got the part-wolf, part-husky
from a friend three weeks ago because her friend's neighbors
complained about its howling.
   The boy's mother was issued a summons for violating health code
regulations by keeping a wild animal within city limits.
   Sgt. Diane Kubler, a police spokeswoman, said the Bureau of
Child Welfare was investigating.

<HEAD>Actress Relishes Purchase of Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASELTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Kim Basinger says her recent
purchase of this small Georgia town for $20 million makes her feel
like ``Barbara Stanwyck in the Big Valley.''
   ``I'm Big Daddy now. I mean, I'm Big Mama. I just bought me a
town,'' she said in an interview in June's Vanity Fair magazine.
   Ms. Basinger, 35, bought Braselton, population 500, in March
with a group of investors. The town had been owned by the Braselton
family for 113 years and is near Ms. Basinger's hometown of Athens.
   For her money, she got the town's water and sewer system, an
industrial park, a shopping center, a few small businesses and
about 50 homes.
   The interview did not directly address rumors that she will use
the town as the site of a movie production company or turn it into
a tourist center.
   But Ms. Basinger did point out that ``the town is 25 minutes
from an airport. It's 53 miles from Atlanta.''
   Half-joking, she added: ``See, I want it to be like Dollywood.
What do you think of the name Kimwood?''
   Ms. Basinger's purchase has generated an incredible response
from investors and developers and boosted property values, said
Gary Guyer, the actress' brother-in-law and investment adviser.
   ``It was strictly a business decision _ 100 percent business,''
said Guyer. ``We had no idea there would be that much publicity
worldwide.''
   ``You wouldn't believe the interest from developers from all
over the world,'' Guyer said. ``I can't see them all. ... That land
is already worth $30 million, maybe $40 million.''
   The Braselton family told reporters at the time of the sale they
had had other offers in the five years the town had been up for
sale but decided to go with Ms. Basinger because the payment would
be in cash. Other bidders had wanted 40 years to pay the deal off _
not an attractive offer for family members in their 70s.
   Ms. Basinger, who has appeared in ``The Natural'' and ``9{
Weeks,'' described the deal differently in Vanity Fair.
   ``To the younger Braseltons, I just put it straight. I said,
`These are the acres where we parked all summer long, every summer.
And I'm here to preserve these fields.' But with the older
Braseltons, I said, `These are the lawns where I'd walk with my
boyfriends.' And they said back to me, `Yes indeed _ a lovely place
to court.' ...
   ``I'm Barbara Stanwyck in the Big Valley. Me and my 1,800
acres.''

   The bodies of six
sailors have been returned to their families, who were told the
deaths in a ship fire were a ``jolting reminder'' of the dangers
faced by the armed forces.
   ``We want you to know that we share your deep pride and your
equally deep sorrow in these fateful days,'' Navy Vice Admiral
Robert K.U. Kihune told relatives of the USS White Plains crew
members at a memorial service Sunday.
   Six sailors were killed, and five others were injured Tuesday,
when a fire broke out in the engine room of the supply ship in the
South China Sea. The fire on the Guam-based ship, part of the
battle group assigned to the aircraft carrier Constellation,
remains under investigation.
   The blaze on the White Plains was the second of three fatal Navy
ship fires during the past 3{ weeks.
   An honor guard met the six flag-draped coffins, flown here by a
C-141 Air Force cargo plane from Clark Air Base in the Philippines.
Pallbearers carried the caskets single-file into a hangar at the
Navy base on the east side of San Francisco Bay where the half-hour
service was held.
   About two dozen family members, some weeping and hugging each
other, and nearly 150 other people attended the service.
   The men honored were: Petty Officer 3rd Class Muoi Cao of
Ventura; Fireman Apprentice Darryl D. Edwards of Flossmoor, Ill.;
Fireman Apprentice Todd A. Follis of Lake Nebagamon, Wis.; Fireman
Baxter Lesarlley of Santa Fe., N.M.; Fireman Apprentice Paul D.
Novotny of Howells, Neb.; and Petty Officer Second Class Jon D.
Ruhmel of Elmira, N.Y.
   ``The sacrifices made by these men is another jolting reminder
of the danger faced by those who fly, (those) at sea, and those who
give freely of themselves to protect our freedom, our heritage and
our responsibility to bring justice and peace among all people of
the world,'' said Kihune, commander of the Naval Surface Force
Pacific.
   On April 19, 47 sailors were killed in an explosion and fire in
a gun turret aboard the Norfolk, Va.-based battleship USS Iowa off
Puerto Rico. On Saturday, an explosion and fire off the coast of
North Carolina killed two crewmen on the Norfolk-based aircraft
carrier USS America.

<HEAD>Baltic Nationalist Leaders Call for Economic Independence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nationalist leaders in the Baltic
republics are calling on Moscow to grant them economic independence
and prosecute officials who had thousands of their countrymen
killed or deported in the 1940s.
   Sixty-one of the three republics' 89 deputies in the new
Congress of People's Deputies also asserted, in a platform to be
presented when the body convenes in Moscow in 10 days, that the
country's 15 republics have the right to set their own policies.
   The first assembly of grassroots People's Fronts from the Soviet
republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania stopped short of
demanding overt independence for their once-sovereign homelands.
   However, the more than 400 activists who gathered in this
Estonian capital Sunday called on Moscow not to ``obstruct the
restoration of state sovereignty'' in their homelands, a wording
some said was a legal prelude to independence.
   For the first time, the Baltic fronts also appealed to the
United Nations and foreign governments to ``heed the aspirations of
our nations to self-determination and independence'' and said their
republics' status should be resolved at the international level,
not in Moscow alone.
   Latvian People's Front leader Dinis Ivans called the weekend
gathering ``the two most important days in the history of the
Baltic movement.''
   Vytautas Landsbergis, chairman of Lithuania's Sajudis mass
movement, said the assembly was ``a golden seed, a seed which will
feed our souls.''
   He said Baltic deputies ``have agreed in principle to take the
common position as a pledge,'' setting the stage for creation of
the first independent voting bloc among deputies.
   They also will seek a ``mechanism to prevent unjust votes'' by
the congress harming Baltic interests, Landsbergis told a news
conference. That apparently means they will seeking veto power over
legislation affecting their homelands.
   ``The fate of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia cannot be decided by
a majority of deputies who have nothing to do with out countries,''
he said.
   On the final day of a two-day session, the ``Baltic Assembly''
said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for perestroika, or
reconstruction, had failed to halt economic decline.
   It asserted the right to ``choose the model of socio-economic
development'' Balts feel is necessary, apparently including
capitalism.
   The assembly rejected an economic plan advanced by Moscow-based
officials that would cede control over food and consumer products
to the 15 Soviet republics but maintain control over energy and
more than half of heavy industry.
   Instead, in a declaration of economic independence, it called
for Baltic residents to be given complete control over their
economies by early next year.
   Legislators in Lithuania and Estonia are to consider economic
reform later this week. An Estonian draft law gives the Tallinn
government control over virtually all industries but defense.
   In Lithuania, activists said reforms declare all resources
``property of the republic,'' and proclaim the right to issue a
local currency.
   Much of the debate over the weekend concerned the forcible
absorption of the Baltic states by Josef Stalin in 1940 following a
secret deal with Nazi Germany.
   The assembly called on the Soviet government to renounce the
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and label Stalin's policy in the Baltics
genocide.
   By admitting it made a deal with Adolf Hitler, the Kremlin would
acknowledge that almost a half-century of rhetoric about the Baltic
states' voluntary inclusion in the Soviet Union was a lie.
   The People's Fronts called on Moscow to publish a list of
officials responsible for political killings and deportations after
the 1940 Soviet takeover, and to create a court similar to the
Nuremburg tribunal that tried Nazi war criminals after World War II.
   The resolution claims hundreds of thousands of Baltic residents
were killed or deported after the Soviet takeover.
   In four resolutions including an appeal to all Congress
deputies, the 61 new Baltic lawmakers called for ``radical
perestroika'' and asserted each republic's right to
self-determination.
   The new lawmakers branded unconstitiutional a government decree
that provides prison terms or fines for criticizing government
officials.
   They demanded the abolition of a special gray-bereted police
force created to put down demonstrations and called for a ban
against the use of chemical agents against civilians, as was done
during the army's suppression of an April protest in Soviet Georgia.
   Twenty people were killed in the Georgian unrest.
   Some delegates said a hardline faction of Lithuanians sought a
declaration of the Baltic states' right to secede from the Soviet
Union but that Estonians and Latvians opposed it because it would
menace Gorbachev's political standing.

<TEXT>
   U.S. immigration officials stood and prayed for
Ferdinand Marcos to be allowed to return to the Philippines, a
videotape shows.
   Harold Ezell, western regional commissioner of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, asked the officials from
several western states to join him in the prayer during an Aug. 3
party at Marcos' mansion overlooking Honolulu, The Honolulu
Advertiser reported Sunday.
   The videotape of the three-hour party also shows Ezell embracing
Marcos and dancing with Marcos' wife, Imelda, while Ezell's wife
danced with the ousted Philippine president, said the newspaper,
which did not reveal the source of the videotape.
   ``Eat your heart out,'' Ezell called out as he danced with Mrs.
Marcos to the beat of ``Don't Throw My Love Away.''
   Official U.S. policy since Marcos fled to exile here in 1986 has
been to have Philippine President Corazon Aquino decide if Marcos
will be allowed to return. Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly refused
Marcos' requests to return home, citing national security.
   Ezell's subordinate, District Immigration Director William
Craig, said the party has turned out to be a ``magnificent
blunder'' for the agency, which he soon regretted and which caused
him to consider resigning.
   But an internal INS investigation concluded there was no
wrongdoing and resulted in no disciplinary action, Craig said.
   ``We all agreed that that was possibly lousy judgment and if we
had to do it again, no,'' Craig told the newspaper.
   The Marcoses and about 70 others in their entourage here are
under Craig's jurisidiction, according to an agreement worked out
by the Reagan administration to bring Marcos to the United States.
   In October, the couple was indicted on racketeering charges that
they looted more than $100 million from the Philippines to buy art
and real estate in New York.
   Marcos, 71, has since been hospitalized in Honolulu for heart
and respiratory ailments, and prosecutors have conceded he is too
ill to stand trial. They are proceeding with criminal charges
against Mrs. Marcos, 59.
   During the party, the INS officials were given plaques of
appreciation for their work for the ``upliftment'' of Philippines
people, and were given autographed copies of their photographs with
the Marcoses, the Advertiser said.
   Craig said he has tried to be evenhanded with the Marcoses and
their entourage, and said there was no connection between the
questions raised about the party and his decision to review the
immigration status of several Marcos associates.
   INS officials in Washington have repeatedly declined to answer
questions about the matter, the Advertiser said.

   The dollar climbed to an 18-month high against the
yen today amid political confusion in Japan, while stock prices
declined on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 136.80, up 1.00 yen from Friday's close of
135.80 yen. It was the highest close since the 136.85 yen on Nov.
16, 1987. The dollar now has climbed 2.36 yen in the past three
trading days.
   After opening at 136.57 yen, the dollar continued upward despite
repeated dollar selling by Japan's central bank, traders said. It
peaked at 136.95 yen in late morning.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rise to confusion over
the governing party's inability to find a successor to Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, who has announced he will resign to take
responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal.
   Last week, the Liberal Democratic Party failed to persuade
senior lawmaker Masayoshi Ito to head the government, and so far
has not been able to find an alternative candidate.
   ``I would not be surprised if the dollar continued to surge
until it hits the 140-yen mark,'' said Masato Sanjo, a dealer for
Manufacturers Hanover Trust in Tokyo.
   ``Until the political situation at home settles down, the yen is
likely to continue to lose ground,'' he said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues lost 150.04 points, or 0.44 percent, closing at
33,716.29. It lost 215.16 points on Friday.
   ``The uncertainity about prospects for the political situation
and unstable yen-dollar rates apparently sidelined many investors
today,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese brokerage, speaking on
condition that he not be further identified.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where most
major shares are listed, was 250 million shares, considerably lower
than average.
   ``Until the fluctuation of exchange rates settles down, stock
prices are unlikely to regain upward momentum,'' said another
dealer for a major Japanese brokerage, also requesting anonymity.

   Chander Singh Nimgule remembers coughing
on the choking smell of red pepper the night of Dec. 2, 1984. He
also remembers his horror as a deadly gas released from a Union
Carbide plant at Bhopal spread.
   ``When we got up to look, there were many dead bodies around
us,'' the 49-year-old Nimgule said of the leak that killed more
than 3,300 people.
   ``I was beginning to lose my consciousness. I gave the money I
was carrying to my wife and went to a corner so they wouldn't see
my dying.''
   Nimgule survived the methyl isocyanate leak but suffers from
labored breathing and a persistent cough. His two younger children
suffer from tuberculosis.
   Nimgule, two other victims, a doctor and a translator were in
West Virginia's Chemical Valley this weekend as part of a
three-month tour of the United States to protest the Indian
government's settlement of lawsuits with Union Carbide for $470
million. The Indian government originally asked for $3 billion.
   Each wore bright red buttons reading ``Bhopal settlement
stinks'' while speaking Saturday at West Virginia State College.
Nearby was a sprawling plant where Union Carbide once had an
operation similar to the one in Bhopal, India.
   ``The people of Bhopal have rejected this settlement,'' said
Satinath Sarangi, a freelance journalist who is the tour translator
and coordinator.
   Union Carbide has claimed a saboteur put water into a methyl
isocyanate tank, triggering a chemical reaction that spewed poison
gas into the night air over Bhopal. Carbide critics say the plant
had numerous safety systems that were either broken down or poorly
designed.
   Death estimates have reached as high as 10,000 and Indian
doctors say 30 to 50 people die monthly because of the methyl
isocyanate exposure. More than 200,000 people were injured.
   The chemical company operated a sister plant to the one at
Bhopal at Institute, shutting down the agricultural unit for five
months after the Indian accident so it could check on plant safety
systems and install new ones.
   Union Carbide sold the unit to Rhone-Poulenc in December 1986
when it left the agricultural products business. It still operates
other units in Institute and at other sites in the Kanawha Valley,
where a string of more than two dozen chemical plants stand along a
15-mile stretch of the river.
   ``Union Carbide's gases have left us like the living dead,''
said Bilkis Bano, appearing far older than her 33 years. She said
she vomited blood for two years.

   A year ago, three ambulance drivers took
injured children to hospitals after the deadliest
drunken-driving-related traffic accident in U.S. history.
   On Mother's Day, Lannis Garnett, his wife, Gladys, and Mayme
Walters were among guests at services marking the first anniversary
of the crash that killed 24 children and three adults aboard a
church bus and left many of the 40 survivors with severe burns.
   ``You relive it quite often,'' said Garnett, who with his wife
operates Owen County Life Squad at Owenton. ``If anything, it gets
more clear as time goes on.''
   The bus burst into flames after colliding with a pickup that
police said was being driven on the wrong side of Interstate 71 by
a drunken driver.
   The crash occurred near Carrollton, about 100 miles northeast of
Radcliff, the post town outside Fort Knox. The driver of the
pickup, Larry W. Mahoney, faces trial in November on 27 counts of
murder and one count of drunken-driving.
   At a community memorial service that capped a day of
remembrance, a minister said that, ``in some ways, today is worse
than others'' for the injured and families of the dead.
   ``It's the first anniversary, combined with Mother's Day, of all
things,'' said Rev. David A. Seamands, a professor at Asbury
Theological Seminary in Wilmore.
   ``That first anniversary is the toughest,'' he said. ``Just when
you think you're getting a handle on it, you get ambushed ... and
that hole in your heart is as big as a canyon.''
   The memorial service was the last of three ceremonies Sunday,
the first drawing several hundred people and the last two more than
1,000 apiece.
   The first was the unveiling of a black granite monument at the
cemetery where many of the victims were buried. Engraved on the
monument are names of those who were aboard the bus.
   The monument was unveiled by six children, including four crash
survivors: Aaron Conyers, 16, Harold Dennis, 15, Carey Aurentz, 15,
and Katrina Muller, 14. Two others were children of crash victims _
John R. Pearman Jr., whose father drove the bus, and Charles J.
Kytta III, whose father was youth minister at the church that owned
the bus, Radcliff First Assembly of God.
   Then came a ceremony in which members of a surviving-family
support group thanked individuals and organizations that helped
them in the past year.
   The names of the victims were read and family members placed a
yellow rose for each on one of 27 wreaths of yellow carnations.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and his wife, Martha, then placed roses
on a larger wreath of yellow roses and white carnations.
   Earlier, the pastor of the Radcliff church, Rev. W. Don
Tennison, said a prayer for laws that would ``make it too costly to
get into an automobile ... drunk.''
   President Bush sent a telegram that called drunken driving a
national tragedy and said laws against it must be strictly enforced.
   ``While reserving judgment against any individual until the
judicial process has run its course, we must guard against
complacency about the overall problem,'' the telegram said.
   For the Garnetts, and Ms. Walters, of Gallatin County Life Squad
in Warsaw, it was a return visit. They attended a candlelight vigil
here in December and said they had kept in contact with the
children they transported last May 14.
   Highway accidents are common in their business, but the enormity

   A woman who spent much of Mother's Day trapped
alone in an elevator said she knew help was on the way when she
heard her 15-year-old son's voice.
   ``I'm laying down in the elevator, crying and crying, and I hear
this little voice saying, `Mommy, mommy, mommy.' When you hear a
kid's voice, `Mommy,' on Mother's Day, you thank God,'' Debby Metz
said from her hospital bed.
   Ms. Metz, 39, was rescued Sunday from the elevator where she had
been trapped for 21 hours after going out Saturday with her twin
sister, Gerry, who always treats her to a pre-Mother's Day dinner.
   At the restaurant, Ms. Metz developed a headache and stepped out
to get an aspirin from her office a block away.
   When the elevator door in the office building closed, the light
shut off and the lift failed to move.
   Ms. Metz said she bloodied her knuckles pushing the emergency
bell and broke her watchband banging on the door.
   ``I'm going up in the elevator to get an aspirin because I have
a headache and then I have to listen to this alarm for 20 hours,''
she said.
   She cried, exercised, prayed, tried to contact her sister with
ESP and finally ``used up about 50 business cards writing out my
will'' because she had no paper.
   ``Then I started to go back to crying,'' she said.
   Meantime, her sister waited in the restaurant for two hours,
thinking she'd gotten busy with business calls, and then strolled
by the building. The door was locked, so she went home and called
her nephew. The boy hadn't seen his mother either, and at about
midnight they started calling hospitals and walking the streets
looking for her, Ms. Metz said.
   ``My sister and my son finally went through my entire apartment
and found an extra set of keys to my office building and my son had
a vibe that I was locked in the elevators,'' she said. ``They
finally got over there around 3 o'clock this afternoon.''
   They called police and paramedics, who rescued her and took her
to St. Clare's Hospital in good condition, but suffering from
dehydration, said Sgt. Edward Burns, a police spokesman.
   Ms. Metz said police were unable to figure out why the elevator
got stuck.

<HEAD>`Eastern Family' Stands Divided</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Outmanned and without reinforcements, a father
struggles valiantly for an unpopular cause. On the opposite side in
the conflict are his son and nephew.
   His brother, physically unable to carry on, has retired from the
fight.
   No, it's not the latest installment of the Civil War story
``North and South.''
   It's part of the continuing saga of Eastern Airlines, where
father and son, and in some cases husband and wife, are divided
while the carrier's fate is played out in courthouses and
boardrooms.
   ``You've heard so much about `the Eastern family.' And
literally, that's true in many cases,'' said company spokesman
Robin Matell.
   Matell said the company keeps no statistics on the numbers of
relatives among the nearly 30,000 employees it had before more than
17,000 union members walked out March 4.
   But Eastern's policy of hiring relatives has been a tradition,
unlike other corporations, which bar close relatives from working
together. That difference may be contributing to the relatively
calm atmosphere of the strike.
   The unions claim Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo's only
goals since buying Eastern three years ago have been to bust unions
and strip assets from the 6-decade-old airline. Lorenzo sought
bankruptcy protection five days into the strike.
   It's a highly personalized strike in which livelihoods and
futures are at stake, but there has been virtually no violence, and
more taunting than animosity between strikers and picket
line-crossers.
   ``I figure everybody chose where they want to be and everybody's
got to do what they've got to do,'' said Steve Hrytzay III, a
striking Machinist Union stock clerk with nine years' experience.
   He's a third-generation Eastern employee and joins his first
cousin, J.R., on the picket line.
   J.R.'s father, Roy Hrytzay, heads Eastern's print shop. His
workforce is down to one-third its prestrike size and, as in most
company offices, nonunion employees have been shifted into new jobs
for which they have little training.
   Yet his shop has been busier than ever, cranking out training
manuals for new pilots and flight attendant recruits and other
materials, including a daily briefing sheet.
   ``You won't meet a harder worker,'' said Eastern spokesman James
Ashlock. Roy Hrytzay declined to be interviewed. He is 53, a
Machinists chief steward before promoted into management.
   His brother Steve Jr., 55, retired March 1, saying high blood
pressure and his age made retirement on the strike's eve pragmatic.
He had been secretary-treasurer of Machinists District 100.
   The strike hasn't caused any family friction, Steve Hrytzay
said, just concern.
   ``My brother and I have always been close,'' he said. ``I worry
about him now because I know they're working them long hours.''
   Eastern pilot Ron Cole said the many Eastern intermarriages are
an asset in the airline business.
   ``You are in a profession where you are away from home a lot,''
Cole said. ``Schedules get changed at the last minute, you usually
have to work holidays. There is a lot of pressure on family life
and it provides a better understanding of the problems if you both
work for the airline.''
   Cole, a union activist, also said the family nature of Eastern's
workforce has contributed to the surprising solidarity of its
employees. Cole and his wife, an Eastern flight attendant, had
Eastern pilot fathers; her mother also an Eastern flight attendant.
   ``There are some deeply held convictions about Eastern and
what's right and wrong,'' said Cole, whose wife last month gave
birth to their second son. ``Both my wife and I hope our sons will
be able to follow in our and our parents' foosteps at Eastern.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms wracked parts of Texas and Oklahoma,
spawning one tornado, generating winds up to 67 mph and dropping
hail as big as baseballs.
   The thunderstorms were most severe along a stationary front over
central Texas Sunday evening. A tornado hit at Brady, baseball-size
hail peppered Eden, and winds gusting to 67 mph drove dime-size
hail at San Angelo.
   There were no reports of injuries or damage.
   Thunderstorms also produced golf ball-size hail east of
Petersburg and in southwestern Floyd County.
   An upper level disturbance generated more storms over northwest
portions of Texas and Oklahoma. Hail the size of baseballs struck
near Boise City, Okla., and Gruver, Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from Tennessee to
Pennsylvania early this morning, over the Carolinas, and over
northern California.
   Heavy rain also hit central Florida late Sunday and early today,
with Orlando receiving 1.38 inches in the six hours ending at 2
a.m. EDT.
   Fog was developing in the upper Ohio Valley, the lower Great
Lakes, northern New England, northeastern Florida, Kentucky and
Tennessee.
   Today's forecast called for severe thunderstorms in the southern
and central Plains; showers and thunderstorms from the southern and
central Plains through the lower Mississippi Valley to Georgia and
the Carolinas. Thunderstorms were expected to be severe in the
Plains region. Showers were forecast from New England across the
lower Great Lakes, Michigan, southeast Wisconsin, northern Indiana
and northern Ohio, as well as from Pennsylvania and New Jersey
across the Virginias. Showers also were expected from Montana
across Wyoming, much of Colorado, Utah and eastern Nevada.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 50s and 60s from New England
across the Appalachians, the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley and
eastern Tennessee, and from Montana across Colorado, from Idaho
across central Arizona, northern Nevada and the California coast.
Highs were expected to reach the 90s over southern Florida and
south central Texas. Highs elsewhere were forecast to be in the 70s
and 80s.
   Temperatures at 2 a.m. EDT ranged from 38 degrees at Craig,
Colo., Oscoda, Mich., and Sheridan, Wyo., to 80 degrees at Corpus
Christi, Texas.

<HEAD>Mexico Says Noriega Has Aggravated Situation in Panama</HEAD>
<UNK>With PM-Panama</UNK>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unusually critical statement, Mexico
has urged Panama's government to heed the will of its people, who
international observers say rejected the rule of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega in last week's election.
   A communique issued on Sunday by the Foreign Ministry expressed
``profound dismay over what is occurring in Panama.''
   Independent foreign observers say forces loyal to Noriega rigged
the May 7 election and that the opposition presidential candidate
won. The government nullified the election results on Wednesday,
the same day pro-Noriega thugs beat the top three opposiition
candidates.
   The Mexican Foreign Ministry said the events distance ``that
sister country from the democratic community of Latin America,''
and that the situation was ``aggravated by a high level of
confrontation and violence that has resulted in public violation of
human rights.''
   Mexico staunchly defends the priniciples of non-intervention in
other countries and usually does not publicly criticize other
nations.
   The foreign ministers of the Organization of American States are
to meet Wednesday in Washington to discuss the situation in Panama.
   The Foreign Ministry's communique said the OAS could defend
democracy in the hemisphere best through support for human rights
but could not ``become a court of last resort for electoral
processes in the American countries.''
   ``It is regrettable that the Panamanian situation has been
aggravated by the personal attitude of Gen. Noriega, whose moral
and ethical reputation is one of discredit, and who until now has
placed his personal interests over those of the Panamanian
people,'' it said.
   The statement urged Panamanian officials to ``show proof of
political maturity and try to solve their internal conflicts within
the framework of respect for popular will and human, civic and
political rights of the Panamanians.''
   The Panama Canal Treaties, under which the United States is to
turn full control of the waterway over to Panama at the end of
1999, should be fulfilled, the statement said.
   Noriega has claimed that Washington indicted him on
drug-trafficking charges last year and began working for his ouster
as a pretext for justifying its planned abrogation of the treaties.

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Cites Frederick Douglass; Syracuse Remebers Bombing
Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   First lady Barbara Bush asked graduates to follow in the
footsteps of Frederick Douglass and help people ``enslaved by
ignorance,'' while Syracuse University paid tribute to the students
who died in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   In other commencements Sunday, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee
Iacocca declared ``The American Century'' is over and Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor advised graduates that the key to
rising to the top is spending time at the bottom.
   ``Someday in your lives, the walls will part and you'll see a
little Frederick Douglass,'' Mrs. Bush said in ceremonies at
Bennett College, a predominantly black, liberal arts school for
women in Greensboro, N.C.
   Mrs. Bush, who was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane
letters, said Douglass had been one of her heroes since she read
the autobiography of the one-time slave who became a scholar and
writer.
   The first lady said she was particularly struck by Douglass'
account of overhearing his owner admonishing his wife not to teach
slaves to read because it would make them impossible to control.
   ``Frederick Douglass' revelation holds true today,'' Mrs. Bush
said. ``There are many types of slavery, and education is the key
to freedom.''
   Graduation ceremonies at Syracuse began with a moment of silence
for the 35 students in the university's international program who
died when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Scotland last December.
Richard Phillips, dean of the university's Hendricks Chapel, read a
poem by one of the victims, Shannon Davis.
   In the commencement address, U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan
told more than 5,000 graduates the class of 1989 ``might just hug
yourselves for sheer luck'' at leaving college at a time when
totalitarianism is ending.
   ``It means you aren't going to go to war,'' the New York
Democrat said. ``You aren't going to die before ever having lived.
Civilization is not going to die. The planet is not going to die.''
   His Republican New York colleague, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, touched
on a similar theme at St. Bonaventure University in Olean, N.Y.
   ``The great nightmares that haunted the lives of your parents
and my generation _ the twin terrors of nuclear war and
totalitarian aggression _ today seem to be fading,'' D'Amato said.
   In East Rutherford, N.J., Iacocca told about 2,100 Fairleigh
Dickinson University graduates they would have to take the lead in
making the country competitive on the global market.
   ``It's going to take hard work,'' Iacocca said. ``It's going to
take pragmatism, and frankly, it's going to take getting just a
little bit mad at the policies and the people who would say that
America has to settle for being second best.''
   O'Connor, the first woman Supreme Court justice, told the 210
graduates of Rockford College in Rockford, Ill., how a job
collecting unpaid grocery bills in a law office taught her to ``do
the best you can, no matter how insignificant it may seem at the
time.
   ``People don't ordinarily look forward to starting at the
bottom,'' she said. ``While you may be a lowly foot soldier ... no
one knows more about solving a problem than the person at the
bottom.''
   In other commencement ceremonies Sunday:
   _ Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told graduates at the University
of Wyoming in Laramie that President Bush's decision to send an
additional 2,000 U.S. troops to Panama was ``a step that a prudent
man would take.''
   _ Jazz great Dizzy Gillespie handed out diplomas and words of
encouragement to the 455 graduates of Boston's Berklee College of
Music. The commencement address was by British composer-producer
George Martin, best known for launching the Beatles in 1962.
   _ Civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks spoke to 78 graduating
students at Bradford College in Haverhill, Mass., and received an
honorary degree.

   Sunny weather and strong legs got the city through
a morning rush hour today despite a 24-hour bus and subway strike
that had millions of Londoners finding new ways to get to work.
   Only 11 subway trains and 10 double-decker buses operated during
the morning rush hour as train operators staged an unofficial
strike and bus drivers carried out a legal protest. Both were
striking for more pay.
   A sixth of the trains on British Rail's southern region were
canceled because of an overtime ban by train drivers and because
some staff were unable to get to work, the railroad said.
   Those who came in cars found traffic heavy and slow, but fears
of horrendous traffic jams did not materialize.
   ``I think people were expecting it to be bad and it was bad, but
we have had worse congestion,'' said Mary Ann Randle of the
Automobile Association.
   Many pedestrians, accustomed to letting others navigate, were
seen consulting maps or asking other walkers for directions.
   The buses and subway alone account for some seven million
passenger journeys a day.

   A man who survived a Nazi concentration
camp made good on his dream, cutting the ribbon on a $3.6 million
village that will house an estimated 2,200 terminally ill children
and their families this year.
   ``I had been just like some of these children, waiting for
death, and I know what that means,'' said hotelier Henri Landwirth,
61, the driving force behind the Holiday Inn Kids Village.
   The village, operated by the Give Kids the World organization,
provides free weeklong vacations to terminally ill children and
their families.
   Landwirth, a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp during World
War II, began Give Kids the World in April 1986 to help terminally
ill children live out their lives as pleasantly as possible.
   At Saturday's cermonies, a tearful Landwirth praised Holiday
Inns Inc. and community members who had pulled together to build
the village. ``There are no limits when a great idea and a caring
community get together.''
   Former CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite was among the
dignitaries on hand for the formal dedication of the complex,
located near Walt Disney World and other Central Florida
attractions.
   ``It's a marvelous outpouring of human kindness,'' Cronkite
said. ``We are all the sum of our experiences. Henri, having
survived the Holocaust .... well his heart grew big.''
   The village is made of 16 two-family villas, a specially
designed swimming pool, a pirate's ship in its own lagoon, a
fishing pier and a fire truck parked in the middle of a playground.
Twenty-nine children and their families are staying in the villas.

   The rear stairway door of a TWA jet
carrying 59 people opened in midflight, but the plane flew the
remaining 300 miles to its destination and landed safely, an
official said.
   The open door caused no pressure problems in the cabin of the
Boeing 727, en route from New York to Columbus Saturday afternoon,
because an inide door separated the cabin from the outside, said
Paul Long, a control tower supervisor at Port Columbus
International Airport.
   The door was used as an emergency exit or occasional alternate
entrance to the plane, he said.
   ``They (the door and stairs) just dropped open,'' Long said.
``For whatever reason, the latch did not hold it.''
   Flight 402 had left New York's Kennedy Airport and was flying
over Pennsylvania when the pilot reported the stairway door had
opened, Long said. The plane landed safely 45 minutes later and was
repaired Saturday night.

   Roy Kenneth Sanford, 23, was captured Sunday while walking in a

Talton.
   Sanford escaped Saturday after he pulled what looked like a
semi-automatic weapon on three guards and ordered another inmate to
open a cellblock door.
   ``At first glance, it looked like the real thing,'' Talton said.
``Of course, when you looked close you could tell it wasn't.
   ``He even used an eye from a shoe, like you run shoelaces

too.''
   The gun had been carved from two bars of soap and painted black,
Talton said.
   Sanford, serving time for armed robbery and kidnapping, was also
one of seven inmates who escaped the Houston County jail two months

   An anti-corruption crusader today defeated more
than two dozen other candidates to win a parliamentary seat despite
running afoul of the Kremlin for associating top government
officials with a corruption probe.
   Preliminary returns showed criminal investigator Nikolai Ivanov
won 61 percent of the vote in Leningrad, said Lyudmilla Imanenko,
deputy head of the Tass news agency in the country's second-largest
city.
   In Sunday's second round of voting for 198 remaining seats in
the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, Ivanov was pitted
against more than two dozen other candidates to represent Leningrad.
   The congress, created by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
convenes on May 25 and will chose the president and a new sitting
legislature or Supreme Soviet.
   Ivanov and his partner, Telman Gdlyan, are known throughout the
Soviet Union for a lengthy probe of corruption in the republic of
Uzbekistan. Gdlyan won a parliamentary seat in the first March 26
vote, receiving almost 87 percent of ballots in a Moscow district.
   But Ivanov ran afoul of the Kremlin in the last days of his
campaign by saying in a debate televised in Leningrad that the
names of Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev and other top officials
came up in his continuing corruption probe.
   In the eastern Ukrainian city Kharkov, officials said
preliminary data showed editor Vitaly Korotich of the
reform-oriented Ogonyok magazine had easily defeated nine other
candidates with 80 percent of the vote.
   Strong showings by Ivanov, Korotich and reform candidates in the
restive Baltic republics continued a trend set in the March
elections, which favored reformist and anti-establishment
candidates.
   That ballot was the first nationwide multi-candidate election in
the Soviet Union in 70 years.
   In Estonia, Klara Hallik, a lecturer and expert on ethnic
relations at Tallinn Polytechnical Institute, won 50.74 percent of
the vote. She was backed by the Estonian People's Front.
   In neighboring Latvia, voters handed reformer Maveriks Vulfsons
a narrow victory in a Riga district. People's Front officials in
the republic said their candidates won five of the six races there.
   Voters in Kiev narrowed a slate of 33 candidates to two.
Economist Vladimir Chernyak, a leader of the Ukrainian People's
Front, will face editor Vitaly Karpenko of the official newspaper
Vecherny Kiev in a third vote, said local election official Lydia
Voronova.
   The People's Front grassroots movements seek economic
independence from Moscow.
   In Moscow, Olympic weight-lifting champion Yuri Vlasov was
seeking a seat from the Lublinsky region. Reformist playwright
Mikhail Shatrov and Afghanistan war hero Alexander Rudskoy were
among the candidates in the Kuntsovsky district.
   In the religious center Zagorsk, well-known news commentator
Alexander Bovin and conservative editor Anatoly Ivanov were among
the candidates.
   In the March elections, voters embarrassed dozens of local
Communist Party and government officials in Leningrad, Kiev, Moscow
and other major cities.
   Most of those who lost in March did not run again.
   The new parliament will choose the president and a new sitting
legislature or Supreme Soviet, but many of its functions and
procedures have yet to be decided.
   Repeat elections were held in 195 districts where voters were
given a choice of only one or two candidates on March 26 and
refused to elect anyone.
   In three districts of Armenia, elections were held Sunday
because fewer than half the voters went to the polls in March.
   Ivanov and Gdlyan became national heroes last summer when an
article they wrote for Korotich's magazine led to a dramatic
confrontation on nationwide television. Korotich handed Gorbachev a
list of delegates to the June Communist Party conference who were
implicated in bribery.
   But recently the Kremlin has come down hard on the prosecutors.
   The leadership of the Supreme Soviet attacked the two in a
statement published election eve in the Communist Party daily
Pravda, accusing them of trying to ``interfere in the work of a
specially formed commission'' looking into complaints about their
investigative practices.

   Tamil guerrillas bombed a military
truck, killing 10 Indian peacekeeping soldiers in the northern
Jaffna Peninsula, Sri Lankan military officials said today.
   One guerrilla was killed and two were wounded when survivors of
the Sunday night attack opened fire, said officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Meanwhile, the extremist Sinhalese People's Liberation Front
denied reports its leader is ill and seeking government permission
to go abroad for treatment.
   Tamil civilians in Vavuniya quoted travelers as saying the Tamil
Tiger guerrillas set off a remote-controlled bomb when the Indian
soldiers' truck reached Mirusuvil, east of Jaffna. The town is
nearly 200 miles north of the capital, Colombo.
   They said the dead man was a local leader of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   The Vavuniya residents said three civilians also were killed
when their bus was caught in the crossfire. But military officials
said they know of no civilian deaths.
   On Saturday, at least 12 Indian soldiers and 18 Tamil rebels
were killed in fighting near Nedunkernie, 45 miles southeast of
Mirusuvil, an Indian High Commission spokeswoman said on condition
of anonymity.
   Tamil guerrillas have been fighting since 1983 for a separate
homeland in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, where they form a
majority of the population. Since then, at least 9,000 people have
died, mostly Sinhalese civilians massacred by the separatists.
Attacks on civilians have tapered off since the Tigers, largest of
the guerrills groups, opened peace talks with the government this
month.
   Indian peacekeepers were sent to Sri Lanka in July 1987 to
enforce a peace accord. But the guerrillas, after initially
accepting the accord, reneged and began attacking Indians.
   Tamils say the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise 75
percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, discriminate against
them. Like Indians, most Tamils are Hindu.
   The government peace overtures have prompted a backlash among
extremist Sinhalese, such as the People's Liberation Front, who say
too many concessions have been made. Officials blame front
guerrillas for the deaths of 3,500 people, mostly Sinhalese
government officials and supporters, since 1987.
   On Monday, Colombo newspapers received a front statement denying
its leader, Rohana Wijeweera, wants to seek medical treatment in
Britain.
   Wijeweera, 46, reportedly suffered a heart attack recently.
   On Thursday, a British Broadcasting Corp. correspondent in
Colombo said he received two telephone calls from a front member
who said his group was ready to begin peace talks if Wijeweera was
allowed to travel to London for medical treatment.

<HEAD>Judge Tosses Out Amherst College's Snowball Suit Against UMass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTHAMPTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge gave Amherst College the cold
shoulder, tossing out a lawsuit that tried to halt an annual
snowball fight between students at Amherst and the nearby
University of Massachusetts.
   Hampshire Superior Court Judge John F. Moriarty said it was
``beyond the powers of a court comprised only of human judges'' to
keep students from engaging in hijinks.
   Amherst had asked the court to order the University of
Massachusetts to keep its 25,000 students from throwing snowballs
at those attending the private college, which has 1,500 students.
   They contended that the snow battle has led to vandalism and
several thousand dollars of damage to college property. An Amherst
student was hospitalized last December after being hit in the eye
with an icy missile.
   In a decision filed Friday, Moriarty said it was beyond the
powers of the court to stop criminal acts before they take place.
   Also, he added, ``Most university students are technically
adults, although at least some of them obviously retain juvenile
propensity, so not even their parents ... can be held responsible
for their off-campus antics.''
   UMass Chancellor Joseph Duffey called the verdict ``literate and
written with a bit of whimsy,'' and said it was the kind of classic
document every college administrator should have framed and hung on
the wall.

   A naval helicopter crashed about 10 miles
north of this Indian Ocean port, killing eight British sailors as
they headed for shore leave, officials said today.
   Police officials in Mombasa, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, said the helicopter was bringing a party ashore from the
HMS Brilliant, one of four frigates assigned to patrol duty in the
Persian Gulf.
   There were no survivors and one official said ``I think you can
assume the ninth man is also dead.'' The eight bodies were found in
the wreckage of the helicopter, which burned on impact.
   The crew of the Brilliant was scheduled for a short period of
shore leave and relaxation in Mombasa, a resort town that is a
frequent port of call for British and U.S. Navy ships.
   The British Embassy in Nairobi confirmed the deaths in Sunday's
crash, but referred all further inquiries to the admiralty press
office in London.
   Identities of the dead and missing were not available.

   Tupelo, Miss., has a new claim to fame. The
hometown of Elvis Presley can now add All-America City to its name.
   Tupelo was among 10 cities honored Saturday night at the 40th
annual All-America City Awards for programs ranging from drug-abuse
prevention efforts to building soccer fields.
   ``A lot of people ask me, being from Tupelo, `Is Elvis still
alive?''' Mayor Jack Marshall said in accepting the award. ``Elvis
is dead but the spirit lives on _ the spirit of Tupelo.''
   The nine other winners were: Phoenix; Inglewood, Calif.;
Greeley, Colo.; Peoria, Ill., Salina, Kan.; New Bedford, Mass.;
Dunn, N.C.; New Bern, N.C.; and Roanoke County, Va.
   Gregg Petersmeyer, a White House staffer with the Office of
National Service, said all 30 cities chosen as finalists in the
competition should be proud.
   ``The 30 finalists represent communities that have chosen to
pour themselves into common problems,'' Petersmeyer said in a
speech to the awards dinner.
   Officials from the finalist cities went before the 12 judges
Friday and Saturday and presented a 20-minute program on five
criteria: community leadership, citizen participation, government
performance, civic education and community volunteerism and
philanthropy.
   The 30 communities, drawn from a pool of 109 applicants, ranged
in size from Palmer, Alaska, with a population of 3,000, to
Phoenix, with more than 1 million residents.

   A pastor preached to his
congregation from behind bars while facing federal drug trafficking
charges.
   The Rev. Joseph L. Davis delivered his Sunday sermon by
telephone from his jail cell at the St. Clair County Jail in nearby
Belleville to his supporters at East St. Louis' 15th Street Baptist
Church.
   The sermon, appropriately enough, was titled, ``Locked Up, But
Not Locked In.''
   ``They can lock up this body of mine, but my mind and my soul
and my spirit they have no control over _ that belongs to God,''
Davis said later in a telephone interview from his jail cell with
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
   Davis was arrested in March on federal charges of drug
trafficking, conspiracy to sell cocaine and money laundering. If
convicted on all charges, he faces a maximum penalty of two life
sentences. His trial is scheduled June 5.
   After the worship services, about 25 supporters of Davis held a
news conference to declare that the congregation still stands
behind its pastor.
   ``We believe in his innocence,'' said the Rev. Ephraim Thomas,
an associate minister at East St. Louis' Mount Zion Baptist Church
who has been serving as acting pastor of Davis' church for the past
three weeks.
   ``We expect him to be back in the church.''

   Here are excerpts from the toasts of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Chinese President Yang Shangkun
at a state banquet tonight in the Great Hall of the People.
   Gorbachev:
   The way toward this meeting was not an easy one; it required
from both sides wisdom, responsibility and perseverance in removing
the negative aggravations and prejudices that marred our relations
for so many years. ...
   The current decade has unveiled China's new image to the world.
Soviet people applaud and understand the enthusiasm that impels
your country in its desire for modernization in all spheres of
social life.
   The strides toward industrialization, transformation of agrarian
relations, releasing of the people's consciousness and initiative,
enrichment of the intellectual culture of the Chinese society _ all
this has been brought about by bold and far-reaching reforms which
are followed with keen interest all over the world.
   We wish the leaders and the people of China every success in
resolving the problems they face in this path and ensuring steady
progress of their socialist motherland. ...
   Socialism is entering a new stage in its development where full
use will be made of its creative potential. ...
   But it is no less true the world remains fragile and vulnerable.
... The risk of an ecological disaster is growing since nature is
no longer capable of neutralizing the waste of the technological
civilization and needs urgent help.
   There remains a most pressing problem of eliminating hunger and
poverty, of overcoming the economic underdevelopment of many
countries. ...
   Humanity is now at a crossroads. The next few years will be
critical in determining whether humanity will be able to travel
along the road of light and to curb the looming threats, or
civilization will slide toward its end.
   We believe in a happy outcome, in a better future. ...
   Both the Soviet Union and China are independent in terms of
decision-making: each has its own priorities, our views are not
always identical. Yet, there exists a broad area in which such
interaction is both possible and appropriate. ... The improvement
of Soviet-Chinese relations is not directed against any third
country. In the final analysis, the entire world community stands
to gain from that improvement.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Yang:
   Sino-Soviet relations traversed a tortuous course in the past.
Today, we have come to a new starting point. ...
   It has not been easy for leaders of our two countries to come to
this historic meeting. We on both sides must value and safeguard
what has already been achieved and continue to address the
remaining problems. ...
   Ten years ago, we embarked on the road of reform and opening up,
and since then China has undergone great changes.
   Despite various difficulties, twists and turns we may still
encounter on our road of advance, we are confident that we will
overcome all difficulties, free ourselves from poverty and
backwardness and attain our anticipated goals so long as we adhere
to leadership by the Communist Party and to the socialist road,
persist in reform and the open policy and continue to blaze new
trails by relying on the united struggle of the Chinese people. ...
   The Chinese people have followed your reform with interest and
wish you success. ...
   Now, I would like to invite you all to drink a toast to the
normalization of Sino-Soviet relations.

Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush is unveiling a package of
anti-crime proposals that include a permanent ban on imports of
semiautomatic assault-style rifles, a crackdown on criminals using
guns and $1 billion for new prisons, officials say.
   Bush's crime-fighting package, which he was to announce in a
speech on the Capitol steps today, is focused on tougher treatment
of criminals through increased enforcement efforts and stiffer
sentences.
   He also has decided to make permanent a temporary suspension he
imposed in March that stopped semiautomatic assault-style rifles
from coming into the country, officials said in advance of the
address.
   The weapons banned will be those that have come to be used for
criminal rather than sporting purposes as determined by an ongoing
review by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said an
agency official who declined to be identified.
   Current law provides that only sporting weapons can be imported,
but the standards now will be tightened and enforced to exclude
that many previously allowed in will be excluded, the official said.
   Other administration sources have said Bush is calling for a
death penalty for drug ``kingpins,'' a position he advocated in his
election campaign last year, and for those who commit terrorist
acts against Americans abroad.
   Bush also is seeking $1 billion from Congress for prison
construction and enlargement _ enough to provide capacity for up to
29,000 new prisoners, deputy White House chief of staff Andrew Card
Jr. said Sunday.
   The $1 billion would be spent over the next four years.
   Officials said Bush also is asking for more money for law
enforcement officers and prosecutors and will advocate stiffened
penalties for those who use guns. Use of assault-style weapons
would bring even harsher sentences.
   Included in the plan is money for 375 additional ATF agents, 300
FBI agents and 150 deputy U.S. marshals.
   But the most intense attention has focused on whether the
president would extend the suspension of imports of the
semiautomatic rifles. The guns are a favorite of street criminals,
becoming more prevalent especially in drug-related crimes, but some
models are used by hunters as well, according to gun owners.
   Card said that while the president was still reviewing the final
package, his speech at today's ceremony honoring slain police
officers would state an intention to make that import ban permanent.
   Card said the president would advocate a ``hard look'' at
restricting domestically produced weapons, many of which are
virtually identical to the banned imports. But the president
apparently decided not to ban sales in the domestic market at this
point.
   Bush on March 14 imposed a temporary ban on imported
assault-style weapons _ including Soviet-developed AK-47s and
Israeli-made Uzis.
   He launched a survey by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and
Firearms to review whether any of these weapons are imported for
sporting purposes. Under current law, that is the only permissible
reason for which they can enter the country. The review is to be
completed in about mid-June.
   Card told reporters in Lexington, Ky., as Bush prepared to
return to the capital after a three-day swing through Texas and
Mississippi, that the review would determine which of the models
would be permanently barred.
   ``We'll see what definitions these weapons fall under,'' said
Card.
   The definition issue promises to be a sticky one, especially
since many of the imports have the same characteristics as
domestically produced rifles.
   During his 1988 presidential campaign, Bush called for
converting unneeded military bases into state and federal prisons,
and for using money seized from drug dealers to help pay for
additional prison space _ proposals also expected to be reflected
in the new package.
   ``The crime problem is not easily solved by one bill alone,''
Card said. ``We'll also be looking for the states to do some
things. This is not the do-all and end-all. This is just a
significant beginning.''
   Bush returned to Washington on Sunday morning after attending
church in Versailles, Ky. He spoke at graduations Friday and
Saturday in Texas and Mississippi.
   In Kentucky, he spoke at a $1.3 million dinner Saturday night
for GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell's 1990 re-election.
   Bush also during the trip issued a call to the people and
national defense forces of Panama to rise up and oust that
country's ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Bush stopped short of specifically calling for a coup, but said
the Panamanians should get Noriega out.
   The Bush administration has denounced Noriega for rigging last
Sunday's election, and when Noriega nullified it accused him of
throwing away the results because his candidate lost despite the
fraud.

   About 3,000 students on a hunger strike camped in
Tiananmen Square for a third day today, forcing Chinese authorities
to change welcoming ceremonies for Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   About 140,000 supporters of the hunger strikers crowded into the
square. Officials met with more than 50 students but protest
leaders said the delegation did not represent the demonstrators.
   Yan Mingfu, a member of the ruling Communist Party Central
Committee Secretariat, told students at the meeting that the
month-long movement was patriotic. But said ``there has been a
negative impact on the dignity of the country,'' according to the
official Xinhua News Agency.
   The students who met with officials were from state-sanctioned
unions, which have been rejected by the pro-democracy student
movement.
   Students at Tiananmen said the officials made no promises before
the talks broke off after three hours.
   ``We have no choice but to continue the hunger strike until the
government gives in,'' said a student leader from the Northern
Communications College.
   The students reported over a loudspeaker in Tiananmen that
70,000 of 220,000 workers at the Capital Steel Plant went on strike
today in support of the pro-democracy movement.
   ``They carried signs ... saying they would do their best to
support the students,'' said a Beijing Medical Union student.
   The students had hoped to pressure the government into
concessions by threatening to disrupt a welcoming ceremony for
Gorbachev, who arrived today for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in
30 years.
   But when it became clear the square could be cleared only with
force, the ceremony was held at the airport instead of at the Great
Hall of the People beside the plaza.
   Most of the students, who admire Gorbachev's domestic reform
campaign, moved to the opposite side of the vast square early today
in deference. But they refused to leave altogether and new groups
of students and several dozen teachers joined them throughout the
day.
   ``Maybe I will set myself on fire,'' one sobbing female
hunger-striker screamed into a loudspeaker that the strikers ran
off car batteries.
   The decision to move Gorbachev's welcome clearly embarrassed the
government but also indicated its determination not to give in to
student demands.
   About 80 of the 1,800 students who began to fast on Saturday
afternoon in the shadeless square had been taken to hospitals
suffering from dehydration, sunstroke and exposure, said doctors
who stood by with ambulances.
   Medical students handed out glucose, salt tablets and packets of
traditional Chinese medicine to strikers who felt faint.
   Water and salt supplies were running short, the medics said, and
they issued urgent appeals for money.
   The strikers' spirits were raised in the afternoon by the
appearance of several thousand intellectuals, led by Beijing
University teachers and including writers and scholars.
   ``Long live the teachers,'' students yelled. ``You give us
infinite strength.''
   One 44-year-old chemistry teacher said, ``We think the students
have raised reasonable requests and we think the government should
have a dialogue with them as equals.''
   He said 90 percent of the university's teachers back the student
movement, the biggest ever to confront the Communist government.
   The hunger strikers were surrounded by nearly 30,000 supporting
students from more than two dozen Beijing schools. Thousands of
local residents flooded the square and some gave speeches of
support.
   Students have been marching and holding sit-ins, marches and
class boycotts since April 15 to demand democracy in their
authoritarian nation.
   Hundreds of police moved into public buildings around the square
throughout the day, but did not re-emerge to confront the crowd.
   Hunger-Strike leaders said they had not been in contact with
authorities since talks broke down Sunday night.
   The government has rejected student demands to recognize the
organizations and broadcast the discussions.
   The students want a dialogue on the government's failure to
enforce constitutional guarantees of free speech and press, on
economic and political reforms and on a re-evaluation of the
student movement.
   Officials of the Beijing Institute of Science and Technology
arrived with wicker baskets of steamed bread for those students not
hunger striking.
   Most of the strikers lay on the ground or sat propped against
each other, smoking, reading and sleeping.
   ``My stomach doesn't hurt anymore _ it's numb,'' said a student
from the Central Nationalities Institute's English department.

   The army today blew up or sealed 13 houses of
Palestinians suspected of killing alleged collaborators with Israel
or attacking soldiers and police in the West Bank.
   The move came a day after the Cabinet voted 20-6 to approve a
plan for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to
choose Palestinian representatives for talks with Israel on an
interim settlement.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir considers the plan a step toward
permanent peace, but many Palestinians criticize it for not linking
balloting to the eventual creation of an independent Palestinian
state.
   In the occupied lands, Palestinians observed a general strike
today to protest the displacement of more than 600,000 Palestinians
after Israel was founded on May 15, 1948.
   In the West Bank village of Beita, residents stoned seven Jewish
settler who were hiking, the army said. The settlers fled to a
nearby hill and repeatedly fired in the air before soldiers rescued
them. No injuries were reported.
   Settler leader Benny Katzover charged Monday's hikers showed too
much restraint. ``They had five guns. The fact that no Arabs were
wounded is a sign of weakness,'' Katzover said on Israel radio.
   Also Monday, new army figures showed 61 Palestinians have been
killed by plastic bullets since the ammunition was introduced in
August.
   Gen. Ehud Barak, the army deputy chief of staff, was quoted by
Israel radio as saying the plastic bullets helped reduce the number
of Palestinians killed in army gunfire from 204 in the first eight
months of the uprising to 151 in the following eight months.
   The Associated Press has counted 474 Palestinian deaths, most
when Israeli soldiers fired on stone-throwers, since the rebellion
began in December 1987. Twenty-one Israelis also have died.
   In the West Bank, the army blew up six houses today in the city
of Nablus, the refugee camps of Balata and Arrub, and the village
of Deir Nidham. Troops sealed four houses in Nablus and three in
Hebron.
   The homeowners in Nablus were accused of killing two alleged
collaborators, the army said. Arabs have killed more than 40
Palestinians in the uprising.
   Suspects in Arrub allegedly fired at an army unit in February
1988 but the bullets struck a local woman who died of her wounds.
The Deir Nidham man allegedly stabbed and injured a border police
officer in February.
   Western nations, including the United States, have condemned
house demolitions and sealings as a violation of the right to due
process because punishment usually comes before suspects are tried.
   An army spokeswoman could not say what legal proceedings were
being taken against those whose houses were destroyed or sealed
today.
   More than 170 houses have been demolished and more than 70
others sealed during the uprising, according to army figures.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, army commander of the West Bank,
defended the practice.
   ``These are murder gangs, and some of them got their orders from
outside to carry out murders of people considered to be helping
Israel,'' he said on Israel radio. ``We won't allow this to happen.
We will punish them severely.''
   In southern Israel, meanwhile, additional police were deployed
to prevent attacks on Palestinians from the Gaza Strip driving to
their jobs in the Israeli coastal cities of Ashkelon and Ashdod.
   Hundreds of Israelis from the two cities in the past week have
stoned Arab-owned cars to avenge the slaying of an army sergeant
and the disappearance of a second soldier, both blamed on
Palestinians.
   On Sunday, three masked assailants entered an Ashkelon bakery
and beat two Palestinian workers who were hospitalized briefly.

<HEAD>Court Accepts One Chemical Labeling Case, Turns Back Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to resolve a
dispute stemming from the federal government's efforts to protect
American workers from hazardous chemicals.
   The court said it will hear the Bush administration's argument
that a federal appeals court wrongly required that additional
information be supplied to employees.
   At the same time, the justices turned away arguments by
non-manufacturing employers that labeling and other
employee-education requirements were imposed improperly on them.
   The Reagan administration in 1983 published a final standard for
``evaluating and communicating chemical hazards to employees in the
manufacturing sector.''
   After the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that the standard was applied too narrowly, government
regulators applied it in 1987 to non-manufacturing employers as
well _ from dry-cleaners to the construction industry.
   The standard requires chemical manufacturers and importers to
label chemical containers and send safety information to all
customers. Those customers are required to ensure that the
container labels remain affixed, to make safety information
accessible to employees in their work areas.
   Employers also are required to prepare a written
hazard-communications program that, among other things, contains a
list of the hazardous chemicals used in the workplace and to train
employees on the proper use of such chemicals.
   Several of the provisions in the 1987 standard were disapproved
by the Office of Management and Budget, which reviewed the standard
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
   But the 3rd Circuit court later ruled that OMB was unauthorized
to disapprove of any provisions in the standard. The appeals court
restored the 1987 standard to the form in which it was issued.
   In two appeals denied review today, the Associated General
Contractors of America, the Construction Industry Trade
Association, the National Grain &amp; Feed Association and other
employers contended that the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration improperly extended the hazard-communication
standard to non-manufacturers.
   In a third appeal, federal regulators argued that the appeals
court wrongly limited OMB's authority to revise the standard. It
was the only appeal granted review _ making the high court's review
a narrow one.
   Sweeping new standards for worker exposure to nearly 400
hazardous materials took effect earlier this year in the first
overhaul since passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act 17
years ago.
   The new standards cover about 21 million American workers.
   The cases are Associated General Contractors vs. OSHA, 88-1070;
National Grain &amp; Feed Association vs. OSHA, 88-1385; and Dole vs.
U.S. Steelworkers, 88-1434.

<HEAD>Court to Review Pennsylvania Ruling on Aid to Disabled Kids</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to review a
ruling that makes it easier for disabled children to win some
federal welfare benefits.
   The justices said they will hear a Bush administration appeal
aimed at overturning a ruling that could force the government to
re-evaluate benefits for more than 250,000 children.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last August ruled in favor
of disabled children seeking Supplemental Security Income benefits
from the Department of Health and Human Services.
   The benefits are provided to the disabled of all ages.
   An adult is considered disabled if he or she ``is unable to
engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any
medically determinable physical or mental impairment'' lasting at
least a year.
   Children under 18 are considered disabled if they suffer ``from
any medically determinable physical or mental impairment of
comparable severity.''
   The Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit court said the definitions
were being interpreted by HHS in a way that illegally made it more
difficult for children to qualify.
   The appeals court said that if an adult's medical condition does
not meet one of those listed in HHS regulations, he or she is
entitled to an individual assessment to determine the extent of the
functional impairment.
   The HHS rules do not permit such individual determinations for
children, the appeals court said.
   ``If a child's medical findings do not meet or equal the
listings, the child may not be found to be disabled regardless of
the severity of the actual impairment,'' the appeals court found.
   It ordered HHS to revise the rules to give children ``the
opportunity for individual evaluations comparable'' to those for
adults.
   Administration lawyers said treating adults differently makes
sense because they are evaluated with regard to their ability to
work.
   The appeals court ruling was triggered initially by the case of
Brian Zebley, a Pennsylvania boy who suffers from congenital brain
damage that has caused retardation and other problems. The
government cut off his supplemental benefits when Brian turned 4 in
1982.
   Legal papers submitted to the high court did not list a hometown
for the boy.
   Government lawyers said the 3rd Circuit court ruling has broad
impact because the case has been turned into a class-action lawsuit
potentially involving disabled children nationwide.
   The government's appeal said the appeals court ruling could
force HHS to re-evaluate more than 250,000 cases in which children
have been denied benefits between 1983 and 1988. HHS estimates the
cost of the re-evaluations alone would be more than $41 million.
   The case is Sullivan vs. Zebley, 88-1377.

   Six people convicted of trespass for their
participation in a 1986 protest demonstration at a Houston abortion
clinic lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that state
courts wrongly refused to consider as a defense that the trespass
was justified to protect fetal life.
   The appeal sought, among other things, the overturning of the
court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which said women have a
constitutional right to abortion.
   The justices already have under study a Missouri
abortion-regulation case in which they are being asked to reverse
or substantially limit the landmark 1973 ruling.
   In the case acted on today, James C. Bobo, Margaret Fall Harper,
David Ray Marshall, Marjorie Nelson, Leon Spivey and John D. White
were convicted of criminal trespass in connection with a Sept. 20,
1986 demonstration at the West Loop Clinic in Houston.
   In all, 18 people were arrested for chaining the clinic's front
door from the inside, blocking an emergency exit with a van,
chaining themselves to waiting room chairs and refusing to leave
until police came three hours after their entry.
   The protesters sang, chanted, banged on the walls and prayed
during the demonstration.
   The six protesters who appealed were sentenced to probated jail
terms and fined from $650 to $1,000.
   The justices previously have rejected similar appeals by
anti-abortion protesters who have participated in various
``rescues'' at abortion clinics in other states.
   The case is Bobo vs. Texas, 88-1536.

   The Supreme Court today refused to hear an
appeal by two Sioux Indian tribes seeking land they surrendered to
the federal government 121 years ago.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the tribes
were forced illegally in 1987 to accept financial compensation for
the land given up in 1868.
   The tribes contend that the 1987 settlement was agreed to by a
lawyer who no longer represented them.
   The Sioux Indian Nation signed an 1868 treaty with the
government giving up land in North and South Dakota, Nebraska,
Wyoming and Montana.
   By 1890, the Sioux had split into a number of different tribes.
Today there are eight tribes.
   The tribes asked the Indian Claims Commission in 1950 for
compensation for the land they had surrendered.
   After 30 years of administrative and legal proceedings, the
commission awarded the Sioux $43.9 million. But that award did not
end the case.
   Left to be decided was how much money the government could
deduct for compensation already paid to the tribes.
   The U.S. Claims Court in 1987 accepted a stipulation of facts
that reduced the money owed the Sioux by $3.7 million. The sum
included $2.7 million the government had paid for the land plus
expenditures for education, food and other provisions.
   Agreeing to the stipulation on behalf of the Sioux was Arthur
Lazarus, a District of Columbia lawyer who had represented the
tribes since their claim was filed in 1950.
   The two largest tribes, the Oglala Sioux and the Rosebud Sioux,
protested that they had not renewed their contract with Lazarus and
that he no longer represented them.
   They said they did not give their consent to the $3.7 million
stipulation.
   But the U.S. Claims Court, remarking that the tribes wanted land
and not money, rejected efforts by the two tribes to withdraw from
the overall $40.2 million settlement.
   ``It is too late in the game to do this now,'' the claims court
said.
   A federal appeals court here upheld the claims court ruling last
November. ``We agree with the claims court that in these
circumstances, the tribes were required to do something more than
not renew their attorney's contracts if they wished to terminate
their attorney's authority to represent them,'' the appeals court
said.
   The two tribes, noting that Lazarus and other lawyers who worked
with him were awarded $4.2 million in legal fees, said they should
have the opportunity to be represented by the attorney of their
choice.
   The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court to reject the
two tribes' appeal. If the tribes ``did not want Lazarus to
represent them and to engage in ordinary activities on their behalf
such as agreeing to factual stipulations, they should have retained
separate counsel earlier,'' Justice Department lawyers said.
   The case is Oglala Sioux vs. U.S., 88-1380.

   A high school drill team instructor faces a
reprimand or dismissal after allegedly baring her breasts to female
students to demonstrate the results of augmentation surgery, the
principal said.
   ``We have taken appropriate action,'' said James King, principal
of Northbrook Senior High School. He said only that the school
district had made a recommendation to deal with complaints against
instructor Danette Arrington.
   But a Northbrook teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the drill team students were told Friday that Ms. Arrington
would not be returning to school.
   There was no immediate comment from Ms. Arrington; she has an
unlisted telephone number. She told the Houston Chronicle she would
have no comment.
   Ms. Arrington, who has instructed the drill team and taught
associated dance classes at Northbrook for two years, told
officials she had a valid reason for showing her breasts to three
classes of drill team students on May 8.
   Spring Branch Superintendent Hal Guthrie said Ms. Arrington
reportedly was explaining her breast augmentation surgery to her
class.
   ``She had a close relationship with the students and apparently
decided to discuss this with them,'' he said.
   ``You know how kids are,'' said the teacher who spoke
anonymously. ``They said she did it because they asked her to.''
   Guthrie said the district ``believes in strong communication
with our students, but the incident as described to me goes beyond
what the school district is willing to accept.''
   King said he had talked with drill team members and their
parents in checking out complaints.
   The teacher who spoke anonymously said many faculty members are
upset about the incident because they think it reflects poorly on
their profession.
   ``I just couldn't believe that she did that in a school
setting,'' she said.

   Thousands of Peronists danced in
the streets early today to celebrate Carlos Menem's election to the
presidency _ the return to power of the party of labor and the
working poor.
   Sunday's election marked Argentina's first transfer of power
between civilian governments in 61 years and capped a long comeback
for the populist Peronists, who had been banned for 25 of the past
34 years.
   With 90 percent of the vote counted, Menem received 7,206,916,
or 47.2 percent, to the 5,663,175, or 37 percent garnered by
Menem's strongest competitor, Eduardo Angeloz of the ruling Radical
Civic Union. There were 12 candidates in all.
   Those votes earned Menem 309 of the 600 Electoral College votes,
eight more than needed, according to projections by the independent
news agency, Diarios y Noticias.
   Angeloz, Menem's former law school classmate, conceded defeat.
   ``I've defeated an adversary, but I've regained a friend,''
Menem said.
   Menem, the charismatic 58-year-old governor of La Rioja
province, called for national unity immediately after declaring
victory.
   The campaign had been divisive and he must cope with a country
in economic decline and a restive military.
   ``I am not more capable than anyone else, but I'm not less
capable,'' Menem said. ``The important thing is to get the country
moving.''
   The Interior Ministry estimated that 82 percent of the 20
million eligible voters cast ballots.
   Voters also chose a vice president, half the members of the
Chamber of Deputies, one senator, legislatures in 14 of the
nation's 22 provinces and several thousand municipal officials.
   In Sunday elections, Peronists took 66 of the 127 seats at stake
in the National Chamber of Deputies and with 124 seats total,
Peronists were just four seats short of a majority, according to
Diarios y Noticias.
   The Peronists already control the biggest bloc in the Senate and
most provincial legislatures and governorships.
   The presidential inauguration was set for Dec. 10, the last day
of the six-year term of President Raul Alfonsin, who is barred by
the constitution from seeking re-election.
   Alfonsin took office in December 1983, ending a brutal military
dictatorship that lasted nearly eight years.
   Angeloz, 57, governor of Cordoba province, said he wished Menem
``all the luck possible ... I leave defeated but will continue
working in my province and later I'll see what I can do on the
national level.''
   Voting was calm and orderly in the South American nation of 31
million. Some polling stations opened late and some lacked ballots,
but there were no charges of fraud.
   Polls had predicted that the center-left Peronist Party would
win. Party supporters danced in the streets outside Menem's
campaign headquarters in Buenos Aires even before victory was
assured.
   Menem, who encourages people to call him ``Carlitos,'' is
extremely popular among the working class.
   Menem and Angeloz had offered different proposals for how
Argentina _ once one of the world's wealthiest nations _ might
overcome a chronic budget deficit, triple-digit inflation, high
unemployment and a $59 billion foreign debt.
   Menem pledged to dramatically improve wages and said he might
negotiate to suspend payments on the foreign debt.
   He has spoken vaguely of a ``productive revolution'' and
``social pact'' to spur employment, slash the budget deficit, raise
the value of the national currency and curtail inflation.
   Angeloz, the candidate of the middle class, pledged to sell
inefficient state industries, maintain a free exchange rate, spur
exports and diminish the power of the 4 million-strong General
Labor Confederation union, the cornerstone of the Peronist Party.
   Elements in the armed forces have staged three insurrections
against Alfonsin. Menem endorsed the concept of ``reconciliation''
but said he would not pardon officers convicted of human rights
abuses for their actions during the 1976-83 military dictatorship's
``dirty war'' on leftist subversion, or block pending trials of
other officers.
   The Peronist Party was founded by Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, who
came to power in 1946 and was ousted by a military coup in 1955.
The military banned the party and jailed or exiled many of its
leaders until 1973, when Peron returned from Spain and was elected
by an overwhelming margin.
   Following his death on July 1, 1974, his wife, Isabel, took over
as president. She was deposed by a coup in March 1976 and the
military rulers jailed Menem.

<TEXT>
   An Oklahoma couple sentenced to two years in
prison for their ill child's death because they relied on prayer
and divine intervention rather than seek medical care lost a
Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that Kevin
and Jamie Ann Funkhouser of Purcell, Okla., wrongly were convicted
of second-degree manslaughter.
   The Funkhousers' three-month-old son, Benjamin, died July 15,
1983 at home. He had been ill for about two weeks but his parents
did not seek medical attention for the boy.
   They are members of the Church of the First Born, which relies
on divine intervention for healing sickness to the exlusion of
medical assistance. Elders twice visited the sick child to pray for
him and anoint him with oil.
   The Funkhousers each were convicted and sentenced to two years
in prison. According to court records, they began serving the terms
last Dec. 28.
   Unlike previous similar appeals rejected by the nation's highest
court, the Funkhousers' appeal did not argue that their prosecution
and conviction violated religious freedom.
   The Funkhousers instead argued that they were denied a fair
trial and deprived of equal-protection and due-process rights
because they were charged with second-degree _ and not first-degree
_ manslaughter.
   Oddly enough, they had sought to be prosecuted for first-degree
manslaughter, a more serious crime. The reason: the availablity of
a key defense.
   Under Oklahoma law, a parent charged with first-degree
manslaughter cannot be convicted of failing to provide medical
treatment for a child ``if instead the parent in good faith selects
and depends on spiritual means alone through prayer.''
   But the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals ruled in the
Funkhousers' case that a parent charged with second-degree
manslaughter is justified in failing to provide medical care for a
child only if such religious reliance ``is something which a
reasonably careful person would do under similar circumstances and
conditions.''
   Lawyers for the Funkhousers said the instructions jurors
received _ containing the ``reasonably careful person'' wording not
included in first-degree manslaughter cases _ obliterated the
defense.
   The case is Funkhouser vs. Oklahoma, 88-1541.

   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
a Massachusetts newspaper barred from seeing a court document
during a much-publicized murder prosecution.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a state court decision
that keeping the document secret did not violate the public's
constitutional right of access in criminal trials. There was no
recorded dissent.
   Raymond Green, a supervisor at the Belchertown State School in
rural western Massachusetts, was murdered on the school campus Aug.
4, 1986. There was no arrest in the case for 11 months.
   Kenneth Phoenix, a school employee, was arrested July 3, 1987,
on murder charges. State police searched Phoenix's Belchertown home
that same day.
   After Phoenix was arraigned in court, but before he was formally
indicted, a reporter for the Transcript-Telegram, a newspaper
published by Newspapers of New England Inc. in Holyoke, Mass.,
asked to see the search warrant and supporting police affidavit.
   A state judge agreed to release the warrant that was issued
allowing police to search Phoenix's home. But she impounded the
16-page affidavit, in which police offered justification for the
search.
   A state appeals court upheld that order after the
Transcript-Telegram appealed, and the Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court ruled last Dec. 22 that the judge had acted properly.
   Although acknowledging the affidavit is a public document and
the public has a right to attend criminal trials, the state court
said: ``The affidavit in question has no integral relationship with
any particular pretrial proceeding to which the public enjoys a
First Amendment right of access.''
   The state court also said releasing the affidavit at the time
the newspaper sought it could have jeopardized Phoenix's right to a
fair trial.
   ``No constitutionally guaranteed right to access to the
affidavit existed at the time the plaintiff requested it, and the
district court judge did not abuse her discretion in impounding the
affidavit,'' the state court ruled.
   Noting that Phoenix already had been convicted by the time of
its ruling, the state Supreme Judicial Court ordered that the
affidavit be made public. It subsquently was released.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the newspaper said
release of the document did not make its constitutional challenge
moot.
   ``The dispute over the right to inspect affidavits in support of
search warrants is not only capable but likely of repetition,'' the
appeal said.
   It added: ``The decision in this action leaves the public with
no constitutionally guaranteed right of access to important
judicial proceedings.''
   But Massachusetts prosecutors urged the justices to reject the
appeal.
   ``Search warrant affidavits are generally available to the press
and the public,'' they said. ``Although occasions will continue to
arise where particular affidavits are temporarily impounded to
protect legitimate state interests _ the integrity of an ongoing
investigation or the accused's constitutional right to a fair trial
_ the general principal is one of publicity.''
   The case is Newspapers of New England vs. Clerk-Magistrate,
88-1514.

   Thousands of people marched in
southern Kwangju city today to protest the death of a dissident
student, rejecting claims by authorities that the man drowned.
   In Seoul, 300 radical student leaders began a four-day hunger
strike today to demand a full and independent investigation into
the death of the dissident student, Lee Chol-kyu. They claim police
tortured and killed Lee.
   Witnesses in Kwangju said scuffles erupted today when
protesters, yelling ``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo,'' tried to
force their way past police lines to the provincial government
headquarters.
   Riot police wielded shields and truncheons to disperse the
demonstrators, they said. No injuries or arrests were reported.
   The witnesses said they were among 10,000 demonstrators who
marched through downtown Kwangju for a third day of protest. Many
professors and other faculty members joined the rally, which
started at Chosun University, they said.
   Students in Seoul threatened to stage nationwide protests,
beginning Thursday, unless the circumstances of Lee's death are
fully explained.
   Dissidents and radical students accuse authorities of distorting
pathological tests.
   Doctors reported Sunday finding ``a lot of plankton'' in Lee's
intestines, which they said was indicative of drowning.
   ``The findings indisputably indicate that the student died by
drowning,'' said Yoon Joong-jin, director of the National Institute
of Scientific Investigation.
   Yoon said independent medical college professors and opposition
lawmakers witnessed the tests to ensure credibility. Doctors also
have said an autopsy showed no sign of torture.
   Opposition parties called today for a parliamentary inquiry to
dispel doubts about Lee's death.
   Hundreds of posters rejecting the autopsy results were plastered
on notice boards of buildings in Kwangju, the scene of a 1980 civil
uprising in which about 200 people were killed. The city marks the
anniversary of that uprising on Thursday.
   Thousands of Kwangju students and citizens have protested daily
since Lee's body was found Wednesday in a reservoir outside they
city. Lee had been sought by police for anti-government activities.
   Lee's death also comes as authorities step up a crackdown on
dissidents. About 230 radical students and dissidents have been
arrested since early April.
   Government officials say dissidents are trying to use Lee's
death as a rallying point for their anti-government campaign. South
Korean radicals, who want an end to the U.S. military presence in
South Korea and reunification with communist North Korea, enjoy
little public support because of their violent tactics and extreme
views.

<HEAD>Puerto Rico Officials Lose Supreme Court Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to free Puerto
Rico officials from paying $12.6 million to two companies involved
in an abandoned housing project in the island commonwealth.
   The court, without comment, turned down arguments by
commonwealth officials that the lawsuit against them should be
thrown out.
   Compania de Desarrollo Cooperativo (CDC), a public agency
created by the Puerto Rico government to help finance cooperative
projects, was ordered to pay the money to USI Properties Co. and MD
Construction Co.
   Under agreements in 1978, USI Properties sold land to MD
Construction for a housing project called Ciudad Cristiana. CDC
agreed to help finance the construction and to sell the houses to
individual buyers.
   After 480 of the proposed units were completed in 1982, CDC cut
off financing. The agency said the land was contaminated with
mercury, and commonwealth officials in 1985 ordered the area
evacuated.
   A federal jury ordered CDC to pay $1.2 million to USI Properties
and $11.4 million to MD Construction.
   The verdict followed a complex series of legal maneuvers in
which USI Properties sued both MD Construction and CDC in federal
court.
   The Puerto Rico agency said USI Properties should not have been
allowed to sue MD Construction in federal court because the two
companies were in fact ``partners in litigation'' on the same side
of the dispute.
   USI Properties was allowed to sue MD Construction in federal
court _ rather than in commonwealth court in Puerto Rico _ on
grounds the two companies were incorporated or had main offices in
different jurisdictions.
   CDC argued that USI Properties' main place of business is Puerto
Rico. But a federal judge ruled that the company's main office is
in New York because it has administrative offices there.
   Therefore, the federal judge said USI Properties could sue MD
Construction, based in Puerto Rico, in federal court rather than in
Puerto Rico's commonwealth court.
   The judge also rejected charges that USI Properties and MD
Construction were in collusion in the lawsuit. The 1st U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last October.
   The case is Compania de Dessarrollo Cooperativo vs. USI
Properties, 88-1428.

   The Energy Department conducted a
nuclear weapons test under the desert at the Nevada Test Site
shortly after dawn today and pronounced it a success.
   The shot had an explosive yield of less than 20 kilotons,
placing it in the lower range of tests conducted at the remote
desert site, Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer said. All tests
are listed as having an explosive force of less than 20 kilotons,
or 20 to 150 kilotons.
   The test, code-named Palisade and conducted at 6:10 a.m., was
``very successful, with no problems,'' Boyer said.
   The nuclear device was buried 1,100 feet beneath the surface of
Yucca Flat, about 85 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   A subsidence was reported at 6:59 a.m., indicating the ground
had caved in at the point of detonation and sealed any radioactive
gases in the earth.
   Palisade was the fourth announced test this year and the 691st
announced shot at the site since testing began in Nevada in January
of 1951.
   The last previous test was Ingot, on March 9. Twelve tests were
announced last year.

   The Supreme Court today rejected a Bush
administration appeal aimed at giving the government more power to
control rents for federally subsidized housing.
   The court, without comment, refused to review a decision
favoring landlords in Washington state.
   At issue is an interpretation of the housing subsidy law adopted
by former President Reagan's administration in 1981. The law
provides subsidies for those people who cannot afford to pay the
full amount of their rent.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1981 said the
government could control rents by requiring local surveys of what
landlords were being paid for non-subsidized, comparable housing.
   The surveys were to substitute in some cases for a system of
rent increases pegged to an inflation formula adopted in 1974 for
subsidized housing.
   The substitution of the market survey approach was challenged in
a federal lawsuit in 1983 by Rainier View Associates, owners of
subsidized housing in Bremerton, Wash.
   HUD officials said Rainier View must conduct a study of housing
in the vicinity to support its bid for higher rents.
   Rainier View said it was entitled to an inflation-based hike
geared to its rising costs. The landlord said the government was
reneging on a 20-year contract it signed with Rainier View in 1980
guaranteeing that rents would keep pace with rising costs.
   A federal judge ruled in favor of HUD, but the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed the decision last June.
   Federal law ``does not permit HUD to abandon entirely the
formula method it chose and to adjust rents solely on the basis of
a market survey,'' the appeals court said.
   Administration lawyers said the ruling could mean an additional
$50 million in subsidies in states within the 9th Circuit court's
jurisdiction: Arizona, Alaska, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana,
Nevada, Oregon and Washington.
   If the appeals court ruling were adopted nationwide, the cost
would be more than $200 million, the government's appeal said.
   The additional subsidies will have to be paid for by taxpayers
or by trimming other aspects of the housing subsidy program, the
government lawyers said.
   Lawyers for Rainier View Associates and another Washington
housing developer, Mayer Built Homes, accused the government of a
``hypocritical'' attack on the subsidy program.
   ``Saving money is commendable, but not at the expense of
contractual rights and of the larger view of the public interest,''
the landlords' lawyers said.
   Cutting subsidies will prompt developers to desert the program,
they said, adding, ``The depletion of our already small inventory
of housing for the elderly, the handicapped and the disadvantaged
cannot be in the public interest.''
   The case is U.S. vs. Rainier View Associates, 88-1515.

   A U.S. hydrogen bomb was crushed by sea pressure
when it fell into the Pacific Ocean off Japan 24 years ago and its
nuclear material has dissolved harmlessly on the sea floor, the
United States has told Japan.
   The material poses no environmental hazard, the U.S. Defense
Department said in a report given to the Japanese Embassy in
Washington on Friday.
   A copy was given to The Associated Press today after Cabinet
members said Japan would check for possible environmental dangers.
   The Foreign Ministry later formed a team to evaluate the U.S.
report and decide whether more studies are needed. The experts come
from the Defense Agency, the coast guard, the Environmental Agency
and the fisheries authority.
   The only country ever attacked with nuclear weapons, Japan is
sensitive to the nuclear issue. Since the 1965 accident was
disclosed last week, several demonstrations have been held and
opposition members of Parliament have pressed the government to get
a full explanation from Washington.
   Japan also still was asking whether the aircraft carrier
Ticonderoga had been sailing to a Japanese port when one of its A-4
Skyhawks accidentally fell into the sea while carrying the
one-megaton bomb.
   This country bans nuclear weapons from its territory but is
thought to look the other way in the case of port calls by U.S.
vessels likely to be carrying nuclear bombs. The Navy does not
comment on whether its ships carry nuclear weapons.
   Japan asked the United States for an explanation last week after
details of the 1965 accident were disclosed in Washington by
William Arkin, a researcher for the liberal Institute of Policy
Studies.
   Arkin said the B-43 bomb was not in danger of exploding but its
33 pounds of plutonium could threaten the environment as the
structure of the bomb deteriorated.
   The Defense Department report said the bomb was not built to
withstand the tremendous pressure of the 16,000-foot depths in
which it sank and its nuclear materials had leaked into the sea.
   The high explosives that would trigger a nuclear blast also
would have been gradually neutralized by exposure to water, the
report said.
   ``This action will assure that no nuclear or high explosive
detonation can ever occur in the environment now or in the
future,'' it said.
   Nuclear weapons specialists at the U.S. National Laboratory had
tested the unspecified type of nuclear material by dissolving it in
sea water, the report said.
   ``These tests show that the material will dissolve in a
relatively short time. Because of its high density, the solute
would have settled very quickly to the floor of the ocean along
with other sedimentation. Therefore, there is no environmental
impact,'' it said.
   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno, responding in Parliament to
opposition questions on the incident, said Japan accepted the
American report saying there was no environmental danger.
   ``But I think it necessary to have experts from the concerned
ministries consider the pertinent issues'' such as environmental
pollution, Uno said.
   He and Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi both said the
question of whether the Ticonderoga had docked in Japan was still
unanswered.
   ``We consider the U.S. side gave a trustworthy explanation of
the U.S. evaluation of the incident,'' Obuchi told a news
conference.
   Asked whether the ship had gone on to dock at the Japanese port
of Yokusuka, Obuchi replied, ``We have no confirmation at present
but we are inquiring now.''
   On Saturday, about 500 people demonstrated in Tokyo calling for
the elimination of nuclear arms and for an end to the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty, under which about 60,000 U.S. troops are based in
Japan.
   The treaty calls for consultations between the two countries if
nuclear weapons are introduced into Japan, and since there has been
no U.S. request for such consultations, the Japanese government has
always said it believes the United States is complying with Japan's
anti-nuclear policy.
   In 1981, the United States described the accident as one of the
two most serious ever involving U.S. nuclear devices _ the other
was the loss of the submarine Thresher in the Atlantic in 1968 _
but implied it occurred 500 miles from land.
   In fact, the bomb sank about 80 miles off an inhabited island in
Okinawa prefecture in far southern Japan.

   A West German relief worker reportedly
kidnapped 10 days ago has turned up safely but he declined to give
details of his ordeal.
   West German Markus Quint surfaced Sunday and spoke with
reporters in southern Zahrani. He was accompanied by Nabih Berri,
head of the Shiite Moslem militia Amal, who reportedly helped free
Quint.
   ``I thank the minister and I thank the Amal movement a lot for
releasing me,'' said the clean-shaven Quint.
   When asked who his kidnappers were, Quint replied, ``I'm tired.''
   Berri also refused to tell who Quint's kidnappers were, saying
he did not want to endanger the lives of the West German or two
others kidnapped with him on May 4. He said no ransom was paid.
   ``I did not meet the kidnappers. Many contacts were made and, of
course, we exerted a lot of pressure and carried out raids,'' Berri
said. He did not elaborate.
   Amal, backed by Syria, controls much of southern Lebanon.
   Quint said he was treated well. ``They did not hurt me. They
were very good with me and I didn't face any problems with food.''
   No group claimed responsibility for kidnapping Quint when he
disappeared But Palestinian guerrillas said he was being held in
connection with the trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite
Moslem hijacker on trial in West Germany.
   Quint disappeared along with colleagues Heinrich Struebig, 48,
and Petra Schnitzler, 26 also of the ASME-Humanitas relief group,
which has its headquarters in Zahrani. The two reappeared 10 hours
later.
   Palestinian security officials in south Lebanon said Quint's
colleagues told them kidnappers wanted a mild sentence for Hamadi,
who is on trial for a 1985 TWA hijacking in which an American died.
A verdict is due Wednesday.
   Police, meanwhile, were searching for Briton Jack Mann, who
disappeared Friday in Beirut. Detectives found Mann's car in west
Beirut but said they had no clues to his whereabouts.
   A group calling itself The Cells of Armed Struggle claimed
Friday it took a hostage, but it did not identify the person. It
demanded the release of ``comrades'' jailed in Britain in the 1987
killing of a Palestinian political cartoonist.
   Scotland Yard says there have been no arrests in the 1987 case.
   There are 15 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon, including nine
Americans. Held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>Court Says Brutality Victims Need Only Prove Police Acted Unreasonably</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that people who
sue over alleged police brutality must prove only that the officers
involved acted unreasonably, not ``maliciously and sadistically.''
   The court unanimously reinstated a Charlotte, N.C., man's
allegations that he was the victim of excessive force by five city
police officers in a 1984 incident.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrongly dismissed Dethorn
Graham's civil rights suit after finding that he had failed to
prove the police acted maliciously and sadistically.
   Under a 1973 Supreme Court decision, that standard of proof is
required for prison inmates suing officials over alleged physical
abuse.
   But Rehnquist said a different standard applies ``in the context
of an arrest or investigatory stop of a free citizen.''
   Such incidents, the high court said today, should be judged with
a focus on the Fourth Amendment's requirement that police conduct
be reasonable.
   Most other federal appeals courts already had adopted the
``reasonableness'' standard for cases such as Graham's, but the 4th
Circuit court's ruling _ until today _ had set a different
precedent for Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia
and West Virginia.
   Graham, a diabetic, sued Charlotte and five police officers over
a Nov. 12, 1984 incident near his home.
   Graham's lawsuit said he was at home working on an automobile
when he felt a diabetic reaction, caused by a reduced level of
sugar in his blood, coming on.
   The suit said Graham had a friend drive him to a nearby store,
and then rushed in to pick up some orange juice to supplement his
blood sugar.
   Graham rushed out of the store without waiting in a long
check-out line, and asked his friend to drive him to another
friend's house, according to court documents.
   A police officer who saw Graham enter and leave the store
pursued the car and pulled it over.
   Graham's lawsuit said that in the ensuing minutes Graham was
treated so roughly by the five police officers that his foot was
broken, his wrists cut by handcuffs and his face hurt.
   A federal judge threw out the suit, and the 4th Circuit court
upheld the dismissal.
   The Supreme Court today returned Graham's case to the appeals
court, with instructions to restudy it under the less stringent
``reasonableness'' standard of proof.
   ``We reject this notion that all excessive force claims brought
under (federal civil rights law) are governed by a single generic
standard,'' Rehnquist wrote in reversing the 4th Circuit court's
ruling.
   ``In addressing an excessive force claim ... analysis begins by
identifying the specific constitutional right allegeldy infringed
by the challenged application of force,'' he said.
   Most times, Rehnquist said, the constitutional right will be the
Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable search and seizure or, in
the prison and jail context, the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel
and unusual punishment.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall agreed with most of Rehnquist's opinion, but objected to
the court's ruling that all excessive-force suits growing out of
arrests and investigatory stops must be scrutinized under a Fourth
Amendment analysis.
   Writing for the three, Blackmun said the court should not have
gone as far as to say that ``a substantive due process standard''
never should be used in such cases.
   The five officers named in Graham's suit were identified in
court records as M.S. Connor, R.B. Townes, T. Rice, Hilda P. Matos
and M.M. Chandler.
   The case is Graham vs. Connor, 87-6571.

   A school bus driver and at least 16 students
were injured today in an accident, one year and a day after a
church bus crash killed 27 people near another Ohio River community.
   The school bus smashed into a large walnut tree at the bottom of
a hill, apparently after a brake failure, witnesses said.
   The driver and 11 children were being treated at Booth Memorial
Hospital in Florence, a hospital spokeswoman said. The driver was
in fair condition with chest and abdominal injuries, and the
children suffered minor injuries.
   Five children were treated for minor injuries and released from
Carroll County Memorial Hospital, said hospital administrator Roger
Williams. The bus carried both elementary and high school students.
   The accident was about 20 miles from the site of the fatal crash
near Carrollton involving members of a Radcliff church, who were
killed when their bus was struck by a truck. The driver of the
pickup, Larry W. Mahoney, faces trial in November on 27 counts of
murder and one count of drunken-driving.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter today
named Keith D. Bjerke, a Northwood, N.D., farmer, to head the
Agriculture Department's main agency dealing with farm commodity
programs.
   Bjerke, 49, will be the administrator of the department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which oversees
a nationwide network of state and county offices. The agency
handles federal price support programs for major crops and dairy.
   Yeutter said Bjerke brings to USDA ``far-reaching experience as
a production farmer, considerable expertise in the international
agricultural arena, and demonstrate dedication and service to his
community and state.''
   Bjerke, whose salary will be $78,600 a year, since 1964 has
owned and operated a 3,500-acre farm producing wheat, malting
barley, soybeans, dry edible beans, corn, alfalfa and hogs.
   In 1987-88, he was hog procurement and production consultant for
Cloverdale Foods Inc., Mandan, N.D. For the last five years he has
been on the board of directors of Pioneer Mutual Life Insurance
Co., Fargo., and has served on the board of the 9th Federal Reserve
Bank, Minneapolis, and the board of the Minneapolis Grain Exchange.
   Bjerke also has been a delegate to the U.S.-European Economic
Community Conference on Agriculture.

<HEAD>Soviet Troops Begin Withdrawing from Mongolia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trains loaded with tanks and missile systems began
leaving Mongolia today in the second stage of a partial withdrawal
of Soviet troops, officials said.
   It coincided with the first day of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's visit to China to improve relations at the first
Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   Soviet troops were sent to patrol the Mongolian border with
China in the mid-1960s when relations between the communist rivals
broke down.
   ``Now we don`t have such conditions,'' a Defense Ministry
spokesman said at a news briefing.
   Over the next two years, about 50,000 troops will be withdrawn,
about 75 percent of the force deployed in Mongolia, Maj. Gen. Yuri
Markelov said.
   Their withdrawal is part of an overall reduction of 500,000
Soviet troops promised by Gorbachev at the United Nations last
December.
   ``About 50,000 servicemen, 5,000 tanks, 1,000 infantry vehicles,
190 aircraft and 130 helicopter gunships will be withdrawn from
Mongolia,'' Markelov said.
   Tass said more than 820 artillery systems will be dismantled.
   It said the pullout ``has been brought about by new political
thinking and better relations in the region.''
   Last year, an infantry division was withdrawn from Mongolia,
Markelov said. This year, a tank division and other military units
will be pulled out and next year, one infantry division and one
tank division will be recalled, he said.
   ``The troops were stationed in Mongolia at the request of the
government and the withdrawal is also at the request of the
Mongolian government,'' he said. ``Mongolia is a sovereign country
and can determine itself the degree of security that is needed.''
   Markelov said there was one serious clash between Soviet and
Chinese troops in 1969 and several minor incidents, but he said he
did not have exact data or casualty figures.
   The officer said it was coincidental that the withdrawal was
taking place as Gorbachev visited China.
   The Soviet Union began withdrawing troops from Hungary on April
25 and cuts are expected to begin shortly in East Germany and
Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Gives Prison Officials Right to Limit Prisoners Reading
Matter, Visitors</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: This sty includes material from other cases and will stand for

<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today gave prison officials
sweeping power to limit what inmates may read and who may visit
them.
   Voting 6-3 in a case from Kentucky, the justices said officials
are not required to explain why they bar an inmate from having
visitors.
   The court rejected arguments that the state, by establishing a
system permitting visits, endowed inmates with a new right to see
outsiders. Prisoners do not have a right in such cases to ``due
process'' _ for example, a hearing or an explanation _ when they
are denied a visit by someone, the court said.
   By the same 6-3 split, the justices overturned a ruling by a
federal appeals court here that limited authority of officials to
censor reading material behind bars.
   ``Where the regulations at issue concern the entry of materials
into the prison...a regulation which gives prison authorities broad
discretion is appropriate,'' said Justice Harry A. Blackmun for the
court.
   Blackmun said regulations must be upheld as long as they are
``reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.''
   The court upheld the power of wardens to ban any publication at
federal prisons they believe is ``detrimental to the security, good
order or discipline of the institution or...might facilitate
criminal activity.''
   In other actions today the court:
   _Ruled that people who sue over alleged police brutality must
prove only that the officers involved acted unreasonably, not
``maliciously and sadistically.'' The court unanimously reinstated
a Charlotte, N.C., man's allegations that he was the victim of
excessive force by five city police officers in a 1984 incident.
   _Agreed to review a ruling that makes it easier for disabled
children to win some federal welfare benefits.
   _Refused to hear an appeal by two Sioux Indian tribes seeking
land they surrendered to the federal government 121 years ago. The
court, without comment, rejected arguments that the tribes were
forced illegally in 1987 to accept financial compensation for the
land given up in 1868. The tribes contend that the 1987 settlement
was agreed to by a lawyer who no longer represented them.
   Among the prisoners who challenged the publications rule is Jack
Henry Abbott, a convicted murderer and bank robber who achieved
notoriety after he was befriended by Norman Mailer and other
prominent writers and editors.
   Six weeks after Abbott was freed in a work-release program in
1981 he stabbed to death an aspiring actor outside a New York City
restaurant where the victim was working as a waiter.
   Abbott's book on prison life, ``In the Belly of the Beast,'' was
critically acclaimed.
   The Supreme Court today ordered further hearings to determine
whether prisoners should be allowed to read any of 46 publications
officials want to ban.
   But the justices said the officials do not have the burden of
proving any of the publications threaten security, order or
rehabiliation at the prison.
   Among the publications on the list, for example, was an issue of
The Call, a left-wing newspaper that included an article charging
``inhumane treatment ...by racist guards'' in federal prisons.
   Today's ruling is a victory for the Justice Department, which
urged the high court to overturn a ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals here.
   Department officials cited uprisings in 1987 by inmates from
Cuba in two U.S. prisons as evidence that information from the
outside can have ``grave consequences'' in a prison.
   The government said that between Sept. 1, 1986, and Aug. 31,
1987, some 1,700 publications were withheld out of 1.8 million sent
to federal inmates.
   In the Kentucky prison visits case, the justices overturned a
ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Most states joined in urging reversal of the appeals court
ruling. State officials said numerous regulations, ranging from job
assignments to telephone privileges, could be jeopardized if the
court restrained the power of officials to regulate outside visits.
   The Kentucky case arose from a lawsuit by inmates at a state
reformatory in LaGrange.
   The state settled the suit by agreeing in 1980 to continue an
``open visitation policy'' at the prison.
   In 1985, an inmate's mother was denied the right to visit him
because she had brought to the prison with her a man previously
barred for smuggling contraband. There were other similar instances
as well.
   Today's rulings were in line with several recent high court
decisions that buttress the power of prison officials to enforce
various rules. For example, the court in 1987 upheld a rule that
prohibits correspondence between inmates in different prisons.
   In both rulings today, Blackmun was joined by Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Dissenting were Justices Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan
and John Paul Stevens.
   In a third case involving prisoners' rights, the court
unanimously permitted a prison inmate to challenge in federal court
a 1958 Washington state court robbery conviction for which the
sentence has expired.
   The high court, in an unsigned opinion, said federal courts have
authority to decide whether Mark Edwin Cook's 30-year-old
conviction was used unfairly to stiffen prison sentences he
received for more recent crimes.
   The cases are Thornburgh vs. Abbott, 87-1344; Kentucky vs.
Thompson, 87-1815; Maleng vs. Cook, 88-357.

   An explosion and fire killed two sailors on
the 24-year-old aircraft carrier USS America in the third deadly
blaze on a U.S. warship in 25 days.
   One of the two killed Saturday night may have died while looking

   The latest deaths occurred in a pump room for jet fuel as the
Norfolk-based carrier cruised hundreds of miles off North Carolina,
said Lt. Cmdr. Mike John, a Navy spokesman.
   Firefighters on the vessel extinguished the blaze with no
additional casualties, the Atlantic Fleet said in a statement.
   A team of about 10 Navy investigators, including structural and
fuel experts, left this morning to fly to the America to assess
damage and determine the cause of the explosion, John said.
   Neither John nor Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, another Navy
spokesman, would speculate on possible causes of the blast, but
they said the oil-fueled carrier would continue its mission, a
six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean. The
1,047-foot-long America, which was commissioned in 1965, left
Norfolk on Thursday with a crew of about 5,000.
   ``At this time, we see no reason to cut the mission short,''
John said. ``The vessel is able to continue.''
   Burnett said he was uncertain how the carrier's air operations
might be affected by the damage.
   John said the investigators would determine whether to repair
the vessel during its deployment or wait until it returns to port.
   An April 19 explosion and fire in a gun turret killed 47 sailors
aboard the Norfolk-based battleship USS Iowa off Puerto Rico. On
May 9, six sailors died in an engine room fire on the supply ship
USS White Plains in the South China Sea.
   Six flag-draped coffins containing the bodies of the White
Plains sailors arrived Sunday at Alameda Naval Air Station, Calif.
   It is highly unusual for the Navy to have three fatal shipboard
fires in less than a month, said Navy Lt. Paul Jenkins. But, the
spokesman added, ``there's no evidence to link these three isolated
incidents. The Navy's overall safety record is superb.''
   Burnett said he was uncertain how often shipboard fires occur on
an average basis.
   Killed Saturday were Petty Officer 3rd Class Richard E.
Childress, 22, of Ham Lake, Minn., and Airman Recruit Larry J.
Brunson, 19, of Akron, Ohio.
   Burnett said the bodies were flown back to Norfolk on Sunday and
transported to Portsmouth Naval Hospital.
   Jenkins said Childress and Brunson apparently were working in
the fuel pump room when the explosion occurred.
   Childress' stepfather, Timothy Holleman, said Navy officials
told the family that Childress and Brunson apparently noticed a
fuel leak while working the fire watch in a pump room, part of the
miles of pipes on the aircraft carrier through which jet fuel is
circulated.
   Childress apparently notified the bridge of the problem and was
returning to the room when the explosion occurred, Holleman said.
Officials told the family that Brunson might have died in the
explosion and that Childress might have subsequently died going
back into the room, possibly to look for Brunson.
   Brunson's aunt, Anne Brunson of Akron, said her nephew ``was
really proud to be in the service.'' She said he always wanted to
be a pilot and enlisted immediately after graduating from Akron
Buchtel High School.
   Larry Weigle, a former assistant principal at Buchtel, called
Brunson ``a real pleasant, nice kid. If there's one thing you could
say about Larry, he always had a smile on his face.''
   Childress' mother, Myrna Holleman, was in Seattle celebrating
her 15th wedding anniversary with Holleman when they were notified
of her son's death.
   ``It's the phone call that every parent dreads. The call in the
night,'' she said after returning home to Ham Lake.
   Childress' stepgrandfather, Aike Holleman, said Childress joined
the Navy shortly after graduating from high school in 1985.
   ``He was going to take advantage of the GI Bill and go to
college when he got out of the Navy, which was to be up in a year
from September,'' Holleman said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, in brief, are the highlghts of Monday's
actions by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   
   PRISONER RIGHTS
   
   The court gave prison officials sweeping power to limit what
inmates may read and who may visit them.
   Voting 6-3 in a case from Kentucky, the justices said officials
are not required to explain why they bar an inmate from having
visitors.
   The court rejected arguments that the state, by establishing a
system permitting visits, endowed inmates with a new right to see
outsiders. Prisoners do not have a right in such cases to ``due
process'' _ for example, a hearing or an explanation _ when they
are denied a visit by someone, the court said.
   By the same 6-3 split, the justices overturned a ruling by a
federal appeals court here that limited authority of officials to
censor reading material behind bars.
   ``Where the regulations at issue concern the entry of materials
into the prison...a regulation which gives prison authorities broad
discretion is appropriate,'' said Justice Harry A. Blackmun for the
court.
   The cases are Thornburgh vs. Abbott, 87-1344; Kentucky vs.
Thompson, 87-1815; Maleng vs. Cook, 88-357.
   
   POLICE BRUTALITY
   
   The court ruled that people who sue over alleged police
brutality must prove only that the officers involved acted
unreasonably, not ``maliciously and sadistically.''
   The court unanimously reinstated a Charlotte, N.C., man's
allegations that he was the victim of excessive force by five city
police officers in a 1984 incident.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrongly dismissed Dethorn
Graham's civil rights suit after finding that he had failed to
prove the police acted maliciously and sadistically.
   The case is Graham vs. Connor, 87-6571.
   
   DISABLED
   
   The court agreed to review a ruling that makes it easier for
disabled children to win some federal welfare benefits.
   The justices said they will hear a Bush administration appeal
aimed at overturning a ruling that could force the government to
re-evaluate benefits for more than 250,000 children.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last August ruled in favor
of disabled children seeking so-called supplemental security income
from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The
benefits are provided to the disabled of all ages.
   The circuit court said definitions of disability were being
interpreted by HHS in a way that illegally made it more difficult
for children to qualify.
   The case is Sullivan vs. Zebley, 88-1377.
   
   INDIAN CLAIMS
   
   The court refused to hear an appeal by two Sioux Indian tribes
seeking land they surrendered to the federal government 121 years
ago.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the tribes
were forced illegally in 1987 to accept financial compensation for
the land given up in 1868. The tribes contend that the 1987
settlement was agreed to by a lawyer who no longer represented them.
   The case is Oglala Sioux vs. U.S., 88-1380.
   
   RENT CONTROL
   
   The court rejected a Bush admnistration appeal aimed at giving
the government more power to control rents for federally subsidized
housing. The court, without comment, refused to review a decision
favoring landlords in Washington state.
   At issue is an interpretation of the housing subsidy law adopted
by former President Reagan's administration in 1981. The law
provides subsidies for those people who cannot afford to pay the
full amount of their rent.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1981
said the government could control rents by requiring local surveys
of what landlords were being paid for non-subsidized, comparable
housing. The market survey approach was challenged in a federal
lawsuit in 1983 by Rainier View Associates, owners of subsidized
housing in Bremerton, Wash.
   Rainier View said it was entitled to an inflation-based hike
geared to its rising costs.
   The case is U.S. vs. Rainier View Associates, 88-1515.

<HEAD>Trial Starts For Former Klansman Charged In Slaying Of Black Teen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Ku Klux Klansman went on trial
today charged with being an accomplice in the killing of a black
teen-ager, for which the defendant's brother-in-law is on death row.
   The murder trial for Benjamin Franklin Cox, 27, began this
morning with the judge reviewing attorneys' motions. Jury selection
was scheduled to follow.
   The trial is Cox's second in the March 21, 1981, beating death
of Michael Donald, whose body was left hanging in a tree. Cox faces
up to life in prison.
   Cox's brother-in-law, Henry Francis Hays, was convicted of
murder in the case in 1983 and sentenced to die in Alabama's
electric chair. He is on death row at Holman Prison.
   Donald, 19, was abducted at random from a Mobile street as part
of a Klan conspiracy.
   His murder led to a $7 million civil lawsuit verdict last year
against the nation's oldest Klan group _ the United Klans of
America. The group turned over its headquarters building in
Tuscaloosa to Donald's mother, Beulah Mae Donald, who sold the
building before she died.
   Cox and Hays' father, Bennie Jack Hays, went on trial together
in February 1988 on murder charges stemming from the slaying, but
the elder Hays collapsed in court, prompting a mistrial. This time,
the two are being tried separately.
   In the trial last year, the main proecution witness was James L.
``Tiger'' Knowles, who received a life prison sentence after he
pleaded guilty in 1983 to a federal charge of violating Donald's
civil rights.
   Knowles testified that Cox provided the rope used to hang
Donald. He also testified that a Klan superior, Bennie Jack Hays,
ordered the killing as revenge for the mistrial of a black man who
was charged in the slaying of a white police officer in Birmingham.
   Knowles told how he and Henry Hays, 33, abducted Donald and then
beat him, bound him and put him in the trunk of a car. Donald's
body was found hanging in a tree in a residential neighborhood.

<TEXT>
   A 39-year-old economist Monday
became the youngest president in Yugoslavia's history, taking over
as head of a collective presidency that faces unprecedented
economic woes and ethnic tensions.
   Janez Drnovsek, a virtually unknown lawmaker from northern
Slovenia, won 56 percent of votes in his republic in a watershed
ballot in April that gave Yugoslavia its first directly elected
president.
   Previously, presidents were chosen by regional parliaments and
just one candidate was put forth by Communist authorities.
   Under the country's rotating presidency, introduced in 1974, the
country's six republics and two autonomous provinces take turns
every year filling the top post. This time the highest office went
to Slovenia.
   Drnovsek replaces Raif Dizdarevic, who is retiring from
political life.
   ``We will strive to improve Yugoslavia's relations with
developed nations, particularly with Europe,'' Drnovsek said in his
inaugural speech today.
   He delivered his address in the Slovene language, rather than
Serbo-Croat, spoken by most Yugoslavs and normally used in
political speeches.
   In a speech recently, Drnovsek, who worked in industry and
banking, declared that democratization ``has begun and cannot be
halted.''
   He said he would push for further reforms at a time Yugslvia
faces mounting pressure for the introduction of a multi-party
system and closer ties with the West. Ethnic minorities are
clamoring for greater autonomy.
   He also faces serious economic problems. Unemployment is at 15
percent, living standards have plunged by one third in the past
decade and inflation surpassed 500 percent this month.
   Slovenia's multi-candidate elections were a first for a Yugoslav
republic. But similar ballots were later held in the republic of
montenegro and other republics were expected to follow suit later
this year.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Says Civil Fines and Criminal Penalties May Be Double
Jeopardy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil fines heaped on top of criminal
penalties sometimes may be a form of unconstitutional double
jeopardy, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today.
   The justices said such was the case when the manager of a New
York City medical laboratory was hit with $131,170 in civil fines
for defrauding the federal government of $585 on Medicare bills.
   The Constitution protects people against being tried twice for
the same crime and against multiple punishments for the same crime.
   But before today, the nation's highest court had never said
specifically that a civil fine may amount to ``punishment'' for
purposes of double-jeopardy analysis.
   Writing for the court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said, ``A civil
sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial
purpose, but rather can be explained only as also serving either
retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment.''
   Blackmun added: ``A defendant who already has been punished in a
criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil
sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be
characterized as remedial, but only as a deterent or retribution.''
   The justices sent back to a federal judge in New York City the
case of Irwin Halper, who runs the New City Medical Laboratories.
   Halper was convicted in a criminal prosecution of submitting
inflated claims for Medicare reimbursement. He was sentenced to two
years in prison and fined $5,000.
   Government officials then also sued Halper under the False
Claims Act, a law enacted during the Civil War to combat fraud
against the Union army by defense contractors.
   In that civil _ or non-criminal _ case, Halper was fined
$131,170. The fine was based on an assessment of $2,000 for each of
65 separate charges of overbilling, plus $1,170 for twice the
actual loss suffered by the government.
   The government said Halper billed Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Greater New York for $12 per patient for a service that Medicare
reimbursed at $3.
   U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet originally reduced the civil
fine against Halper to $17,170 and subsequently cut it to $1,170
when the government protested the first reduction.
   In today's decision, Blackmun agreed with Sweet that the civil
fines amounted to punishment.
   Although most civil fines for defrauding the government do not
rise to the level of punishment, Blackmun said, ``in a particular
case a civil penalty ... may be so divorced from the government's
damages and expenses as to constitute punishment.''
   Blackmun said it would be up to Judge Sweet ``to determine the
size of the civil sanction the government may receive without
crossing the line between remedy and punishment.''
   The justice said the government should be given a chance to make
an accounting of its damages and costs.
   ``What we announce now is a rule for the rare case,'' Blackmun
said, ``the case such as the one before us where a fixed-penalty
provision subjects a prolific but small-gauge offender to a
sanction overwhelmingly disproportionate to the damages he has
caused.''
   The case is U.S. vs. Halper, 87-1383.

   On the first day of a historic summit disrupted
by student protests, Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that the
Soviet Union must share the blame for a cold war that divided the
two countries for three decades.
   ``Very probably we are also responsible for that period to a
certain extent,'' the Soviet leader told China's President Yang
Shangkun.
   China's leaders moved the welcoming ceremony to the airport from
a central Beijing square to avoid a confrontation with tens of
thousands of rebellious students camped out on the plaza for a
third day.
   In remarks broadcast on Chinese television, Gorbachev expressed
``sorrow and regret'' for the bad blood of the past and said ``this
period has come to an end.''
   Gorbachev, 58, arrived today for the first Sino-Soviet summit
since Nikita Khrushchev met Mao Tse-tung in 1959 in acrimonious
talks that contributed to rapidly deteriorating relations.
   The two nations nearly went to war after border fighting broke
out in 1969, and have since been at odds over the Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan, Moscow's backing of Vietnam's
involvement in Cambodia and what China has called Soviet
``hegemonism.''
   Both sides agree that Gorbachev's meeting Tuesday with
84-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping will normalize government
and party ties and help spur economic, cultural and academic
contacts.
   ``The way towards this meeting was not an easy one,'' Gorbachev
said at a later banquet speech. ``It required from both sides
wisdom, responsibility and perseverance in removing the negative
aggravations and prejudices that marred our relations for so many
years.''
   Gorbachev also stressed that ``the improvement of Soviet-Chinese
relations is not directed against any third country. In the final
analysis, the entire world community stands to gain from that
improvement.''
   The United States, which in the past has benefited strategically
from the Sino-Soviet split, has welcomed their rapprochement,
saying it will contribute to stability in the region and world.
   But the summit got off to a rocky start as up to 150,000 people,
half of them students, occupied Tiananmen Square _ China's symbolic
seat of power _ in a massive protest for a more open and democratic
society.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, in a
briefing, the demonstrations would disrupt plans for Gorbachev to
lay a wreath on a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center of
the square Tuesday.
   ``Physically it's impossible. The place is taken up by
demonstrators,'' he said.
   Gerasimov said the Soviet side understood China's difficulties
in coping with the students. ``We have similar experiences and have
lived through some difficult times,'' he said.
   The demonstrators, including about 2,000 students in the third
day of a hunger strike, defied police orders to vacate the square,
forcing authorities to cancel a planned welcoming ceremony outside
the Great Hall of the People next to the square.
   Student leaders on Saturday delivered a letter containing 6,000
signatures to the Soviet Embassy requesting that Gorbachev address
students.
   Gorbachev's motorcade route from the airport, which was to have
passed by the square, also had to be changed when thousands of
people surged past police lines and spilled out onto the six-lane
street in front of the Forbidden City.
   Gorbachev's meeting with Yang was also set back by almost two
hours because of the change in the welcoming ceremony site. It took
place in the Great Hall next to the square, but it was unclear
whether Gorbachev saw the demonstrators.
   Soviet spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov shrugged off the schedule
changes, saying they ``were made upon the proposal of the Chinese
side. We are only guests here.''
   Asked if the visit was being overshadowed by the student
protests, he said the summit ``is incomparable and a much more
important event than actions taken by students.''
   He noted that ``each country has its own internal problems'' and
the Soviet Union has its share.
   The month of pro-democracy sit-ins, marches and other student
protests are the largest and most serious China's Communist leaders
have ever faced.
   Gorbachev laughed and joked with Yang during in the first
minutes of their meeting. The 81-year-old Yang, who like many older
Chinese studied Russian in his youth when the Kremlin was Beijing's
ideological mentor, greeted the Soviet leader in Russian and was
praised for his skill in the language.
   Later, in a welcoming banquet in the Great Hall, Yang noted that
``Sino-Soviet relations traversed a tortuous course in the past.
Today, we have come to a new starting point.''
   Gorbachev, in a statement issued upon his arrival, said the
spring season and its feelings of renewal and hope were ``consonant
with our mood. We hope that the meetings and talks we are going to
have with the Chinese leaders will mark a watershed in relations.''
   He said people of the Soviet Union ``follow with keen interest
the transformations that are unfolding in China,'' likely referring
to China's decade-old economic reform.
   Chinese officials say they will use the summit to press the
Soviets to use their influence over Vietnam to help end the 10-year
Cambodian conflict.
   More than 1,000 Soviet, Chinese and foreign journalists are
covering the visit, which will be highlighted Tuesday by
Gorbachev's meeting with Deng.
   Gorbachev will also hold talks with Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang and Premier Li Peng.

   Disabled people protesting the Bush
administration's challenge of a ruling requiring wheelchair lifts
on new transit buses say they hope their efforts will encourage the
handicapped to fight for their rights.
   About two dozen disabled people demonstrated outside the U.S.
Courthouse on Sunday night against the administration's request
that the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reconsider a Feb. 13
ruling.
   The full panel heard arguments today.
   Disabled people and their advocates had lauded the February
ruling as a means to put the handicapped in the economic
mainstream. But that turned to disappointment last month when the
federal government asked the entire panel to rehear the case.
   ``The Bush administration has given a lot of lip service to
mainstreaming,'' said Bob Kafka, of Austin, Texas.
   Although disabled people have won victories for accessible
transportation in several cities, the decision by the appeals court
was the first national triumph.
   ``We know we're going to be going to the Supreme Court,'' said
Fred Stark, of Jersey City, N.J.
   The case was brought by the American Disabled for Accessible
Public Transit, known as ADAPT, and other groups.
   Joe Carle, an ADAPT member from Dallas, said handicapped people
want the the disabled and their advocates to demonstrate their
disappointment with the appeal.
   Those at the courthouse said the issue of accessible public
transportation is part of a greater concern that handicapped people
have the same rights as people who are not disabled.
   ``It's not proper for the hospital to give us the will to live,
but society not to accept us,'' said Mike Newhall, of Cape Cod,
Mass.
   Carle said protests in other cities have been successful in
getting lifts on some buses and disabled people hope that strategy
will help now.
   He pointed to Dallas and Denver as cities where officials have
taken notice of protests by disabled people.
   In the 2-1 decision in February, the court ordered the U.S.
Department of Transportation to rewrite regulations that allow
communities to offer only ``paratransit'' service, such as van
rides, to the disabled. The court said the 24-hour reservations
that van riders need hinder spontaneous use of mass transit. They
said all new buses must be equipped with the lifts.
   Transit officials have criticized the decision, saying the
costly lifts are rarely used.
   In its petition, the government said transit agencies across the
country would pay a total of $90 million annually for the lifts.

   Stewart Perowne, a diplomat, archaeologist and
historian who wrote books on the history and antiquities of the
Mediterranean world, has died at the age of 87.
   Perowne died at Charing Cross Hospital on May 10.
   The son of an Anglican bishop, Perowne was educated at Harvard
and Cambridge universities and went first to Palestine under the
British mandate to serve in the educational service in 1927.
   He later served in Malta, Aden, Iraq, Barbados, Libya and in
Israel, where he designed and organized West Bank village
communities for refugees.
   His 18 books included guides to Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Malta,
Rome and Athens, and histories of Roman rulers and the early
Christians, among them ``The Life and Times of Herod the Great''
and ``The End of the Roman World.''
   Perowne is survived by his wife, Dame Freya Stark, who wrote
vivid travel books about the Middle East.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 240 tourists from Japan sailed for
Vladivostok on Monday after the Soviet Union agreed to allow
Japanese to tour the port for the first time since World War II,
according to an official in the city of Niigata.
   The official, Etsuro Motoi, said Niigata Mayor Genki Wakasugi
and Kazuo Watanabe, mayor of nearby Shinminato, were among those
who left Niigata, a port on the Japan Sea, aboard the 12,800-ton
Soviet ship Rusy.
   Vladivostok, a base for the Soviet Pacific fleet, is about 480
miles from Niigata.
   During a one-week visit, Wakasugi will discuss with Soviet
officials the possibility of establishing sister-city relations and
economic and cultural exchanges between Niigata and Vladivostok,
Motoi said.
   The Japan-Soviet Travel Service, a private tourist agency
sponsoring the trip, said it had been asking the Soviet Union for
two years to allow Japanese to tour Vladivostok. An agency official
said some Japanese had lived there before the war and wanted to see
it again.
   About 25,000 Japanese tourists visit the Soviet Union annually,
he added.

   A Roman Catholic worker was
shot to death Monday, and rocket and gunfire raked an office of
Sinn Fein, the political party associated with the Irish Republican
Army.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attacks.
   The workern, who was unloading a car at a job site in a
Protestant neighborhood, was killed by about a dozen shots fired by
a man who stepped out of a stolen van, police said. The van was
found abandoned about 300 yards from the residential street where
the worker was killed.
   The BBC and Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency,
said the victim was a Roman Catholic, although the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said it could not confirm that.
   It was the 25th death attributed to Protestant-Catholic violence
in Northern Ireland this year.

party maintains in the province, was hit by a rocket from a
Soviet-made RPG-7 launcher and several gunshots, police said. Four
people were in the office but they escaped injury, police said.

   The Sudanese government has again stalled
a train load of emergency food for civil war-plagued southern
Sudan, sources said Monday.
   Diane Weathers, a spokeswoman for the U.N.'s World Food Program,
said the government raised a last-minute objection to the departure
of the train, laden with 1,500 tons of food.
   The train, already delayed for a month, was to have left Muglad
in southwestern Sudan this week for Aweil, a government-held town
about 180 miles farther south.
   Under an earlier arrangement with the United Nations, the
government and rebels from the Sudan People's Liberation Front had
agreed that half of the food would go to Aweil, with the remainder
being dropped off at rebel-held towns along the way.
   ``There's been some quibbling over drop-off points,'' Ms.
Weathers said. ``(The rebels) wanted a 50-50 split, but the
government objected to that.''
   The new delay was the latest in a series of setbacks that have
plagued Operation Lifeline Sudan, a United Nations effort to save
100,000 people threatened with starvation.
   The $132 million program had aimed to stockpile 100,000 tons of
food in southern Sudan by the end of May, but has managed to
deliver less than half that amount so far.
   U.N. officials have described the operation as a race against
time and seasonal rains that begin in May and turn roads and
airfields into quagmires until November.
   The goal is to prevent a repeat of last year's disaster, when up
to 500,000 people died in the fighting in Sudan's 6-year-old civil
war or perished of starvation and disease in isolated villages.
   The heavy rains already have begun, halting a truck convoy bound
for the rebel-held town of Torit and forcing the cancellation of
flights by C-130 cargo planes.
   The C-130s were breaking up the rain-softened runway at Torit,
Ms. Weathers said, although flights by smaller planes continue from
Entebbe, Uganda.
   Carlton James, a spokesman for the United Nations Children's
Fund in Nairobi, acknowledged a new delay in the train's departure,
but said he did not know its cause.
   ``I've heard that the government has objected,'' James said,
``but if I told you all the rumors I've heard about that train it
would add up to a real litany of woe.''
   A spokesman for another U.N. agency participating in the
Lifeline Sudan project also said the train had been delayed by the
government. That source, who spoke on condition he not be
identified, said high-level negotiations were under way to try to
break the impasse.
   The train had been supposed to depart April 15, but was delayed
for nearly a month when railroad crews refused to travel through
the embattled area without an armed escort.
   Barges loaded with food also are stalled at Malakal on the Nile
River because of what Ms. Weathers described as ``a security
impasse.'' They are carrying between 6,000 and 7,000 tons of
supplies destined for southern towns, including Bor and Juba,
Sudan's southernmost provincial capital which has been under siege
by the rebels for more than two months.
   Ms. Weathers said a truck convoy organized by the French branch
of Doctors Without Frontiers was stalled by impassable roads at
Kapoeta, another rebel-held town a few miles north of the Kenya
border. It left Kenya on May 7 bound for Torit, but had to be
unloaded at Kapoeta when it could go no farther.

   Supporters of nearly 2,000 students on a hunger
strike for democracy focused their efforts Monday on supplying them
with water and salt tablets, but fears for their health intensified.
   ``If this continues and the temperature rises, I am worried
about the consequences,'' a doctor from the No. 1 Medical Institute
said 48 hours after the strike began.
   Dozens of students had been carried out fainting by Monday and
were taken to hospitals by ambulances. A harsh sun in the unshaded
square took a further toll on the students. Many covered their
heads with jackets.
   The Red Cross donated medicine for the strikers and doctors
joined medical students who have been looking after their
classmates.
   ``We don't have enough salt,'' said a sixth-year student at the
Beijing Medical University.
   ``Some students are not even willing to drink water in order to
show their determination. And some of those who are carried off say
they will come back when they are better,'' said a post-graduate
student from the Peking Union Medical College who was giving first
aid. ``Most are going on nothing but spirit.''
   At one point, a cry went up from one section of students:
``Bring a bottle! Bring a bottle!'' Medics rushed over with water
but soon came running back carrying an unconscious student. He was
placed in an ambulance.

<TEXT>
   Music also helped keep the strikers going _ and drowned out the
rising clamor of arguments among students whose bodies weakened and
nerves frayed.
   A group of students from the Beijing Normal University walked
among the prone strikers singing spirited music accompanied by an
accordion.
   ``Down with profiteering, down with profiteering, oppose
corruption,'' they sang to the tune of ``Frere Jacques.''
   A loudspeaker hooked up to two car batteries broadcast both
messages from the strike leaders and music _ a mixture of patriotic
songs and the theme from the James Bond movie ``Goldfinger.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Bands of about a dozen students each roamed nearby streets,
shouting their message of democracy to passersby. Most also carried
cardboard boxes and appealed for donations to buy food for the
non-fasting students and pay for unofficial student publications.
   ``Without the people we have no movement. People, people we need
your support,'' pleaded one collection team.
   Students announced over a loudspeaker that about $27,000 had
been donated over the month-long democracy movement.
   ``That's not much compared with the amount of money officials
make from illegal profiteering,'' sneered the announcer.

   Neatness was not the strong suit of the student protesters _ not
until Monday. Previous protests left Tiananmen Square littered with
papers, plastic containers and broken bottles.
   This time, students went to work with brooms made of banners
wadded around poles. They swept huge quantities of litter into
piles after most of the students moved early Monday from the center
of the square to the eastern portion.
   The move was made in order to ``give space'' on the west for a
government ceremony welcoming Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
for the first Sino-Soviet summit in three decades. But the gesture
was wasted because the government moved the welcoming ceremony to
the airport.
   And it didn't take long for the new strikers' camp to be just as
littered with bottles, newspapers and other debris.

<HEAD>Local Elections Take Pulse of Northern Ireland</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Ireland's local
elections Wednesday may help measure how much the gunmen, both
Catholic and Protestant, have hurt their political allies.
   No real power is at stake, but Sinn Fein officials concede they
have been damaged by the civilian deaths inflicted by the Irish
Republican Army, while the Rev. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist
Party has been embarrassed by the arrest of former allies who
allegedly were seeking a South African arms connection.
   Roads, schools and housing figure in the race for 566 seats on
26 councils. But passions seldom stray far from the core conflict
between Protestants who favor British rule and Catholics who want a
united Ireland.
   ``Hatred is mostly what motivates politics,'' says Paul Bew, a
professor of political science at Queen's University in Belfast.
``It is the Catholic candidate that brings out the Protestant vote,
and the Protestant vote that brings out the Catholic.''
   Thus elections in Northern Ireland, with roughly 900,000
Protestants and 600,000 Catholics, often are dismissed as sectarian
headcounts, and usually less than 1 percent of the vote crosses
religious lines.
   Yet in the district of Fermanagh, there has been some talk of
limited vote-trading between Catholic members of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party and Protestants of the Official Unionist
Party.
   ``Enough of it may happen to affect the situation,'' says John
O'Kane of the SDLP in Fermanagh.
   In local elections in 1985, Sinn Fein took 11.8 percent of the
vote while the larger, anti-violence SDLP polled 17.8 percent.
Among Catholics, the SDLP usually outpolls Sinn Fein 2-1.
   Sinn Fein's electoral strength was growing, Bew said, until a
string of IRA atrocities began with a bomb that killed 11
Protestants at Enniskillen on Nov. 8, 1987.
   Despite an appeal by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams to the IRA
to be ``careful and careful again,'' the incidents continued. In
the last, on April 12, the IRA tried to blow up a police barracks
in the heavily Catholic border town of Warrenpoint. The blast
killed a 19-year-old Catholic woman and damaged one in six houses.
   The Democratic Unionists suffered a further embarrassment on
April 24 when three members of the Ulster Resistance Movement were
arrested in Paris where they allegedly were seeking to swap a
stolen model of a Blowpipe missile for South African arms.
   Paisley and the DUP's deputy leader, Peter Robinson, had
appeared at Ulster Resistance rallies, but Paisley said those links
had since been severed.
   Since October, the British government has banned broadcast
appearances by Sinn Fein members, and has compelled all candidates
to take an oath that they do not support violence. The broadcast
ban is waived during the election campaign.
   Sinn Fein candidates took the oath but the party has not
renounced the strategy of using both violence and the electoral
process to further its goal of ridding Northern Ireland of British
rule.
   Despite that combination of official crackdown and IRA bungling,
``we hope and expect to hold our vote,'' said Sinn Fein spokesman
Richard McAuley.
   ``Sinn Fein has a hard core of ... votes which aren't going to
go away,'' said Sidney Elliott, a political scientist at Queen's
University. Opinion surveys have found that Sinn Fein attracts its
heaviest support from the young and the unemployed, while the SDLP
is more middle-class.
   ``There really isn't much of a floating vote between Sinn Fein
and the SDLP, whereas government policy is predicated on the
assumption that there is,'' says Bew. Sinn Fein's problem ``is
their own mistakes, not ... any strategy of government to
ameliorate conditions.''
   The DUP's vote share fell from 24.3 percent in 1985 to 11.7
percent in 1987, while the more moderate Official Unionists rose
from 29.5 to 37.8 percent.
   Both parties demand that Sinn Fein, like the IRA, be outlawed,
and they want tighter security along the border with the Irish
Republic. The DUP proposes ``hot pursuit'' of the IRA across the
frontier.
   The DUP has been hurt by defections of council members who want
an even tougher line.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis declared
today that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega ordered last week's attack
on opposition candidates in an attempt to assassinate one of them.
   ``What happened was a Noriega-directed attempt on the life of
one of the candidates,'' Davis said before departing Panama on
President Bush's orders.
   Witness reports and the type of wounds sustained by Guellermo
Ford, an opposition candidate for second vice president, ``showed
that the attack was designed to kill him.''
   Ford and his two fellow opposition candidates were attacked by
pipe-wielding thugs on Wednesday at the end of a political parade
that called for recognition of an opposition victory in May 7
elections.
   Davis said he could not reveal details of the evidence and said
he did not know why Ford was targeted.
   Davis credited Ford's bodyguards, one of whom died in the
attack, with saving Ford's life.
   After the news conference, Davis left for Howard Air Force Base
to depart the country. He was recalled by Bush last week after
opposition candidates were beaten in the streets of Panama City.
   He said he would return to Panama ``when conditions permit the
re-establishment of normal relations between the United States and
a legitimate government in Panama.''
   Davis said Noriega, not the Panama Defense Forces, is the
problem and that it may be up to progressive elements within the
defense forces ``to take care of it.''
   Meanwhile, American children at military bases returned to
school today, but work was suspended for Panamanian teachers
preparing for the opening day of the school year.
   The U.S. schools had been closed Friday while dependents were
moved on-post at Bush's order, and resumed today.
   A message from the U.S. Southern Command said parents who had
moved from their homes to the bases would be responsible for
getting their children to classes.
   The Panamanian school year was scheduled to begin May 22 for
660,000 primary, secondary and university students, and teachers
were to report today until the school year was postponed for
security reasons.
   The most cautiously independent newspaper, La Estrella, took the
opportunity to publish an editorial that said the annulment of last
week's elections had provoked ``a series of discomforts which does
not permit classes to begin in a normal way.''
   The newspaper also published a front page picture of Ford
entering church to applause from members of the congregation.
   The caption did not mention that the service turned into a
virtual opposition rally, with the congregation chanting
``Justicia, Justicia'' and passing out leaflets calling for a
24-hour general strike against Noriega's regime on Wednesday.
   The caption did say such scenes were ``repeated all over
Panama.''
   An opposition leader Sunday rejected any proposals for a junta,
saying the opposition won the May 7 elections and the victory
should be recognized.
   Exit polls by the Roman Catholic Church and surveys by
opposition poll-watchers had opposition candidate Guillermo Endara
ahead 3-1 over Carlos Duque when the count was stopped.
   At Panama City's Cristo Rey Church, a militant opposition
stronghold, the congregation jumped to its feet and cheered when
oppositon vice presidential candidates Ford and Ricardo Arias
Calderon walked in to take seats in front pews.
   Endara was greatly improved today and will probably be released
from the hospital Tuesday, a medical bulletin said.
   
   The church has not been as influential as it is in Nicaragua or
El Salvador, and its support for fair elections is a new element in
Panamanian politics.
   The Rev. Javier Villanueva, who celebrated Mass at Cristo Rey
Church, said the church ``is neither of the opposition nor of the
government. The church is where it should be.''
   There were brief protests at churches in the capital's poor
neighborhoods of San Miguelito and Rio Abajo and in the cities of
Colon and David.
   Churches that sympathize with the opposition have been attacked
in the past, but no police were visible and no incidents were
reported.
   Opposition supporters at many churches handed out leaflets
describing alleged government beatings of civilians and calling for
the general strike on Wednesday.
   ``Read, photocopy and pass along our newspaper,'' said a
handwritten note on one leaflet. The opposition press has been
closed down in Panama for more than a year.
   The crisis showed no sign of easing, although outside churches
it was a normal, lazy Sunday.
   ``The opposition works Monday to Friday, and so do we,'' said a
government official, when asked why troops had been given weekend
leave.
   Opposition leaders said Saturday that they would not rule out
talks with the Panamanian military, but that negotiations would
have to include removing Noriega from power.

<HEAD>Nader Weighs in on Alar Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader won a warm
response from a Senate panel today when he called for legislation
to immediately ban use of the pesticide Alar on apples.
   Nader said Congress ``should ban Alar by name, unilaterally and
immediately.''
   He told the Senate subcommittee on toxic substances that there
is now ``a convergence'' of interest between consumers who don't
want Alar on apples and apple growers hurt by plummeting apple
sales.
   Nader maintained the only opposition to an immediate ban comes
from suppliers of Alar, or daminozide.
   Stopping just short of saying he will introduce such a measure,
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., noted that Congress can act much more
quickly on such matters than the Environmental Protection Agency,
which announced over the weekend that it has started a procedure
that could lead to an Alar ban in about 18 months.
   ``What Congress can do one day, it can undo the next,'' said
Warner. ``We could simply pass a law tomorrow unilaterally banning
Alar and put that behind us.''
   Apples are a major agricultural product in Warner's state and he
noted that sales have been hurt severely by consumer reaction to a
series of news reports focusing on assertions that Alar poses a
serious cancer risk, particularly to children.
   ``It would bring back a measure of confidence in the consumer,
particularly the housewife struggling with children,'' Warner said
of legislation. ``I think we need some swift, decisive action to
restore confidence in the marketplace.''

<HEAD>New Radar Should Improve Flood Warnings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New radars now being tested could help lessen
the danger of one of the nation's biggest weather-related problems:
flash floods.
   While the drama of tornadoes and hurricanes tends to get more
attention, ``flash floods are the major cause of weather-related
deaths in the United States,'' reports Elbert W. Friday, the
director of the National Weather Service.
   ``They claimed over 1,800 lives in the 1970s and another 1,000
so far this decade,'' he reported.
   But with NEXRAD _ Next Generation Weather Radar _ that could
change as better storm information is coupled with land analyses
and computer programs in the next few years.
   ``It's more than a pipe dream; the reality of NEXRAD'' is here,
Rafael Bras of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which
operates a radar similar to the new NEXRA system, told a recent
meeting of geophysicists.
   ``I believe our way of predicting floods in the future will
change because our sources of data are changing,'' he said at a
meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Baltimore.
   Now being tested in Norman, Okla., NEXRAD could begin to be
installed around the country by this fall, said weather service
spokesman Donald Witten.
   The new radar system is expected to incorporate a computerized
program to warn local weather offices ``when too much rain falls in
too small an area in too short a time,'' said Witten.
   Deaths from flash flooding have increased in recent years, a
trend attributed to increasing development in low-lying areas near
rivers and streams.
   The development of the better warning system comes just a
century after the Johnstown, Pa., flood disaster.
   It was May 31, 1889 when waters of the South Fork Reservoir in
western Pennsylvania, swollen by two days of steady rain, broke
through an earthen dam and cascaded down the Conemaugh Valley into
Johnstown, killing at least 2,500 people.
   Today, parts of flood-prone Appalachia are protected by an
automated flood warning system operated by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
   But while IFLOWS _ Integrated Flood Observation and Warning
System _ covers 179 counties in seven states, flooding remains a
hazard in many other areas _ too many for human forecasters to keep
track of and issue detailed warnings.
   A reorganization of the National Weather Service is expected to
reduce the agency to 115 local forecast offices scattered across
the nation during the 1990s.
   ``There might be 1,000 points of flooding for each office,'' to
keep track of, said flood analyst John Schaake of the weather
service.
   But over the next decade or so NEXRAD _ Next Generation Weather
Radar _ will be installed at those offices, and that can make the
difference, said Bras.
   While current radar systems can see where storms are, NEXRAD
will allow meteorologists to track wind movements and estimate
rainfall over much of the area.
   Bras, using similar radar at MIT, has combined the readings with
detailed analyses of water runoff and stream flow patterns in the
Souhegan and Squanhacook river basins in New Hampshire in an
experiment to see if flooding can be better predicted.
   First, he said, he developed detailed topographical maps of the
river basins, including estimates of the slope, to calculate rates
of runoff and the velocity of streamflows in the region.
   Weather records for the area allowed him to calculate how
saturated the soil was to see how much water would be absorbed, and
how much would flow through the soil into lower-level streams and
creeks.
   With all these calculations in a computer, Bras explained, he
was able to estimate the stream flows and flood heights when the
advanced radar detected storms over the two river basins. In a
series of experiments the projections came very close to actual
water levels recorded on the scene, Bras said.
   Such projections could speed warnings to areas downstream of
heavy rains or sudden snowmelts, two major causes of flash flooding
in the United States.

<TEXT>
   U.S. immigration officials have granted
political asylum to a Cuban family from Florida that was stranded
in Canada for nearly five months after a sightseeing trip, a
newspaper reported today.
   The Buffalo News reported today that Carlos Fajardo and his
family will return to the United States Tuesday.
   The newspaper quoted a source close to the case as saying the
Fajardos would stay in Buffalo for a couple of days and then head
to Miami.
   The family has survived on charity in Niagara Falls and Fort
Erie, Ontario, while waiting for permission to re-enter the United
States. Their exile began Dec. 23 while on vacation when they
traveled north to view snow and crossed into Canada. They were
denied re-entry because they could not prove U.S. citizenship.
   Later, immigration officials determined that the family had a
history of immigration fraud.
   Benedict Ferro, district director of the federal Immigration and
Naturalization Service, had said that allowing the family to return
home would be an affront to millions of people waiting to enter the
country legally.
   But after a March application for asylum and subsequent INS
investigation, Ferro said he could overlook history of fraud
because the family had a legitimate fear of being persecuted if
returned to Cuba.
   ``Mr. Fajardo's claim is clearly not frivolous,'' Ferro said
last month. ``Indeed, if it is rising to the level of a
well-founded fear of being persecuted we will grant him asylum.''
   The source told the newspaper the Fajardos would try to
re-establish their boat-building business in Miami.

<TEXT>
   Nuclear power plant operators from around the
world gathered in Moscow on Monday to form a new association to
share safety information and prevent a repetition of accidents such
as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.
   Representatives of more than 300 power stations in 30 countries,
including the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain,
signed a charter inaugurating the World Association of Nuclear
Operators.
   Charter members represent about 115 of the 130 power companies
that produce electricity from nuclear reactors.
   ``Several major nuclear accidents, including Chernobyl, showed
that there were problems in communication,'' Soviet Atomic Energy
Minister Nikolai Lukonin, a co-chairman of the new association,
told the session. ``These problems have become global problems.''
   The association was conceived after the April 1986 fire and
explosion at Chernobyl in the Ukraine killed at least 31 people and
sent a poisonous cloud of radioactivity into the atmosphere.
   After Chernobyl, it became necessary to form a system of sharing
safety information to prevent future accidents, Lukonin said.
   The other co-chairman, Lord Walter Marshall of Britain's Central
Electricity Generating Board, said sharing information was
essential to prevent accidents such as Chernobyl and the 1979
nuclear waste spill at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
   ``The nuclear community has learned its lesson in painful
ways,'' he said. ``If utilities had acted together, these accidents
might not have happened.''
   ``Chernobyl has created determination among nuclear operators to
work together,'' he said.
   The association already has established regional headquarters in
Atlanta, Moscow, Paris and Tokyo. A communications center will be
operated in London to transmit information to member utilities,
Marshall said.
   According to the charter, its mission ``is to maximize the
safety and reliability of the operation of nuclear power plants by
exchanging information, encouraging comparison, emulation and
communication among its members.''
   Marshall said, ``nuclear power only benefits mankind if safety
is kept at the highest possible level.''
   He said the ultimate responsibility for safety rests with the
organizations that operate the plants. ``Each has a responsibility
to learn from others and avoid making mistakes made elsewhere,''
Marshall said.
   The two-day meeting ends Tuesday with election of a president
and arrangements for the next general assembly in two years.
   Many Soviets have become afraid of nuclear power since the
Chernobyl accident, and Soviet officials have canceled or curtailed
several plants because of stricter standards.
   Officials closed two nuclear generators at an Armenian power
plant located near a geological fault after the Dec. 7 earthquake
in northern Armenia.

   The Navy announced Monday its annual West

Harlan County and feature visits to nine countries.
   The ship will depart July 17 and spend eight weeks making calls
at various African ports, with Coast Guard, Marine Corps and Navy

   ``A large part of the in-port activities will involve
`people-to-people' events, with sailors from the USS Harlan County

Benin, Nigeria, Gabon, Zaire, Congo and Sao Tome. In addition, Rear
Adm. John R. Dalrymple, the commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet's
South Atlantic Force, will visit 10 other African nations to meet
with senior civil and military officials, the Navy said.

   The United States and Vietnam have scheduled
another meeting of technical experts this week to discuss the
search for American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, the
Pentagon said Monday.
   The meeting, to be held in Hanoi Tuesday and Wednesday, will be
the 10th since a special presidential emissary traveled to Vietnam
in August 1987 to improve government contacts on the issue.
   ``The U.S. team will be led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, the
commander of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center (JCRC) in
Hawaii,'' the Pentagon said in a statement.
   ``Other members of the team are technical experts on the POW-MIA
issue and include members of the JCRC and the U.S. Army Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii.''
   The last such technical meeting was held in Hanoi in March.

<HEAD>Newspapers, Slovak Government Attack Dam Decision</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia on Monday attacked
a decision by Hungary to halt a controversial joint dam project on
the Danube, branding it a ``one-sided'' attack on bilateral
agreements and international law.
   Hungary's decision Saturday to halt construction of its dam at
Nagymaros is the latest action to sour relations between the two
Warsaw Pact allies.
   The Slovak government, in a statement carried on the state news
agency CTK, said it was puzzled and surprised by the move,
especially because of what it said was a Hungarian drive to
accelerate work on the project under an agreement signed in
February.
   ``This is a one-sided step by the Hungarian government,'' the
statement said. ``Although it has full authority to decide things
on its territory, it contradicts the valid Czechoslovak-Hungarian
contract and international law.''
   The dam is part of a project agreed to in 1977 to build canals
and power stations off the Danube in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   Prague has invested $1.1 billion to date in its Gabcikovo dam
and power station, which is due to come on line this summer.
   Official criticism of the Hungarian decision to halt
construction and launch a two-month review of it followed an attack
in the Communist Party daily newspaper Rude Pravo.
   In recent months, the project had become ``an instrument for the
opposition forces to cast doubts on past decisions of the country's
leadership,'' Rude Pravo said.
   In this atmosphere, it added, it will be difficult for the
experts reviewing the Nagymaros project to be ``objective.''
   The Hungarian move highlights the contrasting politics in the
two nations.
   While opposition groups and political reform have gained
increasing hold in Hungary, Czechoslovakia's authorities have
rejected any role for unofficial organizations in its more cautious
restructuring.
   Relations soured visibly over Hungarian TV's unprecedented
broadcast last month of an interview with former Czechoslovak party
leader Alexander Dubcek, architect of the ``Prague Spring'' reforms
in 1968.
   The interview was Dubcek's first with official East bloc media
since he was expelled from the Czechoslovak Communist party in 1970
in the purge of almost half a million members by the current party
leader, Milos Jakes.
   Hungary ignored Czechoslovak protests about the first broadcast
with Dubcek in mid-April and transmitted a longer part of the
three-hour interview April 26.
   Journalist Andras Sugar, who conducted the interview, said in
Budapest last week he has received dozens of letters from Slovaks
who tuned in and approved of the broadcast.
   Hungarian Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz and Jakes played
down their political differences, emphasizing pragmatic
cooperation, when Grosz last visited Prague in mid-February.
   But the Nagymaros decision seems certain to cloud even economic
cooperation, while Czechoslovakia's decision to welcome Romanian
President Nicolae Ceausescu this week contrasts markedly with
recent Hungarian diplomacy.
   Hungary and Romania are locked in a fierce dispute over the fate
of the estimated 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania. Budapest
has made increasingly outspoken attacks on Ceausescu's tough
policies not just on ethnic issues, but on human rights in general.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last Soviets in Afghanistan seem a
forlorn group, sticking close to their fortress-like embassy and
complaining of waning influence even with the rulers their armed
forces supported.
   At the height of the Red Army's nine-year involvement in the
Afghan civil war, an estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers were in the
country, along with hundreds of political and military advisers.
   Fewer than 275 Soviets remain, and many are present only to feed
and sustain the few officials left behind. Having failed to win the
war for the Marxist government it sponsored, the Kremlin has
switched positions to that of peacemaker.
   Soviet military forces began pulling out of Afghanistan on May
15, 1988, under a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   Since completing the withdrawal Feb. 15, Moscow has been beating
the diplomatic bushes from Washington to Islamambad and Beijing,
urging that arms supplies to the Moslem guerrillas be stopped and
peace talks started.
   The insurgents, who began fighting after a communist coup in
April 1978, have vowed to continue the war until the government
falls.
   ``We made mistakes; we don't deny this,'' said Yuli M.
Vorontsov, the Soviet first deputy foreign minister and ambassador
to Kabul. ``Afghanistan needs a respite from this war. We need to
stop pushing arms and start pushing them to the negotiating table.''
   In Moscow on Monday, the Soviet Union once again accused the
United States and Pakistan of failing to comply with the agreement.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, said the Americans and
Pakistanis signed the accord ``already having decided not to
fulfill it. For them the main goal was to gain the withdrawal of
Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan.''
   It accused Pakistan of sending thousands of its soldiers to help
the guerrillas and of planning strategy for the insurgents.
   Soviet officials regularly criticize the two nations for
continuing to supply arms to the insurgents.
   Although the Geneva agreement calls for non-interference in
Afghanistan, it does not specifically address supplying weapons.
The United States has said it will continue arming the guerrillas
as long as the Kremlin supplies weapons to the Afghan military.
   Animosity developed as soon as the Red Army arrived in
Afghanistan in December 1979.
   Taxi drivers curse their battered Moskvich cars. Merchants on
Chicken Street, a thriving strip of carpet shops, antique dealers
and food stores selling Russian caviar and vodka, speak of hatred
for the Soviets.
   ``We're glad they're gone,'' carpet dealer Mohammad Ghulam said
whle washing the blue Mercedes he parks in front of his shop.
``They were not welcome here. Life has been better since they
left.''
   Government and military officials speak approvingly of the
Soviets, but also try to keep their distance.
   ``Let's be honest,'' a Foreign Ministry official said privately.
``Even though the Soviet Union gave us a lot of assistance, there
aren't many Afghans who consider the Soviet Union as a friend.''
   Soviet representatives remaining in Kabul spend most of their
time inside their fortress in western Kabul, whose security has
been compared to that of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut.
   The embassy compound is surrounded by a high wall equipped with
double steel gates and remote-controlled TV cameras.
   Supplementing the strong gate is a zigzag pattern of concrete
blocks. Afghan soldiers in wooden guardhouse and on the road
outside quickly pointing their automatic rifles at approaching
visitors.
   Aside from contacts with Afghan government officials, the most
common business of the embassy seems to be dealing with Western
reporters who seek background briefings.
   Over tea and bowls of nuts and raisins, the Soviets speak with
some candor about their situation and the Afghan military.
   Soviet bombs and missiles are being used to defend Jalalabad,
which has been under guerrilla siege since early March. A Soviet
military airlift is flying up to 50 planeloads of food and weapons
a day to the eastern city.
   A senior Soviet official said, however, that he and his
colleagues had trouble getting their views across to the Afghans.
   ``It's like trying to plant a tropical plant in Siberia,'' he
said. ``We have the best-trained people but they have their own
ideas about what they want to do and in which direction they want
to go.''

<HEAD>Magazine Says Aides of Some Representatives Worked on Campaigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 94 House Democrats and 69 Republicans
had one or more of their aides working on their re-election
campaigns last year while being paid from public money, National
Journal said in its latest issue.
   The Washington-based magazine said in its May 13 edition that
the practice may have been a violation of House rules.
   The magazine said its investigation found that in 67 cases,
campaign managers for Democrats running for re-election to the
House received at least some income from official sources during
the last half of 1988. It said 47 of these campaign managers were
employed in the members' district offices.
   It said at least 39 Republican campaign managers were drawn from
the House staff.
   Overall, the magazine said, at least 40 percent of the 408 House
members who sought re-election last November had one or more of
their chief congressional aides serving in a top campaign post.
   National Journal said some of the aides took leave to do the
political work, but others worked for campaigns during vacation or
after hours.
   The magazine said the possible violations ``stem from the
longstanding ambiguity in the House rules over the proper line
between official duties and election work.''
   House regulations bar aides from campaign work during official
work hours, but the magazine quoted Michael Henry Jr., assistant
chief of the House's finance office, as saying, ``There is no way
for our office to determine if a staffer is doing campaign work.''
   The magazine said Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., wrote to the House
ethics committee on Oct. 3 asking if his use of office aides in his
campaign raised any problems.
   Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, and Rep.
John T. Myers of Indiana, the ranking Republican, replied on Oct.
18 that there are no formal rules prohibiting a House aide from
doing campaign work.
   The letter, however, cited ``general guidelines and House rules
which should be observed when this is done.'' They suggested that
Espy ``keep separate documentation for the hours worked in each
area.''
   The magazine said members who keep such records are not required
to make them public.
   National Journal said Robert Bush, who was Espy's administrative
assistant last year, served without salary as his campaign manager
and received nearly $8,000 from the campaign for reimbursement of
travel and supplies.
   Karen Hinton, Espy's congressional press secretary, held the
same title for the campaign. She received $2,550 a month in House
salary and nothing from the campaign, the magazine said.

<HEAD>Black Employees Halt Work to Protest Disinvestment Tactics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 240 black employees of
Mobil Oil stopped work Monday to protest the U.S. company's failure
to negotiate with their union prior to announcing the sale of its
South African holdings, the union said.
   The Chemical Workers Industrial Union, which represents about 80
percent of Mobil's 1,500 black employees in South Africa, said nine
installations in Johannesburg and other communities were affected
by the work stoppage.
   Chris Bonner, a union official in Johannesburg, said she had not
heard from shop stewards about whether the protest might continue
Tuesday. She also said she did not know what effect the stoppage
had on Mobil operations.
   There was no immediate comment from Mobil.
   The union plans to poll its members later this week to determine
if they support a nationwide strike against Mobil because of its
refusal to negotiate the terms of its disinvestment.
   The company announced April 28 it was selling its holdings in
South Afrivca to the General Union Mining Corp., a conglomerate
known as Gencor that owns a petroleum subsidiary.
   Mobil said Gencor would not change employment practices and
would honor all existing arrangements with the union. But union
officials nonetheless were angered, saying Mobil had rebuffed past
attempts to open negotiations by insisting there were no plans for
disinvestment.
   The union had approached Mobil and several other foreign
companies in South Africa, asking for 12-month advance notice of
any pullout, guarantees of job security amd full disclosure of the
terms of sale.
   Scores of U.S. companies have withdrawn from South Africa in the
past five years, citing economic considerations and pressure from
the anti-apartheid movement.

<NOTE>Nader Weighs in on Alar Issue</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader won a warm
response from a Senate panel today when he called for legislation
to immediately ban use of the chemical Alar on apples.
   Nader said Congress ``should ban Alar by name, unilaterally and
immediately.''
   He told the Senate subcommittee on toxic substances that there
is now ``a convergence'' of interest between consumers who don't
want Alar on apples and apple growers hurt by plummeting apple
sales.
   Nader maintained the only opposition to an immediate ban comes
from suppliers of Alar, or daminozide.
   The chemical is used to regulate growth and extend shelf life of
apples.
   Stopping just short of saying he will introduce such a measure,
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., noted that Congress can act much more
quickly on such matters than the Environmental Protection Agency,
which announced over the weekend that it has started a procedure
that could lead to an Alar ban in about 18 months.
   ``What Congress can do one day, it can undo the next,'' said
Warner. ``We could simply pass a law tomorrow unilaterally banning
Alar and put that behind us.''
   Apples are a major agricultural product in Warner's state and he
noted that sales have been hurt severely by consumer reaction to a
series of news reports focusing on assertions that Alar poses a
serious cancer risk, particularly to children.
   ``It would bring back a measure of confidence in the consumer,
particularly the housewife struggling with children,'' Warner said
of legislation. ``I think we need some swift, decisive action to
restore confidence in the marketplace.''

   Some students were a little bleary-eyed
after their long flight from Japan, but classes started on schedule
today at the first fully accredited Japanese high school in the
United States.
   The school in the eastern Tennessee hills is intended for the
children of Japanese executives in the United States, but all but
one of the first class of 24 students came from families in Japan.
   School opened with a half-hour of Christian values teaching, and
then classes started promptly at 8:40 a.m., said Hiroshi Jo,
director of Tennessee Meiji Gakuin High School.
   ``I think they're doing OK. Some of the kids have jet lag,'' Jo
said.
   Last year Meiji Gakuin University in Tokyo bought the former
Tennessee Military Institute in Sweetwater for use as a Japanese
school. The school is for students in grades 10-12.
   Japanese executives in this country have said their children
sometimes find it difficult to get into their native country's
colleges after getting their high school diplomas in the United
States.
   There are 71 Japanese-owned operations in Tennessee, including a
Nissan auto plant in Smyrna, in central Tennessee, and a new
Nippodenso Manufacturing USA auto parts plant in Maryville, not far
from Sweetwater.
   So far, however, the school is attracting students from families
in Japan who want their children to have the experience of living
abroad, Jo said. He said he expected that to change, and that most
of the students eventually would be from Japanese families working
in the United States.

   A developer agreed today to delay construction of
an office project on top of the remains of the Rose Theater, where
William Shakespeare debuted as an actor.
   Nicholas Ridley, the minister of the environment, told
Parliament today that the development company Imry Merchant had
agreed to delay work on the office block for as long as a month.
   Meanwhile, Ridley said, the government and the conservation
group English Heritage would work with the developer to preserve
the archaeological find. Ridley said the government would
contribute to the cost.
   The announcement followed an all-night vigil by show business
people seeking to save the theater's newly excavated shell.
   ``Nothing like this exists in the world. Replicas of Elizabethan
theaters are being built everywhere but this is the real thing and
you don't throw away the real thing,'' said actor Ian McKellen at
the excavated Rose Theater.
   At daybreak by Southwark Bridge on the south bank of the Thames
river, McKellen joined Dame Judi Dench, Edward Fox and others to
block the bulldozers.
   Preserving the remains and making them viewable is estimated to
cost about $3.3 million.
   Shakespeare is thought to have made his debut as an actor at the
Rose in 1592 and to have acted there in his own play, ``Henry VI.''
   Rose Alley, which leads to the site, commemorates the theater's
name some 350 years after the theater was pulled down.

<TEXT>
   Congress, forced by public opinion to deny
itself a pay raise, is about to go through an annual ritual that
calls attention to how much it gets on the side.
   The total is likely to match or exceed the $9.8 million reported
last spring, an amount 30 percent above the previous year in
honoraria, fees chiefly paid for making speeches.
   Under self-imposed rules, members are allowed to take no more
than $2,000 per appearance. Senators may keep no more than an
amount equal to 40 percent of their salaries, or $35,800, and House
members no more than 30 percent, or $26,850.
   The rest Congress gives to charities. Last year, members
reported giving away $2.3 million and keeping $7.5 million during
1987.
   How much was accepted in 1988 comes clear soon. Senators will
make public their financial disclosure forms on Friday, House
members on Monday.
   The forms disclose speech fees and such matters as what stocks
the members bought, sold and own.
   A move is gathering momentum to ban honoraria.
   President Bush said last month he would propose a ban when he
resubmits a congressional pay raise proposal to Congress. But he
said there was no point in recommending a raise again any time soon
in light of the battering Congress took in January when a public
outcry forced it to vote down a 51 percent pay increase.
   The commission that had proposed the pay raise coupled its
recommendations with a call on Congress to eliminate honoraria.
That call was endorsed last month by a commission Bush created to
study ethics issues.
   ``The potential for abuse or the appearance of abuse is obvious
to the public, and public faith in the integrity of the members it
elects is threatened by the steady growth in this practice,'' the
commission said.
   It noted that speech fees are often paid by groups ``with a
material interest in pending or anticipated legislation.''
   Last year, the defense industry alone paid more than $500,000 in
speaking fees to members of congressional committees that deal with
defense issues.
   When Congress voted to reject the proposed pay raise, it did
nothing to crack down on honoraria.
   Common Cause, a private group that has campaigned for tougher
ethical standards, says more than 245 newspapers have editorialized
for a ban, calling the fees ``legalized bribery,'' ``legislative
prostitution'' and ``lobbyists' payola.''
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee that is considering new ethics laws, said he favors a
ban, although he would allow members to continue such moonlighting
activities as teaching a course in law school.
   ``They started out legitimate, but unfortunately some people
abuse them,'' Frank says of honoraria. ``Some people solicit them.
I've stopped taking them.''
   A number of congressional freshmen also have decided not to
accept honoraria. They may have been mindful of last fall's
election results: the six incumbent members of Congress who were
defeated all had ethical problems of one kind or another.

   An Israeli group asking to participate in an

   The six Israelis, including a Tel Aviv University Soviet expert,
a Russian-language correspondent for Israel Radio and four Soviet
Jewry emigration activists, submitted requests for visas to the
Soviet consulate in Vienna through the World Jewish Congress, said
spokesman Yuri Stern.
   He said the group asked to participate in the three-day Moscow

organizations in the Latvian capital of Riga on May 21-22.
   Stern said an official of the Soviet consulate in Vienna said by
telephone that the group's request had been denied by the Soviet
Foreign Ministry.
   The refusal contradicted Soviet assurances on human rights
issues given to U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III during a
visit to Moscow last week, alleged Stern, of the Soviet Jewry
Zionist Forum based in Jerusalem.

   The rate of coal mining fatalities matched a
record low pace in the first quarter of 1989 while the rate of
deaths in the non-coal mining sector was up from the same period
last year, the government said Monday.
   The Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration
reported 12 coal mining deaths in the first three months of this
year, compared with 11 during the same period last year. But
because of an increase in the number of hours worked in coal mining
over last year, the agency said the fatality rate matched last
year's record low of 0.03 for every 200,000 hours worked.
   For all of 1988, there were 52 reported coal mining deaths and
48 non-coal mining fatalities, the lowest ever reported.
   The rate of non-fatal injuries in coal mining that involved lost
work time in the first quarter was 7.36 injuries for 200,000
employee hours, down from 8.32 in the first quarter of 1988 and
below the 8.01 rate for all of last year.
   In the non-coal sector, there were 16 deaths in the first
quarter, up from 11 in that period of 1988. Non-fatal injuries
involving lost work time occurred at a rate of 4.16 for every
200,000 employee hours worked, up from the 3.88 in the first three
months of 1988 and 4.12 for all of last year.

<HEAD>Skinner Predicts Approval For First Major Airport In 15 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
predicted Monday that Denver voters in a referendum Tuesday will
approve construction of the nation's first major new airport in 15
years, and he suggested that other cities would be well advised to
follow suit.
   Calling the Denver plan ``the most creative aviation development
project in many years,'' Skinner said local and federal officials,
including himself, were ``sticking their necks out'' to support the
project, which is estimated to cost between $1.7 billion and $2.3
billion.
   Owners of businesses who would be affected by abandonment of
Denver's 60-year-old Stapleton airport have hired political
consultant Roger Ailes to help with a campaign against the new
airport, which is to be financed primarily from airport revenue.
Ailes was the media wizard behind George Bush's presidential
campaign last fall.
   Skinner, in a speech to a privatization conference, said the new
airport would make Denver's economy ``the most exciting in the
country.''
   ``It's the right thing to do: the creative, exciting, dynamic,
necessary thing to do,'' Skinner said, adding that he expects the
referendum on the airport to pass.
   Polls released last weekend by both Denver newspapers indicate
voters favor passage of the referendum by a 2-to-1 margin.
   Skinner noted the success of Dulles International Airport
outside Washington in attracting economic growth to Virginia
suburbs 25 miles from the capitol.
   With the rapid growth of air travel, the aviation industry is
becoming increasingly concerned about the limited capacity of the
nation's airports. The last major airport to open was the
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in 1974.
   New airports have been discussed for New York, Chicago, Atlanta
and Los Angeles, but aviation industry experts say it will take 10
years or more to build any airport once planning is begun.
   The new Denver airport would be built 17 miles from Stapleton,
on the northeast edge of the city.
   ``I just wish everybody in this country thought as big as the
people in Denver do on the new airport,'' Skinner said.

   A fire and explosion injured 12
people today at a plant that makes submersible oil well pumps.
   The blast apparently was sparked by a propane gas leak, Fire
Chief George Oates said. The Reda plant was evacuated while
firefighters and workers put out the blaze.
   The leak appeared to have been in a pipe that took the gas to a
building where nearby machinery may have ignited the gas, Oates
said.
   Two of the injured were flown to a burn center in Tulsa, two
were admitted to Jane Phillips Episcopal Memorial Medical Center in
Bartlesville and seven were treated a released, hospital
spokeswoman Laurie Kendall said. The status of the 12th person
wasn't immediately determined.

   A judge has ducked a chance to step into
the middle of the annual snowball fight between students of rival
colleges.
   Superior Court Judge John F. Moriarty tossed out a lawsuit in
which Amherst College sought to force the University of
Massachusetts trustees to stop their students from throwing
snowballs at winter's first snowfall.
   Moriarity said a court doesn't have the power to hold college
trustees responsible for the off-campus antics of students with a
``juvenile propensity.''
   Amherst officials contended that in the past three years the
1,500-student private college has sustained $9,352 in broken
windows when students from the 25,000-student state university
surged across the Town Common. In December, an Amherst student was
hospitalized after being hit in the eye with an icy missile.
   ``Amherst College has a security force of 10 and as such is not
equipped to deal effectively with 2,000 rioters from another
institution,'' the lawsuit said.
   In his decision Friday, Moriarty took a cold view of the
property damage.
   ``There have, during the past several years, been some true
bullies among the crowd of students from the University,'' he said.
But he added that students would have to be sued or prosecuted as
individuals for specific acts.
   ``Most university students are technically adults, although at
least some of them obviously retain juvenile propensity,'' he said,
``so not even their parents, much less university trustees, can be
held responsible for their off-campus antics.''
   Amherst College President Peter R. Pouncey said Monday the
college may appeal.

   President Bush, declaring that it was time to
``take back the streets,'' announced today a $1.2 billion anticrime
package highlighted by a ban on certain imported semiautomatic
assault weapons and restrictions on domestic models.
   Bush said he would make permanent a 2-month-old suspension on
importation of the semiautomatic assault-style rifles if a
government review finds they are not for sporting purposes, as is
required under current law.
   The president outlined his proposals at a police memorial
service outside the Capitol before a rain-drenched crowd of
thousands huddled under umbrellas and plastic sheets or standing
unprotected.
   The audience included more than 700 relatives of the 161
officers killed in the line of duty nationwide last year. Also
present were uniformed officers from around the country.
   Bush turned away an aide offering an umbrella during the
drizzling rain. ``If it doesn't start clearing up,'' he joked,
``we're issuing snorkels to everybody out there.''
   Although many U.S.-made models of semi-automatic weapons are
virtually identical to their foreign competitors, Bush decided not
to apply the same ban to the domestic market.
   Instead, he took on the controversial issue from a different
approach: he proposed legislation to block manufacture, transfer or
sale of gun magazines capable of holding more than 15 rounds.
   The president said that during the heated debate over
gun-control and semiautomatic weapons, he has heard many opinions
and voices, including those of crime victims and families.
   ``We gather today to respond to those voices, and to honor the
fallen by launching a new national strategy _ a partnership with
America's cities and states _ to take back the streets,'' he said.
   Bush noted the debate over how to distinguish criminally used
assault weapons from those used for hunting and sport.
   ``There is substantial controversy and debate on this point. But
one thing that we do know about these `assault' weapons is that
they invariably are equipped with unjustifiably large magazines,''
he said.
   An administration official who briefed reporters on the package
earlier shrugged off questions about why the domestic market was
being treated differently than the imports when the weapons have
the same firpower.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said only
that existing import laws provide for a crackdown on the
foreign-made models while new legislation _ which would likely
involve a thorny and drawn-out congressional battle _ would be
needed for the domestic guns.
   In trying to determine what set semiautomatic assault weapons
apart, administration officials found the ``large detachable''
magazines were a common factor.
   Thus, domestic weapons, while not banned from sale, would be
restricted by the 15-round magazine ban.
   ``The fact of the matter is, nearly half the households in this
country have guns. The guns are already out there. And the
overwhelming majority are legitimately owned for legitimate
pruposes,'' Bush said in his speech.
   However, he said, 80 percent of all firearms used by felons are
stolen or otherwise obtained unlawfully. ``So let me be very clear
about our response: the right to own guns is not a license to harm
others,'' he said.
   The president's anti-crime package contained several measures
aimed at stiffer enforcement, more federal officers and a crackdown
on gun use among criminals.
   Among the provisions he proposed:
   _Doubling the current five-year minimum sentence for using a
semiautomatic firearm in commission of a crime.
   ``The math is simple,'' Bush said. ``Anyone who uses a
semiautomatic for crime _ or so much as has one on them during a
crime _ will do an automatic 10 extra years in federal prison. No
probation. No parole.''
   _Implementing the death penalty and designating the use of a
firearm as an ``aggravating factor'' for determining whether the
death penalty should be imposed.
   _Spending $1 billion for new prison construction.
   _Authorizing 825 new federal agents and staff in the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, U.S. Marshal Service and FBI.
   Bush said, ``Our police need more help. And I'm here today to
tell you that we're prepared to match rhetoric with resources _ and
call on our cities and states to do the same.''
   _Blocking the practice of plea-bargaining away charges of using
a gun in commission of a federal crime. Bush urged state and local
governments to similarly reform their laws so that anyone using a
gun would be prosecuted for that charge.
   _Requiring juveniles to be tried as adults for cases considered
serious drug offenses under the Armed Career Criminal statute.
   _Strengthening laws against criminal access to firearms by
expanding the existing ban on sales to people convicted of violent
crimes, to cover anyone convicted of violent misdemeanor offenses.
   _Adding 1,600 positions in the U.S. attorneys' office.
   _Identifying government properties and facilities that can be
converted to jails and prisons.
   _Offering a 5 percent bonus to drug law enforcement grants to
states that follow his standards on stiffening penalties for use of
a gun in committing a crime.
   On the assault weapons matter, Bush ordered the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms two months ago to review uses of
imported semiautomatic assault weapons to determine if they are
used for other than sporting purposes. Current law allows the
imports for only that purpose, but because of the sticky definition
questions, many have been allowed in that will be banned after the
review, administration officials said.

   The number of 16- to 24-year-olds seeking work
this summer will be about 706,000 below the level of last year
because of a continued population decline in that age group, the
government said Monday.
   An estimated 3.3 million people in that age group, mostly
students seeking summer jobs and high school and college graduates
looking for permanent jobs, will enter the labor force between now
and July, the Labor Department said.
   It said there were 21.3 million people aged 16 to 24 in the
civilian labor force as of last month and projected the number
would swell to 24.6 million by July, down from 25.3 million last
year.
   The 21.3 million April figure is down from last year as well.
There were 21.6 million 16- to 24-year-olds who either had jobs or
were looking for jobs in April 1988, the department said.

   The U.S. industrial operating rate rose
moderately to 83.9 percent in April, but factories remain under
less strain than when the year began, the government said Monday.
   Although the Federal Reserve Board's report showed industry
using more of its capacity last month, it revised its figures for
the first three months of the year to show less activity than
previously reported.
   ``This fits in with the general pattern of slowness,'' said Lyle
Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America.
   The capacity rate hit its most recent peak of 84.3 percent in
December _ a 10-year high. The rate held steady in January and
slipped in both February and March.
   ``The report shows relatively sluggish growth, but continued
growth,'' said economist David Wyss of Data Resources Inc., a
Lexington, Mass., consulting firm. ``That's what you want to see at
this stage of the (business) cycle.''
   Economists had been concerned that the steady upward march of
the rate through last year signaled intensified inflationary
pressures. A year ago, the rate was 82.7 percent. Economists say an
85-percent rate clearly signals a pickup in inflation.
   As operating rates near full capacity, factories find it
difficult to produce enough to meet demand. That, in turn, can lead
to shortages and price increases.
   Since March 1987, the central bank has been trying to ease
inflationary pressures by raising interest rates. Monday's report
is the latest in a series of government statistics indicating the
strategy appears to be working, particularly in housing, which is
sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.
   ``Total utilization appears to have eased slightly since
January,'' the central bank said, adding, ``The easing ... has
shown up in many industries, especially building-related
industries.''
   At manufacturing plants, the operating rate rose a slight 0.1
percentage point to 84.0 percent _ 0.7 percentage points lower than
in January.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods, ``big ticket''
items expected to last three or more years, rose from 82.4 percent
to 82.6 percent in April, reflecting increases at auto plants,
aerospace manufacturers and both electrical and non-electrical
machinery factories. The rate slipped at factories producing
primary metals such as steel and at fabricated metals plants.
   At plants manufacturing non-durable goods, the rate edged up
from 86.1 percent to 86.2 percent last month.
   In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the
operating rate jumped from 81.6 percent to 82.7 percent, the
highest since December. Economists said the increase likely was in
response to crude oil prices, which have risen steeply in recent
months.
   At utilities, the rate held steady at 82.1 percent.
   In a second report Monday, the Federal Reserve said the pace of
industrial production rose 0.4 percent in April after holding
steady in March and falling 0.3 percent in February, the first
decline in a year.
   The Fed's Industrial Production Index stood at 141.1 percent of
its 1977 base, 4.2 percent higher than a year ago.
   Production rose 0.4 percent at manufacturing plants making both
durable and non-durable goods. Output from mines and oil wells
jumped 1.2 percent following a 1.0 percent rise in March but was
still 1.4 percent lower than a year ago. Production at utilities
edged up 0.1 percent after falling 0.5 percent a month earlier.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, stumping
for the opposition Monday, used the site of a famous peasant
uprising against Russia to urge farmers to vote for his candidates
to the National Assembly next month.
   Walesa, wearing a folk costume with a feathered cap, urged the
crowd of 5,000 not to boycott the elections, as some are planning.
   ``Don't stand aside,'' Walesa said. ``Poland belongs to you and
you have to make it better.''
   The visit to the countryside on Pentecost Monday, a traditional
farmers' holiday, was the latest campaign swing by Walesa in
Solidarity's fight to elect its slate to the National Assembly in
balloting June 4, the first democratic voting in postwar Poland.
   Walesa is a much-sought guest speaker by candidates for the
Solidarity Citizens Committee _ the group he set up to direct the
opposition's campaign.
   The crowd spread out at the Raclawice Battlefield near Krakow in
southern Poland, where peasant legions armed with scythes and
commanded by Tadeusz Kosciuszko defeated a czarist army in 1794.
   Likening Walesa to Kosciuszko, a hero of the American
Revolutionary War and the 1794 uprising against Russia, activists
conferred on him the honorary title ``commander'' _ the title used
by Kosciusko during the uprising.
   Wearing a long white embroidered jacket and a four-cornered red
hat with a peacock feather, Walesa arrived in an open horse-drawn
carriage. Walking ahead of him were similarly dressed farmers
carrying long-handled scythes.
   Walesa also held a scythe during his ride, but when he mounted
the speaker's platform he laid it aside.
   ``I am putting down the scythe so we can talk in a peaceful
way,'' he said.
   ``Poland has had its difficult path and you all know this. But
it is beautiful and can be even more beautiful.
   ``Sometimes you had to take up scythes, and sometimes, like
today, you have to turn the scythes into votes,'' he said. ``Those
votes are just as essential for Poland.''
   At stake are 161 seats for which the opposition is allowed to
run in the Sejm, the existing 460-seat parliament, and 100 seats in
the Senate, a new legislative body that will be the first in the
East bloc chosen entirely by democratic methods.
   Leaflets at the rally accused Walesa of aiding the government
and urged a boycott. But the Solidarity leader was interrupted with
applause when he faced such charges head on.
   ``It cannot be said that Walesa was bought by the government.
... I wasn't sold to anybody,'' he said. ``But I cannot always
clench a knife between my teeth and chase the government, because
it wouldn't be nice.''
   He told people to support Solidarity-backed candidates, and also
to look at the candidates for the 65 percent of the Sejm being
contested by people from the Communist Party and its allies.
   ``Among them are both really wonderful people and people who are
much worse. So we can also have influence on that. You have to
cross them out and leave the people who are better,'' he said.
   Walesa struck a mild tone in the speech compared to a strongly
anti-communist, anti-Russian speech that preceded him. Local Rural
Solidarity leader Stefan Jagla said Raclawice in 1794 ``taught
Russia ... a lesson that they remember to this day''
   ``The Russian flag is all red and since the time when they
adopted that flag there has always been bloodshed,'' Jagla said,
reminding listeners of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact at the
start of World War II. ``Let us hope that all of Poland will turn
white one day, when it is taken over by `white' Solidarity.''
   But Walesa told the crowd that today's communists are not the
same as the communists of the 1950s.
   Unlike Stalinist times, he said, ``they don't imprison us and
they allowed pluralism in Poland. The ruling system is the same,
but the people in it are different.''
   The hillside and field where the crowd sat was abloom in
Solidarity banners. Many men wore their Sunday suits and women were
in colorful peasant kerchiefs.
   Farmers with sunburned faces complained the state doesn't pay
them enough for their milk and livestock, that machinery is in
short supply and that taxes are too high.
   ``The party has stolen enough money. Now it's time to stop
them,'' said Marian Popiolek of Raclawice.

<TEXT>
   The engineer and brakeman of a
runaway train that killed four people and leveled a row of suburban
homes had been cited previously for safety violations,
investigators said.
   The 69-car freight train carrying a sandy mineral used to make
potash jumped the tracks at 90 mph Friday morning when it failed to
make a curve along a residential neighborhood. Trains normally slow
to 30 mph for the curve.
   Engineer Frank Holland, who survived the crash, had been cited
for exceeding maximum authorized speed while guiding a train on
March 31, 1986, and for failing to properly connect brake lines
between locomotives on Feb. 13, 1988, said James Kolstad, National
Transportation Safety Board acting chairman. Holland was listed as
stable with a collapsed lung at St. Bernardine Medical Center.
   Brakeman Allan R. Riess, 42, of Bakersfield, who was killed in
the crash, had been cited for failing to take action in a case of
an engineer exceeding authorized speed on Oct. 7, Kolstad said
Sunday.
   The conductor of the runaway Southern Pacific train, E.S. Crown
of Bakersfield, who also was killed, had no violations on his
record, Kolstad said.
   ``It is not unusual after a number of years on the line for
trainmen to have violations on their record,'' NTSB spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz said today.
   Investigators today were interviewing crew members and workers
who loaded the train cars with sandy sodium carbonate, a mineral
used to make potash, in Rosamond, he said.
   Southern Pacific spokesman Jerry Pera declined to comment on the
crew safety violations today, saying the NTSB had asked the
railroad not to talk about it while the investigation was under way.
   Salvage workers were lifting the last of the locomotives onto
flatcars for movement out of the area, Pera said. Damage to the
train and track was about $3.8 million.
   The railroad plans to rebuild the embankment cut away for the
salvage effort and replace the ruined portion of track. The tracks
could be back in service late Tuesday, Pera said.
   Investigators also considered faulty brakes and possibly
overloaded cargo hoppers as possible causes.
   Crew members may not have known how heavy their freight train
was and may have miscalculated the braking capability during their
descent from a 4,109-foot mountain pass, Lopatkiewicz said.
   Faulty brakes were found in one of four leading locomotives and
one of two trailing engines in place to help slow the train down
the grade, Lopatkiewicz said.
   Brakes were applied so hard during the fatal plunge that some
were still hot more than 24 hours later, he said.
   The braking malfunction was possibly compounded by train cars
loaded with more cargo than indicated on a shipping document,
Lopatkiewicz said.
   The document indicated that ``each of the hopper cars had about
a two-thirds load, but we have witnesses that say some of the cars
were loaded up to the edge,'' he said.
   The crew ``could have been handling the train under conditions
they weren't aware of and it would not have reacted the way they
expected.''
   Investigators planned to create a computer simulation program to
evaluate how the train would have behaved under various conditions,
the spokesman said.
   One locomotive recorder revealed that engineers began braking
10{ miles before the train jumped the tracks and had applied
emergency brakes eight miles before the crash, but the train
continued to pick up speed.
   Shortly before the crash, a crew member radioed an emergency
distress call that the train was out of control at 90 mph.
   Investigators expected to spend about a week surveying the
wreckage, Lopatkiewicz said.
   Six homes were leveled and five others damaged by freight cars
and mounds of the sandy potash component.
   Also killed were stepbrothers Jason H. Thompson, 9, and Tyson
White, 7, whose home was buried beneath a stack of box cars.
   Eight people were treated for injuries, including three other
members of the crew.

<HEAD>State, Federal Officials Sign Hanford Cleanup Pact</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and federal officials today signed
an agreement launching a 30-year program to clean up millions of
gallons of waste produced over 45 years at the Hanford nuclear
reservation.
   Gov. Booth Gardner's office also announced a 14-month
investigation to determine if the generation of liquid waste from a
Hanford plutonium processing plant should be halted sooner than
planned.
   The pact was signed after changes were made to cover cleanup of
any hazardous waste that occurs when eight closed reactors are
decommissioned.
   The changes in the agreement were disclosed as Gardner and
representatives of the U.S. Department of Energy and Environmental
Protection Agency signed the pact.
   ``This agreement means that, at long last, we can begin a
massive effort to clean up the 45 years of accumulated chemical and
nuclear wastes at Hanford,'' Gardner said.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins, in a letter, said cleanup was
``of utmost importance.''
   ``The agreement properly emphasizes the priority the department
must attach to (environmental) compliance and cleanup efforts at
Hanford,'' Watkins wrote.
   Robie Russell, regional administrator of EPA, called the
agreement a model for other DOE facilities across the nation.
   The agreement sets up a 30-year program to clean up millions of
gallons of chemical and radioactive wastes that are a byproduct of
45 years of plutonium production at Hanford.
   But the agreement does not include the money to do the job,
which must be appropriated by Congress. The costs for the job has
been estimated at up to $50 billion.
   Although originally intended to include a commitment of $2.8
billion for the first five years of cleanup, Watkins said recently
he has no power to commit the Bush administration to that level of
funding.
   The Bush administration has proposed spending $367 million in
1990 for waste management and environmental restoration at Hanford.
   With 5 billion cubic yards of waste, the 560-square-mile Hanford
reservation is the DOE's most contaminated production site. The
agreement calls for the cleanup to be completed by the year 2018.

   Dave Melancon lost his sight in a 1986 home
accident that should have ended his 10-year career as a hair
stylist.
   ``But I'm headstrong and very independent,'' Melancon recalled
at An Eye For Hair, the salon he opened in March.
   Melancon, 40, was blinded after falling onto a metal sculpture
he was making. But two former customers convinced him he could
still cut hair.
   ``They called me and said nobody cut their hair like I had and
wanted me to try,'' he said. ``They came to my home and it came out
all right.''
   Melancon won a $35,000 grant from the state to go into business.
He has six sighted hairdressers working for him and about 10
regular customers for himself.
   ``I feel from the scalp to the end of the hair and listen to the
scissors. My hearing and sense of touch are more acute now. I'm not
scissor-happy,'' he said.
   One customer, Robert Ward, said, ``I kept promising him I'd let
him cut my hair. He's such a nice guy. I finally gave in.''
   ``I called my regular barber and said, `Don't you go anywhere.
I'm having this blind guy cut my hair. When I'm finished, I want
you to fix it,''' Word said.
   But after Melancon was finished, Word said, he phoned his barber
again to say, ``I think I'm going to replace you.''

   Du Pont Pharmaceuticals announced Monday it
has won Food and Drug Administration approval for a preservative
that triples the time livers and pancreases can be kept alive
outside the body before transplant.
   The company and scientists that developed the solution say it
will allow more of these organs to be transplanted and give doctors
more time to find the best match for recipients, ensuring greater
chances the patient will survive.
   While previously livers had to be transplanted within 10 hours
and pancreases within eight hours of being removed from a donor,
livers preserved in Du Pont's solution can be kept alive for more
than 30 hours and pancreases up to 28 hours, said Dr. Folkert
Belzer of the University of Wisconsin.
   The solution also can preserve kidneys for up to 40 hours, the
same amount of time as conventional methods, said Belzer, a
professor of surgery, who led the team of University of Wisconsin
researchers who developed the solution.
   The new preservative, tested in clinical trials at hospitals and
transplant centers throughout the country, ``has now allowed us the
same safe preservation time for the liver and the pancreas which
was previously only available for the kidney,'' Belzer said at a
news conference with Du Pont officials.
   The result, he said, is that transplantations of these organs
don't require the haste and urgency previously needed. This
improves the safety of the transplant surgery since it can be
scheduled with a full, well-rested staff, and assures better
functioning organs after transplant.
   The result is better post-operative recovery, which reduces
hospital time for the patient and lowers the overall cost of the
operation, Belzer said.
   The average hospital stay previously was six weeks for liver and
pancreas transplant patients, but Belzer's solution reduced that to
about 20 days, including one or two days in intensive care, he said.
   Also, longer preservation time allows patients to wait at home,
sometimes more than 1,000 miles from a transplant center, for a
donor to be found, instead of having to relocate temporarily, often
far away from their families, to an area near a center.
   Though officials say there remains a critical shortage of organs
for transplant, extending the time they can be preserved will
ensure that fewer are ``wasted,'' said Joseph Mollica, vice
president of Du Pont Pharmaceuticals.
   Last year, 9,123 kidney transplants, 1,680 liver transplants and
243 pancreas transplants were performed in the United States,
according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, based in
Richmond, Va.
   However, about 14,850 people are currently waiting for kidney
transplants, 738 are waiting for liver transplants and 223 people
are waiting pancreas transplants, according to the network.
   The preservative was developed with financing by the National
Institutes of Health and Du Pont. It will be available on a
commercial basis beginning June 1, company officials said.
   Researchers also are testing to determine whether the solution
or a modification of it can extend the life of hearts and lungs for
transplant.

<HEAD>Soviets Start Withdrawing from Mongolia</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Summit, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trainloads of Soviet tanks and artillery started
leaving Mongolia's border with China on Monday, the same day
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived in Beijing for the first
Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   A Soviet Defense Ministry spokesman said the timing of the two
events was coincidental.
   Maj. Gen. Yuri Markelov said the pullout is the second stage of
a partial withdrawal from Mongolia that in the next two years will
involve 50,000 troops. That is about 75 percent of the force that
has patrolled the border since the 1960s, when relations between
the Soviet Union and China reached their lowest point.
   ``Now we don't have such conditions,'' Markelov said at a news
briefing.
   The withdrawal is part of the overall reduction of 500,000
Soviet troops that Gorbachev promised the United Nations in
December.
   ``About 50,000 servicemen, 5,000 tanks, 1,000 infantry vehicles,
190 aircraft and 130 helicopter gunships will be withdrawn from
Mongolia,'' Markelov said.
   The official Tass news agency said more than 820 artillery
systems will be dismantled.
   It said the pullout ``has been brought about by new political
thinking and better relations in the region.''
   Last year, an infantry division was withdrawn from Mongolia,
Markelov said. This year, a tank division and other military units
will be pulled out and next year, one infantry division and one
tank division will be recalled, he said.
   ``The troops were stationed in Mongolia at the request of the
government and the withdrawal is also at the request of the
Mongolian government,'' he said. ``Mongolia is a sovereign country
and can determine itself the degree of security that is needed.''
   He said there had been one serious clash between Soviet and
Chinese troops in 1969 and several minor incidents, but he said he
did not have exact data or casualty figures.
   The Soviet Union began withdrawing troops from Hungary on April
25 and cuts are expected to begin shortly in East Germany and
Czechoslovakia.

   Actress Kim Basinger is joking her way
around rumors about whether her purchase of this small Georgia town
for $20 million means it will become the site of a movie production
company or tourist center.
   ``See, I want it to be like Dollywood,'' she said in an
interview in June's issue of Vanity Fair magazine. ``What do you
think of the name Kimwood?''
   Ms. Basinger, a 35-year-old native of nearby Athens, bought
Braselton, population 500, in March with a group of investors.
Specifically, they bought the town's water and sewer system, an
industrial park, a shopping center, a few small businesses and
about 50 homes, all of which had been owned by the Braselton family.
   ``I'm Big Daddy now. I mean, I'm Big Mama. I just bought me a
town,'' she said. ``I'm Barbara Stanwyck in the `Big Valley.' Me
and my 1,800 acres.''
   Ms. Basinger has been in such movies as ``The Natural'' and ``9{

   Friends of Terry Rakolta, a
suburban mother whose complaints about a TV show she felt was too
racy led some advertisers to withdraw sponsorship, say she has
handled the attention well.
   Rakolta, 44, established Americans for Responsible Television
after denouncing the Fox show ``Married ... With Children'' as
hostile to family values.
   She has since appeared on numerous news and talk shows to oppose
sex and violence on television.
   Friends say Rakolta's concern for her family gives her the
strength to take on the networks. ``There are certain things she
cares very much about,'' said Suzy Farbman, a friend for 15 years.
``She's like a mother lion.''
   Rakolta said her sister, Ronna Romney, a Republican Party
activist who is married to the son of former Gov. George Romney,
helped prepare her for the spotlight.

<HEAD>Diplomatic Dispute Over Use of Word ``Murderers'' in U.S. Statement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A diplomatic dispute has developed between the
United States and South Korea over use of the word ``murderers'' in
a State Department condemnation of the death of a South Korean
student.
   South Korean diplomats have asked the United States to explain
its comments, made last week in response to reporters' queries
about the death of Lee Chol-kyu in the southern city of Kwangju.
   Students opposed to the government of Roh Tae-woo, who have been
conducting protests to demand an investigation of Lee's death,
claim authorities killed the student dissident and distorted
results of his autopsy.
   Doctors reported finding signs that Lee had drowned, but they
said their autopsy, conducted under supervision of college
professors and opposition lawmakers, did not show any sign of
torture.
   The State Department last week called Lee's death ``a deplorable
event. We do not know who may have committed this atrocious act.''
   The statement said President Roh had called for a full
investigation of the case ``and we hope the murderers will be
exposed and severely punished.''
   South Korea ``contacted us'' after the statement appeared in
several of Korean newspapers, said a U.S. official. ``They asked
for a correction,'' said the official, who spoke on condition he
not be named.
   At the department's daily briefing for reporters Monday, a
Korean journalist asked whether the United States plans to retract
the word ``murderers.''
   Deputy State Department spokesman Richard Boucher responded that
``we, of course, do not intend to prejudge the outcome of the
investigation.''
   Pressed again, Boucher said, ``I'm not taking a position on how
the tragic death occurred.''
   Lee Sang Kyu, a spokesman for the South Korean Embassy, said it
was ``very unusual'' for the State Department to issue such a
statement. ``We told them they were prejudging the results,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Reformers Win More Parliamentary Seats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reformers won more seats in the new Soviet
parliament in a second round of voting, according to results
released Monday, with the most resounding victory going to a
criminal investigator who alleged corruption at the highest levels.
   Prosecutor Nikolai Ivanov won the Leningrad seat in Sunday's
election with 61 percent of the vote against 33 opponents, two days
after saying in a televised debate that his investigation touched
on Politburo member Yegor Ligachev. He made no specific charge.
   But pro-democracy activists in the Soviet Union's second-largest
city opposed Ivanov, saying he used Stalinist methods in his
investigations.
   Other victors were reformers barred from the ballot on their
first try, including editor Vitaly Korotich, whose magazine Ogonyok
has infuriated conservatives with sensational reports on the past
and present.
   The reformers' success continued a trend started in the first
round of elections March 26, which were the first nationwide
multicandidate elections in the Soviet Union in 70 years. Repeat
elections were held in 195 districts where voters were given a
choice of only one or two candidates on March 26, and more than 50
percent refused to elect anyone.
   Candidates backed by the pro-democracy People's Fronts in
Estonia, Latvia and the Ukraine claimed victories. People's Front
officials in Latvia said their candidates won five of the six races
there.
   Korotich was tossed off the ballot in Moscow in the first round
by an election commission stacked with party hard-liners. He was
elected this time in the supposedly conservative city of Kharkov in
the Ukraine with about 80 percent of the vote against nine other
candidates, said Lyudmilla Merko, assistant director of Kharkov's
electoral commission.
   Ivanov became the focus of debate in the closing days of the
campaign in Leningrad, as the democracy-oriented coalition that
defeated top party officials in the first round mounted a campaign
against the front-runner. Ivanov was calling for a national
commission to investigate corruption, but his opponents said he
would use illegal methods to coerce confessions.
   Ivanov and his partner, Telman Gdlyan, are famous throughout the
Soviet Union for a lengthy investigation of corruption in the
republic of Uzbekistan. Gdlyan won a parliamentary seat in March in
Moscow.
   Gdlyan reportedly gave a 45-minute speech on high-level
corruption at a closed meeting of the newly elected Moscow deputies
on May 3, and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev reacted by suggesting
that he had better be right.
   ``I hope you sleep tonight,'' Gorbachev said, according to
several people at the meeting. ``If you are right, that's one
thing, but if you are lying, this will not turn out to be the best
day of your life.''
   On Saturday, the Presidium, the country's highest executive
body, attacked Ivanov and Gdlyan in the party newspaper Pravda,
accusing them of interfering with an investigation into their
alleged abuses of power.
   The Soviet Supreme Court also has demanded that the Soviet
Procurator General's Office investigate whether Gdlyan should
remain on the job because of a botched investigation of an eminent
Estonian scientist. The scientist died in jail, and the court
earlier this month overturned his conviction.
   Several key conservatives lost Sunday, including Anatoly Ivanov,
editor of the monthly Molodaya Gvardia. The journal is noted for
such articles as this month's interview with Josef Stalin's
agriculture minister, who defended the purges of the 1930s as
necessary even though millions were killed.
   The Molodaya Gvardia editor lost in the monastery town of
Zagorsk. Journalists Alexander Bovin and Alexander Krutov moved
into a run-off election scheduled for Sunday. The quick turn-around
will allow winners to take their seats when the new Congress of
People's Deputies opens May 25.
   Latvian prosecutor Janis Djdnitis, a hardliner voted most
unpopular Latvian in a poll by a youth newspaper last year,
received 6 percent of the vote in a Riga district. Reformer
Maveriks Vulfsons won, said Janis Trikulis, a television editor.
   Klara Hallik, a college lecturer on ethnic relations backed by
the Estonian People's Front, defeated both the editor of a
Communist Party youth magazine and a student who called for
withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Baltic.
   A leader of the Ukrainian People's Front, economist Vladimir
Chernyak, advanced to the run-off against Vitaly Karpenko, editor
of the official newspaper Vecherny Kiev, said Lydia Voronova, a
Kiev election official.
   In Moscow, one reformer won and another lost.
   Olympic weight-lifting champion Yuri Vlasov, considered to have
a radical platform, advanced to the second round along with
journalist V. Shinkaretsky in the Lublinsky region. But glasnost
champion and playwright Mikhail Shatrov lost in the Kuntsovsky
district to Afghanistan war hero Alexander Rudskoy and a
Moskovskaya Pravda editor, V. Logunov. Those two advance to the
run-off.
   In Tashkent in Central Asia, Moslem leader mufti Muhammad-Sakyk
Ibn Muhammad-Yusuf was elected.
   In the March election, voters embarrassed dozens of Communist
Party and government officials by denying them seats in the new
parliament. Candidate Politburo member Yuri F. Solovyov ran
unopposed in one Leningrad district and still lost.
   Most of those who lost in March did not run again.
   In three districts of Armenia elections were held Sunday because
fewer than half the voters went to the polls in March. In one
district a repeat election was held because the winner died shortly
after being elected.

   Soviet TV news was 30 minutes into a lifeless
report on President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to China when it
switched from reporting formal greetings on Monday to photographs
of 150,000 demonstrators.
   The report did not explain that the protesters at Beijing's
Tiananmen Square are seeking a more democratic society, even though
that is one of Gorbachev's stated goals for the Soviet Union.
   The first half hour of coverage featured several minutes of
reporters' backs and Gorbachev's plane arriving in the distance,
and more than a minute of the Soviet national anthem punctuated by
an artillery salute.
   But then the camera switched to scenes of teeming Chinese
streets, and the reporter noted, ``By tradition, the ceremony of
meeting a high-ranking guest takes place on the steps of the Great
Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square.
   ``But life sometimes differs from diplomatic protocol,'' the
reporter continued. ``Today, the square looked like this.''
   Cameras then focused on masses of demonstrators calmly packed
into the square.
   Since nearly all their signs were in Chinese, it was difficult
for Soviet viewers to understand the point of the protest.
   However, one banner said in Russian, ``Welcome to the initiator
of glasnost.'' Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness in the
media, is one Chinese protesters want their own leaders to adopt.
   Further comments and interviews with Chinese citizens all
concentrated on improving Chinese-Soviet relations.
   ``The Chinese people welcome Gorbachev from the bottom of our
hearts and souls,'' said one man.
   The evening newspaper Izvestia said Chinese students have been
protesting recently but said nothing about the welcoming ceremony
for Gorbachev being switched from the Great Hall of the People to a
nearby site. Gorbachev's motorcade route also was changed and his
meeting with President Yang Shangkun delayed because of the protest.
   Most Soviet coverage of the summit, the first between a Chinese
and Soviet leader in 30 years, concentrated on improving relations
between the superpowers. Izvestia and Soviet TV also reported that
other nations welcomed the rapprochement.
   Gorbachev's statement that the Kremlin has been partly to blame
for three decades of bad feeling was not reported.

   Customs agents replaced $500 million worth of
cocaine hidden in a barbed-wire shipment with sand, but the
smugglers got wise and never picked up the shipment from a
warehouse, officials said Monday.
   The 5,175 pounds of cocaine in two 40-foot boxes represented the
largest seizure ever in the five-state South Central Region and one
of the two or three largest in the country, said J. Robert Grimes,
Customs regional commissioner.
   Agents discovered the cocaine in a shipment from Ecuador in
January, replaced it and watched it at a warehouse until April 26,
when agents realized the smugglers had broken in under their noses,
said FBI agent Ruben Monzon.
   ``Whoever it was cut a hole in the cement roof and broke into
the container. There was no way our agents could have seen them,''
Monzon said.
   ``We think that we will, through our investigation, be able to
identify the people behind this.''
   Grimes said the case was the third major drug seizure in the New
Orleans area in nine months.
   ``What that says is that there is a lot coming in here,'' he
said.

   Eight explorers caught a
ride back to civilization on Monday after walking to the North Pole
to call attention to the threats facing its fragile ecology.
   Three aircraft met the adventurers at the North Pole and carried
them to Eureka, where they were to travel to a larger plane to
their base camp in Resolute by late Monday.
   Bad weather prevented a plane from picking up the team after it
reached the North Pole on Sunday, said Wendy White, an expedition
spokesman in Ottawa. But aircraft and support team caught up with
the explorers on Monday.
   The international expedition _ called Icewalk _ planted a U.N.
flag at the North Pole at 4:38 a.m. EDT on Sunday, organizers said.
   ``It's enough to know we've done it,'' British explorer Robert
Swan, Icewalk's leader, said in a message sent out by radio and
released here. ``But it's not over yet, not until we are out of
here.''
   The team included Darryl Roberts, 23, of New York City, who
organizers said is the first American to walk to the North Pole.
Swan, who walked to the South Pole with two other men in 1986,
became the first man to walk to both poles.
   The adventurers left Cape Aldrich on Ellesmere Island in
Canada's Northwest Territories on March 20. They made their journey
to draw attention to the environmental hazards such as pollution
and the global warming that are facing the fragile Arctic.
   The expedition was hampered by warmer than expected spring
temperatures that produced some open water.
   The expedition covered a 457-mile direct route, but making a way
through the ice and drift along the way made it closer to a
620-mile trek.
   Icewalk has a high-power public relations operation promoting it
and corporate sponsorship supporting its $4 million budget.
   It differs from other Arctic expeditions because it uses only
human power to travel and take supplies along in sledges carrying
some 250 pounds of cargo each. They don't use dogsleds or
skimobiles.
   The Icewalk team includes eight men from Britain, Canada, the
United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, Australia and West Germany.

<TEXT>
   Non-prescription sunglass companies will be
shedding light on their eyewear with Food and Drug Administration
approval Monday of a uniform labeling system.
   The labeling, which is voluntary, will tell consumers how much
protection over-the-counter sunglasses provide from harmful
ultraviolet light.
   Information on ultraviolet, or UV, rays generally has not been
available for non-prescription sunglasses, and the FDA said price
and darkness of lens does not guarantee UV protection.
   The labeling will provide consumers with uniform information on
the protection provided from both UVA and shorter wave-length UVB
rays and will recommend uses depending on the amount of protection.
   Excessive exposure to ultraviolet light can cause a painful
injury called photokeratitis, which is similar to snow blindness
and has been associated with cataracts, which cloud the lens of the
eye, and damage to the retina.
   The labeling was developed by the Sunglass Association of
America and the FDA.
   Under the labeling system, sunglasses that block at least 70
percent of sunlight UVB, 20 percent of UVA radiation and 60 percent
of visible light will be recommended as ``cosmetic'' sunglasses for
around-town use.
   ``General purpose'' sunglasses block 95 percent of UVB rays, at
least 60 percent of UVA radiation and from 60 percent to 92 percent
of visible light, under the labeling system. Their shades range
from medium to dark and are recommended for use in a sunny
environment, such as boating, driving, flying or hiking.
   Sunglasses classified as ``special purpose'' block at least 99
percent of UVB, 60 percent UVA and 97 percent of visible light, and
are recommended for use in bright sunshine, such as on ski slopes
and tropical beaches.
   The FDA warned that sunglasses should not be used for protection
against UV from tanning lamps or other artificial tanning sources.
Special goggles are required for protection from the penetrating UV
light in these sources.

flags bearing pictures of a smiling Menem, with shoulder-length
hair and muttonchop sideburns, reminiscent of a 19th century
political caudillo.
   Not a necktie was in sight as factory workers and gauchos _
cowboys from the rich pampas _ sang the Peronist anthem: ``Peron,
Peron, how great you are.''
   Menem's election ``is a return to our roots,'' said truck driver
Alejandro Galindez, 27, as he and his girlfriend joined the
flag-waving crowd.
   Menem has addressed only vaguely how he might pull Argentina,
once one of the world's wealthiest nations, from its 35 percent
monthly inflation, $59 billion foreign debt, unemployment and
social tensions.
   In his victory speech, he called for ``national unity'' and
urged ``the forces of production, businessmen, farmers, workers,
everyone,'' to put aside differences and ``set the country in
motion.''
   Menem pledged to put an end to ``the Argentina where some live
well doing nothing and others live badly although they work all
day.''
   As he spoke, Menem was flanked by his wife, Zulema, 46, daughter
Maria Eva, 17, and son, Carlos, 21.
   Menem, who likes to drive race cars and be photographed with
showgirls, was born and raised in La Rioja, a poor, arid and
sparsely populated province of 200,000 some 688 miles northwest of
Buenos Aires. The principal products are olives, grapes and jojoba.
   The son of Syrian immigrants who came to Argentina early in the
century and built a prosperous vinyard and winery, Menem was
educated in provincial public schools.
   Graduating from law school in 1955, one of Menem's first cases
was the defense of Peronists arrested following the military ouster
of Peron in September 1955.
   Although the Peronist party was barred from political activity,
Menem's law office quickly became a provincial Peronist meeting
place and he was arrested for participation in a political
demonstration.
   A natural showman, Menem's star rose rapidly and after almost
two decades of work with the party, he was elected to the first of
his three terms as governor of La Rioja in 1973.
   Although his parents were Moslems, Menem converted in 1964 to
Roman Catholicism, the religion of most Argentines and required by
the constitution for all presidents. His wife, also of Syrian
origin, has said she prefers to remain a Moslem.
   ``It's easy for me to communicate with people,'' Menem has said.
``I talk with everyone. I feel at home in the most humble places.''

<HEAD>Poland, Hungary Compare Notes On Political Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth of Hungary
said Monday that Poland has taken the lead in political reforms but
that his country was ahead of its Warsaw Pact ally in reforming the
economy.
   Nemeth met with Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and had ``deep'' discussions on
ways to achieve democratic reforms, Nemeth told a news conference.
   ``What was very useful to me was to learn about the experiences
of the Polish hosts in the preparation for the switch over to
pluralism,'' said Nemeth, who arrived Sunday for his 24-hour trip.
   Pluralism is a word often used by East bloc officials to signify
democracy.
   The Hungarian leader said the Polish government's accord with
the Solidarity-led opposition were a ``historic event.''
   The April 5 pact resulted in the legalization of the independent
trade union after a seven-year ban and provide for partially
democratic elections in June to the National Assembly.
   Nemeth said that Hungary was ahead of Poland in implementing
economic reforms, such as reducing state subsidies to enterprises.
He called for more joint ventures between the two countries. But he
said Poland had taken the lead politically.
   When asked if the two sides had discussed the situation in East
Germany and Czechoslovakia, East Block nations that are resisting
reform, Nemeth said the ``leadership of each country is responsible
to its own people.''
   But he criticized Hungary's neighbor Romania for its treatment
of Hungarian, German and other minorities.
   ``Hungarian-Romanian relations in the last year have
deteriorated due to no fault of ours,'' Nemeth said when asked if
the two sides had discussed Romania.
   He said Romania does not guarantee its citizens ``basic human
and civil rights'' and that little progress had been made in
settling their differences.
   Hungary and Poland are the two East bloc countries that have
responded most aggressively to opportunities provided by Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's calls for greater openness and economic
restructuring.

<HEAD>Landmark Agreement Is Signed For Radioactive Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and federal officials signed a
landmark 30-year agreement Monday to clean up radioactive and
hazardous waste at the Hanford nuclear reservation, the
government's most contaminated weapons complex.
   A citizens group charged that the pact doesn't provide the money
to do the job.
   With 5 billion cubic yards of waste, the 560-square-mile Hanford
reservation is the U.S. Department of Energy's most contaminated
weapons production site. Hanford produced much of the plutonium for
the nation's nuclear weapons arsenal.
   Estimates of the cost of cleaning up wastes that date to the
World War II Manhattan Project run to $50 billion.
   Ken Morgan, a DOE spokesman in Richland, said the agency has
agreed to seek the money to meet milestones in the agreement but
hasn't set specific figures.
   The agreement calls for removing billions of gallons of
radioactive waste, with work to be completed by the year 2018.
   Key items include disposing of more than 14 million gallons of
waste by converting it into a concrete-like substance by 1994;
removing liquid waste from dozens of old storage tanks, many of
which have leaked, by 1995, and building a $1 billion plant to
convert radioactive waste into a glass-like substance for shipment
to a national high-level waste dump by 1999.
   ``This agreement means that, at long last, we can begin a
massive effort to clean up the 45 years of accumulated chemical and
nuclear wastes at Hanford,'' said Gov. Booth Gardner.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins, in a letter, said cleanup
agreement ``properly emphasizes the priority the department must
attach to (environmental) compliance and cleanup efforts at
Hanford.''
   But critics said the agreement doesn't guarantee Congress will
appropriate the money.
   ``This is fertile ground for cynicism,'' said Jim Thomas of the
Spokane-based Hanford Education Action League. ``Without
congressional support for money ... the agreement is not worth the
paper it's written on.''
   The Bush administration has proposed spending $367 million in
1990 for waste management and environmental restoration at Hanford.
   The last plutonium reactor at Hanford was shut down last year,
but several plants at Hanford are still processing irradiated fuel
stockpiles into nuclear weapons material. The stockpile is expected
to be exhausted by the mid-1990s.

<HEAD>Governing Party Resumes Effort to Find New Prime Minister</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party resumed efforts Monday to find
a new prime minister after its first choice refused to step in for
Noboru Takeshita, who is resigning over an influence-peddling
scandal.
   The refusal Saturday by Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the party's
Executive Council and a former foreign minister, left the Liberal
Democratic Party with no clear choice for a Takeshita successor.
   In rejecting persistent requests, Ito said party leaders lacked
a ``sense of crisis'' about the party's plunging public support. He
said he was not confident he could carry out ``political and party
reforms needed'' to reverse public distrust
   He also cited his age, 75, and his health problems with diabetes.
   Takeshita said he would resign as soon as the fiscal 1989 budget
passes Parliament, expected by late May.
   Senior governing party members who ordinarily would be in a
position to succeed him as party leader, and thus prime minister,
also have been tainted by donations or links to stock profit
windfalls from the company at the center of the scandal.
   The party seeks a leader with a clean reputation, such as Ito,
to help improve its image before elections in July or August for
half the seats in Parliament's upper house.
   Liberal Democratic Party Deputy Secretary General Ryutaro
Hashimoto met Monday with senior leaders of the party to ask their
opinions on how to proceed.
   Officials said some possible candidates were mentioned, but none
appeared strong enough to win the party's unanimous support. Among
them:
   _ Toshio Komoto, 77, a veteran lawmaker and former government
minister who sought the prime minister's job in 1982 and lost to
Yasuhiro Nakasone, Takeshita's predecessor.
   _ Michita Sakata, 72, a former House of Representatives speaker.
Sakata already has said he would reject the top government job.
   _ Shin Kanamaru, 74, known for behind-the-scenes negotiations
with opposition parties over legislation on behalf of the Nakasone
and Takeshita administrations.
   _ Masaharu Gotoda, 74, former chief Cabinet secretary and
director general of the National Police Agency. As the head of the
party's political reform committee, he is seen as suited to lead
reform efforts.
   _ Toshiki Kaifu, 58, a former education minister who once was
seen as a rising star in the party.
   _ Party Deputy Secretary General Hashimoto, 51, a former
transport minister thrust into the spotlight when he was put in
charge of the effort to find the next prime minister. In the
search, he is filling in for Secretary General Shintaro Abe, who in
the the hospital to undergo surgery for gall stones.
   Abe also is among those linked to the scandal involving the
Recruit Co., an information services and publishing comglomerate
accused of trying to influence government decisions.
   Three of Takeshita's Cabinet ministers have resigned because of
links to Recruit, and 14 bureaucrats and businessmen have been
arrested on bribery and other charges in connection with sales of
bargain-priced, unlisted stock in a Recruit subsidiary. The stock
soared in value after public listing, and the buyers profited
handsomely.

   An unmarried Pakistani man, an Iranian
mother living in West Germany and a bachelor from Kuwait were
announced Monday as among 20,000 winners of a ticket to the
American dream.
   The lucky winners of the State Department's first ``visa
lottery'' randomly granting entry into the United States were
chosen earlier by computer from among 3.2 million foreign
applicants for U.S. immigrant visas in March.
   ``I can't imagine another country opening up its borders for
this kind of opportunity,'' said Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif.
and the chief House sponsor of the legislation that created the
lottery last fall.
   During a modest ceremony in a private computer firm's cinder
block warehouse in this Washington suburb, Berman opened three
lottery winners' envelopes selected at random from long rows of
blue-faced file cabinets.
   The first winner, he said, was a 36-year-old man without wife or
children from the Pakistani village of Khazana. The Pakistani
Embassy said there are two villages named Khazana, both near the
northwestern border with Afghanistan.
   The second envelope opened by Berman yielded the application
form of a 45-year-old woman from Iran, now living in West Germany
with her only child. The third winner was identified as a single,
27-year-old Kuwaiti man.
   The winners' names will be kept secret until they are officially
notified by the nearest U.S. diplomatic post in their home
countries. The process could take several months, officials said.
   ``If they haven't heard by October, they should know they
haven't been selected,'' said Frances Jones of the State
Department's Consular Affairs Office.
   Visas for the 20,000 winners will be effective over the next two
years, 10,000 for entry in the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1
and the remaining 10,000 in fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1, 1990.
   Notice of the visa lottery, which was relayed to citizens of 162
foreign countries by radio, television, newspaper and even
messengers riding outrigger canoes, produced scenes resembling
riots at some U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, from
Senegal to Sicily and Morocco to Malaysia.
   In Cairo, the embassy was forced to shut down and police were
summoned to handle a crowd of 2,000 seeking visa information. The
embassy in Dacca, Bangladesh, reported that everyone from
university professors to rickshaw drivers inquired about applying.
Officials in Casablanca, Morocco, distributed 5,000 information
sheets in three days.
   Berman said the overwhelming response during the month-long
application period in March was testimony to ``where the American
dream stands for the people of the world.''
   Berman, who represents Los Angeles, said his father, Joseph
Berman, 81, immigrated from Poland in 1920, got a degree from New
York University and settled in California in the 1930s as a textile
wholesaler to clothing manufacturers. The elder Berman still lives
in Orange County, Calif.
   Berman's legislation was intended to improve the geographical
balance among immigrants. Current law, which imposes an annual
ceiling of 270,000 immigrants worldwide, favors certain countries
such as Mexico, Korea, India and the Philippines because preference
is given to applicants whose relatives already live in the United
States.
   The visa lottery was open to virtually anyone except those from
13 countries that used more than 5,000 immigrant slots each last
year.
   The lottery winners are not covered by the 270,000 immigrant
ceiling. But they still must satisfy the same basic eligibility
requirements that apply to all prospective immigrants.
   Anyone with a dangerous contagious disease, a criminal
conviction or membership in the Communist Party or other forbidden
political organizations will be excluded.
   Those who are awarded a visa and enter the United States can
apply for citizenship later if they meet strict criteria, Ms. Jones
said.

<HEAD>Thousands Reject Autopsy Results on Student's Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of demonstrators marched
Monday for a third day in southern Kwangju city demanding an
independent investigation into the death of a dissident student
whom authorities say drowned.
   Opposition parties called Monday for a parliamentary inquiry to
dispel doubts about the death of Lee Chol-kyu, whose body was found
Wednesday in a reservoir near Kwangju.
   Students and dissidents allege that Lee, 24, was tortured and
killed by police.
   Witnesses said 10,000 demonstrators marched through Kwangju
after a campus rally against President Roh Tae-woo that was joined
by professors at Chosun University.
   Scuffles erupted when the protesters, yelling ``Down with Roh
Tae-woo!'' tried to force their way past police lines to reach the
provincial government headquarters, witnesses said.
   But riot police wielded shields and truncheons to disperse the
protesters. No injuries or arrests were reported.
   In Seoul, about 300 radical student leaders began a four-day
hunger strike Monday, demanding a full and independent
investigation.
   Students threatened to stage nationwide protests, beginning
Thursday, unless they get a full explanation of Lee's death.
   They accused authorities of distorting pathology tests.
   Doctors reported Sunday finding ``a lot of plankton'' in Lee's
intestines. ``The findings indisputably indicate that the student
died by drowning,'' said Yoon Joong-jin, director of the National
Institute of Scientific Investigation.
   Yoon said independent medical college professors and opposition
lawmakers witnessed the tests. Doctors also have said an autopsy
showed no sign of torture.
   Hundreds of posters rejecting the findings were plastered on
notice boards of buildings in Kwangju, which Thursday marks the
anniversary of a 1980 civil uprising in which 200 civilians were
killed.
   Thousands of students and citizens in Kwangju have staged daily
protests against Roh's government since Lee's body was found. The
student had been sought by police for anti-government activities.
   Lee's death comes as authorities step up a crackdown on
dissidents. About 230 radical students and dissidents have been
arrested since early April.
   Government officials accused dissidents of trying to use Lee's
death as a rallying point for their anti-government campaign, which
has failed to gain public support because of their extreme views
and violence.

   Iraqi archaeologists have unearthed a

discovered, the official Iraqi News Agency reported Monday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted archaeologists as
saying the settlement was located 20 miles south of Nineveh in
northern Iraq.
   The community consisted of two circular brick houses, each about
3 yards high and 6 yards in diameter.
   The archaeologists also found animal statues that may have been
used in rituals, the agency said.
   The same team discovered a similar community in the Nemrik area,
22 miles from Nineveh, dating to 7000 B.C., the agency said.

<HEAD>Baker Says Soviets Now ``Singing Out of Our Hymn Book''</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Soviet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said on
Monday the changes taking place in the Soviet Union are real and
``truly revolutionary'' and that Soviet leaders are now ``singing
out of our hymn book.''
   Baker also said that he believes the West has nothing to fear
from warmer relations between the Soviet Union and China which he
said could enhance world stability.
   But Baker also said that the Soviets' unilateral reductions in
short-range nuclear arms in Europe announced during his
conversations in Moscow last week with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev represent only ``a very small step.''
   ``This is something the United States has been wanting the
Soviets to do for a very long time,'' Baker said, noting the
significant imbalance in such weapons between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact.
   But he faulted Gorbachev's proposal as failing to offer to
dismantle or destroy the 500 short-range missiles involved, ``or
even to take them out of Europe.''
   He said that while they will be pulled out of the territory of
Warsaw Pact nations, they will remain in new positions in the
European part of the Soviet Union.
   Commenting in an appearance on Capitol Hill before a constituent
forum sponsored by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., Baker said the
significance of his Moscow meetings is that the United States is
now ``re-engaged with the Soviets'' across the entire spectrum of
issues facing the two superpowers.
   During a three-hour meeting with Baker last Thursday, Gorbachev
outlined at length his plans for restructuring the Soviet economy
and the difficulties he is encountering.
   Baker was effusive in hailing that restructuring in comments
that appeared significantly less restrained than his
somewhat-guarded approach earlier in the Bush administration.
   ``What is going on in the Soviet Union is truly revolutionary
when you consider the economic and political system they have had
for the last 70 years,'' Baker said.
   ``It's light years away from where they were a few years ago,''
he said. ``It's important to recognize that what is going on is
real.''
   But Baker again cautioned that the success of change in the
Soviet system rests not on what the West can do to help but on how
Soviet citizens respond to ``what is really fundamental change.''
   He said again that the West should conduct normal two-way trade
with the Soviets but should not subsidize it in any way.
   Responding to questions, Baker was asked why the United States
is not responding more fully to Gorbachev's foreign policy
initiatives but is instead ``waiting to see what happens.''
   ``I would argue with you that we are not just waiting,'' Baker
replied.
   ``Generally speaking we have re-engaged across the full range of
issues. The Russians are coming our way. They're singing out of our
hymn book.''
   ``They are unilaterally reducing'' military forces, he said.
``We've been calling on them to do this for years. ... They're
saying that their economic and political system has failed. They're
having elections. They're trying to open up politically and
economically.
   ``Clearly they are coming in our direction and we ought to
welcome that,'' Baker said.
   ``But don't let down our guard,'' he added.
   Asked about Gorbachev's summit meeting in Beijing, the first
such event in 30 years, Baker said he does not believe it
represents a threat to Western interests.
   ``I don't see the risk of a rapprochement of the type that took
place years ago when the Chinese and the Soviets were pretty much
in opposition to the United States,'' he said.
   ``I think it could be healthy for world stability,'' he said of
the meeting. ``It helps to remove troops from either side of the
Sino-Soviet border.
   ``I don't think we should be worried about the visit and we in
fact are not,'' Baker said.

   Three blacks were stabbed to
death in factional fighting in Natal Province and three others were
injured in two hand-grenade attacks in Soweto, police said Monday.
   The three men were killed over the weekend in gang attacks in
black areas near the Indian Ocean port of Durban and nearby
Pietermaritzburg, the Natal provincial capital, Pretoria police
said in a daily unrest report.
   Factional fighting has persisted in the region despite repeated
urgings by police and black leaders to end the violence.
   The fighting grew from nationwide black protests against the
apartheid system of race-segregation in 1984-86. More than 1,000
blacks have died in Natal in skirmishes over local issues or
between rival political groups fighting apartheid.
   Police said two grenades were thrown Sunday at the home of Steve
Nkantlo, mayor of the Dobsonville community in the Johannesburg
township of Soweto. A policeman and two women were injured
slightly, the report said.
   Another grenade was thrown at a police barracks in the Dube
section of Soweto. No injuries were reported.

   Stolen microfilm containing information

   A safe containing the microfilm was found in the lake near
Kuopio in eastern Finland on Friday, the Iltasanomat newspaper

   In 1986, thieves broke into the town's University Hospital and
stole the safe, which contained the equivalent of $400 in cash and
microfilmed information on the 4.9 million Finns.
   The film included the name, social security number, birthplace
and mother tongue of each registered resident.
   The theft triggered a nationwide debate about the availability
of private information on file.
   The thieves remain at large, Iltasanomat said.

   The Soviet Union accused the United States and
Pakistan on Monday of ignoring virtually the entire agreement on
Afghanistan since the first Soviet soldiers left one year ago.
   ``Pakistan and the United States practically fully ignored their
obligations on all points'' of the Geneva agreement leading to the
withdrawal of the Soviet soldiers, said the Communist Party daily
Pravda.
   It charged that the two countries signed the agreement ``already
having decided not to fulfill it. For them the main goal was to
gain the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan.''
   The agreement was signed by Pakistan, the United States, the
Soviet Union and Afghanistan on April 14, 1988, and the first
Soviet soldiers were withdrawn on May 15, 1988. The last left
Afghanistan on Feb. 15, nine months later.
   The Red Army entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to replace one
pro-Soviet government with another, and more than 100,000 soldiers
were in the country before the withdrawal. More than 13,000 Soviet
soldiers died and 35,000 were wounded.
   Moslem guerrillas supported by the United States and Pakistan
have tried to take several key Afghan cities from the government
since the withdrawal but have failed. Pravda said the army of
Afghan President Najib was fighting better and had better spirit.
   Pravda accused Pakistan of sending thousands of its soldiers to
fight with anti-Marxist Afghan guerrillas and planning the
guerrillas' strategy. It charged that Pakistan was trying to turn
Afghanistan into a satellite.
   After the withdrawal, ``our southern neighbor found itself
facing a widening direct military aggression on the part of the
Pakistani military and reactionary regimes cooperating with them,''
Pravda said.
   The Communist Party daily said Pakistan's course posed a
``serious threat to regionial peace and international security.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev, at a regular
news briefing Monday, told reporters that 2,829 civilians died in
fighting during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan and that 50
mosques were seriously damaged.
   Many people were killed when guerrillas rained thousands of
artillery shells on Jalalabad on May 12, he said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Marshals Service started evicting
tenants Monday from 300 public and private housing units where
illegal drugs sales were suspected.
   ``We matched up eviction orders ... with intelligence
information indicating that those are the centers of drug activity
... crack houses,'' said Steve Boyle, spokesman for the U.S.
Marshals Service.
   The Bush administration has decided to take on the district's
drug problem and earlier this month unveiled a program that
includes evicting drug offenders from federally funded housing
projects.
   In the District of Columbia, the marshals carry out evictions
ordered by the D.C. Superior Court. Boyle said Monday's action,
while not part of the federal plan, was partially in response to
the federal focus on drug-related crime in the district.
   ``We took a look at our resources and decided that we could use
our eviction rule to deal with the problem locally,'' he said.
   Although Boyle conceded that the anti-drug evictions were not a
cure-all, he said the objective was to return control of the homes
to the owners and to give neighbors a break from the drug
trafficking.
   A total of 1,625 apartments in the city are awaiting evictions,
he said. Those are typically the result of legal actions initiated
by the owners of rental property against renters who failed to pay
their rent or damaged the property. About 300 of the residences
have been identified as crack houses.
   About 20 percent of the residences involved in the evictions
were public housing, while 80 percent were private apartments, said
Boyle.
   Authorities said the evictions will continue over the next few
days until the 300 families on the list have vacated their homes.

   A court will hear an appeal by
dissident playwright Vaclav Havel for his release from an
eight-month jail sentence, his brother said Monday.
   Havel asked the court earlier this month to release him after he
serves half his jail term on charges connected with January
anti-government protests, according to his brother, Ivan. He is
entitled to the reduction under the law.
   The appeal, which will be heard Wedensday, is backed by 3,300
people who signed a petition calling for Havel's release, Ivan
Havel said.
   The playwright's jailing brought protest in the West and from
some East bloc allies. In Poland, Premier Miecyslaw Rakowski
pointedly attended a Warsaw performance of two Havel plays, which
are banned in Czechoslovakia.
   Havel was arrested Jan. 16 during an anti-government
demonstration in Prague. He was convicted on charges of inciting
people to take part in an earlier protest.

   Professors at Uganda's only state-run

vowed to continue a strike until their salary demands are met.
   Professors at Makerere University have unsuccessfully pressed
for better working conditions and more pay for three years,
according to Mujaju Akiiki of the social sciences department.
   On Monday, they told Deputy Prime Minister Eriya Kategaya they
would no longer negotiate, Akiiki said. Kategaya reportedly had
been sent to ask that the striking professors return to the

   The strike began May 2 but was suspended six days later for
talks with government negotiators. The teachers voted to resume the

   Professors at the school earn about $35 a month. They are
seeking a minimum of $576 a month.

<HEAD>Cyprus Suing For Stolen Church Treasures in United States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cyprus is suing an Indiana art dealer for
the return of ancient mosaics looted from a Cypriot church after
the island was invaded by Turkey, a deputy state attorney general
said Monday.
   ``This is considered a test case and we are lucky it is being
held before an American court. We have full confidence in American
justice,'' said Michael Kyprianou, who will represent the Cyprus
government before an Indiana state court in the case starting May
30.
   ``Cyprus is determined to use all legal means in order to secure
the return of our country's cultural heritage, and the case brought
against Ms. Goldberg is proof of this determination,'' Kyprianou
said.
   The Kanakaria mosaics, named for the church they graced, date
from the sixth century and depict the Virgin Mary cradling the
infant Jesus. They are considered unique and the Ghetty Museum
reportedly has offered Indiana dealer Peg Goldberg $20 million for
them.
   Ms. Goldberg maintains she has legal title because she bought
the mosaics for $1 million from Aydin Dikmet, a Turkish dealer
based in Munich.
   The Cyprus government and the Orthodox Church of Cyprus, which
have lodged the case jointly, argue the title is invalid and the
mosaics were stolen during systematic plundering of churches in
northern Cyprus.
   ``These mosaics, priceless examples of Byzantine art, are
irreplaceable aspects of our country's cultural heritage. They were
literally ripped off the walls of the church sometime after the
Turkish invasion of Cyprus,'' Kyprianou added.
   Turkey seized the northern part of the eastern Mediterranean
island in July 1974 after a short-lived coup by supporters of union
with Greece.
   Athanasis Papageorgiou, the acting director of Cypriot
Antiquities who will fly to Indiana with Kyprianou, said that
``unfortunately since the 1974 invasion several gangs of Turks have
been removing wall paintings, mosaics and icons from churches in
the Turkish occupied region and trying to sell them abroad.''
   Some looted treasures has been recovered with the help of
Interpol, he said.
   Abbot Paul of Macheras will fly to Indiana to represent the
Orthodox Church, which he said is the ``physical owner of the
mosaics and other looted treasures.''
   The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe announced
last week it will send a special mission to Cyprus next month to
investigate the extent of the destruction of the island's heritage
in the Turkish-occupied region.
   A report submitted to the assembly last week said 30 churches in
Turkish-occupied Cyprus were stripped of their icons, wall
paintings and other liturgical objects and have been converted into
mosques.
   The report said another 17 churches were used by the Turkish
army and 45 were converted to stables or warehouses.

<HEAD>Famed Banking Dynasty Returning to Frankfurt after 88-Year Absence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rothschild banking dynasty,
which has its roots in Frankfurt's Jewish ghetto, plans to reopen
an office in this financial capital after an 88-year absence, the
city treasurer said Monday.
   Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the son of a Jewish money-changer in
the Frankfurt ghetto, started the family financial empire in the
18th century.
   Rothschild family members later expanded the banking business to
Vienna, London, Naples and Paris, building strength with the help
of huge international loans. The Frankfurt office was closed in
1901 as the city's role as a financial center temporarily waned.
   ``We are especially pleased that a banking house that was
founded here during the Jewish epoch is now returning,'' said city
treasurer Ernst Gerhardt. ``We feel it is a special honor.''
   He said Rothschild plans to open an office with about 20 people
this summer.
   ``It's a representative office of the two houses, London and
Zurich,'' Gerhardt added. N.M. Rothschild and Sons is located in
London, while Rothschild Bank AG is based in Zurich. The
Rothschilds also have a bank branch in Paris. Gerhardt said the
Rothschilds eventually hope to found a full branch office in
Frankfurt with several hundred employees.
   Frankfurt is expected to take on even greater prominence when
European Community countries eliminate internal trade barriers in
1992.
   The Rothschilds once were the leading financial family in
Frankfurt.
   Last November, West Germany's only museum devoted to Jewish life
and culture opened in the Rothschild Palace on the banks of the
Main River in Frankfurt.
   Exhibits range from documentation of the Jewish traditions in
the city to the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust that claimed the
lives of 6 million European Jews.
   ``Rothschild knows where it's coming from, and Frankfurt knows
which traditions it has. That was left unsaid during the
discussions,'' Gerhardt said of the lengthy talks leading to the
bank's decision. ``But it never caused a problem.
   ``We see it as a sign of the orientation of old Jewish families
who remember Frankfurt,'' he added.
   The Rothschilds had lived in Frankfurt since the Middle Ages and
the family's original house was destroyed by Allied bombers during
World War II.
   The family gained prominence by financing such massive projects
as European railroads and the British military campaign that led to
the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at Waterloo in June 1815.
   Its political and financial power reached enormous heights
during the first half of the 19th century.
   Members of the family also have become philanthropists, art
patrons and sportsmen.
   The Associated Press tried to contact Rothschild Bank in Zurich
for further comment, but the Swiss office was closed for a holiday
Monday.

<HEAD>Administration Promises to Guard Against Unsafe CFC Substitutes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will strictly police
industry efforts to find substitutes for ozone-depleting chemicals
to make sure proposed replacements are safe, an Environmental
Protection Agency official said Monday in announcing the policy
change.
   William Rosenberg, assistant administrator of air and radiation,
told a House hearing that the agency will now require chemical
firms to report results of health and safety tests of the
substitutes, and would not hesitate to order additional testing if
warranted.
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee, said throughout the hearing
that he was concerned the EPA was rushing to approve alternatives
to chlorofluorocarbons _ CFCs _ without ensuring their safety.
   The congressional General Accounting Office sharply rebuked EPA
two months ago, saying the agency was relying too much on voluntary
cooperation by the chemical industry to provide EPA with test
results on proposed substitutes.
   ``It is a bit of shift,'' said EPA spokesman Chris Rice. ``It
means we're taking the affirmative step of requiring firms to
report data on toxicity of CFC substitutes.''
   An EPA source, speaking only on condition he not be named, said:
``We were taking lot of grief. We didn't think the grief was
justified, and we're taking the path of least resistance.''
   Rosenberg also insisted at the hearing that the United States
would not ``create a new environmental problem'' by rushing to
approve substitutes that were unsafe to humans or the environment.
   Dingell held the hearing to assess progress of the Montreal
Protocol, an international agreement that commits the United States
and other signers to a 50 percent reduction in production and
consumption of CFC's by 1998.
   President Bush has said the United States prefers to negotiate
with signatory countries a total phase-out by the end of the
century if safe alternatives are available.
   Dingell appeared angry when Rosenberg said he didn't know
whether the Bush administration would continue to back a total
phase-out if safe alternatives are unavailable.
   ``Isn't that the kind of question you should know the answer to
before we go negotiating?'' Dingell asked.
   Rosenberg said the administration still planned to siphon off
$2.45 billion over the next three years from profits of companies
making CFCs, a deficit-reduction proposal that has infuriated
chemical producers.
   The EPA official said he expects that without the measure,
manufactures of CFCs would reap windfall profits as production
declined in accordance with the Montreal agreement, while demand
remained high until substitutes were mass-produced.
   Dingell argued that Japan, instead of taxing its CFC
manufacturers, is giving them subsidies.
   ``The Japanese are going to be able to compete much better on
CFCs'' Dingell said. ``They tend to be very smart folks, the
Japanese, when competing with the United States. ''
   CFCs are chemicals that are non-toxic when released into the
atmosphere, but 10 to 100 years later, when they rise 15-20 miles
to the stratosphere, their chemical bonds break apart.
   Scientists say their chlorine atoms destroy ozone, allowing more
of the sun's ultraviolet rays to reach earth, causing more skin
cancer and eye cataracts, and suppressing human immune systems.

<HEAD>State Department Criticizes Bill to End Aid to Cambodian Opposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Monday criticized a
bill that would cut off aid to Cambodian opposition groups fighting
to end Vietnam's occupation of their country.
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, would stop aid to factions
headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Pell want to stop the funding
out of concern that the money would strengthen the Khmer Rouge, one
of Sihanouk's coalition partners, which killed up to 2 million
Cambodians when it ruled the country in the 1970s.
   The Bush administration believes U.S. aid to the coalition
should be increased in a bid to ensure that Vietnam fulfills a
promise to end its 10-year occupation of Cambodia by September.
   ``The administration shares fully the strong concern of Congress
regarding the Khmer Rouge,'' said State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher. ``We are unalterably opposed to their taking
control again in Cambodia.''
   But the best way to achieve this, Boucher added, is through a
negotiated settlement which would include ``effective measures,
including an international peacekeeping force, to constrain the
Khmer Rouge.''
   Sihanouk and the ``non-communist resistance are central to the
successful negotiation of a settlement. By weakening the
non-communist resistance, the prospect of a political settlement is
reduced and the chances of civil war increased, as does the threat
of a Khmer Rouge return to dominance,'' Boucher said.

<TEXT>
   Anti-drug groups have started a petition
drive to get a tougher marijuana law on the books in Alaska, the
only state where smoking a joint at home is legal.
   For 14 years, Alaska law has not prohibited adult use or
possession of less than 4 ounces of marijuana in one's home. In the
rest of the country, marijuana use at home can bring penalties
ranging from a citation to six years in prison.
   Opponents of Alaska's law say it sends the wrong message to
young people in a state where alcoholism and drug abuse rates are
among the highest in the nation.
   But repeated attempts to restore criminal penalties have failed.
When the Legislature adjourned its 1989 session last week three
such bills were stuck in committee, although they can be taken up
again next year.
   The anti-drug groups' petition drive is aimed at getting a new
law on the 1990 ballot.
   ``The time has come for us to take this matter into our own
hands,'' said Marie Majewske, a retired teacher and leader of the
initiative.
   ``When you have students from 60 different high schools in the
state coming up with a resolution unanimously to ask the
Legislature to recriminalize marijuana, it seems to me that's a
real cry for help,'' she said. ``They're asking for help and we're
just sitting by and doing nothing.''
   Part of the difficulty in changing Alaska's liberal approach
toward marijuana is that it resulted from court order, not
legislative design.
   Alaska's Supreme Court ruled in 1975 that the state's marijuana
laws were unconstitutional in prohibiting possession of small
amounts at home. The ruling was based on the Alaska Constitution's
strong privacy clause, adopted by voters in 1972.
   The court said that while the state had a right to protect the
public health and welfare, its interest in prohibiting the use of
marijuana did not justify intruding upon an individual's privacy at
home.
   Possession outside the home is illegal. Having less than an
ounce in public is punishable by a fine of up to $100. Having more
than 1 ounce but less than 8, without intent to sell, can bring a
$1,000 fine and 90 days in jail.
   The Supreme Court said evidence of marijuana's health dangers in
1975 was inconclusive but added that proof of a health threat could
justify a ban on possession at home.
   As a result, legislative efforts have centered on new evidence
of marijuana's dangers, with such issues as lung cancer, addiction
or mental harm.
   Some legislators dispute the findings and say marijuana is no
more harmful that many legal drugs.
   ``We don't treat all of our drug problems the same, clearly,''
said Sen. Pat Pourchot. ``We have different standards for alcohol
and nicotine use than we do for marijuana.''
   The Alaska attorney general's office concluded in a bill
analysis that recriminalizing home use of marijuana would result in
only a few hundred cases a year.
   But it said the cases would be costly to prosecute because the
defendants would likely be ``middle-class people who can be
expected to vigorously resist having a criminal record.''
   Backers of recriminalization say it is hypocritical to tell
young people that marijuana is bad for them while the state allows
their parents to get stoned at home.
   ``By legalizing any amount of marijuana you're putting it on the
same side of tobacco and alcohol, and we're having enough problems
with those now,'' Majewske said.
   Doug McVay, a spokesman for the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws in Washington, said prohibition does not
stop marijuana use, and Alaska's approach allows users to avoid
associating with criminals by growing small amounts at home.
   ``In the other states there is no means for access to marijuana
except through the black market or by resorting to violating the
law,'' he said.
   For Majewske, the issue is Alaska's children. ``I just finally
reached a point where I just found too many of our bright kids
losing interest and their passion for life because of the joint
they take on the weekend,'' she said.

   Most of the U.S. troops ordered to Panama last
week by President Bush have arrived and about 1,400 dependents who
were living there have moved inside military bases, the Pentagon
said Monday.
   Maj. Kathy Wood, a spokeswoman, said the 890 soldiers sent from
the 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif., and the 165
Marines sent from the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force were all in
place.
   Airlifts have begun for the 726 soldiers being dispatched from
the 5th Infantry Division at Fort Polk, La., the spokeswoman added.
That battalion will be in place by Tuesday, but their heavy
equipment is being sent by sea and won't arrive for several days,
she said.
   Meantime, the Panama-headquartered U.S. Southern Command told
the Pentagon over the weekend that all so-called ``command
sponsored'' military families _ meaning they are there under
official U.S. government sponsorship _ had moved inside military
bases as ordered, Wood said.
   The families who are not command sponsored have been urged to
move to one of the 10 U.S. military installations in Panama, but
cannot be forced to do so.
   According to the Pentagon, there are about 14,000 dependents of
servicemen and Defense Department employees living in Panama, of
whom 3,081 live off base. Of that total, 1,396 are
command-sponsored and 1,685 are not.

<TEXT>
   Iraq has repaired its war-battered deep
water Persian Gulf oil terminal and will start oil exports from it
next month, a Cabinet minister said Monday.
   Two of the four loading jetties at the Bakr port have been fully
repaired and are operational, Transport and Communications Minister
Mohammad Hamza said. Exports begin June 1 at 800,000 barrels per
day, he said.
   Restoration of the full pre-war export capacity of 1.6 million
barrels daily will take at least four more months, Hamza said.
   During the eight-year Iran-Iraq war the terminal was badly
damaged, and Iraq was forced to export oil by piping it through
Turkey and Saudi Arabia and transporting it by truck through
Jordan. The war halted with a U.N.-mediated cease-fire on Aug. 20.
   Still under repair, however, are the undersea pipelines
connecting southern oil fields to the northern Persian Gulf
terminal, 30 miles southeast of Umm Qasr, shipping sources said.
   The Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's main outlet to the sea, is
still clogged with war debris. Iraq is clearing a 15-mile stretch
around Basra of unexploded shells and wrecked ships, but work is
slow because of the lack of technical expertise and the large
number of unexploded shells, diplomatic sources said.
   A joint effort between Iraq and Iran to clear the waterway is
one of Iraq's principal demands in peace talks with its neighbor.
   Ten new jetties have been built in the Umm Qasr port since the
cease-fire, and Iraq signed contracts with a local company to build
13 others in Khour Al-Zubair terminal about 10 miles north.
   Shipping officials said 18 wrecked ships were cleared from the
port, which has returned to its pre-war capacity of eight million
tons of cargo yearly. The new jetties will bring capacity up to 12
million tons a year, sources said.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez was sworn in
Monday as president and promised ``authentic democracy'' in
Paraguay after 34 years of dictatorship by Gen. Alfredo Stroessner,
whom he overthrew Feb. 3.
   ``The people have recovered their confidence,'' he said. ``They
have demonstrated a will to undo past mistakes and an uncontainable
desire to live in peace and democracy.''
   The Rev. Ismael Rolon, Roman Catholic archbishop of Asuncion,
said at a special Mass that the coup that ousted Streossner
``purified and glorified the spirits and cleared the suffocating
atmosphere of so many years of corruption and shamelessness.''
   In the weeks between the coup and national elections May 1,
Rodriguez, 65, promoted civil liberties and eased tensions with the
church and within the governing Colorado Party.
   He won 74 percent of the vote. International observers, even
losing candidates, said the many election irregularities did not
change the fact of a landslide victory for Rodriguez.
   ``I swear to my countrymen to be be an obedient servant who will
defend with them ... our freedom, our republican form of government
and our authentic democracy,'' he said Monday.
   Dressed in a dark civilian suit rather than military uniform, he
placed his right hand on a Bible held by his wife Nelida and took
the oath of office.
   Rodriguez arrived at Congress for the inauguration ceremony in
an open convertible led by 21 flag-bearing horsemen.
   He attended the Mass at the national cathedral later and
reviewed a noisy military parade marking Paraguay's 178th
anniversary of independence from Spain.
   Among those attending the inauguration were presidents Raul
Alfonsin of Argentina, Jose Sarney of Brazil and Julio M.
Sanguinetti of Uruguay. The U.S. delegation was led by Dorothy
Bush, the president's daughter.
   Rodriguez and a new Congress were elected to finish five-year
terms that began in August 1988. He has pledged not to seek
re-election and promised to reform the constitution and electoral
code, crack down on corruption and remove repressive laws used to
harass dissidents.
   The only foreign chief executive at any of Stroessner's eight
consecutive inaugurations was Juan Peron, who attended the first
one in 1954 as president of Argentina.
   After donning the presidential sash Monday, Rodriguez swore in
the Cabinet of technocrats he named as provisional president.

   Prosecutors in the Oliver North case advised a
federal court as soon as they found out one of their office
secretaries was related to the jury foreman, a spokesman for the

   James Wieghart, speaking for independent counsel Lawrence E.

cousin Gertrude Griffin, but did not discuss the case with her and
did not report the meeting or the relationship to the court.
   ``She knew her job, and I knew mine,'' Anderson said. ``Just
because she worked for Keker didn't mean diddlywink.''
   John Keker prosecuted the independent counsel's case against
North.
   Wieghart said Ms. Griffin worked at the independent counsel's
office at the federal courthouse during the trial and that she
wasn't Keker's personal secretary.
   The relationship came up at the end of the trial before the jury
received its instructions from U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell.
   Gesell held a closed-door session on the matter with Griffin
present and North lawyer Brendan Sullivan questioned her. The
record of that proceeding is sealed.
   Anderson and her 11 fellow jurors convicted North, a former
Marine colonel and National Security Council staffer, on three
felony counts in the Iran-Contra affair and acquitted him of nine
others.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
450,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year under a
long-term supply agreement, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The corn is scheduled for deliver by Sept. 30, the end of the
sixth year of a long-term grain-supply agreement between the Soviet
Union and the United States.
   Officials said the latest sales boosted total U.S. corn and
wheat sales to the Soviets in 1988-89 to a record level of nearly
19.9 million tons, including more than 15.5 million tons of corn
and 4.31 million tons of wheat.
   Additionally, sales include 443,400 tons of soybeans, 1.37
million tons of soybean meal and 807,400 tons of grain sorghum.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 450,000 tons of
corn would be about 17.7 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.58 per bushel at the
farm, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning that
the sale could have a farm value of around $46 million.
   Wheat sales to the Soviet Union have been subsidized under the
department's Export Enhancement Program. The corn and other
commodities are not subsidized.

<HEAD>Genscher Claims Germans Carry Special Weight in Missile Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher said Monday that West Germany's position must carry
special weight in the decision on whether to upgrade NATO
short-range missiles.
   In an interview with Radio Luxembourg, he pressed his campaign
for quickly convening a superpower disarmament forum aimed at
reducing short-range missiles based in Europe.
   Most NATO short-range rockets are based in West Germany, and
Bonn officials have requested that the upgrade project be postponed.
   Genscher said that along with the Americans, West Germans make
the largest contribution to NATO defenses, ``and therefore it is
perfectly normal for the West German government's view to carry a
corresponding weight in the matter.''
   The United States and Britain want full alliance support to be
shown at the NATO summit in Brussels May 29-30 for the short-range
upgrade project known as ``modernization.''
   West Germany, however, holds firm to its position that the
superpowers should be working to reduce the weapons before moving
to upgrade them, and the short-range issue now threatens to
dominate the 16-nation NATO summit.
   The Western alliance devised a plan five years ago to replace
aging Lance nuclear missiles by 1995 with new rockets that would
have more than triple the range.
   A go-ahead vote on modernization had been expected at the
summit, but West Germany insists the decision be put off for at
least two years.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Genscher instead want the United
States and the Soviet Union to open talks on reducing the
short-range forces. But Washington has tied those negotiations to a
balance of NATO and Warsaw Pact conventional armed forces.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has begun pulling back
50,000 Kremlin troops and 5,000 tanks from Eastern Europe as a
gesture toward reducing Soviet bloc predominance, but U.S.
officials contend the West's troops will remain widely outnumbered.
   West Germany's call for interim negotiations on short-range
weapons broke with NATO policy, and some alliance nations expressed
a measure of support for Bonn's position, widening the
interalliance gap.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze stepped up the
pressure on Washington last week when he threatened a possible
breach of the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty if NATO
goes ahead with modernization.
   He likened the planned Lance replacement missiles to the
Kremlin's SS-23, which is being dismantled under the INF treaty.
   He said the Kremlin would be forced to consider halting the
SS-23 destructions or developing a new missile to replace it.
   The SS-23s have a range of about 300 miles, which is the
threshhold between the short- and intermediate-range categories.
   The new missiles NATO plans as Lance replacements would have
about the same range.

   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to kill a
lawsuit by a Washington state prison inmate who says his rights
were violated when authorities conducted a rectal search.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Washington
Gov. Booth Gardner and prison officials may be sued.
   Lanford D. Tribble, an inmate at the state penitentiary in Walla
Walla, challenged a policy requiring prisoners to undergo rectal
searches when transferred to a special prison unit for security
reasons.
   Tribble was moved to the special unit in January 1986 after
guards discovered contraband in the cell he shared with two other
inmates.
   He was searched by a physician's assistant after he was
handcuffed behind his back and placed in leg irons chained around
his waist.
   Tribble said the search violated his privacy rights and was
intended as punishment.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that such
searches do not violate the constitutional rights of prisoners if
conducted for reasons of prison security or are ``reasonably
related to a legitimate penological need.''
   But the appeals court said evidence exists that indicates the
searches at the Washington prison were intended for other reasons.
   ``Tribble has presented evidence that the prison staff do not
search clothing, hair, hands or any body cavity other than the
rectal cavity,'' the appeals court said. ``This evidence is most
telling of the actual purpose of the digital rectal search policy.
   ``One can draw an inference that a search limited to the rectal
cavity may be done for punitive purposes because prisoners can
smuggle contraband ... by concealing it elsewhere,'' the appeals
court said.
   The appeals court noted that routine rectal searches for
prisoners transferred to the special unit were abandoned after
Tribble sued. The new policy authorizes searches only when there is
a reasonable suspicion an inmate is hiding contraband in his rectum.
   State and prison officials generally are immune from such
lawsuits. The Supreme Court has held that officials are shielded
from suit unless they ``violate clearly established statutory or
constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have
known.''
   The case is Gardner vs. Tribble, 88-1259.

<TEXT>
   President Alan Garcia, beset by a growing
leftist insurgency and inflation that may surpass 10,000 percent
this year, swore in his fourth Cabinet in as many years Monday.
   Leading the 15-member government as prime minister is Luis
Alberto Sanchez, 88, a senator who is among Peru's most respected
political figures.
   Other new ministers include retired Gen. Julio Velasquez for
defense, Cesar Vasquez Bazan for economy and finance and Mario
Samame at energy and mines. Vasquez Bazan, 37, has criticized
Garcia for imposing price controls and not raising taxes.
   An appointment that drew criticism from the political opposition
was the new interior minister, Agustin Mantilla, who had been
minister of the presidency.
   Opposition publications have linked Mantilla, the deputy
interior minister from Garcia's inauguration in July 1985 to March
of this year, to the paramilitary Rodrigo Franco front.
   The organization, named for a top official of the governing
party killed by leftist Shining Path guerrillas, began operations
last year with the assassination of a lawyer who represented a
leader of the guerrilla group.
   Mantilla replaces Armando Villanueva, who was interior minister
and premier until he and his government resigned May 8.

<HEAD>Environmental Group Urges Immediate Ban on U.S. Trade in Ivory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group urged President Bush on
Monday to halt U.S. trade in elephant ivory in order to protect the
animal's declining numbers.
   Defenders of Wildlife said it sent a letter to Bush urging him
to direct Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan to impose an immediate
ivory trading ban and to provide money and equipment loans to the
African nations most affected by such a ban.
   In the letter, Rupert Cutler, president of the group, said an
estimated 300 African elephants a day are killed by poachers, a
rate he said ``will practically guarantee'' the extinction of the
elephant by the end of the century.
   Lujan last week said he told U.S. representatives to an
international conference next October to push for increased
protection of the African elephant.
   He said the United States at the meeting will urge that the
elephant be placed in a more protected classification under the
international endangered species treaty, thereby prohibiting any of
the 101 treaty nations from engaging in the commercial trading of
ivory.
   Lujan said he had instructed department officials to recommend
whether to change the African elephant's classification from
``threatened'' to ``endangered'' under the U.S. endangered species
law.
   Last year the United States imported $32 million worth of ivory,
most of which originated with the African elephant.

<TEXT>
   A man who was wrongly diagnosed as
having AIDS says the error cost him his job, his home and his
girlfriend and nearly led him to suicide.
   Michael Peoples, 34, believed for 12 days that he had AIDS
because of a mixup in the laboratory at the Veterans Administration
Hospital and learned the truth on March 7, the same day he said he
had resolved to kill himself.
   ``A lab technician assigned the same number to two patients,''
hospital spokesman Craig Koller said Monday. ``We regret it very
much. It's something we acknowledge took place and we're very
concerned about.''
   Peoples said he now lives in a Columbus shelter for the homeless
since his girlfriend kicked him out and he lost his job.
   Peoples told The Columbus Dispatch he was notified Feb. 23 he
had AIDS. He said he was so depressed by the diagnosis that ``I
wrote a suicide note and decided I was going to carry it out the
day before my birthday (March 8).''
   Koller said the hospital was trying to contact Peoples and his
employer, a temporary service company where he tagged shipping
crates, as well as his girlfriend ``to help rectify this.''
   Koller said the lab technician probably will not be punished.
   ``It was an error that was caught and rectified. The procedure
that allowed this to happen was investigated and subsequently
revised,'' he said.
   ``I would say this is a very rare occurrence. It has never had
happen before. Our lab service does close to 2 million lab tests a
year.''
   Koller would neither confirm nor deny Peoples' claim that a
doctor at the hospital told Peoples' sister and son about the AIDS
diagnosis before the error was caught and before Peoples could tell
them himself.
   ``It is against all of our policies and procedures to give out
such information to anyone other than the patient,'' Koller said.
   Peoples, who had entered the hospital for treatment of
alcoholism, told the newspaper that before the error was corrected,
his former fiancee called his employer, believing she had been
exposed to the virus.
   Peoples said his employer did not admit the AIDS diagnosis cost
him his job. The employer said his job had been filled while he was
in the hospital, Peoples said.
   The newspaper did not identify Peoples' former employer, his
former fiancee or his girlfriend.

<HEAD>Study: Global Warming Could Force Building of Costly Power Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Global warming by the year 2010 could require the
building of 86 more power plants at a cost of $110 billion so that
Americans can run their air conditioners, a new study says.
   The study was conducted by DRI McGraw Hill Energy Group of
Lexington and Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc. of
Cambridge.
   Using computer models, researchers concluded that global warming
would raise average annual temperatures nationwide two degrees by
2010, and the drain on power would require the building of 86 new
midsize power plants nationwide.
   That would result in about a 4 percent increase in electricity
costs, the study found.
   Global warming, also known as the greenhouse effect, is caused
by solar heat trapped under gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide
and other pollutants associated with burning fossil fuels are
considered chief causes.
   The study looked only at carbon dioxide as a factor, but
scientists have pointed to many others, including chemicals used in
air conditioners.
   Some scientists say global warming could raise temperatures four
to nine degrees by 2050 and melt polar ice caps and cause sea
levels to rise, causing severe droughts and storms and disrupting
the Earth's biological systems.
   The study, which will be presented Thursday at the Edison
Electric Institute in Seattle, bolsters arguments that ignoring
global warming could be expensive.
   ``We didn't know whether or not the kind of changes that these
atmospheric scientists were talking about really would make much of
a difference,'' said Larry Makovich, a study author. ``It does, I
think, put some hard numbers to it.''
   Researchers found that higher temperatures bring lower heating
needs in the winter, but power plants are built to handle peak
demand, and exceptionally hot summers would drive the peak
significantly beyond current levels, Makovich said.
   The predicted need for new plants poses a dilemma for utilities,
said George Loehr, acting executive director of the Northeast Power
Coordinating Council.
   Building conventional plants means stoking the ``greenhouse''
gases, while nuclear power plants are becoming increasingly
unpopular, he said.
   That leaves conservation as the most attractive option, he said.

<HEAD>State Department Denounces Soviet Foreign Minister on Missile Pact</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 5-7, bgng ``In contrast,'' with Baker's comments
on Capitol Hill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department denounced on Monday as
``outlandish'' a Soviet threat to consider retaining some nuclear
missiles outlawed in a 1987 treaty if NATO proceeded with a program
to upgrade short-range weapons.
   A department spokesman, Richard Boucher, also dismissed reports
the United States was working out a compromise with West Germany,
which opposes the modernization program for the 88 Lance launchers
and their 700 or so missiles.
   ``I don't see any sort of compromise shaping up, but we are
certainly continuing discussions,'' the U.S. official said.
   Boucher said President Bush was in touch with West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and that Gerhard Stoltenberg, the West
German defense minister, probably would be here on Friday for
further talks.
   In contrast to the U.S. criticism, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III saluted the economic reforms undertaken by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as ``truly revolutionary.''
   Baker, who was in Moscow last week, said Soviet leaders were
``singing out of our hymn book.''
   Appearing at a session Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., arranged
with some constitutents, Baker said warmer relations between the
Soviet Union and China were not of concern to the West and could
enhance world stability.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, visiting Bonn on
Saturday, warned that if the United States did not drop plans to
more than triple the range of the Lance missiles to more than 250
miles the Soviet Union would respond by developing a new
short-range weapon or by retaining SS-23s, which have a range of
about 310 miles.
   The treaty, signed here in December 1987 by then-President
Reagan and Gorbachev, provided for the destruction of all U.S. and
Soviet nuclear missiles in the intermediate range _ from 300 to
3,500 miles.
   On Sunday, Baker said Shevardnadze's threat to suspend
destruction of SS-23 missiles would violate the 1987 treaty and
could be part of a publicity campaign to divide the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   ``This is a matter that was specifically negotiated when the INF
Treaty was negotiated,'' Baker said.
   ``The elimination of the SS-23s on the part of the Soviet Union
... was debated back and forth for quite some time. The Soviets
responded in effect that they would agree to eliminate these
missiles, and now they are doing so,'' Baker said Sunday on the
CBS-TV program, ``Face the Nation.''
   On Monday, the State Department, through Boucher, stepped up the
attack, saying ``we think Shevardnadze's remarks are an outlandish
statement. One day the Soviets announce small unilateral
reductions, the next day they are talking about breaking a recently
concluded treaty.''
   The U.S. official apparently was referring to Gorbachev's
announcement last Thursday while meeting with Baker in Moscow that
the Soviets would withdraw 500 short-range nuclear warheads from
Eastern Europe.
   Baker publicly described the move as a ``modest'' one, designed
in part for public relations. He said the Warsaw Pact held a
sizable advantage over the United States in short-range missiles
and had modernized most of them.
   During negotiations that preceded the 1987 treaty the Soviets
resisted including the SS-23s, but relented. They have 200 missiles
in the category. All are supposed to be destroyed by Dec. 1, and
none have been so far, said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Boucher said the SS-23s undoubtedly were covered by the 1987
treaty and short-range missiles were not covered. He said ``a look
at the text'' would confirm the U.S. position.
   ``We find it especially ironic that the Soviets threaten to
break the INF treaty in an effort to pressure the West on
short-range systems which they have just finished modernizing and
where they hold at least a 12-1 advantage over the West,'' the
spokesman said.
   The Soviet Union began deploying the SS-23-Spider in 1985 as a
replacement for the 1960s-vintage SCUD missile.
   Boucher said the Soviets had no legal right to choose not to
observe part of the treaty.
   The United States, under Reagan, decided not to observe various
limits of the 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, but Boucher
said that accord had not been ratified by the Senate.
   ``It's clearly not a welcome development that the Soviets should
threaten to break treaties which have already been negotiated and
concluded,'' he said. ``I would hope the Soviets would think very
long and hard before they did something like this, but it's
certainly not helpful their making statements like this.''
   Asked if the Bush administration was engaged now in a public
relations war with Moscow, the spokesman said: ``No, we're not.''

   Iran rejected an invitation to a
meeting of Islamic affairs ministers in Saudi Arabia in what
appeared to be a worsening of already strained Saudi-Iranian
relations, diplomats reported Monday.
   Iran and the kingdom are engaged in a war of words over the
Iranian quota for the annual Hajj in July, when Moslems from around
the world converge on Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage to Islam's
holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran was
angry because Saudi Arabia was adhering to a quota system initiated
last year. They said Iran might boycott the pilgrimage, as it did
last year.
   The Iranian daily Jomhuri reported Monday that differences had
almost been resolved when ``the Saudis rejected all previous
agreements and started everything anew,'' Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency said.
   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, quoted the paper as blaming the Saudi
royal family. One group within the family was adamant that Iranian
numbers be limited, the report said.
   In April 1988, Saudi Arabia broke diplomatic ties with Iran. It
cited demonstrations by Iranian pilgrims during the Hajj season of
1987 in which clashes with Saudi police left 402 people dead. It
also noted Iran's repeated attacks on Persian Gulf shipping lanes
during the Iran-Iraq war.
   Saudi Arabia last year started limiting each country to 1,000
pilgrims per million of population.
   The invitation to Iran for the fourth conference of Islamic
ministers of endowments and religious affairs was issued after Iran
took part in an Islamic foreign ministers' conference in Saudi
Arabia in March.
   Relations at that conference of the 46-member Organization of
Islamic Conference were cordial.
   A major item on the agenda of the coming four-day conference
will be coordination and cooperation among Islamic states in
``confronting atheistic destructive trends and distortion campaigns
by enemies of the Islamic faith.''
   All majority Sunni and minority Shiite sects among the world's 1
billion Moslems participate in Islamic meetings.
   But Iran, the only nation with an overwhelming Shiite majority,
stayed away from such meetings after the war with Iraq started in
September 1980. Hostilities ended with a cease-fire last summer.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday proposed reviving the
death penalty for treason, espionage and other capital offenses
already on the books and extending it to such crimes as terrorist
killings.
   The execution provisions were included in a package of
anti-crime proposals unveiled by the administration as part of
Bush's plan to crack down on violent crime.
   Under the proposal, Congress will be asked to amend federal law
so that death-penalty provisions for treason, espionage,
assassination of the president and top federal officials and other
murders comply with Supreme Court procedural requirements laid down
in the 1970s.
   These statutes were never amended to reflect changes in death
penalty laws mandated by the high court to eliminate what the
justices held were arbitrary and discriminatory applications of the
death penalty.
   ``In order for a death sentence to be constitutional, you have
to have procedures and standards that are not currently
incorporated in existing federal law'' for these crimes, said a
Justice Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The unenforceable death penalty also applies to a variety of
killings including aircraft hijackings, train wreckings, and bank
robberies resulting in death and the murder of federal officials.
It applies, too, to mailing dangerous articles and to the
interstate transportation of explosives that result in death.
   To inject fairness, the high court requires special sentencing
proceedings during which the jury must consider if there are
sufficient aggravating circumstances to warrant the death penalty.
The jury must then weigh aggravating factors against mitigating
circumstances to determine whether to impose the death penalty.
   In addition to seeking revival of the death penalty for existing
capital crimes, the administration is proposing to impose it for a
variety of murders including homicides committed by hired killers,
hostage takers or terrorists of American citizens or to further
racketeering.
   The death penalty would also be imposed for murders committed by
federal prisoners serving life sentences, the killing of foreign
officials or internationally protected persons and kidnappings
resulting in death.
   The only death penalty provisions in federal law that the
Justice Department contends meet Supreme Court guidelines were
enacted last year as part of the larger anti-drug legislation.
   That legislation imposes the death penalty for murders committed
to further drug conspiracies. The so-called ``drug kingpin''
provisions include the death penalty for murders ordered by drug
dealers as part of their business.
   Reviving the death penalty for espionage and treason may not
pass constitutional muster.
   In 1977, the Supreme Court overturned a Georgia law that
provided the death penalty for rape, ruling that executions for
crimes that do not involve the taking of a life are
unconstitutional.
   Such proposals ``will spawn a black hole'' of litigation against
the death penalty, warned Richard Burr, director of the death
penalty project of the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense Fund,
Inc.
   ``It creates a black hole into which an enormous amount of human
and financial resources are poured because the death penalty
creates very legitimate and constitutional problems,'' Burr said.
These problems have caused the Supreme Court ``to hear and decide
10 death-penalty cases every term it has sat since 1976,'' he said.
   ``These problems just don't go away.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Suspect in Insurance Slaying Is Right Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge agreed Monday that authorities
captured the right man in the case of a businessman accused of
having a drifter killed so he could pass off the body as his own
and collect the life insurance.
   The suspect, Melvin Hanson, underwent plastic surgery after the
killing and maintained authorities did not have enough evidence to
prove his identity.
   But Common Pleas Judge David Cain ruled otherwise at a hearing
to determine whether Hanson should be extradited to California to
face murder charges in the slaying of Ellis Henry Green. Cain gave
Hanson until Friday to appeal.
   Prosecutors charge that Hanson, co-founder of the Columbus-based
Just Sweats athletic-clothing chain, conspired with his business
partner, John B. Hawkins, and Glendale, Calif., neurologist Richard
Boggs to kill Green.
   Green's body was found in Boggs' office in suburban Los Angeles
in 1988. Boggs identified the body as Hanson's, but a thumbprint
from the body did not match that on the back of Hanson's drivers
license.
   Hawkins allegedly collected $1 million in life insurance
benefits from policies purchased by Hanson.
   Hanson was captured Jan. 29 in Dallas. Boggs is in a California
jail awaiting trial. Hawkins remains at large.
   Police have also said Hawkins and Hanson embezzled up to $2
million from Just Sweats, which they founded in 1985.

<HEAD>Canadian Multimillionaire E.P. Taylor Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   E.P. Taylor, a multimillionaire who built an
international business empire from a small Ottawa brewery and was
renowned for his interest in thoroughbred horse racing, is dead at
the age of 88.
   He died Sunday in the Bahamas, where he had lived since 1977.
The cause of death was not given.
   The giant Argus Corp. remains as a monument to Taylor's
financial zeal, although the closed-end investment fund that
evolved into one of Canada's most powerful corporate entities has
been controlled by others for several years.
   But it was in the breeding and racing of thoroughbred horses at
his Windfield Farms in North Toronto that the pipe-smoking Taylor
became most familiar to the public.
   He frequently appeared in the winner's circle with his
victorious horses. Among his champions was Northern Dancer, the
first Canadian-bred racer to win the Kentucky Derby.
   Rick Cowan, senior vice-president of the Ontario Jockey Club,
said flags will fly at half-staff at Ontario race tracks for
several days.
   He said a memorial service will be held in Toronto, but the date
has not been set.
   Taylor, born in Ottawa, moved to the Bahamas when he retired and
became a citizen of that island nation.
   During World War II he served as executive assistant to the
minister of munitions and supply, vice chairman of the British
Supply Council in North America and Canadian chairman of the joint
war aid committee.
   For his services he was made a Companion of St. Michael and St.
George, the highest British honor for a Canadian citizen.
   Taylor could be an uncompromising executive, and in 1957 he was
accused of being ruthless when he fired the president of one of the
Argus Corp.'s major holdings.
   ``Me ruthless?'' he responded to criticism. ``Certainly not. But
when I'm right and management's consistently wrong, of course I get
rid of management.''
   He also could be impatient with shareholders.
   He once interrupted a shareholder who was pressuring him to
increase dividends from Canadian Breweries Ltd., his major holding
until he founded Argus.
   ``Madam, if you don't like this company I suggest you sell your
shares,'' he told her.
   Taylor married Winifred Thornton Duguid of Ottawa in 1927 and
they had three children, daughters Judith and Louise and son
Charles. Louise died in 1979 and Taylor's wife died in 1982.

   Family Secrets wants its sweet-and-sour sauce in
the open in Singapore. Sun Sprouts of Maine would like its hummus
dip to see the light of day in Denmark.
   These upstarts were among more than 500 companies pitching their
products Monday to 2,000 buyers from 47 countries at the National
Food and Agriculture Exposition.
   ``This is the largest array of processed food products to be
found anywhere in the world,'' said Arthur Brown, president of the
National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.
   Buyers sipped kosher wines, nibbled cheeses and haggled over
whole grain prices in the 50,000-square-foot expo.
   ``Small food processors who wouldn't ordinarily have the funds
or staff to make a stab at the foreign market are finding a forum
here,'' said Dianne R. Bari, spokeswoman for the Mid-America
International Agri-Trade Council, which promotes products from 12
Midwestern states.
   Prospective importers from western Europe, the Middle East and
the Pacific basin journeyed to the three-day show in hopes of
hitting on next year's trendy crowd-pleaser.
   ``I'm always looking for different products and interested in
anything new in food and wine,'' said Romig Michael, a supermarket
wholesaler from St. Johns, Antigua.
   American entrepreneurs are eager to oblige.
   ``The last show was a boon,'' said Bill H. Miller, sales manager
for Consolidated Biscuit Co. of McComb, Ohio. ``It generated more
than a million dollars a year in export business for us last year
in South Korea and Japan.''
   Thomas Polen, a vice president for Meier's Wine Cellars Inc. of
Cincinnati, said Asian countries, which made up more than a quarter
of the foreign buyers, had shown the most interest in his product.
   ``There's a mystique about American wines in the Far East,'' he
said.
   Candy Garner, the Miss South Carolina State Body Building
titleholder, didn't find that market as open to her Jungle Gym
Enterprises herbal steroid replacement products. Some South Korean
buyers turned her down.
   ``I'm interested in meat,'' said Kwang Young Chung of Dongyang
Stores Co. in Seoul. ``And potatoes and onions.''
   Garner said Jungle Gym was looking for just such tips.
   ``There doesn't seem to be that much interest in health and
fitness in the Far East yet,'' she said. ``We're looking more at
European nations. It's much more of a craze there.''
   Many exporters were interested in catering to trends, but others
were vying to create consumer demand where little exists.
   Nathan Herzog, vice president of Kedem Royal Wine Corp., said
France's viticultural reputation didn't keep him from approaching
shopkeepers who regularly deal in Bordeaux and Burgundy.
   ``We do surprisingly well in France,'' the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based
kosher wine exporter said. ``And forums like this are a bonanza.
People come ready to buy.''
   The biennial NASDA exposition last was held in Seattle. The next
expo is planned in 1991 in Las Vegas.

<HEAD>Vice Admiral Says Navy Needs F-14s to Avert Fighter Plane Shortage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Halting production of F-14 jetfighters will
create problems for the Navy in the next 10 years, the assistant
chief of naval operations said Monday.
   Vice Adm. Robert F. Dunn expressed concerns that Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney's proposal to cancel orders in the fiscal
1990 budget for 12 new F-14 fighter jets will force the Navy to
wear out its current fleet of F-14s too soon.
   Cheney, who was required to cut $10 billion from the defense
budget, said the F-14s were too expensive. Reports indicate that
the new planes cost $360 million.
   ``The present budget does not include F-14s in it because of
affordability reasons,'' Dunn told the Senate Armed Services
subcommittee on projection forces and regional defense.
   ``I'm afraid that stopping that production at this time,
however, will put us in jeopardy toward the end of the century,
when we're banking on the Navy ATF (Advanced Tactical Fighter)
coming in to replace it,''
   Dunn said an insufficient number of F-14s will force the Navy
``into transferring them from carrier to carrier as those ships
deploy, using up the service life of those we have back home that
much sooner.''
   The Navy currently has 477 F-14 Tomcats, exceeding the 458 the
service requires, Dunn said. But barring new production by 2000,
the service will be short 56 F-14s, the vice admiral said, basing
his information on data from the Office of Management and Budget.
   Last week, Rep. George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., said that an
analysis prepared for him by the Congressional Research Service of
the Library of Congress found that the Navy will have 110 fewer
F-14s at the end of fiscal 1996.
   ``No matter how you slice the Bush-Cheney budget, it comes up
dangerously short in Navy aircraft, the conventional weapons
America needs and uses in real life,'' said Hochbrueckner.
   The congressman is from Long Island, where the plane is
manufactured by Grumman Corp., of Bethpage, N.Y.

   Three Druse militiamen were killed and
seven were wounded Monday by artillery fire from the
Israeli-supported South Lebanon Army, police reported.
   They said the victims were driving in a jeep in the village of
Mimess, three miles north of the Israeli-created security zone in
southern Lebanon, when their vehicle was hit by a shell.
   Police said the victims were members of Druse leader Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party, which has militia bases in
the western Bekaa Valley near Israel's security zone.
   Israel created the buffer zone when it withdrew its forces from
Lebanon in June 1985. The zone is protected by 2,500 troopers of
the South Lebanon Army militia and about 1,000 Israeli military
personnel.

   Massachusetts is opening another front in its
battle against the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear plant.
   The state, in hearings that began Monday, is questioning whether
an evacuation plan was adequately tested in a drill last June.
   New Hampshire Yankee, which operates the $6 billion plant, was
allowed to write the emergency plan after Massachusetts refused to
help with the drafting. Massachusetts also refused to participate
in the drill.
   The three-member Atomic Safety and Licensing Board of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission began hearings on the plan in March
and started a second phase this week on the practice run held last
June 28 and 29.
   Massachusetts is asking the board to reject the plan.
   In addition, Assistant Attorney General John Traficonte said
Monday, ``We're going to try to prove that things did not happen
the way they should have and that the way the exercise was
structured was not sufficient to test the plan.''
   The 12 utilities that own the plant need approval of the plan to
obtain a full-power operating license as early as this fall.
   The plant, finished in 1986, is 2.1 miles across the state line
from Massachusetts, which has 50,000 to 100,000 people within 10
miles of Seabrook.

<HEAD>Agencies Seek to Improve Bike Safety, Increase Use of Helmets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal agencies announced plans Monday to
improve bicycle safety, including increasing the use of helmets
which officials say are worn by fewer than one in 10 riders.
   Officials of the Consumer Product Safety Commission also said
they are evaluating several types of bicycle helmets to determine
effectiveness in preventing injuries and will consider a petition
from safety groups to set uniform federal standards.
   Anne Pavlich, commission spokeswoman, said the agency is testing
the effectiveness of hard and soft helmets.
   An engineer for the commission, John Preston, said testing
indicates that helmets without a hard shell may be just as
effective in absorbing the energy of a fall or collision as those
with a hard shell.
   Since bicycle helmets usually have large open areas for
ventilation, they are not generally required to resist penetration
by sharp objects the way motorcycle helmets are, he said.
   The comission and the National Highway Safety Administration
signed a memorandum Monday that sets up communication between the
two agencies on bicycle safety research and seeks to coordinate
local and national efforts to increase public understanding of
bicycle safety requirements.
   A group of safety and consumer groups organized as the National
Safe Kids Campaign petitioned the safety commission on Monday to
set performance standards for both adult- and child-size bicycle
helmets. The group said federal standards would help reduce the
1,000 deaths and half-million serious injuries each year in bicycle
accidents.
   The safety administration estimates that fewer than 10 percent
of bicycle riders wear helmets. The agency said many bike accidents
can be prevented with increased attentiveness by cyclists and
motorists.
   Preston said the product safety commission had planned a major
bicycle safety project for 1989 but it was cut back because funds
were not available.
   He said the agency next month plans to review separate voluntary
standards set by the American National Standards Institute and the
Snell Memorial Foundation. The Snell standards are slightly more
stringent. Both standards test the ability of a helmet to absorb
the impact of a collision.
   Preston said it is possible that helmets that meet tough impact
standards may not be the best for common low-speed accidents and
that other design factors might also affect a rider's safety.
   ``The biggest problem, though, is lack of use,'' he said. ``You
can meet the highest standards, but it won't do any good if you
can't convince kids that wearing a helmet is a cool thing to do.''

<TEXT>
   The government played the hero Monday in a drama
to save a theater where William Shakespeare performed, reprieving
the archaeological site for a month with a $1.65 million pledge to
a building developer.
   The reprieve, hours before bulldozing was to begin, followed a
nightlong protest vigil on the muddy site of the Rose Theater and a
morning of meetings by the Environment Department, the state-funded
English Heritage and developers who want to build an office block.
   Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley told the House of Commons
the government intervened because knowledge unearthed in the last
two to three days shows the remains are ``far more important than
thought before.''
   The Rose, found five months ago in excavations for the building,
is the only Elizabethan theater ever discovered. Its more famous
neighbor, the Globe, has disappeared.
   ``It was for this special reason and on this one occasion that
it seems right that the government should have financed the delay
so that forces determined to preserve it should have the right to
do so,'' said Ridley, who is responsible for ancient monuments.
   The delay will enable developers and their architects to work
with English Heritage and his ministry on ``various options,'' he
said. ``We all hope that the theater can not only be preserved ...
but made permanently available to the public.''
   But in sharp questioning from legislators, he said, ``I could
not forecast the outcome of what will be decided.''
   From the site of the continuing vigil, Shakespearean actor Ian
McKellen told BBC-TV: ``We will only be happy and leave when the
minimum requirements are achieved _ when access for it is available
for anybody who wants to see it.''
   The developers, Imry Merchants, already have financed five
months of excavations. They say they will the preserve the theater
by burying the remains under tons of sand and gravel.
Archaeologists say this would damage the fragile remains and keep
them from public view.
   Ridley did not mention a figure, but a spokesman for his
department said the government and English Heritage would
contribute up to $1.65 million ``to any costs of the month's
delay.''
   A spokesman for the developers, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he could not estimate the cost.
   In the Commons, Anthony Beaumont-Dark of the governing
Conservative Party said the government rather should spend money on
``living theater.''
   He said if every archaeological find were preserved, ``London
would be composed of the ruins of Rome.''
   Ridley answered, ``If we were to deny archaeology, I suppose we
were to deny Stonehenge.''
   Lawmaker Simon Hughes, whose district includes the site on the
South bank of the River Thames, asked Ridley for assurance that
piles will not be driven through the site, but he received none.
   The developers plan to drive concrete piles 180 feet deep at the
site, where surviving bricks and mortar clearly map the theater's
two stages, walls and auditorium.
   Opponents of the plan include Laurence Olivier, Dame Peggy
Ashcroft, Dustin Hoffman, Dame Judi Dench, Derek Jacobi, Edward Fox
and Kate O'Mara.
   Shakespeare is thought to have acted in his play ``Henry VI'' at
the Rose.

<HEAD>Number of Pentagon Contractors Fell by Almost 100,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a substantial increase in the defense
budget, almost 100,000 companies stopped doing business with the
Pentagon over a five-year period, said a private report released
Monday.
   The Center for Strategic and International Studies found that in
1982, more than 138,000 companies provided manufactured goods to
the Defense Department. But by 1987, the number had dropped to less
than 40,000.
   ``Some of the 80,000 went out of business, including about
20,000 small businesses,'' the report said. ``Most of the 80,000
firms, however, simply quit doing business with the Defense
Department and opted for other customers.''
   The report described the drop-off as ``remarkable'' in light of
the increase in the defense procurement budget from $54.9 billion
to $87 billion in constant fiscal 1989 dollars.
   The study, ``Deterrence in Decay: The Future of the U.S. Defense
Industrial Base,'' attributed the decline to predatory pricing
tactics used by the larger companies. In some instances, those
companies lowered prices below marginal costs, making it impossible
for the smaller companies to compete.
   In addition, the report found that in comparison to other
industries, ``defense is not a highly profitable business.''
   ``Return on sales in defense overall has been about the same as
in commercial manufacturing, falling from 4.9 percent in 1980 to
3.8 percent in 1986,'' the report said.
   Among the recommendations, the report urged better oversight of
defense industries to reduce costs; improved planning, programming
and budgeting, and incentives for companies in industries that are
disadvantaged internationally in competitive defense markets.
   Specifically, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a co-chair of the
report and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
suggested that Congress and the Pentagon ``bite the bullet ... as
to how we're going to get into multiyear procurement, multiyear
budgeting so that those people who have left the defense industrial
base would have some kind of predictability.''
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., the other co-chair who also serves
on the Armed Services panel, recommended additional spending on
defense industrial base information systems, removing the barriers
between the civilian and military sectors of the economy and
improved coordination between the civilian and national security
departments and agencies.
   The 12-month study was done by the center's staff as well as a
39-member steering committee that included representatives of
academia, former Pentagon officials, the defense industry and
members of the congressional Armed Services panels and their staff.

<TEXT>
   George Bush received $156,000 from a blind
trust worth just under $1 million in his final year as vice
president, his financial disclosure forms showed Monday.
   Bush and his wife Barbara also accepted more than $21,000 in
gifts ranging from country music tapes to running shoes, the report
said.
   It indicated they have assets of $1.09 million other than real
estate. In addition, their house in Kennebunkport, Maine _ not
required to be listed _ is estimated to be worth about $1 million,
bringing their likely net worth to $2 million.
   Vice President Dan Quayle filed a far less detailed disclosure
statement, showing assets held by him and his wife Marilyn in 1988
_ when he was a senator representing Indiana _ of at least $440,000
and possibly $740,000 or more, principally stock in his
family-owned Central Newspapers Inc.
   During his campaign, Quayle valued his net worth at slightly
under $1 million.
   The president's new forms showed a 15.6 percent return on the
trust that Bush, a former Texas oil executive, set up in 1981 when
he became vice president. It was the first time the trust's exact
value _ $998,000 at yearend _ had been disclosed.
   Bush's salary as vice president last year was $115,000.
   The report, Bush's first as president, also showed he paid off
earlier this year $49,000 in three loans he took out in 1979
against life insurance policies.
   Quayle reported his holdings brought in income of between
$18,500 and $52,000. He also reported fees for speeches of $52,797
_ of which he donated $17,304 to charities to keep within the
federal limit on honoraria. His salary as a senator was $89,500.
   Computing his worth is complicated by the fact that the Quayle
family's major assets _ his 99 shares and his wife's 40 shares in
Central Newspapers Inc. _ have no set market value since the
company is privately owned and the stock not traded, according to
his press secretary, David Beckwith.
   Beckwith said that Quayle was not required to fill out a
disclosure form for 1988, but did one anyway. He said the one the
vice president files next year is likely to follow Bush's lead in
providing greater detail.
   Bush put at $31,000 the value of his share of a Houston barge
company, a business venture with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher. Bush earned $11,962
last year on the investment, the financial document showed.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush, a
former Texas oil executive, intends to put his interest in the
barge company _ which leases four liquid petroleum barges to gas
companies in the Gulf of Mexico _ into his blind trust.
   Federal law does not require the listing of real estate on the
disclosure forms. Bush and his wife own the house in Kennebunkport
_ part of a $3.5 million estate owned principally by Bush's mother
_ and an empty lot in Houston.
   Some of the details in the report were disclosed when Bush's
income tax forms were made public on April 13.
   However, other details, such as the value of his holdings and
the list of gifts, did not show up on the tax forms.
   In the past, for instance, Bush indicated the value of his blind
trust only as ``over $250,000.'' Fitzwater said that because Bush
has proposed new ethics legislation, which would require more
detailed information on assets, the president had decided to list
the specific amount of the trust, rounded off to the nearest $1,000.
   Other assets listed by Bush include: $1,000 in a White House
savings account, $3,000 in an interest-bearing checking account in
Kennebunkport; $28,000 in an individual retirement account for
himself and $2,300 in a companion IRA for Mrs. Bush.
   The forms also show a life insurance policy on Mrs. Bush with a
cash value of $13,000.
   They show that as of Dec. 31, Bush had about $6,000 in a regular
checking account in a Washington bank and about $5,000 in a
checking account in Houston.
   He also listed an $18,000 ``deferred compensation arrangement''
that he will get at age 65 _ this June _ from the Zapata Corp., the
now-defunct offshore oil drilling company he set up in Texas in the
late 1950s.
   Federal law requires that all gifts worth more than $100 be
reported.
   While the president and his wife may keep any gifts from
domestic sources, gifts from foreign sources cannot be kept if they
exceed $180 in value.
   Some of the gifts reported by Bush and his wife for 1988: Ten
country and western casette tapes from MCA Records, worth $100; two
sets of horseshoes worth $218 from Art Bellows of the Triangle
Corp. of Stamford, Conn.; a $425 pen set from Peter Bentley of
Parker Pens, Janesville, Wis., and two neckties worth $150 from
Roberto Goizueta, an executive of the Coca-Cola Co., Atlanta.
   Also: a cowboy hat and jacket, worth $124, from the Houston
Livestock Show; two pair of walking shoes from the Rockport Co.,
valued at $184; two pair of running shoes from Avia, worth $100; a
porcelain vase worth $120 from Li Changchun, an official in China's
Liaoning Provincial Government.
   Mrs. Bush reported a Tiffany gold watch, worth $7,800, from the
Ladies of the Senate Red Cross Chapter.
   Reported gifts also included more than a dozen paintings and
other original works of art, baseball and flight jackets, fishing
reels, various items of food, pillows, toy soldiers, a lamp,
several bowls, cosmetics, caviar, sweaters, workshirts, picture
frames, videotapes, a pool cue, an album of postage stamps and a
wine decanter.

   Japan formed a commission Monday to investigate
possible radiation from a U.S. hydrogen bomb lost in the Pacific 24
years ago. The Pentagon says pressure crushed the bomb and the
nuclear material dissolved.
   In a report Friday, the Pentagon said the 1-megaton bomb could
not have detonated at the time of the accident ``because the system
was designed not to arm or receive an arming command under this
accident circumstance.''
   The Defense Department told Japan in the four-paragraph report
``there is no environmental impact'' from the dissolved nuclear
material, which it said would have settled quickly to the ocean
floor 16,000 feet below.
   It did not specify the material in the bomb, but when details of
the accident were disclosed last week in Washington, researcher
William Arkin at the Institute of Policy Studies said it held 33
pounds of plutonium.
   That estimate was revised Monday to 5.5 pounds, said Shannon
Fagan of the environmental group Greenpeace, which worked on the
project with Arkin.
   An A-4 Skyhawk carrying the bomb slipped off the aircraft
carrier Ticonderoga in 1965 about 80 miles off an inhabited island
in Okinawa prefecture in far southern Japan. The location
previously had been kept secret.
   Japan, the only country ever attacked with nuclear weapons, is
especially sensitive on nuclear matters. In addition to the
question of radiation, the newly revealed accident raises the issue
of whether the United States sidesteps the Japanese ban on nuclear
weapons within its territory.
   At the time of the accident, the Ticonderoga was said to be
bound for the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka at the mouth of Tokyo Bay.
   Keizo Obuchi, the chief cabinet secretary, was asked by
reporters Monday whether the ship had docked at Yokosuka. He
replied: ``We have no confirmation at present, but we are inquiring
now.''
   Japan's anti-nuclear policy was not proclaimed until 1968, three
years after the accident.
   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno told a parliamentary committee
Japan accepts the U.S. evaluation that the material poses no
environmental danger, but said an investigation was necessary to
allay public fears.
   Later Monday, the Foreign Ministry appointed experts from
several agencies to evaluate the U.S. report and decide whether
more studies were needed. The experts are from the Defense Agency,
coast guard, Environmental Agency and fisheries authority.
   News of the lost bomb brought out demonstrators who demanded
elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty, under which about 60,000 U.S. military personnel
are based in Japan.
   The Japan Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which
supports the opposition Socialist Party, said the United States was
``making fools of the Japanese.''
   A statement by its secretary-general, Koichi Akamatsu, said the
government should ban all U.S. ships and planes unless they are
certified as not carrying nuclear weapons. The U.S. Navy refuses to
say whether its vessels carry nuclear arms when they enter Japanese
waters.
   Monday was the 17th anniversary of the U.S. turnover of Okinawa
to Japanese rule. The occasion was marked by peace rallies on the
island, which was the scene of heavy fighting in World War II.
   Japanese TV showed thousands of people listening to anti-nuclear
speeches.
   The Pentagon report responded to a request by Japan for
clarification after reports of the accident. A copy was provided to
The Associated Press on Monday.
   It said nuclear weapons specialists from the U.S. National
Laboratories had tested the nuclear material by dissolving it in
sea water.
   ``Because of its high density, the solute would have settled
very quickly to the floor of the ocean along with other
sedimentation,'' it said. ``Therefore, there is no environmental
impact.''
   It said the bomb was not designed to remain intact under the
heavy pressure of great ocean depths and the nuclear material would
have leaked out of the crushed casing.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Carlos Menem said
Monday he will not press to take office ahead of schedule, but his
advisers worry about how bad the economic crisis will become by
inauguration day in seven months.
   An 11 percent drop in the value of Argentina's currency soon
after foreign exchange houses opened Monday was a reminder that
economic problems need attention, but most of the loss was regained
during the day.
   The austral has lost 86 percent of its value against the dollar
since early February. Inflation was 9.6 percent in February, 17
percent in March, 33.4 percent in April, and is projected at 40
percent for May.
   Under the constitution, elections must be held at least four
months before inauguration, and the president has leeway in setting
the date. Critics said President Raul Alfonsin chose May 14 because
he thought the economy could be held together only until then.
   ``We're respectful of the law'' on timing, said Menem, whose
Peronist Party defeated Alfonsin's Radical Civic Union in the
elections Sunday and is to be inaugurated Dec. 10 for a six-year
term.
   He said he would address the nation within 15 days and announce
his Cabinet within a month.
   Speaking with reporters in La Rioja province, where he is
governor, Menem said his aides ``will be in permanent contact with
the government,'' to make the transition smooth, and he hoped his
election would end political certainty and stabilize economic
markets.
   Menem, 58, got 47.4 percent of the vote compared with 37 percent
for Eduardo Angeloz of Alfonsin's party, and 310 of the 600
presidential electors, the Interior Ministry said.
   It said 99 percent of the votes had been counted but did not
give totals or the turnout figure, which was estimated at 82
percent of those eligible.
   Earlier Monday, the ministry said Menem had 7,502,800 votes and
Angeloz 5,886,464 with 94 percent of the ballot boxes counted, and
candidates of several smaller parties got a total of 1.4 million.
   Peronists won 21 more Chamber of Deputies seats than in the
previous election for a total of 127, half the membership of
254-member chamber, the ministry said. Alliances with the Christian
Democrats and leftist Intransigent Party should provide regular
majorities.
   The party picked up a seat in the 46-member Senate, giving it
23, and will have the tie-breaking vote of Vice President-elect
Eduardo Duhalde. The Peronists also won 17 of the 22 provincial
governorships in elections in September.
   Alfonsin's party lost 14 deputies and now has 93 seats. Dante
Caputo, foreign minister and president of the U.N. General
Assembly, led the Radical slate and is assured of a seat in the
next Congress.
   In Washington, deputy State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said: ``These elections took place in an atmosphere of free and
open debate and under procedures in accord with Argentine
constitution.''
   Vatican radio expressed regret about the ``negative values'' it
said motivated Menem's campaign. It said the campaign stressed the
economic crisis in this predominantly Roman Catholic country and
tended to lay all Argentina's problems on the ``fragile shoulders''
of the Alfonsin government.
   Inflation has driven real wages down about 30 percent so far
this year and the government has kept public utility rates
artificially low, aggravating an already serious budget deficit.
Menem has promised pay increases.
   No payments have been made on the $59 billion foreign debt since
last year. Argentina is $2.5 billion behind on the interest.
   The balance of payments surplus, from which Argentina derives
most of its foreign currency, is likely to be substantially below
last year's $3.6 billion because of smaller grain havests due to
drought.
   Domingo Cavallo, a Harvard-trained economist who may be the next
treasury secretary, said: ``There are many things that have to be
done simultaneously, and for that I'm talking of a complete program
that has to have a date of application which, in principle, Dr.
Menem could only do after Dec. 10.
   ``But as the situation is so anguishing there would have to be a
way of putting it in motion by the government of Dr. Alfonsin
before that date.''
   Radical Civic Union leaders indicated Monday they would work
with Menem, whose views on economic policy sometimes clash with
Alfonsin's.
   While Alfonsin would sell state-owned industries to reduce the
deficit, Menem would try to increase their efficiency. Menem
opposes export taxes, which Alfonsin has used to generate revenue.
   Menem has not ruled out foreign exchange and price controls,
however. Alfonsin has used both to restrict inflation.

<HEAD>Commuters Struggle Through London Bus and Subway Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of commuters outmaneuvered a one-day bus
and subway strike in London on Monday, using staggered schedules,
bicycles and their feet to go about their business.
   Only 11 of the city's scores of subway trains and 10 buses
operated during the morning and evening rush hours as train
operators held their third unofficial strike and bus drivers struck
in a pay dispute.
   A sixth of the trains on British Rail's southern region also
were canceled because of an overtime ban by the unions and because
some employees were unable to get to work, the railroad said.
   Traffic jams were kept to a minimum because many drivers
staggered their trips, some leaving home at daybreak and others
departing from their jobs in midafternoon.
   ``We obviously saw traffic a little heavier because of the
general transport problem, but thanks to commuters staggering their
journeys we had very little real problem on London's roads,'' said
an Automobile Association spokesman.
   Many commuters found different ways to get to their jobs in
sunny weather, traveling by riverboats along the Thames, on
bicycles and afoot.
   The sidewalks were packed with pedestrians, and a steady stream
of rail commuters walked across the bridges over the Thames leading
from the main Waterloo train station into central London.
   A few stopped along the way to bathe in the sunshine or to wipe
their brows.
   The buses and subways carry about 7 million passengers daily.
   London Buses said service on about 250 of its routes was halted,
leaving only three in use in central London. Some 11,700 drivers
and conductors and 2,600 engineers were striking for more pay.
   On the London Underground with 248 subway stations, 2,500 train
drivers staged their third wildcat strike since April 5 to protest
cost-cutting measures.
   The drivers also are demanding more money for working on trains
that they eventually will operate alone after the planned phasing
out of conductors who open and close doors.

<HEAD>39-Year-Old Economist Becomes New Yugoslav President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SLOBODAN LEKIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Economist Janez Drnovsek on Monday became
the nation's first directly elected president and at age 39 its
youngest in history.
   Drnovsek became head of a collective presidency that faces huge
economic troubles and ethnic strains.
   ``We will strive to improve Yugoslavia's relations with the
developed nations, particularly with Europe,'' Drnovsek said in his
inaugural speech.
   He promised to push for further reforms in this non-aligned,
communist nation.
   Drnovsek, a little-known doctor of economic sciences and a
deputy representing Slovenia in the federal Parliament, last month
won a surprising 56 percent of votes in his liberal northern
republic.
   The collective presidency assembles representatives from
Yugoslavia's six constituent republics and two provinces. Under a
rotating system introduced in 1974, presidency members take turns
every year in filling the top post. This time the highest office
went to Slovenia.
   The elections in Slovenia featuring competing candidates were a
first for a republic here. Yugoslavia had been a one-party state.
   The new president has worked in industry and banking and has
broad experience in credit and monetary policies.
   In a recent speech, Drnovsek declared that democratization here
``has begun and cannot be halted'' anymore.
   Drnovsek succeeds Raif Dizdarevic, who will retire from politics.
   The collective presidency oversees the work of the government
and runs the country's foreign policy. It also serves as
commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
   Drnovsek delivered his address Monday in the Slovene language,
rather than the Serbo-Croatian spoken by most Yugoslavs and
normally used in political speeches.
   He has served notice he wants to become a strong president
taking an active part in political decision-making and economic
policies. Planned constitutional amendments would extend the
one-year term of the presidency head.
   Yugoslavia has yet to find an effective system to start reducing
its $21 billion foreign debt.
   Drnovsek believes in West European economic traditions at a time
of mounting pressure for introduction of greater political
democracy and closer ties with the West.
   Pressure has been growing from more than 1.1 million unemployed
young people for radical changes. Present economic reforms are
likely to increase unemployment, now over 15 percent. Living
standards have plunged by one third in the past decade. Inflation
surpassed 500 percent this month.
   Slovenia, the most industrialized and Westward-looking part of
the country, has been in the forefront of the democratization
process in Yugoslavia.
   A number of independent political groups, including a Social
Democratic Democratic Party, have sprung up in Slovenia in recent
months, and elections for the region's assembly to be contested by
opposition political parties are due to be held there next year.
   The southern republic of Macedonia and the central region of
Bosnia will not be represented on the newly inaugurated presidency,
pending a repeat of elections for their members on the collective
body.
   Official Communist-backed candidates were defeated in votes by
regional legislatures in April. General elections were scheduled
for June to fill the posts. Meanwhile, senior politicians will
temporarily represent the two republics on the state presidency.

   Severe thunderstorms developed Monday over the central and
southern Plains, over southern Florida where a tornado was
reported, and over the upper Ohio Valley and the central East Coast.
   Hail the size of half dollars pelted northeastern Oklahoma and
quarter-size hail fell on central Oklahoma. Dime-size hail fell
near the border of south-central Kansas and north-central Oklahoma.
   Wind gusted to 70 mph about 15 miles north of Cora, Okla., and
thunderstorms along the Texas coast produced wind gusts to 60 mph
near Palacios.
   Severe thunderstorms brought hail as big as golfballs to several
locations in southern Florida's Broward and Dade counties during
the afternoon. A tornado touched down in Pembroke Pines, the
National Weather Service reported.
   A line of strengthening showers and thunderstorms moved across
Virginia and western North Carolina. Heavy rain fell along sections
of the Carolina coast during the morning and Cape Hatteras, N.C.,
got 1.86 inches of rain in the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Thunderstorms produced small hail over parts of northeastern
Indiana during the morning.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended across Ohio and showers
were over Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh has had rain every day so far
this month, a record string of 15 days, for a total of 4.68 inches.
   In northern New Jersey, rainfall for the month has already gone
well past the average for the entire month of May. Charlotteburg,
N.J., has received 7.32 compared with a normal 4.65 inches, and
Newark has had 4.20 inches compared with a normal 3.59 for the
entire month.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms were widely scattered over parts of the
West, including southeastern Idaho, parts of Nevada and sections of
eastern and southern California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 37
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 95 at Avon Park,
Fla. Monday's low in the 48 contiguous states was 28 degrees at
Truckee, Calif.
   For Tuesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
over the lower Mississippi Valley, the great Plains, the Rockies
and the desert Southwest. Widely scattered thunderstorms were
forecast over southern Florida. Showers were forecast across the
middle and northern Atlantic Coast states, especially over New
England, eastern New York and northeastern Pennsylvania.
   Highs in the lower 80s were predicted near the Minnesota-Dakotas
border, over the middle Mississippi Valley, from the southern
Atlantic Coast across the Gulf Coast states to most of Texas, and
from the desert Southwest across interior California to
southwestern Oregon; in the 90s along the Rio Grande Valley of
Texas; and in the 60s and 70s across most of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   The savings and loan crisis has forced the
head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to neglect his job as
the main regulator of commercial banks and expose them to financial
danger, the head of a House subcommittee said Monday.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., one of the S&amp;L industry's
staunchest defenders as chairman of the House financial
institutions subcommittee, complained in a letter to FDIC Chairman
L. William Seidman that his agency has been turning over too many
of its duties to state bank examiners.
   ``I do not intend to stand by and allow your agency to create an
examination crisis in which the taxpayers will have to pay hundreds
of billions of dollars to solve a commercial bank crisis,''
Annunzio said. ``Congress cannot afford to permit any additional
slackening of bank examination and supervision.''
   Since Feb. 6 when Bush announced his S&amp;L bailout plan, the FDIC
has diverted more than one-fourth of staff of 2,029 bank examiners
to seize supervisory control of 220 insolvent or nearly insolvent
S&amp;Ls.
   In the interim, Annunzio said, the FDIC has told state banking
commissioners of ``significant reductions'' in its examinations of
most banks and has canceled training programs for state examiners.
   ``You testified that `we are confident we can handle both ...
long-term and short-term (savings and loan supervisory) roles
without undermining our bank supervisory activities,''' Annunzio
said in his letter to Seidman. ``These statements were made at the
same time you were abdicating your supervisory responsibilities.''
   Under S&amp;L legislation approved by the Senate and two House
committees, the FDIC would be given expanded powers to regulate
thrift institutions formerly under the authority of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board.
   Annunzio said he was going to hold hearings ``to reconsider''
that new authority in the wake of what the FDIC has told state
banking officials about limiting its examinations to only the
``most critical bank cases.''
   Alan Whitney, an FDIC spokesman, said a response to Annunzio's
letter had not yet been prepared but added, ``We're confident that
we can demonstrate that our statements were accurate.''
   Whitney conceded that examination schedules have been delayed
and that some training sessions for state examiners were postponed.
   ``We never denied this assignment that the president asked us to
undertake in February is putting a strain on our people and would
have some effect on our operations,'' he said.
   ``But we're confident that the examination of commercial banks
has not suffered because of it,'' added. ``No problem bank has had
its examination delayed by as much as a day.''
   The FDIC already has shifted back to bank examinations some of
the 550 examiners it had devoted to the most troubled S&amp;Ls in March
and through most of April, Whitney said.
   Prior to assuming its new role in the S&amp;L crisis, the FDIC had
planned to expand its examination staff by 200 people this year.
With the increased powers it is being given under the new
legislation, it plans to add another 450 to 600, Whitney said.

   The strike Monday by Los Angeles teachers is
by far the largest teacher walkout this school year, apparently
illegal and a rarity in its proximity to the end of the school year.
   ``We were planning to be legal, but technically I guess we're
not,'' Catherine Carey, a spokeswoman for the teacher's union,
United Teachers-Los Angeles, said in a telephone interview Monday.
   The union represents 32,000 teachers, librarians, nurses and
counselors in the nation's second-largest school district, with
about 22,000 of them dues-paying members of the union. The district
has 594,000 students.
   The strike is the largest by teachers since 28,000 Chicago
teachers struck in the 1987-88 school year, affecting 430,000
students.
   According to the National Education Association, the nation's
largest teachers union, only seven states allow teachers to strike
without the risk of penalties: Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio,
Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
   An additional 13 allow teachers to strike at the risk of being
penalized. They are Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee.
   ``It's pretty murky,'' Carey said when asked to describe
California laws governing teacher strikes.
   She said strikes were allowed if the union and school board
first went through mediation and a fact-finding process and
teachers honored a mandatory 10-day cooling off period after the
fact-finder issued a report.
   Such a report was due Monday in the Los Angeles impasse, but the
fact-finder requested a two-day extension. The union had set a May
30 strike deadline, which would have allowed the 10-day cooling off
period, but moved the deadline to Monday when Superintendent
Leonard Britton refused to authorize pay for teachers who failed to
turn in final grades by Monday.
   ``He kind of moved things up on us,'' Carey said. ``We were
planning to be legal. ... We'll let the powers that be and the
courts decide whether we're legal or illegal. If it's deemed
illegal, we're willing to pay the penalty.''
   The California Public Employee Relations Board said last week
that teachers would be violating the law if they struck Monday. But
school officials have given no indication that they plan to take
legal action against the strikers.
   Carolyn Wallace, an official at the NEA's national headquarters
here who tracks teacher strikes, said there had been 68 nationwide
as of April 20.
   ``It's very rare,'' she said when asked about the timing of the
Los Angeles strike, which came five weeks before the end of the
school year.
   The Public Policy Research Foundation, a conservative
organization that publishes a newsletter on developments in public
employee unions, said its preliminary data showed there have been
71 teacher strikes this year in 12 states, not including the Los
Angeles walkout. There were 19,647 teachers involved in all of
those strikes combined _ fewer than in Los Angeles _ and 250,337
students were idled, according to the foundation, which counts
students as being affected by a strike only if schools are closed
for more than one day.
   Wallace said the foundation figures include strikes by
non-teaching support personnel.

   Ambassador Arthur Davis, recalled by
President Bush, left Panama on Monday and accused Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega of trying to assassinate an opposition vice
presidential candidate.
   Davis said attacks by pipe-wielding thugs at a rally Wednesday
were aimed at Guillermo Ford, candidate for second vice president.
   ``The attack was meant to kill him,'' Davis said before leaving
for Howard Air Force Base to fly home.
   He called the attack ``a deliberate, Noriega-directed attempt''
and said, ``There is clear evidence Noriega's goons did it.''
   Later, at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, Davis said
a member of the so-called ``Dignity Battalion'' leaned into Ford's
car with a pistol and ``fired away.''
   ``You don't put a gun into the side of an automobile and fire
unless you're planning to kill somebody,'' he said. One of Ford's
bodyguards was slain.
   Asked about the link between the Dignity Battalion and Noriega,
Panama's de facto leader, Davis replied: ``Well, they're his men.
Nobody else ordered it except Noriega. The Dignity Battalions are
under his control.''
   Ford told journalists in Panama: ``There's no doubt in my mind
that they really tried to shoot me,'' but said he had no
independent knowledge that any one person ordered it done.
   ``I'm not saying (Davis) is wrong,'' he said. ``I'm just giving
you my version.''
   Bush ordered Davis home after Panama nullified the results of
the May 7 presidential election.
   The government stopped the vote count and nullified the
election, claiming a 2-1 edge for its candidate, Carlos Duque,
hand-picked by Noriega.
   Figures from exit polls and opposition poll watchers gave
opposition candidate Guillermo Endara and vice presidential
candidates Ford and Ricardo Arias Calderon an edge of about 3-1.
   Davis cited witness reports and the nature of wounds suffered by
Ford and his bodyguards but would not reveal the source of any
other evidence that Noriega ordered Ford killed.
   The ambassador left the embassy in charge of the deputy chief of
mission, John Maisto. He said he would return ``when conditions
permit the re-establishment of normal relations between the United
States and a legitimate government.''
   He said Noriega, not the Panama Defense Forces he leads, is the
problem and it may be up to the military to get rid of him.
   ``I know there are honorable, professional officers and soldiers
in the PDF who deplore the cowardly use of violence against their
own unarmed people,'' Davis said. ``It must be quite a decision for
them to continue (working) when they see what happened on May 10.''
   Davis would not say whether he would recommend direct U.S.
military intervention if diplomatic efforts or elements within the
Defense Forces could not oust Noriega.
   He said he hoped a special meeting of the Organization of
American States set for Wednesday in Washington would insist the
results of the elections be honored and issue ``a strong
condemnation of the Noriega regime.''
   Panama's opposition has said the OAS should put a political and
diplomatic quarantine on Panama if the government does not
recognize an opposition victory.
   In Washington, the State Department said a growing list of
countries condemning Panama included Argentina, Belize, Canada,
Costa Rica, Dominica, El Salvador, West Germany, Guatemala, Japan,
Mexico, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, Spain, Trinidad, Great
Britain, Uruguay and Venezuela.
   President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela offered Noriega
asylum. ``Gen. Noriega has not asked us for asylum, but if that is
the solution for Panama, then Venezuela will open its doors,'' said
Perez, a harsh critic of the general.
   Arias Calderon, opposition candidate for first vice president,
said Monday he hoped for a solution from within the military.
   ``I believe the independence of a growing number of the military
will be a contribution to the solution,'' he said. ``We have allies
within the military, people who want a change. I personally do not
view the military as enemies.''
   Endara, Ford and Calderon were beaten at the end of a political
parade Wednesday. Davis said quick action by Ford's bodyguards
saved his life.
   Hospital officials said Endara, the only one of the three
hospitalized, probably would be released by Wednesday.
   The opposition has called a one-day general strike for Wednesday
to protest the voiding of the election.
   In an apparent attempt to derail the protest, the government
announced Wednesday would be payday for 140,000 public employees.
Their payday normally would have been Monday.
   American children at military bases returned to school Monday.
The schools closed Friday while American dependents moved onto
military bases for safety.
   Under the Panama Canal Treaties of 1977, Panama is to get
complete control of the canal on Dec. 31, 1999, and U.S. bases are
to close.
   Noriega, who is under indictment on drug charges in the United
States, contends the accusations are a ploy to get rid of him and
keep the canal.

   A British legislator said Monday that Libyan
authorities have suggested he visit Beirut to discuss the release
of hostages held in Lebanon by Moslem kidnappers.
   Ron Brown, Labor Party member of Parliament, made public a
letter he said he received from the Libyan government thanking him
for a communication and offering to ``do anything you recommend to
secure the release of individuals held hostage.''
   The letter expressed opposition to terrorism and said, ``We
invite you to visit Beirut to discuss your proposals with our local
representative.''
   Britain broke diplomatic relations with Libya in April 1984
after a policewoman was fatally shot during a demonstration by
dissident Libyans outside Libya's embassy in London. Britain said
she was killed by a Libyan shooting from inside the embassy.
   Brown has links with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi and has
helped gain the release of several Britons who were detained in
Libya.
   Gadhafi has repeatedly denied claims by the United States and
some Western European that his government supports international
terrorism. Some of the hostages in Lebanon are believed to be held
by pro-Iranian terrorists.
   British hostages believed held in Beirut are Terry Waite, the
archbishop of Canterbury's special envoy; journalist John McCarthy
and Brian Keenan, a teacher with dual Irish-British nationality. A
fourth Briton, Jack Mann, disappeared in Beirut Friday and his wife
said she feared he had been kidnapped.
   Twelve other foreign hostages were kidnapped in Lebanon,
including nine Americans. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, has been held the longest.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   The army put 700,000 Palestinians in the
occupied Gaza Strip under indefinite curfew Monday and ordered all
Gazans working in Israel to return to the seaside area immediately,
a military spokesman said.
   Soldiers blew up or sealed the homes of 15 Arabs suspected of
anti-Israel attacks.
   The curfew order followed clashes in Gaza on Monday between
stone-throwers and soldiers. At Khan Yunis refugee camp,
40-year-old Fadel Ahmed Ihnadik was fatally shot in the chest, Arab
hospital officials said.
   His death raised to 475 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising against Israeli rule began in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip more than 17 months ago. Twenty-one Israelis also
have been slain.
   Military officials gave no reason for the order to laborers from
Gaza, the first of its kind in the uprising. Many Palestinians
employed in Israel prefer to spend the night near their jobs rather
than return home, where they can be caught in strikes or army
curfews.
   Under the curfew, Gazans must remain at home unless told
otherwise. Under similar curfews, residents have been allowed a
two-hour shopping period later.
   ``If people are supposed to be under curfew they should not run
around, and that pertains to those working in Israel too,'' a
military spokesman said, and the curfew would continue ``until
further notice.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Palestinians in Gaza City began shouting ``Allahu Akbar!'' (God
is Great) from windows soon after the curfew was announced over
army loudspeakers, an Arab reporter said.
   Soldiers wounded at least 24 Palestinians in half a dozen
confrontations Monday with soldiers in the Gaza Strip, hospital
officials said.
   In one clash at Khan Yunis, a 6-year-old girl was reported shot
in the left shoulder and a 50-year-old man was in serious condition
with a gunshot wound in the back, doctors said.
   At least 11 other people were wounded in the camp, and about 26
were injured by rubber bullets or tear gas inhalation, doctors
said. The army said it was checking the casualty reports.
   Troops demolished four houses and sealed nine others to punish
Palestinians accused of attacking Israeli troops or killing
suspected collaborators with Israel, the army spokesman's office
said.
   Six sealed homes were in Nablus, the West Bank's largest city.
The city's 120,000 residents were put under curfew to prevent
protests, the army said.
   Later Monday, two houses were demolished in the Aqabat Jabr
refugee camp that houses 3,000 Palestinians near the West Bank town
of Jericho.
   The military said the houses belonged to members of a guerrilla
squad suspected of killing an Arab policeman last year because he
refused to quit his job.
   Western nations, including the United States, have condemned
house demolitions and sealings as a violation of the right to due
process because the punishment usually comes before trial.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, army commander of the West Bank,
defended it on Israel radio Monday as a deterrent.
   Since the start of the uprising, more than 178 houses have been
demolished and at least 77 others sealed in the territories,
according to army figures.
   Meanwhile, army Deputy Chief of Staff Ehud Barak told the
Israeli Supreme Court the use of plastic bullets since August has
reduced deaths.
   Plastic bullets are designed to be less lethal than lead bullets
when fired from a distance of 70 yards or more.
   Barak said in the first eight months of the uprising, 204
Palestinians were killed by army gunfire. In the eight months after
plastic bullets were introduced, Palestinian deaths totaled 154, of
which 61 were from plastic ammunition, he said.
   Barak was responding to a petition filed by Felicia Langer, an
Israeli lawyer who has defended Palestinian activists.
   Langer asked the court to decide whether restrictions should be
put on the army's use of plastic bullets. Under army regulations,
plastic bullets, unlike lead rounds, can be fired when a soldier's
life is not in danger.
   Shops and businesses were shuttered throughout the occupied
territories in a general strike called by the PLO-backed leaders of
the uprising.
   It marked what the leaders termed the ``Palestinian
catastrophe'' _ displacement of more than 600,000 Palestinians
after the founding of Israel on May 15, 1948.
   In Jerusalem, the government began diplomatic steps to promote a
peace initiative approved Sunday by the Israeli Cabinet, which
calls for Palestinian elections of representatives to negotiate an
interim peace plan with Israel.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens met Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed
Bassiouny and was to leave Tuesday for Washington. Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin also is going to Washington and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir will visit Britain and Spain.

<TEXT>
   A Senate investigating committee on Monday
accused the Indian Health Service of purposely trying to impede the
panel's probe of allegedly misappropriated funds and other
irregularities within the agency.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said none of eight other
government agencies being investigated by his special committee has
been as difficult to deal with.
   ``The Indian Health Service has been singularly uncooperative
with our committee's investigation,'' he said. Sen. Thomas Daschle,
D-S.D., said the agency's actions amounted to ``stonewalling.''
   Officials of the health service were scheduled to testify
Monday, but DeConcini said the committee was not ready to begin its
questioning because the agency had not supplied requested
information until Friday.
   Dr. Everett Rhoades, the service's director, told reporters
after the committee meeting that the agency should have been more
forthcoming and said the committee's March 2 letter requesting
documents had not come immediately to his attention.
   By the time he learned of the letter, he said, the amount of
work involved in meeting the request was ``astronomical.''
   ``The material was out in the field,'' Rhoades said. ``It took
time to gather.'' Nonetheless, he said, he had directed his
subordinates to give the committee everything it wanted.
   Rhoades said his agency has always been cooperative.
   The special committee of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs has been conducting a wide-ranging investigation of
Indians, the federal agencies that serve them and private
industries with whom they do business.
   During three weeks in February and last week, the panel has
brought under intense questioning the heads of the government
agencies with responsibilities to native Americans.
   DeConcini said that all the other agencies came forth
voluntarily, but that ``if the committee does not receive
cooperation from this point forward, we will consider subpoenaing
IHS for documents and testimony.''
   He said documents the committee requested 10 weeks ago were not
delivered by the health service until Friday night, ``less than 72
hours before this hearing.''
   He said the 7,000 pages of documents came in stacks, without an
index and seemingly unorganized.
   ``This weekend, the committee received information suggesting
that a possible witness may have been subjected to pressure not to
fully cooperate with the committee,'' said DeConcini. ``We clearly
need to investigate this allegation further.''
   Among the witnesses who did appear before the committee Monday
was the deputy inspector general of the criminal division of the
Department of Health and Human Services, Larry Morey, who said
complaints he has investigated alleging misuse of funds indicated a
possible pattern of abuse at IHS.
   He said $70,000 designated for an alcohol abuse program for
Indians was used for a ``retreat'' for top officials from the IHS
office serving Albuquerque, N.M.
   He said the case was new and still under investigation, but not
unusual among the kinds of complaints his office has received.
   Ken Ballen, chief counsel for the committee, said committee
investigators have determined that the retreat was held at a resort
near Santa Fe and included massage therapy for the participants,
only two of whom were tribal officials.
   After the hearing, Rhoades defended the gathering as an
educational experience for IHS officials who need ``to change how
they regard themselves'' before they can help others.
   He said about 50 people participated in the program designed to
promote ``wellness.''
   ``Massage therapy is a widely accepted treatment modality'' for
alcoholism, he said.

   Space shuttle Atlantis returned to
its launch site here Monday night after a 2{-day odyssey atop a
NASA Boeing 747 jetliner that was forced to make three bad weather
stops.
   The jumbo jet touched down here at 8:09 p.m., minutes after
sunset.
   Atlantis and its five-person crew landed at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., last Monday after a four-day space mission that sent
the Magellan spacecraft on the way to explore the planet Venus.
   Bolted atop the 747, Atlantis left Edwards on Saturday for what
is normally a seven-hour flight, with one refueling stop, to the
Kennedy Space Center here.
   But bad storms over central Texas forced the 747 to land at
Biggs Army Air Field near El Paso, Texas. It sat on the ground
there Saturday and Sunday nights, waiting for the weather to clear.
   The flying duo took off Monday morning and landed at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport, waiting there for a few hours while
forecasters assessed the weather between Texas and Florida.
   With a threat of thunderstorms in central Florida, NASA decided
to fly the 747 into Warner Robbins Air Force Base near Macon, Ga.,
and again look at the weather.
   Officials were just about to give up on getting here Monday, and
the 747 crew even began removing its bags for an overnight stay in
Georgia. But with the Florida clouds clearing, NASA sent a T-38 jet
plane to survey the flight path.
   Given the all-clear, the crew reloaded its bags on the plane and
it took off for the 90-minute final leg, landing on a 15,000-foot
runway near the shuttle launch pad.
   The delay in returning Atlantis could hasten the day when NASA
decides to again return shuttles to Earth on the runway here. All
landings have been in California since 1985, when a shuttle blew a
tire here at touchdown. Officials have said they will continue to
return shuttles to wide-open and safer Edwards until new brake and
steering systems have been thoroughly tested.
   Atlantis now will be readied for another planetary mission, to
propel the Galileo spacecraft toward Jupiter in October.

<TEXT>
   The famed 21 Club's secret wine cellar, where
Prohibition guests downed drinks behind the protection of a
4,000-pound secret door, opened Monday night as a sanctuary for
well-heeled diners.
   Inside, a single table set with sparkling silver and a floral
centerpiece sat amid floor-to-ceiling racks of wine bottles and a
wooden booth where high-living Mayor Jimmy Walker used to knock
back a few in the 1920s.
   But intimacy, nostalgia and a six-course supper don't come cheap
in the exclusive midtown Manhattan restaurant's one-table sanctum.
   ``Prices start for dinner at $350 a head, and that includes a
selection of wines we would recommend,'' said Ken Aretsky, chairman
of the 21 Club.
   Getting to the cellar, however, is no elegant trip.
   Guests must pass through the ground-floor bar into the bustling
kitchen, down a steep flight of steps to the basement and through a
narrow hallway to a suspicious-looking recess off to the side.
   Fifty-five years ago, the recess was hidden by pipes and hams,
Aretsky said.
   A tap on the wall indicates nothing unusual. But when chief
sommelier Matt Siegel sticks a long, slender steel rod into a tiny
hole _ Voila! _ the secret 4,000-pound brick door opens.
   Diners have one more secret door to go before reaching the
cellar and a table that can accommodate up to 12 gourmets.
   During Prohibition, federal agents once searched 10 hours for
the first door, Siegel said.
   ``They knocked on the walls and lit matches to find a draft,''
but never found it, he said proudly.

Monday.
   ``I've been working ... to get Dylan for years,'' said Jay

open the tour in the Midwest and at a place that was private and
quiet and could still technically handle his show needs.''
   Goldberg said $20 tickets for the July 1 show at the 9,000-seat
Civic Center Arena would go on sale Saturday. He predicted a quick
sellout in the town famed for the show-business phrase, ``Will it

   Police on Monday dismissed as false a claim by an
underground Scottish nationalist group that it firebombed a quarry
in an anti-nuclear protest.
   Investigations showed the Saturday night fire that seriously
damaged a stone-crushing plant in Glensanda quarry near Oban on the
west coast of Scotland was accidental, said a spokesman for the
Northern Police region.
   After the fire, an anonymous caller to the domestic Press
Association news agency in London claimed to represent the Scottish
National Liberation Army and said the group bombed the quarry
because it was being developed as a site for dumping civilian and
military nuclear waste.
   Scottish government officials said the allegation about nuclear
waste was untrue.
   No one was injured in the firebombing.
   The Scottish National Liberation Army is a shadowy nationalist
group that has sent letter bombs to government officials, including
Prime Minster Margaret Thatcher and Malcolm Rifkind, secretary for
Scotland. Police accused it of bombing a London army barracks in
1983, slightly injuring five people.

   A military tribunal on Monday
indicted 13 officers on charges of treason and rebellion in
connection with a failed attempt last week to topple the civilian
government.
   Col. Ramon Pantaleon Palencia, head of the tribunal, said nine
active duty officers and four retired officers were indicted. He
refused to release their names. Two more officers involved in the
coup attempt are at large and were not charged, he said.
   Pantaleon said the tribunal has 15 days to examine the evidence
and decide whether to continue the legal proceedings or drop the
charges.
   Troops loyal to Guatemala's 3-year-old civilian government put
down the May 9 coup attempt within hours and without firing a shot.
It was the second coup attempt led by rebellious military officers
in a year.
   President Vinicio Cerezo and Defense Minister Alejandro Gramajo
said rebel air force troops backed by two helicopter gunships and
an A-37 warplane blocked two major highways and tried to march on
Gramajo's house.
   They turned back in the face of a superior force of loyalist
troops, they said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Refuseniks could suffer if the U.S.
eases its human rights pressure on the Soviet Union, a former
refusenik who waited 18 years to secure an exit visa told Vice
President Dan Quayle on Monday.
   ``If you want to open the society, you must press them to their
obligations,'' Yuli Kosharovsky, 47, once the longest-term Jewish
refusenik in the USSR, told Quayle and Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.,
during a half-hour meeting here.
   Smith, a member of the Helsinki Commission, helped Kosharovsky
in his battle to receive permission to leave the Soviet Union.
   The three discussed human rights, anti-Semitism and larger
East-West issues. Kosharovsky, a former engineer, said the Soviet
Union must make its emigration law conform with its international
obligations.
   ``I expressed the main idea: we must judge Russians not
according to propaganda, but as to real deeds,'' said Kosharovsky.
   The former radio electronics engineer presented Quayle with a
list of eight refuseniks with whom he shares personal ties.
   ``He (Quayle) was really interested in understanding how the
whole process of perestroika works,'' Kosharovsky said. ``In
practical terms for ordinary people, perestroika doesn't go over.
There's not enough food, not enough goods.''
   Kosharovsky, who had worked until 1968 with intercontinental
ballistic missiles, quit his high-security job in 1968 and began a
three-year wait to apply for an exit visa.
   Beginning in 1971, he was systematically denied the right to
leave on the basis of national security. Soviet authorities
imprisoned him more than 200 times and accused him of agitating
prisoners against the Soviet regime. He held a series of menial
jobs, all the while teaching Hebrew at his apartment and organizing
classes in other cities.
   ``They couldn't break my spine, so they kept us in as miserable
condition as possible,'' Kosharovsky said. ``I was told all the
time, `Maybe the next day is your last day.' The Soviet KGB is very
good, they know how to get the soul of a person.''
   The bearded Hebrew teacher represented Soviet refuseniks at
Spaso House in Moscow when former President Ronald Reagan met with
Mikhail Gorbachev during the 1988 summit. Kosharovsky said despite
a series of KGB searches, he kept a postcard of Smith, Reagan and
then-Vice President George Bush on his wall.
   ``It was my talisman, really,'' he said.
   ``Keep your courage and hope alive. Remember, we both serve a
God of miracles,'' Smith, who first became involved in
Kosharovsky's case in 1982, had written on the back.
   Kosharovsky finally won his visa March 10 of this year as a
result of continued pressure from Reagan, Bush, members of Congress
and the National Conference on Soviet Jewry.
   Kosharovsky arrived in Israel on March 12 with his family, and
plans to continue to press for Soviet emigration from his new home.
He cautioned that glasnost, the new Soviet openness, and the
economic reforms promulgated through perestroika, remain on shaky
ground.
   ``U.S. political language makes Mr. Gorbachev as bold as he is.
He wants to be acceptable to the family of Western democracy. The
whole process (of political reform) is so unstable, the reforms so
inconsistent with what came before,'' he said.
   Kosharovsky said the so-called new religious freedom really is
more a matter of authorities turning their heads the other way.
   ``Authorities don't interfere, but they don't recognize
(religion),'' he said.
   Although more Soviet Jews are winning exit visas, said
Kosharovsky, the authorities ``perpetuate the institution of
long-term refuseniks. They try to manipulate the emigration.''
   Smith reiterated his support for the Jackson-Vanik amendment
that ties trade to human rights, despite Bush's recent proposal to
ease it to encourage greater trade between the superpowers.
   ``My feeling is it's an important and fundamental element of our
policy to press it. I think it's important we keep it on the books.
If a true pattern emerges of liberalization, then Jackson-Vanik can
be waived as we do for Hungary and Poland,'' Smith said.

<TEXT>
   More than 20,000 teachers in the nation's
second-largest school district went on strike Monday, demanding
more pay and more say in running schools.
   More than one-fourth of the district's 554,000 students stayed
home or walked out of class at the 600 schools in the
700-square-mile Los Angeles district. It was the first strike in 19
years for the district, which has five weeks of classes remaining.
   About 500 hastily hired substitutes and another 500
administrators joined teachers who crossed picket lines and regular
substitutes.
   Teachers were asked by their union to withhold grades and
attendance records from the district, which demanded the files by
Monday or threatened to dock pay.
   Incidents such as blocked entrances and a substitute teacher
running her car into a fence were reported, but there were no
arrests or injuries.
   Students who reported to class had a slow day thanks to absences
or exoduses by their peers. The entire student body walked out at
Belmont High School and an estimated 300 to 400 students walked out
of North Hollywood High School, the district said.
   ``We're going to be stuck in a gym. All we're gonna do is sit
and vegetate,'' said Maureen Lim, a 15-year-old Hamilton High
School freshman, as teachers marched in front of the building.
   District spokeswoman Diana Munatones said of the district's
594,000 reported students, 40,000 were not enrolled full time this
semester. Of the remaining 554,000 students, 430,000, or about 72
percent, showed up for roll call on Monday. The district earlier in
the day forecast substantially greater absences nearing the 50
percent mark.
   School board president Roberta Weintraub said 20,000 to 22,000
teachers failed to report out of 32,000.
   Munatones said later that the board increased substitute
teacher's pay by $30 to $167 daily. She did not explain where the
money for the extra pay came from but said it was ``because of the
extreme emergency conditions.''
   Weintraub said the district has made the best offer, and ``the
ball is in the union's court.''
   Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, which
represents 22,000 of the district's teachers, nurses and
counselors, called administrators' promises to keep schools
operating with substitutes ``a joke, at best.''
   Johnson said more informal talks would take place, but no formal
negotiations were set.
   ``I'm hopeful that it wn't go more than two or three days,'' he
said of the strike.
   The district most recently offered a 21.5 percent raise over
three years. It also offered to set up councils giving teachers a
greater role in the curriculum. The union says administrators would
still have too much power since teachers are the ones blamed when
students perform poorly.
   Teachers' salries range from a beginning $23,440 to $43,319 for
those with doctorates, 98 extra course units and 19 years'
experience.
   The teachers want a 21 percent raise over two years and relief
from unpaid duties such as playground patrol and staff meetings. In
March they overwhelmingly rejected an offer for a 20 percent pay
raise over three years.
   Negotiations by then had deadlocked and the dispute was
submitted to a state fact-finder, who will present a report
Wednesday.
   State schools chief William Honig accused the union of striking
too hastily in order to use grades to force a settlement.
   Senior David Stillman, sitting idle on the steps of Hamilton
High, where he will be valedictorian, said, ``I am upset with the
teachers for using us a pawns. I agree with what the teachers are
doing, but not how they are doing it.''
   At Castle Heights Elementary School, Michael Pollak dropped off
5-year-old son Joshua and said he hoped for the best.
   ``I don't anticipate any trouble,'' he said. ``I suppose I'm
like most parents and want the strike to be resolved as quickly as
possible so my child's education is not disrupted.''
   The situation was quiet there, but elsewhere the district
claimed school entrances were blocked by strikers, substitutes
faced threats of broken car windows, and milk and trash trucks
refused to cross picket lines at Venice High School.
   Glue was found in locks at Birmingham High School. A substitute
ran her car into a fence at Roosevelt High School.

   President Ali Khamenei of Iran was quoted
as saying at a meeting Monday with the president of North Korea
that anti-Americanism could be the the most important factor in
cooperation between their countries.
   His statement to President Kim Il-Sung was broadcast by Tehran
Radio, monitored in Nicosia.
   Khamenei, now on a tour of the Far East, said the United States
was hostile to progressive countries and threatened progressive
governments in different parts of the world, according to the radio.
   ``This threat is particularly aimed at you and us.
Anti-Americanism can be the most important factor in our
cooperation with the People's Democratic Republic of Korea,''
Khamenei was quoted as saying.
   ``I have repeatedly stressed to your envoys that among the
reasons why Iran is close to Korea is the U.S.A.'s enmity toward
both our countries.
   ``If big countries threaten progressive countries, then
progressive countries should threaten them in turn. ... You have
proved in Korea that you have the power to confront America.''
   North Korea was reportedly a steadfast arms supplier to Iran
throughout the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war, when a Western arms
embargo virtually isolated Iran. Khamenei arrived in the North
Korean capital of Pyongyang from China, Iran's other main arms
supplier.
   Iranian is reportedly spending up to $5 billion a year on new
weapons despite postwar economic hardships. Communist North Korea
and fundamentalist Moslem Iran are both strongly anti-Western.
   North Korea hopes to pick up lucrative post-war reconstruction
projects in Iran. The war ended in a United Nations-sponsored
cease-fire last August.
   With a resurgence of anti-Western sentiment following the Salman
Rushdie case, Iran has been strengthening relations with
non-Western industrialized nations that could help rebuild its
devastated industries.
   Khamenei's tour Monday included a ride on the city subway system.
   In February, Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed
that Indian-born British writer Rushdie blasphemed against Islam in
his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' and should be killed.
   North Korea supported the death call.

   Vice President Dan Quayle's chief of staff,
Robert M. Guttman, is resigning at the end of June, a spokesman for
Quayle said Monday.
   Guttman, 60, will be replaced by Bill Kristol, 36, the son of
conservative social thinker Irving Kristol, Quayle spokesman Dave
Beckwith said Monday night.
   An official announcement was planned for Tuesday, but the
Indianapolis News was reporting on the story in its Monday editions.
   ``He said basically the office was up and running and that he
was more interested in analysis of policy rather than either
administration or politics,'' said Beckwith. Guttman, a career
government employee, will be looking for work in the private
sector, Beckwith said.
   Before becoming chief of staff a month before the inauguration,
Guttman was minority counsel on the subcommittee on labor in the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, where Quayle served. He
was chief counsel to Quayle from 1984-86 in the Senate.
   Before joining Quayle's Senate staff, Guttman worked for more
than a decade at the Congressional Research Service and 15 years
with the Department of Labor.
   As Quayle's chief of staff, Guttman supervises a staff of about
80, Beckwith said.
   A native of Munich, West Germany, Guttman graduated from Harvard
University and did graduate work at George Washington University.
   Kristol was chief of staff and counselor to Education Secretary
William Bennett during the Reagan administration. Also a Harvard
graduate, Kristol formerly taught politics.

   A school bus crashed into a tree Monday,
injuring the driver and 16 students in an accident authorities said
had haunting similarities to a church bus collision that killed 27
people a year ago.
   The accident on a narrow, winding stretch occurred a year and a
day after the church bus crash about 20 miles away near Carrollton.
   ``The first thing I thought about was the Carrollton crash,''
county schools superintendent David Griffith said. ``It scared the
heck out of me.''
   Sheriff Barry Alexander said the impact broke a front-axle leaf
spring on the bus and jarred it to within about eight inches of the
gas tank.
   The same axle part punctured the gas tank of the church bus when
it collided with a truck, causing an explosion and fire, said
rescuers who were at both accident scenes.
   ``It was a godsend they were not more seriously injured,'' the
sheriff said of Monday's accident. He said the bus skidded off a
rain-slick road before crashing into a tree at the bottom of a
hill, Alexander said.
   When the crash occurred about 7:30 a.m., the bus was just
beginning its route, Griffith said. When fully loaded, 40 to 50
children are aboard, he said.
   Griffith said he didn't blame the driver, Reggie Alexander, 39,
no relation to Sheriff Alexander. ``The first thing he said to me
in the hospital was, `Gee, I'm sorry for the kids,''' Griffith said.
   Hospital officials reported that 15 children were treated and
released for bumps and bruises, Reggie Alexander was in fair
condition with chest and abdominal injuries, and an 8-year-old girl
was in fair condition with a broken leg.
   The Carrolton crash was the nation's deadliest
drunken-driving-related traffic accident. The driver of the truck,
Larry W. Mahoney, faces trial in November on 27 counts of murder
and one count of drunken driving.

   Alice-Leone Moats, an author and columnist
for The Philadelphia Inquirer who settled here after a career
abroad that included coverage of World War II, has died at age 81.
   Miss Moats, known among friends as ``Moatsie,'' died Sunday at
Graduate Hospital. She had been ill with heart disease and other
ailments.
   The author of nine published books and hundreds of magazine
articles, she devoted much of the last 12 years to her weekly
column, which was syndicated.
   She developed a wide following for her witty, often cutting
commentary.
   ``She could really bring the saber out and put it to good use,''
said Phil Joyce, editor of the Inquirer's commentary page. ``She
had people looking for that column every week. I knew. When we
didn't run it, I would hear. I think a lot of people looked at her
as a lovable sort of cranky person.''
   Born in Mexico to American parents, Miss Moats grew up a
privileged only child and early in her career became known as an
expert on courtesy.
   Her 1933 book, ``No Nice Girl Swears,'' a practical guide to
etiquette for young girls, became a best-seller when it was
published and was reissued 50 years later.
   She arrived in Moscow in 1941 as a correspondent for Collier's
magazine, and went to Spain in 1943 as a correspondent for
Collier's, the New York Herald Tribune and CBS.
   She continued to work abroad until 1974, when she returned to
the United States and eventually settled in Philadelphia.
   Miss Moats had no survivors in her immediate family.

<HEAD>Bush Presents Anti-Crime Proposals, Bans Imported Assault Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: SUBS 13th graf, Some of..., to clarify that ban covers clips
of more than 15 rounds, not 15 or more. ^By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush proposed a $1.2 billion
anti-crime plan Monday to build more prison cells, toughen
sentencing for gun-related crimes and ban semiautomatic ammunition
clips of more than 15 rounds in an effort to ``take back the
streets'' from criminals.
   He declined to call for a ban on U.S.-produced semiautomatic
assault-style rifles _ a favorite weapon of drug traffickers _ but
said he would make permanent a ban on many of their imported
counterparts.
   In measures expected to be popular with law enforcement
officials, he called for a minimum 10-year sentence for using
semiautomatic weapons during a crime, and an end to the dropping of
gun-use charges through plea bargaining.
   He also recommended more money for federal law enforcement
agents and prosecutors and an expansion in the number of federal
crimes calling for the death penalty.
   Both sides in the gun-control debate objected to parts of the
package.
   But Bush said it would send a message to criminals: ``We're
going to take back the streets.''
   ``For far too long, a privileged class of violent and repeat
offenders have calculated that crime really does pay, that our
criminl justice system is a crapshoot where the risks are worth the
rewards. Well, it's time we change the odds and up the stakes
enormously,'' the president said in a speech at a National Peace
Officers' Memorial Service.
   Bush stood in the rain at the Capitol before an audience that
included more than 700 relatives of the 161 officers killed in the
line of duty nationwide last year. Also present were uniformed
officers from around the country.
   Two Democratic senators quickly found fault with Bush's
proposal, Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio saying he was ``disappointed
that the president chose to limit his action'' on semiautomatics to
imported weapons, and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina declaring
that if Bush were serious about the recommendations he would have
said where the money was going to come from.
   The National Rifle Association, the nation's largest gun lobby,
applauded Bush's proposals to get tougher on criminals but
criticized his steps to restrict assault weapons.
   ``We don't see a heck of a difference between a 15-round
magazine and three five-round magazines other than about the two
seconds it takes to change from one to another,'' said James Baker,
the NRA's chief lobbyist in Washington. ``That's not going to have
an effect on criminals.''
   An administration official, commenting on condition he not be
named, said some money was already in the budget, for prison
construction, and some would be shifted from other law enforcement
areas, but most would have to come from a cushion of
``discretionary funds'' built into the budget compromise worked out
by the White House and congressional leaders.
   Some of the president's proposals, such as the ban on clips more
than 15 rounds, require congressional legislation, while others
could be covered by administrative action. Most assault-style
weapons used by criminals are equipped with 20-round magazines, the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms says.
   Bush, in his proposals for making federal sentences for various
crimes tougher and surer, made no mention of changing the federal
furlough system, which allows some convicted felons, including drug
offenders, to go home on weekend passes. During the presidential
campaign, Bush repeatedly criticized the furlough program in
Massachussetts, the home state of his Democratic opponent, Gov.
Michael Dukakis.
   In remarks awaited with great anticipation by both gun owners
and gun-control advocates, Bush said he would make permanent his
ban on imports that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
says are not for sport.
   That requirement is already contained in federal law, but before
his announcement in March of a temporary ban, such guns had entered
the country by the thousands largely because of difficulty in
defining whether they were for sporting or other use. In March,
Bush ordered the agency to review and resolve the issue.
   As to why Bush made a distinction between imports and domestic
models with virtually the same firepower, the administration
official said only that imports can be dealt with under existing
law while it would require pushing new legislation through Congress
to restrict the others.
   Among provisions in the anti-crime package, Bush would:
   _Double the current five-year minimum sentence for using a
semiautomatic firearm in a crime. ``No probation, no parole,'' Bush
said.
   _Recommend the death penalty for people who commit a number of
federal offenses already on the books including murder for hire,
killings by federal prisoners serving life sentences, terrorist
murders of American citizens, and murders of hostages.
   The administration is also proposing changes to allow for
executions for such crimes as treason and espionage under
provisions now in disuse because statutes do not satisfy Supreme
Court guidelines.
   _Spend $1 billion for new prison construction; identify
government properties and facilities for conversion to jails and
prisons.
   _Authorize 825 new federal agents and staff in the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the U.S. Marshals Service and the
FBI. Bush said, ``Our police need more help. ... We're prepared to
match rhetoric with resources _ and call on our cities and states
to do the same.''
   _Amend the Armed Career Criminal statue to include juvenile
convictions when deciding whether someone is a habitual criminal
and thus subject to an enhanced sentence.
   _Expand the existing ban on firearm sales to people convicted of
certain violent crimes, to cover anyone convicted of violent
misdemeanor offenses.
   _Add 1,600 positions in the U.S. attorneys' office.

   A Chicago man was arrested and charged
Monday with making bomb threats against the elementary school where
a woman went on a shooting rampage a year ago, authorities said.
   Hubbard Woods Elementary School in this northern suburb was
evacuated May 9 after a threat was made by telephone, but no bomb
was found, Winnetka police Lt. William Gallagher said.
   Gallagher said more calls, believed to be from the same person,
were traced to a pay telephone at a coin laundry on Chicago's North
Side.
   Officers placed the pay telephone under surveillance and
arrested Ricky Bookie, 35, when school officials said the caller
was on the line again Monday, the lieutenant said.
   Bookie, described as developmentally disabled, was unable to
explain why he made the calls, but family members said he had
watched recent TV reports about the Laurie Dann case, Gallagher
said.
   Ms. Dann shot five students at Hubbard Woods on May 20, 1988,
killing one. She later injured a man before killing herself.
   Bookie was assigned a $100,000 personal recognizance bond and
was transferred to Swedish Covenant Hospital in Chicago for
psychiatric evaluation, said Winnetka Officer Edward Sehr.

   The executive committee of the PLO said
Monday a peace plan approved by the Israeli Cabinet was a farce
that ignored Palestinians' right to a independent homeland.
   The 15-member committee also called the plan flawed, saying it
did not include Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories,
addressed the plan to Jordan, and ignored the Palestine Liberation
Organization as the representative of the Palestinian people.
   ``The committee sees that this proposal does not concern the
Palestinian people because it fails to recognize their existence as
a nation,'' the committee said in a statement after a meeting at
their headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia.
   It said Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
would continue their 17-month-old uprising. The violence has killed
475 Palestinians and 21 Israelis.
   The Arabic-language statement was sent to The Associated Press
in Nicosia. The committee is lead by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and
includes representatives from various Palestinian groups.
   Israel's Cabinet on Sunday voted 20-6 to approve Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's election plan for the occupied lands.
   The plan rejected negotiations with the PLO and sidestepped
controversial points such as foreign supervision of the elections,
participation of 140,000 Arabs in east Jerusalem and a timetable
for the balloting.
   Israel has been under world pressure to adopt a peace plane
since the PLO decided last November to renounce terrorism and
recognize Israel's right to exist.
   The PLO statement said Shamir's plan did not take into account
all the international resolutions, including U.N. Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338, calling for withdrawal of Israeli forces
from Arab lands occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   ``In a further challenge of Arab and international will, the
Israeli government addressed this perfidious proposal to the
Jordanian government, which had formally disengaged itself from the
occupied West Bank and recognized the Palestinian state,'' the
statement said.
   It said world opinion supported the idea that the Palestinian
people were entitled to self-determination and the best framework
for negotiating this goal is an international Middle East peace
conference.
   ``The proposal by the Israeli government exposes the essence of
the call for elections as being no more than a farce designed to
deceive world opinion and consolidate the occupation, accompanied
by an escalation of its iron-fist crackdown against the Palestinian
people and the intefadeh (uprising),'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Commercial fishermen headed to sea for
the start of the halibut season Monday, hoping to steer clear of
oil from the Exxon Valdez spill by following routes charted for
them by the Coast Guard.
   Federal investigators, meanwhile, gathered for hearings on the
cause of the March 24 disaster, and the first otters treated in
Valdez for injuries from the spill were released back into Prince
William Sound.
   The Coast Guard made surveillance flights for three days,
charting drifting oil for the fishing boats. ``Very few areas where
halibut fishing takes place had any free floating oil and it looks
good,'' said Cmdr. Mike Donohoe.
   Bob Trumble, a biologist with the International Pacific Halibut
Commission in Seattle, said that Alaska has several thousand
vessels licensed for halibut, but many probably wouldn't be
participating on Monday, the first of possibly four 24-hour halibut
periods, because they are taking part in the oil cleanup.
   The number of halibut fishing periods set by the commission
depends on how many fish are caught; the yearly quota could be
caught in just three openers.
   Trumble said that along with steering vesels clear of oil, state
and federal inspectors will check the catch to ensure no tainted
fish wind up on anyone's table.
   ``Everyone is making a major commitment to make sure all the
fish that are harvested are safe and pure,'' he said.
   The pollution led the state to cancel or postpone herring, black
cod and shrimp harvests in the sound, and it closed some herring
fishing grounds.
   The halibut season was at risk until May 9, when federal
officials decided to go ahead with Monday's 24-hour ``opener''
after determining that most of the Gulf of Alaska halibut grounds
were not affected by the spill.
   More than 60 million pounds of the large, flounder-like fish
were caught off Alaska last year and sold for $74.5 million.
   Members of the National Transportation Safety Board scheduled
five days of hearings beginning Tuesday in Anchorage to investigate
the cause of the spill.
   The tanker strayed from shipping lanes on a clear, calm night
and tore its hull on a charted reef in Prince William Sound, 25
miles from the southern end of the Alaskan pipeline at Valdez. The
ship bled 10.9 million gallons of oil, fouling hundreds of miles of
shoreline.
   More than two dozen witnesses were expected to testify,
including Coast Guard personnel, crew members from the Exxon Valdez
and Exxon executives.
   The skipper of the Exxon Valdez, Joseph Hazelwood, declined to
testify but offered information in writing to the board.
   Hazelwood has been charged with operating a vessel while drunk
and goes on trial June 20. He is free on $50,000 bail. He faces two
years, three months in jail and $11,000 in fines if convicted.
   The NTSB panel of inquiry includes representatives of the four
parties with a direct interest in the proceedings _ the state of
Alaska, Exxon, the Coast Guard and Alyeska, which operates the
800-mile Alaskan pipeline.
   NTSB spokeswoman Drucella Andersen said the board's report will
take up to a year. ``We hope to determine the probable cause and
make some safety recommendations,'' she said.
   In Prince William Sound, seven otters that had been taken to the
otter rehabilitation center in Valdez for oil-related injuries were
released Monday near Simpson Bay, northwest of Cordova, the Coast
Guard said.
   Center director Randall Davis said ``the otters' fur once again
will fully insulate the animals.''
   The otters were tagged with radio transmitters to allow federal
biologists to track their movement.

   Movie producer Robert Evans on Monday won the
right to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination during a preliminary hearing on a slaying linked
to his film ``The Cotton Club.''
   A witness implicated four defendants in the 1983 slaying of New
York theatrical producer Roy Radin, but never mentioned Evans' name.
   Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay had threatened to jail Evans, who
is not charged in the killing, for contempt for refusing to testify
about it.
   But McKay on Monday said she was swayed by arguments from Evans'
attorney, who cited a report in Saturday's Los Angeles Times that
Evans has been linked by two potential witnesses to the Radin
killing.
   ``The court finds that Mr. Evans may properly invoke his right
against self-incrimination,'' she said.
   The judge added an exception: Evans must answer whether he knew
Radin, a question posed by the prosecutor last Friday.
   She said answering that question could not incriminate Evans.
However, his lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, said his client should not
answer even that question.
   McKay sent the issue to supervising Municipal Court Judge David
Horwitz, who after meeting with Evans and his lawyers in chambers
ruled the producer didn't have to answer that question, either.
   The preliminary hearing is to determine if there is enough
evidence for the defendants to stand trial.
   The first witness was Carl Pizak, who worked as a security guard
for defendant Karen Delayne ``Laynie'' Greenberger and for former
Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, who is not a defendant.
   Pizak testified that all four defendants were involved in
Radin's killing and that it was related to a theft of cocaine and
money. He said he helped the defendants dispose of the murder
weapons.
   Evans, producer of such hits as ``The Godfather,'' ``Love
Story'' and ``Chinatown,'' was in the midst of negotiations with
Radin to raise money for ``The Cotton Club'' when Radin disappeared
and was found slain.
   The two had been introduced by Greenberger.
   No charges were filed until last year, when a former
brother-in-law of Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt came
forward with information.
   The case has become Hollywood's most watched real-life drama as
new developments provided links to Flynt's publishing empire and
the underworld of Colombian cocaine dealers.
   Greenberger is reputed to be a cocaine dealer with ties to the
network of imprisoned Colombian drug kingpin Carlos Lehder.
   Her co-defendants are former Flynt bodyguards Alex Lamota Marti,
William Molony Mentzer and Robert Ulmer Lowe. Lowe is fighting
extradition in Maryland.

   Student leaders, speaking to cheering crowds in
Beijing's central square, urged visiting Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev on Tuesday to take their case for a democratic China
to Chinese leaders.
   More than 3,000 students, many weak from a three-day hunger
strike, and an estimated 150,000 supporters and onlookers continued
their occupation of Tiananmen Square, the symbolic political center
of China.
   ``As a great political reformer, we urge Mikhail Gorbachev to
talk to the government on our behalf for humanitarian reasons,''
Wang Dan, a student leader from Beijing University, told a news
conference.
   Gorbachev arrived Monday for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in
30 years. He met China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, Tuesday in
the Great Hall of the People, the national seat of government next
to Tiananmen square.
   He was to lay a wreath at a monument on the square before
meeting Deng, but the event was canceled because of the massive
student presence.
   A planned welcoming ceremony Monday at the Great Hall was held
instead at the airport and Gorbachev's motorcade was rerouted.
   Asked if the students were hurting China's world image by
disrupting the summit schedule, Wang replied, ``If we influence
Gorbachev's visit to China, this is not our responsibility, it's
the government's problem. Our conditions are clear but the
government has been silent.''
   The students have demanded that the government recognize the
independent student unions that have led the monthlong campaign for
democratic reforms. They are also seeking a dialogue on such issues
as press freedom and official corruption.
   The government has held talks with selected students, but has
refused to recognize the activist organizations.
   While Gorbachev was the honored guest at an official banquet
inside the Great Hall Monday evening, thousands of protesters
rushed to the steps of the hall and chanted ``Dialogue, dialogue!''
   In the early morning hours, bands of youths stormed the steps of
the hall and engaged in shoving matches with troops.
   The youths identified themselves as ``workers'' but would not
say from which factory. Student leaders claimed they were
undercover police sent to disrupt the protest.
   One woman from Beijing University, Chai Ling, said at the news
conference, ``If we have to die, we will die at the front. I am
ready to sacrifice my life for democracy.'' She fainted on the
steps of the Great Hall and was carried away.
   Student leaders said five representatives went to Communist
Party headquarters at Zhongnanhai, near the square, early Tuesday
to ask to meet Chinese leaders. They said officials and soldiers
turned them back at the gate.
   Student leaders said 234 hunger strikers had been hospitalized
from dehydration, sunstroke or exposure since the fast began
Saturday.
   The students said they had collected $13,500 from sympathetic
onlookers since the latest protest began to buy medicine, hats and
drinks and set up a printing press on the square.
   On Tuesday, student groups continued to file into the square,
hundreds in each group, to support the strikers.
   Students and workers backing the hunger strikers marched
throughout the square on Monday, their red, white and blue banners
for democracy flapping in Beijing's dusty wind. Thousands of
intellectuals joined the protest.
   Government officials held talks with officially approved student
representatives Monday but protesters rejected the discussion as a
sham.
   Spread out around the Monument to Revolutionary Heroes, hunger
strikers sat, lay or sprawled in the middle of the square, eyes
hollow from lack of sleep and food.
   ``We have been here since Saturday and will stay as long as it
takes,'' said one Beijing University graduate student, his head
covered with a wet rag to protect him from the midday heat. ``I am
dizzy, tired and hungry but my problems are small compared to my
country.''
   Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang appealed to the students
Monday to protect China's ``image and dignity.'' Early Monday he
was seen on the roof of the Great Hall, scanning the growing crowd
with binoculars.
   Throughout Monday, hundreds of police moved into public
buildings around the square, but police presence on the square was
scant.

<TEXT>
   Six European countries have agreed to
provide a total of $50 million in economic aid to Nicaragua,
according to President Daniel Ortega.
   ``The money will be used to keep the economy from collapsing and
to help workers and producers,'' Ortega said Sunday on his return
from a three-week trip to Western Europe
   Ortega's left-wing Sandinista government has said Nicaragua
needs $250 million to support an emergency economic program to
reduce inflation.
   Ortega said Norway, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Italy and Finland
agreed to provide funds, but he did not give a breakdown for the
amount promised by each country or say when or in in what form the
funds would be delivered.
   He also visited France, Belgium, Norway, Greece, England, West
Germany and Ireland.
   Under an austerity program imposed in January, the government
has devalued the cordoba currency 15 times, fired thousands of
public employees and reduced spending, especially in the defense,
interior and health departments.
   Inflation, estimated at 20,000 percent for 1988, has been slowed
to a monthly rate of about 12 percent, according to the government.

<HEAD>Gays, Kinison Fans Clash Before Comedian's Performance</HEAD>

   A performance by comedian Sam Kinison
provoked a confrontation between fans and a group of gay and AIDS
activists, who denounced the performer's comments about women,
homosexuals and other minorities.
   About 200 protesters picketed for an hour outside a University
of Minnesota auditorium and distributed leaflets and condoms to
Kinison fans before Sunday night's performaans made obscene gestures and
shouted epithets at
protesters, and set several of their leaflets ablaze. One picket
and a Kinison fan scuffled briefly before university police
separated them.
   Emily Whince.
   Some fting of St. Paul said Kinison ``perpetuates hatred
against homesexuals and women, and gives a bad name to humor. He
uses it as a tool of hatred.''
   Many of Kinison's jokes use graphic language to describe his
views of the sex practices of homosexuals, lesbians and
heterosexual women, and he ridicules the use of condoms.
   Members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT-UP,
accused Kinison of spreading misinformation about the disease.
   ``He creates a very dangerous situation,'' said Keith Gann, who
edits a local AIDS newsletter. ``He is telling heterosexual people
that they can go out and behave in dangerous ways.''
   Some fans said they see nothing wrong with the comedian's act.

when the currency started at 137.70 yen.
   Traders said the central bank intervened market during the
morning session, selling millions of dollars to support the yen.
   Takamasa Yamasaki, a dealer for Daiwa Bank, said investors
bought the dollar ``like a sponge absorbs water.
   ``Market players have trusted the dollar and kept buying it, but
more than half of today's dealings are speculative,'' he said.
   Yamasaki said the central bank sold some $500 million to push
the dollar down, without success.

   Members of the House and Senate must soon
disclose how much outside income they earned from speeches and
other activities that have fueled debate over a congressional pay
raise and created a preoccupation with ethics.
   On Friday senators and on May 22 members of the House of
Representatives will make public their financial disclosure forms,
which all high-level people in the government must file.
   Although the forms reveal such matters as what stocks the
members of Congress bought, sold and own and how much they got in
reimbursements when they went on the road to make a speech,
attention this year, as never before, is apt to focus on the fees
paid members of Congress for giving speeches.
   Common Cause, the public interest membership group which has
campaigned for tougher ethical standards, says it has counted 245
newspaper editorials demanding an end to these honoraria _ calling
the fees ``legalized bribery,'' ``legislative prostitution'' and
``lobbyists' payola.''

   A top House Democrat says an arrangement that
earned him $6,882 in four months through buying junk bonds with
other people's money ``wasn't worth the trouble'' in light of the
current focus on ethics.
   ``With the benefit of hindsight, I now regret having made this
transaction,'' Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said Sunday as he
released his lawyer's report on the bond purchase.
   As House majority whip, Coelho is the third-ranking Democrat and
chief vote-counter for House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who has
been charged by the House ethics committee with violating rules in
his personal financial dealings.
   Coelho, who could move up in the House leadership if Wright
falls, said Sunday he would be amending his 1986 financial
disclosure to include a previously unreported $50,000 loan that
financed half of a $100,000 investment in junk bonds in 1986.

   Israeli leaders are under growing pressure to
seek the release of convicted American spy Jonathan J. Pollard, but
are playing down the case for fear of disrupting relations with the
United States.
   Pollard, a 34-year-old American Jew, was sentenced to life in
prison in March 1987 for selling U.S. military secrets to Israel.
His wife, Anne Henderson-Pollard, is serving a five-year term for
helping him.
   Israeli leaders have disclaimed responsibility, saying Pollard
was run by a rogue intelligence operation in Israel's Defense
Ministry.
   Many Israelis feel their government must try to secure Pollard's
release. There are complaints that it betrayed Pollard, who was
turned away when he sought asylum at the Israeli Embassy in
Washington after his exposure.

   Norbert Rillieux and Jan Matzeliger helped
revolutionize American history with their inventions, but the two
men scarcely rate a footnote in the annals of Yankee ingenuity
simply because they were black.
   Historian Portia James is setting matters straight with an
ambitious new Smithsonian Institution exhibition that celebrates
the genius of America's unsung black inventors.
   The show, which opens Sunday, pays belated tribute to 40
inventors whose creations include a trouser-stretching device for
eliminating wrinkles, a machine for producing paper bags, a press
for baling cotton and a mechanical traffic signal patented in 1923.
   ``The exhibition says a lot about their urge to create, and how
important it was for blacks to feel they were part of the growth of
American technology,'' said Ms. James, the show's curator. ``It was
their assertion of black participation in the Yankee innovative
spirit.''

<HEAD>No More Mr. Bad Guy</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strains, stress and headaches over
disagreements among allies are nothing new in the Atlantic
alliance. But this time there's a difference _ no more Mr. Bad Guy
across the table.
   For 40 years, internal discord in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization always has yielded to common concern about the
perceived menace from Moscow.
   Now that perception has changed. Two generations of Soviet cold
warriors have given way to a masterful political salesman. And
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's wares are making it more difficult for the
Bush administration to sell its argument for modernizing NATO's
short-range nuclear missiles.
   As President Bush prepares for NATO's 40th anniversary summit at
the end of May, the missile dispute looms as a dominant issue. So
far, it defies compromise, with the United States and Great Britain
opposed to immediate negotiations and determined to modernize the
missiles, while the West German government of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl insists on talks now.
   Bush says he thinks the missile differences can be settled, that
a lot of it is just smoke, and that ``we'll have a smooth summit.''
   ``This alliance is not going to fall apart,'' the president
said. ``It is going to stay together and be strong, and we'll work
it out.'' Bush has tried personally, by telephone. Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have,
too.
   As Cheney observed, ``It's not the first time we've had
differences ... You've got 16 sovereign nations with different
viewpoints, different political situations at home.''
   But Gorbachev knows an opening when he sees one. When Baker met
him in Moscow last Thursday, the Soviet president upped his ante a
bit, saying he plans to cut about 500 weapons from the Warsaw Pact
arsenal. It's a token _ the Soviets are believed to have about
10,000 nuclear weapons, from bombs down to shells, in the European
balance. NATO has about 4,000 that can be used at short range.
   Baker called the surprise move a small step but a good one. He
also said that NATO has scrapped five times that many nuclear
weapons over the past decade.
   Nevertheless, the timing of Gorbachev's ante can only add to the
European pressure the administration is trying to withstand. By
definition, short-range missiles are the ones that go off in the
neighborhood, and to the Germans that means Germany, East or West.
There is wide public support for negotiations to get rid of the
missiles in West Germany, and that leaves Kohl little room to
maneuver on the issue.
   Bush will be in Brussels May 28-30 for a NATO summit followed
immediately by a visit to Bonn for separate conferences with Kohl.
The two men spent a half hour on the telephone on May 5, but
neither budged. Gorbachev is to visit Bonn June 12-15.
   By the numbers, the administration has a solid case, because the
Soviet Union has a lot more to give or barter away. ``We believe
the vast Soviet superiority and Warsaw pact conventional forces
must be reduced before we can discuss reductions in short range
nuclear missiles,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said in summation of the administration stand.
   But numbers aren't everything, and the net result is to cast the
United States as the intransigent party, the side that won't even
negotiate. That's an unfamiliar and uncomfortable posture.
   Twenty years ago, President Richard M. Nixon traveled to Europe
on much the same route Bush will take at the end of this month, and
with a similar mission. NATO was in crisis then, too. President
Charles De Gaulle had pulled France out of the military structure
of NATO.
   Nixon told the allies that he would be entering negotiations
with the Soviet Union on a wide array of issues, and he promised
``full and genuine consultation before and during those
negotiations.''
   That's almost the opposite of the problem facing Bush as he
heads for Rome, Brussels, Bonn and London.
   In an appraisal of U.S. foreign policy this year, Nixon said
he'd once been told that fear, not love, holds alliances together.
He said fear of the Soviet Union has waned, ``and what love may
exist between economic competitors in the West is a very weak glue
to hold an alliance together.''
   A top administration official summed up the difference another
way, in one word:
   Gorbachev.

   It became the catch-phrase of the television
season, Louise Mercer's voyeuristic inquiry of recently divorced
new singles group members: ``Any sex-u-al problems?''
   Louise's recurring laugh line on NBC's ``Dear John'' almost
didn't come with the now-trademark, raised-eyebrow English accent.
   ``In the beginning they didn't know if I should play it as
English or use an American accent,'' said Carr, who has done an
American accent on English television. ``The decision wasn't made
until just before I tested. It's better for me. You don't have that
added pressure of how to pronounce your words.''
   Louise's accent is one vestige of the roots of ``Dear John,''
which is based on a short-run English series.
   Carr plays the leader of a Queens, N.Y., community group that
serves the needs of newly single people, including John Lacey (Judd
Hirsch), a schoolteacher whose wife ran off with his best friend.
He soon befriends several members of the group, including Louise.
   ``Louise is inquisitive, independent, warm and loving,'' said
Carr. ``She really cares about these people. She loves the group.''
   More than Carr's accent was incorporated into the show. Because
she was pregnant, so was Louise. Carr and her husband, American
actor Mark Arnott (``The Return of the Secaucus Seven''), had a
son, Dashiel, in February.
   ``I wasn't pregnant when we did the pilot,'' said Carr. ``The
costuming was fabulous. It wasn't apparent until the end. I stayed
small until the eighth month, then I exploded. I just looked
buxomly and matronly. People just thought I was putting on a little
weight. It was so nice they kept me employed. I only missed three
shows. They wrote in my pregnancy and Louise has become a single
parent. We'll have more on that next season.''
   Woody Harrelson of ``Cheers'' made a guest appearance as the
baby's father.
   Carr had come to the United States from England with the New
York and Los Angeles production of Charles Dickens' ``Nicholas
Nickleby.''
   ``By the time we finished the play I'd been here a year,'' she
said. ``I played different roles, such as Fanny Squeelas, Miss
Snevelici and Peg Sliderskew. By the time we got to Los Angeles
there was a lot of interest in me.
   ``In that naive way I thought I was going to be a Hollywood star
in a minute. It doesn't work that way at all. It's very difficult.
I thought it would be easier if I met agents and casting people so
they would know me when they came to London. Then I met Mark in my
agent's office, and six months later we got married.''
   Carr made her film debut at the age of 8 in Gary Cooper's last
movie, ``The Naked Edge.''
   ``It's hard to remember much about it,'' she said. ``Gary Cooper
looked quite ill. My mother put me in a neat cardigan, but it got
torn because I had to look more poverty-stricken. They tore a hole
in it. It was a wonderful way to make extra cash. My family was
poor. I kept pestering them for dance classes. It was a way to pay
for my classes.''
   She made her professional stage debut at 15 in a touring
production of Agatha Christie's ``The Spider's Web.'' She
originated the role of Mary McGregor in the West End production of
``The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' and made her film debut in the
role.
   She played one of the maids in ``Upstairs, Downstairs,'' the
British production that became a big hit on PBS in the 1970s. She
played an American in a BBC production of a Noel Coward short
story, ``What Mad Pursuit.''
   ``Doing an American accent in London is one thing, but doing it
here is another thing,'' she said. ``I had a dialogue coach. I was
supposed to be from Iowa, but I think I sounded like I was from
Chicago. I was brought up in a Cockney area, and I had to have that
accent knocked out of me. My sister still talks Cockney. I wonder
what sort of accent my son will have.''

<TEXT>
   Against a backdrop of political turmoil,
Iran's leaders are grappling with the thorny question of who will
rule the Islamic republic after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The signs are that, because no one has the aging revolutionary
patriarch's charisma or religious authority, no one man will take
his place and that Iran will be led by a council of three to five
members.
   The leadership question was thrown open in April after Khomeini
forced his designated heir, Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, to
resign following his criticism of Iranian policies.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is the front-runner
in presidential elections later this year, is likely to be a
candidate for the collective leadership, which would embrace Iran's
various factions.
   Other possible candidates include Ayatollah Ali Meshkini,
radical chairman of the 83-member Assembly of Experts; Ayatollah
Ahmad Jannati, a leading member of the 13-man Council of Guardians;
Chief Justice Ayatollah Musavi Ardebili, a centrist, and Khomeini's
son, Ahmad, who is showing increasing signs of political ambitions
after years in his father's shadow.
   Khomeini, 88 and ailing, has named a 20-man committee of Iran's
leading political, clerical and legal figures to settle the
leadership question and to draft amendments to the December, 1979,
revolutionary constitution, a move that could have far-reaching
political consequences.
   He said the constitution contained ``imperfections and flaws.''
He did not specify them but warned that ``any delay'' in the
amendments ``will result in plagues and bitter consequences for the
country and the revolution.''
   The committee is expected to present its recommendations in
advance of the presidential elections to be held between July 22
and Aug. 22 before incumbent Ali Khamenei's second four-year term
runs out in September. He cannot run for a third term.
   The result of that poll will affect the future course of
Khomeini's decade-old Islamic revolution and the power of the
country's theocracy, which radicals fear is in danger from the
liberalization sought by more moderate leaders.
   This has fueled a radical resurgence in the wake of the Aug. 20
cease-fire in the war with Iraq that has triggered purges of
so-called ``liberals'' and the executions of hundreds of political
dissidents.
   The current swing toward the anti-Western radicals dates from
Feb. 14, when Khomeini issued his death sentence on the British
author Salman Rushdie on grounds that he blasphemed Islam in his
novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   But Khomeini in the past has thrown his weight behind one
faction or another every few months in a delicate balancing act
that prevents any group from becoming too powerful.
   Some analysts suspect Khomeini may already be swinging back
toward Rafsanjani's so-called pragmatists.
   One of the constitutional committee's tasks is to decide whether
to scrap or downgrade the post of prime minister and broaden the
executive powers of the presidency.
   Rafsanjani, the only declared candidate for the presidential
election so far, is supported by the hard-pressed middle class, the
powerful ``bazaaris,'' or merchant community, and some of the
conservative religious establishment.
   The populist speaker polled 1.3 million votes in last year's
parliamentary elections, the highest single tally in the ballot.
   Another possible entry in the presidential race is
Prosecutor-General Musavi Khoeiniha, a middle-ranking cleric who
led the militants who stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in
November, 1979.
   The incumbent Khamenei, who backs Rafsanjani, noted that the
leaders who drew up the constitution after Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi was ousted sought to ensure that ``power would be dispersed
and not concentrated, in view of their bitter experience of the
concentration of power under the former regime.''
   The radicals oppose centralizing power. But Ayatollah Abolqassem
Khazari, an influential figure, noted recently: ``Some powers
should be concentrated. ... If the legislative branch is vigilant
... there can be no move toward a dictatorship.''
   The radical revival torpedoed Rafsanjani's efforts to build
bridges with the West to end Iran's isolation and left him
politically exposed.
   But the speaker, who has survived earlier reverses, has in
recent weeks publicly taken a much more radical position,
protecting his flanks from hardline rivals led by Interior Minister
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   How long he will identify with the radicals is open to question.
He has changed positions many times, trimming his sails to the
prevailing political winds until he is able to reassert himself.

<TEXT>
   Hastings Kamuzu Banda, president of
Malawi, is a man enamoured of the finer things of life and much
taken with English ways.
   From under his homburg hat, he rules with a stern hand a land in
which the police and prison guards are unarmed and the U.S. Embassy
has no Marine security.
   Banda himself rides around in an open limousine without the
heavily armed bodyguards that accompany most other African leaders.
   ``You don't get the impression Banda expects to be shot,'' said
a British diplomat who has lived in Lilongwe, the capital, for two
years.
   Said to be in his 90s, Banda is a short, spry man with a
brooding face that rarely smiles.
   He rules as president-for-life over one of the world's poorest
nations, a country of 8 million people with an annual per capita
income below $150, among Africa's lowest.
   But Banda's salary is equivalent to $77,000 a year, about 70
times that of an unskilled Malawian worker.
   His official salary is but a fraction of his income, however. He
controls the country's biggest trading, investment and real estate
conglomerate, Press Holdings, a group of private companies that
account for 30 percent of all economic activity in Malawi.
   Banda has seven mansions spread around a country the size of
Pennsylvania. It costs the state the equivalent of $1.9 million a
year to run them.
   His favorite is a British baronial-style mansion on a hilltop
outside Blantyre, Malawi's commercial capital. It is known as
Sanjika and its huge banquet hall is adorned with Scottish
memorabilia collected by Banda when he worked as a medical doctor
in Edinburgh.
   Banda has referred to himself as ``a black Scotsman,'' but his
people know him as Ngwazi _ conqueror. The state-controlled media
routinely refer to him as ``our dynamic and far-sighted leader.''
   But Banda runs a one-party state and wields power as if it were
a monarchy. He is strongly anti-communist.
   No East bloc countries have been allowed to open embassies in
Malawi, a mountainous nation in southern Africa, nor are there
diplomats from radical Arab governments or liberation movements.
   But Israel and South Africa, whose diplomats are shunned in most
African countries, are represented.
   Banda's diplomatic, trade and aid ties with South Africa have
earned him the condemnation of many other African leaders.
   Banda is Victorian and it shows.
   Women, including Western tourists, are prohibited from wearing
slacks, and skirts must cover the knees. Men with long hair risk
being refused entry by immigration officials or they may be offered
a haircut at the airport.
   At his birthplace in central Malawi, Banda built the Kamuzu
Academy, where Greek and Latin are taught by British teachers and
some 350 black pupils, wearing boaters and blazers, live under a
spartan regime.
   The academy is known as the Eton of Africa. Although the
secondary education costs the equivalent of $6,000 a year, the
pupils pay the standard national fee, which amounts to about $100,
and Banda pays the rest.
   Banda himself was educated in the United States, studying at
Wilberforce Academy in Ohio and at Indiana and Chicago
universities. He is a scholar of classical literature and an elder
of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland.
   After living in the United States and Britain for 40 years,
Banda returned to the former British colony of Nyasaland in 1958.
He was arrested by colonial authorities in 1959 as the leader of
the territory's only black nationalist movement. He spent a year in
detention, but, following his release, led Nyasaland to
independence as Malawi on July 6, 1964.
   Banda has ruled ever since in an authoritarian style that has
brought charges of human rights violations from such international
organizations as Amnesty International but raised little internal
opposition.
   Malawi's economy rests on a shaky foundation of tobacco, tea,
sugar and peanut exports to Britain and the United States, with
agriculture accounting for 40 percent of the gross domestic
product, estimated at $788.5 million.
   Only 10 percent of Malawians live in towns _ some 56 percent are
seriously malnourished _ infant mortality, among Africa's highest,
is running at 153 per 1,000 births, and average life expectancy is
47 years, Africa's lowest.
   As if its own problems weren't enough, Malawi has taken in at
considerable cost 650,000 to 800,000 refugees from the civil war in
neighboring Mozambique.
   Still, some progress is being made.
   Malawi embarked on a program of economic reforms dictated by the
International Monetary Fund last year. In return, the IMF and World
Bank extended a $160 million credit for an import-liberalization
program that has put Malawian factories back in full production for
the first time in more than three years.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ As many a high school senior can tell you this
graduation season, getting admitted to a good college is a highly
competitive business. And increasingly each year the admissions
staffs at the nation's top schools are blitzed by bizarre stunts
produced by a generation brought up on TV glitz and puffery. But it
takes a heap of hype to hide a mediocre academic record.

   A robotic finger fashioned from clothespins beckoned to the
admissions staff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A
dozen black roses arrived from an applicant who was turned down.
   Yale once received a suit of chain-mail armor.
   ``Staring at me from across the room right now,'' reports Worth
David, dean of undergraduate admissions at Yale, ``is a pair of
shorts imprinted with the name of our director of transfer
admissions.''
   A Harvard hopeful put his best foot forward by writing his essay
with a pen held between two toes, promising in the words of campus
laureate Longfellow to ``leave footprints on the sands of time.''
   Another sent pictures of his 23 pairs of shoes with the caption,
``To understand a person, try walking a mile in his shoes.''
   Georgetown got a pair of lady's shoes, one down at the heel and
worn through in the sole, the other polished and lovingly mended by
a young cobbler who worked part time to finance his college dreams.
   ``We get bathing suits with the Vassar logo,'' reports Vassar
admissions director James Montoya, ``lots of T-shirts and last week
some tie-dyed underwear. The theme this year seems to be clothing,
perhaps reflecting the values of this generation.''
   What it definitely reflects is high school hype at its most
hopeful, kids brought up on TV glitz and puffery clamoring for
prime-time notice beneath a pile of admissions folders.
   Increasingly each year, the admissions staffs at nation's top
schools are blitzed by a variety of bizarre stunts: computer
printed portfolios, Time magazine mock-ups proclaiming the
applicant Man or Woman of the Year, and endless coils of videotape
showing the aspirant ice-dancing, building a sailboat, addressing
the local Rotary, performing a Vivaldi's concerto for
contra-bassoon.
   The admissions officers at several of the nation's top schools
all had hilarious, often pathetic, tales to tell of student
self-promotions. And almost all were up to the tops of their
wastepaper baskets with videotapes, which they agreed seldom made
any valid contribution to an application.
   All had the same doleful message: It takes a heap of hype to
offset a mediocre academic record.
   Also, there are subtle changes taking place or about to take
place in the admissions process.
   Some schools, such as Vassar and Tulane, are getting away from
the formal interview with an applicant.
   At a growing number of colleges, the well-rounded student is now
considered something of a square peg. As Vassar's Montoya points
out, ``We have shifted from attracting well-rounded students to
building a well-rounded class.''
   The challenge now is to put together a class melding students
with extraordinary talent from different backgrounds: a promising
violinist, a top athlete, a Shakespeare-spouting computer whiz, a
street-smart pool shark with a passion for pure math.
   And, alas, alumni clout is vanishing from the admissions scene.
Even if an applicant's surname can be envisioned on a new library,
the verdict often is ``Goodbye, Mr.Chips.''
   Often the admissions office mail brings food: fudge, fruitcakes,
date-nut bread, pecan cookies, chocolates decorated with Harvard's
``Veritas'' shield or Tulane's Green Wave.
   Georgetown received homemade bread from a student who promised
``not to loaf;'' a wedge of Wisconsin cheddar with the plea,
``Help, get me out of the land of cheese,'' and an artichoke from a
girl urging the committee to ``peel away the leaves of this
application and find the true heart of the matter.''
   Lois Conrad, Tulane's dean of admissions, was sent a boomerang,
painted in the school colors, asking for ``happy returns,'' and a
charming music box from which a tiny car emerged pulling a ribbon
inscribed ``Tulane Bound'' to the tune of ``Way Down Yonder in New
Orleans.''
   Vassar got a Morse Code message in a bottle which when decoded
was a cry of ``Help, I've been abandoned in a high school with an
incompetent guidance counselor.'' Another candidate taped $2 to her
application. ``Not enough to constitute a bribe,'' she explained,
``but enough for a cup of coffee to relax you when you sit down to
consider my case.''
   Some of the slicker public relations ploys betray the hand of an
over-anxious parent, the computer skills of a secretary or business
partner or the ``grab 'em by the lapels'' advice of the burgeoning
bookshelf of how-to guides professing admissions expertise.
   ``When you're in this business, it isn't extraordinary to get on
a daily basis all kinds of attention-craving devices,'' says
William Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid for
Harvard and Radcliffe, where some 14,000 apply for 1,600 places in
the freshman class. ``I do think some of these guidebooks have
misled students. Stunts and gimmicks can jeopardize an application,
disclosing a lack of judgment or hiding positive factors.''
   At Yale, where l2,000 applied for 1,200 openings, Worth David
complained of seeing ``a good deal more PR tricks than we'd like.
People out there writing books and acting as independent counselors
are encouraging kids to package and promote themselves.
   ``Some of this makes sense. If you hide your talents, how will
anyone know? But kids forget the most important part of any
application is the record of what courses you took in school, how
you did in them and what your teachers say about your performance.
This is a heck of a lot more important than what shoes you wear to
an interview or whether you remember to send a thank-you note.''
   Thank-you notes are big this year.
   ``All of a sudden we are flooded with them, '' David groans.
``The guidebooks say sit down and write a thank-you note to your
interviewer, and the kids, of course, want to touch all bases.''
   In this media-mesmerized age nothing beats home video for
colorizing the ego and making every applicant famous for 15 minutes.

   ``I've got a whole box of videos sitting right here,'' sighs
Conrad at Tulane, which was in the final stages of putting together
a freshman class of 1,425 from among 7200 applicants. She cited a
few titles: ``The Bridge Beyond.'' ``Yonkers In Review.'' ``Live
Interviews on Christmas.'' ``The Final Judgement.''
   ``Oops,'' she says, ``that last one has judgment spelled wrong,
which isn't going to help, but then videos rarely do. We don't have
the time or the facilities to give them the consideration the
effort deserves.''
   MIT, where 6,600 apply for 1,050 openings, also has been
inundated with videotapes. ``These can backfire by being a sort of
overkill,'' laments Michael Behnke, director of admissions. ``But
we try not to hold it against them. Some are poorly done. The most
common take the form of `A Tour of My Life.'
   ``You get this poor kid opening a door and saying, `Hi! This is
my room.
   ``Come on in and meet my computer. Here's my bookcase.' Then he
wanders around and introduces Mom and Dad and the dog. It's all
kind of silly and a little pathetic.''
   Georgetown, sifting through 11,000 folders to assemble a class
of 1,320, tries to discourage videotapes. ``They're bulky to store
and difficult for the committees of our five separate schools to
view and pass around,'' says Letitia Peterson, associate dean of
admissions.
   Vassar, where the fall class of 600 was chosen from a pool of
4,350, doesn't accept videocassettes at all.
   Before the video craze, Conrad says, ``Tulane used to get some
very elaborate portfolios and collages. Students would display
clippings of every bake sale they ever participated in and long
lists of awards and blue ribbons. The ones I always chuckle at are
perfect attendance certificates.''
   This year a young lady sent Georgetown a hollowed-out goose egg
after an Ivy League recruiter at her high school put thumb and
index finger together and intoned ``goose egg'' when asked about
the impression made by a well-rounded student. ``I'm the ultimate
goose egg,'' she confessed, but promised to focus her varied
interests in one direction if accepted.
   In rare cases, applicants fraudulently have claimed to be
handicapped or a member of a minority or from some exotic
background to gain preference.
   A Tulane aspirant tried ``tracing his family tree back to
Cherokee Indians.''
   Harvard's Fitzsimmons recalls a foreign student who applied for
six or seven years, always with a different ploy. ``One year he was
very poor, then he claimed to be the son of the prime minister and
next the son of an alumnus. He filled out his own teacher and
counselor reports, with very little effort to disguise his hand
writing, and one year used green ink for everything.''
   Lately a number of top colleges have been questioning the value
of interviewing each applicant.
   ``Our next faculty meeting on admissions will be looking at
exactly that question,'' says Vassar's Montoya. ``Not all students
shine in an interview. The feeling is that a half-hour does not
tell us as much as the four-year academic record or recommendations
from those who have seen the student in action.''
   Tulane has gotten away from the formal interview in favor of
group information sessions conducted by alumni across the country.
   But a personal appearance is paramount for admission to what is
undoubtedly the nation's choosiest freshman class: the drama
division at the New York's Juilliard School. Each year more than
800, sometimes as many as 1,000, audition for only 25 openings.
   Competition is spurred by the success of such recent graduates
as William Hurt, Elizabeth McGovern, Christopher Reeve, Stephanie
Zimbalist, Kevin Kline, who won an Oscar this year, and also by the
statistic that 80 percent of the alumni are actively working in
film or theater.
   At auditions held in February in Chicago, New Orleans, San
Francisco and at the Lincoln Center campus, each applicant presents
a two-minute classical and a two-minute contemporary monologue to a
panel of full-time professionals: actors, directors, voice coaches
and movement specialists.
   ``Shakespeare and the Greek dramatists are popular in the
classics,'' says auditions coordinator Barbara DeGast, ``and
anything from Chekhov and Shaw to Sam Shepherd is fair game for the
contemporary part. Many are self-written, and some fit singing and
dancing into the combined four minutes. We don't accept videos,
except in the rare case of a Swiss student who couldn't get to an
audition.''
   All of the admissions officers showed compassion, tolerance and
a gentle sense of humor about the youthful dreams rising from their
in-baskets, gimmicks and all.
   Sometimes a gimmick is ingenious enough to qualify as
``supplemental material'' or at least, as David concedes, ``it
brings a little amusement into a long day.''
   The robotic finger beckoning MIT's Behnke ``demonstrated skill
in carving and figuring out the dynamics _ it actually moved at the
joints without executing an obscene gesture.''
   Tulane was intrigued by ``a beautifully executed treasure map
that showed real knowledge of cartography and l7th century piracy''
and with an engineering applicant who ``turned a very complex math
equation into to a love story, an amusing soap opera about the
relationshiained rain forest, an ocean, fresh
and saltwater marshes, rolling plains and desert, a kind of
earthbound space colony.
   Next year, eight men and women will begin a two-year stay in
this tiny, self-sufficient paradise to test just how the world
outside works, and how mankind can avoid destroying its fragile and
interlocking ecosystems.
   Kathleen Dyhr, a 39-year-old spokeswoman for the project called
Biosphere II, is one of the 14 candidates. She says the chosen
eight probably will be single, probably four women and four men.
Marrieds can apply, but unless both are especially qualified, one
likely would be denied.
   The candidates already know each other well in their everyday
lives on the outside, so it is doubtful that romance will bloom
under glass. But if it does, it is presumed it will be discreet.
   There is overall a duty to mission, and the candidates will be
chosen for their dedication. There won't be any psychological
testing, since there is stress enough in this geonaut business as
it is.
   Although the interior design is still tentative, each
biospherian will have an individual apartment with a ground floor
and a mezzanine, small but private. Unlike the rest of the
biosphere, the walls of the habitat will not be transparent. Each
apartment will have its own kitchenette, although, because of a
need for food control, the main meal of the day will be centrally
prepared and served.
   There will be a recreation room, a small gym, laboratories,
offices and a library.
   If Dyhr is selected, she'll have to give up cigarettes. No open
flame in the biosphere. It burns up oxygen.
   To test the basic living quarters, Abigail Alling, a 29-year-old
biosphere worker, spent five days in March living in a test module
where she harvested her own food from her own garden, cooked her
own meals and monitored her tiny environment, a 15,000-cubic-foot
chamber smaller than a moving van. She said of her experience, ``It
is truly a paradise inside. It's like a tropical garden.''
   But five days is not two years. No one knows what stresses will
crop up.
   The project is organized on the same basis as a scientific
expedition, with which most applicants have had experience. There
will be a group leader, but there will also be family and outside
guidance available by telephone. In short, they will not be alone,
stranded in space. If professional conflicts cannot be adjudicated
on the inside, they will be from the outside.
   ``You're going to have problems wherever you have people,''
Dyher says. ``But if you have eight individuals who are really
interested in what they are doing, you're going to have the best
chance of everything working together.''
   Their days will be full. Besides running scientific experiments,
the volunteers will be completely on their own, raising their own
food on a 24,000-square-foot terraced farm, where they will reap
bananas, papayas, tomatoes, cucumbers, wheat, and corn. There will
be pygmy pigs, chickens and milk from pygmy goats, enough to
provide each of them a balanced daily diet of about 2,500 calories.
   There will be coffee bushes, enough for a couple of cups each
per week and grapevines, enough for a ceremonial glass of wine now
and again. Besides, there's always papaya or banana brandy.
   When the last of the eight steps through the door _ sometime
before September 1990 _ it will be closed for more than 700 days.
Not so much as a newspaper or quart of milk will cross the
threshhold of this solar-powered earthship. News, movies,
television will be piped in.
   But Biosphere II, which covers 2{ acres and has 5 million cubic
feet of space, has a larger purpose than mere survival. It may
provide the pattern for future space stations and become a
marketable biosphere for other purposes, from the protection of
endangered species to the education of ecologists, a laboratory for
how the planet works.
   It is being financed by Edward P. Bass, a wealthy Texas oil man
and supporter of several environmental organizations such as The
World Wildlife Fund. Bass is sinking $30 million into the project,
which is located on his 2,500-acre Sun Space Ranch in this corner
of Ariizona where the Santa Catalina Mountains roll down to the
Sonorran desert and Tucson to the southwest.
   It is no easy task, this latter-day genesis. Just take the
insects which they grow and breed in an insectarium on the ranch
grounds. Some 250 species will be chosen to do the myriad
minichores in Biosphere II. They have been collected from all over
Biosphere I, which is planet Earth.
   Bugs will pollinate the plants, break down dead plant material
so fungi and other processors can recycle it, and provide food for
the birds and fishes. A few butterflies are being added for
aesthetics.
   Cockroaches, termites, earthworms and millipedes are welcome
because they enhance the soil. Houseflies, however, need not apply.
They are useless.
   ``When the life sciences people mentioned termites, the
engineers started jumping up and down,'' says Project Director
Margaret Augustine. They were afraid the termites, which have been
known to digest concrete, would eat their way through the sealant
that keeps the glass dome airtight.
   That led to tests with the termites the scientists decided to
use, and the creation of ``a worst case termite scenario.'' They
created a little termite sandwich in the center of which was some
favorite termite food. The sealant was deemed safe when the
termites would not chew through to the inner prize.
   So much for termites. What about lights in the human quarters at
night? They screened off the human quarters against the bugs.

<HEAD>ORACLE, Ariz.: the bugs.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Even the scientists came to cross-purposes in designing this
little world. Botanists wanted wind for pollination. Entomologists
did not want their bugs sucked up by big fans. The people in the
middle were the engineers, constantly revising plans, compromising.
   It is the professional nature of engineers and architects to
keep the outside world out. Now suddenly they had to devise ways to
keep the wild world in. As for the scientists, they were used to
having the whole outdoors as a laboratory. Now they have to be
satisfied with a very confined indoors.
   Consider hummingbirds, great little pollinators. But a pair of
hummingbirds need the nectar of 3,200 flowers a day for energy.
Scientists had to be sure there would be that many in bloom every
day of the year.
   At the outset, no one thought what would happen to the airtight
bubble with the air heating up and expanding during the day. It
would explode the glass. So the engineers devised external,
inflatable lungs that would store the excess until it cooled for
return to the biosphere.
   With a closed water supply, engineers also had to devise
exterior tanks to cool the liquid. In short, this small world in
some cases is too small for its own good.
   Nevertheless it will be the same air and water year-round. The
oxygen is breathed in by humans and animals who breathe out carbon
dioxide which is breathed in by the plants and used in
photosynthesis which produces more oxygen.
   Biosphere II is built on a hill to take advantage of the natural
proclivity of water. A stream begins on an 85-foot mountain that
dominates the rain forest. It then flows through the plains and
grasslands of the savanna, down to the 25-foot deep ocean with its
coral reef and then to the salt and freshwater marshes, drying up
before it reaches the desert.
   The water-laden air then is drawn and climbs the mountain where
natural cooling and condensing coils bring it down as rain and dew
to feed the stream again.
   The desert required a compromise. There was no way to reduce the
humidity. So Dr. Tony Burgess of the University of Arizona
patterned the deserts after those of Baja California where the
cactus and other plants have learned to live with ocean fog.
   Perhaps the most difficult design was Dr. Walter Addey's for the
salt and freshwater marshes. He built prototypes, one in the
basement of the Smithsonian Institution where he is director of the
Marine Systems Laboratory, and another in a greenhouse of
Washington's Old Soldiers Home. The problem was the proximity of
the fresh and saltwater species. The result is a miniature Florida
Everglades.
   ``The marsh may have been one of the most fragile of the systems
because of the life that lives in the mud,'' explains Kathy Dyhr.
``But in the prototypes he found they had virtually no species
extinctions except for the mosquitoes, to which everyone raised a
cheer. But Walter said that's not so great because we need them for
the fish. So they put up signs that said don't swat the
mosquitoes.''
   In a world without chemicals, the biosphere settlers will rely
on ladybugs, lacewings, marigolds and crop rotation to control
pests. Human and animal waste and compost becomes fertilizer.
   ``The earth has its problems,'' says Carl Hodges of the
University of Arizona who designed the human habitat. ``We've got
acid rain problems, dirty air problems, and we've got carbon
dioxide increasing at an alarming rate. Right now we don't have a
research tool where we can control the global parameters, like CO2
and the quality of the atmosphere. I see the big payoff of
Biosphere II as learning how to do a better job of stewardship of
Biosphere I.''
   The rain forest and its towering mountain and stream are the
design of Dr. Ghillean Prance, director of the Kew Royal Botanical
Gardens of London in association with the New York Botanical
Garden. He patterned it after the dwindling rain forests of the
Amazon.
   Dr. Peter Warshall of the University of Arizona patterned the
savanna grasslands after those of South America, Australia and
Africa. Plants and animals from those areas create the grasslands
in Biosphere II.
   In all, some 3,800 species of plant and animal life are being
invited to the party, and as in the original Eden, snakes. Says
Dyhr, ``We may need a python in there, if we put in rodents which
help aerate the soil and carry seeds.'' There will be no large
predators, however. Not enough room. An ocelot needs two acres to
range for food. There might be some mouse deer to help eat the
grasses.
   Of almost as much interest as the individual biomes are the
ecotones or tension areas where one biome yields reluctantly to the
next. In these areas, where well-defined habitats change,
scientists hope to learn how desert encroaches on more productive
areas, what happens when fresh water turns brackish, what goes on
when climates change.
   The idea of a biosphere, a living creation of nature with its
own logic, its own rules, is not new. Probably the first to
consider Earth and its environment as a biosphere was a Soviet
scientist, V.I. Vernadsky, in 1926. The idea was further developed
by James Lovelock and Lynn Margolis, who postulated, after Darwin,
that the environment helps mediate species variation.
   In the beginning, or near it, they suggested that oxygen was
sparse and so most of the early creatures were anaerobic bacteria
that didn't need oxygen. But they gave off oxygen, and in the
process poisoned their own environment so they had to retreat into
the mud.
   Biosphere II may teach mankind enough so it does not suffer the
same fate.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ After two years of scientific barhopping, a
University of Minnesota anthropologist has discovered that
country-and-western music can be hazardous to one's sobriety. That
jazz tends to leave folks in their cups. That small dance floors,
dim lights and live bands all make people drink faster. When it
comes to boozing, Jim Schaefer's an expert. He once spent his
weekends drinking Jim Beam out of a toilet plunger.

   Jim Schaefer is taking all the fun out of
drinking. In fact, he's got it down to a science.
   ``Check out the bar: Is it linear? Rectangular?
Horseshoe-shaped?'' Schaefer zeroes in on the serving counter of
yet another Minneapolis watering hole. ``Do you have an opportunity
to be face-to-face? How do people clump when it's crowded? Let's
look at the lamps: how many foot-candles of light? Is it noisy? A
decibel-meter would be nice...''
   Welcome to the Wild Kingdom of barroom anthropology.
   There are 656 bars in the Twin Cities, and Jim Schaefer has
bellied up to a big share of them. Of course, he didn't do all that
barhopping for fun.
   Well, not entirely.
   As director of the University of Minnesota's Office of Alcohol
and Other Drug Abuse Prevention, the lanky anthropologist wanted to
find out how lights, music and other environmental cues influence
the way people drink.
   Two years and five dozen bars later, Schaefer has discovered
that country-and-western music can be hazardous to one's sobriety.
That jazz tends to leave folks in their cups. That small dance
floors, dim lights and live bands all make people drink faster.
   Turn up the volume, throw in lots of seats, hang some action
photos on the walls, and there you have it: Jim Schaefer's
prescription for hangovers by the dozen, aspirins by the score.
   But there's no use crying in your beer. Just take off that
neckerchief and put on a tie. Dress codes help people stay sober.
So do upscale settings. ``Drunks violate the decorum,'' Schaefer
says.
   Add a jukebox, but keep the volume low, so people can talk.
Clear lines of vision help too, as do frosted beer mugs, an equal
ratio of men and women, and for some reason, landscape paintings.
   ``She's Acting Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles).''
   ``I'm Gonna Hire a Wino to Decorate Our Home.''
   ``What Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me).''
   Country classics, all. But prior to hitting the honky-tonks,
Schaefer had always assumed that fast drinking and fast music went
hand-in-hand. ``The fact is, in moody, emotional settings, people
drink more,'' he says.
   ``Jazz is hot and melancholy. Country has very rich,
core-value-based lyrics. It reflects real-life dilemmas: `Your
Cheatin' Heart.' `Lucille.' `Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain.' We'd
hear these 20 or 30 times a night.''
   To gauge the effects of all that lyin' and cryin', graduate
students carried tape recorders into cowboy bars in Montana, where
Schaefer began his teaching career. The students staked out tables
near the jukebox. While Willie and Waylon wailed away in the
background, the young scientists tapped the table each time a
customer took a swig.
   At the University of Minnesota where Schaefer now works, he
corroborated his findings, teaming up with sociologist Richard
Sykes for the most comprehensive academic study of barroom behavior
ever done. For two years, students observed 4,500 people in 65
bars; along with drinking rates, they noted arrivals, departures,
prices and decor.
   The results: People slowed their drinking when the tempo reached
85 beats per minute. When it dipped below 60, they sped up.
   The moral: Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys!
At the least, make sure they have a safe ride home after those long
beery nights with the mechanical bulls.
   For their next study, Schaefer and Sykes will zero in on people
guzzling in groups. Schaefer also hopes to check out the connection
between drinking and gambling, and between drinking and games such
as billiards or darts.

   He's taken to carrying light meters in and out of Twin Cities
taverns, and his curiosity about ladies' night is growing. He's
also busy refining his theories on twang: The nature of
country-and-western lyrics is important, Schaefer thinks, but so
too is the tone of the tune.
   ``I've begun measuring individual songs, coding them in terms of
nasality,'' he says. ``Societies with a high degree of nasality
tend to have lots of tension and stress. In our society, nasality
is pretty much out _ except for country-and-western music. This
could be significant.''
   Call it ``Coming of Age in Missoula.''
   But if the setting seems frivolous, the research is not.
Identifying risks can lead to more effective campaigns against
alcohol abuse and drunk driving, Schaefer says. It also can help
owners run their bars more responsibly.
   ``Alcohol abuse cost the country $117 billion last year,
three-quarters of it due to lost productivity,'' Schaefer says.
``We're all at risk: from cirrhosis, hypertension, heart disease,
cancer, fetal alcohol syndrome.
   ``We need to talk about how to drink smart. We need to learn
that it's OK not to drink, and it's OK to put down intoxication.''
   Tough talk from a guy who once spent his weekends drinking Jim
Beam out of a toilet plunger.
   Schaefer grew up in Schenectady, N.Y., the son of parents who
didn't drink. He made up for that at the University of Montana,
where he enrolled as a forestry major at 18. The legal drinking age
was 21, but that didn't stop him from checking out every watering
hole in Missoula.
   On autumn Saturdays, he attended University of Montana football
games with other members of the Kams and Dregs, a school spirit
group in more ways than one.
   ``They didn't allow booze in the stadium, so we'd go there the
night before and bury bottles of Jim Beam. We'd start drinking at 5
a.m. the day of the game. We drank out of plungers. And we'd lead
cheers _ dirty cheers, mostly.''
   Rather than let school interfere with his social life, Schaefer
settled for C's. Then forest economics left him stymied, and the
dean suggested he pick up a couple of social service courses to
boost his average.
   Schaefer chose anthropology. In no time, he was hooked. He
changed his major and earned an undergraduate degree, then a
master's. Then he decided to go all the way.
   ``It got to be time for my dissertation, and I thought of two or
three scholarly ideas. But when I met with my professor to discuss
them, he asked me a question that stopped me in my tracks: `What do
you know a lot about?'''
   Schaefer thought long and hard. Then it hit him. ``Drinking,''
he said. ``I know a lot about drinking.''
   His dissertation examined the relationship between drinking and
family structure, political ideology, values and religious beliefs
in 57 societies. It earned him a Ph.D. and a teaching job. Clearly,
Jim Schaefer was on to something.
   Twenty years later, Schaefer limits himself to one or two
drinks. He still enjoys the bar scene. But that isn't to say it's
been one endless happy hour.
   To keep from blowing his cover, he's dressed up like a cowboy
and learned how to two-step. He's smuggled gallons of booze out of
bars by the strawful to compare free-poured with automatically
dispensed. He's eaten chicken wings by the flock and crudites by
the crate, while listening to such nasal classics as ``She Got the
Gold Mine, I Got the Shaft.''
   Dedicated scientist that he is, he's even been known to drink
the occasional beer.
   Now really, all things considered: Don't it make your brown eyes
blue?

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He called himself the Unicorn back when he was
at center stage in the activism of the '60s and '70s. Ten years ago
Ira Einhorn skipped bail while awaiting trial for the murder of his
girlfriend and has been at large ever since. But amid recent
reports that the elusive Unicorn has been sighted in Sweden, plus
the publication of new revelations about the case, investigators
have not given up the chase.

   Police removed a steamer trunk from the
apartment of Philadelphia's star flower child 10 years ago and the
world created by the Unicorn began to wither.
   The trunk contained the remains of Helen Maddux, a blonde former
cheerleader known as Holly, Ira Einhorn's lover.
   She had been missing for 18 months by the time private
investigators hired by her family in Tyler, Texas, pieced together
enough information to point an accusing finger at Einhorn, until
then a living symbol of non-violence with incredible personal charm
and a nimble intelligence.
   Today the Unicorn is a fugitive from justice and faces a murder
trial if he ever gets caught.
   Einhorn was a '60s hippie guru of drugs and free love who rode
the tide of peace and unity to acceptance as a corporate
guru-consultant in the '70s. People looked to Einhorn for guidance
as the New Age dawned. He became a Harvard fellow and an
environmental leader as he and the times matured, though he still
dressed as a campus radical did, right down to the ponytail.
   ``He was a very engaging person,'' recalls Thacher Longstreth,
former president of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and now a
city councilman. ``I have nothing but respect for what he was, or
seemed to be.''
   An investigative journalist who chronicled Einhorn's case in a
recent book said the Unicorn was both product and property of
Philadelphia. The city nurtured him and worshiped him. The City of
Brotherly Love was also his stage and Einhorn was the ringmaster,
wrote New York City's Steven Levy.
   Einhorn was a founder of the Free University at the University
of Pennsylvania in 1964, organizer of the city's first Be-In in
1967, first Smoke-In in 1969, Earth Day in 1970 and Sun Day in
1978. He was an expert in the paranormal and spoke at conclaves
around the world.
   But the battered and partially mummified body in the steamer
trunk, along with some new and startling revelations by Levy, led
investigators and finally even his close supporters to conclude
that there was a very dark side to the Unicorn.
   ``It's a shame,'' Longstreth says, because here was a man who
held in his power the magic of the mythical creature whose name he
used as his own. The Unicorn focused the attention of the nation on
himself, on the environment and on Philadelphia when he organized
the city's Earth Day observance.
   ``It was truly wonderful,'' Longstreth says, recalling the day
thousands gathered to honor the sanctity of Earth and mankind in
Philadelphia and in other cities. But the premiere event was in
Philadelphia, on Independence Mall near the Liberty Bell. The
Unicorn presided as the television cameras zoomed in to show him
kissing Sen. Edmund Muskie full on the mouth.
   Levy said the Unicorn was more than just a nickname. It was an
ideal for Einhorn.
   ``Since someone had pointed out how his name (Einhorn = One
Horn) relates to the mythical horse-like creature with a single
horn between the eyes, Ira had fancied himself as kin to that
mythical creature, representing purity, uniqueness, gentleness and
sexual power,'' Levy wrote.
   The Philadelphia district attorney's office and police think
he's still got some of the magic because he's still running free.
   ``Somehow, he's still able to get the confidence of some people,
especially women, it seems,'' says Terry Williamson, a spokesman
for the district attorney's office. ``But he's a brutal killer as
far as we're concerned.''
   Einhorn was arrested on March 28, 1979, and charged with the
murder of Miss Maddux. The arrest shared the headlines of another
big event that day, the worst nuclear accident ever at Three Mile
Island power plant in Middletown, Pa.
   He claimed innocence and said it was a CIA-KGB frame. He was
able to get the services of a top attorney of the time, Arlen
Specter, now a U.S. senator.
   But evidence of a frame didn't surface and in January of 1981,
while free on bail, the Unicorn skipped. His trial was to begin in
February or March.
   Einhorn grew up in Philadelphia's Jewish neighborhoods, attended
the University of Pennsylvania and was among the many caught up in
the activism of the Vietnam era. Levy grew up within a mile of
Einhorn, attended the same high school where Einhorn studied and
played football. There was a chance face-to-face meeting while Levy
was working on the underground newspaper known as the Drummer.
   Those memories prompted his decision to research and write ``The
Unicorn's Secret,'' which was published in October.

   ``I remembered well that Ira was the big presence in
Philadelphia,'' Levy says. ``He stood for non-violence and it
seemed unreal for him to be charged with murder.
   ``I didn't set out to prove guilt or innocence. I just wanted to
find out what the real story was.''
   There was the story everyone knew.
   Here was a man fluent in science, literature, and hippiedom who
had built a worldwide network of intellectuals from all walks. He
was the prophet of new concepts he found in books, articles and his
own brain that flowed around the world to those in his network.
Bell Telephone of Pennsylvania even paid the postage and listed him
as a company consultant.
   ``I'm a communicator,'' he told the Philadelphia Daily News in
1975. ``I dig up facts and data and convey them.''
   Longstreth says Einhorn had only two faults.
   One was body odor. Another was simply his own motion.
   ``He was erratic,'' Longstreth says. ``He pushed his bad ideas
as hard as he pushed his good ones.''
   Levy's digging uncovered another Einhorn who could hide things
from nearly anyone, even his network of intellects and supporters,
nearly to the end of his reign.
   His network was still somewhat intact when he fled, first to
Ireland because there was no extradition treaty with the United
States, according to law enforcement agencies.
   At some point he assumed the name Ben Moore.
   One of those who helped finance his exile was Barbara Bronfman,
ex-wife of an heir to the Seagram's fortune, Swedish authorities
told the Philadelphia Inquirer.
   Ms. Bronfman read Levy's book and decided to cooperate with the
Philadelphia district attorney.
   Williamson said he could not disclose how much cooperation there
might have been or the true extent of the investigation over the
years.
   ``I can say that he's definitely always been a high profile
fugitive for us,'' Williamson says.
   Interpol in December conveyed a tip to Swedish authorities that
Einhorn was in Stockholm. But Ms. Bronfman's boyfriend tipped off
Einhorn and authorities found only empty rooms, The Inquirer said.
   ``The book definitely turned the heat on and a few people have
also contacted us,'' Levy says.
   ``The Unicorn's Secret'' is about how the Unicorn met the former
cheerleader from Texas in 1972, by then a graduate of Bryn Mawr,
and how such a man could wind up as her murderer while fooling
those around him.
   Levy discovered a stormy relationship during which Miss Maddux
tried repeatedly to shed Einhorn's overpowering influence. Her own
insecurities kept pushing her back.
   Then, in September 1978, she dropped out of sight. Einhorn
claimed he knew nothing other than she had left the apartment to do
some shopping and never came back.
   At first, that seemed plausible and police considered Miss
Maddux a missing person who wanted to be missing. But Fred and
Elizabeth Maddux had not liked their daughter's companion and hired
a retired FBI agent to find out what happened. The retired agent
turned to other retired agents for help.
   Levy's book followed the case being built against Einhorn by the
private investigators, including reports by dwellers of the
apartment who told of a terrible smell. One man even remembered a
scream.
   Levy found that Einhorn had asked two women for help in
disposing of the trunk. He had told them it was full of ``Russian
papers'' he had to get rid of. He wanted to dump it in the
Schuylkill River. The trunk wouldn't fit in their car, Levy said.
   He also found two women who had been attached to Einhorn in the
past. One relationship ended when Einhorn strangled the woman,
nearly killing her. The other ended when Einhorn smashed a bottle
over her head.
   According to Levy, only one question remained:
   ``How could a smart guy like him deny that trunk in his
apartment?''
   Levy concluded it was a drug, Ketamine, which wouldn't cause
brutal behavior, but would allow Einhorn to disassociate himself
from it.
   Williamson said the effort to find Einhorn continues today,
heightened by the book and the December incident in Stockholm.
   The problem right now, he said, is what Einhorn looks like.
   Swedish authorities said he cut his now-graying hair and changed
his dress. They provided sketches from those who knew him. The
trouble, Williamson says, is that the Unicorn has once again
managed to work his magic.
   The sketches were all different.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ As America prepares to honor its war dead on
this Memorial Day, many veterans of the Vietnam War are on
humanitarian missions to help their former enemies. They are
finding that time can heal wounds, both physical and mental.

   Fourteen years after the end of the
Vietnam War, former foes came face to face for the first time at a
government workshop in Hanoi where crippled Vietnamese veterans try
to eke out a living.
   Nguyen Dinh Vinh, who still feels the pain of an American bullet
that ripped off the left side of his forehead, told a group of
American visitors how he spent a year in an underground field
hospital code-named ``K-23.'' The hospital, in what was then South
Vietnam, withstood American B-52 bomber strikes and searches by the
U.S. infantry.
   ``I'm glad we didn't find it,'' said Kevin Bowen of Boston, who
had fought on that same battlefield but was now on a humanitarian
mission to aid his former enemies.
   As America prepares to honor its nearly 60,000 men and women who
died in Vietnam, as well as the fallen of other wars, many veterans
such as Bowen no longer hold hatred toward the Vietnamese and are
actively working to help people such as Vinh.
   At age 38, Vinh's future is bleak. He still suffers bouts of
dizziness and headaches. He and his wife make only $6 a month
between them at the An Duong Veterans Workshop in Hanoi, barely
enough to support themselves and their two children, 5 and 10.
   But he, too, is no longer bitter toward the Americans.
   ``During the war we both suffered,'' Vinh says. ``Through the
news media, I'm aware there is frustration and suffering among
American veterans. I can relate to that. For the Vietnamese, we had
to defend the country and we had to fight. Neither one won the war.
It's something neither one of us wanted.''
   Vinh is among Vietnam's disabled veterans who strain an already
bankrupt economy whose unemployment rate is as high as 25 percent
in a country so poor it can't even afford wheelchairs for its war
victims or equipment as simple as sewing machines to keep them
working.
   Nguyen Dinh Lieu, head of the government's Invalid Veterans
Section, says the country is struggling to care for 2.5 million
Vietnamese war victims, including 1 million disabled veterans and
1.5 million paramilitary and civilians.
   An October 1987 report by a U.S. technical team that visited
Hanoi estimated that Vietnam was able to fit only 9,000 of an
estimated 60,000 amputees who needed artificial limbs and
rehabilitation. The report estimated the country needed 30,000
wheelchairs.
   Estimates put Communist Vietnam's military losses at 600,000 in
the war with the Americans. Vietnam also has 300,000 soldiers
missing in action, according to Nguyen Can, acting director of the
Vietnam Office for MIAs, although some American veterans who have
visited the country doubt the number of MIAs is that high.
   Many veterans with slight or moderate disabilities are sent back
to the countryside, to their villages, to work the farmlands from
whence they came. Some are sent to workshops set up by the
government, like An Duong, which produces nails, inner tubes and
sports clothes.
   Others go with their wives and children to live in disabled
veterans homes like those in Tay Ninh Province, 50 miles west of Ho
Chi Minh City, in the southern part of the country.
   In one 7{-acre compound, 300 former Viet Cong guerrillas and
their families are living in homes set aside by the government for
disabled veterans. Legless, paraplegic, blind or scarred by napalm,
men and women alike recently made their way to a meeting room to
greet visiting American veterans.

   There representing the Joiner Foundation were Bowen, co-director
of The William Joiner Center for the Study of War and Social
Consequences at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, and
Ralph Timperi, assistant commissioner of public health for the
state of Massachusetts.
   The foundation provides humanitarian aid to disabled Vietnamese
veterans and hospitals. The veterans in Tay Ninh have been trying
to open a small woodworking shop and Timperi and Bowen are trying
to get tools for them.
   ``I was here 20 years ago,'' Bowen told the veterans. ``We share
many things in common. Our center was founded in 1982 to help
American veterans who suffered physical injuries as well as
injuries in their minds and hearts.
   ``That's why we return today. Although there are few of us here,
I think we represent many more back home. Tay Ninh was known as
tough country. I know because I lost my best friend here. We can
learn to know each other better, to trust and respect each other.''
   ``We all wish we could change the past, but we cannot,'' Timperi
said. ``But what we can do is work together as friends and
brothers.''
   A Vietnamese veteran who lost an arm in the war replied that as
a soldier he had killed Americans. ``I'm very sad about that,'' he
said. ``But I'm glad we will be friends.''
   Like Tay Ninh, the An Duong Veterans Workshop in Hanoi in the
north is filled with men and women veterans who have lost arms and
legs, but is virtually empty of equipment and medicine. Its
buildings and equipment are old, diminishing its production
capacities as well as the earnings of its more than 100 veterans
who average about $2 a month, not enough to survive on.
   ``The government has to provide extra support in order to
guarantee a minimum level of subsistence,'' says Do Van Nghe,
director of An Duong. ``In this area and in the capital itself,
there are many, many more veterans who are without any kind of job.
Either their families or the government has to provide for their
support.''
   By law, the U.S. government cannot provide material assistance
to Vietnam because the countries have no diplomatic relations, but
it has pledged to help non-government charitable organizations and
individuals in getting humanitarian aid to the country. In return,
Vietnam is cooperating more fully with the United States in its
efforts to find and return the remains of Americans missing in
action.
   Much of the humanitarian aid is coming from American veterans.
   ``We have a tremendous bonding with these veterans,'' Timperi
says. ``There's a very strong sense of common experience. It's very
sad to see the injuries that they've suffered and the difficult
life they have now. The economy of this country is decimated.
There's a lack of every kind of imaginable supply and resource and
equipment.''
   Just as they had in Tay Ninh, Timperi and Bowen brought badly
needed medicine to An Duong to help control the headaches of the
veterans like Vinh with head injuries. They also plan to ship new
sewing machines to the workshop.
   ``We receive very little support from the government,'' An Duong
director Nghe told the Americans. ``Without support from groups
such as yours, our capabilities to generate jobs and products would
be very much limited.''
   ``It's important we know each other better so that other people
will know who it is that we came to work with,'' Bowen replied.
``The hands are extended on both sides.''
   As these former warriors who had bloodied each other embraced
and shook hands, Timperi pointed to his hip and told the wounded
Vinh, ``I was also shot.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When officials wanted to know what kind of
weather to expect during the cleanup of the Alaskan oil spill, they
turned to a weather archive in the mountains of North Carolina. The
National Climatic Data Center handles tens of thousands such
queries each year, from farmers, lawyers, sailors, filmmakers and
others.

   Perhaps it's fitting that the world's
largest repository of weather records is housed in a 1920s-vintage
indoor shopping mall that leaks during downpours.
   Accurate weather records dating back to 1890 _ some even to the
time of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock _ are available at the
National Climatic Data Center, which has dozens of cubbyhole
offices in the the historic building guarded by two terra-cotta
griffins.
   ``Every time it rains hard the roof leaks and we have to break
out the buckets,'' says Steve Doty, the center's project director.
   Despite the accomodations, the center, with a staff of 300,
turns out an impressive amount of weather information, answering
85,000 queries last year alone.
   ``We can't give you the weather forecast for next week but we
can give you a look back 100 years,'' Doty says. ``Our role is to
supply the historical perspective.''
   The center's long view at the world's climate can be vital when
it comes to such things as fighting world hunger, sending
astronauts into space or winning court cases.
   For example, when an Exxon tanker spilled 10 million barrels of
oil in March into Prince William Sound in Alaska, industry and
government experts called the center to learn what kind of weather
conditions could be expected during the cleanup.
   By coincidence, the center had just published a climatic atlas
of the area, which provided detailed information on temperatures,
wind speed and ocean currents.
   Bill Brower, who helped prepare the atlas, said the data showed
the 70-mph winds that hit the Valdez area at the time of the
accident were unusual for that time of year. The information was
beneficial as cleanup efforts were coordinated.
   ``What we offer is a lot of good hard science,'' Doty says. ``We
can tell you normals and extremes so you know what to expect.''
   While keeping weather records may seem like dull work, some of
the greatest minds in U.S. history have shown an interest in it.
   Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington Carver all
were amateur weather observers. Copies of their records can be
found at the center, which is part of the U.S. Commerce
Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   The tons of records stored in the center's basement are
testimony to generations of less-famous volunteer weather trackers.
   ``We've even got a copy of a diary with weather records from
Plymouth Rock,'' Doty says.
   Most of the bound records stored in what once was the mall's
underground parking deck come from places like Vicksburg, Miss.,
St. Joseph, Mo., or Bear Mountain, N.Y., since 1890.
   So if you've just got to know how many times it snowed in
Chicago on April 30 for the past 99 years, the folks at the NCDC
can help.
   The raw data comes from the military, the National Weather
Service, the Federal Aviation Administration and 8,000 volunteer
weather observers. Hourly weather observations pour in from around
the globe, much of them from 10,000 ships stationed in various
positions and from weather satellites orbiting Earth.
   Current records are stored on computer. But because of budget
constraints the center has been able to save on microfiche only a
fourth of the 200 million paper records.
   In 1951, the center was moved from New Orleans to Asheville in
the mountains of western North Carolina. The city had a pool of
workers skilled in key-punch machines, so the government bought the
Arcade Building and set up shop.
   At one time, the sprawling building that takes up an entire city
block was bulging at the seams with key-punch cards. Now its rooms
are stuffed with computers and microfiche readers.
   The center prints about 5,000 different publications on such
topics as hourly precipitation data by state, national storm data
and global climatic data. The publications go out to more than
50,000 individuals and businesses.
   Seven staff meteorologists answer thousands of telephone and
mail queries each month. Over the years, they have been asked some
peculiar questions, including:
   _A free-lance writer wanted to know what the weather was like
during the Oct. 30, 1938 radio broadcast of the ``The War of the
Worlds.''
   _Actress Carol Burnett called to find out whether thunderstorms
and hail hit the San Antonio area on April 26, 1933, the day she
was born.
   _A company planning to shoot a television commercial wanted to
know where in the United States they were likely to find snow on
the ground in November. They were instructed to shoot on location
in Stampede Pass, Wash., which averages 64 inches of snow each
November.
   _A Texas law firm requested wind speed and direction records for
a client who was planning to build a chicken coop. The lawyers
wanted to show that the odors from the coop would not be blown to
surrounding homes.
   _A chocolate candy company planning a summer publicity campaign
requested nighttime temperatures in several Midwestern towns to
help them pinpoint the best time to leave samples on doorsteps.
   One out of three requests come from attorneys trying to
reconstruct weather conditions in accident or criminal cases, says
Sam McCown, the center's supervisory meteorologist.
   The minimum charge for information was increased recently to
$12, while the average cost is about $40. Some complicated requests
can cost several thousand dollars.
   Last summer, the center set up a special office to handle
requests for drought-related information. Calls came in from all
over the country.
   Richard Heim, who was in charge of the drought office, said
records on file from the 1930s and the 1950s put last year's dry
weather into perspective.
   At the peak of the 1988 drought, about 26 percent of the country
was classified as experiencing extreme drought. On his computer,
Heim called up a map from 1934 which showed 45 percent of the
country was suffering from extreme drought.
   The weather records also help scientists explore such things as
the ``greenhouse effect,'' a warming of Earth's temperatures that
has been attributed to industrial growth.
   ``There are some scientists who believe the 1988 drought was
caused by the greenhouse effect,'' Heim says. ``We've had worse
droughts. If this one was caused by that, what caused the droughts
of the 1930s and 1950s?''

   Greg Evigan, who portrays a carefree artist
on NBC's ``My Two Dads,'' is an artist of a different sort in real
life. He's a singer and songwriter.
   Evigan co-wrote the theme song for the sitcom and sings it on
the air. He also wrote the music for a recent movie and has a
development agreement with RCA Records.
   As Joey Harris on ``My Two Dads,'' he designs practical art
objects, such as some of the furniture in the apartment he shares
with his old college chum, Michael Taylor (Paul Reiser), and their
``mutual'' daughter, Nicole (Staci Keanan).
   Unlike Joey, a bachelor who's fatherhood is unconfirmed, Evigan
is married and has three children. The child in the sandbox playing
Joey as a 3-year-old in the pilot for the series is his son, Jason.
   In his first series, ``A Year at the Top,'' Evigan played an
aspiring rock singer who's tempted to make a pact with the devil to
gain success. Before that, he was in the road company production of
``Jesus Christ, Superstar,'' and starred as Danny Zuko in
``Grease'' on Broadway and in Chicago.
   ``My Two Dads'' has been on-again, off-again for the past two
seasons. It made its debut in September 1987 and ran for the whole
season. Then it was off the air for the first half of this season.
It returned in January, was pulled to make room for spring tryout
series and is now back on the air.
   In the show, Evigan and Reiser play former college buddies and
romantic rivals who now lead radically different lifestyles. Evigan
plays an artist and Reiser is an uptight, upwardly mobile financial
adviser. They are drawn together by the arrival of Nicole after the
death of her mother. In her will, the mother says one or the other
is the father and she wants them to raise her daughter together.
   The show also stars Florence Stanley and Dick Butkus.
   ``I wasn't looking to do a situation comedy,'' Evigan says. ``I
thought I was going to do a dramatic show, but my agent said just
go in for the meeting. They told me Paul was doing it and I said,
great, I love his work. They said I could sing the theme song, but
they wouldn't guarantee I could write it.
   ``We did the pilot, which was called `Who's Dad?' I'd heard it
was a write-off and wasn't supposed to go on the air. They said the
network had plenty of shows. But apparently one of the other shows
didn't work out and we were on the air.''
   Evigan describes his character as a free spirit.
   ``He'd rather go by his instincts, whether it's right or
wrong,'' he says. ``He gets into a lot of trouble that way, and
sometimes he's right. That's the catalyst for the relationship with
Paul Reiser. The struggle is to see how we change. Maybe I learn
from him and maybe he learns from me. But each of us retains our
basic values.
   ``We see how Nicole reacts to it. That validates whether my
instincts are right or wrong. We're all learning from each other.
Each episode has a moral, which can be a little syrupy, but if you
play it from the heart it can be good.''
   Evigan's first series, ``A Year at the Top,'' went through a
long and convoluted development, between 1974 and 1977. When it
finally reached the air it lasted only five weeks.
   Paul Shaffer, who's now on NBC's ``Late Night With David
Letterman,'' was Evigan's musical partner in the fantasy comedy.
One version, called ``Hereafter,'' was televised by NBC in 1975.
The show later went to CBS.
   Between times with that show he also did 10 episodes of a
syndicated show called ``All That Glitters.'' That was a show in
which roles were reversed. Women ran the company and men were the
secretaries.
   ``I played a schoolteacher on trial for taking students out on
the front lawn to watch dogs mate,'' he says. ``I said it was
educational. I was defended by a woman lawyer. It was a big thing
then, but it's pretty tame now.''
   Evigan spent three years in the NBC series ``B.J. and the
Bear.'' It borrowed the trucker and pursuing sheriff of ``Smokey
and the Bandit'' _ and Evigan's sidekick chimpanzee, Bear, was a
clone of Clint Eastwood's companion in ``Every Which Way But
Loose.'' Later, Claude Akins, as the TV series sheriff, was spun
off into a series called ``Lobo.''
   Evigan's next series was ABC's ``Masquerade'' in 1983-84, which
asked us to believe that the CIA was so short of qualified agents
that it recruited ordinary people with special skills for
undercover work. He co-starred with Rod Taylor and Kirstie Alley.

   Each day Willy Russell would drive past the
Everyman Theater in Liverpool, England, and see a huge banner
proclaiming, ``March 19, Willy Russell's new play opens.''
   Out of such positive statements _ and rapidly approaching
deadlines _ new plays are born.
   ``I'd wake up in the middle of the night and think about having
to give back the money to the poor people who already had purchased
tickets,'' the playwright recalls now. ``It was then that this
woman, Shirley Valentine, sort of came onto the page.''
   Since then, she has become something of a cultural phenomenon.
The one-woman play was a success more than two years ago in
Liverpool, the battered British port city made famous by the
Beatles. It was an even bigger hit in London's West End where it
won the prestigious Laurence Olivier Award as best comedy of the
year.
   Since then, ``Shirley Valentine'' has played places like West
Germany, Australia, Israel, Scandinavia and now is thriving in New
York, where it was nominated for a Tony Award as best play of
Broadway's 1988-89 season.
   In New York, as in London, the play stars Pauline Collins as a
bored, lonely, middle-aged English housewife who leaves her husband
and grown children for an amorous adventure in Greece.
   At first, Russell was skeptical about writing a monologue.
   ``I probably have the same prejudice against the idea of
spending two hours with the same character as anybody else,'' he
says. ``I knew I couldn't write just a one-woman show but rather a
play that happens to have only one character present on stage. But
you can't convince an audience of that in advance. They'll know
that when they come out.''
   In productions around the world, the audience response has
followed the same pattern _ at first, skepticism and no great
advance sale, then terrific word-of-mouth from audiences and
box-office success.
   ``Shirley Valentine'' is the 42-year-old Russell's first
Broadway play. American audiences know an earlier work, ``Educating
Rita,'' more from its film version which starred Julie Walters and
Michael Caine than from its various regional theater and
off-Broadway productions.
   Russell followed a roundabout path to writing plays. Born in a
suburb of Liverpool to working-class parents, he dropped out of
school at 15 and seemed destined for factory work. His father
wanted him to become a printer, but Russell wanted to write _
songs, poetry, even a novel.
   ``My family was intensely theatrical, I now realize,'' he says.
``They told stories. They sang. They lived their lives through a
sort of oral theatricality. I think that's why I now write for the
stage and not the page.''
   His mother suggested he become a ladies' hairdresser, and he did.
   For six years, he set hair during the day and at night hung
around beat clubs like the Cavern and played the guitar.
   ``I was a terrible hairdresser but I couldn't do anything about
it,'' he says.
   Russell had his music, which by then was folk, and his
performing.
   ``You could write a song and sing it in a club that night,'' he
says. ``You could get a reaction to it. I learned the dynamic of
performance itself. That's why I have a great deal of sympathy for
actors _ because I performed. And because of that experience, I
finally got out of hairdressing.''
   Russell realized that if he became a teacher he could have time
off in the summer to write. In 1971, he went back to school and
when a drama department production of ``Peer Gynt'' fell through,
he offered to write a play.
   ``The second I began writing this play for the stage, I knew
that all the years of trying to write poetry, trying to write the
novel, I was struggling toward this particular moment,'' he says.
   Since those days, Russell has made a name for himself, not only
as the author of ``Educating Rita,'' about a young female
hairdresser who wants more out of life, but as the author of two
successful British musicals, ``John, Paul, George, Ringo...and
Bert'' and ``Blood Brothers.''
   ``Shirley Valentine'' originally was called ``Shirley Smith.''
   ``Such a poor name,'' muttered Russell's wife. The playwright
finally settled on ``Shirley Valentine,'' the name of a girl he
went to secondary school with and not anything like Russell's title
character. His character is not modeled on anyone he knows, Russell
says.
   Miss Collins, best known in the United States as Sarah, the
saucy maid in ``Upstairs, Downstairs,'' wasn't Russell's first
choice for the role. He always had associated the actress with
light, middle-class parts. It wasn't until he heard her being
interviewed on the radio that he heard vowel sounds that suggested
that her origins were not middle class. She was from the
Merseyside, the Liverpool area.
   ``Shirley Valentine'' transferred triumphantly from England to
the United States with very little changed for American audiences.
   ``It's very difficult, especially looking at Broadway from an
English point of view, because of the mythology of it; it seems
that it's the only sort of theatrical area in the world where the
audience is monumentally overprotected,'' Russell says. ``I wanted
to get through that without the play being Americanized. If we
presented the inds samples of Vidalia onions and
then conducts chemical tests that may someday enable consumers to
identify the strength of an onion.
   The gourmet onions have a reputation of being the sweetest,
mildest in the world, but when there are 50 to 60 Vidalias to slice
in a day, her lab fills with eye-burning fumes and a pungent odor.
   ``I have to wear a mask and goggles,'' Mrs. Hayes said.
``Otherwise, my eyes burn and my sinuses throb.''
   She and horticulturist Doyle Smittle are collecting information
on sugar and pungency levels in Vidalias.
   ``We're trying to develop a rapid, objective method of measuring
quality in onions,'' said Smittle. ``We'd like to have a technique
... simple enough that a grower or group of growers could measure
the quality in at least every field of onions they have.''
   This summer, food scientist Robert Shewfelt will convene a taste
panel at the Experiment Station in Griffin to sample some of the
same onions that have been tested.
   Smittle, who has been studying the compounds in onions since the
mid-1970s, hopes to establish a relationship between the chemical
composition of Vidalias and the onions preferred by the taste panel.
   Onions have virtually no odor until their tissue is damaged by
slicing. At that point, an enzyme triggers a chemical reaction that
produces ammonia and other substances that cause tears.
   Chemical tests give a good indication of an onion's pungency,
but they're too complicated and costly for routine use by growers,
said Smittle.
   Taste buds aren't as reliable as laboratory tests because humans
tend to forget how bad or good a sample was, he said. Members of
the taste panel will sample six onions a day, then they'll come
back a week or two later and evaluate the same onions.
   The horticulturist foresees use of an infrared device that would
scan onions in the packing sheds and determine their mildness.
Since sugars absorb infrared light, there may be a correlation
between taste and the amount of light that passes through onions,
he said.
   Smittle believes growers eventually will be able to place
stickers on each onion, with a picture of a thermometer showing the
degree of mildness. His tests have shown that onion mildness varies
from field to field and season to season.
   With a pungency rating, consumers could use the hotter onions in
dishes that require more flavor. The rating also would help
consumers adjust the thickness of slices to specific needs.
   Georgia's 260 registered growers and packers have turned the
Vidalia onion into a $30-million-a-year crop. Protected by state
law, onions bearing the Vidalia label have to be a yellow Granex
hybrid. The growing region encompasses 13 counties in southeastern
Georgia and parts of six other.
   Growers claim Vidalias are sweetest because of the variety and
the low-sulfur soil around Vidalia, a town of 10,000 residents
about 80 miles west of Savannah.

   Capt. Rob Hertberg jinks his F-16D
tactical fighter into a series of wrenching turns, levels off and
streaks over his target at 525 m.p.h.
   ``Boom! We got it,'' Hertberg, 29, tells his backseat passenger,
seconds after snapping the 15-ton U.S. Air Force fighter into a
steep, banking climb away from the target.
   Hertberg, under agreement with the Air Force, took an Associated
Press reporter on board for a look at the type of low-level
training mission that has become extremely controversial in West
Germany.
   As the jet rolls out of a hard 90-degree turn, Hertberg quickly
brings it down low over the village-flecked plains and bogs of
northern West Germany.
   Back in formation, Hertberg and his wingman, Capt. Keith Sage,

   ``I will use my name,'' His Grace
said. ``I will use it ruthlessly.''
   His name is Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, the sixth Duke of
Westminster and reputedly Britain's richest man, and he said he'll
lend it to a good cause.
   The 37-year-old aristocrat was standing on what he considered to
be a good cause _ the site of an industrial estate. He's doing his
bit to help the local development corporation attract American
investors.
   ``If you are given a lot, I think you should give a lot back,''
said the duke, who spends about one-third of his time supporting
150 charities.
   He says it springs from a sense of duty: ``We still have a lot
to do with those who have been left behind in the march toward
prosperity.''
   It's also a sort of insurance against those British radicals who
would regard the duke as a child of archaic privilege. In these
egalitarian times, it's important for aristocrats, from royalty
downward, to be seen working for the common good.
   But he is no apologist for the aristocracy.
   ``There is a class system wherever you go in the world. We just
have handles on our names to identify our pecking order better.''
   In the pecking order he is also the Marquess of Westminster,
Earl Grosvenor, Viscount Belgrave, Baron Grosvenor and 15th Baronet
of Eaton.
   The boyish, energetic duke is tall, medium-built, and for his
outing to Warrington he wore a conservative suit and the British
aristocracy's obligatory gold pinky ring. His basset-hound eyes are
very blue. His eyebrows meet at the bridge of his nose.
   Laughing in frequent short bursts, he is casual and friendly,
obviously well-practiced at putting the overawed at ease with
one-liners.
   He speaks with an updated version of the upper-class British
accent, laced with occasional Americanisms, like ``you guys.''
   The Grosvenor family fortune is estimated by London's Sunday
Times to be worth $5 billion, surpassed only by Queen Elizabeth
II's $8.7 billion.
   It owns 300 acres of London's elegant Mayfair and Belgravia
districts, including the plot on which the U.S. Embassy stands.
   Back in 1677, it was all cabbage patch and swamp, the dowry of
Mary Davies, the 12-year-old bride of Sir Thomas Grosvenor.
   The estate also owns pieces of Scotland, Vancouver in British
Columbia and Hawaii, a sheep station near Wagga Wagga, Australia,
and extensive property outside Chester in northwest England, where
stands the family home, Eaton Hall.
   ``It's not something I wake up every morning with and say, `How
wonderful to have all this money,''' the duke said. ``I am not
sitting there on hard cash and it's not going into cars and boats
as I see fit.''
   Does he ever feel guilty about being born so rich?
   ``No, never have done and never will do,'' he said.
   ``I am a curator of what my family does now and of what my
family have done in the past and I am a planner of what my family
will do in the future.
   ``I use my wealth in order to create. My wealth is a business
and it is a very substantial employer of people.''
   A major drawback, he said, is having ``too little time to see
one's family. I clearly resent that.'' But he added, ``It comes
with the territory.''
   Born in 1951, he was the second of three children. The other two
were girls.
   He was reared in Northern Ireland, where his father was a member
of Parliament and ran a silversmith's business. He has described
his childhood as idyllic, isolated and free.
   A series of accidents of birth and death brought the title to
his father in 1967, and at 16, young Grosvenor was suddenly heir to
one of the world's biggest fortunes.
   At exclusive Harrow school he was an undistinguished student,
and instead of college he roughed it as a cowboy on a British
Columbia ranch, learned farm management in New Zealand, and worked
for a real estate agent and a nature conservancy agency in Britain.
   When he was 21, his father became ill and Grosvenor began to
learn the complexities of the family business.
   In 1978, he married 19-year-old Natalia Phillips, or ``Tally,''
whose great-grandfather was Grand Duke Michael of Russia.
Fittingly, they met at a ball.
   At 27, on his father's death, Grosvenor succeeded to the title.
He has two daughters and no son, so the heir to the estate is his
cousin, the Earl of Wilton.
   ``Clearly my regret is that my father went when I was very
young,'' he says. ``I had to cocoon myself at a very early age.''
   He had dreamed of an army career, and found it hard to adjust to
his responsibilities.
   He reached a compromise. During the week he is the businessman
commuting to London by helicopter. On weekends, he dons camouflage
and joins maneuvers as a major in Britain's territorial army, or
volunteer reserve force.
   The duke has tried to modernize, restructure and expand the
estate, which builds and manages shopping centers, industrial sites
and office buildings. It has extensive property interests in the
United States.
   ``My goodness, we weren't quite on the quill pens when I took
over but we weren't far from it,'' he said.
   The duke says he has another ambition: not to be the Grosvenor
who loses the family fortune. He says he's happy to pay income tax,
but his accountants spend a lot of time figuring out how to avoid
inheritance taxes.
   Some of his tenants complain that his rents are exorbitant, and
he has been tagged ``Lord Greedy Guts.'' He is unapologetic.
   ``I operate on the simple principle of supply and demand. I am
not running a charity ... for some of the richest people in the
world,'' he said. ``Someone can go and live somewhere else if they
want to. I have a waiting list from here to Washington.''
   The duke describes himself as a liberal Whig and his aides
advise the uninitiated to address him as ``Your Grace.''
   The first duke was Hugh Lupus, a Master of the Horse, who was
awarded the title in 1874 for philanthropic works. The first
recorded Hugh Lupus was William the Conqueror's huntsman whose
contribution at the Battle of Hastings won him Chester as a gift.
   The duke's treasure-filled family home is a 12-bedroom modern
glass and white tile structure his father built in 1973 to replace
a Victorian palace that was demolished.
   In his spare time, Grosvenor enjoys hunting deer and grouse. He
likes scuba diving, too: ``It's rather peaceful at the bottom of
the sea.''
   It's less peaceful on the Warrington site. News cameras click,
questions are asked. Then the duke shakes a few hands, hops behind
the wheel of his dark blue Jaguar, and sweeps off.
   With two honks and a wave.

   Miss Piggy, glamorously attired in swimwear
and a broad-brimmed hat, is lounging around the hotel pool soaking
up the sun and the attention.
   The sun, high in the cloudless sky, is hot and Miss Piggy
retreats to a cabana. The hotel, like a pink fantasy surrounded by
palm trees, is reflected in the sparkling blue pool.
   Behind her, the crew rigs up a sun screen for her scenes by the
pool. Her makeup woman and wardrobe mistress await her summons.
   She pulls down her sunglasses, peers over them at a reporter and
says breathlessly, ``Please, no interviews.''
   Jim Henson, however, is willing to talk. After all, the NBC
series Miss Piggy is working on is called ``The Jim Henson Hour.''
   More than 30 years ago, Henson created ``The Muppets,'' which
has grown to include Miss Piggy, Henson's green alter ego Kermit
the Frog, Big Bird and Cookie Monster on ``Sesame Street'' and a
wide assortment of mostly lovable but sometimes gruesome creatures.
   ``The Jim Henson Hour'' is a magazine-style show that mixes
half-hour ``The Storyteller'' dramatic pieces, ``Miss Piggy's
Hollywood'' and Muppet creatures in various pieces, some of which
are enhanced by computer graphics.
   ``We had been doing `The Storyteller' and were working on a
high-tech version of a variety show and some specials when the idea
struck us of putting it all together,'' said Henson. ``We presented
it to NBC and they said OK. What it is, is two half-hour shows back
to back, but about every fourth episode we'll do an hour show.''
   One piece, called ``The Song of the Cloud Forest,'' is about an
endangered species of tree toad. The design is in the style of
South American primitive art with bright, intense colors. The
Muppet creatures are filmed against a blue ultimatte screen and the
animation-like background is generated electronically by a system
called Paintbox.
   ``Basically, everything we do involves creatures of some kind,''
said Henson. ``One show is called `Living With Dinosaurs,' which
was written by Anthony Minghella, who writes `The Storyteller.'
It's a contemporary story about a boy with a toy dinosaur that
comes to life. It's live action, but the dinosaur is a Muppet. My
son, Brian, manipulates the dinosaur. He also does the dog in `The
Storyteller.'
   ``We produce all of the shows. I have a whole separate unit in
England. They do `The Storyteller' and they're doing two of the
hour shows. They also made the creatures for `Lighthouse Island,' a
half-hour live-action show about an island with some very strange
people.''
   Henson said he wanted to do things that have never been done on
television before. ``I think we've always pushed puppetry to the
limits and now we're pushing new technologies to the limit,'' he
said. ``We're using the most sophisticated state-of-the-art
technology available. It's very exciting to mix puppets and
technology.''
   The Muppets made their first network appearance on ``The Jimmy
Dean Show'' in the early 1960s. Rowlf the talking dog carried on
frequent conversations with Dean. The first wide exposure of
various Muppet characters came on ``Sesame Street,'' whose 20th
anniversary was celebrated on ``The Jim Henson Hour'' in early May.
   ``The Muppet Show'' from 1976 to '81 ran in more than 100
countries and was seen by more than 235 million people. Kermit,
Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal and all the other creatures became
as famous as real celebrities. The show won three Emmys, a Peabody
and numerous other awards and honors. ``The Muppet Babies'' is an
animated Saturday morning series on CBS that has won four Emmys in
a row as best children's program and is also seen in 50 countries.
   Henson's creations inspired a series of movies, beginning with
``The Muppet Movie'' in 1979. ``The Witches,'' based on a Raold
Dahl children's story about a little boy who's turned into a mouse,
is due out later this year. His creature shop in London made the
characters for ``Dream Child'' and ``Teen-age Mutant Ninja
Turtles.''
   His production of ``Fraggle Rock,'' which ran for five years on
Home Box Office, will begin running in the Soviet Union in October.
   ``Puppetry is very advanced and very popular in Russia,'' Henson
said. ``Soviet television has a puppet pig called Krushe on every
afternoon.''
   Another series, ``Jim Henson's The Ghost of Faffner Hall,'' will
make its debut on HBO in the fall. It will feature a new set of
Muppets, including Fughetta Faffner, a ghost with a love of music
who haunts the Gothic mansion she built in the last century.

   ``The Accused'' (Paramount Home Video. VHS, priced for rental.
Beta, $29.95. Rated R)
   
   Rape is a difficult and sensitive subject to present for mass
consumption on film. Such movies as Sophia Loren's ``Two Women''
and Farrah Fawcett's ``Extremities,'' managed to evoke the violence
and rage of rape in a realistic and adult way.
   ``The Accused'' does the same, and more.
   Inspired by the gang rape on a pool table in a New Bedford,
Mass., bar, ``The Accused'' begins with a screaming, half-naked,
bruised young woman running from a tavern while a college student
calls the police to report that a woman is in trouble.
   The woman is Sarah Tobias, a foul-talking slutty waitress. Jodie
Foster won the Academy Award for her performance, and well deserved
it was. She is riveting and pure force. Her rage, her frustration
and her pain cut through the screen like a laser.
   As the assistant district attorney who accepts a plea bargain
for the rapists but later goes after the onlookers after locating a
seldom used law, Kelly McGillis is stunning.
   Jonathan Kaplan's direction is tight and absorbing. He builds
suspense from start to finish, and doesn't show the rape until the
very end. The scene is bound to make viewers uncomfortable, and
many will be angry at the howling idiots who encourage the attack.
But all will be riveted to the home screen.

   ``Pumpkinhead'' (MGM-UA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R.)
   
   ``Pumpkinhead'' is a little horror yarn centering on the dangers
of summoning up a demon to extract revenege, and finding out too
late what it means.
   The demon, Pumpkinhead, is dug up from a graveyard where folks
who have done nasty things are buried. Brought to life by a
backwoods witch, the demon shows his clear ancestry to the alien in
``Aliens,'' which won a special effects Oscar for Stan Winston, who
also directs this movie.
   Unfortunately, Pumpkinhead and the other scary special effects
just don't fare well on the small screen. Things that are supposed
to jump out just don't make it that far. No real heart-stoppers or
shriek-wrenchers here _ just a lot of gore as a half dozen young
adults are ripped apart, skewered and otherwise done in.
   The plot is OK. Three yuppie couples travel to the hill country
for a bit of rest and relaxation. While drinking beer, being
generally obnoxious and blazing around on dirt bikes, one manages
to run down and kill a nice little blond-haired, bespectacled kid.
The victim's dad carries the small body off to the mountain witch
to seek advice, resurrection and revenge.
   The photography is nice, and the acting adequate.

   ``Heart of Midnight'' (Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta $89.95. Rated R.)
   
   ``Heart of Midnight'' should carry a warning: Do not watch this
movie if you have good taste or might get upset over explicit
sexual activity on the screen.
   While there is little nudity or actual sex, enough is shown or
implied to make the story not one for the squeamish.
   Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as a young women who inherits a
closed nightclub from her doting uncle only to find out that the
establishment had been a sex club, and uncle was a sadist. The
place is haunted by bumps in the night and something that lives in
the walls carrying out mayhem.
   Some of the scenes are strong on sadism and there is a rather
long rape scene. There is also a tasteless exploitation of AIDS,
used as the cause of uncle's death.
   Peter Coyote helps Jennifer solve the mystery of the evil thing,
and why it is after her.
   In supporting roles are Frank Stallone, Brenda Vacarro and
Denise Dumont.

<HEAD>The Artists: The Killer Army of the Walkueres</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It'll be ``Apocalypse Now'' and not sweet
sisterhood from the Walkueres when the Berlin Opera brings Wagner's
four Ring operas to the Kennedy Center in June.
   ``For 100 years, nobody really knew how terrible the job is
these girls do,'' says Gotz Friedrich, who staged the Ring for the
company he has headed since 1981. ``It's a mixture of war and love
and necrophilia. It's a terrible situation. This is terrible
music.''
   The 58-year-old Friedrich says it took a modern movie to show
opera the real warlike content of the Ride of the Walkueres.
   ``The first time this music was really in the Ring context was
in `Apocalypse Now,' when the helicopters fly to drop attack troops
in Vietnam. The director (Francis Ford Coppola) understood what
this music means,'' he said.
   ``When I put the girls in black leather, I did it to show in
which kind of association we have to understand them today. They
are not lovely daughters of a god. They are wonderful, terrible,
awful girls _ the killer army.''
   The black leather bodices, Friedrich says, can be left
revealingly open or laced to conceal, depending on the inclination
of each Walkuere singer.
   Friedrich first staged a Ring at Covent Garden in 1974-76. He
started a Ring in Hamburg in 1979 but, because of other
circumstances, it wasn't done.
   ``I was really happy when I could do it in Berlin in 1984-86,
since you can not make too many different Rings in your life,'' he
said in a recent interview.
   The Berlin Opera's performances of its Ring in Japan in 1987
were the first ever there. It'll perform the cycle twice in
Washington at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
between June 2 and 18.
   The stage designed by Peter Sykora features a big tunnel, one
end facing the audience. Friedrich calls it a ``time tunnel.''
   The most important part of his Berlin conception, Friedrich
says, is the tunnel. ``The tunnel means for me the specific space
where time is suspended. What was old can be young. What is in the
future can be the past.
   ``When they come to the end of the Ring, they are on the
beginning again. When we start the Ring, we know we start from the
end. This is the philosophical idea behind all this.''
   A postcard was the germ of the tunnel idea, Friedrich said. ``A
friend sent me one from the new subway station in Washington, D.C.
Now it comes back to Washington.''
   The Ring, he said, is about power, money and love. Its
characters, and its viewers are trying to find solutions and a
better way for the next generation. ``But they do the same errors
again.
   ``In the opera we show what you could learn. Personally, I have
my doubts. Maybe every third generation has to repeat all the old
mistakes in different situations. The question Wagner puts is, if
love can save the world. What kind of love? How to save which
world? None of the questions is really answered. But in 100 years
the Ring stays very actual.''
   Opera staging is important, Friedrich believes. If the music
carried everything, composers wouldn't have been so intent on
staging. ``We know the stage is changed in 200 years. Therefore, it
is the duty and challenge for the stage to find a new dialogue with
the music because the composer wanted dialogue betweeen music and
stage.
   ``When the Ring was first completed and performed in Bayreuth in
1876, Wagner said in the next year he would change everything. He
saw, as soon as he saw it on stage, that what he wrote in his score
about the scenes was bad. But in his lifetime, it never came to a
new production. The tradition carried almost 80 years.
   ``Wagner is like a re-created genius now,'' said Friedrich. ``I
think we are only on our way to discovering him. I think it's very
good that we have as many different Ring interpretations as
possible.''
   Friedrich sometimes thinks listeners shouldn't understand every
word, keeping their minds and fantasies open for the big picture.
The Kennedy Center production will use English surtitles.
   Friedrich went straight from college to his first opera post, at
East Berlin's Komische Opera. And he proudly notes that he's one of
the last opera directors who actually started with opera and didn't
begin with theater.
   He saw his first Ring at the age of 13 in Weimar. ``I was
terribly bored. I hated this music. I didn't want to meet Wagner's
music until I was asked to make `Tannhauser' in Bayreuth in 1972.
After 1972, I did every year another Wagner. I'm happy that I came
late to Wagner so I knew better what is his great difference to
other opera composers,'' he said.
   ``Wagner started to make opera a new kind of scenic novel on
stage, with music. He anticipated the movie. This is absolutely
new. Also absolutely new from him is every character is torn, split
in two parts. They are brought together by music full of desire.
   ``We go to Washington, not in arrogance to show America how the
Ring is to be interpreted, no, no, no, no,'' he said. ``We say only
our Ring is one from many others. We hope it's one of the best
ones. We are thankful and proud to be invited to Kennedy Center on
the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Federal Republic of
Germany.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: An Early Retirement After Hits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LYNNE BERNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They are young and talented and plan to retire
by age 25.
   LeVert, the rhythm and blues pop trio of Marc Gordon and
brothers Gerald and Sean LeVert, has just released its third album,
``Just Coolin,''' a balanced collection of funk and melodic ballads
with snippets of dialogue interspersed throughout.
   ``We recorded those dialogue pieces spur of the moment, no
script. We were just acting silly and having fun,'' said Gerald
LeVert, a 22-year-old keyboardist and vocalist.
   But he takes a slightly different attitude towards most of the
music he has created. ``I get tired of hearing every album because
I wish I could do it differently,'' he said. ``You keep seeing how
you can do it better. ... I still have a lot to prove to the
industry.''
   His perfectionism, coupled with 24-year-old Marc's technical
expertise, has led to the development of their writing and
production team. ``Just Coolin''' showcases LeVert's complete
production responsibilities.
   ``It's not that I want to give up music by the time I'm 25, it's
just that I'd like complete control,'' Gerald LeVert said. ``The
hardest thing about the business is trusting people, and that's why
it's good to establish yourself as more than just an entertainer.''
   Gerald LeVert and Gordon have many projects under way, including
collaborations with James Ingram and Stephanie Mills, and managing
a new group, ``The Rude Boys.''
   The two also contributed to Miki Howard's duet with Gerald
LeVert, ``That's What Love Is,'' a Top 5 R&amp;B hit. They also helped
make Troop's ``Mamacita'' a success. The record was co-produced by
Gerald and Sean's father, Eddie LeVert, lead singer of the O'Jays.
Gerald LeVert and Gordon recently produced the latest O'Jays
record, ``Serious,'' which they said was their biggest challenge to
date.
   Ever since summers of being on the road with the O'Jays, Gerald
LeVert has thrived on the energy generated between the band and the
audience. He started writing songs with Gordon, who also plays
piano, when they met as teen-agers growing up in Ohio.
   ``My father would listen to the songs and would always say,
`Something's missing,''' Gerald LeVert recalled. ``Then we finally
started writing some good songs.
   ``We put out an album, `I Get Hot,' on an independent label
which sold 1,000 copies _ if that much. But we had a pretty big
record off that called, `I'm Still.' We did some shows and from
there we got the record deal from Atlantic.''
   In 1986, they released ``Bloodline.'' The first two singles from
this collection rocketed to the Top 10, with ``(Pop Pop Pop Pop)
Goes My Mind'' making it to No. 1 on the charts. In 1987, LeVert
came out with its second LP, ``The Big Throwdown,'' which yielded
three Top 10 singles, including the No. 1 ``Casonova,'' which
played on the soundtrack to the movies ``Fatal Beauty'' and ``The
Pick-Up Artist.''
   The group had its third No. 1 hit last year with ``Addicted to
You,'' which was featured in the movie ``Coming to America.''
   ``I think our romantic music is very sensuous, and our uptempo
stuff is something everyone can relate to _ it's funky,'' Gerald
LeVert said.
   ``I write songs thinking, `If we do this live, will it make them
groove or the girls scream?' But first I write for me. I'm very
critical. I don't think I'd write terrible, slop songs.''
   The title song on the new LP was originally written by Gerald
LeVert for the rapper Heavy D to perform.
   ``He took one look at what I wrote and did not like it. He wrote
another one in 10 minutes and that's the rap on the record,''
Gerald LeVert said.
   ``If my father doesn't like a song I've written, I'd think
twice. If I like it enough though, it's going to happen if I work
with it. It's only one person's opinion.''
   LeVert's energetic performances display the group's enthusiasm
for wanting to make the audience happy.
   ``That's the whole key: If you can laugh and have fun doing your
work, people see that and they feed off that,'' Gerald LeVert said.
``I love people singing along live and with the record. It's a
great high. The lyrics, harmonies and melodies are very important
for me, and it's important for people to be able to hum and whistle
your music.
   ``Usually I first come up with a concept, title or groove. I get
my ideas from TV, things I read, when I'm on the airplane _ from
anything. Then I give the idea to Marc and he does the music.''
   Gerald LeVert doesn't think LeVert will be changing its musical
formula, but he's toying with the idea of doing a solo album.
   ``I would want to do some social commentary, talk about
different things like family, the record industry, deceitful
women,'' he said with a big laugh.
   As far as the harmonious, close-knit group is concerned, Gerald
LeVert feels LeVert shows more signs of longevity than other groups
in the business.
   ``We have more finesse, more polish,'' he said. ``We're
vocalists. We don't need extra props. If we got a mike and a lamp,
we are going to be able to do what we do.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The Infinite Ways of Seeing Things</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 1950s, when Bobbie Ann Mason was growing
up in Mayfield, Ky., women had limited choices when they graduated
from high school. They were expected to marry, raise children and
remain in their hometown.
   Mason decided otherwise.
   ``I wanted to go off to college and amount to something,'' said
the author of the best-selling novel ``In Country'' and the
recently released ``Love Life'' (Harper &amp; Row, $17.95) a collection
of short stories.
   ``It was hard for me at the time to see the positive values of
having a family in the traditional way. If anybody stops to think
about it, it's a burden that prevents you from doing anything else.
That kind of thing stuck in my mind.''
   Instead of settling down, Mason attended journalism classes at
the University of Kentucky, where she developed a lasting interest
in literature. The softspoken author realized that writing was a
perfect way to express herself.
   ``I always say I'm a writer because I'd rather write than
talk,'' she said. ``It's hard to think of things on the spot but in
writing you can work it out. A writer has the luxury of time. When
you write you take the time to observe.'' She has focused her
attention on the people from the western part of Kentucky,
specifically the town of Paducah. Her characters face the problems
and opportunities of a changing world. Should they settle down or
further their education? Should they have children? Should they
move to another part of the country?
   ``People didn't have that many choices, but I think my
characters are discovering a lot more choices,'' she said. ``Times
have changed. Joe can move to South Carolina, Beverly and Jolene
can hop down to Memphis for a fun weekend. They can do these
things, and in a way it's bewildering, thinking about what it
means.''
   Mason's characters are people who are ready to make decisions.
In one short story, ``Marita,'' the title character is a college
student who becomes pregnant by ``one of two interchangeable
guys,'' someone whose name she can not recall. Marita decides not
to keep the baby and happily resumes her education.
   ``I think my characters are very hopeful that they're going to
get somewhere and find true love,'' Mason said. ``They're going to
find some kind of satisfaction in their home life.
   ``It's like the Bruce Springsteen song, `Everybody's got a
hungry heart.' Everybody tries to fill that hunger in various ways.
The wife and kid in Baltimore are not enough.''
   Mason writes sparely; some have called her style minimalist. She
weaves complex ideas around simple story lines. She cited Vladimir
Nabokov as one of her biggest influences, expressing admiration for
how he used surface images to show life's infinite reflections and
possibilities.
   She concluded the short story ``Coyotes'' with one of his
favorite metaphors, light shining through trees onto leaves.
   ``He (Nabokov) talks about dappled light,'' Mason explained.
``You think inside this dappled light, again and again and again,
and each time see things in a different way. It's an infinite
complexity of the way light and dark play together and create
shadows. There are just infinite ways of seeing things.''
   Superficially, Mason's characters are similar. They come from
the same part of the country, speak with the same accent and spend
their time watching television and shopping at the local mall. But
Mason is determined to give them dignity and individuality. In
``Piano Fingers,'' she writes of snowflakes falling, no two alike.
   ``There's individuality in the tiniest things. Nothing is really
like anything else. I want to communicate that everybody is a
person with a valid life even if they're not famous. There are
plenty of things people do that are absolutely heroic but they're
very quiet.''
   Like the author, Mason's characters are uncomfortable with
expressing themselves in words. In ``State Champions,'' she writes
of a teen-ager's inability to describe how she feels about the
death of a fellow student's younger sister:
   ``We weren't raised to say things that were heartfelt and
gracious. Country kids didn't learn manners. Manners were too
embarrassing. Learning not to run in the house was about the extent
of what we know about how to act. ...
   ``At Cuba School, there was one teacher who, for punishment,
made her students write `I love you' five hundred times on the
blackboard. `Love' was a dirty word. ... ''
   Mason contrasted this with her characters' dislike of pretense
and artifice.
   ``In most other things, country speech, which is really the
source of my style of writing, is very blunt and straightforward
and matter-of-fact and practical,'' the author said. ``But when it
comes to saying something direct about your inner feelings, it
seems embarrassing.''
   ``Love Life'' collects stories written from 1982 to 1988. The
author does not see any single concept linking her work, but wanted
to give the sense that her characters have grown through the years.
   ``I think that I'm trying to find out what happens next and get
the characters a little further along. I see that most of them are
growing towards an enlarged sense of possibility. I did think about
arranging the order of the stories. The stories towards the end are
about going beyond.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Jimmy C. Newman `Making History'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Ole Opry star Jimmy C. Newman
figures he'll be part of the record books this summer when he and
four other performers make the first Cajun music tour.
   Newman, Eddy Raven, Doug Kershaw, Rockin' Sidney and Queen Ida
will make a 20-city concert tour that will last until early fall.
   ``We will be making history,'' said the 61-year-old Newman, who
has been playing Cajun music on the Opry since 1956. ``This is the
first tour of its kind.
   ``I think we'll be opening doors in different parts of the
United States and probably in other countries before this is all
over. We'll be exciting people more and educating them more about
what Cajun music is.''
   Authentic Cajun food, prepared by Randol's Restaurant and Cajun
Dance Hall of Lafayette, La., also will be available at each
concert. A live album may be done during the tour and a TV special
about it is in the works.
   ``This definitely will mean a lot for our Cajun culture, and
there definitely will be a good, positive effect for each and every
act on the show,'' Newman said.
   Cajun music often features an accordian and fiddle and takes
folk tunes from the Bayou country and gives them a bouncy,
danceable beat. Many Cajun songs are sung in French because Cajuns
are descended from Acadian French immigrants.
   Probably the best known Cajun song is ``Jambalaya,'' which
starts out ``goodbye Joe, we gotta go....'' It has been made famous
by Brenda Lee, Hank Williams and others.
   ``It's a fun song that makes a fantastic finale,'' said Newman,
a native of Big Mamou, La. ``Everybody knows it and can sing along
and clap their hands and have a good time. It's such an exciting
song and very well written. It's a happy song.''
   The tour shapes up as one of the highlights of Newman's career,
which already spans almost 40 years.
   His 33 years on the Opry rank him as one of the veterans on the
live country music radio-TV show that's never missed a broadcast
since 1925. He's sung his Cajun songs such as ``Diggy Diggy Lo''
for millions, becoming the first Cajun performer to experience
mainstream success in Nashville.
   ``The Opry is home,'' he said in an interview. ``Whenever any
artist has been in the business for a long time, he's liable to be
lonely on the weekends without a home. When personal appearances
don't come in, it's nice to be on the Opry, have a home and get the
exposure it offers. And I have a lot of close friends there.''
   Since 1980, he has toured Europe every year with his five-piece
band, Cajun Country. He has written and arranged Cajun music and
has extensively studied Cajun culture. His wife of 41 years is
writing a Cajun cookbook.
   ``We have Cajun food nearly every day,'' Newman said.
   He had his own successful recording career in the 1950s with hit
records such as ``A Fallen Star.''
   During his years in Nashville, he's helped several aspiring
performers, including a young singer named Dolly Parton who has
said Newman helped her get a cherished spot on the Grand Ole Opry
some 25 years ago.
   Newman's recollection of the incident is foggy, but he
apparently gave up some of his time on the show in order to let her
perform. ``She encored and got a lot of attention,'' he said. ``It
gave her a lot of drive to go on with her career.''
   The Cajun tour should draw young and old, Newman said.
   ``I think we'll have a mixture of a lot of young people who like
the music, but we'll also have our older fans too who are very fond
of Cajun music and the individual acts,'' he said.
   ``They are going to get a big serving of Cajun music, the
biggest they'll ever get. We've got every phase of Cajun music
cornered for this show.
   ``Along with the music, the food is becoming well known too. It
arouses curiosity and mystique.''

background.

brain feels more and more relxed, more and more relaxed.''
   Robert A. Monroe, founder and executive director of The Monroe
Institute, is guiding his listener on a 30-minute journey to
dreamland via an audiocassette tape called the ``Catnapper.''
   The tape, one of a series of Monroe's ``Hemi-Sync'' recordings,
``recharges and aids recovery from lost sleep or jet lag; relieves
anxiety before exams, meetings and speaking...,'' according to a
brochure.
   The institute, tucked away in the Ragged Mountains between
Charlottesville and Lynchburg, also sells tapes it says can improve
concentration and memory, reduce stress, help break the smoking
habit, improve one's tennis or golf game or aid in recovery from
major illness or surgery.
   There are a number of companies that market audio-guidance
systems, said Leslie J. France, director of the institute's
professional division, but those ``don't use the specific,
carefully modulated frequences that we do.''
   Behind Monroe's voice, each tape has a different audio tone the
institute says manipulates brain waves to produce a desired
behavior. The tapes ``create an auditory environment in which
people can relax very profoundly and have extremely focused
attention,'' said Ms. France.
   Professionals ranging from a best-selling mystery writer to an
orthopedic surgeon swear by the tapes, but a leading biofeedback
and brain-wave authority says a person can achieve the same results
without using Hemi-Sync.
   ``The danger is that it shortchanges people,'' said Dr. Elmer E.
Green of the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kan. ``I have been
telling everybody to burn the tapes and start depending on
yourselves.''
   The Menninger Foundation, a psychiatric center that studies
human behavior, trains people ``to help themselves instead of
programming them,'' Green said. ``We want people to know power is
centered in themselves, not in a procedure.''
   Monroe, 73, said his interest in using sound to influence
behavior evolved from a long broadcasting career that included a
top post at Mutual Broadcasting System and ownership of radio
stations and a cable TV operation.
   Monroe found that certain audio patterns can lead the brain into
various states; he got a patent on the discovery in 1975. That
finding led to a system of ``binaural beats'' in which separate
signals are fed into each ear through stereo earphones to produce a
synchronization of the left and right hemispheres of the brain, a
focused and coherent state that Monroe called ``Hemi-Sync.''
   Brain synchronization happens naturally, but only for random,
brief periods, Monroe said.
   ``Rhythmic tones similar to what he has on the tapes have been
shown to produce a synchronizing effect on brain waves,'' said Dr.
Lester Fehmi, head of a behavioral clinic in Princeton, N.J. ``You
can produce a specific effect.''
   Still, a Hemi-Sync user has to be receptive to get the maximum
benefit, said F. Holmes Atwater, director of the institute's
brain-mapping project. ``A Monroe tape will not work unless you
want to cooperate with it. There's a lot of psychology involved,
but also physiological changes.''
   Best-selling mystery novelist Phyllis A. Whitney uses the
concentration tape to jump-start her imagination. ``When I have a
question that stumps me, I sit in a chair and turn on the tape. In
a startlingly few seconds the scene comes. I use it again and
again. It works. I get better ideas more quickly.''
   Dr. James M. Thomas Jr., a clinical psychologist in Ponca City,
Okla., has used Hemi-Sync tapes for two years as part of his work
with delinquent adolescents. ``It has reduced violent behavior by
one-half.''
   ``I was very skeptical about this entire thing,'' said Thomas.
``I have found it to be a very helpful clinical tool... I am
convinced there is really something to it and not just a placebo
effect.
   ``It's real, it's not mystical, but I sure don't know what's
happening.''
   Dr. Robert Roalfe, an anesthesiologist at Merritt Hospital in
Oakland, Calif., has been using Monroe's ``emergency series'' tapes
for three years to help reduce preoperative anxiety and
postoperative pain.
   ``I have seen a number of cases where patients are extremely
anxious before surgery and within five minutes they are asleep or
resting very comfortably. ``It probably reduces the amount of
anesthesia and definitely reduces the amount of postoperative
medication required,'' said Roalfe, who emphasized that he does not
use the tapes in lieu of anesthesia.
   ``I think we're on the verge of seeing a tremendous number of
cases in medicine where techniques that at the moment seem
borderline in acceptability will become very acceptable,'' he said.
   Dr. Peter W. Kozicky, an orthopedic surgeon at St. Luke's
Hospital in Bethlehem, Pa., uses the emergency series tapes in the
operating room during surgery and in the recovery room afterward.
The patients wear the earphones in surgery to permit ``positive
suggestions throughout surgery'' because Kozicky believes patients
``are aware of what's going on under anesthesia.''
   Through electroencephalograms and brain-mapping, Kozicky said he
has drawn a ``clinical correlation to what Hemi-Sync claims are. It
relaxes people.''
   Dr. Michael M. Dullnig, a Sacramento, Calif., psychiatrist, uses
the tapes as part of a program of holistic therapy to fight
depression among men infected with the AIDS virus and has found
they ``felt better, could sleep better.''
   The advantage of Hemi-Sync ``is there is no side effect to it.
Medications very often have side effects that can be
life-threatening,'' Dullnig said.
   Green believes Hemi-Sync reflects a society in which
self-reliance and self-discipline are obsolete. ``The trouble is if
people develop confidence in a procedure and not in themselves,
later on they will have to go to another procedure to correct
another problem,'' he said.
   He also wants to know if the tapes' effectiveness derives from
the tones or from Monroe's suggestions. ``I'm saying, OK, the tapes
work, but why?''

   The proud parents admire their newborn
child, smiling. A gentle breeze puffs the curtains and clowns smile
from the walls. It is a picture usually found in magazines and
conjured up by expectant parents.
   Reality usually hits in the middle of the night.
   Parents pace the room to quiet a crying child. The darkness
reflects their mood and the clowns on the wall now smirk. This is
the time parents realize how little they know about taking care of
their bundle of joy.
   Chances are the couple took classes on delivering the baby. When
those ended, it was a case of learning by mistake.
   Parents whose first children are born at William Beaumont
Hospital in this Detroit suburb have an option. Beaumont helps
first-time parents adjust to the experience with a program
involving mothers who volunteer as trainers.
   ``We've had very positive feedback, usually because of the
family setup nowadays,'' said Beth Frydlewicz, one of two
coordinators. ``It used to be that the mother, aunt, or someone
else from the family would come over and help out the new mom,''
but that is rarer these days, she said.
   Volunteers for the 9-year-old parenting program that began as a
Michigan State University research project go through intensive
training. In eight three-hour classes the volunteers learn about
listening to the new parents, feeding, sleeping and crying habits
of newborns and how to comfort them.
   The program is available to first-time parents only who either
deliver at Beaumont or whose pediatrician works out of the
hospital. Neither the Michigan nor American hospital associations
were aware of a similar program elsewhere.
   When a volunteer contacted Nelle Bird, 26, of St. Clair Shores,
``my husband and I decided we could use all the help we could get.''
   For Susan Larinto, 41, volunteer Ann Scheel ``was like my friend
and mother. It was like having June Cleaver helping me through.
   ``The baby was colicky, so I called and asked to join the
program. Ann came and looked at the baby and calmed me down. They
even sent a massage therapist to help the baby.''
   Not all moms need the same help, said Scheel, 57. ``Some moms
had very little skill and common sense. Others could have done
without the program and some moms are relieved to find someone
interested in them, not just the baby.''
   Volunteer Carol Eugenio, 34, a mother of three, knows ``how
difficult it is the first, second and third time.'' She also knows
the relationship is good for not only the new mother but the
volunteer as well. ``We let the moms know they are doing a good
job, we get thanks from the moms,'' she said. ``It's an ego boost.
It's nice to know you're helping someone else.''

   Wholesale prices climbed a moderate 0.4
percent in April despite a steep rise in gasoline costs, the
government said, cheering financial markets and providing hope that
inflation has stopped accelerating.
   Energy prices soared 7.2 percent, propelled by the steepest
one-month increase in gasoline prices in nearly 2{ years. Those
rises were largely offset, however, by a broad fall in food prices,
the first real breather since last year's drought, and by a
substantial decline in auto costs.
   The news rallied stock and bond markets Friday, where traders
said the report indicated the Federal Reserve Board's yearlong
campaign of fighting inflation with higher interest rates is

<TEXT>
   Avon Products Inc., the largest player in the
direct-selling field, is mulling what to do about a $2.1 billion
takeover offer from its younger and smaller rival Amway Corp.
   Avon says it currently has about 475,000 independent sales
representatives operating in the United States and another 1
million selling Avon cosmetics, toiletries and jewelry in foreign
markets.
   Avon employs about 30,000 people; its sales reps are independent
business people, mainly women who sell for Avon part time. Avon's
products are marketed in 85 countries around the world.
   Here is a brief history of New York-based Avon:
   _1886 _ David H. McConnell, a former door-to-door book seller,
founds a direct-selling fragrance firm in New York that he calls
California Perfume Co. because he thinks the state's name conjures
up the excitement of the gold rush days.
   _1887 _ McConnell builds a manufacturing laboratory in Suffern,
N.Y., to supplement the work being done at a small warehouse near
Wall Street in New York City. The company issues its first
illustrated catalog.
   _1905 _ California Perfume Co. starts advertising in Good
Housekeeping magazine.
   _1926 _ Sales surpass $2 million.
   -  1946 _ California Perfume Co. becomes a public company.
   _1949 _ Sales reach $25 million.
   _1950 _ California Perfume Co. is renamed Avon Products Inc. The
name was first used by one of the company's organizations in 1930
to link it with William Shakespeare's legendary home,
Stratford-on-Avon, England.
   _1950s _ Avon's growth accelerates so the company opens new
distribution centers.
   _1959 _ Domestic independent Avon sales representatives total
125,000. Sales reach $168 million.
   _1960s _ Avon's overseas expansion spurs sales growth. Avon is
especially successful in Latin America and its four key foreign
markets become Brazil, Mexico, Japan and the United Kingdom.
   _1970s _ Sales start to show signs of weakening but introduction
of jewelry products helps generate revenue. Avon stock hits an
all-time high of $143 a share in 1973.
   _1970s _ Avon tries to speed up flagging revenue growth by
branching out into other businesses. It opens a direct-mail women's
apparel division and a direct-mail magazine subscription operation.
   _1979 _ Avon acquires Tiffany &amp; Co., the world-famous jewelry
retailer.
   _1982 _ Avon enters the health care services industry by
purchasing Mallinckrodt Inc., a medical products and specialty
chemicals company.
   _1984 _ Avon acquires Foster Medical Corp., a home health care
company, and begins a series of restructurings by selling off
Tiffany.
   _1985 _ Avon purchases Retirement Inns of America Inc.
   _1986 _ Avon buys Mediplex Group Inc., a provider of care to
sick and elderly, and sells off Great American Magazines and
Mallinckrodt.
   _1987 _ Forty percent of Avon-Japan, the largest foreign
cosmetics company in Japan, is sold off to Japanese investors. Avon
sells the medical supply division of Foster Medical Corp and the
Direct Response Division.
   Avon acquires Giorgio Beverly Hills Inc. and Perfumes Stern Inc.
The fragrance firms together comprise Avon's retail division, which
owns some of the top-selling scents in the United States, including
Giorgio and a new one called Red. The division sells through
department stores and other retail vendors instead of through Avon
sales reps.
   _1988 _ Avon announces plan to divest the rest of its health
care services. Sale of Foster Medical is completed in August.
Revenue comes to $3.06 billion but company loses $404.5 million,
due to loss from discontinued operations.
   _1989 _ Avon receives $39-a-share takeover offer from Amway
Corp., a private direct-selling firm based in Ada, Mich. The bid
values Avon at about $2.1 million, based on nearly 54 million Avon
common shares outstanding. Avon Chairman James E. Preston says the
company is not for sale but the board will examine the proposal.

   Amway Corp.'s motivational literature is sprinkled with stories
of how dedication pays off handsomely for its distributors.
   The Ada, Mich.-based direct seller has been characterized as a
company that preaches patriotism, free enterprise and an
evangelistic approach to marketing everything from soaps to bug
sprays to office coffee makers, and long-distance telephone service
from MCI Communications Corp.
   In a book about Amway called ``The Possible Dream,'' successful
Amway distributor Art Charlton of Westboro, Mass., was quoted as
giving his impression of Amway in this way:
   ``It's hard for me to describe how I feel about Amway ... I feel
like I've walked into a great big field of strawberries _ juicy and
ripe and luscious _ just acres of them _ and I have a small little
basket. There's just so much more than we can take ...''
   Here are some facts about Amway:
   _The company was founded in 1959 by entrepreneurs Jay Van Andel
and Richard DeVos. It is a private company and ownership of it is
believed to be closely held by the co-founders. Van Andel is
chairman of the board and DeVos is president.
   _Over 300 items carry the Amway name, ranging from household
cleansers to products in the health care and fitness field.
   _Amway has more than 1 million distributors that operate as
independent business people selling Amway products and some goods
and services from outside companies in the United States and 40
other countries and territories.
   _With $1.8 billion in sales for the year ended Aug. 31, 1988,
the company is estimated to be the second largest direct-selling
firm after Avon Products Inc.
   _Amway forged a partnership with Minneapolis-based investor
Irwin L. Jacobs and together they bought shares of Avon, amassing a
10.3 percent stake by early May.
   _On its own, Amway has made a $39-a-share takeover proposal to
Avon, a bid that values Avon at about $2.1 billion. Amway says if
gets control of Avon, it intends to spin off Avon's retail
division, which turns out some of the country's top-selling
fragrances such as Giorgio, Red and Oscar de la Renta.
   _Amway says it may consider launching a hostile attempt to
acquire Avon and would explore the possibility of selling some Avon
assets to Jacobs if the takeover is completed.

<HEAD>Beverage And Tobacco CEOs Were Highest-Paid Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief executives in the beverage and tobacco
industries were, as a group, the highest-paid CEOs at the nation's
biggest companies, according to a list compiled by Forbes magazine.
   The survey released today ranks by 1988 compensation the chief
executives of the nation's 800 largest public companies.
   CEOS at beverage and tobacco companies earned a median $1.51
million, followed by chief executives in communications and media
and CEOs of financial service companies, who dropped to third place
after three years in first, Forbes says in its forthcoming May 29
issue.
   The $1.51 million median compensation of the 10 beverage and
tobacco CEOs in the survey was up 30 percent from 1987, Forbes said.
   The median is the level where half the executives earned more
and half earned less. Compensation includes salary, bonuses and
long-term compensation including gains from the exercise of stock
options.
   Median compensation was $1.47 million for the communications and
media chieftains, $1.34 million for the financial services bosses,
$1.32 million food-processing chiefs, and $1.30 million for CEOs of
surface transportation companies.
   Rounding out the top 10, median compensation for CEOs was $1.25
million in leisure and recreation, $1.20 million in health, $1.19
million in industrial and office services, $1.18 million in
consumer products and $1.11 million in conglomerates.
   Lowest-paid on the list were chief executives of electric
utilities, whose median compensation was $441,000, considerably
behind the second-to-last CEOs of food distributors, at $589,000.
   Business Week magazine released a similar survey last month that
included top bosses other than chief executives. Forbes said its
survey covers many chief executives that Business Week did not list.
   Forbes and Business Week agreed that Michael D. Eisner of Walt
Disney Co. was the nation's highest-paid CEO last year, with total
compensation of $40.1 million. But Forbes gave second place to
Steven J. Ross of Warner Communications Inc. at $14.2 million.
   Ross was not on the Business Week list. A spokeswoman for
Business Week said that since the list came out ahead of Forbes',
some 1988 financial information was not yet available.

   Gold edged lower.
   With European markets open only in Britain and Italy because of

   An investor group composed of a New York
investment firm and a group linked to the Bass family of Texas will
put up at least $400 million to back a Pan Am Corp. bid for the
parent of Northwest Airlines.
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and Airlie Group L.P. have
confirmed their financial backing for a possible Pan Am offer for
NWA Inc., Pan Am said in a prepared statement Sunday.
   Besides providing equity itself, Prudential-Bache anticipated it
would arrange for the rest of the required financing, Pan Am said.
   Airlie includes Equitable Life Insurance Co. and individual
investors including Sid and Lee Bass of Texas' Bass family.
   Financially-troubled Pan Am, parent of Pan American World
Airways, said last week it might make a bid in response to NWA's
general request for buyout proposals.
   NWA, the nation's fourth-largest airline, has received an
unsolicited $2.7 billion offer from oilman Marvin Davis that NWA's
board has rejected as inadequate.
   Pan Am, the No. 8-ranked airline in the Unites States, will
decide whether to bid for Northwest after it has a chance to study
the larger airline's books, Pamela Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman,
said Sunday.
   Ms. Hanlon said Pan Am officials also wanted to discuss the
possible bid with its employees.
   NWA has set a June 2 deadline for submission of bids.
   Some analysts have said Pan Am sees a marriage with Northwest as

<HEAD>K mart Earnings Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp., the nation's second-largest
retailer, today reported a 22 percent decline in quarterly earnings
caused mainly by lower-than-anticipated sales, increased costs and
higher advertising expenses.
   The company said during the 13 weeks ended April 26, it earned
$94.1 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with profits of $120.4
million, or 60 cents a share, for the corresponding period last
year.
   Sales for the period this year, the retailer's first quarter,
were $6.07 billion, up 3.9 percent from $5.84 billion in sales
during the same time last year.
   ``These results are disappointing,'' K mart Chairman Joseph
Antonini said. ``The drop in earnings was the results of a sales
shortfall from plan.
   ``Cooler-than-normal weather during March and the first two
weeks of April adversely affected sales of outdoor patio goods and
plants, both very important seasonal lines, ...'' he added, ``and
also hurt sales of our apparel lines.
   The company, the largest U.S. retailer after Sears, Roebuck and
Co., also said it spent more for advertising, to open new stores
and paid more into employee pensions.
   ``We are encouraged by the marked improvement in sales in the
last two weeks of April and early May,'' Antonini said.
   K mart posted 1988 sales of $27.8 billion. In addition to K mart
discount stores, the corporation operates Waldenbooks, Builders
Square and Pay Less Drug Stores.

<HEAD>Tyson Extends Offer After Attempt to Settle Chicken War Falls Through</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc. today extended its $63.50-a-share offer for
Holly Farms Corp. until May 19 after the failure of a weekend
effort to settle the tug of war between Tyson and rival suitor
ConAgra Inc.
   Tyson said in a news release today that as of the close of
business Friday it had received tenders of about 10.3 million
shares of Holly Farms' outstanding 18.4 million shares of common
stock. The previous deadline for the expiration of Tyson's cash
offer had been last Friday.
   Hoping to end the seven-month-long takeover tussle, poultry
producer Holly Farms on Friday asked both Tyson of Springdale, Ark.
and ConAgra of Omaha, Neb., to submit revised bids and resolve
their disputes over the weekend, ConAgra said in a news release
Sunday.
   ``Pursuant to Holly Farms' invitation, ConAgra and Holly Farms
were to reach settlement, subject to court approval, of all
litigation between the companies, and both Tyson and ConAgra were
requested to submit new bids,'' ConAgra said.
   ConAgra considered the matter, but by noon Saturday, Holly Farms
cancelled a board meeting that had been set for Sunday, apparently
to hear details of any settlement. The meeting was cancelled at
Tyson's request, ConAgra said.
   ConAgra said the Holly Farms' board might reschedule a meeting
sometime during this week.
   The Omaha company said it will continue looking at its options,
including:
   _Not making a new bid for Holly Farms and pursuing litigation
under existing contracts between ConAgra and Holly Farms.
   _Not making a new bid for Holly Farms and obtaining a financial
settlement from Holly Farms and-or Tyson over the litigation.
   _Making a new bid for Holly Farms.
   _Settling its litigation and making a new bid for Holly Farms.
   The battle for Holly Farms began in October, when Tyson began a
takeover bid for the rival poultry processor. Holly Farms spurned
the offer and reached a merger agreement with ConAgra in November
in an effort to keep Tyson at bay.
   The battle has since moved to the Delaware courts, where Tyson
is contesting an agreement between ConAgra and Holly Farms, giving
the Omaha company the right to buy some of Holly Farm's more
valuable assets if the merger was not consummated. All three
poultry companies are incorporated in Delaware.

   The stock market gained ground today, following
through on Friday's strong rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.75 to 2,442.45 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 27.35 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said Friday's rally prompted buying of stocks by money
managers at investing institutions who were fearful of missing out
on a continuing advance in stock prices.
   The catalyst for the market's latest upsurge came Friday in the

   As the new trading week began, there was talk of more favorable
inflation news to come when the monthly data on the consumer price
index are issued on Thursday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .07 to 175.20. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .03 at 348.33.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.82 points to
2,439.70, its highest level since the October 1987 stock market
collapse and the biggest daily gain since a 74.68-point rise on May
31, 1988.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 10 to 3 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed issues, with 1,214 up, 360 down
and 410 unchanged.

<TEXT>
   The oil and gas rig count climbed for the second
straight week, increasing by seven this week to 771, Baker Hughes
Inc. reported Monday.
   Last week, the number of working oil and gas rigs rose by 13 to
total 764 while the previous week, the count fell by 16 to total
751, the company said. A year ago, the count totaled 883.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Wyoming had the biggest gain
with eight; followed by Louisiana, three; North Dakota, two; and
Michigan, Ohio, and Texas, one each.
   Oklahoma had the largest decrease _ four rigs, while California
and New Mexico dropped one each.
   Colorado and Pennsylvania remained the same as last week.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York hotel owner Leona Helmsley failed
today in a Supreme Court attempt to win a special pretrial hearing
in her prosecution on charges of federal income tax evasion.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Mrs.
Helmsley cannot now appeal the trial judge's denial of such a
hearing.
   Mrs. Helmsley and her husband, Harry, were indicted with two
hotel executives a year ago on charges they evaded some $1.2
million in federal taxes over a three-year period.
   The Helmsleys on April 3 lost a Supreme Court appeal aimed at
quashing the 47-count indictment against them.
   That appeal raised the same issue decided by the high court in
another case March 28.
   In that ruling, the justices said federal criminal defendants
who fail to persuade a judge to throw out their indictment because
of alleged misconduct by prosecutors cannot appeal before they are
tried and convicted.
   The Helmselys' appeal rejected by the court in April raised the
issue of pre-indictment publicity generated by federal prosecutors.
   The appeal acted on today raised a separate issue _ Mrs.
Helmsley's asserted right to a pretrial hearing on her claim that
the prosecution against her was based on immunized testimony.
   Justice Department lawyers told the court that the March 28
decision also makes Mrs. Helmsley's appeal premature.
   The case is Helmsley vs. U.S., 88-1348.

<HEAD>GE To Close Two Factories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co., in a move to
consolidate operations, is eliminating 1,400 jobs and closing two
factories that manufacture electric ranges, the company said today.
   The two plants being closed are in Dalton, Ga., and Columbia,
Md. Both plants will be put up for sale by Fairfield-based GE.
   Most of the 900 jobs in Maryland will be eliminated and factory
operations will be phased out over the next 18 months, said GE
spokesman James Allen.
   Allen said the company would attempt to help workers find new
jobs with other employers.
   The Dalton plant was part of the Roper Corp., which GE bought
last year. GE plans to shift business from that factory to a larger
Roper plant in Lafayette, Ga.
   The closing of the Dalton plant will eliminate 100 jobs. But
those 100 workers will be offered jobs at the Lafayette plant,
which is 30 miles across the border, Allen said.
   The Dalton plant will be closed in mid-July, and Allen said the
company doesn't know how many workers will agree to relocate.
   GE also plans to reduce its hourly employment at its electric
range plant in Lousiville, Ky., from 1,500 to 1,100 by mid-1991.
Allen said GE expects to meet its goal there through attrition.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade, in a market largely influenced by
weather forecasts.
   Corn and soybean prices were higher as traders reacted to the
National Weather Service's 30-day forecast, released Friday, which
calls for below normal precipitation in the Midwest.
   Wheat prices were lower on reports of rain in winter crop areas
over the weekend and a forecast for-above normal precipitation in
the Central Plains.
   Trading is expected to be on the quiet side today due to a lack
of direction from European markets, closed because of a holiday.
   In early trading, wheat was 2} cents to 4{ cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.18 a bushel; corn was } cent to

<TEXT>
   Teachers in the nation's second-largest
school district went on strike today for the first time in 19
years, threatening to create chaos for nearly 600,000 students in
the final weeks of school.
   ``The education process will come to a complete halt,'' warned
Don Schrack, spokesman for the teachers union, United Teachers-Los
Angeles.
   Early indications were that Schrack was right. Students drifted
away from schools or prepared to sit out the day under the watch of
hastily hired substitutes.
   ``We're going to be stuck in a gym. All we're gonna do is sit
and vegetate,'' complained 15-year-old Hamilton High School
freshman Maureen Lim as teachers marched in front of the building
in West Los Angeles.
   United Teachers-Los Angeles, representing 22,000 teachers, is
demanding a 21 percent pay hike over two years and more control
over classrooms. Although district administrators said schools
would remain open with substitute teachers, union President Wayne
Johnson called that ``a joke, at best.''
   Johnson, who joined picketing teachers at Hamilton High, said
informal talks would be held again today with the district, but no
formal negotiations had been set.
   ``I'm hopeful that it won't go more than two or three days,'' he
said of the strike. ``There's still a possibility that might
happen, but that depends on the board.''
   Signs carried by picketing teachers read ``We Deserve Better''
and ``We Need Equal Say and Fair Pay.''
   Attendance figures for the district's more than 600 schools
schools were still being taken early today, so the effect on
district-wide attendance could not immediately be determined.
   The first picket lines formed at about 2 a.m. when about 30
teachers marched in front of district warehouses in an attempt to
block Teamsters union drivers from delivering food later this
morning.
   ``For too long teachers and students have been at the end of the
pecking line instead of at the front where they should be,'' said
one of the pickets, Leo Hildebrand, a fifth grade teacher at
Garvanza Elementary School.
   By 6 a.m., picket lines were forming in front of schools.
   ``Enough is enough,'' said teacher Carole Rosen-Kaplan, one of
about 30 pickets at the Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, a
section of the suburban San Fernando Valley. ``We've taken all the
insults we're going to take.''
   Board of Education President Roberta Weintraub, speaking for the
majority on a deeply divided school board, said the district would
not budge from what she termed one of the best contract offers for
teachers in the nation.
   ``The lines on this issue have been clearly drawn and the ball
is in the union's court,'' she said.
   The strike deadline was pushed up two weeks, from May 30 to May
15, when Superintendent Leonard Britton refused to authorize pay
for teachers who failed to turn in final grades.
   About 500 hastily hired substitutes and another 500 credentialed
administrators lined up to teach the district's 594,000 students.
   Johnson ridiculed the plans, saying, ``The district can't
provide enough substitutes on a normal day.''
   With five weeks remaining before summer vacation, the strike
threatened to create havoc at the schools, with high absenteeism,
large and unruly classrooms, and students' final grades determined
by substitutes.
   The school year ends June 23 for students and June 26 for
teachers.
   ``We are really hoping we can keep our schools open as safely as
possible, and to that end, of course, the district will be working
night and day,'' Weintraub said.
   Teachers stood by their demands for higher pay and more say in
how schools are run.
   United Teachers-Los Angeles, which represents 22,000 of the
32,000 teachers, nurses and counselors, has been locked in a
contract battle with the district for more than a year.
   The union has been adamant in its demand for a 21 percent pay
increase over two years and the elimination of unpaid, non-teaching
duties such as school yard supervision and after-school meetings.
It also seeks to give teachers more influence in how their
classrooms are run.
   The district has offered teachers a 21.5 percent pay raise over
three years _ with the possibility of more money if an anticipated
increase in state revenue materializes.
   The sprawling Los Angeles Unified School District, with a
student body that speaks 85 languages, is second in size to New
York City and hasn't been struck by teachers since a 23-day walkout
in 1970.
   Los Angeles teachers' salaries start at $23,440 and can go as
high as $43,319. Administrators' salaries range from $37,000 to
$95,600.
   The average U.S. teacher salary is $29,567, according to the
National Education Association. Average salaries range from $20,480
in South Dakota to $41,693 in Alaska.
   The New York City school district, the nation's largest, pays
teachers from $23,000 to $45,800.

   A bankruptcy judge postponed a hearing today on
the sale of Eastern Airlines' prized Northeast Shuttle to property
billionaire Donald Trump after the strike-crippled carrier
requested a 24-hour delay to consider a rival bid from America West
Airlines.
   Federal Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland set a new hearing date
for 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday after Eastern attorney Deryck Palmer told
him the airline needs more time to consider the America West offer.
   Trump, an Atlantic City casino developer and Manhattan real
estate mogul, has agreed to pay $365 million for the Washington-New
York-Boston service, one of the most heavily traveled air routes in
the country.
   Trump's agreement with Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern's
parent Texas Air Corp., expires on May 27. Under their contract,
the developer would receive $8 million from Eastern if the deal
collapses.
   Phoenix-based America West announced last Wednesday it was
offering to pay $415 million for the shuttle and $336 million for
10 Boeing 757s in a total package worth $751 million.
   Trump said afterward he found it ``hard to believe that any bank
or responsible financial institution would loan (America West) the
money to purchase the very troubled shuttle operation of Eastern
for such an inflated price.''
   Eastern's shuttle was its most profitable operation before the
airline was struck on March 4. Since then, it has been running near
full schedule but with sharply reduced loads as many passengers
have defected to Pan Am Corp.'s rival service.
   Miami-based Eastern has been under Chapter 11 protection from
creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a Machinists
union strike supported by pilots and flight attendants that
virtually grounded the airline.
   The bankruptcy court must approve any sale of Eastern or any of
its assets, including the shuttle service.
   On Saturday, a group headed by Chicago commodities trader Joseph
Ritchie formally submitted a proposal to buy the entire airline,
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Saturday.
   Lifland had given the Ritchie group an extension to 11 a.m. EDT
Saturday of a Wednesday bidding deadline to allow it time to study
confidential financial data on Eastern.
   The Ritchie group's offer was the second formal bid received by
the bankruptcy court, according to sources close to the situation.
On Wednesday, an investor group led by William Howard, the former
chairman of Piedmont Airlines, submitted its bid before the 5 p.m.
deadline set by Lifland, the sources said.
   The investment firm Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. is a
participant in the Howard group.
   Billionaire hotelier Jay Pritzker already has proposed buying
all of Eastern for around $500 million, although it is unclear
whether he has submitted a formal offer.
   The proposal made by the Ritchie group would temporarily put
former defense secretary Frank Carlucci in charge of Eastern,
Ritchie said in an interview with The New York Times. He did not
disclose details of the bid.
   Carlucci had been tapped by the unions earlier in the Eastern
bankruptcy as a possible temporary trustee who would take over
control of the airline from Lorenzo.
   The trustee issue was at the heart of the mid-April collapse of
former baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth's $464 million deal
to buy Eastern. The unions wanted an outsider to run the airline
but Lorenzo rejected that.

between investors who allege fraud and their brokers must be
resolved by arbitration, not in court suits.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices overturned a 1953 high court
decision that permitted lawsuits under an anti-fraud provision of
the Securities Act of 1933.
   In its history, the high court has reversed itself fewer than
200 times.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, said the 1953
decision ``has fallen far out of step with our current strong
endorsement'' of federal laws that favor arbitration.
   ``Our conclusion is reinforced by our assessment that resort to
the arbitration process does not inherently undermine any of the
substantive rights afforded (investors) under the Securities Act,''
he said.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, accused the
court of unwarranted judicial activism that ignores the will of
Congress.
   ``Judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion
public policy are less hesitant to change the law than those of use
who are inclined to give wide latitutde to the views of the voters'
representatives on non-constitutional matters,'' he said.
   Joining Kennedy were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
Dissenting with Stevens were Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun.
   The case stems from a challenge by 17 first-time investors to
standard brokerage contracts that order arbitration to settle all
disputes.
   Today's ruling affirms a decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, which reversed a ruling by a lower federal court in
Bronwsville, Texas.
   The investors, some of whom could not understand English,
included minors, widows and people dying of cancer.
   They opened securities accounts in 1982 and 1983 with the
Shearson Lehman Hutton office in Brownsville, doing business with
account manager Jon Grady Deaton.
   The investors claimed Deaton mismanaged separate accounts
totaling some $190,000, and conducted unauthorized transactions to
generate commissions and profits.
   Shearson _ which is now Shearson@American Express _ went to
federal court to enforce the arbitration agreements in the
contracts. But the lower court cited the Supreme Court's 1953
decision against arbitration that permitted a court suit.
   The company then appealed, citing a 1987 high court ruling that
said claims against brokers made under the federal Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 should be arbitrated.
   Kennedy said today the 1933 and 1934 laws should be in harmony
to discourage investors from manipulating complaints _ allowing
them to go to court if they invoked the earlier law.
   The case is Quijas vs. Shearson@American Express, 88-385.

   Hanson PLC said Monday that earnings jumped 23
percent in the first half of its fiscal year, with all divisions of
the multinational conglomerate contributing to the performance.
   Hanson said earnings in the six months ended March 31 came to
598 million pounds, or about $981 million, after an extraordinary
gain of 258 million pounds, or $423 million. In the same period a
year ago, an extraordinary gain of 211 million pounds, or $346
million, boosted earnings to 486 million pounds, or $797 million.
   Earnings per share were 7.9 pence, or 13 cents, vs. 6.6 pence,
or 11 cents.
   Revenue increased 1 percent to 3.77 billion pounds $6.2 billion,
from 3.72 billion pounds, or $6.1 billion.
   Company Chairman Lord Hanson said all the company's divisions
both in Britain and the United States added to the profit gains.
   ``Our management teams will continue to maximize shareholder
return on investment. Corporate confidence is high and the
prospects for 1989 and beyond are excellent,'' he said.
   The company didn't break out quarterly results. It isn't
required to under British law.

   The stock market kept climbing today, following
through on Friday's strong rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 56.82 points on
Friday to a new high since the 1987 crash, rose 18.14 to 2,457.84
by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 7 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 735 up, 534 down and
482 unchanged.
   Analysts said Friday's rally prompted buying of stocks by money
managers at investing institutions who were fearful of missing out
on a continuing advance in stock prices.
   The catalyst for the market's latest upsurge came Friday in the
government's report of a smaller-than-expected 0.4 percent increase
in the producer price index of finished goods in April.
   That sent open-market interest rates tumbling, and increased
hopes that the Federal Reserve was succeeding in its effort to curb
inflation without pushing the economy into a recession.
   As the new trading week began, there was talk of more favorable
inflation news to come when the monthly data on the consumer price
index are issued on Thursday.
   Hewlett-Packard led the active list, down 4\ at 52~. The company
said its operating results for the fiscal quarter ended April 30
fell short of analysts' estimates.

<HEAD>Company Unveils VDT That Gives Off No Radiation To User</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer monitor that emits no radiation to
the user was unveiled Monday by a small Massachusetts company that
said it would be good for pregnant women and others possibly at
risk from VDT emissions.
   There are no surveys conclusively showing any danger from the
radiation given off by video display terminals. VDTS emit electric
radiation and magnetic radiation, which are different from the
ionizing radiation of X-rays.
   Safe Computing Co. of Needham, Mass., said its Safe Monitors
sell for $995, three or four times as much as conventional
one-color computer monitors.
   ``Women who hear about this want it,'' said George S. Lechter,
the company's president and owner.
   He said the screens could be moved from one terminal to another.
   Instead of a television-like tube, the monitor uses a
low-radiation, Japanese-made liquid crystal display like the ones
used in laptop computers. Radiation is further reduced with four
shields. Two strong lights in back compensate for the dimming
caused by the shields.
   Safe Computing cited a study by Kaiser Permanente Medical Care
Group Inc. in Oakland, Calif., which said that certain women who
used VDTs more than 20 hours a week in their first three months of
pregnancy were almost twice as likely to have a miscarriage as
non-VDT users.
   However, that study team said the findings didn't necessarily
mean VDTs themselves were the sole cause of the reproductive
problem, since the study didn't measure other potentially relevant
factors such as stress felt by heavy VDT users, as well as eye
strain, uncomfortable seating and restricted movement.
   Also, the higher miscarriage rate showed up in only one of the
groups of women studied, administrative and clerical workers.

<HEAD>Shareholders Pat NWA On Back For Handling Of Takeover Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders praised NWA Inc. for what
they called its graceful handling of an unwelcome takeover battle
that the parent of Northwest Airlines has been mired in for the
past 45 days.
   ``I would say they've done a good job of keeping it orderly,''
said Paul Carroll, a shareholder from St. Paul.
   Shareholders at the meeting overwhelmingly elected the company's
11 nominees for one-year terms on the board of directors. They also
sided with management by rejecting a proposal that would have
required the board of directors to give Northwest employees an
opportunity to match any offer from a third party to buy the
company. The proposal was drafted prior to the takeover activity.
   Even William Mahlum, the attorney who helped draft the failed
proposal, commended NWA management for its measured response to a
takeover battle that erupted March 30 when oil billionaire Marvin
Davis submitted an unsolicited bid of $2.7 billion, or $90 a share,
to buy the nation's fourth-largest airline.
   ``To this point they have handled it responsibly,'' Mahlum said.
``It will probably go to the highest bidder. That's good for the
shareholders but not necessarily good for employees. There's no way
to preserve the rights of the employees when the sharks swim in
these rich waters.''
   The three unions representing Northwest's 35,000 employees fear
that a possible debt-financed takeover of the airline would burden
the carrier with excessive debt and result in wage concessions, job
reductions or the sale of strategic assets. About a dozen of the
company's 5,000 pilots picketed the meeting to demonstrate their
concerns.
   ``Airline for sale,'' one of the picket signs said. ``Cash only.
No credit.''
   Among the groups interested in buying Northwest are Davis, Pan
Am Corp., the takeover firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the
airline's machinists' union and a friendly partnership led by Los
Angeles investor Al Checchi. Pan Am on Sunday said its financial
backers would put up at least $400 million in equity if Pan Am
makes an offer.
   Shareholders interviewed at the meeting were pleased that NWA
rejected Davis' offer and announced that it would consider other
proposals. The stock has been trading for more than $100 a share in
anticipation Davis' bid will be topped.
   Davis threatened a proxy fight to unseat NWA's board of
directors at the annual meeting, but he chose to drop his plan to
participate in the bidding process under ground rules set by
Northwest in a May 2 agreement.
   ``I think the board is most interested in the process being
properly handled,'' said Frank Fox, a shareholder from Florida. ``I
can't fault them.''
   Another shareholder asked during the meeting what shareholders
could do to keep the company independent. Chairman Steven Rothmeier
declined to comment, joking that he could go to jail for spilling
insider information.
   ``I like pin stripes and not three-inch black-and-white
stripes,'' Rothmeier said in one of the few spontaneous moments at
the meeting.
   The chairman said nothing new about the takeover battle, which
heated up Sunday with Pan Am's announcement. Davis is the only
other suitor to dislose a financial details and his bid is said to
include about $300 million in equity.
   Alan Muncaster, a Northwest spokesman, said the company would
not comment on the announcement by Pan Am, the nation's
eighth-largest airline.
   Pan Am has nearly $1 billion in debts and is about half the size
of Northwest but has the financial backing of a group that includes
Sid and Lee Bass of Texas' billionaire Bass family and the
Equitable Life Insurance Co.
   Jim Halvorson, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association
at Northwest, said a $400 million equity stake would be
insufficient for a new owner. The pilots have been warning suitors
that they are a force to be reckoned with because they have yet to
agree on a new contract.
   Back pay alone could cost the airline $300 million and a strike
could be even more costly, Halvorson said.
   Rothmeier, in his prepared remarks at the meeting, said an
agreement with the pilots is one of three major goals for 1989. He
also said Northwest will unveil what he called a new corporate
image May 23. Muncaster said the revamped image will include a
revised color scheme that will be ``evolutionary, not
revolutionary.''

   Share prices rose Monday in subdued trading on the
London Stock Exchange, boosted by Wall Street's healthy performance
Friday and a strong advance by the dollar.
   Traders said the London market showed a fairly strong undertone
but that activity was dampened by a transportation strike that
paralyzed much of the city and kept many market players out of
their offices. It also suffered late in the day from Wall Street's
slower pace Monday.
   At the close of trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 14.2 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,149.9. The
closing level fell short of a midafternoon high of 2,153.6, but was
above the early morning low of 2,145.2.
   Volume remained light at 411.0 million shares, down from 532.7
million Friday.
   Traders said the market lost momentum after a strong start,
slowing somewhat on U.S. industrial production figures that fell
short of expectations and sluggish gains on Wall Street as the U.S.
market struggled to maintain its advance from Friday.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 8.1 points at 1,787.2
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 7.47 points

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with weather-related news

   ``Conditions (in the fields) overall are not ideal, but not bad

<HEAD>Farm Bureau President Says Apples Safe Despite Alar Scare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARK RIDGE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers have nothing to fear from
apples, even those that have been treated with the chemical Alar,
according to the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation.
   Dean Kleckner joined an apple grower and two scientists Monday
on a telephone news conference to complain that a televised report
about Alar on ``60 Minutes'' had caused unnecessary fear.
   ``Food quality in this country is the safest in the world,''
said Kleckner. ``The facts remain the same. The FDA (U.S. Food and
Drug Administration) and the surgeon general say consumers can eat
apples without any qualms.''
   Alar is a chemical used to regulate growth and extend the shelf
life of apples, among other purposes.
   But it has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.
   ``That does not translate into an impending disease in
individuals ... from whatever (apples) are left in the pipeline,''
said Dr. Sorell Schwartz, a professor of pharmacology at Georgetown
University.
   The apple industry says sales have been reduced dramatically by
consumer reaction to news reports focusing on assertions that Alar
poses a serious cancer risk, especially to children.
   Kleckner said apple growers had lost $150 million before
Sunday's ``60 Minutes'' report on Alar.
   Burt Chestnut, a Wenatchee, Wash., apple grower participating in
the conference call, said he stopped using Alar two years ago on
his 50-acre orchard.
   ``We are good farmers and we can grow apples without Alar,''
said Chestnut, who explained that the chemical helped make the
apples firmer and kept them on the trees longer. ``We'll do without
it.''
   But the Alar scare has made it difficult to sell any apples,
said Chestnut, who estimated he has lost $30,000 so far.
   ``We're working for nothing this year,'' said Chestnut.
   Meanwhile, consumer advocate Ralph Nader told a U.S. Senate
panel Monday that Alar should be banned immediately.
   He told the subcommittee on toxic substances that there is now
``a convergence'' of interest between consumers who don't want Alar
on apples and growers who are hurt by the bad publicity and poor
sales.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced over the
weekend that it has started a procedure that could lead to an Alar
ban in about 18 months.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., whose state is a major producer of
apples, said Congress could act much more quickly than the EPA.
   ``We could simply pass a law tomorrow unilaterally banning Alar
and put that behind us,'' said Warner. ``I think we need some
swift, decisive action to restore confidence in the marketplace.''
   Schwartz said during the telephone news conference that ``Alar
is doomed,'' though he stressed there was no reason to fear any
apples or apple products currently on the market.
   Kleckner said this may be the first shot in a new war on the
chemicals farmers use to produce food efficiently. He said
consumers are confused by ``emotional'' attacks on chemicals that
are not supported by the facts.
   ``Pulling apples off the shelf without any proof of danger is
real,'' he said. ``It's frightening that a whole industry can be
brought to its knees overnight.''

<HEAD>K mart Earnings Dip; Short-Term Sears Interest Part of Reason</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp., the nation's second-largest
retailer, Monday reported a 22 percent decline in quarterly
earnings caused mainly by lower-than-anticipated sales, increased
costs and higher advertising expenses.
   The sluggish sales at K mart stores partially reflected consumer
interest in a heavily advertised new low-price policy at rival
retailer Sears, Roebuck and Co., an analyst said.
   K mart reported it earned $94.1 million, or 47 cents a share,
for the quarter ended April 26, down from $120.8, or 60 cents a
share, during the same period a year ago.
   Sales for the first quarter of its fiscal year were $6.07
billion, up 3.9 percent from $5.84 billion in sales during the same
time last year.
   The company said higher-than-anticipated costs, including some
advertising expenses, affected the earnings.
   Retail analyst Steve Dimaggio of William C. Roney &amp; Co. in
Detroit said the introduction of an everyday low price strategy at
Sears in late February contributed to the drop in K mart's
earnings. At that time, Sears, the largest U.S. retailer, closed
its doors to mark down the prices of nearly all of its merchandise.
   ``Sears hurt them a little bit,'' he said. ``I think we might
see some of this (loss) come back. There always is a one-time
curiosity of where consumers will go'' when price reductions are
announced.
   The deterioration in K mart's profit didn't come as a surprise;
the company previously said its sales had suffered for a variety of
reasons, particularly because of unusually cold weather in early
spring.
   ``A couple of weeks back, they kind of warmed up the market that
their first quarter was going to be below expectations,'' Dimaggio
said. ``So that helped them soften the blow.''
   The company said it paid more for advertising and to open new
stores while also having higher outlays for employee pensions.
   K mart Chairman Joseph Antonini called the results
disappointing. He said cooler-than-normal weather during March and
the first two weeks of April adversely affected sales of outdoor
patio goods and plants.
   ``We are encouraged by the marked improvement in sales in the
last two weeks of April and early May,'' Antonini said.
   K mart reported $27.8 billion in sales last year. The
corporation operates 4,106 stores nationwide, including 2,269 K
mart discount stores, 1,230 Waldenbooks, 137 Builders Square and
271 Pay Less Drug Stores.

<HEAD>Court Says Investor-Broker Disputes Must be Arbitrated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an important victory for the securities
industry, the Supreme Court ruled Monday that disputes between
investors and brokers must be resolved by arbitration, not in court
suits.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices overturned a 1953 high court
decision that permitted lawsuits under an anti-fraud provision of
the Securities Act of 1933. The reversal was one of under 200 in
the court's history.
   The case stemmed from a challenge by 17 first-time investors to
standard brokerage contracts that order arbitration to settle all
disputes. The ruling affirmed a decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which reversed a ruling by a lower federal court
in Bronwsville, Texas.
   The investors, some of whom could not understand English,
included minors, widows and people dying of cancer.
   The case was widely watched by the securities industry, which
historically has supported arbitration in client-broker disputes,
arguing that this process saves brokerage firms enormous legal
costs.
   William Fitzpatrick, general counsel for the SIA: ``We are very
pleased with the ruling,'' said William Fitzpatrick general counsel
for the Securities Industry Association, an organization of
brokerages. ``This should go a long way toward avoiding confusion
by making all arbitration contracts enforcable as written, and it
should reduce a tremendous amount of expensive unnecessary and
time-consuming litigation.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, said the 1953
Supreme Court decision ``has fallen far out of step with our
current strong endorsement'' of federal laws that favor arbitration.
   ``Our conclusion is reinforced by our assessment that resort to
the arbitration process does not inherently undermine any of the
substantive rights afforded (investors) under the Securities Act,''
he said.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, accused the
court of unwarranted judicial activism that ignores the will of
Congress.
   ``Judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion
public policy are less hesitant to change the law than those of use
who are inclined to give wide latitutde to the views of the voters'
representatives on non-constitutional matters,'' he said.
   Joining Kennedy were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
Dissenting with Stevens were Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun.
   The investors opened securities accounts in 1982 and 1983 with
the predecessor of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Brownsville,
doing business with account manager Jon Grady Deaton.
   The investors claimed Deaton mismanaged separate accounts
totaling some $190,000, and conducted unauthorized transactions to
generate commissions and profits.
   Shearson, now owned by American Express, went to federal court
to enforce the arbitration agreements in the contracts. But the
lower court cited the Supreme Court's 1953 decision against
arbitration that permitted a court suit.
   The company then appealed, citing a 1987 high court ruling that
said claims against brokers made under the federal Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 should be arbitrated.
   In other business-related action, the court Monday:
   _Ruled that civil fines on top of criminal penalties may be a
form of unconstitutional double jeopardy. The ruling came in the
case of a New York City medical laboratory manager hit with
$131,170 in civil fines for defrauding the federal government of
$585 on Medicare bills.
   _Agreed to resolve a dispute stemming from the federal
government's efforts to protect American workers from hazardous
chemicals. The court said it will hear the Bush administration's
argument that a federal appeals court wrongly required that
additional information be supplied to employees.
   _Rejected a Bush administration appeal aimed at giving the
government more power to control rents for federally subsidized
housing. Without comment, the court refused to review a decision
favoring landlords in Washington state.
   _Let stand a ruling that New York hotel owner Leona Helmsley
cannot appeal a trial judge's denial of a special hearing in her
prosecution on charges of federal income tax evasion.

   The stock market rang up another gain today,
extending Friday's strong rally.
   Analysts said the surge on Friday prompted buying of stocks by
money managers at investing institutions who were fearful of
missing out on a continuing advance in stock prices.
   The catalyst for the market's latest advance came Friday in the
government's report of a smaller-than-expected 0.4 percent increase
in the producer price index of finished goods for April.
   That sent open-market interest rates tumbling, and increased
hopes that the Federal Reserve was succeeding in its effort to curb
inflation without pushing the economy into a recession.
   As the new trading week began, there was talk of more favorable
inflation news to come when the monthly data on the consumer price
index are issued on Thursday.

<HEAD>NBC Says `Roe Vs. Wade' Movie Was Fully Sponsored Despite Controversy</HEAD>

   NBC sold all of the available advertising time
in its made-for-TV movie about the case that legalized abortion but
had to sell some of the time at a discount and will lose money on
the show, a network executive said Monday.
   The movie, ``Roe Vs. Wade'' scheduled for broadcast Monday
night, had drawn criticism from a right-to-life group and a major
religious organization that said the movie took a pro-abortion
stance and urged advertisers to refuse to buy time on the program.
   But NBC President Robert Wright told the 100 biggest national
advertisers in a letter earlier this month that the movie presented
a balanced view of the abortion issue and that he intended to air
it even if there were no paying advertisers on the program. The
movie cost NBC about $4 million to produce.
   NBC spokesman Curt Block said Monday afternoon that all 14
minutes of available commercial time on the two-hour movie had been
sold although he conceded that the network cut its normal rate in
the past four or five days to find paid sponsors for some of the
time.
   He declined to say how much of the commercial time was sold at a
discount, nor would he say how deep the discounts were.
   He said the movie will probably lose money, but was unable to
confirm a published report that placed the anticipated loss at
about $1 million.
   Industry sources say that the going rate for a 30-second
commercial in that time period is about $180,000. Block declined
comment on that figure.
   Networks rarely have to discount prices for commercials in prime
time. If a network fails to find paying sponsors, it will often
fill the time with public service announcements run for free.
   In addition to the commercial sales, Block said that only one of
NBC's 208 affiliate stations had notified the network that they
intended to pre-empt the movie. The lone exception was the
affiliate in Kansas City, which was committed to running a baseball
telecast. NBC found another station in the market to run the movie,
he said.
   The uproar over ``Roe Vs. Wade'' is the latest in a series of
television programs triggering protests over the past several
months from individuals or groups or individuals who have found the
shows morally objectionable and have called on advertisers to
refrain from buying time.
   Among them have been NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' comedy show
and Fox Television's situation comedy, ``Married ... with
Children.''
   ABC recently pulled a show, ``Crimes of Passion II'' because it
couldn't sell any of the shows advertising time. The program
recreated brutal crimes.
   ``Roe Vs. Wade'' stars Holly Hunter as a character based on
Norma McCorvey, the then-anonymous ``Jane Roe'' plaintiff who sued
the Dallas District Attorney, Henry Wade, in an abortion case that
went to the Supreme Court.
   The movie is about the pro-choice advocates who prevailed in the
1973 Supreme Court decision, but it also portrays sympathetically
the prosecutors who argued the other side.
   In its effort to gain advertising support for the movie, NBC
took the unusual step of allowing advertisers to screen the movie
before deciding whether to sponsor it.
   Block said some advertisers who had made season-long commitments
to sponsoring Monday night movies withdrew, but other advertisers
emerged. He declined to identify them.
   ``It may be the advertising bargain of the year for some
advertisers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ruder Endorses Private-Sector Steps To Improve Market Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Monday endorsed a private-sector plan to strengthen
the critical back-office operations of the world's securities
markets.
   David S. Ruder said the international Group of Thirty, an ad-hoc
group of financial-industry leaders, was on the right track in its
plan to speed up and standardize the way markets arrange for trades
to be settled and paid for.
   The SEC is entitled to impose its own rules to reform the
back-office operations, but Ruder's speech showed he is willing to
let banks and securities firms take the lead.
   If it turns out the private companies cannot do the job on their
own, the SEC, Federal Reserve and Treasury Department could still
step in, said Lewis W. Bernard, a managing director at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co.
   ``I view it as a carrot and stick,'' said Bernard, a member of
the Group of Thirty steering committee. ``They can lose patience
with us and pre-empt the whole process.''
   Although back-office work is little-understood by most
investors, it is critical to the health of the financial markets.
An inefficient system raises the risk that a sharp decline in the
market could cause a devastating ripple of defaults, something
experts say almost happened in the October 1987 crash.
   ``We all know what the consequences are and they're extremely
unpleasant: financial gridlock,'' Bernard said.
   Bernard spoke at a news conference following a closed session at
which Ruder and other officials spoke to roughly 50 top officials
of the major exchanges and brokerage houses about the Group of
Thirty report.
   The text of Ruder's speech was released to reporters.
   In March, the private-sector Group of Thirty made nine major
recommendations for changes that it said should be carried out
around the world by 1992.
   The most important proposal is to shorten the lag between the
time a trade is made and the time the buyer receives the securities
and the seller is paid. Long delays increase the vulnerability of
the financial system.
   U.S. financial markets currently settle, or complete, trades
five business days after they are executed. The United States and
other nations are supposed to reduce that lag to three business
days by 1992.
   That speed-up will be the most difficult step for the United
States to carry out, according to David Kelly, a member of the U.S.
working committee of the Group of Thirty.
   The proposed changes will require banks and securities firms to
stay open longer hours, eventually around the clock; to form
tighter communications links with each other; and to install more
computer equipment to automate their paperwork.
   The three biggest securities markets _ the United States, Japan
and the United Kingdom _ are leading the efforts to improve the
international system.
   Others participating in the reform efforts include Canada,
Switzerland, West Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Hong Kong.

   Energy futures prices finished mixed in light
trading Monday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled
42 cents higher at $20.51 a 42-gallon barrel after rising 3 cents
on Friday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, June
heating oil, which rose 0.42 cent on Friday, gained another 0.77
cent to finish at 49.87 cents a gallon.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for June delivery slid 0.92 cent to
66.09 cents a gallon. On Friday the near-month contract was off
0.27 cent at the settlement.
   Andrew Lebow, an analyst at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said activity was quiet with most traders hunting for
opportunities to make profits from the price discrepancies among
the various energy futures contracts.
   This emphasis on spread trading was most pronounced in the crude
oil futures pit, he said, adding that traders were manuevering to
adjust their holdings ahead of the expiration next Monday of the
June contract.
   Gasoline futures declined due to abundant supplies in New York
harbor while a temporary tightness in local heating oil supplies
caused traders to bid up heating oil futures.

   The dollar surged in foreign exchange Monday,
reaching more than 2-year highs against several key currencies in
sometimes-hectic worldwide trading, despite continued central-bank
intervention.
   Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York said a
troy ounce of gold was bid at $374.10 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $2.15
from late Friday.
   Currency dealers said several factors helped strengthen the
dollar, including firmness in U.S. interest rates and political
instability in Japan due to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's
scandal-plagued resignation.
   Corporate currency buyers and speculators also have been
encouraged by the dollar's ability to shrug off last week's strong
intervention by central banks, dealers said.
   They said reports of moderate dollar-selling by the Bank of
Japan and the Federal Reserve throughout the trading session Monday
also did little to change market sentiment toward the dollar.
   ``It's clearly the preferred investment vehicle right now for
global investments,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a trader at Harris
Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago. ``It's kind of developing a bandwagon
effect.''
   The dollar was strongest against the West German mark in U.S.
dealings, reaching a nearly 2{-year high. It also rose sharply
against the Japanese yen and British pound, although profit-taking
brought it down from its highs of the day.
   In Europe, the dollar reached a 34-month high against the Swiss
franc, 28-month highs against the West German mark and the French
franc, a 19-month high against the British pound and an eight-month
high against the Italian lira.
   All European markets, except in Britain and Italy, were closed
Monday for the Pentecost holiday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar reached its highest level in 18 months,
closing up 1 Japanese yen at 136.80 yen. The dollar traded at
137.22 yen in London, and at 137.145 yen in New York, up from
136.10 yen Friday and the highest level since late December.
   In London, the British pound dropped to $1.6385 from $1.6615
Friday. Sterling fetched $1.6410 in New York, up from $1.6615, a
five-month high for the dollar.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates on
Friday, included: 1.9389 West German marks, up from 1.9195; 1.7370
Swiss francs, up from 1.7175; 1.1897 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1879; 6.5550 French francs, up from 6.4880; and 1,409.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,398.75.
   Late dollar rates in London, compared with rates in Europe late
Friday: 1.9415 German marks, up from 1.9195; 1.7438 Swiss francs,
up from 1.7080; 6.5725 French francs, up from 6.4870; 2.1905 Dutch
guilder, up from 2.1407; 1,411.00 Italian lire, up from 1,385.50;
1.1905 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1868.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $375.60 a troy ounce from $377.90 Friday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $374 a troy ounce,
down from $377 bid late Friday. Bullion markets were closed in
Zurich, Switzerland.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.99 to close at $375.30.
   Silver prices also lost ground. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery slipped to $5.491 a troy ounce from
$5.535 Friday. Silver fell sharply in London to $5.53 an ounce from
$5.63.

<UNK>Company Seeking Approval to Market Drug for Obesity, Bilumia</UNK>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly and Co. is seeking permission from
the Food and Drug Administration to market its drug Prozac for the
treatment of obesity and bulimia, the company said Monday.
   Lilly gain approval in 1987 to market the drug, known
generically as fluoxetine hydrochloride, as a treatment for
depression, but investment analysts have long speculated Prozac's
largest profit potential lies in treating weight disorders.
   Mel Perelman, president of Lilly Research Laboratories, made the
disclosure that the company would seek approval for the new
applications during a presentation Monday to the New York Society
of Investment Analysts.
   ``We've conducted clinical studies evaluating the use of
fluoxetine as a therapy for people who are obese or bulimic, and we
have submitted new drug application supplements fo the Food and
Drug Administration for both indications,'' Perelman said.
   Lilly also is studying fluoxetine as a possible treatment for
patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder or who want
to stop smoking, Perelman said.
   Some analysts have suggested Prozac could have worldwide sales
of $1 billion if it is used to treat obesity as well as depression.
   Prozac works by preventing nerve endings from re-absorbing a
chemical called serotonin, which has been linked to depression,
after it has been initially secreted by nerve endings.

<HEAD>Stock Up After After `20-20' Program Breaks No News on Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The news that sent the stock price of Dun &amp;
Bradstreet Corp. higher Monday was that there was no news at all.
   ABC's ``20-20'' news program broadcast a story Friday detailing
fraud allegations against the financial information services
company, but analysts said the show contained no new substantive
information and they recommended buying the stock.
   That sent Dun &amp; Bradstreet rising $2.37{ to $53.50 in active New
York Stock Exchange trading. Volume was 845,400 for a stock that
normally trades about 383,900 shares daily.
   Rumors spread on Wall Street last week that an unidentified
network news show was preparing a story on 148-year-old Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, which has been accused in a series of lawsuits of
duping clients into buying more credit rating information than they
needed.
   By the week's end, analysts who follow the company confirmed
that ``20-20,'' the prime-time show hosted by Hugh Downs and
Barbara Walters, was running the piece. The stock fell despite a
fairly strong market rally.
   Then the show came, it went and _ at least in Wall Street's eyes
_ it flubbed.
   ``To those who were watching closely, there was nothing
incremental in the story,'' said Eric Philo, a Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
analyst who reissued a buy recommendation Monday. ``It was
basically a rehash of what was known.''
   Asked if the ``20-20'' program and rumors leading up to it moved
the stock price last week and Monday, Philo said: ``Absolutely.
Zero question about it.''
   The ``20-20'' episode included interviews with two former Dun &amp;
Bradstreet salesmen who were fired from the company. They said they
had tried to expose improprieties at the stately and well-respected
corporation founded in 1841.
   ``It was certainly negative but it was nothing new,'' J.
Kendrick Noble, who follows the company for PaineWebber Inc., said
of the show.
   Former Dun &amp; Bradstreet employees accused the company of
misleading clients about how much credit rating service they
needed; lying about how much of the service clients needed and
used; and billing clients for service that was never delivered.
   ``The procedures are misrepresenting the facts to the customer
regarding the level of service they buy versus the amount of
service they use,'' said Gary Mertz, a national account
representative still with the company.
   Many Dun &amp; Bradstreet customers and former employees have made
accusations against the company. Clients and shareholders in at
least five states have filed suits seeking class action status
against the company. In Ohio, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service is
conducting a criminal fraud investigation.
   Last week, five New Jersey companies in separate suits accused
Dun &amp; Bradstreet Credit Services of fraud in misleading them to buy
more credit information than they needed.
   The claims were first reported in March in the Wall Street
Journal. Analysts said the stock has been stable despite the
allegations, trading at between $47 and $57 a share in the last
year.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet spokesman William F. Doescher declined to
comment on either the ``20-20'' show or earlier charges. The firm
has denied all charges.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet's credit reports provide information on a
company's credit history, including details on how fast bills are
paid. The reports are widely used by clients to make a variety of
business decisions.
   Despite the fraud charges, analysts are bullish on Dun &amp;
Bradstreet because of its overall performance. The company reported
first-quarter profits of $143 million, or 77 cents a share, on
revenue of $1.06 billion, both increases over the same 1988 period.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet also owns the Donnelly Yellow Pages operations,
the Nielsen television audience ratings and Moody's Investors
Service debt ratings. Its business services are marketed under the
names McCormack &amp; Dodge, Dataquest and Petroleum Information, among
others.
   ``I think the company is a real growth machine and not because
of anything fraudulent but because of its dominance in a variety of
areas in sophisticated information,'' Noble said.

<HEAD>High Inventories Push Down Copper Futures</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices closed sharply lower Monday
on New York's Commodity Exchange on word of a sharp rise in copper
stocks.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures were mostly lower,
precious metals futures were down, livestock and meat prices were
mixed and energy prices were mostly higher.
   Copper settled 2.20 cents to 4.95 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in May at $1.20 a pound.
   A 3,775-metric-ton rise in stocks reported by the London Metal
Exchange pushed down copper prices, said Bette Raptopoulos, an
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   In addition, the end of a three-day general strike in Peru
eliminates any risk of disruption ot Peruvian copper production,
Ms. Raptopoulos said.
   There also was some technical selling of copper futures, as
prices plunged below the key support figure of $1.20 for the June
contract, a figure that had held since February.
   Precious metals prices were forced lower by a strong dollar and
reaction to April's lower-than-expected producer-price index
figures that were released Friday. The figures showed a modest 0.4
percent increase, an indication that inflation has not taken off
yet.
   Gold was $2.40 to $3.40 lower, with May at $375.60 a troy ounce;
silver was 4.4 cents to 4.8 cents lower with May at $5.591 a troy
ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures were mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade, with weather-related news providing the only spur to trading.
   ``Conditions (in the fields) overall are not ideal, but not bad
enough to cause major concern,'' said Ted Mao, a grain specialist
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. ``The ebb and flow of
the market will persist until the weather takes a turn for the
better or the worse.''
   Soybean prices were pulled down by indications that a strong
dollar will cut into export demand, analysts said. Forecasts for
increased dryness offered some support to soybean prices in early
trading.
   Wheat prices dropped in the wake of the latest 6- to 10-day
National Weather Service forecast which calls for above-normal
precipitation in winter crop areas.
   Corn futures rose amid concern about the lagging planting pace
in some parts of the corn belt.
   Wheat settled { cent to 4{ cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in May at $4.18 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 2{ cents
higher with May at $2.80} a bushel; oats were a { cent lower to 2{
cents higher with May at $1.90{ a bushel; soybeans were 4} cents to
9} cents lower with May at $7.48 a bushel.
   Live hog prices were mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange due to a decline in supply, while live cattle prices were
mixed on expected news that fewer cattle arrived at feed lots last
month, said Tom Morgan, an analyst with Sterling Research Corp. in
Arlington Heights, Ill.
   ``Hog slaughter dropped as it normally does this time of year,''
he said. ``Prices go up with the decline in slaughters.''
   Live cattle settled .40 cent lower to .18 cent higher, with June
at 71.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .18
cent higher with May at 77.32 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to
.50 cent higher with June at 48.72 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .67 cent lower to .08 cent higher with May at 35.75
cents a pound.
   Energy futures were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange
amid concern that a one-day strike in Panama called for Wednesday
could disrupt oil shipments through the trans-Panamanian pipeline.
   A slight tightness in supplies of sweet crude oil, from which
gasoline is refined, contributed to a climb in crude prices, said
Jim Ritterbusch, an analyst with Carson Petroleum Co., a
Chicago-area oil distributor.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 11 cents lower to 42 cents
higher, with June at $20.52 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent to
.77 cent higher with June at 49.87 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .15 cent to .92 cent lower with June at 66.09 cents a
gallon.

<HEAD>Holly Farms Seeks Restraining Order in Chicken Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover target Holly Farms Corp. on
Monday sought to bar rival chicken producer Tyson Foods Inc. from
entering into an agreement with ConAgra Inc. that would restrain
the bidding for Holly.
   Holly Farms, which has agreed to merge with ConAgra, sought a
temporary restraining order against Tyson in Delaware Chancery
Court.
   Also Monday, Tyson extended its $63.50-a-share offer for Holly
Farms until Friday. The move followed a failed weekend effort to
settle the fight between Tyson of Springdale, Ark., and ConAgra of
Omaha, Neb., for Holly Farms.
   Tyson launched its bid for Holly Farms in October. The Memphis
company rejected the offer and instead reached its merger agreement
with ConAgra the following month.
   All three poultry companies are incorporated in Delaware and the
battle has since moved to that state's courts. Tyson is contesting
an agreement that gives ConAgra the right to buy some of Holly
Farm's more valuable assets if their merger is not consummated.
   Holly Farms said Monday it was concerned that its shareholders
would not be represented if Tyson and ConAgra reach an agreement to
settle the asset option issue.
   R.L. Taylor II, president and chief executive officer of Holly
Farms, asked the other two companies to not discuss the matter
without the consent of Holly Farm's board.
   ``Mr. Taylor said that neither Tyson nor ConAgra had responded
to the company's request. In view of this and indications ... that
such discussions might occur, the company felt compelled to seek
relief from the court,'' a statement from Holly Farms said Monday.
   ``The concern is that if they get together and settle this
between themselves without anybody representing the Holly
shareholders, Tyson might pay ConAgra something with the agreement
they would no longer bid on the company,'' said Rob Bowers, a
spokesman for Holly Farms.
   Tyson said that as of the close of business Friday, about 10.3
million shares of Holly Farms' outstanding 18.4 million common
shares had been tendered.

following through on its strong rally at the end of last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 24.19 to
2,463.89 on top of its 56.82-point jump Friday, establishing a new
post-crash high for the second straight session.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
927 up, 576 down and 491 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 179.35 million
shares, down from 221.49 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 212.53 million shares.
   Analysts said the surge on Friday prompted buying of stocks by
money managers at investing institutions who were fearful of
missing out on a continuing advance in stock prices.
   The catalyst for the market's latest advance came Friday in the
government's report of a smaller-than-expected 0.4 percent increase
in the producer price index of finished goods for April.
   That sent open-market interest rates tumbling, and increased
hopes that the Federal Reserve was succeeding in its effort to curb
inflation without pushing the economy into a recession.
   As the new trading week began, there was talk of more favorable
inflation news to come when the monthly data on the consumer price
index are issued on Thursday.
   Some analysts cautioned, however, that those hopes might not be
fulfilled. Wall Street estimates call for a CPI increase of
anywhere from 0.5 percent to 0.8 percent, after a rise of 0.5
percent in March.
   Hewlett-Packard led the active list, down 3} at 53] on turnover
of some 3.4 million shares. The company said its operating results
for the fiscal quarter ended April 30 fell short of analysts'
estimates.
   But the selling in that prominent stock did not spread to other
blue-chip and technology issues.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up 1\ at
52\; International Business Machines, up 2 at 112}; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up { at 34{, and General Motors, up ~ at 40}.
   Windmere plunged 4~ to 21]. The company posted earnings for its
latest fiscal quarter of 32 cents a share, down from 38 cents a
share in the comparable period a year earlier.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $17.35 billion, or
0.56 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.12 to 176.25.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.79 to 363.67, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.32 at 316.16.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.38 to 436.21. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 350.04, up 1.74.

   Three years ago, their states were economic powerhouses and
Govs. Michael Dukakis, Mario Cuomo, Thomas Kean and William O'Neill
seemed politically charmed.
   Now Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are
among nine states struggling to cope with budget deficits totaling
$5.6 billion, and their governors can be excused if they sometimes
feel hexed.
   While some fiscally conservative states in the Rust and Farm
belts have piled up big surpluses, these four prosperous
Northeastern states have emptied their pockets. So have Rhode
Island, West Virginia, Louisiana, Missouri and Arizona.
   The reasons vary, but all boil down to the same thing: The
states counted on billions of dollars of income that wasn't there.
And in some cases, they were victims of their own prosperity.
   ``When you get in those flush times and the revenue is flowing
in, there's a tendency for governors and legislators and regular
citizens to assume this will last forever,'' said Jim Verdier, who
lectures on state budget policy at Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government.
   It didn't last in Louisiana, where the oil boom went bust, or in
New York, where the stock market crashed, or in Massachusetts,
where the ``Massachusetts Miracle'' turned into a mirage.
   In West Virginia, bad times in the coalfields got worse and the
state treasurer was impeached for losing $279 million in bad
investments.
   In the Northeast especially, the seeds of the fiscal crisis were
planted in the federal Tax Reform Act of 1986.
   Among many other things, that act raised the tax on capital
gains _ profits earned from stock, real estate or other property.
   In most states, budget officials correctly assumed that many
people would immediately sell off assets that were subject to the
capital gains tax. Tax revenues would jump, but they would drop the
next year when fewer people declared capital gains.
   Other states guessed that there would be a much more gradual
sell-off. When tax revenues suddenly climbed in 1987, those states
didn't see the canyon that loomed ahead. Sure enough, revenues
plummeted the next year.
   ``It was like getting an extra paycheck one week and then not
getting one the next week,'' said Dall Forsythe, New York state's
budget director.
   The tax change particularly hurt wealthy Northeast states,
which, with their many rich investors, depend more heavily than
other states on the capital gains tax.
   New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, home to a lopsided share
of Fortune 500 companies and financial services workers, also were
especially hurt by the 1987 stock market crash.
   When planning began for fiscal 1989-90, governors and
legislators faced deficits of $2.6 billion in New York, $700
million in Connecticut and $500 million in New Jersey.
Massachusetts was about $250 million short; Rhode Island a modest
$5 million.
   Louisiana, determined not to raise taxes, faced a $700
million-plus deficit. West Virginia, one of the nation's poorest
states, was looking at a shortfall of about $400 million.
   A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in March left Missouri with a sudden
$192 million deficit. The ruling said that states cannot tax
federal retirees while exempting state pensioners.
   Arizona, whose tax base leans heavily on sales taxes, was hurt
by a nationwide slump in sales tax revenues, giving it a $250
million shortfall. Some blame the slump on a fear of recession that
prompted people to save more and spend less.
   Unlike the federal government, state governments generally
prohibit deficit spending. So the shortfalls must be covered,
either with more taxes or service cuts.
   New York adopted a program of cuts and increased taxes, but
Cuomo still estimates that the budget will fall $500 million short
by year's end. In New Jersey, Kean ordered a hiring freeze and
legislators are looking for programs to cut.
   Dukakis, his popularity in a nosedive, is still negotiating a
program of cuts and fee hikes in Massachusetts.
   Gov. Edward DiPrete bit into supposedly untouchable education
funds to help seal Rhode Island's fiscal gap.
   Connecticut, which has no personal income tax and the highest
per-capita income in the United States, is struggling to find a way
to close its gap. O'Neill, whose popularity also has sunk, has
proposed $737 million in new taxes, but the Legislature has been
unable to decide which taxes to raise.
   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton persuaded a special session
of the Legislature to raise taxes by $392 million, but legislators
decided they still need $15 million to $20 million.
   Arizona and Missouri legislators are still wrestling with their
budgets.
   Louisiana has perhaps the most intractable problems. Voters
rejected a referendum last month that would have raised personal
income taxes and the Legislature is forbidden by law from raising
taxes in any regular session in an odd-numbered year.
   ``The people of Louisiana seem completely unwilling to enact any
kind of tax increase,'' said Marcia Howard, the Denver-based
research director for the National Association of State Budget
Officers. ``It's mind-boggling in a sense; the state is really in
bad shape. I don't know what they're thinking.''
   On the other end of the spectrum are states such as Michigan,
which pulled through bad times in the late 1970s and early '80s and
now expects a $23.5 million budget surplus. Its simple presciption:
tax increases and budget cuts followed by conservative growth in
spending.
   ``We've learned that lesson for sure,'' said budget director
Shelby Solomon. ``It's very difficult to get the budget back into
balance once you lose control.''
   The Congress is a case in point.
   ``Everything they try to do is tainted or affected by that huge
deficit,'' Solomon said. ``Until you really have your financial
house in order, it's difficult to take a lot of positive action to
improve things and have government play a helpful role.''

<TEXT>
   Macmillan Inc., the publishing giant acquired
last year by Maxwell Communication Corp., said Monday it had agreed
to sell its Katherine Gibbs secretarial schools and its Technical
Schools Division for $31.5 million.
   Katherine Gibbs is one of the oldest secretarial training
programs in the United States. The technical schools division
provides training in areas such as diesel and auto mechanics and
electronics.
   The New York-based Macmillan said it agreed to sell them to
Phillips Colleges, based in Gulfport, Miss., which claims it is the
world's largest privately-held for-profit college system.
   With the the acquisition, Phillips Colleges said it will have 85
colleges in more than 24 states.
   London-based Maxwell acquired Macmillan, a publishing and
information services concern, for $2.5 billion after a bruising
takeover battle with a group that included Macmillan senior
management last year.
   ``Our association with Katharine Gibbs and our technical schools
over the years has been worthwhile and profitable, but our
corporate strategy demands that we sell all non-core businesses and
focus on publishing, information and language instruction,'' said
William F. Reilly, Macmillan president.
   Maxwell has previously agreed to sell its Michie Co. subsidiary
that publishes for the legal profession, for $226 million and its
BPCC unit, a British printing business, for $479 million.

   An Illinois family filed an $8.1 million
lawsuit against an Ohio-based baby stroller maker Monday, alleging
that a failed locking mechanism caused the stroller to collapse,
severing their daughter's finger.
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Dayton by Stanley
and Linda Baran of Schiller Park, Ill., against Evenflo Juvenile
Furniture Co. of Piqua, Ohio.
   Also named as a defendant was Evenflo's parent, Spalding &amp;
Evenflo Companies Inc. of Tampa, Fla.
   The Barans said their daughter, Lisa, then 4, was walking next
to a folding Evenflo stroller on Dec. 1, 1983, at a Chicago
shopping center when the stroller unexpectedly collapsed, severing
the tip of one of her fingers.
   The lawsuit alleges that Evenflo knew the stroller's locking
mechanism contained a serious defect. The Barans have asked for $8
million in punitive damages and $150,000 in compensatory damages.
   Robert Adikes, general counsel for Spalding &amp; Evenflo, declined
comment Monday, saying he had not seen the lawsuit.
   Telephone calls to the Evenflo office in Piqua went unanswered.

   Volkswagen United States announced Monday it

West German automaker hasn't done in two years.
   Spokesman Jay Amestoy said the company was shipping diesel
versions of the 1989 Volkswagen Jetta to dealers now.
   The rising cost of crude oil and a recent jump in gasoline
prices prompted the company to import the diesel versions of the
car, said Bill Young, vice president of the U.S. subsidiary.
   Volkswagen said the diesel Jetta would get about 36 mpg in the
city and 44 mpg on the highway, compared with mileage ratings of
its gasoline-powered versions of 25 mpg in the city and 34 mpg on
the highway.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which has 40
million phone charge cards, is investigating the possibility of
getting into the general credit card business, the company
confirmed Monday.
   The possibility of making some AT&amp;T Cards into general credit
cards ``is one of a number of options we are looking at to enhance
the AT&amp;T Card,'' AT&amp;T spokesman Daniel Coulter said.
   Coulter said the company has asked several financial
institutions to submit proposals for deals with AT&amp;T to provide new
service offerings, some of which involve the phone charge card.
   Under the concept, people who did not want a general credit card
from AT&amp;T could keep the plain phone charge card, Coulter said.
   The Wall Street Journal said Monday, quoting bank executives,
that AT&amp;T had reached an agreement with Total Systems Services
Inc., the nation's second-largest processor of credit card
transactions, to convert many of its phone charge cards to bank
credit cards.
   Total Systems, a data-processing subsidiary of CB&amp;T Bancshares
Inc., a Columbus, Ga.-based bank holding company, services 14
million Visa and MasterCard holders for other banks and 300,000
merchants in the United States.
   Coulter said no contracts had been signed with any party.
   Richard Ussery, president of Total Systems, declined to comment
Monday on the report.

<HEAD>Canada Will Add Ships and Trains to Fuel Inspection System</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada will inspect fuel imported by ships and
trains, as well as by tanker trucks, in its effort to stop
shipments of contaminated supplies, Environment Minister Lucien
Bouchard said Monday.
   Last week he announced the program for the inspection of tanker
trucks and limited the number of Canada-U.S.border crossings open
to those trucks to 31.
   The government acted following published reports that New York
and Canadian suppliers conspired to mix toxic wastes with fuel sold
in Ontario and Quebec.
   Bouchard said he has received the results of 91 laboratory tests
of fuel samples from tanker trucks and none showed evidence of
contamination.
   A senior Environment Department official said the tests
conducted so far were directed at detecting PCBs and not other
toxic chemicals such as solvents also mentioned in the allegations.
   He said samples from all inspections are being stored and they
will be further analysed as the inspection program is refined.
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, have been used in various
industrial processes and discharged as waste. They have been linked
to cancer and skin rashes.
   Jim Conrad, executive vice president of the Independent
Petroleum Marketers Association of Canada, has said the
government's inspection program would be more fair if it were
expanded to include tanker ships and trains.
   Bouchard said government employees have been told the Cabinet
must be kept better informed about allegations of potential
environmental hazards.
   ``We don't want to receive news like this from the deep bowels
of a department,'' he said. ``We want the information on our desk
now, immediately.''
   Bouchard and other Cabinet ministers have said that newspaper
reports last week provided the first word they received of the
possibility that contaminated fuel was being sold in Canada.
   Later, there were allegations that government authorities were
warned about the fuel scheme months and even years ago but failed
to take action.
   According to the allegations, toxic chemicals were mixed with
gasoline and diesel and heating fuel and sold to unsuspecting
customers.

   The U.S. dollar gained sharply against the Japanese
yen Tuesday morning, while stock prices rebounded on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 137.30 yen, up 0.50 yen from Monday's close
of 136.80 yen. The dollar reached its highest level since Nov. 2,
1987, when the currency opened at 137.70 yen. Traders said the rise
followed a similar trend in New York overnight, where the dollar
finished at 137.18 yen.
   ``The dollar in Tokyo is fundamentally bullish, and the majority
of market players are expecting the currency will easily reach the
140-yen level,'' said a trader with the Bank of Tokyo.
   He said the Bank of Japan intervened shortly after the market
opened, selling more than $100 million to halt the currency's rise.
   One trader said Japanese investors' demand for the dollar is
substantially stronger than that for the yen because of the
stability of the U.S. economy.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 150.04 points the
previous day, recouped 188.09 points to bounce back to 33,904.38
within the first 15 minutes of trading.
   Dealers said a 24.19-point overnight gain in the Dow Jones
industrial average in New York prompted the Nikkei's recovery.

   Early May sales of cars and trucks made by
U.S.-based companies dropped 8.2 percent compared with last year,
when consumers were flocking to showrooms before incentives
expired, the companies reported Monday.
   The eight major companies making vehicles in North America said
they sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 36,480
during the May 1-10 period this year, compared with a rate of
39,771 during the same time last year.
   Cars sold at a rate 9.8 percent lower than in early May last
year, and truck sales were down 5.3 percent.
   Incentives were in effect during both periods, but last year,
most of them expired on May 11. That spurred customers who had been
putting off buying a vehicle to head to showrooms.
   This year, Ford Motor Co.'s incentives expire May 31, General
Motors Corp.'s end June 5 and Chrysler Corp.'s continue
indefinitely. Consumers can select cash rebates or low-interest
financing on most models covered by the programs.
   ``The rebates are helping us,'' said Herb Adcox, owner of Herb
Adcox Chevrolet-Geo in Chattanooga, Tenn. ``Most of them are taking
the money, we're doing little or none on financing.''
   Joe Matts, new car sales manager at Jones-West Ford-Mitsubishi
in Reno, Nev., agreed.
   ``It's mostly cash,'' he said. ``Maybe one or two of 10 take
financing. ... If you compare it to last year, it's off, but that
was a very good year.''
   Through May 10 of this year, car and truck sales were running
4.1 percent behind the pace set last year, the second-best selling
year in automobile industry history.
   Car sales were 6.1 lower for the year and truck sales were off
0.5 percent.
   Of the nation's Big Three automakers, GM had the least decline
during the 10-day period.
   GM's early-May car sales fell 9.5 percent to an average daily
rate of 11,554 this year compared with a rate of 12,769 during the
period last year. GM's car sales through May 10 this year were 10.6
percent below last year's pace.
   GM's truck sales were up 6.1 percent in early May and down 0.5
percent for the year.
   Ford's car sales were off 11.1 percent to an average daily rate
of 6,695, compared with a rate of 7,534 during early May last year.
Its car sales for the year were running 0.8 percent behind last
year's pace.
   Ford's light truck sales during early May this year were 11.9
percent behind last year's rate and 3.6 percent lower than the
year-to-date rate last year.
   Chrysler's car sales dropped 14.6 percent to an average daily
rate of 3,290 this year, compared with a rate of 3,852 during the
early-May period last year. Car sales for the year at Chrysler were
16.8 percent behind last year's pace.
   Sales of Chrysler's light truck sales were down 9.3 percent for
the period but up 1.1 percent for the year.

<HEAD>Mexico Announces Liberalization of Foreign Investment Rules</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico announced a sweeping liberalization of
its rules on foreign investment Monday in hopes of attracting badly
needed capital to its debt-crippled economy.
   The new rules will open areas previously closed to outsiders and
raise the amount of foreign ownership permitted in others. In some
key areas, such as tourism, Mexico will for the first time allow
100 percent foreign ownership.
   Under Mexico's 1973 Foreign Investment Law, foreign ownership
has been limited to 49 percent in most industries.
   The announcement came as negotiations on restructing the $107.4
billion foreign debt were to resume in New York. Mexico's pledge to
modernize its protectionist economy are a crucial feature of the
debt talks.
   ``No country can modernize without attracting fresh
investment,'' Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche told a news
conference. ``The tendency in the world is moving toward
interdependence.''
   The new regulations, which take effect immediately, open up
previously closed areas such as telecommunications, auto parts,
fishing and secondary petrochemicals to 50 percent foreign
ownership.
   In tourism, a critical item on President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's economic development agenda, the 49 percent limit is
being abolished. Outsiders will now be allowed 100 percent
ownership.
   Serra Puche declared it ``historic'' that investors will now be
able to remit 100 percent of profits.
   Many areas deemed strategic such as banking, petroleum, mineral
exploration, electrical generation and broadcasting will remain
off-limits to foreigners, Puche said.
   Sierra Puche said the liberalization is aimed at generating
employment and modernizing the Mexican economy. He also said the
government plans to simplifying paperwork for investors.
   The Mexican economy has been battered by the debt and low oil
prices to the point of near zero-growth. Mexican officials say
foreign capital is essential to stimulating growth.
   The Commerce Department said that foreign investment totalled
$3.1 billion last year.
