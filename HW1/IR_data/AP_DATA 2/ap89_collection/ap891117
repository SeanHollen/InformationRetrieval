   Federal aid was approved Friday for
tornado-ravaged Huntsville, where 17 died and several hundred were
injured or lost their homes, and Gov. Guy Hunt toured hospitals and
visited with grieving families.
   ``I've been around a lot of tornadoes, but I've not seen the
type of damage on as broad a scale as I've seen this morning,''
Hunt said after a helicopter tour of the 10-mile-long path of
destruction.
   State emergency management officials estimated the damage in
excess of $100 million in the agency's letter to President Bush
requesting a disaster declaration, said Terry Abbott, the
governor's press secretary.
   ``I've never seen as much rubble from a tornado before,'' said
Danny Cooper, the state agency's director.
   He listed 119 houses destroyed, 125 with minor damage, and three
churches, two schools, 35 businesses and 10 public buildings either
destroyed or suffering heavy damage.
   Wind in the tornado was estimated at 250 mph when the twister
hit Wednesday afternoon.
   More than 400 people were injured, with about 80 still under
care in hospitals when Hunt visited patients' rooms Friday. City
officials said about 1,000 were left homeless.
   Hunt asked that flags around the state be lowered to half-staff
through Tuesday in memory of the victims, and Marilyn Quayle, wife
of the vice president, planned to visit the battered city Saturday.
   President Bush issued a disaster declaration Friday morning to
clear the way for tornado victims to receive federal relief. Cooper
said about $1 million may be needed in the form of individual and
family grants to provide clothing and temporary housing. The
federal government pays 75 percent of the cost and the state 25
percent.
   Grant Peterson, associate director of the federal Emergency
Management Agency, said Friday he hopes that offices can be opened
Sunday to take applications for disaster relief. He said assistance
checks may be in the mail within a week. FEMA's reaction time was
criticized after South Carolina was struck by a hurricane.
   Police spokesman Ronnie Fudge said several truckloads of food
had arrived but the city is running out of places to store the
goods. He urged that people donate money to relief agencies rather
than send food.
   Hunt visited privately Friday morning with families of some of
the 17 killed in the tornado,
   The victims ranged in age from 7 to 67. Two of the dead, John
and Wanda Lewis, were found holding each other beneath a table,
crushed by a collapsed ceiling at Gates Cleaners, where Lewis was
manager.
   Much of Westbury Mall was reduced to rubble by the tornado.
   ``To look at that building, it's hard to understand why more
people were not killed,'' Hunt said.
   Hunt also stopped at a school heavily damaged by the tornado. A
hole in one outside wall exposed a caved-in classroom. Because the
tornado struck at 4:30 p.m., most of the classrooms were empty and
only six children were injured.
   School personnel and painters in the building were credited with
helping protect about 30 youngsters in extended hours and
kindergarten day care programs. Some children were moved into a
closet for safety.
   ``There were a lot of heroes, or more people would have been
killed,'' said the governor.

   The General Assembly approved the Khmer
Rouge as part of an interim Cambodian government Thursday, but
Western nations split over the role of the brutal regime ousted by
a Vietnamese invasion 11 years ago.
   The resolution, passed 124-17 with 12 abstentions, noted
Vietnam's announcement that it had withdrawn all its troops from
Cambodia, but said the withdrawal was unverified and not part of an
overall political settlement.
   Voting against the resolution were Vietnam and its main ally,
the Soviet Union; the Soviet allies in Eastern Europe; Cuba;
Nicaragua, and Afghanistan.
   The United States, Britain, France, Canada and China supported
the measure, but Sweden and Finland changed their favorable votes
of last year and abstained to express abhorrence of the Khmer
Rouge. Other abstainers were Algeria, Congo, India, Iraq, Lebanon,
Madagascar, Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania and North Yemen.
   In the resolution ending its 11th annual debate on Cambodia, the
assembly said a transitional government of all factions should be
established under Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former Cambodian
ruler who now is a rebel leader, and internationally supervised
elections should follow.
   It said there must be no return ``the universally condemned
polices and practices of a recent past,'' a clear reference to
Khmer Rouge rule.
   General Assembly resolutions are not binding.
   The Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia in April 1975 and killed or
starved hundreds of thousands of people before the Vietnamese
invasion of December 1978. It now is the strongest of the three
guerrilla groups fighting the Hanoi-sponsored government.
   Vietnam reported near the end of September that all its soldiers
had been withrawn.
   Swedish delegate Lars Goran-Engfelt said in explaining his
abstention: ``Public opinion in Sweden and in other democratic
countries has strongly voiced its revulsion at the prospect of the
possible return of the Khmer Rouge. That is a healthy reaction
which my government can not and will not ignore.'' Many of the 59
speakers in the two-day debate denounced the current offensive of
the Khmer Rouge, who have captured the western provincial capital
of Pailin and are reported advancing on Cambodia's second-largest
city, Battambang.
   Last week, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Britain accepted
Vietnam's statement that all its soldiers had withdrawn and said
his government would send aid to Cambodia through private relief
agencies.
   The three-faction resistance alliance, led by Sihanouk, says
30,000 Vietnamese soldiers remained behind in Cambodian uniforms,
100,000 Vietnamese militiamen are in Cambodia and nearly 1 million
Vietnamese settlers have moved into the country.
   Western aid has been sent in the past only to Cambodian refugee
camps in Thailand, some of which are dominated by the Khmer Rouge,
which has been accused of appropriating the food and clothing for
its fighting units.
   Australia announced it will open trade relations with Vietnam,
breaking the U.S.-led embargo on trade and investment.
   The United Nations recognizes the resistance alliance as the
legitimate government of Cambodia. U.N. officials have drafted
plans for a peacekeeping force that would help safeguard civil
rights, verify the disarming of factions, monitor elections and
make sure the Khmer Rouge did not regain power.

   CBS' ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung'' is set
this weekend to air another reconstruction of a news story, using
actors to help tell it. But at both CBS and NBC, the technique
could prove the wave of the past.
   CBS News officials, whose low-rated Chung series has been hit by
criticism and even cartoon ridicule for re-creating news stories
with actors, may cut back such re-recreations or even drop them,
network sources say.
   ``They're back-pedalling,'' says a CBS executive who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Whether they cease to do re-enactments or
do fewer of them and are more selective is a subject of
discussion.''
   NBC News, which has used news re-creations in the first three of
its ``Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow'' specials, has also been
considering whether to end their use. On Thursday afternoon,
however, NBC said a re-creation segment would air in a YTT
broadcast set for Nov. 28.
   Tom Ross, senior vice president for news planning at NBC News,
says the network is satisfied that YTT's re-creations were accurate
and handled well. ``But ... we're re-evaluating the future of them
here,'' he says, declining to elaborate.
   Andrew Lack, executive producer of Chung's series, did not
return phone calls. CBS spokesman Tom Goodman declined to comment
when asked if the show's re-enactments are being scaled back or
eventually will be dropped.
   Several have been completed, though, and likely will be
broadcast. One is on the Three Mile Island nuclear plant accident.
   In Saturday's re-enactment, an actress plays a teen-age girl
trying to get an abortion. Two other actors also appear. So do
people who were involved in the real girl's real story, a spokesman
for the show says.
   This mix of the real and the re-enacted recently was lampooned
in a Jules Feiffer cartoon. It pictured a man watching CBS' show
and hearing that Pat Sajak plays Vice President Dan Quayle and that
Chung ``is played by Cher.''
   But the mix is no matter for mirth by news traditionalists like
former CBS News President Richard Salant. He says re-enactments
blur the line between news and entertainment and wouldn't be
permitted under guidelines he once drew up for CBS News, which he
left in 1979.
   ``Absolutely not,'' he says, adding that ``no news organization
has anything to go with except its credibility. If you start mixing
imagined fact with real fact, there goes your credibility.''
   Both the Chung show and NBC's YTT specials say their
re-enactments are clearly identified as such.
   But some viewer confusion seems to exist, according to a Los
Angeles Times poll taken in August, a month before Chung's show
premiered but after the Aug. 2 debut of the first of NBC's
``Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow'' specials.
   A majority of the 1,250 adults surveyed said they could not
evaluate the shows. But of those who felt they could, about 18
percent considered ``Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow'' to be news, with
14 percent thinking it entertainment.
   Twenty-six percent thought ABC's ``PrimeTime Live'' was a news
program, while 18 percent thought it was entertainment. That series
does not use re-enactments.
   Everette Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for
Media Studies says he's ``not particularly disturbed'' by the
re-enactments on Chung's show and on ``Yesterday, Today &amp;
Tomorrow.''
   If it's all right for New York Times reporters to say what
happened at a Cabinet meeting they didn't attend, he says, ``it's
all right for television to re-create scenes _ as long as they do
it with some fidelity to the truth and that there's verifiable
evidence that the event occurred.''
   But he denounces ``simulations'' such as the controversial one
in July on ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' which purported to
re-create the transfer to Soviet agents of secret documents by
American diplomat Felix S. Bloch.
   Bloch has not been charged with anything.
   ABC has publicly apologized for its July simulation, and in a
recent interview, ABC News president Roone Arledge called it ``an
aberration.''
   ``It was a violation of our policy,'' it never should have
happened, and ``the people involved have been reprimanded,'' he
says. He calls the simulation that aired the result of ``a carnival
of errors'' that occurred amid last-minute time pressures.
   The incident prompted a tightening of ABC News guidelines
covering news simulations or re-creations that may be allowed in a
news program ``in certain narrowly defined situations.''
   Their use must now be approved first by Arledge or his designee,
as well as the broadcast's executive producer.
   But ABC News, he says, won't do any series where news
re-enactments are part of the routine.
   Why not?
   ``I don't really want to get into a big hassle with the other
people,'' he says. ``But ABC News just feels that this is not what
we want to do.
   ``There is a line between news and entertainment, and no matter
how blurred it becomes on occasions, how difficult it is in the
overall environment of television to maintain, we believe there is
that line, and we have our own idea of where that is.''

   People who stopped buying apple juice
because of the Alar chemical scare apparently are buying more
orange juice, according to a national survey.
   Apple juice sales were down 14 percent to 146 million gallons in
American supermarkets in the first nine months of 1989, a spokesman
for A.C. Nielsen Co. told the Florida Citrus Commission on
Wednesday. The drop in revenue was 9 percent to $430 million over
the same period a year ago.
   By contrast, supermarket orange juice sales in the same period
were up 5 percent to 512 million gallons and up 7 percent in value
to $1.9 billion, said Mike Miller, a Nielsen vice president.
   Alar is the trade name for a spray that keeps apples red and
fresh longer. A widely publicized consumer report in February
linked Alar to a long-term health threat. The spray is not used on
citrus.
   Apple growers have dropped use of the chemical, and federal
health officials have tried to reassure consumers about the safety
of apples.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday approved a subpoena
that would compel former President Reagan to produce some of his
records by next Wednesday for the Iran-Contra criminal case of John
Poindexter.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene granted a petition by
lawyers for Poindexter, who was Reagan's national security adviser.
In the past, the lawyers have said they want portions of Reagan's
diaries and notes he took at key meetings with Poindexter.
   The judge did not say how narrowly or broadly drawn the subpoena
was.
   In a two-paragraph order, Greene said Poindexter ``may serve
upon former President Reagan and upon the archivist of the United
States the subpoenas ... submitted to the court.
   ``The return date for those subpoenas shall be Nov. 22, 1989,''
said Greene.
   The judge ruled last month that Poindexter is entitled to
subpoena ``specific, relevant documents'' bearing on the criminal
charges against him.
   ``I have no comment,'' Theodore Olson, a lawyer for the former
president, said in response to Greene's order.
   Reagan's lawyers could file a motion to quash the subpoena.
   Responding to shouted questions as he was entering a limousine
in Cincinnati, the former president replied: ``Cases like that
before the law, I don't comment.''
   Poindexter, who is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 22, is under
indictment on two counts of making false statements to Congress,
two counts of obstruction of Congress and one count of conspiracy.
   This is the first time in the Iran-Contra scandal that a judge
has approved a subpoena for documents from Reagan. Earlier this
year, U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell had quashed a
subpoena for documents sought from Reagan in the case against
Oliver North.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said ``we are in the
process of reviewing'' Greene's order ``to determine what action we
should take, if any.''
   The department will examine the Reagan subpoena in light of the
1974 Supreme Court ruling on the Watergate tapes, said a Justice
Department source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   During the Watergate scandal, the court ruled that President
Nixon had to comply with a subpoena from the special prosecutor to
produce tape recordings of 64 conversations. The court ruled that
need for the evidence in a criminal case outweighed the president's
rights in the matter.
   To date, the only information supplied from Reagan's diary or
notes in the Iran-Contra affair were portions of the diary shown to
the staff of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. Walsh's staff was
allowed to see the diary portions and take notes on them after they
were reviewed by White House legal counsel and deemed to be
sufficiently relevant to allow investigators to examine them.
   Poindexter, in support of his request, said he met ``daily,
frequently alone'' with the president during the Iran-Contra affair.
   The two men, according to Poindexter, talked of the role of
Richard Secord as a middleman in the transfer of arms to Iran and
also discussed the accuracy of a chronology prepared by North and
reviewed by Poindexter.
   Poindexter now is accused of lying to Congress in connection
with the chronology.
   The chronology said that no official in the U.S. government
learned before January 1986 that Hawk missiles had been shipped to
Iran in November 1985 with assistance from the CIA.
   The shipment, overseen by North, who kept Poindexter apprised of
its progress, occurred without the existence of a presidential
finding as required by law. Reagan signed a retroactive finding the
month after the Hawks were transported to Iran.
   Poindexter has made Reagan central to his defense by suggesting
that the president personally authorized the alleged criminal
activities of which he stands accused.
   For example, Poindexter said that Reagan took notes of
discussions focusing on how to respond to congressional inquiries
about whether the administration was secretly assisting the Contras
during a congressional ban on the use of appropriations by
intelliegence agencies to aid the rebels.
   ``We believe the president's notes will show (that he held)
discussions with Admiral Poindexter, first about letters that were
sent by Congress and the appropriateness of any response,'' one of
Poindexter's lawyers said in September.
   Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congress by denying that
the administration was aiding the Contras.

   East Germans have won the right to
travel across borders that once imprisoned them, but learning and
building democracy in their homeland could be a complex task.
   Now the influence wielded by popular revolt has to be
transformed into a movement that can make decisions and exercise
power.
   New Forum, the largest opposition group, is only 2 months old.
Other movements, such as the Social Democratic Party and Democracy
Now, are even younger.
   They are hampered by lack of office space, telephones and other
essentials for building an organization capable of matching the
powerful apparatus of the Communist Party.
   Although demoralized, the Communists still have tens of
thousands of powerful positions, privileges and a vast media
network at their disposal.
   Unlike the Social Democrats, who are attracting middle-aged East
Germans hoping to make careers in an organized party, New Forum
runs on a theory of ``grass-roots democracy'' that leaves it
somewhere between a political movement and a potential party in
Parliament.
   That is confusing for people who for 40 years have seen politics
as a sham in which they have no genuine say. They expect New Forum
_ the only recognizable force in the astounding popular revolt of
the past month _ to oust the Communist Party.
   The confusion was evident at a meeting this week of some 120
members of the central Leipzig branch of New Forum.
   Seated in the pews of a city church, an audience with an average
age of about 25 asked questions with restraint and discipline
rarely seen in Western political debates.
   Should Communist Party members be allowed to work with New
Forum? Will New Forum contest the promised free elections? What is
the movement's program?
   The energetic leaders of Leipzig's New Forum, far better
organized in factories, institutes and outlying suburbs than their
fellow activists in East Berlin, patiently tried to outline plans.
   ``Of course,'' pastor Martin Kind explained, ``we would attract
members if we produced a program now. But we must take the more
tiring task of trying to politicize each individual. ... People
must learn what they don't know yet.''
   New Forum plans to do this by forming ``Basisgruppen'' _ or
basic groups _ in neighborhoods and workplaces and ``theme groups''
to tackle issues such as ecology or East Germany's strained public
health system.
   Each district group will elect people who in turn will nominate
members of a citywide group that will send members to New Forum's
national bodies.
   The structure is aimed at making East Germans politically aware
and active.
   West Germany's Greens, who sent members to Leipzig and Berlin
this week to talk with New Forum, evolved along similar lines. The
Greens wield more influence than pure power, and New Forum hopes to
do the same.
   Fine and good, said a woman pensioner, but what about
organization? She cycled clear across Leipzig last weekend in
search of a supposed New Forum meeting.
   Other New Forum members complained that Communists, seeking to
establish credentials as reformers by talking to the opposition,
sometimes announced a ``dialogue'' without telling New Forum.
   New Forum, the Social Democrats and others have a tough task to
keep the revolt peaceful and to build a democracy in a climate in
which politics is discredited.
   But many East Germans reckon that now is the best chance they
will ever have to transform communism into a working democracy.
   ``If we don't succeed this time,'' Kind told a Western reporter
during a meeting break, ``then we'll never make it. They can send
us all to Siberia and rule as they please.''

<HEAD>Mosbacher Sets Conditions for Soviet Trade Privileges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is nearing final passage of
historic legislation establishing the right to travel, but U.S.
trade barriers will give way only gradually.
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said Thursday the Soviet
travel legislation will not lead to an immediate dismantling of
tariffs erected by Congress 15 years ago in behalf of Soviet Jews.
   He said the Soviets, at best, would get only a year-to-year
waiver while restrictions on trade credits would remain in place.
   ``We'll review it to see if it is sufficient,'' Mosbacher said
of the Soviet legislation that is expected to clear its final
hurdle by December. ``We can't prejudge that.''
   He did not spell out the U.S. conditions at a joint news
conference with Konstantin F. Katushev, the Soviet minister of
foreign economic affairs. But he said the process could take ``a
lot longer'' than his initial guess of one to three months.
   Besides, Mosbacher said, a new trade agreement with the Soviet
Union would have to be negotiated first. The last accord was
nullified by Moscow in 1975 in retaliation for the erection of
tariff barriers to Soviet goods a year earlier.
   Mosbacher and Katushev signed commercial agreements designed to
boost U.S. investment in the Soviet Union and to launch
negotiations on a new tax treaty. Also, they set up a working group
to consider a new trade agreement ``on a preliminary basis,''
Mosbacher said.
   But, he added: ``We want to make clear that we are not beginning
negotiation of a trade agreement. This can come only after the
Soviets codify their emigration legislation and after a waiver
under the Jackson-Vanik amendment becomes possible.''
   The legislation imposed tariffs against Soviet goods that are
not applied to the exports of most other countries. The restriction
on trade credits, known as the Stevenson amendment, was adopted in
a parallel move by Congress.
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who has pushed for wider Jewish
emigration, said in a statement: ``The Soviet Union is making real
progress. But going all the way toward granting most-favored nation
(MFN) status strikes me as premature.
   ``There are several issues that need to be cleaned up. There are
600 long-term `refuseniks' who should be freed before we extend the
carrot of MFN.''
   The National Conferece on Soviet Jewry said, meanwhile, in a
statement: ``We welcome the initiative by the Soviet government in
bringing before the Supreme Soviet a draft law providing for
freedom of entry and exit.''
   The conference lists 51,336 Jews as emigrating from the Soviet
Union by the end of October. The exodus surpasses the all-time high
of 51,320 reached in 1979.
   Anticipating U.S. action to facilitate trade, Soviet Ambassador
Yuri V. Dubinin told reporters at the Soviet embassy: ``We are
expecting some positive steps from the U.S. side.'' He called the
Soviet legislation a breakthrough and evidence of ``new thinking.''
   The legislation establishes the right of all Soviet citizens to
travel abroad _ permanently or on visits _ and reduces or
eliminates most restrictions in effect now.
   ``The Soviet Union measures its words with deeds,'' Dubinin said
as he detailed some of the major provisions, and Moscow's
expectation of a positive U.S. response.
   Dubinin linked the legislation, which is bound to accelerate an
already quickening pace of Jewish, ethnic German, Armenian and
Pentecostal emigration, to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's effort
to restructure the Soviet economy.
   Two-way trade now amounts to about $3 billion. American grain
sales to the Soviet Union account for about $2 billion.
   By contrast, Soviet trade with West Germany is nearly $7.6
billion a year and with Finland, a much smaller country, $6 billion
annually.
   Katushev said American businesses were eager to invest in the
Soviet Union and were seeking ``a favorable approach'' from the
Bush administration.
   ``We have no prejudices at all to selling to America,'' he said
through a Russian translator. ``We would like to see American women
in Soviet furs.''

<HEAD>Walesa: Better to Tickle the Russian Bear Than Pull its Moustache</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa sums up his
philosophy in dealing with the Russians in a line: ``There is no
point in pulling the bear by its moustache.''
   Pausing to let a gentle wave of laughter subside among his
American listeners, he then said with the finesse of a professional
comedian, ``It is better to tickle him.''
   His audience, a group of experts on the Soviet Bloc, erupted in
laughter.
   Walesa, whose walrus moustache, twinkling eyes and beak-like
nose are familiar to American audiences, showed many faces during
his triumphant visit to Washington this week, and in this city of
politics, he cemented his place as one of the premier politicians
of the 1980s.
   Asked why he had turned down the offer to become the first
Solidarity prime minister _ an honor he bestowed on his adviser
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Walesa acknowledged: ``I'd like to be prime
minister. That way, wherever I went, they would play the national
anthem.
   ``But to have a prime minister who was chairman of a trade
union? That would be worse than communism,'' he said.
   When Walesa addressed the AFL-CIO convention, he was the
consummate trade union leader. He even taped a television
advertisement for the labor federation, closing with the slogan, in
English, ``Union, yes.''
   When he spoke to Congress, he was a Polish statesman, invoking
geopolitical imagery that Housing Secretary Jack Kemp likened to
that of Winston Churchill, the fiery orator who led Britain during
World War II.
   Those speeches were carefully crafted by Walesa's team of
advisers, and like all his remarks in Washington, delivered through
an interpreter.
   But a few times he threw away the text and showed off the cagey
wit and graphic imagery that enabled him to lead the strike that
forged Solidarity in 1980, steer the banned union through martial
law and create the first non-communist government in the Soviet
bloc.
   ``He's a real politician,'' said an admiring Zbigniew
Brzezinski, who was President Carter's national security adviser.
He shared the dais with Walesa at a conference sponsored by Radio
Liberty and Radio Free Europe, the U.S.-financed radio stations
that have broadcast to the Soviet Bloc since the depths of the Cold
War.
   Addressing the experts on Eastern Europe, Walesa showed a far
more relaxed and more nimble persona than while speaking before a
joint meeting of Congress or at the AFL-CIO convention.
   Walesa, a regular Radio Free Europe listener, was asked whether
the station had influenced him.
   ``The degree cannot be measured. Would there be land and earth
without the sun?'' he said, to a very grateful audience.
   Walesa, who in his darkest days received unswerving support from
Polish-born Pope John Paul II, not only attended Mass every morning
of his stay in Washington, he genuflected to the church in his
public remarks.
   Asked how he liked dealing with his former adversaries, the
communists, Walesa responded: ``Of course, I am a good Christian,
as you know. Therefore, I forgive.
   ``And secondly, if there were no adversaries, I wouldn't exist,
as well. Ladies and gentlemen, if I lived in a normal, civilized
country, I ... would never get a Nobel Prize. So I have gained
something because of other people's stupidity,'' he said, invoking
laughter and then applause.
   His wit can be acerbic. To convey his displeasure at the level
of aid that Canada has offered Poland, Walesa said: ``If things
keep going at this rate, they will give us a beautiful necktie _
but we can only wear it in the coffin.''
   Walesa was asked what he would say to Gorbachev if they met.
   ``Dzien dobry,'' a friendly Polish greeting which is very close
to the Russian phrase for ``good day,'' he said without missing a
beat.
   ``I'd ask him what language we should speak,'' said Walesa,
again drawing laughter.
   ``I do have a lot to say to Mr. Gorbachev,'' Walesa said,
weaving between gravity and humor. ``Such a conference would be
prepared beforehand by specialists and we would only move our lips.
   ``I do understand the terrible problems that Gorbachev has,'' he
said. ``He is like a juggler who has a hundred balls in the air,
and somehow he is catching all of them,'' said Walesa, making a
juggling motion.
   ``Fantastic,'' he laughed, using the English word.
   ``We shouldn't show off. We should solve problems,'' he said,
leaving his audience to guess whether he was praising or
criticizing the Soviet leader, a technique Walesa perfected in the
days when a wrong word to could send him to jail.

<HEAD>Number of Injuries Up Sharply; Improved Reporting a Factor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American workplaces reported a sharp rise in
the number of injuries and illnesses last year _ particularly
illnesses attributed to repetitive motion disorders, according to
the Labor Department.
   Department and labor union analysts said the reported jump in
injuries and illnesses from 6 million in 1987 to 6.4 million last
year can be at least partly attributed to improved reporting by
employers.
   About 3,300 workplace deaths were reported by the department's
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which said it considered that number to
be very conservative because of the limited scope of its fatality
data.
   Margaret Seminario, the AFL-CIO's associate safety director,
said Thursday that improved reporting stems from more aggressive
enforcement of reporting requirements by the Labor Department's
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   ``OSHA's heavy hand has employers more thoroughly reporting
data,'' Seminario said.
   Still, she said that even considering the impact of improved
reporting, the data still indicated that safety problems in
American workplaces were getting worse.
   The Labor Department said the reported increases last year
brought the rate of injuries and illnesses to 8.6 for every 100
full-time workers, up from 8.3 in 1987. The number of incidents
that resulted in lost work days rose to four for every 100 workers
in 1988, up from 3.8 in 1987.
   The number of reported injuries and illnesses was up in every
sector of the economy, with more than 200,000 of the increase
coming in manufacturing, which reported 2.46 million on-the-job
injuries and illnesses last year.
   The highest incidence of injuries came in automobile
manufacturing, where 19.5 injuries were reported for every 100
full-time workers last year.
   Of 240,000 illnesses reported by employers for 1988, 115,400 _
48 percent _ were associated with repeated trauma, the department's
term for illnesses blamed on repetitive motion.
   The number of reported cases in that category was up 58 percent,
a factor interpreted by analysts as evidence that repetitive motion
problems are being more clearly identified in manufacturing,
meatpacking, construction and other sectors of the economy where
they are most common.

<HEAD>Vaccine Works on Mice; Human Version Years Away</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists at the National Institutes of
Health say they hope laboratory experiments on mice may point the
way toward development of a long-acting contraceptive vaccine for
women.
   The researchers reported Thursday that a vaccine developed using
genetic engineering techniques produces contraception for up to
nine months in female mice.
   The contraceptive vaccine works by preventing fertilization of
eggs by sperm, rather than by interfering with development of the
fetus after conception or inducing abortions.
   Findings from the research were published in Science, the
journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Asked how long it will be before the work may lead to
development of a human contraceptive vaccine, researcher Jurrien
Dean said: ``Well in excess of a decade, but that's just
speculation.''
   In the meantime, he said: ``I think that it has potential
application probably in veterinary medicine and agriculture. But
our main hope, as basic scientists, is that these studies will
stimulate investigations into these types of immunologically based
contraceptive agents.''
   The researchers focused their attention on the zona pellucida, a
layer of proteins surrounding egg cells produced by the ovaries in
all female mammals. One of the proteins serves as the receptor for
the male sperm cell when fertilization occurs.
   Previous studies at NIH and elsewhere had shown that if the zona
pellucida is coated with certain antibodies _ proteins that produce
specific immune system reactions _ injected into test animals, then
sperm cannot fertilize the egg.
   In the new research, scientists used genetic engineering methods
to precisely identify the zona pellucida's molecular binding site _
a small protein known as a peptide _ for a fertilization-blocking
antibody.
   A synthetic version of the binding-site peptide then was made in
the laboratory and used to vaccinate female mice. After being
vaccinated with the peptide, the mice produced their own antibodies
serving to prevent fertilization.
   This contraceptive effect lasted up to 36 weeks in the mice used
in the NIH experiments.
   Dean said it was significant that ``this very precise (genetic)
engineering provokes a specific, focused antibody response to just
a small part of the zona protein. We believe that this may be
important in avoiding any side effects such as damage to the ovary
or to other organs.''
   Identifying the antibody binding site involved cloning the
particular genes, or segments of genetic material, which control
formation of the zona pellucida protein.
   ``It turns out that the zona genes are conserved among
mammals,'' Dean said in an interview. ``That means that very
similar genes are present in dogs, cats, cows, rats _ any mammal
you pick, including humans. And therefore, if we can work out the
strategy in a model system like mice, we might be able to transfer
those observations to other animals.''
   The mouse experiments were conducted by a six-member team led by
Sarah E. Millar of NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Dean is also affiliated with that
institute.

   Armed men killed and mutilated
six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter Thursday
after bursting into their house at a leading university. A priest
quoted witnesses as saying government forces were involved.
   The government denied responsibility and condemned the slayings
as ``savage and irrational.''
   President Alfredo Cristiani told reporters at a news conference
that he had ordered an investigation. ``The killers will jeopardize
further the critical situation in our country,'' he said.
   The U.S. National Council of Churches also denounced the
slayings, and the U.S. ambassador said the slayings would have a
``negative impact'' on Cristiani's rightist government.
   Two witnesses said about 30 uniformed police or army soldiers
entered the campus before dawn and killed the eight ``with lavish
barbarity,'' said the Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit order
leader for Central America. ``For example, they (the troops) took
out their brains.''
   Late Thursday, uniformed security officers raided a downtown
office of the Lutheran Church and arrested 12 foreigners, including
four U.S. citizens, who work with the church, said Michel Gagne, a
consular officer in the Canadian Embassy. Gagne said the 12 were
detained by the Treasury Police, but the police would not confirm
the report.
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas compared the
killings to the slaying of his predecessor, Oscar Arnulfo Romero.
That 1980 assassination marked the beginning of years of killings
and kidnappings by right-wing death squads.
   ``If this spiral of violence continues, death and destruction
will sweep away many, especially those who are of most use to our
people,'' said Rivera Damas after leading a prayer over the
mutilated bodies.
   The slayings came on the sixth day of fierce combat around this
capital following an attack by guerrillas of the leftist Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
   The dead included Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of Jose Simeon Canas
Central American University, and vice-rector Ignacio Martin-Baro,
the country's leading expert on polls and polling procedures. The
other dead priests, all educators, were Segundo Montes, Amado
Lopez, Juan Ramon Moreno and Joaquin Lopez Lopez.
   Their housekeeper, Julia Elba Ramos, and her 15-year-old
daughter Celina, also were killed, said Tojeira.
   ``They did not want to leave witnesses,'' said Eduardo Valdez,
director of Jesuit studies at the university.
   The educators had received death threats since the heaviest
fighting of the 10-year-old war began Saturday, and callers to
radio talk shows had vehemently chastised Jesuits as subversives
and demanded their expulsion or punishment.
   The extreme right has for more than a decade accused local
Jesuits and their university of fostering subversive ideology.
   Rivera Damas said those who killed the priests ``were motivated
by the same hate that snuffed out the life of Monsignor Romero.''
   Romero was killed by a sniper while saying Mass on March 24,
1980. Former President Jose Napoleon Duarte blamed extreme
rightists for that murder and accused rightist ideologue Roberto
D'Aubuisson of masterminding the assassination.
   D'Aubuisson, a legislator and honorary president of Cristiani's
Arena party, has been accused of ties to death squads. Arena
opponents, including the FMLN, have said frequently that they
feared a resurgence of death squads since Cristiani took over from
Duarte on June 1.
   In a communique, the government's National Information Center
said the crime ``is intended to destabilize the democratic process
and increase even more the climate of anguish created by the FMLN.''
   The government and armed forces, which denied that troops or
police were involved, said the killings would be investigated.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler said
the U.S. ambassador would ask the Salvadoran government Thursday
for ``a full inquiry into this horrendous act.''
   The ambassador, William Walker, called the slayings ``a barbaric
act that has not only brought shame to El Salvador but will leave a
gaping hole in this country's intellectual and academic community.''
   Walker compared the killings to the Dec. 2, 1980, slayings by
troops of U.S. Maryknoll nuns Ita Ford and Maura Clarke, Ursuline
sister Dorothy Kazel and lay worker Jean Donovan.
   ``It is obviously going to have a negative impact on the
government of El Salvador,'' said Walker.
   He said he did not know anything about the report that
government troops were involved.
   The United States has supported a succession of governments in
the civil war against the FMLN. The fighting has taken more than
70,000 lives and cost $4 billion in military and economic aid this
decade.
   Lopez Lopez was a native Salvadoran; Ellacuria and the others
were Spaniards who had become naturalized citizens.
   Valdez said the Jesuit slayings occurred about 3 a.m., three
hours before the end of a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the city. He said
neighbors reported hearing gunshots, but thought that it was part
of the general fighting.
   Tojeira said the witnesses had been staying in another part of
the building and hid while the killings took place. It was a
miracle they weren't discovered and murdered, Tojeira said.
   He said the terrified witnesses had gone into hiding, did not
want to speak with reporters and did not trust authorities because
troops were implicated in the killings.
   Another priest, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
soldiers had been posted outside the house since Sunday and raided
and searched it Tuesday.
   He said the soldiers had demanded to know who slept in each of
the bedrooms from which the victims were later roused and murdered.
   Four of the victims had been dragged through the residence and
deposited in the yard outside. Trails of blood indicated they had
been wounded and might still have been alive while being dragged.
   In Rome, the headquarters of the Jesuit order condemned ``this
barbarous violence that has claimed so many other victims among the
people of Salvador.''

<HEAD>Senate Ethics Committee Looking Into HUD Allegation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee is reviewing
allegations that Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., violated rules in
the Department of Housing and Urban development scandal, a source
says, but there is no indication of a formal investigation.
   The ethics panel can check into allegations at an early stage
before even starting a preliminary inquiry, said the source,
speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity.
   When a complaint is filed _ one was submitted by the senator's
former opponent _ the staff begins to look into the allegations.
The Ethics Committee then must decide whether to proceed to the
first formal stage, a preliminary inquiry.
   D'Amato's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said in New York, ``We
haven't been told anything'' about the inquiry, which was first
reported on the CBS Evening News.
   Referring to the CBS report, she said: ``That doesn't mean
squat. They're obligated under the law to investigate anything
that's filed with the ethics committee.''
   The New York Times said in today's editions the committee had
decided to hire prominent Washington attorney Robert S. Bennett for
the D'Amato case and for another investigation of the involvement
of five senators with a failing savings and loan.
   Bennett earlier this year was selected by the committee to
investigate accusations that Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn.,
laundered $100,000 in campaign contributions through a book
contract.
   Last summer Mark Green, who ran against D'Amato in 1986, filed a
complaint against him with the Senate Ethics Committee, saying
there was ``substantial evidence'' that D'Amato broke Senate rules
and federal law. Green cited news reports of D'Amato's involvement
in the Wedtech scandal and influence-peddling at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development.
   D'Amato reportedly has been involved in lobbying HUD on behalf
of projects in New York and Puerto Rico, including winning a $1
million government grant to build a swimming pool in Island Park,
N.Y., a middle-class beachfront community. The village since has
decided to kill that project and give back the money.
   Green's complaint also cited other alleged improprieties going
back to the early 1970s, but D'Amato denounced Green's complaint as
politically motivated.
   A figure in the Wedtech case testified in court that he made an
illegal $30,000 contribution to D'Amato's re-election campaign, but
the senator denied it.
   Green, who has said in the past that the committee confirmed to
him receipt of his complaint, said Thursday night, ``I have gotten
no official notice from the committee whatsoever.''

<HEAD>Study Looks at Problems of Farm Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report by the Agriculture Department says
the financial crunch of the early 1980s in which many farmers were
forced from the land produced fewer lasting problems than were
predicted at the time.
   But the consequences of ``involuntary exits'' from farming
because of financial failure have been varied and are difficult to
fit into a single pattern, according to the department's Economic
Research Service report.
   ``The consequences of farm loss have been somewhat less negative
than early press reports, although interviews reveal the anguish of
farm loss,'' the report said. ``Many former operators retained all
or some of their farmland property.''
   It added: ``Nearly all found other jobs, most remained in their
home counties, and a sharp rise in disposable family income was
common. However, many retained high debt loads and tax liabilities
from their farm operations.''
   The USDA analysis was based on independent case studies of
``farm exit'' in all or parts of Wisconsin, Texas, North Dakota and
Georgia.
   Research in those areas was conducted or supported by land-grant
universities, along with other state and federal agencies,
sometimes with the financial support of private foundations.
   In most cases, the studies covered 1981 to 1987, although some
were for shorter periods within that time frame.
   The USDA analysis of the research studies noted that ``the farm
crisis of the 1980s was forecast to hit medium-sized family farms
the hardest, but the data ... show considerable variation from one
study to the next, cautioning against simple conclusions about the
fate of family farms.''
   Further, the report said there are ``serious concerns about the
financial state of many farmers'' who have been able to keep
operating, suggesting that the process of going broke is often
complex and slow.
   ``Farmers cut off from further credit did not necessarily cease
production immediately, but continued operating with funds from
off-farm income, short-term credit from suppliers and personal
loans,'' the report said. ``Some farmers have stayed in operation
despite non-payment of debt for five years or more and may face
foreclosure in the future.''
   The study showed that between 2 percent and 3.4 percent of the
surveyed farmers ``involuntarily left farming annually'' during the
early 1980s.
   Not counting farmers who died, the annualized rate of
involuntary, voluntary and total exits from farming in the surveyed
areas included:
   _Wisconsin, 529 farmers sampled in the eight southwestern
counties of Buffalo, Crawford, La Crosse, Jackson, Monroe,
Richland, Trempealeau and Vernon; 1.98 percent involuntary exit per
year, 3.26 percent voluntary, 5.24 percent total.
   _Texas, 960 sampled; 3.4 percent involuntary exit per year, no
data for voluntary, 3.4 percent total.
   _North Dakota, 624 sampled, 3.05 percent involuntary exit per
year; no data for voluntary, 3.05 percent total.
   _Georgia, Dodge County, 2.81 percent involuntary exit per year;
1.82 percent voluntary, 4.63 percent total.

   The Agriculture Department says the value of
U.S. dairy, livestock and poultry exports in the first half of 1989
was more than $3.6 billion, up 14 percent from the same six months
of 1988.
   Beef, pork, animal hair, live animals, leather and poultry meats
contributed to the increase, the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service said Thursday in a report.
   Animal fats, hides and skins were down slightly, the report
said. Both quantity and value of variety meats were down slightly
from a year earlier, due mostly to a sharp drop in shipments of
pork variety meats.
   In the category of dairy products, cheese and non-fat dry milk
declined 40 percent to 50 percent both in volume and value, the
report said. Butter exports nearly doubled in volume from a year
earlier, however, and were up more than 80 percent in value.
   Overall, the agency said 1989 export value of dairy, livestock
and poultry commodities are expected to rise 9 percent from
calendar 1988, led by meat and meat products, particularly beef and
pork.
   Exports of beef and veal during the first six months of this
year were 178,473 metric tons, up 85 percent from a year earlier,
the report said. The value of those shipments was put at $730.7
million, up 64 percent.
   The top market was Japan, 121,308 tons valued at $527.8 million,
up 71 percent and 56 percent, respectively. The sales to Japan
accounted for 68 percent of the total beef and veal export volume
and 72 percent of its value.
   Other top markets for U.S. beef and veal included Canada,
Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, the Bahamas, Hong Kong, European
Economic Community, Singapore and the Netherlands Antilles.

   Pregnant sheep and goats that nibble on
certain poisonous weeds risk harming their unborn offspring.
   Researchers at the Agriculture Department's poisonous plant
laboratory in Logan, Utah, are using sonograms _ the same kind of
machine used to check on human fetuses _ to prove their point.
   The department's Agricultural Research Service said Thursday
that sonograms show that poisons from certain plants eaten by the
pregnant animals cause deformities in their developing offspring by
restricting movements in the womb.
   Kip E. Panter, an agency animal scientist at the Logan facility,
said sonograms helped determine for the first time that a fetus
prevented from moving for three or four days at critical times may
develop a cleft palate. If restricted for 10 to 15 days, the
skeleton will be deformed.
   Range weeds hazardous to the health of unborn sheep and goats
include lupine, poison hemlock and wild forms of tobacco, he said.

<HEAD>Auditors Question Practice of Reimbursing Contractors for Fines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department's practice of paying all
fines incurred by private companies that run its nuclear weapons
plants is undermining efforts to improve environmental conditions
at the sites, federal auditors said today.
   In a report to Congress, the General Accounting Office said the
department shields the contractors from all financial liability for
violations of state and federal environmental laws. Even the
companies' related legal bills are paid.
   By contrast, the Defense Department makes its contractors pay
such fines, the auditors said.
   ``If DOE continues its current policy and practice ... we
believe DOE will reduce contractors' incentives to comply'' with
hazardous waste regulations ``and may negate the benefits'' of the
Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to enforce its rules at
these federal facilities, the audit report concluded.
   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said the report highlighted a serious
flaw in Energy Department policy.
   ``DOE has disavowed a vital tool for ensuring that its weapons
plants comply with the environmental laws _ the basic premise that
the polluter pays,'' Luken said.
   Luken is chairman of the House Energy subcommittee on
transportation and hazardous materials, which was holding a hearing
today on the GAO report and a bill sponsored by Rep. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., that would prohibit the government from reimbursing
contractors if they are at fault for drawing environmental fines or
penalties.
   The department's inspector general earlier this year reported on
the practice of reimbursing contractors for their fines, and the
department has told Congress it is considering changing the
contracts to limit such reimbursements.
   The GAO report said the Energy Department's policy is legally
permissible and is rooted in the unusual circumstances surrounding
the origin of the nuclear weapons program. The government felt it
had to offer such financial protection to attract the expertise it
needed to develop the atomic bomb during World War II.
   Today's weapons are made at plants built during and shortly
after the war. The facilities' age, combined with the government's
failure to modernize their waste management, has led to widespread
violation of environmental protection regulations.
   The report said that since 1983, the EPA and various states have
assessed penalties in six cases against Energy Department
contractors for violations of laws governing the handling of
hazardous wastes. Four of those cases are unresolved.
   In the two other cases, settlement agreements were reached in
which payments totaling $295,000 were assessed against the
contractors. The Energy Department paid the fines in full, plus
$528,639 in related legal costs of the contractors.
   The contractors in these cases were not identified.
   In a related development, a special team of inspectors said in a
report released Thursday that workers at the Y-12 nuclear weapons
plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn., are not adequately protected from
exposure to radiation.
   Among the major flaws in the radiation protection system are a
failure of the plant's health physics specialists to routinely
check radiation levels in all areas where significant amounts of
radiation are generated, the report said.
   In response to the report, which was sent to Energy Secretary
James D. Watkins late last month, Watkins ordered Undersecretary
John Tuck to develop a plan to correct the radiation protection
problems and other safety and environmental flaws identified by the
team of private and government inspectors.

   San Francisco attorney Vaughn R. Walker, whose
nomination as a federal judge languished for almost two years,
appears headed for confirmation after approval by the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
   ``After sweeping aside all the mudslinging, the committee
latched onto the truth and overwhelmingly indicated its belief that
Vaughn Walker is qualified to serve on the federal bench,'' Sen.
Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said Thursday after the panel approved the
nomination, 11-2.
   The nomination goes to the full Senate for final action, with
lawmakers scrambling to clear away they last of the nominations
before a planned pre-Thanksgiving adjournment for the year.
   As the committee pushed to wrap up its work, it also approved
and sent to the full Senate seven other judicial nominations,
including that of John M. Walker of New York, a cousin of President
Bush.
   John Walker _ no relation to Vaughn Walker _ is a U.S. district
judge in New York. He has been nominated for a vacancy on the 2nd
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Controversy surrounding Vaughn Walker concerned his 15-year
membership in the Olympic Club of San Francisco, which had no black
members until last year and still excludes women. He resigned Feb.
15 but critics said the move came too late and questioned his claim
to have opposed the exclusion of women.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., told the panel the resignation
and evidence of strenuous opposition to discrimination amounted to
``nothing more than a cynical effort to get himself confirmed.'' He
was joined by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., in opposing the nomination.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., asked the committee in February to
reject Walker because of the club issue. Neither he nor Wilson is a
member of the panel, but the wishes of home-state senators in such
cases often carry weight.
   It has been many years, however, since a home-state senator's
``blue slip,'' as lawmakers call it, would automatically stop a
nomination cold.
   ``I haven't found enough in the record to cause me to vote
against his nomination,'' said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   He said he had spent more time studying the nomination than any
other and added that in rejecting a nominee, ``we are indeed
placing a blot on that individual's record for the rest of his or
her life.''
   ``Frankly, I think that Vaughn Walker did far less than he
should have done or could have done,'' Metzenbaum said. But he
added: ``Frankly, I haven't found enough in the record to vote
against his nomination.''
   Presidential cousin John Walker had been opposed for the appeals
bench by Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz, who said the
nomination represented a violation of the nation's anti-nepotism
law. But no opponents surfaced on the Judiciary Committee.
   Also recommended by the committee were U.S. District Court
nominees Edwin L. Nelson of Alabama, G. Thomas Van Bebber of
Kansas, Susan Webber Wright of Arkansas, Edward W. Nottingham of
Colorado, Arthur D. Spatt of New York and Edward J. Lodge of Idaho.
   The panel approved the nominations as U.S. attorneys of Joyce J.
George of Ohio, Jean Paul Bradshaw of Missouri, Timothy D. Leonard
of Oklahoma and Gene W. Shepard of Iowa. It endorsed Cindy Shinga
Daub of Nebraska as a commissioner of the Copyright Royalty
Tribunal. She is the wife of former Rep. Hal Daub, R-Neb.

   Democratic congressional leaders are
postponing sending President Bush a child care bill because they
couldn't resolve a dispute among members of their own party on how
to provide the new aid.
   ``The child care legislation will be a priority matter early in
the next session,'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley told reporters
Thursday. ``I am absolutely confident that a historic child care
bill will be passed, sent to the president and signed into law in
this Congress.''
   House and Senate negotiators from the relevant education
committees reached agreement last week on a version of the bill
that would have increased direct subsidies through new programs by
$1.2 billion in fiscal 1990.
   In response, Foley had put the bill on a fast track in the hope
of getting a compromise package approved by both the House and
Senate and to Bush's desk before Congress adjourns for the year
next week.
   But Reps. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., and George Miller, D-Calif.,
authors of a competing measure with less money but better able to
withstand future whims of deficit-conscious lawmakers, said they
still intended to press for their own measure if the bill came to a
floor vote.
   Instead of establishing new school-based programs, their bill
would increase child care subsidies by $200 million in 1990 and
$1.8 billion over the next five years through an expansion of block
grant entitlements to states that require no annual appropriations.
   No one knows exactly how much of the current block grants are
devoted to child care, but estimates range from $200 million to
slightly under $1 billion a year.
   Both House versions and the companion Senate package also
envisioned increasing income tax credits for low-income families
with children by $500 to $900 a year.

<HEAD>Tax Credit Bill Would Aid Handicapped Rights: Supporters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A separate House bill that would give small
businesses a tax credit to make special accommodations to the
handicapped will strengthen proposed civil rights legislation for
the nation's 43 million disabled, supporters say.
   The one-time tax credit of up to $5,000 ``will encourage greater
compliance by small businesses'' with the Americans With
Disabilities Act, said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who with Rep.
Kweisi Mfume, D-Md., sponsored the tax bill last month.
   The two lawmakers said at a news conference Thursday that the
bill already has 155 sponsors.
   The bill, if passed, would address a major objection by the
National Federation of Independent Business, the nation's small
business lobby, that the disabilities act gives businesses no
financial help for the changes they would be forced to make.
   The disabilities act would require all businesses to make their
premises accessible to the handicapped, but it exempts them if such
changes would create an ``undue hardship.'' The business lobby
contends that the ``undue hardship'' provision, though defined in
the statute, will leave businesses at the mercy of an individual
judge's whims.
   Businesses already are eligible for a $35,000 deduction for the
removal of architectural and transportation barriers, but the
sponsors of the tax bill say that can't help the smaller businesses.
   The deduction would be cut to $20,000 under the Mfume-Upton
bill, and the credit would be expanded to include special services,
such as deaf interpreters or equipment modifications.
   The one-time credit would be limited to businesses with fewer
than 15 employees and with annual gross receipts of less than $1
million.
   Pending Senate legislation would grant the tax credit but
eliminate the deduction altogether.
   Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference
on Civil Rights, said the disabilities act already addresses the
``legitimate concerns of small business,'' but would not oppose
separate tax relief legislation.
   ``We would certainly be willing to discuss ways after the
enactment of the Americans With Disabilities Act of providing
incentives for businesses to comply with this historic
legislation,'' said Neas, whose coalition represents supporters of
the bill.
   He said the ADA will save $300 billion per year in the public
and private sectors and will provide businesses ``more qualified
employees, more customers and less taxes.''

<HEAD>Archives May be Helping Make a `Mockery' of Cigarette TV Advertising
Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Archives should have heeded its
own misgivings about involving the nation's largest cigarette
manufacturer in a campaign to celebrate the bicentennial of the
Bill of Rights, a House panel chairman says.
   By not doing so, Rep. Thomas Luken said the Archives might be
helping Philip Morris Cos. Inc. make ``a mockery'' of the federal
ban on cigarette advertisements on television and radio.
   The Ohio Democrat revealed at a hearing Thursday that the agency
had expressed its qualms in a letter to the company a year ago.
Luken chairs the House Subcommittee on Transportation and Hazardous
Materials, which is investigating the arrangement.
   The agency had ``reservations about the appropriateness of
Philip Morris' role in advertising the Bill of Rights exhibition,''
said Susan Cooper, spokeswoman for the Archives, in the November
1988 letter.
   However, under an August agreement with Philip Morris, the
Archives allowed the company to publish and broadcast promotions of
the Bill of Rights' 200th anniversary in exchange for a $600,000
donation to the National Archives Trust Fund. The materials carry
the names of both Philip Morris and the Archives.
   The agreement has come under fire from anti-smoking groups and
members of Congress.
   The Archives and the Justice Department ``should pursue whether
there is a violation'' or cause for possible prosecution, Luken
said.
   Claudine J. Weiher, deputy archivist, told the panel the agency
questioned the ``propriety'' not the ``legality'' of the
advertising campaign.
   ``What we reviewed these segments or ads for was to assure
ourselves in our own minds that no such advocacy was there,'' said
Weiher.
   But an attorney for Philip Morris argued the nationally
televised announcement is not restricted.
   ``Even those who have tried to find fault with the Philip Morris
ads have not, to my knowledge, asserted that the spots advertise
cigarettes in the commonly understood sense of the term,'' said
Richard Wiley, a former chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission.
   The ban ``extends only to messages that promote the sale or use
of particular tobacco products,'' added Riley.
   ``What our critics object to is not what is being said, but who
is saying it,'' added David I. Greenberg, a Philip Morris vice
president.
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. is the holding company for a
conglomerate that produces a variety of consumer products including
Kraft cheese, Maxwell House coffee and Oscar Mayer meats as well as
Marlboro cigarettes.
   ``Philip Morris is synonymous with cigarettes,'' said Luken,
adding the letter showed the Archives had similar concerns.
   ``Given the First Amendment issues relating to smoking, he (U.S.
Archivist Don Wilson) is concerned that the context in which the
exhibition would be advertised might lead to a negative public
response,'' Cooper said in the letter, dated Nov. 10, 1988.
   As a federal government agency, ``we cannot appear to be
associated with the implicit endorsement of a philosophy behind a
product,'' she added.
   In fact, Cooper suggested the Archives work with another of the
Philip Morris corporate entities ``such as General Foods, with whom
we have worked in the past'' on the educational component of the
Bill of Rights campaign.
   The company rejected the idea.
   Weiher said the agency had rejected initial materials submitted
by Philip Morris for the two-year campaign because they ``appeared
to promote smoking.''

   Perestroika could spell profit for American
businesses, whose sympathetic cheering for the reformers in the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe isn't entirely humanistic.
   The tentative moves under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to convert to an economy adaptable to Western trade and investment
have sent American lawyers and entrepreneurs to Moscow in the
search for profit.
   With the energy of a Harriman or Rockefeller, they will slice
their way through the red tape, and if new emigration legislation
causes President Bush and Congress to waive 14-year-old tariff
barriers, the current $3 billion a year in two-way trade will
multiply like fast-food joints on the Via Venuto and the Champs
d'Elysee.
   Glory be. Before too long, Russians, Poles, East Germans and
Hungarians could be gobbling hamburgers and greasy french fries
like most of the rest of us.
   And as Konstantin Katushev, the Soviet minister for foreign
economic relations, said in signing a new commercial agreement
Thursday with Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, American
women will be wearing Russian furs.
   But if the truth be told, it is Asia where opportunity beckons.
   Already, U.S. trade with the Asian countries exceeds trade with
Western Europe by a cool $100 billion a year.
   Japan's phenomenal growth is apparent. The next car that passes
yours on the way to Thanksgiving dinner at grandma's is likely to
be Japanese. And the Japanese are buying Rockefeller Center.
   But the prosperity is much broader than that. South Korea,
Taiwan and Singapore are all growing by leaps and bounds.
   If Horace Greeley were around today his advice undoubtedly would
be: ``Go East, young man.''
   And East is where the State Department has been looking lately.
   Responding to an invitation from Australia, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III went to Canberra last week to proclaim U.S.
support for a new grouping of 12 nations known as the Pacific Rim.
   They are committed to free trade and to the proposition that it
will bring with it political democracy.
   South Korea is the case most frequently cited by administration
officials as they praise the benefits of free trade, market
economies and unrestrained capitalism.
   The Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc may be shifting away from
traditional Marxism. But they are not ready to replace Karl Marx
with Adam Smith.
   Gorbachev warned the West this week not to revel in the failures
of communism or to try to ``export capitalism.''
   There are no such warnings from Tokyo or Seoul.
   The 12 countries, including the United States, that met in
Canberra are determined to make trade among themselves easier _ and
to fan out from their club to the rest of the world.
   ``The strength of Japan and the United States has been built on
a world in which we've been able to trade free,'' Prime Minister
Bob Hawke of Australia said afterward.
   The initial results were modest. The ministers agreed to improve
communications among the 12 nations and to make smoother
transportation arrangements for the delivery of goods.
   Follow-up meetings were scheduled for Singapore and Seoul.
   ``I don't know whether I would use the term historic yet,''
Baker said. ``But I think this has the potential to qualify for
that type of description.''
   Compared with the riveting events at the Berlin Wall, the
conference in Canberra received scant attention.
   But Hawke pronounced solemnly: ``There is no doubt that we have
already moved into the Pacific century.''
   It would be foolhardy to disagree.

<HEAD>Outlook for Quick Stello Confirmation Appears Bleak</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's chances of winning
quick confirmation of Victor Stello Jr. as chief of nuclear weapons
production appear lost.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, in an unusual personal plea
to the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the administration
wanted Stello confirmed before Congress starts its two-month
recess, probably next week.
   But Thursday, after two days of hearings on Stello's fitness for
the post, the committee acknowledged it was unsure how and when to
act on the nomination.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the panel chairman, said the 20-member
committee would meet in closed session this afternoon to consider
its next step. He said one option was to bring Stello back to
supplement the testimony he delivered Wednesday.
   Watkins told the committee Wednesday that he urgently needed a
confirmed assistant secretary for defense programs to carry out the
reforms needed to get the weapons production complex in full
operation again. Key elements of the complex have been shut down in
recent months for safety reasons.
   Stello, the chief of staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
is accused by opponents of being lax on nuclear safety matters. He
has stoutly denied that and contended he's fully qualified for the
weapons post.
   ``Mr. Stello should not be in this kind of position of
responsibility,'' Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., told Nunn's
committee Thursday. Kostmayer is chairman of a House Interior
investigations subcommittee that held hearings earlier this year on
Stello's NRC activities.
   At least two committee members, Democratic Sens. Timothy Wirth
of Colorado and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, oppose the
nomination, and Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, has strongly hinted that
he believes Stello is ill-suited for the post.
   Wirth took the lead during the first two days of hearings in
seeking to draw out details of numerous allegations of professional
misconduct and poor judgment by Stello during his tenure at the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which regulates commercial nuclear
power.
   Wirth's questioning of opposition witnesses Thursday prompted
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to accuse the panel's Democratic
majority of using stalling tactics to scuttle the nomination.
   ``This is becoming hauntingly familiar to me,'' McCain said
later, referring directly to the committee's lengthy confirmation
hearing on John Tower as President Bush's nominee for defense
secretary. The panel voted not to recommend Tower's confirmation,
and he was rejected by the Senate in March.
   ``I am very sorry to see it happen again to a candidate of
proven qualifications,'' McCain said, adding that he believed it
was ``pretty predictable'' that the committee would not vote
favorably on Stello's nomination.
   McCain left the hearing and did not return.
   Two former chairmen of the NRC during Stello's tenure at the
agency, Lando Zech Jr. and Marcus Rowden, praised Stello and urged
his nomination be confirmed.
   ``I know him as a man of honor, integrity, competence,'' said
Zech, who retired in July after three years as NRC chairman. ``Adm.
Watkins is absolutely correct in the choice he has made.''
   Robert Pollard, a former NRC staffer who worked under Stello in
the 1970s, said he had no doubts about Stello's personal character
but that his record as a nuclear regulator showed he was willing to
put production goals ahead of safety concerns.

<HEAD>Bush Will Veto State Department Bill: Advisers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will veto a two-year bill
authorizing operations of the State Department because it contains
restrictions that would tie the president's hands in foreign
policy, his top advisers say.
   The constitutional conflict was created when the Senate approved
the $9.7 billion measure Thursday and sent it to the White House
after weeks of talks aimed at finding a compromise broke down.
   A veto would scuttle not only the authorization for most U.S.
diplomatic activities, but also a series of trade sanctions against
China in response to last summer's brutal crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   In a legal provision arising from the Iran-Contra scandal, the
bill would bar the president from using U.S. aid money to entice
foreign governments to carry out policies that are contrary to
American law.
   In a letter to Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary
of state, said the new congressional restrictions would ``severely
hamper the conduct of U.S. foreign policy and would impose an
unfair and unreasonable burden on our diplomats and on the conduct
of our diplomacy and intelligence activities.''
   The confrontation left bruised feelings among White House allies
on Capitol Hill and anger at White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray.
   ``To say that this will be vetoed comes very close to saying the
presidency is above the law,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., who sponsored the provision.
   Moynihan said the White House is being controlled on the issue
by ``a group of young lawyers'' who are arguing the president has
the prerogative to set foreign policy, but who are ignoring that
the Constitution provides for shared powers.
   ``It became apparent to me that the lawyers at the White House
got their noses involved in substance, and not law,'' said Sen.
Warren Rudman, R-N.H., who had sought to work out a compromise. ``I
frankly think it's left some scars that are very deep with people
up here.''
   The bill would prohibit use of U.S. aid money to ``leverage''
policy moves by a foreign country that the United States would be
unable to carry out itself because of legal restrictions.
   It is aimed at situations like one several years ago in which
aid money was expedited to Honduras in exchange for that country's
harboring of the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contra rebels, at a time
when Congress barred direct or indirect U.S. military support for
the rebels.
   Moynihan's initiative would provide for criminal penalties for
violators, but made clear that the president would not be barred
from expressing ``his views to any party on any subject.''
   The same fight may well be waged on another front, as well. A
similar provision, only without the criminal penalties, has been
made part of the 1990 foreign aid spending bill.
   The China sanctions include suspension of risk insurance for
companies doing business in China, suspension of trade assistance,
a freeze on exports of U.S. satellites, a halt to sales of
controlled munitions and an end to sale of certain nuclear
materials and components.

   Novelist John Le Carre, whose best-known books
powerfully evoke the Berlin Wall, said the breach of that Cold War
symbol has left the West uncertain about how to react.
   ``The West, having got what it's been saying it wanted all those
years, doesn't know from Adam what to do with it,'' he wrote in
Thursday's Guardian newspaper.
   But Le Carre said the changes in the East bloc present no
obstacles for spy writers: ``Don't imagine for one second that,
just because the Cold War's over, the spooks aren't having a ball.''
   The 58-year-old Englishman, whose real name is David Cornwell,
said his first best seller, ``The Spy Who Came In From The Cold,''
emerged from the anger he felt on first seeing the Berlin Wall. In
it, his two main characters are shot to death as they try to get
over the wall to West Berlin.
   Le Carre said ``The Russia House,'' his latest novel, ``drew on
the Cold War in order to show that it was over for everyone except
the professionals. That the wall should be coming down while my
book is still around fills me with quiet joy.''

   An attorney for Indian activist Leonard
Peltier, who was convicted in the 1975 slayings of two FBI agents,
says he hopes a film by director Oliver Stone may help get his
client out of jail.
   William Kunstler, who heads the legal team handling Peltier's
appeals, said Stone, whose film credits include ``Platoon'' and
``Wall Street,'' is working on a movie about Peltier. Kunstler said
Wednesday he has been paid as a consultant.
   ``It's a valuable adjunct to a long cause and a very valuable
cause, and I hope it has something to do with getting Leonard out
of jail,'' the New York attorney said.
   But Lynn Crooks, an assistant U.S. attorney in Fargo who was one
of the prosecutors in the Peltier trial, is not enthused about the
prospect of a movie _ especially one in which defense lawyers are
paid consultants.
   ``It doesn't take any rocket scientist to figure out where the
bias is going to be,'' Crooks said.
   Peltier, a Chippewa from North Dakota, is serving a life
sentence for the 1975 murders of two FBI agents on the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation in South Dakota.

   Gary Cooper's daughter, Maria Cooper Janis, says
her father started out wanting to be an artist, while painter Pablo
Picasso fancied himself a hand with a six-shooter.
   Cooper, hero of many a horse opera in his 98-movie acting
career, was always sketching and ``was frustrated that he never had
the time to make good paintings,'' Maria Cooper Janis wrote in a
remembrance of her father in next week's Parade magazine.
   ``Picasso and his wife, Jacqueline, were friends of my parents,
and we often visited them in the south of France,'' she said.
   ``On one visit, Poppa presented the painter with a six-shooter
and the white Stetson he had worn in `Saratoga Trunk.' Picasso was
thrilled, and the two of them spent the afternoon firing at beer
cans they set up as targets.
   ``Picasso was far more accurate with a brush than with a gun, it
turned out, but Poppa, in his gentlemanly way, deliberately missed
shot after shot and the two men had a grand old time.''

   Rap musician Tracy Lynn Curry of The D.O.C.
was in stable condition after losing control of his car on the
Ventura Freeway, authorities said.
   Curry, 21, suffered injuries to his face, including damage to
one eye and his nose, said California Highway Patrol Officer David
Grajeda. He was in stable condition Thursday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, said spokesman Ron Wise.
   Grajeda said Curry had alcohol on his breath after the accident
Tuesday and was arrested but released before being booked so he
could get medical attention.
   The D.O.C.'s song ``No One Can Do It Better'' was No. 12 on this

<TEXT>
   The South African government says it has no
connection with an alleged conspiracy to illegally ship missile
guidance equipment worth $50 million to its state-owned arms
company.
   Three South African businessmen and two Americans were indicted
Thursday as part of a U.S. Customs Service sting operation aimed at
stemming the illegal export of high-technology items and military
hardware.
   The five were accused of plotting to ship gyroscopes
manufactured by Northrop Corp. through Israel to Armscor, the South
African national arms company.
   Armscor, which stands for the Armaments Development and
Production Corp., makes more than 95 percent of the South African
military's weapons and sells to 32 countries.
   At a news conference, U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said ``the
inference to be drawn'' is that Armscor ``either requested'' the
defendants to get the gyroscopes or that the arms brokers knew
Armscor would be an ``interested purchaser.''
   However, Patrick Evans, a spokesman at the South African Embassy
in Washington, said his country was ``well aware'' of the U.S. laws
and regulations, ``particularly in the field of the arms boycott,''
and would do nothing to circumvent them.
   ``The natural extension of that statement is that there is no
one in South Africa or its agencies who is involved in this
matter,'' Evans said.
   Stephens said the investigation was over.
   Congress, to encourage an end to apartheid, in 1986 prohibited
the export of a wide array of military items to South Africa.
   The conspirators had supplied material to the South Africans in
the past and the South African government is ``going to have a lot
of business flowing our way,'' one of the conspirators, Frank J.
Randazzo, 32, of Virginia, told the undercover agents, according to
an affidavit by a Customs agent.
   One of the South Africans charged, Symone Morris Behrmann, 32,
said that Israel Aircraft Industries, a state-owned concern, would
help obtain the gyroscopes for a price that would be ``very high,''
according to the affidavit.
   Behrmann reportedly met with the owner of IAI in Israel, the
affidavit added.
   The affidavit said the Israeli company contacted Northrop in
1988 and made a request for gyroscopes that ``is nearly identical''
to those sought by the five people charged.
   In addition to conspiracy, the five were indicted on charges of
violating the Arms Export Control Act and the Anti-Apartheid Act.
   In addition to Randazzo and Behrmann, those charged by a federal
grand jury were: Guy Perfezou, a South African resident and his
company, Perfezou Imports &amp; Exports Ltd. of Maraisburg in South
Africa; Lester George Buckingham Talbot, a South African resident;
and Maryanne E. Callaghan of Warwick, R.I. Behrmann lives in
Toronto. Behrmann, Perfezou and Randazzo also were accused of money
laundering.
   Behrmann, Callaghan and Randazzo have been arrested.

<TEXT>
   A $43.6 billion Agriculture Department
spending bill is on its way to the president's desk for his
expected signature to start money flowing to finance scores of food
and farm programs for fiscal 1990.
   The department has been operating under temporary measures that
have kept spending at 1989 levels while Congress settled
differences on programs for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   Both the House and Senate gave speedy final approval by voice
vote Thursday to the bill, which provides money for agricultural
research, conservation, price supports, marketing and inspection,
domestic nutrition and export and international activities.
   The measure had been hung up in conference committee for weeks
because of a dispute between Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and Rep.
Jamie Whitten, D-Miss. over a $1.1 million hotline program for
farmers.
   Bumpers wanted to preserve the hotline, which informs farmers
how to reduce pesticides and herbicides, against the wishes of
Whitten, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.
   Bumpers finally agreed to stop his effort, saying he will try to
shift the program to the Interior Department.
   The standoff between Bumpers and Whitten had delayed the finish
of negotiations on a compromise reconciling differences between
House and Senate versions of the spending bill.
   ``It took less time for the Pilgrims to sail to the New World
than for this conference report to return to the House,'' said Rep.
Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, ranking Republican on the
Appropriations Committee.
   The House approved its original version of the bill 10 weeks ago.
   ``Half the bill is for food and consumer programs,'' Whitten
said, adding that there are increases for water and sewer needs in
the rural development section of the bill. Funds for conservation
programs were held at last year's level.
   The measure finances cooperative research, extension service,
marketing and export enhancements also were kept at last year's
levels, but total spending is about $3 billion less than last year.
   Major reductions came from lower spending for farm income
protection and price support operations, said Rep. Virginia Smith,
R-Neb.
   She said $11.3 billion would be spent on farm program payments,
which is more than $2 billion lower than 1989 spending projections.
   ``More than half of the money will be used to benefit the entire
public, not just agriculture,'' she said. ``These programs include
school lunch programs, nutrition assistance for the poor and
elderly, international trade programs, food and drug safety
monitoring.''

<HEAD>Investigation Into Blood Disorder Mystery Reaches Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators are visiting homes in New Mexico
and chemical manufacturers in Japan as part of a wide-ranging
effort to explain reports of an unusual blood disorder in 35 states.
   A major question is what role, if any, is being played by a
nutritional supplement called L-tryptophan.
   So far, 243 possible cases of the blood disease have been
reported from the 35 states and the District of Columbia, said
Edwin Kilbourne of the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   One woman in Minnesota has died from the disorder, state
epidemiologist Michael Osterholm said.
   In New Mexico, only 15 of 30 reported possible cases turned out
to be confirmed, a spokesman for state health authorities said
Thursday.
   Investigators are calling the disorder eosinophilia-myalgia
syndrome, and say it is not clear whether it is a new condition. It
includes an abnormally high number of white blood cells called
eosinophils, plus severe muscle pain, called myalgia.
   Its cause has not been determined, but since many patients
report having taken L-tryptophan supplements, the Food and Drug
Administration has advised consumers to stop taking the tablets or
capsules temporarily.
   Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., introduced a bill in Congress on
Thursday to extend a New Mexico ban on L-tryptophan supplements
nationwide.
   ``Preliminary studies indicate there is an association between
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and L-tryptophan,'' he said. ``If the
Food and Drug Administration won't ban this product and protect the
American public, then Congress ought to.''
   Doses of L-tryptophan are used by some people for insomnia,
depression, premenstrual syndrome, or appetite control. The
supplements have been sold in a variety of stores, but on Tuesday a
food industry group asked retailers, distributors and wholesalers
to suspend sales temporarily.
   L-tryptophan is a building block of protein in a wide variety of
foods. A normal diet includes about .04 ounce of it a day, said
Richard Wurtman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   The body needs it to produce proteins and a substance called
serotonin that helps brain cells communicate, he said.
   Among the mysteries investigators face are whether the
supplements have anything to do with the syndrome, and if so,
whether the problem is the L-tryptophan itself or some contaminant.
   The syndrome is being investigated in all 50 states, Kilbourne
said.
   In New Mexico, for example, researchers are combing laboratory
and medical records for potential cases of the disorder, and then
interviewing the affected people.
   In the half-hour interviews, investigators ask about more than
30 possible causes, including use of raw meats and fish and various
medications as well as L-tryptophan, said Millicent Eidson,
environmental epidemiologist at the state Health and Environment
Department.
   Then investigators go to neighbors, seeking somebody of the same
sex and age as the affected person to ask the same questions. The
idea is to see if any possible cause pops up much more often among
the affected people than unaffected ones.
   Such a study recently found that all 10 affected people studied
had taken L-tryptophan supplements, while only two of 20 healthy
people had used them. The odds of that happening simply by chance
were only five in 100,000, Eidson said.
   Meanwhile, the FDA is following up on the fact that most
L-tryptophan used in supplements sold in the United States appears
to come from four or fewer Japanese manufacturers, said Douglas
Archer, director of the microbiology division at the FDA's Center
for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
   FDA representatives who happened to be in Japan are inspecting
the suppliers there, he said.
   FDA has also sent cables to those companies to ask for such
information as manufacturing processes, sources of raw materials
and how the substance is purified, he said.
   In Washington, FDA researchers are analyzing L-tryptophan
capsules obtained from people with the syndrome, as well as samples
from manufacturers. More than 65 brands are included.
   One task is to look for contaminants, which is difficult because
investigators do not know what kind of substance to seek, Archer
said.
   J.B. Cordaro, president of a food industry group called the
Council for Responsible Nutrition, said industry and federal
studies have not turned up any evidence of contamination.

   A big birthday bash is planned for Carrie
White, who turns 115 Saturday and is recognized by the Guinness
Book of World Records as the oldest living person on Earth.
   As many as 800 guests are expected at the party planned for
Monday at Putnam Memorial Nursing Home, where Mrs. White lives, and
there will be a big cake, nursing home adminstrator Paul Allen said.
   When she turned 114, Guinness representatives gave Mrs. White a
gold embossed certificate declaring her the oldest person alive,
though she was not listed as such in the 1989 edition of the record
book because hospital records certifying her age had not been
authenticated in time.
   Most of Mrs. White's life is a sad mystery. She spent 75 years
in a mental institution.
   She was born Carrie Joyner on Nov. 18, 1874, in Gadsden County
near Georgia. She lived and worked near Tallahassee and married
John White, who was a blacksmith or farmer.
   In 1909 her husband admitted her to the Florida State Hospital
at Chattahoochee; hospital records described Mrs. White's problem
as ``post-typhoid psychosis,'' but doctors today don't recognize
the term.
   Mrs. White wasn't released until 1984, and when asked now, she
either can't or won't talk about her past, said Marjorie Allen, her
guardian.
   ``The wall would just go up,'' Mrs. Allen said, and Mrs. White
would become silent. ``I know that she can think back. I can see
the expressions. I can see the bitterness. So I do not delve any
more with Carrie.''
   ``What's the point of that? What I'm concerned about is Carrie
now _ that she has a happy life.''

<TEXT>
   Senate and House negotiators are trying to get
a derailed $938 million three-year aid plan for Poland and Hungary
back on track before Solidarity leader Lech Walesa ends his U.S.
visit.
   The bill authorizing the aid funds hit a sudden snag Thursday
night after Republican senators complained that most of the
safeguards they had added to the measure to prevent misuse of the
money had been removed by Democratic staff members.
   One such amendment would terminate the program if the aid were
converted into military assistance to Nicaragua or Cuba.
   After hours of consultations, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, halted Senate consideration of the measure,
reinstituted the chamber's original bill with the GOP amendments
intact and sent it to a formal conference with negotiators from
both chambers.
   Although Mitchell called for speedy action, the development will
delay final passage of the aid measure that Walesa has said will
give his country a badly needed boost as it attempts to build
democratic institutions and moves to a free-market economy. Walesa
leaves the United States on Monday.
   The Senate impasse developed hours after the House approved a
version of the measure authorizing $846.54 million for Poland and
$91.5 million for Hungary.
   The House added a $200 million standby trade credit insurance
program for Poland, a provision not included in the Senate-passed
bill.
   But when the measure was sent back to the Senate for approval,
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the ranking GOP member of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, angrily objected.
   ``This measure was mutilated by Democratic staff members,''
Helms complained.
   ``Staff members of the majority party were allowed to rip apart
this bill. They hijacked this bill on the way to the House. Many of
the most worthy provisions have been eliminated.''
   Earlier, the House voted 372-47 to approve the measure.
   As approved by the House, the bill authorizes $200 million to
help Poland shore up the value of its currency, which has been
battered by inflation and creates a $240 million private enterprise
fund to bolster free-market reforms.

<HEAD>Human Rights Activist Goes on Trial in Cuba</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a case that has attracted international
attention, Cuba's best-known human rights activist and two allies
were going on trial today in Havana on charges of spreading false
news about the government.
   Elizardo Sanchez, president of the Cuban Commission on Human
Rights and National Reconciliation, faces a jail term of up to four
years for what the government regards as slanderous information he
gave to American reporters last summer.
   Private human rights organizations say the Aug. 6 arrest of
Sanchez is part of a broader deterioration in rights protection in
Cuba.
   The government had been giving activists such a Sanchez greater
leeway over the preceding two years, allowing him to meet without
interference with American and other foreign journalists.
   The other defendants in the trial at Havana Provincial Court are
Hiran Abi Cobas and Hubert Jerez, who also have been active in the
rights movement. The trial has been postponed several times because
Abi was ill.
   At least two foreign human rights organization asked for
permission to monitor the trial but were turned down by Cuban
authorities.
   Sanchez's troubles began in June when he publicly criticized the
government's handling of disgraced military hero Gen. Arnaldo
Ochoa, who was convicted on drug and corruption charges and was
executed the next month.
   Sanchez once suggested to an American television reporter that
Ochoa had not been mentally alert during his trial because he had
been given a drug or sedative. He found fault with other aspects of
Ochoa's treatment and, once the death sentence had been carried
out, he said, ``This was a public assassination carried out in
judicial clothes.''
   Congressional staff members and other Americans who have
traveled to Havana to plead for leniency for Sanchez were told that
his remarks constituted an attack on the integrity of the
revolution and on President Fidel Castro.
   The Cuban officials told the visitors that suggestions of legal
improprieties could lead some to conclude that Castro had been
overlooking the activities of Ochoa, a one-time trusted lieutenant,
thus exposing Castro to charges of complicity.
   One subplot to the case is that Sanchez has been viewed with
suspicion by the more conservative members of the Cuban exile
community, who disagree with his philosophy of ``national
reconciliation'' because it implies acceptance of continued rule by
Castro.
   Some critics had even accused him of being a government agent.
   Those accusations have been muted since Sanchez's arrest. He
said in a letter smuggled out of Cuba that he was subjected to
severe hardship during his first five weeks of confinement.
   He recently spent several days at a psychiatric hospital where
some political prisoners say they have been subjected to abusive
treatment. Sanchez is reported to have been treated well.
   In 1986, Sanchez, a former philosophy professor, was detained
for eight months for talking to two foreign reporters. It was after
his release that the Cuban government began to show more tolerance
for activists such as Sanchez.
   Working out of his garage, Sanchez kept copious records of the
victims of perceived rights abuses. In July, shortly before his
arrest, he confided to foreign reporters that he felt he might soon
lose his freedom.
   Almost 30 Cubans who had spoken to the U.N. Commission on Human
Rights in September 1988 had been detained, and there was no sign
that Castro was intent on imitating some East European countries by
permitting greater individual freedom.
   Recently, 30 members of Congress sent a letter to Castro calling
Sanchez and his two colleagues ``Cuban patriots'' and demanding
their immediate release.
   Americas Watch, a New York-based human rights group, said in a
statement this week that Cuba has become ``increasingly
intolerant'' on rights questions.
   Wayne Smith, a former U.S. diplomat who advocates better
relations with Cuba, said after making an appeal on Sanchez's
behalf last month in Havana that he was ``mildly hopeful'' he would
be treated leniently.
   But to some, that hope seemed to fade Wednesday when police
arrested Sanchez's brother-in-law and fellow human rights activist,
Yndamiro Restano.

<HEAD>Three Out Of Four Big-City Crooks Use Cocaine, Study Finds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half of the criminal suspects in many
of the nation's big cities had used cocaine within a few days of
their arrests, a federal study shows.
   The study indicated that three-quarters of the criminals in New
York and Philadelphia, and 65 percent of those in Washington, D.C.,
use cocaine.
   One official said it showed that ``the real drug problem'' is in
the nation's criminal sector.
   ``We could find the large bulk of drug users by looking at the
13 million arrests made each year,'' said Eric Wish of the National
Institute of Justice, an arm of the Justice Department that
conducted the survey.
   The Centers for Disease Control released the study Thursday.
   Since 1986, the institute has monitored drugs in selected cities
with tests that detect cocaine use within the previous two to three
days, Wish said. Those surveyed included people arrested for most
crimes except traffic violations and vagrancy.
   In testing in 14 cities last January, February and March, four
other cities reported cocaine use by half or more of the arrested
men: New Orleans, 59 percent; Cleveland, 56 percent; Detroit, 54
percent; and Dallas, 50 percent.
   ``The prevalence of recent cocaine use among arrestees ... is
striking,'' the CDC said, noting that the percentage of arrested
men who used cocaine in New Orleans had doubled from 1987 to 1989.
   ``The overwhelming conclusion from all these data is that most
dysfunctional drug use _ the primary demand _ is coming from the
criminal population,'' Wish said.
   The amount of drug use among criminals varied, however, with
only 24 percent of those detained in San Antonio testing positive
for cocaine.
   Other cities where tests were done included St. Louis, 47
percent; Kansas City, 44 percent; San Diego, 42 percent; Portland,
36 percent; Phoenix, about 30 percent, and Indianapolis, 26 percent.
   Fewer than 25 percent of those tested in the survey were
arrested for drug crimes, officials said.
   The survey indicated that fewer criminals use marijuana than
cocaine. Marijuana use ranged from 44 percent of those tested in
San Diego to 13 percent in New York and Washington.
   The survey also tested for opiates and amphetamines; all cities
reported less than 20 percent for each except San Diego, which
reported 35 percent using amphetamines.
   Researchers also asked arrested men about their drug habits.
Between 38 percent (in San Diego) and 15 percent (in Dallas)
reported that they had used injectible drugs at some time.
   In 11 cities, more than 20 percent of those using injectible
drugs said they were sharing needles with other users.
   That, according to the CDC, ``indicates that a substantial
proportion of the arrestees engage in behaviors that put them at
increased risk for transmission of HIV,'' the virus which causes
AIDS.

   House-passed legislation aims at strengthening
congressional ethics rules, but also would repeal a tough new law
to prevent abuses in federal contract procurement.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the House Government
Operations Committee, criticized the deletion Thursday and
described it as the Bush administration's price for supporting the
pay-ethics package.
   House members voted 252-174 Thursday to raise their pay by more
than $30,000 a year over the next 13 months _ to above $120,000
annually _ while eliminating acceptance of honoraria and limiting
other outside income. Federal judges and top executive branch
officials also would get higher pay.
   The procurement law, which took effect in July, was largely a
response to a Defense Department procurement scandal involving
payoffs and leaks of inside information to contractors and
consultants.
   The procurement legislation prohibits contractors from offering
gratuities to federal employees and makes it illegal for government
officials to solicit or accept gifts.
   The law also prohibits the disclosure of sensitive information
and establishes a two-year period after government employment,
during which procurement officials are barred from working on the
contracts they handled.
   ``Now, in the middle of the night, the president has exacted the
repeal of this provision as the price for much-needed pay reform,''
Conyers said. ``We have given the procurement process back to those
companies that have brought us Operation Ill Wind (the name given
to the Pentagon investigation) and similar scandals.''
   The reforms passed by the House includes provisions to curb
excessive free travel, food and lodging on trips sponsored by
special interest groups.
   ``The principal issue ... is the public perception that such
trips often may amount to paid vacations for the member and his
family,'' the bipartisan House ethics task force that wrote the
reforms said in a report Thursday.
   The House package would end acceptance of honoraria in 1991
except when the money is given to charity. But congressional
watchdogs have long recognized that fully paid trips to a
conference at Hilton Head Island, S.C., can be worth more than the
$2,000 per speech a lawmaker could earn addressing the gathering.
   The package would prohibit acceptance of travel, lodging and
food expenses for more than four consecutive days for trips in the
continental United States, and seven consecutive days (excluding
travel days) for foreign travel.
   The language would allow the House ethics committee to grant
waivers, and permit the member to accept expenses for one relative.
There currently are no time limits on such trips.
   The ethics package has a broad range of other provisions,
including a limit on earned outside income of 15 percent of salary
starting in 1991 and a prohibition on receipt of gifts from
non-family members of more than $200 a year, beginning Jan. 1, 1990.
   The House ethics committee _ formally the Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct _ would divide into separate subcommittees to
investigate a case and conduct a trial phase. In 1993, the package
would end a perk that allows House members who were in office in
1980 to keep leftover campaign money when they retire. New
categories of financial disclosure would be established.
   These reforms come with strings attached, because Congress would
receive annual, automatic cost-of-living increases based on an
economic index. Also, none of the reforms would take effect unless
the full pay raise voted Thursday actually goes into effect.
   Congress could, if it chooses, repeal some or all of the raise
next year. The bulk of the increase doesn't become effective until
Jan. 1, 1991.

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
Friday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange hit a fifth
straight record high.
   The dollar closed at 143.98 yen, up 0.13 yen from Thursday's
close of 143.85 yen. After opening at 144.17 yen, the currency
ranged between 143.95 yen and 144.25 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues added 87.40
points, or 0.24 percent, to close the week at 35,963.74. It gained
24.11 points Thursday.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's firmness to a
better-than-expected improvement in the U.S. trade deficit in
September.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Thursday that the nation's
trade deficit with the rest of the world fell to $7.9 billion, down
21 percent from $10.2 billion in August.
   ``After quickly digesting the trade news, the exchange market
moved slowly in the morning because of a lack of new incentives,''
said Kenichi Nakao, a dealer with the Mitsubishi Bank.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a news conference Friday
that Japanese monetary authorities are continuing to watch
developments in the foreign exchange market carefully, while
maintaining contact with other Group of Seven industrial nations.
   A strong dollar tends to boost the U.S. trade deficit by making
imports cheaper and pushing up the prices of American goods on
foreign markets.
   The Group of Seven is comprised of the United States, Japan,
Britain, France, West Grmany, Italy and Canada.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index rose following the
favorable reaction to the improvement in the U.S. trade balance.
Many market players had predicted a deficit of $8.9 billion.
   ``Investors actively sought shares over a broad range,'' said a
dealer with a major Japanese securities firm who spoke anonymously.

<HEAD>Despite US Pressure, PLO Not Welcome at Peace Talks, Shamir Says</HEAD>

   Israel will not accept the Palestine
Liberation Organization at Middle East peace talks, despite
pressure from the Bush administration, Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir told Jewish leaders.
   Shamir, speaking to a gathering of American Jewish groups on
Thursday, called the PLO a brutal terrorist organization ``totally
disqualified as a partner to peace.''
   ``On this issue, we have a difference of view with some of our
American friends,'' Shamir told the 3,300 representatives from the
Council of Jewish Federations, which includes some 200 Jewish
communities.
   Shamir met with former President Reagan in Cincinnati earlier in
the day and praised the ``understanding and support'' of the Reagan
administration. But he indicated disagreement with President Bush,
at least on the PLO question.
   ``There are legitimate differences between us,'' Shamir said.
``After all, it is only natural that the United States government
wants to see tranquility and peace in the Middle East, and regards
the ways and means to that end as secondary in importance.
   ``But, for Israel, every step towards that common objective is
fraught with risk. One blunder can be fatal. These differences
cannot, and will not, change the very solid friendship between our
nation. Israel is a loyal and dependable ally.''
   Outside the Cincinnati Convention Center, a small group of PLO
supporters carrying signs urged united peace talks. Earlier, Shamir
had been given a statement from a group of American Jews
criticizing him for his hard-line stand.
   ``Take back this message to the people of Israel: There is a
very high cost for your endless stalling,'' the letter said. ``We
who support Israel are deeply concerned that unless you make a
realistic commitment to pursue a political settlement, you will do
lasting damage to the State of Israel and to the Jewish people.''
   The letter was delivered by Michael Lerner, editor of Tikkun, an
Oakland, Calif.-based magazine of liberal Jewish thought. Lerner
said the statement was endorsed by a meeting of 900 Jewish
intellectuals last Sunday in San Francisco.
   Uri Dromi, a Los Angeles-based representative of the World
Zionist Organization, said presenting the letter to Shamir was an
embarrassment.
   ``It's unfair to twist Israel's arm by putting pressure on the
prime minister in this way,'' Dromi said. ``He is the elected prime
minister of Israel and we should support him.''

   The following is a partial list
of killings in El Salvador since President Alfredo Cristiani took
office on June 1.
   _ June 9: Antonio Rodriguez Porth, a conservative ideologist and
aide to Cristiani, is slain by unidentified assassins.
   _ June 26: Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the
guerrilla group that has been fighting the government for 10 years,
kills Fire Chief Col. Roberto Armando Rivera, accusing him of
belonging to rightist death squads.
   _ June 30: Edgar Chacon, founder of the right-wing Institute of
International Relations, is killed by unidentified assailants.
   _ Oct. 10: Unidentified assailants shoot to death Edelmira
Fuentes and her son Luis as they ride in a family car. Mrs. Fuentes
was the wife of Luis Fuentes, a rightist journalist. The car was
usually driven by their other son, army Lt. Mario Fuentes, and
there is speculation he was the target.
   _ Oct. 17: Isabel Casanova, daughter of Army Col. Oscar
Casanova, is killed. An anonymous caller claims responsibility for
the guerrillas, but the FMLN denies it and says the murder is the
work of rightists who want to destroy peace efforts.
   _ Oct. 31: An explosion rips through the headquarters of the
National Federation of Salvadoran Workers, killing 10 union leaders
and wounding another 29. The FMLN accuses the military of
involvement.
   _ Nov. 16: Six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her
daughter are killed and mutilated during the worst fighting in the
civil war. The priests included the rector and vice-rector of the
Central American University, one of the most prestigious
educational institutions in the region.

   Mangled cars with bodies inside. The sound of
life from an infant feared dead. And the fear, the prayer for
safety.
   Those were the recollections of 25-year-old medical student Mark
Westfall in the aftermath of the tornado that killed 17 people and
injured hundreds in Huntsville, Ala., part of a powerful storm
system that killed at least 10 other people over the last two days
in eastern states.
   Westfall, of Dalton in northern Georgia, watched the killer
tornado roar in front of his car, got out and began trying to help
victims on Wednesday night.
   ``A man was lying in the highway. He was dead. Two women in
separate cars were also dead,'' Westfall said. ``I felt their
pulses, and then we started looking in other cars, thinking maybe
we could locate those who needed the quickest attention.''
   In one car, Westfall discovered a dead woman and a baby on the
ground still strapped in her baby seat.
   ``My first impression was that she was dead, and then I heard
her cough,'' Westfall said. ``I picked her up and carried her to a
nearby house and asked the lady there to please call an ambulance.
About that time, a policeman drove up and I carried the baby to
him.''
   Westfall said that it took ambulances about 30 minutes to get to
the scene through the debris and wrecked cars. A policeman gave him
a flashlight to help him look for victims.
   ``An 18-year-old girl was trapped in her upside-down car, pinned
between two pickups that had been blown against her vehicle,'' he
said. ``I talked to her through the bottom of the car and believed
she was all right, and she seemed a little more calm.''
   Westfall said the storm passed just ahead of him.
   ``I pulled up at the traffic light, had a window down and
suddenly heard what I thought was hail pounding the car. It began
to shake violently. I raised the window and when I did, the
pressure blew it out and the glass onto me. Gravel and pine cones
were blown into the car,'' Westfall said.
   He flung himself down on the seat at about the same time the
hatchback window was blown from the rear into the car.
   ``For a few moments I thought I would not make it, and I began
praying,'' he said. ``When I raised myself up, I saw the funnel
cloud moving across the highway in front of me. I couldn't believe
what was happening. I was scared to death.''
   His only injury was a small cut on the head.

<HEAD>Brazil Conservative Has Lead, but Left Talks of Unity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Fernando Collor de Mello
took a strong lead in the initial round of Brazil's first free
presidential vote since 1960, but two leftist rivals vowed to join
forces against him in a runoff.
   Partial returns from Wednesday's voting indicated that Collor de
Mello would fall short of capturing the majority he would need to
avoid a second round of balloting against the runner-up.
   The solid showing by the left raised the possibility of a
leftist victory in a runoff, which would be held Dec. 17.
   Wednesday's balloting marked the return of full democratic
rights after 21 years of military rule. About 82 million Brazilians
voted and Brazil's Superior Electoral Court said the count will not
be completed until Saturday.
   As of Thursday night, Collor de Mello led with 27 percent of the
vote. Radical leftist Rep. Luis Inacio Lula da Silva was second
with 17 percent. Populist Leonel Brizola, another leftist, followed
with 16 percent.
   Those numbers were based on 21 percent of the vote.
   However, a large number of votes from Brizola strongholds in the
heavily populated South had not been counted, the Electoral Court
said in a statement.
   An unofficial tally by Brazil's largest TV network, Globo TV,
also gave Collor de Mello 27 percent.
   But it put Brizola, of the center-left Democratic Labor Party,
in second with 18 percent of the vote and da Silva, of the
Marxist-oriented Workers' Party, in third with 16 percent.
   Sen. Mario Covas of the left-of-center Brazilian Social
Democracy Party had 12 percent of the ballots.
   The network said its tallies were based on 60 percent of the
vote.
   Brizola and da Silva promised to join forces to battle Collor de
Mello in a runoff.
   ``We have to forget our differences and unite. If the people's
choice falls on Lula, I will be the first to campaign for him to
defeat the right,'' Brizola said Thursday at a news conference.
   Da Silva said his party would form alliances with ``whichever
progressive force goes to the second round.''
   ``All the different points of view between us, Brizola and Covas
are minor when compared with our differences with Collor de
Mello,'' da Silva, a 44-year-old former union leader, said at a
press conference in Sao Paulo.
   Collor de Mello refused comment until all the votes were counted.
   The left's strong showing and the prospect of it winning a
runoff shook financial markets in Rio and Sao Paulo, Brazil's
biggest city.
   Panicky investors rushed to buy gold and dollars. The black
market dollar rate soared 10 percent Thursday afternoon to 14
Brazilian cruzados to the dollar.
   The new president will succeed Jose Sarney, a civilian who
gained office in 1985 through an electoral college vote supervised
by the military. The winner of the new presidential election will
serve a five-year term.
   In Washington on Thursday, the State Department said it was ``a
truly significant day'' for Brazil. Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said, ``In considering the spread of democracy into other regions
such as Eastern Europe, we should also take note of what occurred
in Brazil yesterday.''
   Brazil's last free presidential election was in 1960, when Janio
Quadros won. Quadros quit after seven months and threw the nation
into a political crisis that ended with a 1964 military coup.
   After Wednesday's vote, Brizola criticized the slow vote
counting by the Electoral Court and spoke of possible fraud by
Globo TV. Its owner, media tycoon Roberto Marinho, is backing
Collor de Mello.
   Brizola sent a formal complaint to the Court asking it to bar
the network's round-the-clock election tallies. A decision on the
complaint was expected today.
   Collor de Mello campaigned on a clean-government platform that
appealed to many poor Brazilians.
   The 40-year-old former governor of the tiny northeastern state
of Alagoas has called Sarney corrupt and incompetent and has blamed
him for Brazil's 1,300 percent annual inflation. Sarney, who by law
cannot run for re-election, said he will sue for slander.

   This year's presidential turkey will escape
the oven, but not the Frying Pan.
   The Frying Pan Park petting farm in Fairfax County, Va., that is.
   The 50-pound bird, donated by the National Turkey Federation,
dined on grains prepared by a chef at a hotel blocks from the White
House on the eve of today's presentation to President Bush at a
Rose Garden ceremony.
   The turkey and its understudy were two of about 15 to 20 birds
picked out of a flock raised in Detroit Lakes in northwest
Minnesota. They were isolated from 5,000 other turkeys so they
could be pampered in preparation for their ``photo opportunity''
with the president.
   ``This year we're expecting something that's just a little bit
different,'' said Eddie Aldrete, a spokesman for the turkey
federation in Washington. ``It will be a little more ceremonial
because the Bush family is very, very traditional, and they're big
turkey lovers.''
   The Bushes will donate the Broadbreasted White turkeys to the
Frying Pan Park, a petting farm which has horses, cows, pigs,
sheep, chickens, ducks, goats and peacocks _ but no turkeys yet.

   Business stinks for Tom Boughner. But the
man who runs ``Skunkbusters'' wouldn't have it any other way.
   ``It started out kind of as a big joke,'' Boughner, a former
sheriff's deputy in Otsego County in northern Michigan, said of his
family business. ``We were having big problems with them here.''
   When Boughner found out the Department of Natural Resources
doesn't make skunk calls, he decided he would do it. At first he
picked up the skunks for free.
   ``It started more or less as a community service, helping people
who couldn't get help anywhere else,'' he said.
   In four years, Boughner estimates, he's removed as many as 100
skunks from beneath houses, inside barns and a variety of other
places. Once he evicted 17 skunks from the yard of a lawyer.
   Another time he had to shove _ from the front, of course _ a
skunk stuck in a basement window.
   He claims he has never been sprayed, although his traps
certainly have. Even so, he reserves a special pair of overalls and
an otter-skin hat for the task.

<HEAD>NRC Makes Move That Could Speed Up Seabrook Licensing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant is
nearing the end of its long regulatory journey.
   Friends and foes of the $6.3 billion plant agreed Thursday that
a decision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to take over all
pending issues confronting the plant will speed it toward a
full-power operating license.
   If the NRC, as expected, awards Seabrook a license, the federal
courts would be the last forum for opponents to fight the plant
opening.
   On Thursday the NRC took out of the hands of the Atomic Safety
and Licensing Appeal Board the issue of whether emergency
evacuation plans for New Hampshire residents near the plant are
adequate. The commission said it would decide those issues and then
proceed with its final review.
   ``It certainly speeds up the final outcome, whatever that is,''
said Rick Bornemann, spokesman for United Illuminating Corp., which
owns the second-largest share of the Seabrook plant.
   Plant spokesman Rob Williams said, ``We feel that the commission
will be in a position to issue the license around the end of the
year.''
   Opponents of Seabrook, meanwhile, reacted angrily to the NRC
decision.
   ``I am absolutely outraged by its action this morning,'' Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass., said. ``I will ask for a speed-up of the
congressional investigation of NRC procedures that we called for
this week.''

<NOTE>Ex-Packing House Worker Says Chickens Slaughtered under Filthy</NOTE>

   Conditions

   Conditions in the poultry industry amount to
``modern slavery,'' a former chicken eviscerator told a House panel
in describing a daily routine of filth and harassment at a North
Carolina packing plant.
   ``The floors regularly are covered with grease, fat, sand and
roaches. Bugs are up and down the sides of the walls,'' Donna
Bazemore said in testimony submitted Thursday to the House
Education and Labor subcommittee on labor-management relations.
``Employees are constantly chewing and spitting out snuff and
tobacco on the floor.''
   ``Chickens regularly fall off the line and into all the muck on
the floor,'' she said in prepared remarks. ``The supervisors have
workers put them back on the line.''
   Bazemore, a former worker at a Perdue Industries poultry plant
in North Carolina, was in a car accident Wednesday and could not
appear before the subcommittee, said her attorney, Tom Devine.
   The subcommittee is considering legislation to standardize the
treatment and protection of whistleblowers.
   Perdue Farms, headquartered in Salisbury, Md., responded by
issuing a press release calling the allegations ``outrageous'' and
labeling Bazemore ``less than a model employee.''
   Thomas R. Moyers, Perdue's vice president of human resources,
urged Congress and the media to contact Agriculture and
Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials ``and ask
them if they would allow any poultry plant to function under the
conditions Ms. Bazemore described.''

<HEAD>Most Women Have Had Pap Tests, But Younger Women Get Them More Often</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Older women were less likely than younger women
to have had a Pap test for cervical cancer in the past year, even
though the risk of the disease increases with age, the national
Centers for Disease Control reported.
   A study of women in 15 states showed that 98.8 percent of the
women had undergone at least one Pap test, and 72 percent had
undergone one within the previous year.
   Eighty-one percent of the women aged 18 to 39 had taken a Pap
test in the preceding year, the CDC said, compared to just 67
percent of those 40-59 and 52 percent of those 60 and older.
   ``Although ... cervical cancer incidence and mortality increase
with age, Pap smear screening decreases with age,'' the
Atlanta-based CDC said. ``Therefore, improving cervical cancer
screening among older women should be emphasized.''
   The American Cancer Society recommends annual Pap tests
beginning with the onset of sexual activity, although after three
negative tests a woman's physician may recommend less frequent
testing.
   More black women than white women had undergone a Pap test in
the preceding year, by a margin of 82 percent to 71 percent, but
the cervical cancer rate for black women was twice that of white
women in 1986, the last year for which data were available.
   ``Medical care delivery to underserved populations may be an
especially challenging problem, since screening is only one of
several key components to prevention,'' the CDC said. ``Other
factors influencing incidence and mortality trends include prompt
notification of pap smear results, adequate patient follow-up, and
appropriate treatment.''
   Higher-income women were more likely to get annual tests.
Seventy-five percent of those making more than $20,000 a year had
had Pap tests in the preceding 12 months, compared to 65 percent of
those making under $10,000.
   Cervical cancer, which kills about 5,000 U.S. women each year,
can be prevented with early detection and treatment.
   Taken in 1988, the survey was conducted with 8,741 women in 15
states: California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Nebraska,
New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
South Carolina, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin, plus the
District of Columbia.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel To Delay Frank Probe Until Penthouse Interview Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ethics Committee will delay its
investigation of Rep. Barney Frank, who has admitted paying for the
services of a male prostitute, until early next year, according to
a published report.
   The panel is postponing its probe to allow members to see what
male prostitute Stephen Gobie told Penthouse magazine in an
interview scheduled to be published in February, committee sources
told the Washington Times in a story in today's editions.
   Frank, an admitted homosexual, has admitted paying Gobie $80 for
sex in 1985 and subsequently hiring him with personal money to
serve as a housekeeper and driver from July 1985 through August
1987.
   Gobie went public with the relationship this past August, and
has said the congressman knew he was running a prostitution ring
from Frank's Capitol Hill apartment. Gobie also has accused the
Massachusetts Democrat of engaging in sex in the House gymnasium.
Frank has denied the charges.
   Originally the ethics panel hoped to complete its investigation
of Frank by the end of the year, but news reports that Gobie plans
a ``graphic'' story in the sex-oriented Penthouse magazine have
changed some minds on the panel, the committee source told The
Times.
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department has begun a ``preliminary
investigation'' into Frank, law enforcement sources said.
   ``We are not yet investigating any possible illegal activities
on the part of Mr. Frank,'' said the Justice Department official,
who requested anonymity. ``We have opened a file; that's all I can
tell you.'' The file on Frank includes news reports and other
public documents about Frank's activities, the source said.

repair job on the span that was damaged in the Oct. 17 earthquake.
   Singer Tony Bennett belted out ``I Left My Heart in San
Francisco'' at the close of an open party on the bridge Thursday,
but changed the line about ``coming home to you, San Francisco,''
to make it ``Oakland-San Francisco.''
   The ceremony featured speeches by Gov. Deukmejian, San Francisco
Mayor Art Agnos and Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson, lauding the repair
job on the 53-year-old bridge, which took exactly one month.
   Deukmejian called the bridge's reopening ``the first major event
of the rebuilding process'' for Northern California, which was
struck by a 7.1 magnitude quake that killed 66 people and caused $7
billion in damage.
   The politicians spoke from a stand just a few yards from the
spot where the temblor sent one end of a 50-foot section of the
bridge's upper deck plunging onto the lower deck. One person died
when the car she was in fell into the gap.
   Thousands of people walked from both ends of the bridge to the
ceremony but stopped short of the damaged section, where some minor
work remained to be done.
   Wilson jokingly reminded Agnos that he was ``sitting in Oakland
now;'' the break was on the Alameda County side of the bridge. The
two mayors had carried on a keen rivalry during the World Series
between the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants. The
series, symbolized by the bridge on T-shirts and other items, was
interrupted by the temblor.
   Those who marched on the bridge from San Francisco included
Susan Palumbo, 42, who was in a bus on the bridge when the
earthquake hit.
   ``I didn't feel the quake, but it was scary because we were
waiting for an aftershock to take the bridge down,'' said Palumbo.
   Meanwhile, a panel of engineers said the repairs have made the
bridge as strong as it was before the Oct. 17 temblor, but said
that another, similar quake would seriously damage the span.
   ``Mother Nature performed an experiment that showed (the bridge)
was not designed adequately,'' said geologist Robert E. Wallace,
chairman of the Bay Conservation and Development Commission's
Engineering Criteria Review Board.
   ``It failed in a very distant earthquake,'' he said. The
epicenter of the quake was in the Santa Cruz Mountains about 70
miles to the south.
   The bridge, one of the most-traveled in the world, carried an
average of more than 260,000 vehicles every work day before the
quake.
   In the past month, commuters who normally drove the bridge to
work had to travel longer, slower alternate routes or use mass
transit.

   U.S. clergy decried the murder of six Jesuit priests in El
Salvador as an unspeakable atrocity, with the National Council of
Churches urging Congress to halt delivery of military aid to El
Salvador.
   ``We fear for the lives of our brothers,'' said the Rev. Joseph
Berra, a fellow member of the Roman Catholic order who knew the
victims and worked in San Salvador before moving to Texas in August.
   The Bush administration, readying a new shipment of arms to
confront a rebel offensive, said it will press for an
investigation, and congressmen are threatening cuts in military aid
unless the murderers are brought to justice.
   ``If the government does not bring to justice those responsible,
we would have no choice but to try to severely limit Salvadoran aid
next year,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over foreign aid.
   William Walker, U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, called the
slayings ``a barbaric act,'' and compared them to the 1980 killings
of three nuns and a laywoman. Five former Salvadoran national
guardsmen were convicted of those killings.
   ``It is obviously going to have a negative impact on the
government of El Salvador,'' Walker said.
   The Salvadoran government denied responsibility and condemned
the slayings as ``savage and irrational.'' President Alfredo
Cristiani said he had ordered an investigation.
   In Austin, Texas, Berra held a news conference with two other
Jesuits who also worked in San Salvador before coming to the
University of Texas.
   The Rev. Doug Marcouiller said fellow Jesuits in El Salvador
told him 30 armed, uniformed men carried out the killings.
   ``Their bodies were riddled with bullets, and their heads had
been smashed,'' he said. ``This while an attachment of 80 soldiers
was encamped about 100 yards away.''
   Marcouiller said the Jesuits had been denounced ``as sources of
subversion'' on Salvadoran radio and subjected to threats. The
Jesuits' house was bombed, but no one was killed.
   The extreme right, now in power, has for more than a decade
accused local Jesuits and their university of fostering subversive
ideology.
   The National Council of Churches' governing board, holding its
semiannual meeting in Pittsburgh, unanimously approved a resolution
urging the Bush administration to halt military aid to El Salvador
and do everything possible to end the 10-year-old civil war there.
   ``We certainly hope the action we have taken will help prevent
further atrocities happening there,'' said the Rev. Syngman Rhee,
installed Thursday night as the council's president-elect.
   The resolution also calls on El Salvador's government and rebel
forces to protect civilians and cooperate with humanitarian
agencies, and asks that churches and religious groups have
unrestricted access to endangered civilians.
   The council, America's largest ecumenical body comprising 32
denominations with a combined membership of 42 million Christians,
including most major Protestant denominations, also advised members
to be ready to provide emergency aid to churches in El Salvador.
   Seattle Roman Catholic Archbishop Raymond G. Hunthausen called
the killings ``an unspeakable atrocity,'' and urged an end to U.S.
military aid to El Salvador.
   About 75 people gathered near the Salvadoran consulate in
Chicago Thursday evening, some carrying white crosses bearing the
names of those killed, while the Rev. Raymond Baumhart, president
of Jesuit-run Loyola University, said the school was ``stunned'' by
the deaths.
   ``These are men who dedicated their lives to service of others;
they committed themselves to living and serving the poor and the
uneducated; they ministered to men and women who suffered the
effects of the war in San Salvador,'' Baumhart said. ``We pray that
they will not have died in vain.''
   Baumhart noted that one of the slain priests _ the Rev. Ignacio
Ellacuria, rector of Jose Simeon Canas Central American University
_ received an honorary doctorate from Loyola in 1986.
   The Rev. Thomas Schubeck, professor of religious studies at
Cleveland's Jesuit-run John Carroll University, interviewed
Ellacuria in April for a book on liberation theology. He said the
Jesuits' work on behalf of the poor made them targets for the right.
   ``They've removed a number of important educators, good thinkers
who stood for people,'' he said. ``It was a vengeful kind of
execution.''
   The dead included Ellacuria; university vice-rector Ignacio
Martin-Baro; the Revs. Segundo Montes, Amado Lopez, Juan Ramon
Moreno and Joaquin Lopez Lopez; their housekeeper, Julia Elba
Ramos, and her 15-year-old daughter Celina.
   Late Thursday, uniformed security officers raided a downtown
office of the Lutheran Church and arrested 12 foreigners, including
four U.S. citizens, who work with the church, said Michel Gagne, a
consular officer in the Canadian Embassy.

<HEAD>California Assemblywoman Refused Communion For Abortion Stand</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An assemblywoman banned from receiving
communion because of her public advocacy of abortion rights says
she is troubled by the sanction but will not change her pro-choice
position.
   ``I knew that I was not in agreement with the church hierarchy,
but I thought it all through a long time ago,'' assemblwoman Lucy
Kilea said Thursday. ``I felt comfortable with it. Intellectually,
spiritually and emotionally, that's where I wanted to be.''
   Bishop Leo T. Maher took the action Wednesday, one day after
Killea began running a series of pro-choice television
advertisements as part of her campaign for a state senate seat.
   It is believed to be the first such sanction imposed on a
Catholic elected official in the United States since a gathering of
bishops last week in Baltimore agreed to intensify the church's
anti-abortion stand, said Frances Kissling, who heads the
Washington-based Catholics for a Free Choice.
   ``The bishops have been sorely stung by the large number of
Catholic politicians who publicly disagree with them on the
question of abortion,'' Kissling said. ``And, as is typical, they
have chosen to make their first example a woman.''
   Though his authority is limited to his local diocese, Maher said
his sanction will prevent Killea from receiving communion
``wherever she goes.''
   ``We're doing this because the politicians have failed to
recognize their obligation to bring their Catholic faith and
morality into the public arena,'' he said Thursday.
   Killea, a Democrat, is running against Republican Assemblywoman
Carol Bentley in a special election scheduled Dec. 5.
   Killea said she would continue going to Mass regularly, but
would abide by Maher's order and not take communion.
   ``I was surprised at the punitive nature of actually taking
action against me,'' she said. ``But as he is the bishop ... I'll
respect his authority and I won't receive communion when I go to
Mass.''
   Maher denied that Killea was unfairly singled out.
   ``No Catholic can responsibly take a pro-choice stand when the
choice in question involves the taking of a human life,'' he said.
``The right to life is a fundamental right. Without it, there are
no other rights.''
   Killea consistently has voted for abortion rights legislation
since her 1982 election to the Assembly, but has not been
particularly outspoken on the subject until the current campaign.

<TEXT>
   The main index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed
at a record high today for the fifth straight day, while the dollar
inched up against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which rose
24.11 points Thursday, added another 87.40 points, or 0.24 percent,
closing the week at 35,963.74.
   The dollar closed at 143.98 yen, up 0.13 yen from Thursday's
close of 143.85 yen. After opening at 144.17 yen, the U.S. currency
ranged between 143.95 and 144.25 yen.
   ``The dollar stayed in a narrow range, attracting generally
bullish sentiment in the market,'' said Shinji Tanaka, a dealer
with Mitsui Bank.
   A rumor that Japan's central bank would raise its official
discount rate resulted in some temporary dollar-selling pressure,
but the currency bounced back in the afternoon session as the rumor
proved to be groundless, Tanaka said.
   In the stock market, the Nikkei index continued to rise, with
investors buying a broad range of issues, securities dealers said.
   An estimated 900 million shares changed hands on the market's
first section, down from Thursday's 1.1 billion shares.
   During the past five trading days, the index has gained a total
of 300.54 points.
   ``A glut of money in Japan is contributing to the booming stock
market,'' said Masahiko Fujia, a stock analyst at Yamaichi
Securities, a major Japanese brokerage.
   Fujita said some of the surplus funds were flowing into the
stock market from the short-term money market, where interest rates
have been higher than in the long-term market in recent days and
are expected to possibly decline.
   The Tokyo market also was awaiting the release of the U.S.
wholesale price index for October, scheduled next Tuesday, he said.

   The Foreign Ministry is searching for the nieces or nephews of

   Authorities seized nearly 5,000 pounds
of cocaine and arrested five Venezuelans and Colombians in the
largest cocaine bust in the nation's history, officials said.
   The cocaine, which was confiscated by national guard troops, was
being stored in trucks near Valencia, about 100 miles west of
Caracas, guard spokesman Col. Gerardo Marquez said Thursday.
   Along with the estimated 4,840 pounds of cocaine, the national
guard also confiscated $17,380 from the suspects during Wednesday's
raid.
   The identities of the suspects were not released. Marquez said
authorities believe they are linked to Colombian drug cartel
operations.
   Venezuela and neighboring countries have been increasingly used
as alternative smuggling routes for the Colombian cartels since
Colombian authorities launched a U.S.-backed crackdown in August.

<TEXT>
   A man convicted of raping and murdering his
cousin while he was on a brief leave from prison was put to death
in the electric chair this morning, 11 years after the crime.
   Arthur James Julius gave two thumbs up and waved both hands,
nodding in the direction of his brother, Clarence Byrd, and prison
chaplain Robert Simmons, before being executed at 12:09 a.m.
   Julius, 43, of Birmingham, was sentenced to death for the 1978
rape and killing of his cousin, 29-year-old Susie Bell Sanders, at
her Montgomery apartment.
   In his final words, Julius said ``he held no ill feeling toward
the warden or the two lieutenants that were in the execution
area,'' Holman Prison commissioner Morris Thigpen said. ``He
understood they had a job to do and did not hold it against them.''
   Thigpen further quoted Julius as saying ``he believed in God and
knew he would not let him suffer.''
   Julius had pinned a purple ribbon on the shirt of his white
sweatsuit. Prison officials said the ribbon is worn by death row
inmates to protest the death penalty.
   He was the fourth inmate to die in Alabama's electric chair this
year and the 119th person put to death in the United States since
the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states to resume use of
the death penalty.
   Julius had lost an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court about eight
hours before the execution.
   The high court refused by a 7-2 vote late Thursday afternoon to
spare Julius' life. Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall, who oppose capital punishment in all circumstances,
supported Julius' emergency plea for a stay of execution.
   Julius was serving a life term for a 1972 Jefferson County
murder when he was released on a pass from a prison work-release
center near Montgomery.
   According to court records, Julius left on an 8-hour pass at 11
a.m. on Jan. 29, 1978, and borrowed a relative's car from 3:30 p.m.
to 6:25 p.m. During that time, Julius turned Ms. Sanders' apartment
into a shambles, beating her and dragging her through rooms and
subjecting her to ``grotesque sexual abuse'' before strangling her.
   Ms. Sander's body was discovered by her 5-year-old daughter.
   The victim's parents told reporters in January that the
execution was long overdue. Her father has since died. Family
members declined comment when contacted by phone this week.

   A radio announcer chattered away
until he was cut off in mid-sentence. A few moments later, he was
back on the air with an apology: ``Sorry folks, it's a brownout.''
   Power outages are nothing new for Manila's 7 million
inhabitants. But since October, they have occurred daily, fraying
the nerves of residents, who also must cope with rising crime,
horrific traffic and uncollected garbage.
   Some officials and newspaper commentators say the brownouts also
are threatening the economy.
   When the electricity problem worsened last month, President
Corazon Aquino ordered the state-run National Power Corp. to ``end
the brownouts.''
   But the corporation, which generates power for sale to private
distributors, announced Thursday that brownouts will increase
because of the deplorable state of the Luzon island electricity
network.
   Until Nov. 26, electricity will be cut three times a day for two
hours at a time. After that, selective cuts will continue until at
least the end of the year, the corporation said.
   The prospect does not include unscheduled power failures caused
by faulty equipment or system overloads.
   Pat Gutierrez, spokeswoman for the National Power Corp., blames
the problem on low water levels this year at hydroelectric plants
and damage suffered by major power plants during recent typhoons.
   However, critics also fault the government for neglecting the
Luzon power system since the final years of the late President
Ferdinand Marcos' administration.
   ``We are now suffering the cumulative effect of neglect, poor
management, poor planning and deferred maintenance over the last
six years,'' said Sen. John Osmena.
   The power cuts come without warning. In one building near Manila
Bay, office workers rush to the elevator shaft during brownouts to
check if anyone has been trapped inside the elevator.
   Brownouts also snarl the already tenuous operations of the
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. and halt pumps that deliver
water to many buildings.
   ``The continuing brownouts have reached national emergency
proportions,'' complained the newspaper Tempo. ``It is wreaking
havoc on every facet of Philippine life.''
   Private companies that own their own generators can cope. But
many companies and government agencies simply close when brownouts
occur in the afternoon.
   Workers who leave early often find themselves bogged down for
hours in monstrous traffic jams because traffic lights also are
turned off.
   One official at the Department of Education, speaking on
condition of anonymity, sometimes takes a long siesta during the
brownouts.
   ``I'm lucky because my desk is near the window, and I can still
work,'' she said. ``Everybody else just sleeps.''
   No official figures are available on how the power crisis is
affecting the economy. But Anneli Lagman, supervising specialist at
the National Economic Development Authority, said ``production will
definitely be affected'' in the last quarter of this year.
   ``Industrial output is down 15 percent due to the long power
shortage,'' said The Manila Standard. It did not provide a source
for the figure.
   ``So much for the economic recovery or President Aquino's
pronouncement ... about the country being an `investment haven,'''
the newspaper said.
   Mrs. Aquino has been trying to lure foreign investment with such
statements.
   Sport events also have been disrupted by the brownouts.
   Several games in the Maharlika Cup tournament of the Philippine
Amateur Basketball League have been rescheduled because the lights
went out during play.
   ``One can just imagine the tens of millions of pesos lost in
terms of wasted man-hours because of the daily brownouts,''
complained columnnist Art Borjal in the Philippine Daily Star.
   ``Computers conk out, factories stop humming, classes are
suspended, traffic flow goes awry and people can only cry and curse
why the Dark Ages have returned to a place that's supposed to be
the country's capital region.''
   Among other things, Sen. Osmena called for foregoing the garish
Christmas lights strung up in suburban Makati. So far, city
officials have refused but have urged individuals to conserve power
by cutting back on Christmas lights at home.
   People have begun to joke about dreaming of a ``black
Christmas'' in Asia's only predominantly Christian country.

   A small boy who nearly drowned in
his family's backyard Jacuzzi in January died after a second
accident in which he fell into the family pool.
   Charles Jacob Greenlees, 2, was found floating in the pool
Wednesday by a baby sitter.
   The boy had been left alone for about five minutes and toddled
across the fenced front yard of his home, opened a screen-door
latch to the rear patio and fell in the pool.
   An hour later, he was pronounced dead at Martin Memorial
Hospital, about 140 miles north of Miami, despite efforts by his
baby sitter and rescue squads to revive him.
   In January, the child had been saved when his mother, Sharon
Greenlees, gave him cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Greenlees, who teaches CPR for the American Heart Association,
said after the close call that she hoped her the near-tragedy would
encourage all parents to take CPR training.

   Hungary has become the first East
European country to apply for membership in the Council of Europe,
a Western European political organization.
   Yugoslavia and Poland also indicated they would apply.
   Hungary applied for membership Thursday. Foreign Minister Gyula
Horn said membership would provide ``a very good basis that will
enable us in the near future to enter into close cooperation with
the European Community.''
   The 12 nations belonging to the European Community trading bloc
also are members of the Council of Europe, but the organizations
are not formally linked.
   Horn, who met Thursday with foreign ministers attending a
regular meeting of the council in Strasbourg, said he hoped that
Hungary ``might even become a member of the European Community.''
   He said he expected his country to join the Council of Europe
``within six to nine months, or at all events in 1990.''
   Catherine Lalumiere, secretary-general of the 23-nation Council
of Europe, said if Hungary maintains its pace of political reform,
it could become the organization's first East European member in a
year or so.
   Set up in 1949, the Strasbourg-based council is particularly
active on the issues of human rights and legal and cultural
cooperation.
   Horn said membership would not be incompatible with Hungary's
position in the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet-led military alliance.
   ``We don't want to break away from that alliance or even want to
call our membership of that alliance into question,'' Horn said.
   Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar of Yugoslavia said he had
outlined his nation's reforms to the council.
   Asked if Belgrade planned to apply for membership next spring,
he replied, ``It will most likely be as you predict.''
   Poland's foreign minister, Krzysztof Skubiszewski, said,
``Poland has the intention to apply, but we did not file any formal
demand today.''
   He said it was difficult to say when Poland could seek
membership, addding,``I think it's too early for us to do it.''
   Membership is open only to European countries with democratic,
multiparty parliaments.
   Hungary plans multiparty elections for next year. In August,
Poland formed the East Bloc's first government led by a
non-Communist since they consolidated power in Eastern Europe after
World War II.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev indicated in
remarks published today that multiparty government might someday
come to the Soviet Union, but he ruled out private ownership of
farms and factories.
   The Soviet leader rejected current calls for allowing political
parties other than the ruling Communist Party.
   The official news agency Tass quoted him as saying there was
``no other political force capable of both renewing the bodies of
Soviet power ... and consolidating society.''
   However, he also said any constitutional provision, including
the article giving the Communist Party the leading role in shaping
Soviet society, ``may be subjected to a reassessment,
transformation and editing, if the need arises, even to its
deletion from the constitution.''
   The East bloc has been swept by a wave of political reform this
year.
   Poland formed a government led by a non-Communist in August and
Hungary plans to switch to multiparty rule after elections next
year. East Germany and Bulgaria appear to be undertaking more
limited reforms.
   Gorbachev's remarks were made Wednesday during a
question-and-answer session that followed a speech to a national
forum of students. The speech was broadcast Wednesday night on
official media, and the question-and-answer session late Thursday.
   The president said he was open to ``a large variety of different
forms of running the economy which would, through lease,
cooperation, individual farms, etcetera, make the individual the
master'' with authority to manage the means of production.
   However, Gorbachev said that although many changes are possible
in the era of perestroika, he remained committed to the Marxist
concept that the state should own the means of production.
   He said he believed in the Communist Manifesto, which calls for
state ownership of production to ensure that workers get full value
for their effort without factory owners taking a share as profit.
   The Manifesto was written in 1848 by Karl Marx and Friedrich
Engels as the blueprint for communism.
   The Soviet legislature is currently debating bills to define
various forms of property, including proposals that would permit
private ownership of some property and long-term leasing of state
farms and industry.
   ``I do not think that at the stage of preparing a law on
property and ownership we should put forth and lay down the
advancement toward private property,'' Gorbachev told the students.
   Addressing international issues, Gorbachev said German
reunification was hardly realistic today, but ``as to how history
will turn out in the future, we will live and see.''
   Gorbachev and Soviet spokesmen have previously expressed strong
opposition to any possibility of reunification of East Germany and
West Germany.
   There has been speculation about reunification since East German
leaders opened their borders to the West earlier this month in
response to street protests for reform and the exodus of citizens
to the West.

<HEAD>Snow Blankets Midwest; Temperatures Drop in East, South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell in the Midwest early today, hours after a powerful
storm system brought strong winds and heavy thunderstorms to the
Northeast.
   Violent storms Thursday caused widespread wind damage and
flooding in the Northeast and claimed the lives of seven children
when a wall collapsed on a school cafeteria near Newburgh, N.Y.
There were three other weather-related deaths Thursday in New
Jersey and New York.
   Storms knocked over trees and ripped roofs off houses in West
Virginia, caused flooding in Washington, D.C., blew the windows out
of skyscrapers in Philadelphia, destroyed a house in Piscataway,
N.J., and overturned cars and blew the roof off a shopping mall in
Quebec.
   There were reports of damage from strong thunderstorms and gusty
winds in eastern Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, eastern
Pennsylvania and eastern New York state. Winds gusted to 65 mph in
Baltimore, 76 mph in Lancaster, Pa., and 100 mph in Philadelphia.
   Tornadoes touched down at King of Prussia, Pa., Lakehurst, N.J.,
and Peekskill, N.Y.
   Temperatures dropped into the 20s and 30s throughout the Midwest
as snow fell in North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan
today. Rain out West dampened parts of Oregon and Washington.
   Colder weather also extended into the South, with temperatures
in north and middle Georgia dropping into into the 20s today.
Workers at homeless shelters across the state prepared for a busy
weekend.
   More than a foot of snow fell Thursday over parts of northeast
and south-central upper Michigan, including 14 inches at Marquette.
   Snow also fell Thursday evening over southeast Minnesota,
northern and western Wisconsin, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee,
northeast Alabama, western North Carolina, western Virginia, West
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and western New York.
   The high temperature for the nation Thursday was 90 degrees in
Miami and in California at Borrego Springs, Palm Springs and
Thermal.

<HEAD>Controversial Exhibit Opens _ With $10,000 Federal Grant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizers hailed a last-minute decision by the
National Endowment for the Arts to fund an art exhibit on the AIDS
epidemic as a split decision in favor of free expression.
   NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer, who earlier this month had
rescinded a $10,000 grant awarded in May, said Thursday that he
would release the grant.
   The exhibit at the Artists Space gallery features paintings,
photographs and sculpture by 23 artists, and contains several
explicit depictions of male genitals and controversial religious
images.
   Frohnmayer had disputed the program's catalog, which includes
derogatory references to Cardinal John J. O'Connor, Roman Catholic
archbishop of New York, and to lawmakers who supported a bill
restricting funding of art considered obscene.
   But after seeing the exhibit, he relented.
   ``After consulting with members of the National Council on the
Arts, several of whom have also seen the show, I have agreed to
approve the request of Artists Space ... and will release the grant
for the exhibition only,'' he said.
   Show organizers accepted the money but stood by the catalogue.
   ``We are pleased to accept the grant, that the show is receiving
the press attention it deserves, and the issues of free speech,
free expression, public funding for the arts, censorship and
self-censorship are becoming clear to the American public,'' said
Susan Wyatt, executive director of the gallery.
   She said Frohnmayer's decision was made possible by a
technicality _ the grant was awarded in 1989, before passage of the
bill banning grants to art deemed ``obscene.''
   ``We were unwilling to compromise, and I don't believe we as a
people should either,'' she said.
   The show, which had a total budget of $30,000, opened to the
public Thursday night.
   ``We won a battle, but the war is still on _ the war against
homophobia, AIDS phobia and any undermining of our freedom of
speech,'' said Nan Goldin, organizer of the exhibit, ``Witnesses:
Against Our Vanishing.''
   Conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein refused to accept a
National Medal of Arts in protest when the NEA indicated it would
rescind the grant, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Thursday.
   The catalog contained an essay by David Wojnarowicz, a
photographer with AIDS, which labeled O'Connor ``a fat cannibal in
a black skirt.'' He also said he fantasized about setting Helms on
fire and throwing U.S. Rep. William E. Dannemeyer off the Empire
State Building.
   Wyatt said she was honored to be associated with the essay and
said she was ``moved by its power, its truth and its beauty.''
   The exhibit was intended to show how AIDS has devastated the
arts community. It includes graphic photographs of naked men and at
least one woman, though most of the works are abstract. One
sculpture shows a Christ figure wearing lipstick and mascara.
   Last week, Frohnmayer said the show lacked ``artistic merit.''
   Several artists in the show signed a petition calling for
Frohnmayer's resignation.
   In a statement taped to the gallery walls, Goldin said, ``All
art is political by nature; there can be no personal freedom
without freedom to express oneself sexually and politically in
one's art and in one's life.''

<HEAD>Soviets Say Travel Bill Will Let Millions Go Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 6 million Soviets would visit aboard or
emigrate under a proposed law that would ease travel regulations,
compared with 2.2 million this year, a Soviet official said.
   The official commented Thursday at a news conference on a bill
making its way through the Soviet legislature. It would lift most
of the travel restrictions that Soviet citizens and international
leaders have complained about for decades.
   Soviet officials argued that the more liberal law would
encourage Soviets to stay home instead of fleeing their country as
East Germans have done.
   ``There will be no need to be reckless and go for permanent
residence abroad. First you should go and see,'' said Rudolf A.
Kuznetsov, the head of the Soviet agency that issues visas.
   ``The more democratic and liberal the exit rules, the less
people want to leave, and this is corroborated by the recent
example of the German Democratic Republic,'' said Anatoly G.
Kovalev, a first deputy foreign minister.
   He was referring to the Nov. 9 decision by East Germany's
Communist leaders, under the pressure of street protests and mass
emigration through socialist countries, to open borders to free
travel and begin reforms.
   Most East Germans who crossed into West Berlin, West Germany,
through openings in the Berlin Wall returned after a brief visit.
   Kuznetsov said 5 million to 6 million of the 287 million Soviets
are expected to emigrate or travel abroad next year. He gave no
breakdown.
   Legislator Fyodor Burlatsky said on Monday that he expects
500,000 to emigrate next year.
   By comparison, Kuznetsov said that by the end of this year,
200,000 people are expected to emigrate and 2 million to travel
abroad.
   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said in Washington the
easing of Soviet emigration laws would open the Soviet Union for
most-favored-nation trade status with the United States.
   In the past, tens of thousands of Jews and other Soviets were
refused exit visas, a policy the West repeatedly censured.
   The Soviet legislation would allow emigration for virtually
anyone who has entry permission from another country and no
outstanding alimony obligations, criminal charges or recent
knowledge of state secrets.
   It would set a limit of five years on the period a citizen can
be kept from emigrating because of access to secrets.
   Kovalev and other officials promised that emigration and foreign
travel would be barred in only very limited cases. But in an
apparent reference to the exodus from East Germany, he added that
the Kremlin was not in favor of a mass flight to the West.
   ``The Soviet state, as any other, is not interested in
stimulating the exodus of its people to foreign countries,'' he
said. ``The brain drain of talent did not strengthen any state.''
   Many of the fleeing East Germans are young and skilled.
   Kovalev bristled at a reporter's suggestion that Soviets, like
many East Germans, might become fed up with domestic economic
troubles and choose to leave. ``Each has his own reasons, and the
situation in the German Democratic Republic is quite different,''
he said.
   The officials cited several factors that might limit emigration:
the heavy workload of visa officials, immigration restrictions
imposed by other countries, the difficulty of obtaining plane
tickets to fly out of the Soviet Union and limits on the amount of
money Soviets can convert into foreign currency.

   The longtime leader of America's communists is
hewing to the party line on reforms in the Eastern bloc, portraying
them as harbingers of a stronger socialism.
   ``Socialism is going through a phase and there's some basic
changes in its nature,'' Gus Hall, 79, chief of the Communist Party
U.S.A. for 30 years, said Thursday. ``That doesn't mean socialism
is dead.''
   ``It's becoming what I would call people's socialism, socialism
in which the Communist Party is not the sole political leader and
the communist parties have to share power in building socialism,''
Hall said.
   The notion of communist power-sharing is as surprising coming
from Hall as from his counterparts in the East. Long rigid in his
ideology, Hall still expresses admiration for Joseph Stalin and
chafes at communist flirtations with private enterprise.
   But sudden and remarkable reforms have swept communist Eastern
Europe, culminating last week in East Germany's opening of the
Berlin Wall, which split communist East Berlin and democratic West
Berlin for 28 years.
   ``That's great,'' said Hall, who has supported Moscow's moves as
they ranged through the decades from crackdown to growing openness.
``I said long ago that the Berlin Wall will come down. ... I don't
think it's needed now.''
   In a telephone interview, he expressed views that diverged
sharply from his hard-line history, including support for free
elections in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. He predicted that
socialists would win them.
   ``It will result in loosening the so-called political monopoly
that the (communist) parties have had,'' he said. ``That was
necessary in the initial stages and in difficult periods of war.
But they're not necessary now and they haven't been for some time.
That's old habits.''
   Hall's view left one student of American communism unimpressed.
``Hall is obviously very upset with what's going on in the
socialist world,'' said Harvey Klehr, a political science professor
at Emory University in Atlanta.
   ``You can keep saying the communist system is reforming itself.
What's really happening is the people of those countries have
decided to abolish communism,'' said Klehr, a specialist in
American radicalism.
   ``That's tough for someone like Hall, who's been a communist all
his life, to accept _ that people who live under it can't tolerate
it.''
   During the communist scare of the early 1950s, Hall spent eight
years in federal prison at Leavenworth, Kan., for conspiring to
overthrow the government by force, a charge he rejects.
   He said the Communist Party U.S.A. has 20,000 members; Klehr
said 10,000 to 15,000 is probably closer.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher as Interest Rate Prospects Assessed, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was higher in calm European trading
this morning, with investors uncertain what direction U.S. interest
rates will take. Gold prices also were higher.
   Although traders said the dollar reacted positively Thursday to
a smaller-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in September, the
outlook for the currency was still unclear.
   ``There's no real trend,'' one analyst in Milan said.
   Traders in Frankfurt said the dollar's failure to rise
decisively underscored the market's preoccupation with interest
rates.
   Because of this, they said, today's release of U.S. housing
starts data also probably would have little impact.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.13 yen to close at 143.98 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 144.345 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.84315 West German marks, up from 1.8375
   _1.6350 Swiss francs, up from 1.6290
   _6.3000 French francs, up from 6.2550
   _2.07945 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0750
   _1,356.50 Italian lire, up from 1,354.00
   _1.1685 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1700
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.57485 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5805 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $392.25 a troy ounce,
down from late Thursday's $393.00. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of $393.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $393.00, up from $392.50 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.59 to close at a bid $392.21.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.65 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's $5.60.

   A 538-foot oil tanker crushed a 90-foot
fishing boat outside Los Angeles Harbor, injuring four fishermen
and causing a small petroleum spill, a U.S. Coast Guard official
said today.
   The fishing vessel Shogun remained afloat despite the damage
from the tanker Antarctica about two miles offshore late Thursday
night, said Petty Officer Robert Beals.
   Lifeguards from Long Beach rescued the Shogun's four-member crew
and took them to a hospital, Beals said. He said he didn't know how
badly they were injured.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation. Both vessels
were thought to be based in Long Beach, Beals said.
   The accident caused a petroleum spill about 100 yards square
that was quickly contained, he said.

   The shooting deaths of two
sixth-grade boys at the hands of a police officer has outraged
members of the Laotian immigrant community in this St. Paul suburb.
   Thia Yang and Basee Lor, both 13, were killed Wednesday by a
single blast from a 12-gauge shotgun fired by officer Kenneth
Murphy, said Mark Shields, superintendent of the state Bureau of
Criminal Apprehension.
   Shields said Murphy, 54, a 20-year-old veteran of the force,
mistook a screwdriver in the hands of one of the boys for a gun.
The boys had been pursued earlier in a stolen car, police said.
   ``Why would police shoot a young kid? Why didn't they just stop
him? Those questions weren't answered,'' said Sau Thao, a friend of
Thia Yang's family.
   ``Officer Murphy, fearing his life was in danger, discharged his
weapon,'' Shields said.
   Murphy was placed on paid administrative leave pending a grand
jury investigation, said Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom. A
special prosecutor will present the evidence, he said.
   ``My mom says she doesn't understand why they didn't just put in
him jail, why they had to kill him,'' said Blia Lor, 18-year-old
sister of Basee Lor. Her mother, who had been shot several times
while fleeing Laos, sobbed.
   ``She says why don't the police kill her instead,'' Blia Lor
said, speaking for her mother, who does not speak English.
   Minnesota has the second largest contingent of Laotians in the
United States, after California. The Hmong tribesmen began arriving
from Laos in 1975, at the close of the Vietnam war.
   Outraged Laotians have been calling Yang Vang, director of the
Lao Family Community of Minnesota, he said.
   ``They're calling because when they heard about police officer
using shotgun to kill the two kids. Members are very, very upset,''
Vang said.
   ``The officer is trained and knows how to deal with people and
he should have known how to deal with those kids not firing a
gun,'' said Ge Yang, coordinator of the Lao center's delinquency
prevention program.
   The shootings followed a brief chase by police responding to an
auto theft call, according to Shields. The pursuit continued after
the car went into a ditch and three boys fled on foot, he said.
   Murphy pursued the boys on foot through a field. He took cover
behind a hay wagon, identified himself as a police officer and
shouted at the boys, who fled. The officer saw Yang raise his hand
with what Murphy thought was a gun, Shields said.
   Murphy was about 30 yards away from Yang when he shot, and Lor
was about 15 feet behind and to the side of Yang, Shields said.
   The third boy, a 14-year-old, was arrested after the shooting,
authorities said.

<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats say they have the votes to
defeat President Bush's controversial nominee for a top natural
resources job and will prove it if Bush doesn't withdraw the
nomination.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said Thursday that he would seek a vote before Congress
recesses for the year unless Bush acts.
   Leahy, who has led the opposition to James E. Cason, said he
would like withdrawal or a promise that Bush would not appoint
Cason during the recess, an action that would circumvent the Senate
confirmation process.
   Cason, who has been a high-ranking official at the Interior
Department since 1982, was nominated to be assistant secretary of
agriculture for natural resources and soil conservation.
   Leahy and others opponents say his record at Interior showed a
preference for private development interests over environmental
concerns.
   ``James Cason would lose on the Senate floor because both
Democrats and Republicans would vote against him,'' Leahy said.
   ``The votes are not there (to confirm him),'' he said in a
speech on the Senate floor.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he was willing to
go ahead with a vote, but Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said
Thursday he wanted to wait.
   ``We totally support the nomination and have no intention of
withdrawing it,'' said Alixe Glen, White House deputy press
secretary.
   ``None of us likes to turn down a president's request for a
person for a job in his administration,'' Leahy said. ``James Cason
is the wrong man for the wrong job at the wrong time.''
   John Tower, Bush's first choice for defense secretary, is the
only nominee so far to be defeated on a floor vote. Unlike Tower,
however, Cason was approved by the committee that interviewed him.
   The Agriculture Committee voted 12-7 to send the nomination to
the floor, despite Leahy's misgivings.
   However, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., then exercised his right to
put a hold on further action because he opposed Cason.
   ``He's a James Watt clone,'' said Reid in a reference to the
former Interior secretary whose pro-development policies angered
environmentalists.
   That gave other senators more time to review Cason's record.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., the chairman of the Energy and
Commerce Committee joined Leahy in a letter to the other senators
calling on them to vote against the nominee.
   Last week, Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin became the first
Republican to oppose Cason, announcing on the floor of the Senate
his intention to vote against the nominee.
   On Tuesday, Sen. Lloyd Bentson, D-Texas, issued a statement
saying he would vote against Cason and thought the president
``should seek out another, better qualified nominee for the
position.''

<HEAD>Declaration Ending Beach Segregation Generally Praised</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of one town today
vowed to keep blacks off the local beach, but elsewhere there was
acclaim for the president's declaration that segregation of beaches
and other public amenities would end.
   ``Whites-only'' signs came down on one beach near Cape Town, and
a black consumer boycott of white-owned stores was called off in
the industrial city of Boksburg, a year after it was launched to
protest the reintroduction of segregation ordinances by the
far-right Conservative Party.
   ``Our protest had the desired effect,'' said Danny Cassels of
the Save Boksburg Committee. ``We have won the day.''
   In Mossel Bay, a town on the southern coast controlled by the
Conservatives, Mayor Johan Ooosthuizen said the local beaches would
remain whites-only as long as possible.
   But in The Strand, another coastal town in Cape Province, the
town council held a special meeting Thursday night after President
F.W. de Klerk's announcement and voted to take down their
``whites-only'' beach signs immediately. In August, police used
whips to chase anti-apartheid protesters off that beach.
   ``We are an inextricably mixed country, with blacks hugely
outnumbering whites,'' said an editorial in the Citizen, a
pro-government daily, welcoming the announcement. ``There is no way
we can unscramble the races or go on having amenities for whites
only.''
   De Klerk said Thursday that the government would repeal ``as
soon as possible'' the Separate Amenities Act of 1953, which
allowed local officials to segregate public facilities. The act
cannot be repealed before Parliament convenes in February, but the
president urged local officials to open whites-only beaches
immediately.
   Today, Provincial Affairs Minister Hernus Kriel asked the
administrators of the coastal Natal and Cape provinces to repeal
all provincial beach apartheid laws. Kriel said such a move would
overrule any local segregation ordinances and make town councils
liable for legal action if they retained whites-only beaches.
   City councilors in Durban, the largest city with segregated
beaches, are to hold an emergency meeting this weekend to decide
their course of action. But the mayor, Derek Watterson, said he
welcomed de Klerk's decision.
   The announcement also was priased by the national chamber of
commerce and tourist industry officials.
   Otto Stehlik, chief executive of the Protea hotel chain,
recalled an incident where a mixed-race accountant staying with his
family at the chain's Mossel Bay hotel had been forcibly removed
from the segregated beach. Legislation to outlaw such practices
``could not come soon enough,'' he said.
   The Separate Amenities Act has empowered white local governments
to bar blacks from parks, libraries, swimming pools, civic centers,
buses and public toilets.
   In many communities, most or all public amenities now are open
to all races. But whites-only facilities exist in the capital,
Pretoria, in many rural towns, and in several small industrial
cities where the Conservative Party took power in municipal
elections last year.
   In Boksburg, one of those Conservative-controlled cities, Mayor
Beyers de Klerk _ who is not related to the president _ said the
time had come to form a whites-only homeland.
   Repeal of the Separate Amenities Act would still leave major
areas of segregation in South Africa _ residential neighborhoods,
medical care and public education.
   It also would leave intact the political system that gives the 5
million whites domination over the 32 million blacks, Asians and
people of mixed-race.

<HEAD>Officer Tells of Anti-Apartheid Death Squad</HEAD>

   A white former police captain
has admitted leading a death squad that he says was responsible for
assassinating several anti-apartheid activists, a newspaper
reported today.
   National police headquarters denied the existence of any police
hit squads, but said the ``wild allegations'' would be investigated.
   Dirk Coetzee, who resigned from the force in 1986, told the
Afrikaans-language newspaper Free Weekly that he participated in a
police hit squad until August 1982 and described several killings
in great detail.
   Coetzee said he had kept in contact with the unit's members and
knew of further misdeeds committed after he left the group.
   Free Weekly said it interviewed Coetzee on the Indian Ocean
island of Mauritius after he left South Africa last week with his
family to start a new life.
   Coetzee said the death squads included former African National
Congress guerrillas who chose to work with police after they were
captured.
   A statement from police headquarters said, ``The minister of law
and order and the commissioner of police have repeatedly stated
that no so-called hit squads exist.''
   Top-ranking police officials and the attorney general of the
Orange Free State Province will investigate Coetzee's charges,
police said.
   But the statement added, ``It seems strange that Capt. Coetzee
... now makes these unfounded, untested and wild allegations from a
foreign country where he cannot be questioned to verify these
claims.''
   Police did acknowledge the previously secret unit made up of
blacks who formerly belonged to the ANC, the main black group
fighting to oust the white-led government. ``They provide the force
with valuable intelligence and also play a cardinal role in the
identification of ANC terrorists infiltrating South Africa,''
police said.
   Coetzee told the newspaper: ``I was the commander of the South
African Police's death squad. My men and I had to murder political
and security opponents of the police and the government.''
   ``I myself am guilty or at least an accomplice to several
murders,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.
   Coetzee is the second former policeman recently to admit being
part of a death squad. Last month, a black former security
policeman on Death Row was reprieved the day before his scheduled
execution when he said he had killed black anti-apartheid attorney
Griffiths Mxenge in Durban in 1981.
   The former policeman, Butana Nofomela, said he had participated
in nine police killings of anti-apartheid activists.
   Nofomela was sentenced to hang for a murder-robbery of a farmer
which took place after he had left the force and had no apparent
political overtones.
   According to Free Weekly, Coetzee listed the Mxenge murder among
the acts committed by the squad to which he belonged.

<BYLINE>Housing Starts Rebound Sharply in October ^By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing starts rebounded 12 percent in October
to their highest level in nearly three years after falling in
September to their lowest point since the 1982 recession, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million units last
month, up from a revised 1.27 million units in September. Starts
had fallen 4.6 percent in September and 6.4 percent in August.
   The October gain was the largest since a 13 percent advance in
December 1986.
   September's 1.27-million-unit pace was the most sluggish rate
since new homes and apartments were being built at an annual rate
of 1.17 million units in October 1982, during the depths of the
1981-82 recession.
   The housing construction industry has been one of the economic
sectors slowed by high interest rates caused by the Federal
Reserve's grip on credit as it strives to cut inflation.
   In addition to its effect on construction jobs and the building
materials industries, the housing industry has an impact on other
housing-related businesses such as home appliances and furnishings.
   But fixed mortgage rates had fallen from their March peak of
11.22 percent, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.,
or Freddie Mac, and some analysts have been looking for an increase
in construction. Freddie Mac said fixed rates stood at 9.82 percent
at the end of October.
   Economist Michael P. Niemira of Mitsubishi Bank in New York said
builders seem less concerned by interest rates than the pace of new
sales.
   Niemira noted that while new home sales had fallen 14 percent in
September, existing home sales had risen 4.3 percent.
   ``This seems to suggest that home buyers are looking for more
affordable houses, which builders are not providing,'' he wrote in
the bank's ``Weekly Economic Indicator Report.''
   Total housing starts during the first 10 months of the year are
down 6 percent from the same period of 1988.
   Construction of single-family homes in October rose 6.9 percent
to an annual rate of 1.03 million units. Single-family starts had
fallen 3 percent in September and 3.5 percent in August.
   Apartment construction rose 28 percent in October to an annual
rate of 393,000 units. It had fallen 9.4 percent in September after
dropping 14 percent in August.
   The South turned in the sharpest increase, up 17.1 percent to
562,000 units, followed by the Midwest with a 16.5 percent gain to
289,000 units.
   Construction in the Northeast rose 6 percent to 176,000 units
and rose in the West 5.1 percent to 393,000 units.
   Applications for multifamily building permits, a barometer of
future multifamily housing activity, were up 0.5 percent in
October, following a decline of 7 percent in September.
   Overall applications for building permits rose 0.7 percent after
falling 0.7 percent in September.

   U.S. military aid to El Salvador's government
will be stepped up in light of its war with leftist guerrillas, but
members of Congress are threatening future cuts unless the fighting
stops and the murderers of six priests are brought to justice.
   ``This is probably another case of right-wing death squad
activity,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., referring to the brutal
torture and killing of six Jesuits at a university in San Salvador.
   ``If the government does not bring to justice those responsible,
we would have no choice but to try to severely limit Salvadoran aid
next year,'' added Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee with jurisdiction over foreign aid.
   ``There is brutality and murder on both sides,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Obey's Senate counterpart. ``The right
justifies it in the name of the Lord, the left justifies it in the
name of liberation, and the people die in the middle.
   ``In many ways, I feel like saying, `A pox on both your houses.'
If our aid means nothing, if our influence means nothing, everybody
has to understand that at some point ... we will leave,'' Leahy
said.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Thursday
that Ambassador William Walker was asking Salvadoran President
Alfredo Cristiani for ``a full inquiry into this horrendous act.''
Both the government and the military have denied involvement in the
killings of the priests and two housekeepers.
   ``We do not know who it was and that's one point I would like to
emphasize,'' Walker said today on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said the Salvadoran military has asked the United
States to speed up deliveries of munitions already purchased,
primarily light weaponry and riot control equipment, and that ``we
are moving to address their needs.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater later said an
investigation into the killings had already begun and added, ``We
will be watching this investigation closely.''
   On Capitol Hill, several lawmakers said the United States should
join in a Red Cross call for a 72-hour cease-fire to evacuate
civilians and the wounded. ``It would be a good first step,'' said
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.
   Congress is poised to send an additional $85 million in military
aid and $12 million for police training and equipment to El
Salvador for the current fiscal year, but the money has been held
up by unrelated disputes over other items in a $14.6 billion
foreign aid bill.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the United States is confident of the
Cristiani government's ability to defeat the guerrillas who began a
major offensive earlier this week.
   ``We believe the Salvadoran government is able to manage the
situation,'' she said.

   President Wojciech Jaruzelski has named a
longtime Communist Party official as ambassador to Moscow, the
official news agency PAP reported today.
   Stanislaw Ciosek, a former member of the party's ruling
Politburo and a member of its policy-making Central Committee,
handled trade union affairs for the previous Communist government
during Solidarity's first legal phase in 1980-81 and when the union
was banned after martial law.
   He lost his spot in the Politburo as well as his post as Central
Committee secretary at a party plenum in July.
   Ciosek is expected to take up his job in Moscow on Monday, four
days before the arrival of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a
former Solidarity editor elected to lead the first non-communist
government in the East bloc on Aug. 24.
   Solidarity supporters in the government or legislature are
well-acquainted with Ciosek, who participated in round-table talks
this spring that resulted in the legalization of Solidarity in
April after a seven-year ban and partially free elections in June.

   An 80-foot fishing boat collided with a Navy
oil tanker nearly seven times its size, injuring seven people on
the smaller vessel and causing a small oil spill, officials said
today.
   The fishing vessel Shogun, a charter boat based in San Pedro,
remained afloat despite a 3{-foot dent in its bow from the
collision with the 538-foot tanker Antarctica, said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Robert Beals.
   The accident occurred about two miles off Los Angeles Harbor
Thursday night.
   Lifeguards from Long Beach took the 43 people aboard the
charter, including six crew members, to shore in rescue boats, said
Chief Petty Officer Mark Kennedy. One woman was knocked overboard
by the collision, but was picked up by a passing vessel, said Petty
Officer Steven Dickerson.
   Shogun second mate Tim Filson, who injured his neck while at the
helm, was in good condition at St. Mary's Hospital in Long Beach
today, said nursing supervisor Todd Brabbin. He said three others
were treated and released.
   Three people who suffered minor injuries were treated at the
scene, Kennedy said.
   The collision caused a 1,680-gallon fuel spill about 100 yards
square that Beals said was quickly contained.
   The Antarctica, owned by the Irving Trust Co. of New York,
operates under charter to the Navy to transport jet fuel, Kennedy
said. It was headed for San Francisco with a merchant marine crew
of 24 and carrying 7.8 million gallons of jet fuel.
   After the crash, the tanker returned to Long Beach Harbor,
Kennedy said. The damaged Shogun also was returned to port.
   Coast Guard investigators were dispatched to determine why the
two vessels collided, Kennedy said. He said seas were calm and
visibility was good at the time.
   The Shogun is owned and operated by Richard Rogers of Torrance
and is chartered by Shogun Sports Fishing of San Diego, he said.

   Bombs damaged the homes of two
legislators who defied a Christian leader and participated in
presidential elections aimed at solving Lebanon's political crisis,
police said today.
   Also today, the Central Bank stopped sending cash to banks and
government institutions in east Beirut and the Christian enclave to
the north. The move was seen as yet another attempt to pressure the
Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun, to drop his opposition to newly
elected President Rene Mouawad.
   No casualties were reported in the explosions Thursday night
outside the homes of deputies Michel Sassin, a Greek Orthodox, and
Farid Serhal, a Maronite Catholic, police said. But window glass
was shattered and doors blown out.
   Neither of the Christian parliamentarians was at his residence
at the time. Sassin is abroad, and Serhal is at his hometown of
Jezzine in south Lebanon.
   Similar explosions have damaged the homes of Christian deputies
Tarek Habshi, Elias Hrawi, Elias el-Khazen and August Bakhos as the
inter-Christian feud escalated in recent weeks.
   The explosions were another violation of a cease-fire that began
in September after six months of intense fighting in Beirut between
Christian forces and Syrian-backed Moslem militias that killed more
than 2,000 people.
   Christian legislators have not returned to the enclave to avoid
Aoun's wrath after they approved without his consent a peace plan
to settle the civil war during a special session in Saudi Arabia in
October.
   Mouawad was elected Nov. 5, one day after Aoun, head of an
interim Cabinet that had ruled Christian regions for 13 months,
declared he had disolved the 99-seat Parliament. But legislators
said the move was illegitimate because under the Constitution only
a president can dismiss the chamber.
   Aoun has insisted on a Syrian troop withdrawal from Lebanon
before the election of a president. He rejected the peace pact
reached in Saudi Arabia because it contained no fixed timetable for
a Syrian evacuation. Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a
1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Mouawad designated Salim Hoss, a veteran Sunni Moslem
politician, to form a Cabinet of national reconciliation. Aoun has
threatened to cut ``the throats and tongues'' who defy his
rejection of Mouawad's election and the peace plan, and agree to
take part in Hoss' government.
   Central Bank governor Edmond Naim, a Maronite based in
Syrian-policed Moslem west Beirut, said in a statement he stopped
the cash flow to east Beirut to force Aoun to deposit tax revenues
collected in the Christian enclave.
   A source at Naim's office said Aoun has collected about $28
million ``in taxes and fees for public services'' in the past two
months but refused to deposit them at the Central Bank. However,
the move was also seen as an attempt to force Aoun to support the
new president.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's new premier today presented a
28-member Cabinet that includes 11 non-Communists and called for
more private enterprise to help the troubled economy, but he
rejected a free-market economy.
   In his first speech since taking office Monday, Hans Modrow also
rejected the idea of German reunification as ``dangerous and
unrealistic.''
   The 500-member Parliament met today to approve Modrow's proposed
Cabinet, which will replace the body that resigned Nov. 7.
   East German media said Communist Party chief Egon Krenz approved
the Cabinet makeup Thursday, and no serious opposition was expected
in Parliament, which convened a two-day session today.
   Despite more than a third of the seats being given to
non-Communists, the proposed Cabinet includes several holdovers
from the former hard-line leadership of Erich Honecker, and the
party still dominates.
   The non-Communists all come from parties that have been
Communist allies.
   After Modrow's speech, however, Manfred Gerlach, head of the
Liberal Democrats, announced his party would no longer run in
elections in a bloc with the Communists and called for ``true
sharing of power'' in free voting.
   His party was given three seats in the new Cabinet. In the past,
the Cabinet has been subservient to the Communist Party leadership.
   Gerlach has proposed ridding the Constitution of the Communists'
40-year monopoly on power, and a parliamentary committee was to be
set up to study that and other possible changes.
   Modrow, in his speech to Parliament, outlined hopes for
improving the lives of East Germans while retaining a planned
socialist economy.
   He said the nation is ``open for proposals on joint ventures,
investment, transfer of profits and environmental pilot projects,''
all of which address some of the concerns of Western business
looking for openings in the East German market.
   ``The government sees as its most urgent responsibility the
stabilization of the economy,'' Modrow said.
   He called for ``increasing individual responsibility of the
economic units'' and the introduction of some private enterprise to
encourage East Germans to produce goods and services to help end
shortages.
   Modrow urged improvements in the sometimes stifling planned
economy but rejected a full free-market economy.
   He called for a ``better socialism,'' with better supplies of
consumer goods and a ``full and varied life'' for the East German
population.
   Modrow also suggested legal and political reforms, including
removal of restrictions that prohibit unauthorized public
gatherings and free expression. Authorities have tolerated massive
pro-democracy demonstrations in East Germany in recent weeks, but
such demonstrations remain technically illegal.
   East German leaders have been struggling to retain a basic
socialist system in a nation swept by pro-democracy activism and
tempted by offers of aid from West Germany in return for
free-market reforms.
   ``We must have unwavering political and ideological tolerance,''
Modrow said, apparently referring to Western appeals for East
Germany to accept some capitalist reforms.
   ``By means of a new reality of life in the German Democratic
Republic (East Germany), the dangerous and unrealistic talk of a
reunification will be clearly rejected,'' he said, drawing a long
round of applause from lawmakers.
   Modrow's government is faced with a struggling economy in need
of a massive overhaul. He also must win popular trust for a
leadership that until a month ago governed by Stalinist edicts.
   The East German labor force has been impoverished this year by
the flight of more than 200,000 citizens to West Germany, although
some, encouraged by reforms, now are headed back to their homeland.
   During his speech to Parliament, Gerlach repeated his call for
new legislation on voting rights and new elections.
   But he made clear in an interview with East German television
later that he foresees no break with the nation's socialist
tradition.
   ``We are a party of socialists in a socialist system,'' Gerlach
said of his Liberal Democratic Party. ``The task before us now is
to define what socialism means and how we can make it meet the
needs of the people.''
   On Thursday, the Communist Party stripped 27 people of their
seats in Parliament, including Honecker and his wife, Margot, who
previously was sacked from her job as education minister.
   The others who lost their seats were mainly officials associated
with Honecker's orthodox rule, which ended Oct. 18 amid an exodus
of East Germans fed up with their rigid homeland. Since Krenz took
over, East Germany has opened its borders to the West, and passages
have been carved in the Berlin Wall.
   President Bush has expressed interest in closer ties to East
Germany and praised the nation's reform course in a message to
Krenz, East Germany's official news agency ADN said today.
Relations between Washington and East Berlin often were strained
under Honecker.
   In the written message to Krenz, Bush said he welcomed the
country's new open-border policy, according to ADN. The news agency
did not say how or when the message was delivered.

   A Navy boat was swamped as it returned to
base to participate in an unprecedented service-wide ``stand-down''
for safety. None of 10 sailors aboard was injured.
   The accident Thursday occurred as most of the Navy began two
days of safety exercises for its sailors around the world after 10
accidents in the past three weeks killed 10 people and injured at
least 71.
   The 36-foot Navy Seafox was swamped in stormy weather on the
nearby York River. A Virginia Institute of Marine Science vessel in
the area picked up the 10 sailors, who were not injured, said Lt.
Cmdr. Steve Burnett, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman in Norfolk.
   ``At no time was it a life-threatening situation,'' he said.
   For most of the Navy, whether in port or at sea, Thursday began
48 hours of drills, lectures, inspections and dialogue about the
service's job and how to do it safely.
   ``It gives us a chance to step back from the trees and see the
forest,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Mike John, another Atlantic Fleet
spokesman.
   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III and Adm. Carlisle A.H.
Trost, chief of naval operations, on Tuesday ordered all Navy units
to complete 48 hours of safety work within 72 hours. Most Atlantic
Fleet units began the stand-down Thursday morning, though some
began Wednesday, Burnett said.
   Garrett defended the Navy's safety record in a speech in
Jacksonville, Fla., in spite of the string of accidents. He said
that although no common problem linked the accidents, the
stand-down would be a success simply because of the number of
people involved.
   ``It is the human error that we will allow them to reflect upon
during this time,'' Garrett told the Jacksonville Council of the
Navy League.
   On the guided missile cruiser USS Josephus Daniels, the seamen
were gathered in compartments going over the procedures for
everything from the handling of surface-to-air missiles to the
electrical safety checking of personal radios.
   Lt. j.g. Paul Ward, the ship's assistant damage control officer,
saw the stand-down as a good way to stress safety to all hands.
   ``Everyone here has to be a capable firefighter. When there is a
fire on board, you can't just run away. ... There is nowhere to
run,'' Ward said.
   Stand-downs are not unusual, but Capt. Ferguson Norton,
commander of the Naval Safety Center and the Navy's top safety
officer, said this is the first service-wide stand-down in memory.
   At the Oceana Naval Air Station near Norfolk, pilots and flight
crews of ``The Black Aces,'' Squadron VF-41, were going over their
F-14 Tomcats.
   ``After a while, you start equating safety with combat
readiness,'' Lt. Cmdr. Ken Heimgartner, the squadron commander,
said as he watched his young ground crew go over his aircraft.
``When you start seeing something unsafe, that's an indicator you
may not be combat ready.''
   At the Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego, Rear Adm. Phil
Anselmo joined about 1,000 sailors in a walk around runways,
taxiways and aprons looking for potentially hazardous litter. They
found about 50 pounds, including industrial bolts and chunks of
epoxy.

<HEAD>A Revival of `Gypsy' Starring Tyne Daly Opens on Broadway</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Is everything still coming up roses for
``Gypsy,'' 30 years after the Jule Styne-Arthur Laurents-Stephen
Sondheim musical first opened on Broadway?
   Well, almost. For those needing proof, the evidence is on
display at the St. James Theater, where a revival opened Thursday
after a long national tour. For much of the evening, the production
reaffirms the show's reputation as one of the greatest American
musical comedies.
   ``Gypsy,'' a showbiz saga about the quintessential stage mother,
is a near-perfect amalgam of book, music and lyrics. The brash,
brassy music is Styne's best theater score. Try listening to that
overture, with those original orchestrations by Sid Ramin and
Robert Ginzler, and not shiver. Sondheim's lyrics are playful but
not simplistic. And Laurents' tough, lean book is fast, furious and
funny, an affectionate yet never sentimental look at the dying days
of vaudeville.
   So the only question about any major Broadway revival is how
well these elements are served and who plays Rose, the greedy,
grasping Gorgon of a mother whose little girl, Louise, grows up to
become the stripper Gypsy Rose Lee.
   It's a difficult role, not only because it anchors the whole
show but because of who has played it in the past. The
larger-than-life ghost of Ethel Merman hovers over the musical. She
made Rose her own in 1959, and if a lot of today's theatergoers
didn't see her, they have the original cast recording to make
comparisons. Others caught the 1974 revival starring Angela
Lansbury, whose acting ability made up for what she lacked in vocal
power.
   Now, Tyne Daly, best known as the star of television's ``Cagney
and Lacey,'' has taken up the challenge. And she has succeeded _
with one drawback.
   The woman is a terrific actress and even has a few Mermanesque
qualities. She talks tough and can bully with the best of them in
scenes when she tries to find jobs in vaudeville for her daughters,
Baby June and Louise.
   And she also has a girlish, flirtatious side that her
predecessors lacked. It's a quality that makes her scenes with the
lovestruck Herbie, the one-time candy seller turned agent, work
better than they ever have before. It also helps that Herbie is
beautifully played by Jonathan Hadary, a mournful basset hound of
an actor.
   But any performer playing Rose must do more than act. Much of
Rose's fierceness and determination is expressed in song. The woman
has three important solo numbers in the show _ ``Some People,''
``Everything's Coming Up Roses'' and ``Rose's Turn.'' They define
her character and the musical itself.
   Daly gets through them adequately, but one misses the vocal
fireworks that make them terrifying hymns of self-delusion and
overconfidence.
   As a result, much of the show's musical pleasure shifts to the
other songs. Rose's softer numbers, such as ``Small World,''
``You'll Never Get Away From Me'' and ``Together'' stand out as
well as the tacky vaudeville sequences such as ``Dainty June and
Her Farmboys'' and that ultimate showstopper, ``You Gotta Have a
Gimmick.''
   The latter is staged to perfection by Bonnie Walker, who
recreated Jerome Robbins' original choreography. The three aging
strippers are played by Barbara Erwin, Anna McNeely and Jana
Robbins. Never has over-the-hill been so appealing and funny.
   Their sexiness is made more apparent by the bland impression of
the budding Gypsy Rose Lee done by Crista Moore. Her strip numbers
are stiff and unconvincing, more as if she is doing her duty than a
dance. But Robert Lambert's ``All I Need Is the Girl'' captures the
poignancy as well as the exhilaration of the song.
   The rest of the cast is fine, particularly a gaggle of perfectly
obnoxious children, drilled to military precision by author
Laurents, who also doubled as director.
   Kenneth Foy's backstage settings are not elaborate and look as
if they had been made for touring, not Broadway. That goes for the
costumes by Theoni V. Aldredge, too.
   But it's not the sets or costumes one remembers from ``Gypsy.''
It's Laurents' glorious story of show business dreams and those
wonderful songs. If Daly's vocal talents don't overwhelm, her
acting ability more than compensates. You can understand from her
performance why the indomitable Mama Rose would want to get into
show business in the first place.
   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: ... I've always had only one
choice in the category of favorite musical. It is ``Gypsy'' and as
I sat at its scorching new revival starring Tyne Daly, once again
swept up in its goosebump-raising torrents of laughter and tears, I
realized why, if anything, this 30-year-old show actually keeps
improving with age. ... ``Gypsy'' is nothing if not Broadway's own
brassy, unlikely answer to ``King Lear.'' It speaks to you one way
when you are a child, then chases after you to say something else
when you've grown up.
   Clive Barnes, New York Post: Daly goes through the motions with
a trouper-like diligence and loving histrionic care ... this
``Gypsy'' is not bad. It might keep a few camp fires burning, but
it is not as fantastic as it needed to be. It is a show that called
for rethinking rather than reviving.
   Howard Kissel, Daily News: The solidity and power of ``Gypsy''
are clear in the revival directed by Arthur Laurents ... (Tyne
Daly) has the energy; she has a resilient, though not very sizable
voice, but she's not the Force of Nature you need for the
monstrous, heroic Rose.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government forces and leftist
insurgents fought into early today after warplanes bombed rebel
positions and the two sides battled block to block in the capital.
   By daylight, fighting had tapered off, and San Salvador woke to
its quietest morning since a rebel offensive began six days ago.
The latest casualties included a British journalist who was shot
and seriously wounded.
   The offensive _ the rebels' biggest in their 10-year-old war
with the U.S.-backed government _ has killed at least 800 people
and wounded 1,600 nationwide, according to hospitals and the
government.
   Although gunfire was heard throughout the night, it was mild
compared to the intensity of previous days. An overnight curfew
made it impossible to reach battle zones to assess the situation.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker told The Associatd Press today
that the United States was prepared to offer protection to anyone
who would come forward with information about the massacre Thursday
of six Jesuit priests.
   Walker said he would contact officials at the Jesuit university
who have said two witnesses saw about 30 men in army uniforms enter
the priests' residence just before the shooting began.
   The entire capital seemed to be under fire Thursday. Air force
jets screamed overhead, followed by thundering explosions as bombs
dropped on rebel strongholds.
   Several hundred guerrillas descended overnight from the hills
above the northern neighborhood of Mejicanos to try to take control
of the main streets.
   That is where the British journalist, David Michael Blundy of
the Sunday Correspondent of London, was caught in a crossfire and
wounded early today. Blundy was shot in the right shoulder and
taken to Rosales Hospital, where he was listed in serious condition.
   In Soyapango on the eastern side of the city, the rebels
appeared to have backed down after intense house-to-house combat.
   Fighting also raged in northern Zacamil, a neighborhood the
rebels have held since Saturday.
   About 1,500 guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front are thought to be involved in the attack in San
Salvador.
   Thousands of Salvadorans have been forced to flee their homes,
and many have blamed the guerrillas for their misery.
   ``We were caught in the cross fire,'' Angel Erazo said Thursday
as she clutched a kitten in one hand and a bag of clothes in the
other. ``It was a horrible night.''
   Residents of one neighborhood who had been without food for days
looted a marketplace.
   ``We have no food, no money, nowhere to go,'' sobbed Adilia
Hernandez of Zacamil.
   Rebel leaders have acknowledged they cannot win the war. The
guerrillas, estimated to have 7,000 full-time fighters and 11,000
backups nationwide, are heavily outnumbered by the 56,000-member
Salvadoran army and other security forces.
   The rebels said they attacked to prove the army also cannot win.
   They say rightist President Alfredo Cristiani cannot govern
without granting a role to their front.
   The guerrillas began their attacks Saturday, three days after
they broke off peace talks with the U.S.-backed government,
claiming it was not serious about reaching a settlement.

   The wife of a millionaire developer killed in his
bedroom with his own handgun faces the electric chair after she was
convicted of offering three thugs $100,000 to shoot him.
   Prosecutors painted Joyce Cohen as a once-poor jet-setter who
was trying to avoid a divorce from Stanley Cohen, while her
attorney blamed the slaying on her husband's supposed drug
connections.
   A Circuit Court jury Thursday convicted Mrs. Cohen, 39, of
first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and using a
firearm in the commission of the March 7, 1986, shooting at the
couple's upscale house in Coconut Grove.
   Cohen, 52, was shot in the head four times.
   ``We're very, very relieved,'' said Cohen's brother, Arthur
Cohen. ``This has been 3{ years. It was hard _ going to the police
station, listening to what the police had found, listening to the
trial.''
   Mrs. Cohen was indicted after one of the three hired men, Frank
Zuccarello, agreed to cooperate in return for immunity.
   Zuccarello testified that Mrs. Cohen offered him and two other
men $100,000 to kill her husband. She supplied a map of the house,
disconnected security alarms, unlocked the door and even gave them
Cohen's own gun, Zuccarello testified.
   A police expert testified there was gunpowder residue on a
tissue found in a wastebasket in Mrs. Cohen's bathroom.
   Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The penalty phase of
the trial was scheduled to begin Monday with the same jury. Mrs.
Cohen had been free on $1 million bond but was jailed after her
conviction.
   Mrs. Cohen's attorney, Alan Ross, tried to blame the killing on
her husband's supposed drug connections, a tactic the victim's
brother called ``a bunch of absolute lies.''
   The couple were married for 11 years. Mrs. Cohen was once her
husband's secretary and soon got used to the life of a jet-setter,
commuting by private jet to their Colorado ranch and using cocaine,
according to testimony.
   Prosecutors said the marriage eventually soured. According to
testimony, Mrs. Cohen feared a divorce would end her posh lifestyle.
   Mrs. Cohen admitted turning off the alarm system and locking up
the dog the night of the murder, but said she had insomnia and
wanted the system off while she wandered around the house preparing
items for a garage sale.

   Pope John Paul II today decried the murder
of six Jesuits in El Salvador as an act of ``abominable violence''
and said he was praying for reconciliation in the Central American
country torn by civil war.
   In a telegram to the archbishop of San Salvador, Monsignor
Arturo Rivera Damas, the pope said he was deeply disturbed by the
news of the ``barbarous assassination'' of the Jesuits, their
housekeeper and her 15-year-old daughter.
   John Paul said he wanted to assure the archbishop and the
families of the victims of his ``deep pain for this act of
abominable violence'' and his prayers for the eternal rest for the
dead.
   The pope said he prayed that the sacrifice of the Jesuits would
induce everyone to ``reject violence and respect the lifes of their
brothers to bring peace and reconciliation to this suffering
country.''
   Jesuit headquarters announced that the leader of the religious
order, the Rev. Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, will preside at a special
Mass in Rome on Monday for the murdered Jesuits and ``all the
victims in El Salvador.''

   The Vatican confirmed today that Pope John
Paul II will meet for the first time with Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
Dec. 1 and called it an ``official'' visit, a sign of the
importance the Vatican attaches to it.
   The Soviet leader will visit the Vatican during a three-day trip
to Italy and a day before he holds talks with President Bush off
Malta.
   The Vatican gave no details on the meeting, and the confirmation
was contained in a brief notice advising on arrangements for the
news media.
   Official visits often include an exchange of speeches as well as
private talks and a tour of St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican
museum.
   During the meeting, the pope is expected to press his case for
full religious freedom in the Soviet Union, discuss a possible
papal trip and renew his call for legalization of the Ukrainian
Catholic Church.
   The Ukrainian Church was suppressed in 1946 by Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin and forcibly merged with the Russian Orthodox Church.
By Western estimates, at least 4 million Ukrainian Catholics live
in the Soviet Union.
   The Vatican today also disclosed that Rome-based Cardinal
Miroslav Lubachivsky and other Ukrainian prelates living in the
West met with Vatican officials and the pope earlier this week to
discuss the state of the Ukrainian church and its relations with
the Russian Orthodox.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Say Pesticide Used to Fight Medflies Poses Health
Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aerial assaults of the pesticide malathion to
fight Mediterranean fruit fly infestations have renewed the
controversy over what some environmentalists and politicians say is
a health risk.
   Aerial spraying of a 22-square-mile area about 15 miles north of
downtown was completed early today in the latest effort by
agriculture officials to eradicate the pest. More spraying was
scheduled over several areas next week.
   The latest fertile fly discovery occurred Wednesday in Hacienda
Heights, with the trapping of a male insect. Earlier this week, a
pregnant Medfly was found in North Hollywood, a previously
unaffected San Fernando Valley suburb.
   The Green Party, a political group dedicated to environmental
issues, scheduled a demonstration Monday to protest use of the
chemical, party chairman Randall Toler said.
   He said the cancer-causing potential of malathion remains under
review by the federal government. The group calls for the use of
sterile Medflies instead of pesticides to halt the infestation.
   Toler said agriculture officials ``were caught flat-footed
without adequate supplies of sterile Medflies.''
   Millions of the laboratory-sterilized flies were released after
sprayings to fight previous infestations, with the goal of breeding
fertile flies out of existence.
   Officials authorized double malathion sprayings over infested
communities, including North Hollywood, Burbank, Studio City and
Toluca Lake, after a supply of sterile Medflies ran out.
   City Councilman Richard Alatorre, who represents an infested
district, wrote to state Food and Agricultural Director Henry Voss:
``Clearly, the Mediterranean fruit fly is a serious menace to the
welfare of this region and ultimately the state. It is equally
clear, however, that one of the weapons used in the battle to
eradicate this menace, malathion, is itself of questionable safety
to the health of humans exposed to it.''
   Carol Ward, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of
Health Services, defended malathion's use against the Medfly, which
lays its eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables,
threatening the state's $16-billion-a-year agriculture industry.
   ``We feel strongly that the doses that are sprayed are not going
to cause any health problems,'' Ms. Ward said. She said less than
an ounce of malathion is spayed per acre.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa kissed the hand of
a Rockefeller and wowed a gathering of industrial leaders and union
bigwigs upon his triumphant arrival in the capital of the
capitalist world.
   The shipyard electrician from Gdansk whose labor movement
changed Poland met with American union leaders this morning and
praised this country's willingness to help his homeland.
   Starting his second day in New York, Walesa told a gathering of
labor chiefs that in Poland, ``we fight, we risk. ... This is the
greatness of America. We have to fight. We have no choice. You do
not have to fight.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo joined the meeting and announced plans by
Harper &amp; Row to publish a collection of Abraham Lincoln's speeches
and writings on democracy in Polish and English next year.
   Cuomo said he conceived of the ``Lincoln on Democracy Project''
during a meeting in June with teachers from Poland who told him
books on Lincoln were not available in their country.
   In thanking Cuomo for the Lincoln project, Walesa alluded to the
pace of political change throughout Eastern Europe. ``I don't know
if you can keep pace with translations for other languages because
the line is already forming.''
   Walesa's schedule today also included meetings with the
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations,
and the editorial boards of The New York Times and The Wall Street
Journal; and a lunch with business leaders and John C. Whitehead,
former U.S. deputy secretary of state.
   He will fly to Chicago tonight.
   Walesa, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize winner, received several
gifts at the labor meeting, including an electrician's tool belt, a
clock and a set of knives. He accepted the knives in mock protest,
saying, ``I'm all for non-violent struggle. I will not use these
against anybody.''
   On Thursday night, Walesa gave a pep talk to capitalist
heavyweights and union bigwigs who celebrated the success of his
Solidarity movement.
   ``Please believe your possibilities are endless; if you have
self-confidence you can move mountains,'' Walesa said at a dinner.
   ``Please care for this country, because this country is a beacon
of hope for people elsewhere.''
   Walesa said through an interpreter that his own role in
democracy is ``simply a question of fate; the fates forced us to
take some initiatives. If I were here, I would most probably fix
refrigerators or irons.''
   Some 700 industrial and union leaders, government officials and
private citizens attended the dinner of the International Rescue
Committee, a nonsectarian, voluntary agency that runs relief,
medical and resettlement for refugees fleeing political, religious
or racial persecution.
   The committee gave Walesa its Freedom Award. Past recipients
included Winston Churchill, George Meany, Hubert Humphrey and Elie
Wiesel.
   The dinner was Walesa's first appearance in a two-day visit to
New York after he spent four days in Washington, where he met with
President Bush, addressed a joint session of Congress and received
the cheers of U.S. labor leaders.
   At a reception before the dinner Thursday night, Walesa kissed
the hand of socialite Happy Rockefeller, the widow of Nelson
Rockefeller.
   Peter G. Peterson, former U.S. commerce secretary and the
dinner's co-chairman, introduced Walesa as ``the hero of the
Western world; the hero, indeed, of the entire world.''
   Walesa bowed to the audience, then flashed two-fingered ``V's''
for victory with both hands raised above his head.
   Only a handful of his admirers showed up outside the midtown
Manhattan hotel where Walesa received his award. But inside the
Sheraton Centre ballroom, many spoke of the significance of the
Solidarity leader's triumph.
   ``It proves to us in the union movement what we've been saying
all along ... that you can't really have democracy without free
unions,'' said Robert G. Porter, secretary-treasurer of the
American Federation of Teachers.
   ``I think he's remarkable,'' said George Gellert of Oradell,
N.J., whose company, Atalanta Corp., in Elizabeth, N.J., imports
Polish hams. His father-in-law, who started the company in 1945,
owned meat factories in Poland before World War II.
   Companies like American Express and Price Waterhouse, as well as
a variety of American labor unions and private donors, paid $300 to
$2,500 a head to attend the banquet, which benefited the committee.
   Earlier Thursday in Washington, Walesa told a packed luncheon at
the National Press Club that ``the Iron Curtain is no more.'' But
he also said the West will be to blame if Poland's experiment in
democracy fails for lack of economic support.
   ``If we do not succeed in evolution, a revolution may come,''
Walesa said.
   Walesa also found time Tuesday to tape a 30-second commercial
for the AFL-CIO's ``Union Yes'' advertising campaign. In the ad he
speaks in Polish, with a translator, until the end when he switches
to English and gives the ``Union Yes'' slogan.
   The taping took about 90 minutes, partly because Walesa had such
trouble pronouncing ``union.''

   Former President Reagan is under orders to
turn over documents by Wednesday to John Poindexter, who says his
alleged crimes in the Iran-Contra affair were authorized by the
president.
   In an order issued Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Harold
Greene said Poindexter ``may serve upon former President Reagan and
upon the archivist of the United States the subpoenas ... submitted
to the court.''
   The archivist has possession of presidential records of the
Reagan administration. Reagan took his diary with him when he left
the White House.
   Greene's ruling marks the first time in the Iran-Contra scandal
that a judge has approved a subpoena for documents from Reagan.
   Poindexter's lawyers say they want Reagan's diary as well as
notes he took at key meetings with his national security adviser,
but it is unclear what the subpoenas demand, since Greene did not
disclose their contents.
   The judge ruled last month that Poindexter, who was Reagan's
national security adviser, is entitled to subpoena ``specific,
relevant documents'' bearing on the criminal charges against him.
   Reagan's lawyers, who on Thursday night declined to comment, are
almost certain to challenge the subpoenas, but the Justice
Department may be less likely to step into a legal battle.
   Reagan, asked by reporters in Cincinnati about the subpoena,
said, ``Cases like that before the law, I don't comment.''
   The Justice Department will examine the Reagan subpoena in light
of the 1974 Supreme Court ruling on the Watergate tapes, said a
Justice Department source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``We are in the process of reviewing'' Greene's order ``to
determine what action we should take, if any,'' said Justice
Department spokesman David Runkel.
   If it chose to do so, the department could object to the
subpoena on behalf of the former president, as it did earlier this
year in urging that a subpoena be quashed seeking Reagan's
appearance at Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial.
   During the Watergate scandal, the court ruled that President
Nixon had to comply with a subpoena from the special prosecutor to
produce tape recordings of 64 conversations. The court ruled that
the specific need for the evidence in a criminal case outweighed
the president's rights in the matter.
   Poindexter says that in regard to his actions that led to his
indictment in the Iran-Contra affair, Reagan ``formulated'' the
position on some matters and ``entertained Poindexter's plans
without voicing any objection'' on others, according to a court
opinion Greene issued last month.
   ``It appears that notes were taken by the president and others
on these conversations,'' said the judge.
   Poindexter asserts that ``these notes or presidential diary
entries made pursuant thereto would support his defense'' to the
criminal charges against him, Greene noted.
   Poindexter has said he met daily, frequently alone with the
president during the Iran-Contra affair.
   Poindexter, who is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 22, is under
indictment on two counts of making false statements to Congress,
two counts of obstruction and one count of conspiracy. He is
accused of obstructing Congress by denying that the National
Security Council staff was offering tactical advice or soliciting
funds for the Contras.
   Earlier this year, U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell
quashed a subpoena for documents sought from Reagan in the case
against Oliver North.
   Among other topics, Poindexter said he and the president
discussed the accuracy of a chronology on the Iran-Contra affair.
   The chronology said that no official in the U.S. government
learned before January 1986 that Hawk missiles had been shipped to
Iran in November 1985.
   The CIA-assisted shipment, overseen by North, who kept
Poindexter informed on its progress, occurred without the existence
of a presidential finding as required by law. Reagan signed a
retroactive finding the month after the Hawks were transported to
Iran.
   Poindexter also said Reagan took notes of discussions focusing
on how to respond to congressional inquiries about whether the
administration was secretly assisting the Contras during a
congressional ban on the use of appropriations by intelligence
agencies to aid the rebels.

   A 101-year-old woman accused of shooting at
her granddaughter has missed a court appearance, and authorities
said the case will be forwarded to a grand jury.
   ``Sure I tried to shoot her, damned right I tried to shoot
her,'' said Irene Phillips. ``She's as mean as the devil.''
   Ms. Phillips, of Lawnside, was scheduled to appear Thursday
before Superior Court Judge David A. Keyko on aggravated assault
charges stemming from a Nov. 4 domestic dispute at her home. No
arrest warrant was issued but Camden County Prosecutor Samuel
Asbell said a grand jury would hear the case next month.
   Police allege Ms. Phillips shot at her granddaughter, Ruby
Jones, 46, with a .32-caliber handgun after the pair argued about a
radio.
   Ms. Phillips, who was partly paralyzed by a stroke and uses a
walker, was arrested and released into the custody of another
granddaughter after posting $5,000 bail.
   Ms. Jones told police that her grandmother pointed the gun at
her and said, ``I'm going to kill you.'' A bullet narrowly missed
her, police said.
   Ms. Phillips said she became angry after she woke up during the
night and found that her granddaughter had taken her radio. She
said she uses the radio because she cannot get to church anymore
and needs ``to hear good preaching on Sunday.''
   Asbell said he cannot not dismiss the complaint against Ms.
Phillips, who faces a mandatory three-year minimum jail sentence if
convicted.

   An Air Force F-16A jet crashed in
Biscayne Bay today but the pilot ejected safely and was later
picked up by helicopter, Coast Guard and Air Force officials said.
   The $16 million, single-seat fighter went down during a routine
training mission in good weather near Elliot Key, about 10 miles
east of Homestead, around 8:30 a.m. EST. It was assigned to the
308th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Homestead Air Force Base.
   Within 10 minutes, the pilot was picked up from a life raft by
an Air Force helicopter, said base spokesman Sgt. Anthony Roland.
   A Coast Guard jet flew over the life raft until the helicopter
arrived, and the pilot appeared to be in good condition, said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Veronica Cady. Crew members said the plane was
visible in the shallow water, she added.
   A board of officers will investigate, an Air Force statement
said.
   An F-16A from the same base crashed into a swampy Dade County
field in August. The pilot ejected and suffered only minor injuries.

   The head of a presidential commission today
promised a thorough investigation of the government response to the
bombing of Pan AM Flight 103 and told relatives of its victims,
``We won't let you down.''
   Nearly a year after the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, which
killed 270 people, former Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin opened the
first of several hearings planned before the commission reports its
findings to President Bush next May.
   ``We will let the chips fall where they may,'' Mrs. McLaughlin
said, speaking for the seven-member commission which includes four
members of Congress and two prominent military figures.
   She said the commission's inquiry would evaluate existing
aviation security procedures, the handling of threats against
airlines and whether the public should be notified of them, and the
government's treatment of victims of aviation terrorism.
   Four relatives of people killed aboard the Boeing-747 airliner
testified at the opening of the hearing, including Bert Ammerman,
president of Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, which had called for the
investigation.
   ``The American government has broken faith with its citizens. It
has turned its back on its responsibility to protect the lives of
American citizens at home and abroad,'' Ammerman said. He said
security measures taken since the bombing have been ``little more
than a lot of words.''
   He said those killed in the flight were ``caught up in an
inescapable web of foreign intrigue, evil forces, unscrupulous
airline practices, government double standards, and bureaucratic
unaccountability.''
   In emotional testimony, Victoria Cummock of Coral Gables, Fla.,
described the badly damaged attache case of her husband, who died
aboard the flight, and said, ``Ladies and gentlemen, this is what
remains of John Cummock.''
   The widow said one of her three children, 4-year-old Matthew,
one morning asked for a gun.
   ``I asked him why he wanted a toy gun,'' she said. ``He said he
didn't want any toy gun. He wanted a real gun to shoot himself so
we could all shoot ourselves in order to be with daddy.''
   Mrs. Cummock said she wanted the commission to feel the effects
of the disaster on her family so it would not be considered just an
``unfortunate isolated incident or an inconvenience in a system
that occasionally goes on the blink.''
   ``We won't let you down,'' Mrs. McLaughlin promised.
   Members of the commission include Sens. Frank R. Lautenberg,
D-N.J., and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., Reps. James Oberstar, D-Minn.,
and John Hammerschmidt, R-Ark., former Assistant Navy Secretary
Edward Hidalgo and retired Air Force Gen. Thomas C. Richards. They
were appointed by President Bush last month.
   Relatives of some of the 189 Americans killed returned last week
from a trip to Frankfurt, West Germany, where the Dec. 21, 1988,
flight originated. They have been trying to get the German
government to reveal more details about the flight.
   The relatives are asking the Presidential Commission on Aviation
Security and Terrorism to ``fully and thoroughly investigate all
leads into the cause of the bombing,'' including Pan Am's security
procedures.
   They also want the commission to find out what the U.S., British
and West German governments knew about terrorist threats before the
Frankfurt-London-New York flight.
   The explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland, has been traced to a
radio cassette player in the cargo hold, but investigators have not
determined who placed it there.
   Richard Lally, vice president of the Air Transport Association,
which represents U.S. airlines, cited what he called a ``serious
flaw'' in Federal Aviation Administration security programs.
   ``The FAA should impose the same security requirements on
foreign carriers serving the U.S. as it imposes on U.S. carriers,''
Lally said in his prepared testimony.
   He noted that in 1985 and again after the Lockerbie bombing, the
FAA imposed extraordinary security requirements on U.S. airlines at
airports in Western Europe, the Middle East and Far East, while
foreign airlines don't have to meet the same requirements.
   The Transportation Department has ordered airlines to pay for
sophisticated explosives detection devices, but a bill pending in
Congress would require the government to pay the bill.
   Lally criticized the government program to install 150 of the
thermal neutron analysis (TNA) systems in airports by the end of
1991, saying the equipment needs more testing.
   ``All experts appear to be in complete agreement that TNA does
not present a full or final answer to the problem of explosives
detection,'' Lally said. The devices cost about $1 million each.
   Lally also urged the United States to adopt the Montreal
Protocols, that would increase the amount of damages victims can
claim in terrorist attacks on commercial aviation.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Refugee Wins $6 Million Lottery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 23-year-old Vietnamese refugee has won
$6 million in an Ohio Lottery game, six years after he fled his
homeland with only the clothes on his back.
   Anhtinh Ton Giang will receive $300,000 a year, before taxes,
for 20 years.
   Giang said he will quit his $5.75-an-hour job at HFI Inc., which
makes interior trim for automobiles. Giang, who has worked in
construction, said he might go into partnership with friends to
remodel and sell old houses.
   ``Even if I have money, I won't be a lazy guy,'' he said. ``I'd
like to do work that would improve myself. ... A few years ago,
when I came here, I was very poor, but I always worked hard.''
   Giang was the only person with the six winning numbers in
Wednesday's Super Lotto drawing. He said he let the lottery's
computer pick the numbers, from one to 44, on his $1 ticket.
   He said he's not sure how he will spend the money, except to pay
his brother Cam's way through college. Cam is a freshman at Ohio
State University.
   ``In the next few days, I'll have to do a lot of thinking, he
said. ``I'm talking to a lawyer, trying to find the best way for
the future.''
   Giang said he fled Vietnam because his family was politically
persecuted.
   ``My family was involved with the former government and with
Americans. It was very tough,'' he said.
   After spending 18 months in a refugee camp in Indonesia, he came
to the United States and was sent to Columbus by a resettlement
agency five years ago.
   Besides his brother, Giang has an uncle and a cousin in the
United States. He said the rest of his family is still in Vietnam.
   ``I always dreamed about winning the lottery, but I know the
chances are so small,'' he said. ``I didn't spend a lot of money.
It's cost me about $6 over five years.''

   A man who punched his public defender in the
face as a jury looked on has been convicted of the charges that
brought him to court in the first place.
   Isaih Johnson Grady's blow left Assistant Public Defender John
Benito crumpled on the floor Wednesday.
   Bailiffs quickly subdued Grady. Benito was taken to a hospital,
where he received several stitches near his eye.
   Grady, 31, was found guilty Thursday on all seven counts against
him _ rape, robbery, burglary and two counts each of kidnapping and
aggravated assault in a May 19 attack on a woman.
   The punching occurred in the first hour of Grady's trial. Grady
knocked his lawyer to the floor, then stood over him and yelled,
``Don't call me no nigger,'' something witnesses said they never
heard Benito say.
   Grady was chained to his chair Wednesday and Thursday,
delivering his own closing argument that way.
   Circuit Judge Manuel Menendez Jr. ruled that by punching Benito,
Grady had discharged his attorney.
   Throughout his court appearances, Grady called Benito an
incompetent ``donkey'' and also insulted Menendez, who scheduled
sentencing for Jan. 5.

<HEAD>Advocates Demonstrate Against Judge in Lisa Steinberg Civil Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Adoption advocates say a judge was wrong when he
ruled that a woman ``abandoned'' her daughter by giving her up for
adoption and cannot sue for the child's wrongful death at the hands
of a foster father.
   ``Adoption is not abandonment,'' Michele Launders, the
biological mother of abuse victim Lisa Steinberg, said Thursday.
``Having a baby in a parking lot and leaving it there _ that's
abandonment.''
   In 1981 at age 19, Launders, unwed, put her baby up for adoption
through lawyer Joel Steinberg. Steinberg promised her he would
place the baby with a middle-class Catholic family. Instead, he
kept the child without legally adopting her and named her Lisa.
   The girl died of brain injuries at age 6. Steinberg, 48, was
convicted last year of manslaughter and sentenced to up to 25 years
in prison.
   ``I feel moral outrage that birth mothers, after choosing life
over abortion, are further traumatized through public humiliation
of having to wear the label of abandonment,'' said Launders'
mother, Anita.
   About 15 people from five adoption advocacy groups joined
Launders in the protest march against state Supreme Court Justice
Eugene Nardelli, who ruled that Launders had no standing to sue
Steinberg.
   ``I feel he's very, very wrong,'' said Launders, 28.
   Carol Gustavson, head of Adoptive Parents for Open Records, an
advocacy group based in Long Valley, N.J., called Nardelli's
comments ``cutting.''
   ``We're very upset that the word `abandonment' is used to
describe Michele,'' said Gustavson, who said she adopted four
children, now adults.
   On Nov. 2, 1987, Lisa, 6, was taken comatose from Steinberg's
Greenwich Village apartment to a hospital where she died of brain
injuries three days later.

   Carter Olin Lowance, chief of staff to
six Virginia governors, has died of cancer at age 78.
   Lowance, who died Thursday in a Williamsburg hospital, left the
staff of The Associated Press in Richmond in 1947 to work for Gov.
William M. Tuck. He served successively under Govs. John S. Battle,
Thomas B. Stanley, J. Lindsay Almond, Albertis S. Harrison and
Mills E. Godwin Jr.
   When Republican Gov. Linwood Holton broke the long line of
Democratic succession in 1970, he asked Lowance to stay on. But
Lowance decided instead to take a job as executive vice president
at the College of William &amp; Mary.
   ``He served Virginia as well as any man I've ever known,''
Harrison said. ``Completely self-effacing, he was perfectly willing
to do the work and let somebody else get the credit.''
   ``When Carter spoke, government listened, but he barely spoke
above a whisper,'' said Gov. Gerald L. Baliles. ``While others
governed, Carter guided. He was cautious, always knowledgeable and
steady at the wheel.''
   Survivors include his wife, Elizabeth Austin Lowance, a sister,
Mrs. George Lieben of Tucson, Ariz., and a brother, Franklin
Lowance of Williamsburg.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<TEXT>
   An outside counsel will investigate five
senators who intervened with banking regulators to help a political
contributor, a source says, indicating an intensified probe by the
Senate Ethics Committee.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity Thursday, did not
say whether a counsel had yet been hired to investigate the
senators, who aided Charles H. Keating Jr. when he was the chairman
of the failing Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.
   But the New York Times reported today the committee had decided
to hire prominent Washington attorney Robert S. Bennett for the
investigation, as well as for an unrelated review involving Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. A source says the Senate Ethics Committee
is reviewing allegations that D'Amato violated rules in the
Department of Housing and Urban Development scandal.
   Until now, the Ethics Committee's only known interest was a
letter asking the five whether Keating's contributions _ $1.3
million to the senators' campaigns or political causes _ prompted
them to question regulators about their examination of Lincoln.
   The senators are Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; John McCain, R-Ariz., and Donald
Riegle, D-Mich. Cranston responded to the committee Thursday as
DeConcini and Riegle did earlier, all denying any improprieties.
Glenn and McCain have not yet filed formal responses but have
denied wrongdoing.
   Also on Thursday, federal regulators handling the Lincoln S&amp;L
failure seized a luxury resort and a hotel in Arizona owned by
Keating.
   Bennett earlier this year was selected by the committee to
investigate accusations that Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn.,
laundered $100,000 in campaign contributions through a book
contract.
   The Ethics Committee does not formally announce a decision to
proceed from an initial expression of interest to the first formal
stage of a case known as a preliminary inquiry. The inquiry
determines whether there's a ``reason to believe'' rules violations
occurred.
   If the committee so decides, it would begin an initial review to
determine whether there is ``substantial credible evidence'' of
violations.
   The final step is a full investigation to decide if there is
``clear and convincing evidence'' that standards were violated, and
whether discipline should be recommended to the Senate.
   A standing Senate order says that Ethics Committee
investigations ``shall be conducted by outside counsel ... unless
the select committee determines not to use outside counsel.''
   The congressional watchdog Common Cause had urged the outside
counsel so that the results of the inquiry would be credible and
accepted by the public.
   Cranston, the Democratic whip, told the committee Thursday that
``no further action ... is warranted,'' in a formal response
prepared by his attorney.
   In an accompanying letter to committee Chairman Howell T.
Heflin, D-Ala., and Vice Chairman Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H.,
Cranston said his inquiries to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
about Lincoln were ``nothing more and nothing less'' than what he
has done for other constituents ``with credible complaints about
their treatment by a federal agency.''
   ``I am not responsible for loss of taxpayer funds through a
delay in shutting down Lincoln or the losses of innocent California
bond investors,'' Cranston said.
   Cranston's spokesman, Murray Flander, said he had no further
comment on the decision to hire a counsel adding, ``We have no
firsthand knowledge of it.''
   McCain's office issued a statement saying, ``I am confident that
an investigation will vindicate my repeated statements that I never
abused my office nor took actions that were improper.''
   Riegle said today, ``I strongly support whatever level of
inquiry the Senate Ethics Committee feels is appropriate. Their
review will show my conduct in this matter to have been ethical and
proper at all times.''
   DeConcini issued a statement saying, ``I welcome anything that
will establish the facts and I will cooperate fully.''
   Glenn's aide Dale Butland said in Columbus, Ohio, ``The senator
has not been ntified of this.''
   Cranston, McCain, DeConcini and Glenn met with then-Bank Board
Chairman Edwin Gray on April 2, 1987, and all five senators met a
week later with regional officials from the board's San Francisco
office about Lincoln.
   Cranston also phoned Gray's successor, M. Danny Wall, last
spring endorsing Keating's failed attempt to sell Lincoln before
regulators obtained a court order to seize it.
   Regulators seized control of Lincoln only last April. They
estimate taxpayers will have to cover between $2 billion and $2.5
billion in federally insured deposits the thrift lost in the
biggest S&amp;L failure in history. Regulators have filed a $1.1
billion fraud and racketeering suit against Keating and his
associates.
   In addition, hundreds of the 22,000 bondholders who bought
high-risk debentures in Lincoln's holding company, American
Continental Corp. of Phoenix, through Lincoln branches have sued
Keating after losing an estimated $200 million.
   In Arizona, the federal regulators, accompanied by FBI agents,
local police and private security guards, took control of the
Phoenician, a 605-room golf resort near Scottsdale, and the
344-room Crescent Hotel in Phoenix.
   Keating, his wife, Mary Elaine Keating, two daughters, two
sons-in-law and 18 other associates were fired from management
positions at the properties, owned by a subsidiary of Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association, Irvine, Calif.

   Federal agents are investigating allegations that
high-ranking police officials have diverted more than $1 million in
department funds for personal use, according to published reports.
   The probe focuses on the Police Department's drug forfeiture
fund, which contains cash and assets seized in drug cases, and the
secret service fund, which finances undercover operations and
payments to informants, the Detroit Free Press reported today. The
paper said its information came from sources familiar with the
investigation who spoke under condition of anonymity.
   Agents from the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S.
attorney's office are investigating, according to The Detroit News,
which also quoted anonymous sources today.
   The News said command-level officers told investigators they had
been told by their bosses to convert secret service assets to cash.
Agents are trying to determine who spent the money and how.
   Police Chief William Hart said Thursday that money had not been
misused by his department.
   ``If there was, we would make some arrests or be in the process
of investigating the persons that we believe abused the laws,''
Hart said.
   Neither U.S. Attorney Stephen Markman nor Hal Helterhoff, agent
in charge of the Detroit FBI office, would comment on the case.

   Law enforcers in the United States and Asia

<TEXT>
   On Aug. 4, 1988, a federal grand jury in
Manhattan handed up the nation's first indictment of Wall Street
professionals on racketeering charges, touching off a still noisy
debate.
   Should the fearsome penalties of the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, so successful in the government's war on
organized crime, be used against criminals of the financial world?
   ``Honest businessmen have nothing to fear from the RICO law,''
said Michael Goldsmith, a Brigham Young University law professor.
   Instead of worrying about RICO, with its stiff penalties and
threat of asset forfeiture, ``Wall Street ought to be saying,
`Let's come up with a remedy to our problems with fraud,'''
Goldsmith said.
   Added Joseph diGenova, former U.S. attorney for the District of
Columbia: ``No one seems to have a problem with applying RICO to
the Colombo (organized crime) family or the Genovese (organized
crime) family. They do have a problem, apparently, applying RICO to
people whose names don't end in vowels.''
   Passed by Congress in 1970, RICO was designed to make it easier
for prosecutors to root out mobsters by attacking seemingly
legitimate businesses associated with organized crime.
   Prosecutors can win a RICO conviction with unrelated crimes such
as loansharking or mail fraud if they can convince a jury those
charged were linked through a ``pattern of racketeering activity.''
The law did not define any new crimes.
   Defendants convicted of RICO violations are subject to maximum
penalties of up to 20 years in prison, hundreds of thousands of
dollars in fines and possible forfeiture of illegal profits into
the millions.
   It is RICO's forfeiture provisions that have caused most of the
uproar. Through them, prosecutors can obtain temporary restraining
orders to freeze a defendant's assets before trial to ensure the
funds are available in the event a jury orders them forfeited as
part of a verdict.
   Opponents of the law say it has been turned into a club to scare
defendants into plea bargains and cooperation agreements.
   ``It gives prosecutors a terrifying weapon,'' said Alan
Bromberg, a securities law expert at Southern Methodist University.
``I'm not sure our justice system should be getting people to plead
guilty when they don't feel they're guilty.''
   The case of Princeton-Newport Partners LP involved the first use
of the law against securities professionals. Last week, a federal
judge sentenced the six defendants to prison sentences of six
months or less.
   While the case achieved convictions, the prison time imposed was
minimal and the judge also reversed the jury's forfeiture verdict
against four defendants, ruling the harshness of the penalty did
not match the gravity of the crimes.
   The jury had awarded $3.8 million of the $21 million sought by
prosecutors in forfeitures.
   Rather than confirm the effectiveness of RICO in the prosecution
of securities cases, the judge's actions only highlighted the
problems inherent in the tactic.
   Defense lawyers contend the government's initial demands for an
order freezing the firm's assets, even though it was not charged
with wrongdoing, destroyed Princeton-Newport's ability to raise
money and forced it out of business.
   In response to such criticisms, the Justice Department recently
issued new guidelines for freezing RICO defendants' assets and also
sharply limited the use of racketeering charges in tax cases.
   The underlying crime charged in Princeton-Newport was mail fraud
for a phony stock-trading scheme to generate bogus tax losses.
   The Justice Department's tax division has since warned
prosecutors that Congress did not include tax offenses in the RICO
statute ``and charging a tax offense as a mail-fraud charge could
be viewed as circumventing congressional intent unless unique
circumstances'' exist.
   ``What could be more telling of the abusive nature of the
charges than the new Justice Department guidelines that there
cannot be another Princeton-Newport case?'' asked Paul Grand, a
defense attorney at the trial.
   Bruce Baird, former head of the securities fraud unit in the
Manhattan U.S. attorney's office that prosecuted Princeton-Newport,
said the case complied with guidelines in place at the time charges
were brought.
   In addition, he said, Princeton-Newport's assets were never
actually frozen. The firm failed, he believes, because of the
indictment itself _ not the battle over the assets.
   But Gerald Lefcourt, another defense lawyer in the case, said
that until a judge approved a bond to guarantee the defendants'
funds, the whole firm's assets were under a cloud.
   ``That's like restraining General Motors because the government
wants your 1,000 shares,'' he said.
   The racketeering law was used most prominently as a basis for
indicting some of the 48 people charged in Chicago's commodities
pits as well as former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond chief
Michael Milken. Total forfeitures against Milken and two
co-defendants could approach $12 billion.
   Drexel, then the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, last
year said it agreed to plead guilty to six felony charges and pay
$650 million in fines and restitution to avoid a racketeering
indictment that could have frozen its assets and crippled its
operations.
   ``There's no question RICO is effective,'' SMU's Bromberg said,
``but steamrollers are effective, too.''
   G. Robert Blakey, a University of Notre Dame law professor and
one of the architects of the RICO statute, said Drexel may have
lost far more if it had been convicted of racketeering.
   ``Drexel got a good deal _ just like a street offender who plea
bargains,'' he said.

   A decision by France to return three Mirage
fighter-bombers to Libya is raising concern at the State Department.
   The partial lifting of a French arms embargo was linked by the
department to an accord Libya signed in August for a peaceful
settlement in Chad.
   Libya and France were on opposite sides in a war in the African
country.
   The department said Libya is supporting rebels in violation of
an explicit prohibition in the agreement.
   Also, the department said in a statement distributed Friday,
Libya continues to pursue development of chemical weapons and to
support terrorism.
   France decided this week to return to Libya three Fench-made
supersonic Mirage fighter-bombers that had been held after being
returned to Aerospatiale factories for repairs in 1986.
   Foreign ministry sources in Paris, requesting anonymity, said
the return of the three aircraft _ one Mirage F-1 and two
Mirage-5's purchased in 1970 _ did not conflict with a decision by
the European Community in 1986 ruling out the delivery of new
armaments to Libya.
   The sources said the return of the planes was authorized
following the Aug. 31 agreement for a peaceful solution to the
border dispute between Libya and Chad.
   But the State Department said, ``We are quite concerned and
disappointed with this decision. We do not believe that now is the
time to weaken sanctions against Libya.''
   The statement said Libya had not demonstrated concrete changes
in its policies of supporting terrorism and destablization.

   Jurors convicted two former Oklahoma
football players of first-degree rape but found a third player
innocent today.
   Nigel Clay of Fontana, Calif., and Bernard Hall of Detroit were
found guilty late Thursday in the Jan. 21 rape of an Oklahoma City
woman at the school's athletic dorm. Jurors recommended 10-year
sentences and $10,000 fines for both.
   The jury foreman said Thursday the panel was split 9-3 on Glen
Bell, of Muskogee, without saying which way jurors were leaning.
The jury resumed deliberations this morning and after 1{ hours
returned the acquittal.
   Bell did not take the stand; his former teammates did.
   Bell's attorney, Charles Cox, was asked before today's verdict
was announced if he thought the fact that his client had not
testified while his former teammates took the stand had an impact
on the jury.
   ``It's pretty obvious that the jury didn't believe Nigel and
Bernard,'' Cox said. Hall and Clay had testified that they were not
in the dormitory room at the time.
   Cox added, ``I think everyone thought Glen was in the most risk
from the beginning.''
   The jury reached verdicts on Clay and Hall after hearing two
days of testimony and deliberating nearly 12 hours.
   On Tuesday, the woman testified that on the night of Jan. 21 she
was grabbed by someone as she came out of the bathroom in a suite
of rooms at the dormitory and was thrown to the floor in the
bedroom.
   She said she was raped at least three times and that other
attempts were unsuccessful. She told the court she could not
identify her attackers because it was dark in the room.
   Hall, Clay and Bell were suspended from the team and the
university when charges were filed in February, one of a series of
off-field incidents that rocked Oklahoma's football program.
   The state's key witness was a former teammate of the three
defendants who said he witnessed the rape.
   Several friends and relatives of Clay and Hall cried when
District Judge Preston Trimble read the guilty verdicts. The two
were taken to Cleveland County jail in handcuffs.
   Fred Shaeffer and Joel Barr, their attorneys, left the courtroom
without comment.
   ``I'm pleased with the jury's verdicts on the two defendants,''
District Attorney Tully McCoy said. ``It was a very difficult
case.''
   A solemn-faced Bell was hurried out of the courthouse after the
verdicts.
   The 20-year-old woman was not in the courtroom for the verdicts.
McCoy said she was informed of the verdict by phone.

   President Bush has sent a cable to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev expressing hopes for ``a calm and
peaceful period of change'' in Eastern Europe as democratic reforms
are adopted, the White House said today.
   The message echoed the theme of a cable that Gorbachev sent to
Bush last Friday.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the
president ``indicated his support for the changes in Eastern Europe
and the reforms under way in the Soviet Union.''
   ``He said the United States wants a calm and peaceful period of
change in Eastern Europe as Poland, Hungary and East Germany seek
to implement their reforms,'' the spokesman said.
   ``The president said he believes these historic steps will make
a positive contribution to a Europe that is whole and free,''
Fitzwater said.
   The message was dispatched to Moscow on Thursday evening and
will be delivered by U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock.
   The cable was written after a week of consultation between the
United States and Western allies.
   A week ago, Fitzwater had said that Gorbachev's message to Bush
``underscored the importance of the changes taking place and
expressed the hope that the situation will remain calm and
peaceful.''
   Bush and Gorbachev will meet Dec 2 and 3 on ships off the coast
of Malta for their first summit.
   Fitzwater said the dominant issue will be the changes in Eastern
Europe and their impact on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the Warsaw Pact and East-West relations in general.
   Bush talked by telephone today with President Francois
Mitterrand of France, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany about events in Eastern
Europe and the summit.
   Fitzwater said Bush and Mitterrand agreed to talk again after a
meeting of European leaders this weekend and before Bush sits down
with Gorbachev. Bush and Mulroney also said they would talk after
Malta.
   In preparation for the talks, Bush planned to confer at the
White House today with four former U.S. ambassadors to the Soviet
Union: George Kennan, Malcolm Toon, Thomas Watson and Arthur
Hartman.
   On Saturday, the president will hold two meetings with
think-tank experts and other Soviet specialists concerning domestic
politics in the Soviet Union and East-West relations in general.
   Fitzwater said the structure of the summit calls for general
discussions ``rather than specific of pinpoint kinds of proposals.''
   He said the United States was not concerned that Gorbachev might
spring a surprise on Bush, as he did with then-President Reagan
when he proposed sweeping arms cuts during the Reykjavik summit.
   Fitzwater said, ``Obviously, if President Gorbachev makes a
proposal, the president will say, `Well, that's very interesting,
why do you feel that way and what's your reasoning?'' and he'll
give him his points of view and his ideas and say, `We'll take
these matters up with the allies and we'll talk about them again at
our next summit.'''
   Fitzwater added, ``We don't anticipate any negotiating going on
there or the emergence of any specific agreements in any kind of
formal fashion.''

   Accepting defeat on their main abortion
battleground this year, pro-choice House members today set up
future fights by introducing a bill that would write into law the
1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.
   The bill also would, in effect, overcome a high-court decision
last summer that gave states greater leeway to impose restrictions
on abortions, supporters said.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a sponsor, said the bill would
forbid states to limit a woman's right to have an abortion before
the time her fetus becomes viable for life outside the womb.
   Although no action was expected until next year, abortion-rights
backers said the bill could become the central focus of future
congressional and political debate on the abortion issue _ and
could thrust the abortion issue even further into the 1990
congressional races.
   ``This bill is the moral equivalent for women of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore.
   A version also will be introduced in the Senate, supporters said.
   Abortion-rights supporters in the Senate on Thursday ended their
efforts to overcome President Bush's veto of a bill that would
extend Medicaid abortions to women who are victims of rape or
incest.
   ``I leave it on the conscience of the president that poor women
will continue to be denied their right of choice when they become
pregnant by an act of extreme sexual brutality,'' Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, said Thursday.
   The Senate followed the House by a day in acceding to Bush's
demands when he vetoed a bill that would have permitted federal
money to pay for Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims
of rape or incest.
   Both chambers gave voice-vote approval to a $157 billion
spending bill for labor, health and education programs that
included language insisted upon by Bush. It continues the
prohibition on federally financed abortions in all cases except
when the life of the mother is in danger and she cannot afford to
pay for the abortion.
   The president last month vetoed a similar version of the
appropriations bill that contained a provision expanding the
abortion financing to cover rape and incest. The House failed by 51
votes to override.
   Although the rape and incest provision would cover a relatively
small number of additional abortions, by most estimates, the issue
became a symbolic battleground in the political struggle over
abortion.
   That struggle has taken on increased intensity since the Supreme
Court last summer gave states more leeway to regulate abortions,
and proponents of abortion rights won key elections last week in
Virginia and New Jersey.
   The action ended for now the main congressional fight over
abortion, although there were other abortion-related skirmishes as
Congress pressed toward adjournment.
   In another abortion issue, a $14.6 billion foreign aid bill was
stymied by differences over a provision giving $15 million to the
U.N. Population Fund. The House reversed itself and voted down a
move by abortion opponents to strip the money out of the bill
because the agency operates in China, where a one-child-per-family
policy has led to forced abortions.
   Both sides also were watching to see whether Bush would sign or
veto a spending bill for the District of Columbia. He vetoed an
earlier version because it permitted funding of abortions. Congress
passed a new version that prohibits the D.C. government from using
federal money on abortions, but permits the city to use local money
for abortions.
   ``If he signs it, it will be a victory for us,'' AuCoin said.

   Twenty-two physicians learned that the FBI
``still makes house calls'' when agents arrested them for allegedly
trying to steal Medicaid money by prescribing expensive equipment
for nonexistent patients.
   The doctors, as well as several physician's assistants, office
managers, physician impersonators and a pharmacist, were accused of
demanding kickbacks in return for writing bogus prescriptions for
items such as oxygen tanks and wheelchairs.
   The distributor of such equipment _ in this case a businessman
who was working undercover for the authorities _ would then be free
to bill Medicaid for an item he never had to provide to a patient.
   William Doran, head of the criminal division of the bureau's New
York office, said such a scheme was ``as much a moral violation as
a legal violation. ... Fraud like this drives (Medicaid) costs even
higher.''
   Most of the physicians were arrested in a series of raids
Thursday by state and federal agents. ``They are now painfully
aware of the fact that the FBI still makes house calls,'' Doran
said.
   Kickbacks in the case ranged as high as $29,000, according to
U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney. Only one of those accused was a
first-time violator, he said.
   Edward J. Kuriansky, a state special prosecutor, said the
accused physicians, most of them foreigners, were part of ``an
influx of foreign nationals'' from places such as Pakistan,
Indonesia and Haiti ``who have come here principally to rip off the
Medicaid system.''
   Such doctors have few community ties and frequently flee before
they can be caught, he said.

   Parliament today ousted former Communist
Party leader Todor Zhivkov as head of state and replaced him with
Petar Mladenov, the new party leader, who promised radical
political and economic reforms.
   Lawmakers also approved a series of government changes that
drove out some hard-liners loyal to Zhivkov and put reformers into
positions of power.
   The lawmakers removed article 273 of the penal code, which was
broadly used to punish anyone deemed to have slandered the state or
Communist Party. This means that independent groups, which have in
the past have been harrassed by authorities, will have more freedom.
   The National Assembly also created an Ecology Ministry to
address enviornmental concerns raised by one of those groups,
Ecoglasnost.
   Today's moves, along with harsh criticism of Zhivkov, came
during the first live television broadcast of a Parliament session
in the history of Bulgaria.
   They continued the dizzying pace of reform that began in
Bulgaria on Nov. 10 when the hard-line Zhivkov was suddenly ousted
as party leader after a 35-year tenure and replaced by Mladenov,
who was the foreign minister.
   After the parliament meeting, 10,000 chanting Bulgarians
attended a state-sponsored rally in downtown Sofia to support the
leadership changes and call for Zhivkov to be tried in court.
   They loudly cheered lawmaker Slavcho Trnski, who launched an
unprecedented attack on Zhivkov during today's parliamentary
session.
   Mladenov, in his acceptance speech today, said he would
implement sweeping political and economic reforms, but he did not
give specifics.
   The ``new socialist Bulgaria'' will have more respect for
``rights and freedom for all Bulgarians,'' said Mladenov.
   The new leader also called on the unicameral Parliament _
traditionally, as in other Soviet bloc countries, a rubber-stamp
body for party decisions _ to take a more active role in
``controlling'' party and government work.
   Dropped from the government today were Petko Danchev, a deputy
premier, and Stoyan Ovcharov, minister of economy and planning.
Both were Zhivkov men, who were ousted as non-voting members of the
Politburo on Thursday.
   Stoyan Mihailov, a reformer who was removed from the Central
Committee and stripped of his ideology portfolio under Zhivkov last
year, was made minister of eduction and culture. The post could
prove to be important as Mladenov seeks to garner support from
intellectuals in carrying out reforms.
   Nikolai Dankerov was appointed to head the new Ecology Ministry,
an Voyko Dimitrov was named Mladenov's successor as foreign
minister.
   The 400-member National Assembly voted unanimously by a show of
hands to oust Zhivkov as head of state and to replace him with
Mladenov. Deputies praised Mladenov for his ``enthusiasm'' for
perestroika, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program.
   Trnski delivered a scathing attack on Zhivkov to the stunned
deputies, accusing the former leader of having led the country into
deep economic crisis while leading a ``flamboyant lifestyle.''
   He called for the ``real truth'' to come out about Zhivkov, who
he said owned 30 homes around the country. ``Not even the richest
countries in the world could stand those expenses,'' he said.
   He also charged that Zhivkov was ``hungry for fame'' and held
onto power by pursuing a policy of ``divide and rule.''
   Zhivkov often carried out personnel changes in the top party and
government echelons to consolidate his power.
   Trnski called for an investigation into what he described as
misuse of funds by Zhivkov's son Vladimir. He was purged from the
Central Committee Thursday and was rumored to be involved in
several scandals.
   Also Thursday, the Central Committee ousted three hard-line
Politburo members and promoted four liberal Communists, who are
expected to back Mladenov's reforms.
   In other changes today:
   _Andrei Lukanov, who was elevated to Politburo member and
Central Committee secretary Thursday, was relieved of his duties as
minister of foreign trade. Observers speculated he would be
Mladenov's No. 2 man in the party. His deputy, Georgi Pirinski,
replaced him.
   _Kiril Zarev was named minister of economics and Belcho Belchev
was named finance minister, a new post.
   _Mincho Yovchev, who was promoted to the Politburo on Thursday,
was named to head a new ministry of industry and technology.
   Under Zhivkov, this Balkan nation had been one of Moscow's most
loyal allies during the rule of former Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev. Despite a program outlined by Zhivkov in July 1987 which
seemed to call for reforms, little was done to implement them and
those who tried were removed from power.
   Mladenov is considered a well-connected politician with good
relations in Moscow, where he was educated. State media have said
Mladenov has already been in contact with Gorbachev, who greeted
his appointment as party leader.
   Mladenov has emphasized the continued leading role of the party
but at the same time has initiated direct dialogue with prominent
non-conformist intellectuals who belong to independent groups.
   He has moved quickly to secure his position in the party.
Informed sources said further top-level changes were expected in
the party and government to clear Communists loyal to Zhivkov's
rule.

   The animated chat about a shopping
spree just completed in the West came to a sudden halt as the
Nuremberg-Leipzig express crossed into East Germany.
   In the border zone where Communist guards with submachine guns
once shot to kill would-be escapees, the watchtower stood empty.
   As the train drew to a halt at Probstzella, the first stop in
East Germany, only a bearded man in a windbreaker, holding a
half-empty bottle of beer, kept talking.
   ``Any official check gives me an uneasy feeling, something like
going to the dentist,'' said a middle-aged woman returning from her
first trip to the West in 34 years. ``But maybe this time it will
be different.''
   It was. A smiling East German policewoman looked only passingly
at the identity papers. These included a passport, stamped with a
visa that authorized a reporter to make five days of unlimited
travel in East Germany.
   A second policeman followed, then a woman customs official.
   There were no questions, and no checks of the luggage, the
parcels and the shopping bags piled up to the compartment's ceiling.
   The police officer did not react when the man with the beer
bottle slapped him jokingly on the shoulder.
   ``They are completely insecure now,'' said the man later. ``They
have no instructions, so they just don't do anything.''
   ``It is really the new beginning,'' said a woman in her mid-30s,
peeling an orange as the train resumed its voyage.
   ``I still have my doubts,'' countered her neighbor. ``There are
too many Wendehaelse,'' she added, using a word that is used to
refer to turncoats.
   ``I feel a bit embarrassed,'' said another woman as the talk
returned to shopping.
   ``Taking those 100 marks ($54) `welcome money' makes you almost
feel like living on the dole,'' she said of the money provided the
visitors by the West German government.
   ``Don't worry,'' she was reassured. ``All that money stays in
West Germany anyway. But how will things look back here in the
East?''
   ``Prices will go up,'' replied a woman who said she was the wife
of a baker. ``We are told that bread will go up from 93 pfennigs to
2.80 marks in January.''
   East German marks are nominally equal in value to West German
marks, which are worth about 54 cents. But on the black market, or
at West German currency exchanges, the East German currency only
goes for one-tenth the nominal rate.
   ``It's evident,'' said another woman, ``that these subsidies
will have to go. Imagine, I pay 60 marks per month in rent for a
5{-room apartment.''
   ``And I paid 36 marks for a pair of designer stockings in the
Exquisit,'' chimed in another, referring to a state-owned chain of
East German luxury stores. ``It's completely crazy.''
   As the train rolled into Saalfeld, the bearded man emptied his
last bottle and put it carefully into the shopping bags, where it
joined several others. Empty bottles can be returned for five
pfennigs in East Germany.
   A woman said, ``I am homesick. It was an amazing experience in
this consumer temple. But now I am glad to be back.''
   The bearded man started singing what was once a popular tune,
``In der Heimat angekommen, faengt ein neues Leben an.''
   Back home, a new life begins.

   A quick stop for pastries cost $4,000
Friday when a car rolled from its parking spot and hit one
building, then changed direction and slammed into a restaurant. No
one was injured.
   ``I've been a policeman for five years and this by far and above
is the most unusual thing I've ever seen,'' said Patrolman Mark
Waggamon.
   Ramona Wagner, 52, of Wallace, parked in front of a bakery and
left her car's motor running while she went inside, Waggamon said.
   The transmission apparently slipped from park into reverse and
the car ``traveled backward and up the street across three lanes of
traffic and struck the front of the Galleria Mini Mall,'' the
patrolman said.
   He said the force of the collision then shifted the transmission
into either neutral or drive, and the car rolled off in another
direction.
   ``The car struck a newspaper vendor rack, which fell over and
hit a parked van, and traveled on eastward and through the front
window of McCrory's restaurant,'' Waggamon said.
   The buildings are within 75 yards of each other.
   Sandra Cunningham, 41, of Clarksburg, was the only person in the
restaurant.
   ``I was putting money in the cash register getting ready to open
up when the car came through,'' Cunningham said. ``I couldn't
hardly go anywhere. There was glass flying everywhere. All I could
do was stand and scream.''
   Wagner remained in the bakery during the incident. ``She didn't
even know it happened until she came out and said `That's my car,'
'' Waggamon said.
   He estimated damage to each store at $2,000, with just $100
worth of damage to the car. No charges will be filed.

   China's troubled attempt to control the largest
population on Earth will be further disrupted by its political
turmoil this year, a United Nations population expert said Friday.
   ``There has been quite a bit of slippage in delivery of the
(family planning) program since 1985,'' said Aprodicio Laquian,
director for China of the U.N. Population Fund.
   He said the slippage will accelerate following the military
crackdown on pro-democracy dissent in June, and ``there will be a
significant slowing down in the program.''
   Laquian said Chinese officials have become more bureaucratic and
cautious since then, requesting documents in triplicate for matters
that previously could be handled over the telephone.
   He said the new government's stress on central planning has had
an effect, citing the case of a U.N.-funded contraceptive factory
in the coastal city of Tianjin that had to close down because it
hadn't received a production target from Beijing.
   ``They can't buy materials and can't hire,'' Laquian said, with
the result that more than $1 million in U.N.-supplied equipment was
standing idle.
   He said some contraceptive factories were working only three
days a week because the government austerity program has cut them
off from raw materials and foreign exchange needed for imports used
in production.
   Laquian said the problems have not yet changed long-term
prospects for China's population, which the U.N. predicts will grow
from more than 1.1 billion at present to 1.285 billion in the year
2000.
   He said the U.N. estimate could be low. Chinese officials, who
originally hoped to hold the population to 1.2 billion, acknowledge
it could go as high as 1.3 billion in 2000 due to missteps in the
planning program.
   Laquian said China's ability to reduce the natural growth rate
from 2.4 percent to 1.4 percent in the past decade has been a
``fantastic accomplishment.'' But he said the program, based on the
one-child-per-family principle, has run into serious problems since
1985.
   A major factor in the rise in births in recent years is that the
360 million people born between 1962 and 1976 have reached
child-bearing age.
   Among other problems were the success of economic reforms,
giving peasants the money to pay fines for having extra children; a
``floating population'' of up to 50 million migrant workers who are
more difficult to monitor; a more sexually active young population;
and a breakdown in social and health services with the dismantling
of the communes.
   The health system ``is in disarray and deteriorating'' since
1985 because of the lack of a coordinated welfare system, Laquian
said. ``Barefoot doctors are leaving the profession in droves. They
can earn more raising chickens and pigs.''
   Another shortcoming is the poor quality of contraceptives
produced in China, he said. Intra-uterine devices used by 52
million women in China have a 10 percent failure rate, one reason
why there were 12.68 million abortions last year, more than one for
every two live births.
   Laquian also pointed to the relaxation of the one-child policy
since 1985, with some 19 different kinds of exemptions, including
permission for rural families whose first child is a girl to try
again for a boy.
   But he said that eight Chinese provinces experimenting with
two-child policies rather than insisting on one child per couple
have received more cooperation and obtained better results.
   Laquian said a five-year U.S. boycott on funding for the U.N.
program because of concern the money would contribute to forced
abortions has affected the political image of the program but has
not caused economic hardships.
   The organization's budget has risen from $136 million in 1985,
when the United States was the biggest donor with $36 million, to
$180 million in 1990 as a result of increased contributions from
Japan and Europe.
   About $10 million a year goes to China for contraceptive
production, maternal and child health care, population research and
educational programs.
   Laquian said the Chinese government officially opposes forced
abortion, but with 190,000 family planning workers and 13 million
volunteers and pressure from Beijing for good results, ``it's very
easy for local party officials to be overzealous.''
   He said female infanticide among peasants wanting sons appeared
to be ``very negligible'' although there was a tendency for girl
infants, who are regarded as less important than males, to be
neglected in breast-feeding and health care.
   Laquian said China's ability to feed one-fifth of the world's
population has been a great contribution to mankind, but that China
could lose that ability if it has 1.3 billion mouths to feed at the
end of the century, 100 million more than the original goal.
   ``That would be the first dam to break,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today formally proclaimed next
Thursday as Thanksgiving, then bestowed a ``presidential pardon''
on a noisy 50-pound turkey at an annual White House ceremony.
   ``Come on, this is serious stuff,'' Bush said as the squawking
turkey several times interrupted his Rose Garden speech marking the
200th anniversary of Thanksgiving proclamations.
   ``This annual observance of Thanksgiving was a cherished
American tradition even before our first president, George
Washington, issued the first presidential Thanksgiving proclamation
in 1798,'' said Bush's proclamation.
   As is the custom, Bush was presented with a live tom turkey by
the president of the National Turkey Federation, John Wickliffe,
and his wife Eleanor, from Detroit Lakes, Minn.
   Bush called the turkey ``our special guest'' and noted that the
first family's dog, Millie, who likes to chase squirrels and
pigeons on the White House grounds, ``has been put upstairs.''
   He said the gift turkey ``will not end up on anyone's dinner
table'' and was being granted a ``presidential pardon'' and sent to
a petting zoo in the Washington area.
   Bush then left the podium to pet the turkey, which was standing
on a table. He called two children from the audience to join him in
petting the bird, which was more subdued than it was during his
remarks.
   At a similar ceremony several years ago, the turkey lunged at
then-President Reagan. The following year, the turkey was sedated.
   This year's turkey was not sedated but was presented ``live and
kicking,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.

   Residents volunteered to give blood at
hospitals and schools were closed in mourning today after a
cafeteria wall collapsed in a violent wind, killing seven
elementary schoolchildren.
   School and town officials spent most of this morning in private
meetings. About 100 of the 150 town employees met to bring the
``family of this town together,'' said town supervisor Robert
Kirkpatrick.
   The wall, about 30 feet high and 50 feet wide, caved in on a
group of first-, second- and third-graders as they were eating
lunch Thursday at the East Coldenham Elementary School in Newburgh,
about 60 miles north of New York City.
   The wall was last inspected in 1984 and rotten wood was found
around some windows, Valley Central School Superintendent James
Coonan said today. But he said the rotting wood was replaced and
``it was as strong as it could be.''
   While school was closed today for about 4,000 students in the
district, Coonan said he was already worrying about next week,
``when we have seven funerals to deal with and children sitting
next to empty seats.''
   ``We're just overcome by this tragedy,'' said Bob Kirkpatrick,
supervisor of the town of about 23,000 residents.
   Between 113 to 125 students were eating in the cafeteria when
the brick, cinder-block and glass wall blew in, said police chief
John Kulisek. The dead and injured children were between 6 and 9
years old. Three children were in critical condition today.
   Kulisek said that witnesses reported a tornado, but the National
Weather Service said it had no evidence an actual twister was
responsible for the damage.
   Firefighters and police arrived at the scene of the disaster
within 15 minutes and began freeing children trapped under bricks
and cinder blocks.
   ``A lot of the kids were crushed,'' said Robert Markisello, one
of the first paramedics at the scene.
   Mayor Donald Presutti praised emergency workers, saying they
were ``treating this like they were members of their own families
... it was a very moving experience.''
   St. Luke's Hospital spokeswoman Debra Sgroe said many people
came to give blood to help victims. Crisis counselors were meeting
with parents at the hospital in rooms set aside for families of the
dead and injured.
   Police Lt. John J. Mahoney said he arrived at the school ten
minutes after the wall collapsed to find children calling out from
under the rubble.
   ``Some were screaming, some were lying there very quiet,''
Mahoney said. ``You could hear them under the debris calling for
help, calling `Take me home, take me home.'''
   The children were freed from the rubble within half an hour.
   Children wandered in a daze around the school grounds calling
for their parents, Markisello said.
   A woman arrived at St. Luke's shouting, ``I want my daughter, I
want my daughter!'' She later learned her child was not among the
dead.
   One boy who approached the wreckage saw food on some of the
tables and milk spilled on the floor.
   ``There's two lunch boxes still sitting there,'' 12-year-old
Shawn Dearborn said.
   State Education Department spokesman Christopher Carpenter said
the state would send counselors to help survivors deal with the
grief.
   ``There are two things we now have to deal with. One is the
physical aspect of getting the children into school. The second is
dealing with the emotional and psychological problems,'' he said.
   Carpenter said the state would send a structural engineer and an
architect to the site to help determine why the wall collapsed.

   The International Committee of the Red Cross said
Friday there is still no sign of its two relief workers kidnapped
in Lebanon six weeks ago, although it believes the men are not in
immediate danger.
   Red Cross delegate Andre Pasquier said the humanitarian
organization might withdraw its operations from Lebanon if Emanuel
Christen and Elio Erriquez remained in long-term captivity.
   The Red Cross stopped work two weeks ago in Sidon, the southern
city where the men were seized. The orthopedic center where
Christten and Erriquez helped fit artificial limbs closed
immediately after the Oct. 6 kidnappings.
   Pasquier told Swiss radio that Red Cross chief Middle East
delegate Angelo Gnaedinger had returned Wednesday from 10 days of
talks in the Lebanon. He said there was no clue to the identity of
the kidnappers and no signs of an early release for the two Swiss
workers.
   ``We believe the life of both men is not in immediate danger,''
Pasquier added.
   Another Red Cross delegate, Peter Winkler, was kidnapped a year
ago in Lebanon and released after one month in captivity. Death
threats after Winkler was freed prompted the Red Cross to leave the
country. It returned several weeks later after Lebanese factions
guaranteed there would be no more attacks on the organization.
   There are 18 Western hostages in Lebanon, most of them held by
Shiite Moslem factions loyal to Iran. They are eight Americans,
four Britons, two West Germans, an Italian, an Irishman and the two
Swiss.
   Held longest is American Terry A. Anderson, 42, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.

   More than half of East Germany's estimated
16.5 million people have obtained exit visas to visit the West in
the past week, the official news agency ADN reported Friday.
   The East German Interior Ministry said it has issued 9,592,237
visas since Nov. 9, when strict travel restrictions were lifted and
the government began opening new passages through the Berlin Wall
and other parts of its border, the agency said.
   Children under 14 do not need visas to travel with their parents.
   The ministry also announced it has issued 16,151 authorizations
to emigrate during that time, the agency said.
   West German officials say roughly 1 percent of the more than 3
million East Germans who have crossed the border are staying,
indicating that some at least are still emigrating without
obtaining the East German government's approval.
   Since the beginning of the year, about 200,000 East Germans have
moved to West Germany and West Berlin either legally or illegally.

   More than 100 miners were trapped
underground today when a fire blocked their way out of a coal mine
in central Yugoslavia, news reports said.
   The mine near Aleksinac, 120 miles south of Belgrade, was still
ablaze late in the afternoon, several hours after the fire broke
out in one shaft, the state Tanjug news agency said. State
television said 104 miners were trapped.
   The fire broke out at 1:30 p.m. and quickly cut off the main
access shaft of the mine, according to Tanjug.
   A mine official reached by telephone from Belgrade refused to
give additional information, but the mine's telephone operator said
that 40 miners had come out of the pit in the afternoon.
   It was not clear whether they were among those reported trapped.
   Rescue and medical teams were sent to Aleksinac from other mines
in the region, Tanjug said.

<HEAD>Easterners Warned: Quakes Can Happen Here</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Easterners should lose their complacency about
earthquakes because ``it can happen here,'' Rep. Sherwood Boehlert,
R-N.Y., warned Friday.
   ``The San Francisco quake brought home to all Americans the
power that such an event can unleash. But it may not have shaken us
from the complacency that views earthquakes as a West Coast
phenomenon,'' Boehlert said at a hearing on the hazards of quakes
east of the Rocky Mountains.
   The most severe earthquakes in the recorded history of the
United States occurred in the region of New Madrid, Mo., in
1811-1812, said Rep. John Tanner, D-Tenn.
   ``I don't want this hearing to instill stark terror in the minds
and hearts of the people who live there,'' Tanner said. ``However,
we must take this opportunity to appraise ourselves of that threat
and begin taking appropriate actions.''
   ``Funds invested today may be much cheaper than the money needed
to respond to devastation and destruction in the event of a major
earthquake in the central United States,'' said Tanner.
   Another great quake in the New Madrid area could affect the
heavily populated region from Memphis, Tenn., to St. Louis, Mo.,
disrupting transportation systems, natural gas and electric lines
and communications and endangering millions of lives, Tanner said.
   In addition, quakes in the East cause damage over a much wider
area than those along the West Coast because of differences in the
earth's crust, Dallas L. Peck, head of the U.S. Geological Survey,
told the House Science subcommittee on investigations.
   A repeat of the 19th century quakes in the New Madrid area could
have a devastating impact on residents of Missouri, Arkansas,
Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois, Peck said.
   And that area is not the only one in the East that faces a
threat _ serious tremors have occurred in the past in Charleston,
S.C., Boston, along the St. Lawrence River and in several other
eastern regions.
   The Geological Survey is establishing a network of seismological
stations in the East to help measure ground movement, Peck said.
   However, Arch C. Johnston of Memphis State University said funds
for earthquake research have dwindled in recent years. Adjusted for
inflation, federal quake spending now is only about 60 percent of
the 1980 level, he said.
   Johnston said tremors don't occur as often in the eastern states
as in the west. But the threat remains serious because easterners
are relatively unprepared for the quakes when they do come, people
are unaware of the dangers and there are few building codes
designed to ensure quake resistant structures, he said.
   The state of knowledge about the dangers of quakes in the east
is currently about the same as awareness of the dangers in
California before the great San Francisco quake of 1906, Johnston
said.

   The Flintstones and the Jetsons are headed
for the big screen and Yogi Bear will endorse a string of
``Jellystone Park'' campgrounds as Hanna-Barbera Productions tries
to diversify.
   David Kirschner, new president of the company that created
wise-cracking, mischief-making Yogi Bear and the stone-age
Flintstones, said he dreams of building a family entertainment
empire based on the classic cartoon characters.
   On Wednesday, he announced plans for full-length films,
television productions, theme park attractions and campgrounds _
all designed to revive Hanna-Barbera.
   ``Our goal is to show the industry that we are a player,'' said
Kirschner, who created the animated film ``An American Tail.''
   After the 32-year-old company peaked in the 1970s, it stood on
the sidelines while Walt Disney Co. and Muppet creator Jim Henson
reaped the financial fruits of cartoon diversification.
   One of the Hanna-Barbera's first projects will be a half-hour,
prime-time television version of ``An Animated Tail,'' to be
produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment with
Hanna-Barbera animators.
   The adaptation of the 1986 film that has grossed $165 million
will come to television after ``An American Tail II'' is released
in theaters during the 1991 Christmas season, Kirschner said.
   Also in the works are ``The Flintstones,'' a full-length film to
be released in fall 1991, ``Jetsons: The Movie!'' slated for
release next summer and a string of Yogi Bear Jellystone Park
Camp-Resorts.
   Kirschner, who joined Hanna-Barbera last month, said he
envisions the kind of diversification that turned around
once-stagnant Walt Disney Co.
   The diversification would include T-shirts and other retail
sales items emblazoned with the image of Fred Flintstone and many
of his old friends from the cartoon shows that brought
Hanna-Barbera early success.

   Four police cars rushed in, lights flashing,
and officers with guns drawn ordered the suspects out of their car
_ three women, one nine months pregnant, and two children, one a
3-year-old boy with a cap pistol.
   ``It was like Miami Vice,'' Kayron Foster, 31, of Salem, said
after the encounter at a U.S. Bank branch Wednesday. ``I thought
for a minute that they were going to shoot me.''
   Police who followed and then surrounded her car acted on a
reliable tip from a bank employee who apparently saw the boy's cap
pistol earlier and feared a robbery might occur, said Sgt. Dan Cary.
   But Foster said it was frightening and unnecessary.
   ``They could see the children bouncing around in the back when
they were following me,'' she said.
   Cary said it didn't take long for officers to realize that
Jessie Myers, toting a toy pistol, was not a bank robber.
   But Foster said police continued to treat them as suspects long
after it was apparent they were no danger to anyone. She said she
was handcuffed and her sister, Janet Easter, 20, whose second baby
was due Tuesday, was ordered to crawl across the car's gearshift to
get out of the front seat.
   Their younger sister, Diane Easter, 18; Foster's 12-year-old
son, Trace Mills; and Jessie, Janet Easter's son, were in the back
seat.
   ``When they saw a pregnant woman and a child step out, they
should have known,'' she said. ``They are supposed to be trained to
read people and situations.''
   Foster said she had driven to her bank but realized she had
forgotten her bank book. She drove home to get it and returned to
the bank.
   Meanwhile, the bank employee had seen the cap pistol and called
police.
   Sgt. Dan Smith defended the officers' actions, saying police
have no way of knowing what kind of situation they are entering.

   Peace talks between the Nicaraguan government
and the Contra rebels recessed for the weekend today after a
two-hour session that participants said failed to narrow
differences over terms for a cease fire.
   The negotiations will resume Monday afternoon.
   Officials from the rival factions met at mid-morning following
four hours of talks Thursday that left them looking exhausted and
disappointed that their efforts apparently had made little headway.
   Spokesmen for both sides said the principal sticking point was
the refusal by the Contras to agree to a Sandinista demand for the
withdrawal of rebel forces inside Nicaragua to base camps in
Honduras.
   The Sandinistas are linking their consent to a cease-fire to a
rebel withdrawal while the Contras are insisting on maintaining
their present positions once a truce goes into effect.
   One positive sign after the talks recessed was the absence of
kind of strident criticism of each other's position that
characterized their public comments 24 hours earlier.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, an official ``witness'' to the
discussions, left the talks Wednesday night to keep an appointment
elsewhere. He said he rejoined the negotiations Thursday night on
orders from the Holy See.
   After his departure Wednesday, the atmosphere for the
discussions deteriorated markedly.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros told reporters he had noted a
``hardening'' of the government's position on the cease fire.
   The chief rebel negotiator, Col. Enrique Bermudez, said the
Sandinistas showed no interest in agreeing to a cease fire as a
first step in a confidence building process.
   His Sandinista counterpart, Vice Foreign Minister Victor Hugo
Tinoco, said that for a ``real and effective cease-fire to take
place, the Contras should go back to their camps in Honduras.''
   There are an estimated 5,000 rebels inside Nicaraguan territory.
   Tinoco seemed mystified about the Contra refusal to return to
Honduras, noting that U.S.-supplied food and shelter is available
to them there.
   Beyond that, he said, the Contras could take their arms with
them back to Honduras and they would reserve the option to return
with their arms to Nicaragua if the peace process falters.
   The talks are being mediated by officials from the United
Nations and the Organization of American States. One official said
after the 10 p.m. recess that the negotiations were ``inching
along.''
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega suspended the cease-fire 17
days ago, citing what he said were repeated terrorist activities by
the Contra forces.
   Reviving the truce is considered an important goal because
national elections are set for Nicaragua on Feb. 25.

   Senate leaders today called on their
colleagues to approve a congressonal pay raise plan similar to the
$30,000-plus increase that just passed the House.
   ``It is a sound, reasonable, accountable piece of legislation,''
said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, citing ethics
reforms contained in the House legislation. ``It merits the support
of every senator.''
   ``It doesn't take any courage to vote against a pay raise,''
said Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``My view is if the voters in
our states look at what we do, if we work hard, have a complete
disclosure of our assets, our speaking fees, then they can make the
final judgment.''
   Mitchell and Dole made their statements after an unusual caucus
of both parties, behind closed doors, on whether to accept the pay
raise the House approved 252-174 Thursday for itself and other top
government officials.
   The leaders said the essential elements of the House package
would remain in the Senate proposal, including the elimination of
speech honoraria as a source of outside income for lawmakers.
   The House voted to raise its pay, and that of government
executive and federal judges, by more than 35 percent in less than
14 months. House salaries would soar from the current $89,500 to
more than $120,000.
   With the higher pay, House members would be barred beginning in
1991 from pocketing honoraria checks for speeches before interest
groups. They also would be subject to other new rules in the first
major overhaul of its ethics rules in 12 years.
   The House plan doesn't include a raise for the Senate unless the
Senate votes to include itself. Dole and Mitchell did not say
whether their proposal would make it identical.
   Enemies of the pay raise were trying to turn up the pressure
against it. Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate who helped kill a
proposed 51 percent pay raise just 10 months ago, called the new
plan a ``legislative pay-grab wolf in a minor ethical reform
sheep's clothing.''
   The Senate could vote to give itself no raise but let the House
and others get theirs. Or it could buy into the whole deal, kill it
or choose something in between.
   ``The leadership is pushing hard for us to adopt the House
package,'' Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said Thursday. ``Apparently,
it must be a close vote.''
   Mitchell has said he favored the House plan but speculated the
Senate might go for a more modest pay package and a more gradual
elimination of honoraria.
   Senators now may keep speaking fees equal to 40 percent of their
salaries, compared to 30 percent in the House, so the House plan
actually could be an income cut for some senators. The Senate also
has its own ideas about ethics rules, including restrictions on
lobbying after lawmakers leave office.
   The House plan would raise salaries in a series of steps, for a
total minimum 35 percent raise by Jan. 1, 1991. On top of that,
lawmakers and the other officials would get whatever cost-of-living
adjustment is given to rank-and-file government workers on that
date.
   President Bush, eager to raise pay for his top staff and the
federal judges, has already said he would sign the bill.
   House members who took the politically unpopular plunge and
voted for the pay raise Thursday were watching the Senate's moves
carefully, for fear the other chamber would kill it.
   ``The Senate in the next 24 hours needs to think about what is
politically possible,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., co-chairman
of the task force that drafted the House plan.
   Another House Democrat said the pressure his chamber would put
on the Senate would approach ``white heat.''
   In a similar situation seven years ago, the Senate let the House
scoot ahead in salary. But senators reconsidered six months later
and gave themselves a catch-up raise.
   Besides the ban on keeping honoraria, the House bill includes a
broad range of changes in its rules and in federal ethics law.
   Outside earnings besides honoraria would be limited to 15
percent of salary and severely restricted in scope. Rules governing
the acceptance of gifts and travel from people outside the
immediate family would be tightened.
   The rules also would require more detailed disclosure of
personal assets.
   The most recent congressional pay raise was in 1987, and it
hasn't been raised since then primarily because members fear the
political consequences.

   A propane fire shot flames at least 100 feet
into the air and prompted the evacuation of about 500 people before
it was put out late this morning.
   No injuries were reported in the blaze, which began Thursday
morning, lighting up the southwest Missouri sky and visible at
least 25 miles away.
   Charlotte Coates, a Jasper emergency services dispatcher,
estimated that 500 people from the town of 1,100 had to leave their
homes overnight.
   ``I would say the flames are 100 to 150 feet in the air,'' she
said at the height of the fire. ``You can see it from all over.
It's like in the movies.''
   The fire at a Williams Pipe Line Co. terminal about two miles
south of Jasper fed on a 17-acre underground storage cavern,
burning propane at the rate of 300 gallons an hour, said Ray
Pullen, a Williams official.
   Jim Gipson, a company spokesman, said the cavern fire was
extinguished late this morning, but some small fires remained from
nearby pipeline valves.
   Kenneth Graham, a Williams executive from Houston, arrived early
today to coordinate the effort to put out the fire, said Judy
Johnson, civil defense director for Joplin and Jasper County.
   About 20 tanker loads of water were trucked in during the night.
   Highway 71, which runs north and south through the middle of
Jasper, was closed in both directions, the Jasper County Sheriff's
Department said. A rail line was closed and aircraft were warned
not to fly in the area.
   Evacuated residents were asked to go to nearby Carthage and
Lamar, and Williams bused some people to hotels in Joplin, about 10
miles south of Jasper.
   The fire started as a work crew was performing routine
maintenance on a pump, said Gipson. Propane escaped and somehow
ignited when it reached the surface, Gipson said.
   An attempt was made Thursday to stop the fire by injecting 2,000
gallons of water into the cavern, but the gas erupted again to
shoot flames 200 feet into the sky.
   Officials then decided to order the evacuation and let the fire
burn through the night until Graham and other company fire control
experts arrived.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador said today
he will personally investigate the brutal massacre of six Jesuit
priests, and he offered protection to any witnesses who come
forward to testify.
   Hours after the killings Thursday, uniformed security officers
raided a Lutheran Church office and arrested 12 missionary workers,
including four Americans, a Canadian consular official said.
   Also today, sporadic fighting was reported six days after
leftist rebels launched their biggest offensive in a 10-year-old
civil war. A British journalist was wounded in cross-fire between
rebels and government troops in the Mejicanos district of San
Salvador and later died in a hospital.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker said the United States is
pressuring the right-wing government of President Alfredo Cristiani
to investigate the killings of the six Jesuit priests, their cook
and her daughter.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the United States would closely monitor the Salvadoran government's
investigation of the killings but did not plan to assist in the
inquiry.
   Walker, however, offered protection to citizens providing
information. He also said in an interview, ``I will try to find and
solicit the testimony of people who are or who claim to be
witnesses.''
   He said he planned to contact officials at the Jesuit university
who have said two witnesses saw about 30 men in army uniforms enter
the priests' residence just before the shooting began.
   He described the massacre as a ``blot on the image'' of El
Salvador's government that could only be erased by a full
investigation and punishment of the guilty.
   The government, which relies heavily on U.S. aid, denied
responsibility and said the murders were ``savage and irrational.''
   The Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit Provincial for Central
America, said the victims were tortured before they were slain.
Although the bodies were found mutilated, the torture allegations
have not been confirmed.
   Tojeira said terrified witnesses had gone into hiding and did
not trust authorities because troops were implicated in the
killings.
   El Salvador only recently emerged from a period of repression
during which death squads and rightist elements of the military
were accused of killing thousands of people. The Salvadoran right
considers church activists and church intellectuals to be
subversives.
   An annual reported presented today at the United Nations said
accused El Salvador's government of presiding over a ``resurgence
of torture'' this year and a crackdown on trade unions and
organizations.
   The annual report by Jose Antonio Pastor Ridruejo, a special
representative of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, criticized
both the government and rebels for kidnappings and assassinations.
   Cristiani, who took office June 1, told reporters Thursday the
government was not involved in the priest slayings and that he had
ordered an investigation. ``The killers will jeopardize further the
critical situation in our country,'' he said.
   The guerrillas of the leftist Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, who have been waging a 10-year-old war with the
government, called the slayings an ``absurd massacre.''
   Uniformed security officers on Thursday raided a downtown office
of the Lutheran Church and arrested 12 missionary workers, said
Michel Gagne, a consular officer at the Canadian Embassy.
   He said they were being detained at Treasury Police
headquarters. Police refused to confirm the report.
   The detainees included four U.S. citizens, a Canadian, and a
Spaniard. The rest were West Germans.
   The Americans were identified as Paula Brentlinger, a physician
from Seattle; Thomas Gabriel, a nurse from Seattle; Bradley Fields,
a social worker from San Diego; and Paul Fitch, a U.S. volunteer
whose hometown was not known.
   The Rev. William Dexheimer, a pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church of America, said he had received a telephone call Tuesday
threatening him with death if he didn't leave. After the slayings
Thursday, he flew home to Florida.
   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II today decried the murder of
the Jesuits, calling it an act of ``abominable violence'' in a
telegram to the archbishop of San Salvador, Monsignor Arturo Rivera
Damas.
   Rivera Damas compared the killings to the slaying of his
predecessor, Oscar Arnulfo Romero, in March 1980. Romero had been
denouncing years of killings by right-wing death squads and
kidnappings by guerrillas.
   On Dec. 2, 1980, troops killed U.S. Maryknoll nuns Ita Ford and
Maura Clarke, Ursuline sister Dorothy Kazel and lay worker Jean
Donovan.
   More than 800 people have died and twice as many have been
wounded since government forces and the guerrillas began fighting
Saturday, according to reports by the military and hospitals.
   Michael Blundy, 44, a correspondent for a British newspaper, the
Sunday Correspondent, died at Rosales Hospital where he had been
rushed by fellow reporters after he was shot in the shoulder today.
British vice-consul Adele Taylor said Blundy's body will be sent to
London for burial.
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, the armed forces chief of staff, late
Thursday appealed to people to return to work. But a dusk-to-dawn
curfew, a state of siege declared by the government and a ban on
traffic decreed by the rebels made it seem doubtful many would heed
his call.
   The guerrillas are estimated to have 7,000 full-time fighters
and 11,000 backups nationwide. The guerrillas are heavily
outnumbered by the 56,000-strong Salvadoran army and other security
forces.

<HEAD>Air Force Says This Model is `Not Your Normal Fax'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force is defending its purchase of 173
custom-made facsimile machines under contracts that amount to $73
million, contending Friday they are ``not your normal fax,'' and
are designed to withstand the dirt, havoc and extremes of
battlefield duty.
   The service was inundated with queries about the machines after
a published report said they cost the Air Force $421,000 apiece, a
figure computed by dividing the $73 million cost by 173.
   Air Force spokesman Maj. Lou Figueroa disputed the figure,
saying the service was paying $76,000 for each unit.
   He said the machines were being purchased from Litton Industries
under a contract for $33 million, and that an additional contract
for some $40 million covers ``a very extensive list'' of diagnostic
equipment, laser assemblies, and other items such as power
supplies, training for use of the units, and the paper _ which
costs $100 a roll.
   Figueroa said the high cost of paper was due to the fact that it
came in 400-foot rolls and is specially coated to handle the
high-resolution images the machine is designed to transmit.
   The spokesman said the custom-made units were ordered to
withstand the rigors of the battlefield, and to be used under a
variety of conditions that might be encountered in wartime.
   ``This isn't just a normal fax that sits in your office and does
its thing,'' Figueroa said. ``These are not machines made to sit in
a wing commander's office. They are designed to be deployed off a
dirt runway,'' he said.
   He said the machines, which weigh about 115 pounds and are the
size of a ``small, compact television,'' are built to transmit
sensitive intelligence data over a variety of phone lines.
   The data can be transmitted in what is called in military jargon
as ``near, real time,'' which means almost instantaneously, he said.
   ``We are talking about a machine that is capable of allowing a
commander in a battle field situation, who is managing fighter
aircraft, to get transmissions from satellites to tell him what
targets are out there that need to be taken out,'' Figueroa said.
   The average fax machine in an office ``would not be sufficient''
for such a task, the spokesman said.
   ``We are talking wartime conditions. We are talking about
targets that may or may not be camouflagued. We need high quality
resolution for this type of imagery,'' he said.
   Figueroa said the unit was ordered so that it could operate
anywhere in the world, at any time, and with a variety of power
sources, such as batteries, power generators or commercial power
sources from around the world.
   It is able to withstand dust, rain, sand and salt, work in
temperatures from minus 25 degress to 125 degrees Fahrenheit, and
work over public telephone lines as well as the military phone
lines protect sensitive information from electronic eavesdroppers,
he said.

   Here is the text of President Bush's
Thanksgiving Day proclamation, issued Friday.
   On Thanksgiving Day, we Americans pause as a nation to give
thanks for the freedom and prosperity with which we have been
blessed by our Creator. Like the pilgrims who first settled in this
land, we offer praise to God for His goodness and generosity and
rededicate ourselves to lives of service and virtue in His sight.
   This annual observance of Thanksgiving was a cherished American
tradition even before our first president, George Washington,
issued the first presidential Thanksgiving proclamation in 1789.
   In his first inaugural address, President Washington observed
that, ``No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the
Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of
the United States.'' He noted that the American people _ blessed
with victory in their fight for independence and with an abundance
of crops in their fields _ owed God ``some return of pious
gratitude.''
   Later, in a confidential note to his close adviser, James
Madison, he asked, ``Should the sense of the Senate be taken on ...
a day of Thanksgiving?''
   George Washington thus led the way to a joint resolution of
Congress requesting the president to set aside ``a day of public
Thanksgiving and Prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with
grateful hearts the many and signal Favors of Almighty God.''
   Through the eloquent words of President Washington's initial
Thanksgiving proclamation _ the first under the Constitution _ we
are reminded of our dependence upon our Heavenly Father and of the
debt of gratitude we owe to Him.
   ``It is the duty of all Nations,'' wrote Washington, ``to
acknowledge the Providence of Almighty God, to obey his Will, to be
grateful for his Benefits, and humbly to implore His Protection and
Favor.''
   President Washington asked that on Thanksgiving Day the people
of the United States:
   ``Unite in rendering unto (God) our sincere and humble Thanks
for his kind care and Protection of the People of this Country
previous to their becoming a Nation; for ... the great degree of
Tranquility, Union and Plenty which we have since enjoyed; for ...
the civil and religious Liberty with which we are blessed, and ...
for all the great and various Favors which he hath been pleased to
confer upon us.''
   Two hundred years later, we continue to offer thanks to the
Almighty -- not only for the material prosperity that our nation
enjoys, but also for the blessings of peace and freedom. Our nation
has no greater treasure than these.
   As we pause to acknowledge the kindnesses God has shown to us _
and, indeed, His gift of life itself _ we do so in a spirit of
humility as well as gratitude. When the United States was still a
fledgling democracy, President Washington asked the American people
to unite in prayer to the ``great Lord and Ruler of Nations,'' in
order to:
   ``Beseech him to pardon our national and other Transgressions;
to enable us all, whether in public or private Stations, to perform
our several and relative Duties properly and punctually; to render
our national Government a Blessing to all the People, by constantly
being a Government of wise, just and constitutional Laws,
discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed; to protect and guide
all Sovereigns and Nations...and to bless them with good
Government, Peace and Concord.''
   Today, we, too, pause on Thanksgiving with humble and contrite
hearts, mindful of God's mercy and forgiveness and of our continued
need for His protection and guidance.
   On this day, we also remember that one gives praise to God not
only through prayers of Thanksgiving, but also through obedience to
His commandments and service to others, especially those less
fortunate than ourselves.
   While some presidents followed Washington's precedent, and some
state governors did as well, President Lincoln _ despite being
faced with the dark specter of civil war _ renewed the practice of
proclaiming a national day of Thanksgiving. This venerable
tradition has been sustained by every president since then, in
times of strife as well as times of peace and prosperity.
   Today, we continue to offer thanks and praise to our Creator,
that ``Great Author of every public and private good,'' for the
many blessings he has bestowed upon us. In so doing, we recall the
timeless words of the 100th Psalm:
   ``Serve the Lord with gladness: come before His presence with
singing.
   ``Know ye that the Lord He is God: it is He that hath made us,
and not we ourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of his
pasture.
   ``Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts
with praise: be thankful unto Him, and bless His name.
   ``For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting; and His truth
endureth to all generations.''
   NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States
of America, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 23, 1989, as a
National Day of Thanksgiving, and I call upon the American people
to gather together in homes and places of worship on that day of
thanks to affirm by their prayers and their gratitude the many
blessings God has bestowed upon us and our nation.
   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth
day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and
eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of
America the two hundred and fourteenth.
   
   GEORGE BUSH

   A secret plan allowing the CIA to encourage a
coup against Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega was approved by the
administration despite congressional objections to overthrowing
foreign leaders without a clear threat to U.S. security,
intelligence sources said Friday.
   The plan was presented about three weeks ago to congressional
overseers in a presidential legal document known as a ``finding,''
the sources said.
   House Intelligence Committee Chairman Anthony Beilenson,
D-Calif., and two others on the 19-member panel, Matthew McHugh,
D-N.Y., and Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., responded with a letter of
objection to President Bush, said government sources who spoke only
on condition of anonymity.
   When a president tells Congress of such a plan and presents a
legal finding, lawmakers have no direct power to deny him though
members can make whatever case they see as appropriate if they
disagree.
   Neither Beilenson nor McHugh would comment on the letter Friday.
Calls to Kastenmeier's office seeking comment were not immediately
returned.
   Some officials suggested privately that the U.S. government
might not have been upset to see the covert plan publicly leaked.
Asked about it on Thursday, Bush said he would neither confirm nor
deny such a plan existed.

<TEXT>
   A U.N. envoy trying to restart the peace
talks between Iran and Iraq failed to break the deadlock but
scheduled more meetings next month, Iranian media said Friday.
   Jan Eliasson ended his 17-day shuttle and left Tehran for New
York, the Islamic Republic News Agency said, and Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani blamed the mission's failure on Iraq.
   Rafsanjani said Iraq was still not ready to accept U.N.
Resolution 598, a plan aimed at reaching a peace accord between the
two counties that ended eight years of fighting nearly 16 months
ago.
   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Eliasson as saying he arranged
for separate meetings between the foreign ministers of the two
countries and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar in New
York next month.
   ``Not surprisingly, the positions (of Iran and Iraq) are in some
respects wide apart,'' he told the news agency. He declined to
elaborate.
   Eliasson said Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and his Iranian
counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, would meet separately with Perez
de Cuellar.
   In a statement released in Iran and Iraq on Thursday, Eliasson
said he had 12 meetings with officials of both countries focusing
on how to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 598.
   ``In the course of my talks with the representatives of both
governments, I suggested ways to move the talks forward within the
framework of Resolution 598 in order to achieve a comprehensive and
lasting peace in the region,'' he said.
   The resolution, which halted the eight-year war on Aug. 20,
1988, calls for troop withdrawals to internationally recognized
borders, the exchange of prisoners of war and a settlement of the
conflict through U.N.-sponsored negotiations.
   Rafsanjani, in a Friday prayer sermon, said Iraq's insistence
that a release of prisoners of war should come before other parts
of Resolution 598 was a ``mere excuse'' by Baghdad for failing to
carry out the resolution.
   The Iranians want the resolution to be followed point-by-point
in the order listed in the document, insisting the first step
should be an Iraqi withdrawal from Iranian territory they seized in
the final weeks of the war.
   The exchange of POWs should come next, followed by clearing war
debris from the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, Iraq's main outlet to the
gulf.
   ``Obviously both sides are against the resumption of the war
under any circumstances,'' Rafsanjani said.
   But he stressed that Iranians should remain vigilant: ``We have
to preserve our (combat) readiness.''
   Among the sticking points in the talks has been Iraq's claim on
the Shatt-al-Arab waterway which formed part of the frontier
between the two nations before the war. The Iraqis want the border
redrawn to include all of the strategic waterway in Iraqi territory.
   An estimated 100,000 POWs are held by both sides and Iraq has
offered that they be swapped outside the framework of the
resolution. Iran refused, insisting on an Iraqi withdrawal first.

   A computerized pilot project to improve news
coverage and public awareness of decisions by the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals was announced Friday by the court and the American
Society of Newspaper Editors.
   The court _ which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee
_ and the society have both hired courthouse liaisons to serve as
contact people for the public and reporters.
   The joint project also has equipped the Cincinnati-based court
with a computer system that will enable news organizations, lawyers
and anyone else with a compatible computer to dial in and get
access to the court's decisions, docket information and advisories
of upcoming cases.
   The computer's ``electronic bulletin board'' will provide a
review of the court's decisions from the previous two weeks,
advance notice of newsworthy proceedings and telephone numbers of
lawyers. It will carry full texts of rulings the day they are
rendered by the court.
   Judge Gilbert S. Merritt, who joined the appeals court in 1977
and began a seven-year term as its chief judge Oct. 1, has been
working on the project with ASNE officials.
   Merritt announced Friday that the court's new public information
officer is Debra A. Nagle, who will manage the bulletin board and
the court's monthly newsletter. She has been an associate editor of
Ohio Law, a monthly newspaper for lawyers, and editor of the
Vandalia Chronicle, a suburban Dayton weekly.
   In September, the American Society of Newspaper Editors hired
James Delaney, former metro editor of The Cincinnati Enquirer
newspaper, as director of the pilot project.
   Only two other higher-level federal courts nationally employ
public information officers: the Supreme Court and the San
Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``The intent of this project is to see what we can do to make
sure the critically important decisions of the court are made
available to the public,'' said David Stolberg, assistant general
editorial manager of newspapers for Scripps Howard.
   Stolberg, a member of ASNE's press, bar and public affairs
committee, helped design the project and said press and bar
officials in other parts of the country are monitoring its progress.

   A tornado tore apart an upstate New York school cafeteria wall,
killing seven children, a meteorologist concluded today after
studying the violent storms that caused damage, flooding and at
least 11 deaths in the Northeast.
   Thursday's storms came from the system that spun off tornadoes
in eight states in the South and Midwest on Wednesday. The two-day
toll: at least 29 dead and hundreds injured, including 17 dead and
1,000 homeless in Huntsville, Ala., and a death in Canada.
   President Bush today issued a disaster declaration for tornado
victims in Huntsville, making the city eligible for federal relief
programs, said Gov. Guy Hunt's press secretary, Terry Abbott.
   Hunt said he believed damage exceeded $100 million, although
teams assessing the destruction were not expected to come up with a
figure until later.
   Authorities and witnesses in Newburgh, N.Y., about 60 miles
north of New York City, said it appeared a tornado was responsible
for the death and destruction at East Coldenham Elementary School.
   Roland Loffredo, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather
Service's Albany office, examined the damage this morning and said
it and the eyewitness acounts led him to believe a strong tornado
caused the disaster.
   The brick, cinder block and glass wall, about 30 feet high and
50 feet wide, caved in on as many as 125 first-, second- and
third-graders as they were eating lunch, said Town of Newburgh
Police Chief John Kulisek.
   The wall was last inspected in 1984 and rotting wood was
discovered around some windows, said Valley Central School
Superintendent James Coonan.
   ``As part of our ongoing renovation, the defective wood was
replaced five years ago,'' he said. Afterward, he said, ``it was as
strong as it could be.''
   Besides the seven killed, 18 children were injured, three
critically. All the victims were 6 to 9 years old.
   Town of Newburgh police Lt. John J. Mahoney said he arrived 10
minutes after the wall collapsed to find children calling out from
under the rubble.
   ``Some were screaming, some were lying there very quiet,''
Mahoney said. ``You could hear them under the debris calling for
help, calling `Take me home, take me home.'''
   District schools were closed today, and school officials were
assembling counselors to help pupils when classes resume Monday.
   Kulisek said an investigation would begin today into why the
wall collapsed.
   A tornado knocked over trees and ripped roofs off houses in West
Virginia's Eastern Panhandle, the National Weather Service
confirmed. Storms also caused flooding in Washington, D.C., blew
windows out of skyscrapers in Philadelphia, destroyed a house in
Piscataway, N.J., and overturned cars and blew the roof off a
shopping mall in Quebec.
   The weather service also confirmed a second tornado Thursday, in
Montgomery County in southeastern Pennsylvania. It ripped the roof
off a building housing federal offices in King of Prussia, causing
four minor injuries.
   A truck driver died when his tractor-trailer overturned in high
winds on a bridge connecting Elizabeth, N.J., and New York City. A
New York City woman died after being hit by a steel beam blown off
a water tower. A Camden, N.J., man died when winds picked him up
and smashed him to the ground, authorities said.
   Quebec provincial police suspected a tornado was responsible for
widespread damage in St. Hilaire, a small community southeast of
Montreal.
   Winds of more than 124 mph blew the roof off a shopping mall,
overturned cars, shattered windows, knocked down trees and hurled
mailboxes hundreds of yards in the center of St. Hilaire, a town
official said.
   In Richmond, just east of St. Hilaire, a man was killed when his
car was hit by a school bus during the high winds, Quebec
provincial police official Bertrand Fortin said.
   The storm system, churning around a collision of record warm air
and extremely cold air, also was blamed for one death Wednesday in
Alorton, Ill. Gov. James R. Thompson said Thursday he would seek
federal disaster aid for the southern Illinois town.
   In Huntsville, the tornado covered between eight and 10 miles
with wind speeds as high as 250 mph. ``It's like taking six to 10
city blocks and putting them in a blender and putting it on
liquefy,'' said rescue worker Bob Caraway.
   Winds of up to 100 mph blew out windows in Philadelphia
skyscrapers and tore a hole in the roof of the l at
Philadelphia International Airport.
   Winds brought down power lines and damaged generating stations,
leaving at least 180,000 customers temporarily without electricity
in PennsylvaOverseas Terminania, New York and eastern Connecticut, utility
officials said.

   Vanity, thy name is Eddie Murphy!
   Reaching new levels of self-promotion, Murphy's name is
trumpeted across the screen five times in the opening credits for
the comedian's new movie ``Harlem Nights,'' which opened Friday.
   ``Paramount Pictures presents in association with Eddie Murphy
Productions a film by Eddie Murphy,'' the credits read. ``Starring
Eddie Murphy ... executive producer Eddie Murphy ... written and
directed by Eddie Murphy.''
   During the film's media screening in Los Angeles earlier this
week, laughter rippled through the theater as the Murphy barrage
reached for its five-count crescendo.
   ``Harlem Nights'' features Murphy and Richard Pryor in a
foul-mouthed, violence-filled look at a 1938 nightclub in Harlem.
The film marks Murphy's feature directorial debut.
   As prominent as Murphy's name is in the film, the newspaper
advertisement goes one better: Murphy's name appears six times.

   Actor Sir John Gielgud paid tribute Friday to the
``youth and exquisite beauty'' of Princess Diana as she presided
over his installation as the first honorary fellow of the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art.
   The princess, whose husband Prince Charles is heir to the
throne, is president of the prestigious drama school, and leading
actors including Suzannah York and Sir Richard Attenborough were on
hand for the ceremony, along with present-day students.
   ``My career has been marvelously lucky. I only hope that many of
you will succeed as I have been lucky enough to do,'' said Gielgud.
   Gielgud entered the academy on a scholarship in 1922 and was its
president until his 85th birthday earlier this year. Princess
Diana, 28, succeeded him.
   Gielgud referred to the two new appointments _ himself as fellow
and she as president _ as ``venerability and wisdom'' on one hand
and ``youth and exquisite beauty'' on the other.
   ``I was a very bad president,'' Gielgud told the audience.
   Attenborough, chairman of the academy's council, described him
as ``in truth, one of the greatest actors of all time.''

   Marilyn Quayle said the United States wasn't
prepared after Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake with
lists of businesses to donate emergency supplies.
   The wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, who has made disaster
preparation and relief her main project, spoke Thursday during a
tour of a Red Cross hospital. She also talked with officials from
government civil protection and disaster agencies.
   ``We found we were in need of having already established lists
of businesses and what they could donate,'' Mrs. Quayle said of the
two recent U.S. disasters. Such lists are now being prepared, she
said. And Assistant Interior Secretary Emilio Rabasa Gamboa said
Mexico is doing the same.
   During her tour, two men wearing the red uniforms of the
``moles'' described how their group was created after volunteers
spontaneously began burrowing into the rubble of collapsed
buildings after the 1985 Mexico City earthquakes and evolved into a
permanent rescue organization.
   ``I would hope in doing research if you find anything different
in dealing with disasters ..., we can share our findings so we can
be better prepared,'' Mrs. Quayle said.
   ``It is very important that ... natural disasters don't
necessarily have to be human disasters.''

<HEAD>Right-Wing Israelis, Doctors Protest Israeli-Arab Transplant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The transplant of a heart to a Palestinian from
an Israeli soldier killed by Arab guerrillas has angered right-wing
Israelis who called it a reward for violence.
   ``The Arabs cut out our hearts literally, and we give them ours.
We're outraged that the murder of Jews means so little in the
Jewish land,'' said Shifra Hoffman, who represents a group of
victims of Palestinian guerrilla attacks and their families.
   The heart recipient, Hanna Khader, 54, of the Arab sector of
east Jerusalem, was in stable condition Friday at Hadassah Hospital
in Jerusalem.
   The donor, Sgt. Zeev Traum, 40, was buried Friday in Yodfat, a
collective farm, the army said.
   Traum, an army reservist, died Wednesday of a head wound
suffered when Arab guerrillas attacked his jeep with automatic
gunfire in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   His heart was flown by army helicopter from Soroka Hospital in
Beersheba to Hadassah Hospital, and the four-hour transplant was
immediately performed.
   It was the first known case since the start of the Palestinian
uprising of an Israeli donating an organ to a Palestinian.
   A group calling itself Victims of Arab Terror said the
transplant ``shows cooperation between people of culture and
gangs.''
   The transplant also was criticized by Yoel Israeli, whose
brother, Yehiel, died in December after the family of a Palestinian
shot to death by an Israeli soldier refused to donate the heart.
   ``Where were all the Arabs when we looked for heart? ... We came
with a humanitarian request and offered the family a large sum of
money. We were almost killed there. They refused ... for political
and nationalist reasons,'' he told the weekly Yerushalaim newspaper.
   Ultra-Orthodox Jewish rabbi Yeshayahu Scheinberg supported
Israeli, telling the daily Maariv that ``as long as the Arabs don't
donate to Jews, there is no need to donate to them, especially when
we talk of a fallen soldier who died glorifying God's name.''
   Traum was the 42nd Israeli killed in the 23-month-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the Gaza Strip and
West Bank. At least 615 Palestinians have died of Israeli gunfire
in the rebellion.
   Only one Arabic newspaper mentioned the operation, and
Palestinian reaction was mixed.
   Ali Jadeh, a Palestinian who spent 16 years in jail for security
offenses, said the story should have been published to show the
human side of Israelis.
   But he also said Israeli authorities were exploiting the issue.
``They are not making it public as an example for Arabs and Jews to
follow, but want to say that Israelis are human and Palestinians
are savage,'' he alleged.
   Controversy also erupted over publication of the names of those
involved in the transplant operation.
   The Khader family said they were concerned Palestinian
extremists would attack them for accepting the heart.
   ``Our policy is not to reveal the names of the donors,''
Haddassah Hospital spokeswoman Ruth Mekel said. ``We hope it won't
harm transplants in the future.''
   Chaim Reuveni, director of Soroka Hospital where Traum died,
said doctors had promised Traum's wife, Brenda, of Baltimore, that
her husband's identity would be kept secret. He said the hospital
would no longer participate in transplants until there was a law
guaranteeing donor anonymity.
   The director of the health ministry, Dr. Moshe Mashiah, told
Israel radio there is no legal means to prevent publication of the
name of a donor or recipient.
   ``I fear very much that as a result of what happened ... we will
have to look for a way to protect these wishes by law,'' Mashiah
said.

<TEXT>
   A dogged entrepreneur has produced a
high-tech solution for canine owners who feel guilty leaving their
pets at home alone _ a videotape to entertain housebound hounds.
   ``Doggie Adventure,'' a 25-minute video for the wet-nosed set,
is designed to stimulate Fido, not turn him into a couch canine.
Filmed from a pooch's perspective, the tape portrays a non-stop
romp through city streets, parks and a barnyard teeming with
animals. Its creator hopes that dogs will sniff, howl and slobber
along.
   The VCR still must be turned on by humans, or activated by a
timer.
   Writing and producing a video geared for dogs just seemed
natural to Harley Toberman, a Minneapolis businessman who says his
recently deceased dog, Miss Piggy, was responsible for the project.
The half-terrier, half-dachshund mongrel doesn't appear in the film
but her bark is featured on the soundtrack.
   ``She's just been such a part of my life,'' Toberman said in an
interview last week. ``I guess this tape we put together is
basically a biography of her.''
   Toberman, 44, said he is talking to some national retail outlets
to try to bring the $14.95 tape to stores by Christmas. Meanwhile,
it's available by mail order.
   Toberman, who runs a Twin Cities recording studio, said the idea
came to him after an outing with Miss Piggy to a friend's farm two
years ago. The cows sent the dog into a frenzy, and Toberman filmed
the scene with his portable camera.
   ``Every time she saw that tape, she'd start barking furiously,''
he said.
   Guilt also played a role in the videotape's creation.
   ``Many times, when we'd go out and do something and we'd tell
her she had to stay, she'd have a real sad look on her face,'' said
Toberman. ``It broke your heart.''
   Filmed on location in Minneapolis and Hinckley, Minn., _ during
the dog days of August, natch _ the tape cost about $15,000 to
produce.
   Stereophonic sound gives canine viewers an earful. A collar
jangles, grass crunches underfoot _ er, underpaw _ and water is
slurped up from a dish. The crunch of dog biscuits adds to the
ambiance.
   Toberman says a pet therapist recommended recording a variety of
sounds to keep the dog's attention. The therapist also suggested
that the pet owner turn the volume up louder than normal to give
the dog more of a sensation of being there.
   Technical problems were numerous, said Toberman, most notably a
scene that entailed taking the camera through pig slop.
   ``It was really grueling stuff, especially in August,'' he said.
   The video has been tested already on a few neighborhood dogs,
and according to Toberman, nearly all gave it a paws-up rating.
   ``These dogs would walk right up to the TV and put their nose
right up to the tube and just stare at it,'' he said. ``It was
uncanny.''
   Added his wife, Kim: ``They don't get to fall asleep. That's it.
They may be distracted for a moment, but they always come back.''
   Toberman realizes his video must appeal to human eyes as well,
so he made the tape in color. Dogs see only in black and white.
   A cat video hasn't been ruled out, but Toberman said it might be
less effective because cats have a shorter attention span.
   However, the entrepreneur is confident enough of ``Doggie
Adventure'' to be planning a longer sequel.

<HEAD>Frank Probe to Continue Over Congressional Recess</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House investigation into Rep. Barney Frank's
relationship with a male prostitute will continue over the year-end
congressional recess, an official involved in the probe said Friday.
   The House ethics committee has no meetings scheduled at present,
but committee staff will continue working on the Frank case, said
Mark Davis, a staff member.
   ``It's still open and ongoing,'' Davis said. ``The adjournment
of Congress has no impact on what the staff does or will be doing.''
   The ethics panel initially hoped to complete its investigation
of Frank, D-Mass., by the end of the year. Davis had no comment on
a report in The Washington Times that the investigation was being
extended while members await publication of a magazine article
about Frank.
   The newspaper reported Friday that members want to see what male
prostitute Stephen Gobie told Penthouse magazine in an interview
expected to be appear in the February issue.
   Penthouse spokeswoman Leslie Jay said the February issue is
slated to be published Jan. 2 but that no decision has been made on
whether the Frank article will appear in that issue.
   Frank spokesman Doug Cahn said, ``The question of timing of the
ethics committee is not a question for Barney Frank. Barney is
cooperating with the ethics committee.''
   Frank, who is homosexual, has admitted paying Gobie $80 for sex
in 1985 and subsequently hiring him with personal money to serve as
a housekeeper and driver from July 1985 through August 1987.
   Gobie made public the relationship in August, and claimed the
congressman knew he was running a prostitution ring from Frank's
Capitol Hill apartment. Gobie also accused Frank of engaging in sex
with him in the House gymnasium. Frank has denied the charges.
   The Times also reported that the Justice Department is
maintaining a file on the Frank case. A Justice Department
official, who requested anonymity, said, ``We are not yet
investigating any possible illegal activities on the part of Mr.
Frank.''

<HEAD>State Action To Enforce Cruise Missile Ban Impossible, Official Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maine's attorney general said Friday his
office knows of no way the state could legally force an end to
cruise missile test flights over the state, an action approved by
voters.
   The results of the non-binding referendum on Nov. 7 prompted
Gov. John R. McKernan to send letters to federal and congressional
officials, urging them to ``recognize this opposition and reassess
the need'' for test flights of the unarmed missiles over Maine.
   Maine is one of five states where Tomahawk missiles are flown by
the Navy. Missiles are launched from submarines off the coast and
fly at 500 to 6,000 feet above the ground to the Navy Survival
School at Rangeley.
   There have been three tests over Maine.
   State Attorney General James E. Tierney, releasing a letter to
McKernan, said that under the supremacy clause in Article VI of the
U.S. Constitution, ``the states are without constitutional power to
interfere with such actions.''
   But Tierney also said the state's inability to take legal action
against the federal government over the tests was undoubtedly in
the minds of advocates of the ban, because their resolution
specifically called on the governor to ``intervene with the federal
government to stop the testing.''
   Tierney said McKernan's letter-writing ``appears to be clearly
what was contemplated by the resolution, and satisfies your legal
obligation under it.''
   ``Consequently,'' Tierney said, ``the department urges you to
continue to pursue that course in the hope that, through such
forceful advocacy, the views of the citizens of Maine on the matter
may prevail.''
   Eric Johnson, campaign manager for proponents of the
anti-testing measure, did not respond immediately Friday to a
telephone request for comment on Tierney's letter.
   The deputy director of public affairs for the Navy project said
Friday there had been no change in status.
   ``Yes, we are going to continue to go with our plans as always
until we're ordered to do otherwise,'' Susan Boyd said in a
telephone interview from project headquarters outside Washington.
   Boyd would not comment on details of future tests, saying
planned flight dates are kept secret.
   In unofficial tallies of the Nov. 7 balloting, the issue was
approved by 52 percent of the voters. Opponents of the testing had
presented 66,142 valid signatures to force their advisory question
onto the ballot.

<HEAD>The President Pardons a Turkey</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush bestowed a ``presidential
pardon'' Friday on a noisy 50-pound turkey whose gobbles punctuated
a Rose Garden speech declaring next Thursday as Thanksgiving.
   ``Come on, this is serious stuff,'' Bush scolded the turkey.
   Unlike the bird that lunged at President Reagan several years
ago, this year's turkey quieted and bobbed his head calmly as Bush
left the podium to stroke its back.
   Bush was presented the 28-week-old turkey at a ceremony marking
the 200th anniversary of presidential Thanksgiving proclamations.
   Before signing this year's proclamation, Bush observed, ``two
hundred years ago, George Washington signed the original
proclamation for a day of Thanksgiving, a day of thanks for the
bounty we enjoy. ...''
   From that point, Bush continued haltingly as both the turkey's
gobbles and the crowd's laughter rose in volume.
   Bush told his audience, which included a group of 30 elementary
school children, ``our special guest ... seems understandably
nervous.''
   ``But let me assure you, and this fine tom turkey, that he will
not end up on anyone's dinner table, not this guy. He's granted a
presidential pardon as of right now.''
   Bush said the turkey would ``live out his days'' on a children's
petting zoo in the area.
   The turkey was raised in Detroit Lakes, Minn., by John
Wickliffe, the president of the National Turkey Federation, and his
wife, Eleanor.
   Wickliffe told Bush the turkey ``weighs 50 pounds, one for every
state in the union.''
   The federation said in a fact sheet that, this year's White
House turkey notwithstanding, Americans next Thursday will consume
45 million turkeys.
   The president said that the family dog, Millie, who loves to
chase squirrels and pigeons on the White House grounds, had been
dispatched ``upstairs, looking wistfully out of the window, I'm
sure.''
   Bush called two children from the audience _ third grader
Shannon Duffy, 8, and fifth grader Danny Benyam, 10, both from
Brenmar Park elementary school in Fairfax County, Va. _ to join him
in petting the turkey.
   At a similar ceremony several years ago, the turkey lunged at
and startled Reagan. The following year, the turkey was sedated.
   This year's turkey was not sedated but was presented ``live and
kicking,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   A bit later, addressing an arts ceremony, Bush said: ``I've been
out there trying to calm the national turkey. It all worked out
pretty well.''
   The tradition of presenting a live turkey to the president goes
back 42 years, to the administration of President Truman.

   A temporary-employment agency means business
when it hires and trains Santas by the sleighload every year.
   ``We take this very seriously,'' said Nancy Franklyn, manager of
the Pittsburgh branch of Western Temporary Services.
   A part-time Santa Claus must meet strict standards, she said.
   ``They must have twinkling eyes. They must know Christmas songs
and the names of all the reindeer,'' she said.
   ``They have to love wearing a 40-pound suit in a little room
that is not well ventilated, handling up to 200 children a day. ...
And they must be able to do this six hours straight and enjoy every
minute of it.''
   ``Don't `ho, ho, ho' around the children,'' she told the
surrogate Santas during a training session Thursday. ``It scares
the daylight out of them.''
   Although primarily an agency that provides temporary clerical
and medical support services, Western has been recruiting and
training Santas for retail stores and private parties across the
country since 1968.
   More than 3,000 Santas are recruited by Western offices across
the nation every year during the holiday season, she said. They
usually work 20 to 30 hours a week and earn $6 to $7 an hour, she
said.
   She passed on tips for handling awkward questions children
sometimes ask: Animals don't travel well in Santa's sleigh, so a
request for a pet is referred to parents. Requests for baby
brothers or sisters are referred to the stork.

   Mayor Jerry Hancock went to visit friends
in Orlando, Fla., and wound up being grand marshal of the city's
Queen Kumquat Sashay.
   Hancock said he was thrilled to ride in a pickup truck and throw
kumquats to parade watchers Saturday, despite being the festival's
second choice.
   According to the Orlando Sentinel, organizers had wanted Zsa Zsa
Gabor until her agent informed them of her $5,000 appearance fee.
   Hancock was suggested as an alternative by Mary Lee Mannix of
Orlando, who has distant ties to Mitchell and knew Hancock was
coming to visit some friends of hers.
   ``She asked me after I got there, and they already had it in the
paper,'' the 22-year mayor of the town of 4,600 said this week.
   One parade-watcher held a sign proclaiming ``I've been to
Mitchell,'' and someone else asked him how the limestone industry
was doing in southern Indiana.
   ``Saved 'em $5,000, I reckon,'' said Hancock, who performed his
ceremonial duties for free.

   Lizard love can be helped along by a few
months in the fridge, a zoo official says.
   Wichita's Sedgewick County Zoo and the Oklahoma City Zoo are two
of the few zoos in the nation that have successfully hatched Gila
monsters in captivity, said Eric Rundquist, a herpetologist
formerly with the Oklahoma zoo and now with the Wichita zoo.
   The trick is making the Gila monsters think they have
hibernated, he said, which is accomplished by putting the lizards
in a refrigerator. The zoo's six adult Gila monsters went in a
large commercial refrigerator in December and were taken out in
March. After hibernation, the warmer temperatures stimulated the
males' sperm production. The lizards bred in May.
   Two months later, the zoo's three females laid 13 eggs, about
half of which turned out to be fertile.
   The six baby Gilas hatched earlier this month go on display this
weekend.

   Senate leaders agreed Friday to send back to
President Bush the nomination of James Cason for a top natural
resources job and ask that someone else be selected.
   It was the first time since the vote against John Tower for
defense secretary earlier this year that a nomination got as far as
the Senate floor, only to be turned back.
   ``It will mark the first time that any assistant secretary
nominee would be defeated after being reported out of committee
with a favorable recommendation,'' said Republican leader Bob Dole
of Kansas.
   Cason, a high-ranking official at the Interior Department since
1982, was nominated to be assistant secretary of agriculture for
natural resources and soil conservation.
   After two days of hearings, the Agriculture Committee voted 12-7
to send the nomination to Senate floor, despite vocal opposition
from committee chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and some other
committee members.
   Cason was strongly opposed by environmentalists because they
said he showed a preference at Interior for private development
over environmental concerns.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., called Cason ``a James Watt clone,'' in
reference to the former interior secretary who favored development
of government land.
   Dole expressed disappointment at the mounting opposition, saying
a ``campaign of distortion has successfully poisoned the debate.''
   ``A cheap way to get a good environmental vote is to vote down
this nominee, whether he deserves it or not,'' said Dole. ``I can
see the handwriting on the wall.''
   After conferring with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and
the White House, Dole requested that the Senate not act on the
nomination.
   Leahy said Friday the nominee would have been defeated by a
20-vote margin, with opponents including more than five
Republicans, if a vote had been taken.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, agreed to send the
nomination back to Bush with ``a strong urging that this nominee
not be made the subject of a recess appointment or that he be
resubmitted'' when Congress comes back in January.
   ``I'm sure they're practical realists,'' said Leahy. ``I'm sure
they won't send the name back up here.''

<TEXT>
   Former South Korean Foreign Minister Choe Dok-shin,
who has lived in North Korea after becoming affiliated with a
dissident group that leans toward the Communist government, has
died at the age of 75.
   President Kim Il Sung visited Choe before he died Thursday night
in a hospital in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the Korean
Central News Agency reported Friday.
   Choe served as South Korean foreign minister in 1961-63
following a military coup led by Park Chung-hee, another army
general, on May 16, 1961.
   He headed the Chondoist Church, a Korean native religious group,
before seeking political asylum in the United States in 1977.
   After affiliating himself with a North Korean-leaning dissident
group Hanmintong _ the Korean Conference for Democracy and
Unification _ he went to North Korea in 1984. He has lived there
since 1986.
   In Pyongyang, Choe held such titles as chairman of the Central
Committee of the Chondoist Chong-wu Party, vice chairman of the
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland and
chairman of the Korean Religionists Council.
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.

   The House Armed Services Committee said Friday
it will hold hearings next month on the Navy's inquiry and
subsequent finding that a troubled sailor apparently caused the
fatal explosion aboard the USS Iowa.
   ``We have unearthed significant new evidence that casts new
light on the Navy's conclusion that gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig
committed suicide and mass murder in the gun turret,'' Rep.
Nicholas Mavroules, chairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on
investigations, said in a statement.
   Mavroules said his panel has been reviewing ``several aspects of
the Navy investigation _ especially its technical competence and
its psychological analysis.''
   Questioned later about his comments, Mavroules declined to
provide specifics, but expressed concern about a ``question of
interpretation'' of the evidence.
   The Massachusetts Democrat has said he ``seriously questioned''
the Navy's report, and cited an FBI report that said its laboratory
investigation on the incident was inconclusive.
   ``I want documentation,'' Mavroules said in an interview.
``Unless the Navy does that it's a discredit to the investigation.
The investigation was thorough but the conclusion was not
thorough.''
   Congressional sources, who requested anonymity, said the new
evidence centers on the FBI's psychological analysis of Hartwig and
the forensic evidence compiled by the FBI and the Navy.
   The House hearings, scheduled for Dec. 12 and 13, will include
witnesses from the Navy and FBI, Mavroules said.
   ``Let's get it all out on the table,'' he said.
   The House announcement of hearings came one day after the Senate
Amed Services Committee held the first in a series of hearings on
the Iowa incident.
   Navy officials on Thursday defended their conclusion that the
April 19 blast in gun turret No. 2 was ``most likely'' caused by
Hartwig, who had the responsibility of inserting the detonator into
one the battleship's 16-inch guns.
   Hartwig and 46 shipmates died in the explosion on the World War
II-era battleship.
   Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who oversaw the Navy's technical and
criminal investigation into the blast, testified Thursday that
additional technical tests conducted since he issued his report
Sept. 7 found ``unique foreign material'' on the projectile from
the exploding gun barrel that would not have been present during a
normal firing.
   The new tests identified the material as iron wires coated with
calcium, chlorine and oxygen, which would be produced by ``some
types of non-electronic explosive devices,'' Milligan said in his
statement.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said in a statement that the Navy's conclusion is based
on the premise that Hartwig had the skill and motivation to cause
the explosion and a technical explanation has been ruled out.
   ``If any one of those three legs fails to stand up, the entire
Navy conclusion collapses,'' Aspin said.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed Friday
for the ``trust of all our neighbors'' in dealings with beleaguered
East Germany.
   Speaking to the Bonn diplomatic corps on the eve of a European
Community summit of Western European leaders in Paris, Kohl also
called for help in making sure East German reforms do not collapse.
   Kohl said he realizes ``anxious questions are being put to the
Germans'' as East Germany heads into an uncertain future, among
them the question of prospects for German reunification.
   ``Our countrymen in the German Democratic Republic (East
Germany) must be able to state clearly which course they want to
take. Whatever their decision is, we will respect it,'' Kohl said.
   ``We need the trust of all our neighbors in East and West'' on
this question.
   He sought to allay any fears that prospects of ever-closer
relations with struggling East Germany could result in the rebirth
of German nationalism.
   ``This is not the birth of a new German nationalism, as some
suspect,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl said West Germany will be consulting with East German
leaders about what kinds of financial assistance Bonn might provide
to help support East Germany's sputtering economy.
   Helping the reform process in East Germany, Poland and Hungary,
``should be the concern for all Europeans,'' Kohl said.
   There has been concern among some West Europeans that events in
East Germany might sidetrack the European Community's moves to
strengthen itself by creating a single barrier-free market in late
1992.
   But Kohl pledged West Germany will ``continue its efforts, in
close cooperation with France and all other European partners, to
enhance European integration.''
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters, who attended the diplomatic
corps reception, said the United States would not be averse to
German reunification if that's what the East Germans choose. But he
stressed that others' view on the matter are also important to
consider, including the Soviet Union's.
   Walters said President Bush ``has said very clearly the United
States has no problem with this providing it can be done
peacefully, which means with some sort of consent from the Soviets,
and through the free choice of the people,'' Walters said.
   ``After all, they have 16 divisions stationed in eastern
Germany,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The State Department on Friday praised an
Organization of American States resolution calling for early
elections in Panama and condemning the ``serious violations'' of
human rights occurring there.
   The resolution was approved 25 to 2 shortly before midnight
Thursday by the OAS General Assembly. Only Panama and Nicaragua
voted in opposition.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
resolution ``repudiates and isolates'' the government of Panama's
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and is the strongest OAS statement to
date on that issue.
   At a separate news conference, the new U.S. ambassador to the
OAS, Luigi Einaudi, expressed regret that the resolution did not
mention Noriega by name but added that the isolation of the
Panamanian leader is ``now visible for everyone to see.''
   The Bush administration, which considers the Noriega-led
government to be illigitimate, was pleased that at no point in the
resolution was there any reference to the ``Panamanian government.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said the resolution ``deprives Noriega of any
pretext of legitimacy. We applaud the firm stand taken by the
Organization of American States, which can only serve to encourage
a return to democracy for the people of Panama, support for human
rights and an end to the brutal Noriega dictatorship.''

<HEAD>Burroughs Wellcome Seeks To Extend AZT To Those With AIDS Virus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burroughs Wellcome Co. is
seeking federal approval to market its anti-AIDS drug, AZT, to
people who have the AIDS virus but do not yet show signs of the
disease, the company said Friday.
   Permission for wider sales is being sought from the Food and
Drug Administration after clinical studies released in August
showed that AZT slows the onset of AIDs in people infected with the
virus, said company spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett.
   FDA approval for broader use would greatly expand demand for the
drug by extending it to several thousand HIV-infected people, she
said.
   AZT, the only FDA-approved drug for treatment of AIDS in the
United States, can be used now only on patients who show symptoms
of AIDS and those who are critically ill.
   Officials said there was no timetable for when the FDA might
approve the request.
   Meanwhile, Wellcome PLC, the British parent company of Burroughs
Wellcome in London, reported dramatic increases in sales of AZT,
also known as azidothymidne or Retrovir _ up 49 percent to $225
million.
   In September, North Carolina-based Burroughs Wellcome announced
a 20 percent price cut that effectively reduced the drug's retail
price from $8,000 per year per patient to $6,400.
   But Ms. Bartlett said there are no plans for another price cut
even if use of the drug is extended.
   AIDS activists have criticized Wellcome for reaping huge profits
from AZT, but the company has never disclosed financial results
from the drug.
   ``Our research work with this drug is by no means over, and it
will continue to absorb substantial (research and development)
resources,'' the company said in a statement Thursday.
   In the past year, Wellcome spent $317.5 million on research and
development. About 36 percent of the research-and-development
budget was spent on antiviral drugs such as AZT, up from 31 percent
in the previous year.
   Wellcome PLC reported Thursday it had posted sales of $2.4
billion in the year ended Aug. 26, up from $2.2 billion the
previous year. The company reported net income of $279.2 million,
or 33 cents per share, up from $223.7 million, or 27 cents per
share.
   Burroughs Wellcome accounted for about $1.5 billion, or 64
percent, of Wellcome's sales.
   Zovirax, an antiviral treatment for genital herpes, remains
Wellcome's leading seller at $492.2 million, up 36 percent.

<TEXT>
   A national English teachers' group on Friday
gave its ``Doublespeak Award'' to Exxon Corp. for calling some 35
miles of Alaskan beaches ``environmentally stable'' after an oil
spill cleanup earlier this year.
   William Lutz of Rutgers University told a convention of the
National Council of Teachers of English that the Committee on
Public Doublespeak selected Exxon the winner from among 18 nominees.
   Officials of the George Bush presidential campaign received
second place, Lutz said, for claiming ``that they disapproved of
the famous `Willie Horton' commercial while they did little to stop
it.''
   Third place went to former Interior Secretary James Watt, who
was paid a $300,000 ``consulting fee'' for making eight phone calls
to Samuel Pierce, then secretary of Housing and Urban Development,
and for one 30-minute meeting with Pierce, Lutz said.
   Lutz said the annual Doublespeak Award calls attention to
conspicuous examples of public language that in the committee's
view are ``deceptive, evasive, euphemistic, confusing, or
self-contradictory'' and have the potential for ``pernicious social
or political consequences.'' The committee bases its awards on news
reports.
   Lutz said Exxon claimed it had cleaned some 35 miles of Alaskan
beaches where the supertanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in late
March and then declared them ``environmentally clean'' and
``environmentally stabilized.''
   Lutz pointed to various news reports on the visible presence of
oil along the coast in the area. He said that after Exxon was
challenged by the news media, it ``no longer refers to the beaches
as being `cleaned,' but as being `treated.'''
   Exxon spokesman Bill Smith had this response: ``I think the
people who made this award should be aware that 12,000 men and
women worked throughout the summer in difficult and dangerous
conditions to treat and clean the beaches of Prince William Sound
and that the Coast Guard officer with responsibility for the
cleanup has said that no company or government could have done a
better job than Exxon.''
   The Bush campaign, Lutz said, used commercials that ``featured a
police photograph of a glowering Willie Horton, a black man who had
committed rape while on furlough from a Massachusetts prison.'' The
commercial was produced by the National Security Political Action
Committee. Bush campaign officials disavowed the ad.
   Lutz said other nominees for the doublespeak award included the
U.S. airline industry for insisting a United plane that crashed
near Sioux City, Iowa, experienced an ``uncontained engine
failure'' and the FBI for its ``Library Awareness Program,'' which
asks librarians to report suspicious-looking people who might be
Soviet spies.

   The Polish ambassador to Washington is
expected to leave by the end of the year to make room for someone
who ``better symbolizes the changes taking place in Poland,''
according to a senior Solidarity figure traveling with Lech Walesa.
   ``There are a number of names under consideration, but nothing
is settled yet,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``Because of our need for U.S. assistance, it is felt
that we need in Washington a figure who better symbolizes the
changes taking place in Poland.''
   The current ambassador, former deputy foreign minister Jan
Kinast, is a holdover from the Communist administration that was
replaced in Warsaw last August by the Solidarity-led government.
   Westerners in Warsaw also have picked up signals that Kinast may
be replaced by the end of the year, but say that the Solidarity
prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, ``plays cards very close to his
chest'' and has said publicly that there will be no purge of the
diplomatic corps.
   Walesa, during his visit this week to Washington, went out of
his way to reassure Kinast and other Communist Party members
working at the embassy that the Solidarity government has no plans
to withdraw him.
   But because of Kinast's association with the previous communist
government, he is likely to be replaced, said the Solidarity figure
who accompanied Walesa on his week-long visit to the United States.
   Polish embassy officials interviewed during the Walesa visit
said Communist Party members assigned to the embassy were bending
over backwards to faithfully represent the interests of the first
non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc.
   The embassy officials, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Solidarity had not assigned watchdogs to monitor the
activities of Poland's overseas embassies.
   They also noted that Mazowiecki had said repeatedly in public
that Communist Party officials employed in the diplomatic corps and
other branches of government would be given a chance to show
loyalty to the state and would not be purged simply because of
party membership.

<TEXT>
   East Germany was on the brink of a
crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Leipzig on Oct. 9, but it
was averted at the last minute, East German conductor Kurt Masur
said Friday.
   Masur, 62-year-old leader of the renowned Gewandhaus Orchestra,
said ``blood would have flowed'' that day if he and five others _ a
satirist, a churchman and three party officials _ had not banded
together and issued an appeal for peace at the last moment.
   Security forces and troops were massed in the streets and young
people ``were ready to die,'' Masur said at a news conference.
Civil war ``would have broken out,'' he said.
   Satirist Bernd-Lutz Lange added, ``But only one side would have
been armed. It would have been a military attack on the poeople.''
   Recalling that East German leader Egon Krenz issued statements
last summer backing the China's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in June, Masur said: ``We were on the brink of that.''
   Two days earlier, scores of demonstrators were beaten and
arrested when they marched peacefully in Leipzig on the 40th
birthday of East Germany.
   Hundreds more were arrested in East Berlin that weekend, while
300 others were jailed after battling riot police in Dresden Oct.
3-4.
   According to an article in Leipzig's newspaper on Friday and
Masur's own account, the conductor telephoned the Communist Party's
local cultural official Kurt Meyer around 2:30 p.m. Oct. 9 to
express his anxiety.
   Meyer got together Roland Woetzel _ now Leipzig's Communist
Party chief _ and another party official, Juergen Pommert, as well
as Lange and a churchman, Peter Zimmermann, and all met in Masur's
home.
   By 4:30 p.m., they had prepared a statement calling for calm and
promising dialogue, which was read out in all the churches where
peace prayers occurred and also broadcast on a Leipzig radio
station.
   The troops and security forces withdrew to side streets, and
Leipzig's demonstration passed off peacefully, a signal to East
Germans that they could start protesting without fear.
   Masur and the Communists were locked in sharp controversy Friday
over the role played by Krenz.
   At the news conference, Woetzel refused repeatedly to say
whether the troops that day had the order to shoot as Leipzig
opposition groups assert.
   He also tried to suggest that Krenz a decisive role by giving
orders from Berlin that all should proceed peacefully.
   ``Be honest here,'' interrupted Masur, threatening to walk out.
``I am not prepared to play the role of making Egon Krenz look as
if he was responsible'' for the lack of bloodshed, Masur added.
   Woetzel then admitted it was only in a later phone call _ after
the demonstration started _ that Krenz, who was then responsible
for security on the Politburo, had given instructions for all to be
peaceful.
   ``You sometimes find it hard to tell the truth,'' Masur
concluded.
   Leipzig's Communist newspaper Leipziger Volkszeitung on Friday
praised what it called ``the historic deed of the six,''
particularly lauding the three party men.
   ``They were aware that they had to act independently or bear
part of the guilt for the final burial of socialism on German soil
and for a catastrophe which would have endangered European
security,'' wrote Werner Bramke, a respected East German historian.

<HEAD>Federal Agencies Agree to New Wetlands Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal agencies agreed to curtail the
loss of wetlands through a unified policy on development, the
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency announced
Friday.
   The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers share federal
oversight responsibility for wetlands, but their rules have not
always jibed.
   ``We have had over the years some differences in policy
reflected in different definitions, in different approaches to
consideration of a proposal to develop a wetland or alter a wetland
resource,'' William Reilly told reporters.
   Reilly said previous policies ``have confused the public and
perhaps contributed to less than a stellar performance in wetlands
conservation.''
   He made the announcement after addressing an EPA conference
titled ``Environmental Challenges of the 90s.'' The agreement was
signed Wednesday.
   Under the agreement, wetlands development proposals will be
assessed first in terms of whether alternatives exist, Reilly said.
After that question has been resolved, the agreement calls for the
two agencies to address questions of compensation in carrying out
development in the least destructive ways.
   Reilly said the agreement grew out of President Bush's pledge
that there would be no net loss of wetlands under his
administration.
   ``The no net loss of wetlands policy does not result in the
shutdown of all wetlands development opportunities,'' Reilly said.
   Much wetlands decision-making is in the hands of state and local
governments. The principal federal power is the Corps, which grants
permits for putting fill in waterways and wetlands. The EPA has
certain veto powers over the process.
   Reilly is former president of the Conservation Foundation, which
sponsored a study group in November 1988 that made similar wetlands
recommendations.
   About 95 million acres of swamps, marshes and other wetlands
exist in the Lower 48 states, with more than 200 million acres of
tundra in Alaska, said Cliff Rader of the EPA's wetlands protection
office in Washington.
   Reilly said 300,000 to 500,000 acres of wetlands is lost each
year in the United States because of drainage, pollution and
development.
   Wetlands, once thought to be breeding grounds of disease, are
considered important to water purification and storage, habitat for
wildlife, including many endangered species, and in the
productivity of marine life, including commercially important
species.

   Senior administration officials disagreed in
congressional testimony Friday on whether to end the Energy
Department's practice of paying all environmental fines incurred by
companies that run its nuclear weapons plants.
   Critics of the practice say it weakens the companies' incentive
to comply with environmental protection rules, thereby undermining
efforts to clean up the weapons plants, which produce tons of
radioactive and hazardous wastes each year.
   The 17 major facilities that make the nation's nuclear weapons
are owned by the Energy Department but run by private corporations
under government contracts.
   In a related development, senior department officials briefed
representatives of six states on Energy Secretary James D. Watkins'
blueprint for opening the first permanent dump for radioactive
waste from the weapons plants.
   A department official who asked not to be identified said ``no
major decisions were made'' on plans for opening the Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M., by July 1990 at the
earliest. No firm date is expected to be set until next spring.
   The states represented in the meeting _ Washington, Idaho, New
Mexico, Colorado, Tennessee and South Carolina _ have rejected a
Watkins proposal that they temporarily store some of the weapons
waste until the New Mexico dump is opened. Existing storage
capacity in Colorado may be exceeded as early as next April, and
failure to find alternative storage sites could force a halt to
weapons production.
   Nevada also has rebuffed Watkins' urging to take some of the
waste, but was not represented at the meeting. The session did not
resolve the temporary storage problem, the official said, adding
that further talks with the state governors would be needed.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, said in a report released Friday that the Energy
Department recently paid $295,000 in penalties against two
unidentified weapons plant contractors for violations of laws
governing hazardous wastes _ plus $529,000 in related legal costs
of the companies.
   Stephen A. Wakefield, the department's general counsel, urged
defeat of a House bill to outlaw such indemnification of
contractors, but Christian B. Holmes, an acting assistant
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said it was
``completely appropriate'' to hold the contractors fully
accountable.
   ``If a contractor violates these laws, the contractor should be
held accountable in the same manner and to the same extent as an
operator of a private facility,'' Holmes told the House Energy
subcommittee on transporation and hazardous materials.
   Wakefield, however, said shielding the contractors from
financial liability is necessary because of the unusual risks they
assume in running the plants.
   ``While we want to aggressively demand greater management
accountability and fiscal responsibility from our contractors, we
also have to realize that there may not be many countervailing
incentives to keep the ... contractors from walking away
altogether,'' he said.
   Wakefield said the department was reviewing the issue and was
sending letters to members of Congress to seek advice on what, if
any, policy changes are needed.
   The GAO, in its report, said that in addition to picking up the
tab for the two recent fines imposed against contractors, the
Energy Department plans to pay all costs resulting from EPA and
state actions pending against four other contractors.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the main sponsor of the House bill that
would outlaw such payments, told the subcommittee, ``it's an
absolute outrage'' that taxpayers are footing the bill for the
environmental violations of private companies.
   ``Every time the EPA gets the contractors where it really hurts
_ in the wallet _ DOE soothes their pain by liberally applying
cash,'' Wyden said. ``It's no way to hold contractors accountable.''

<HEAD>Former Police Captain Names Officials as Part of Death Squad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   A former police captain said
high-ranking members of the national police were part of a death
squad that killed government opponents and staged terrorist attacks
in six countries, a newspaper reported Friday.
   Anti-apartheid figures said they were not suprised at the
allegations published by the Afrikaans-language Free Weekly
newspaper, since there have been dozens of unsolved killings of
activists and bombings of anti-government organizations in the past
10 years.
   Dirk Johannes Coetzee, who left the police force in 1986, was
quoted as telling the Free Weekly, ``I was the commander of the
assassination squad of the South African Police. My men and I
killed and eliminated political enemies of the government.''
   Coetzee said five death squad units were formed in 1980, all
based at a farm near Pretoria, where the government acknowledged
that former guerrillas were housed and made part of an anti-terror
unit.
   Coetzee said he left the squad in 1982 and that its activities
continued after he left the police force.
   The interview was conducted in Mauritius, where Coetzee said he
fled a week ago after being named by a former black security
policeman, Butana Nofomela, as being part of the death squad.
   Nofomela was spared from death row after giving information
about the operation and the long-unsolved killings of political
activists.
   Coetzee corroborated Nofomela's story that a police unit killed
black anti-apartheid lawyer Griffiths Mxenge in Durban in 1982,
poisoning his guard dogs, mutilating his body and trying to make it
look like a robbery.
   The newspaper also quoted Coetzee as saying:
   _ Security police smuggled explosives into Britain that were
used to blow up the African National Congress offices there in 1982.
   _ The death squad was responsible for the 1982 assassination of
Ruth First, wife of South African Communist Party leader Joe Slovo
and the highest ranking white member of the ANC.
   _ Several prisoners were poisoned with a special concoction
developed by a police general.
   _ Prisoners were shot or stabbed to death, then their bodies
were burned and the ashes scattered into rivers.
   _ Bombs were set in public places, and in one case, killed a
child.
   He said actions were carried out in Lesotho, Botswana,
Swaziland, Mozambique, Britain and South Africa.
   Maj. Gen. Herman Stadler, head of the police public relations
division, said, ``It seems strange that Capt. Coetzee, who several
years ago was suspended from the South African police, now makes
these untested and wild allegations from a foreign country where he
cannot be questioned to verify his claims.''
   Stadler said the allegations would be investigated.
   While Stadler said Coetzee was suspended, the newspaper said
Coetzee left under a medical discharge and that it had seen the
discharge papers.
   ``I know all the secrets of this unit, which is above the law,''
Coetzee was quoted as saying. ``I myself am guilty or at least an
accomplice to several murders.''
   Regarding the murder of Ms. First, Coetzee said his union broke
into a U.N. office in Swaziland, stole an envelope with an official
seal on it, and used it to mail a letter bomb that killed Ms. First
in Maputo, Mozambique.
   He identified more than a dozen other officers, including the
former head of the security police, a current police general,
brigadiers, and others who have since been promoted to high ranks
in the police force, as having knowledge of or participating in the
death squad activities.
   The South African Council of Churches, whose headquarters was
blown up in a case that remains unsolved, said in a statement that
Coetzee's story ``comes as no surprise to us. We have repeatedly
called for the police to include themselves in whatever
investigations they may conduct on the attacks of anti-apartheid
people and their property.''
   The anti-apartheid Democratic Party called for a judicial
commission, recommended that all the officers named by Coetzee be
suspended from duty, and said the charges ``undermine completely
the credibility of the police.''
   The African National Congress office in London said Coetzee's
report of the 1982 bombing there ``requires immediate action by the
British government.'' It called for the South African Embassy to be
closed.
   The British Foreign Office said it would await the results of a
South African investigation.

   A Vietnamese refugee who won $6 million in
an Ohio Lottery game didn't show up for work Friday. The company
official who hired him says he understands and wishes him well.
   William Snyder, personnel director at HFI Inc., said he hasn't
been able to talk to Anhtinh Ton Giang, 23, since employees learned
Thursday that Giang had the winning ticket in Wednesday night's
Super Lotto drawing.
   Giang told The Columbus Dispatch he wanted to quit his
$5.75-an-hour sewing job at the company, which makes interior trim
for automobiles.
   ``I don't blame him at all,'' said Synder. ``I tried to
congratulate him last night and couldn't reach him.''
   Snyder, who hired Giang two months ago, said he was a good
worker. ``He was very polite ... and a very nice person to be
around. I'm very happy for him.''
   Giang will receive $240,000 a year, after taxes, for 20 years.
   In an interview Thursday night, Giang told the newspaper that
although he planned to quit his job at HFI, he wants to find
another job, perhaps by going into a partnership with friends to
remodel and sell old houses. He previously worked in construction.
   ``I'm not (the kind of) person to get a lot of money and sit
around. Even if I have money, I won't be a lazy guy,'' he said.
``I'd like to do work that would improve myself. ... A few years
ago, when I came here, I was very poor, but I always worked hard.''
   Giang could not be reached Friday. Calls to his home telephone
number were not answered.
   He was the only person to have the six winning numbers: 5, 7, 9,
21, 33 and 39. The jackpot starts at $3 million and increases by at
least $3 million each time there is no winner. The drawing is held
twice a week.
   Giang said he wasn't sure how he would spend the money, except
to pay his brother Cam's way through college. Cam is a freshman at
Ohio State University.
   Giang told the newspaper he fled Vietnam because his family was
persecuted.
   ``My family was involved with the former government and with
Americans. It was very tough,'' he said.
   He spent 18 months in a refugee camp in Indonesia, then came to
the United States. A resettlement agency sent him to Columbus five
years ago.
   Giang also has an uncle and a cousin in the United States. He
said the rest of his family is still in Vietnam.

<HEAD>FDA Chief Says Agency Needs More Power to Punish Cheating on Drug
Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration chief told
Congress on Friday the agency needs more authority to punish
generic drug companies that cheat on safety tests and misrepresent
data to win product approvals.
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young also gave a qualified endorsement
to generic drugs, saying the agency's investigation of the 30
top-selling generics provides ``good assurances'' about their
overall safety.
   ``Are the generic drugs on the market safe and effective? The
answer appears to be a qualified yes ... our job is not done
though, and we will keep that qualification until we are done,''
Young told a House subcommittee.
   He added: ``Patients using generic drugs should continue using
them.''
   Young, testifying before the Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee, said he will work with lawmakers to beef up FDA's
ability to remove problem generics from the market quicker and to
take stronger action against the companies that violate FDA rules.
   He noted that problems have been found with certain
manufacturers, including several that switched their products for
brand-name drugs in tests required to win FDA approval.
   So far, he said, none of these cases, nor instances of company
executives attempting to bribe FDA employees, have compromised the
safety of any generic drugs that were sold to the public.
   As a result of the FDA's investigation, generic drug companies
have recalled a total of 83 drugs because of problems ranging from
manufacturing deficiencies to cheating on safety tests.
   In addition, the FDA has started the lengthy process of
withdrawing drug approvals for five generic drug makers.
   The FDA began investigating after the subcommittee turned up
evidence of fraud. So far three former FDA employees have been
convicted of receiving illegal gratuities and three generic drug
manufacturing executives have been convicted on bribery charges.
The investigations by FDA, the subcommittee and the U.S. attorney's
office are continuing and more charges are expected.
   The FDA does not have broad authority to recall drugs. In most
cases, the agency relies on companies to comply with FDA requests
for recalls.
   Several subcommittee members brought up the possibility of
giving FDA authority to bar future drug approvals from companies
that are shown to have committed criminal acts to win previous
approvals.
   Asked if he felt FDA needed that authority, Young said, ``I
absolutely do.''
   Young is leaving after more than five years as head of the FDA
next month to take another position within the Public Health
Service, which is part of the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   In an interview during a break in the hearing, Young denied
speculation that he is being forced out because of the generic drug
scandal.
   ``If I left last March, they would say it was because of the
Chilean grapes,'' imports of which were halted temporarily after a
poisoning threat, he said. ``If I leave now, it's the generic drugs.
   ``There's always some problem at FDA,'' he said, adding that
``there's no way to dismount from the tiger'' without stirring
speculation.
   At the hearing, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., subcommittee
chairman, praised Young's efforts to clean house at the FDA, and
warned the generic drug industry that, although Young is leaving,
the subcommittee will continue its investigation and ``will make
sure that a flood light is in place.''
   An interim report on the FDA's investigation into generic drugs
submitted to the subcommittee said that among 11 generic drug firms
suspected of wrongdoing, inspections found problems at nine of the
companies, including fraudulent drug approval applications,
``cutting corners'' in the manufacturing process and other
manufacturing deficiencies.
   The FDA wants to withdraw drug approvals for four of those
companies _ Bolar Pharmaceuticals of Copiague, N.Y.; Par
Pharmaceuticals of Spring Valley, N.Y.; Superpharm Corp. of Central
Islip, N.Y.; and Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of Springfield Gardens,
N.Y.
   Among 20 other companies inspected later, one firm, Quantum
Pharmics of Amityville, N.Y., was found to have falsified records
for a number of its products and manufacturing deficiencies were
found at other companies. The FDA wants to withdraw drug approvals
for 11 Quantum products.
   Tests on more than 2,500 samples of the 30 top-selling generic
drugs are nearly complete and so far have found that nearly 99
percent of the drugs sampled comply with FDA standards.
   Young said this is consistent with the rates routinely found for
brand-name and generic drugs.

<HEAD>Women Using Their Political, Social Connections to Save Elephants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two women returned from a trip to Africa with a
new avenue for their social and political connections _ saving
elephants from slaughter.
   Trisha Moseley and Susanna Colloredo founded International Tusk
Force, a fledgling group devoted to banning international ivory
trade.
   Their goal is to make the buying and wearing of ivory as
politically unfashionable as eating California grapes during the
United Farmworkers boycott of the 1960s and 1970s.
   ``One of the members of the Tusk Force saw an ivory product in
the catalog of a major department store,'' Moseley said. ``She was
so mad she cut up her credit card and sent it back to them.''
   The group, formed in May, puts out a monthly newsletter, with a
mailing list of about 300 names.
   African elephants are threatened by poachers who kill the older
ones for their tusks, which often are shipped to the Far East for
processing into ivory products. Since June, the United States,
Japan, the 12-nation European Economic Community, Switzerland and
Canada have banned ivory imports.
   But Moseley contends plenty of ivory products are still found in
stores, creating a continuous demand and fueling poaching.
   ``The general message is: Don't buy ivory and don't deal with
stores that do,'' Moseley said.
   As the wife of former state Rep. James Moseley, she knew how to
get the attention of politicians. Colloredo also had clout as the
wife of Ferdinand Colloredo, who is the former head of a large
Boston real estate firm and president of the influential Boston
business organization known as ``The Vault.''
   The two women used their connections to organize a Boston panel
discussion Thursday on banning the ivory trade, featuring
paleontolgist Richard Leakey. They also organized fund-raisers,
complete with appearances by tame elephants, that raised about
$30,000.
   The money was sent to Operation Meru, a Kenyan conservation
project, Moseley said.
   The women and their families went on safari in Africa and
learned from their guides of diminished elephant herds due to
poaching.
   Moseley has been involved with various conservation causes over
the years, but the plight of the elephant seemed to her
particularly symbolic of concerns over endangered wildlife.
   ``If we can't save the elephant, how can we save the rest?'' she
said.
   ``A lot of people's reaction is, `Why worry about elephants when
people are starving?' This is a good question for people to ask,''
Moseley said. ``The elephant can help the people if properly
managed.''

<HEAD>Justice May Block Release of Information in Fernandez-CIA Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Friday
he wasn't concerned that the Justice Department would be trying to
protect widely known information if it blocked the release of
classified evidence at an upcoming Iran-Contra trial.
   The attorney general made the comment when asked about
widespread speculation that the Justice Department is preparing to
block the release of classified information in the case of former
CIA agent Joseph Fernandez.
   Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
have indicated the Justice Department is poised to take that step.
   Such a move could result in dismissal of charges that Fernandez
lied about his covert involvement in shipping arms to the
Nicaraguan Contras when he was CIA station chief in San Jose, Costa
Rica.
   Without saying what the government planned to do, Thornburgh
said: ``Our responsibility under the congressional directions
contained in the Classified Information Procedures Act is to
reconcile the need to go forward with a particular criminal case
with the protection of vital national security information.''
   ``That's a responsiblity we take seriously and any action that
is taken under that act is designed to balance those needs and
carry out our responsibility.''
   ``If we do so, I'm not concerned,'' Thornburgh said when asked
whether he was concerned that if the department took such action in
the Fernandez case it would be blocking the use of information
about CIA operations in Central America that is already widely
known to the public.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, whose office is
prosecuting Fernandez, has contended that the Bush administration
would be maintaining a diplomatic fiction by refusing to allow the
disclosure of CIA stations in Honduras and El Salvador.
   The judge in the Fernandez case has ruled that the former CIA
agent is entitled to disclose the specific locations in his defense
as well as the existence of several CIA programs.
   Walsh has conceded the government's desire to protect the CIA
programs, saying he could narrow the charges against Fernandez if
that information were suppressed.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton has already rejected
proposed substitutions for the information and it is not known if
he would consent to narrowing the charges if that issue were
presented to him.
   Thornburgh also dismissed suggestions that the Bush
administration would be merely trying to prevent the disclosure of
politically embarrassing information.
   ``It is national security information,'' he said. ``We aren't in
the political business. We are charged by Congress with protecting
national security information that if disclosed would prejudice our
national security.
   He called it ``a responsibility which we won't hesitate to carry
out in a proper case.''
   But Walsh has accused Thornburgh of trying to duck that
responsiblity, delaying the start of the trial since July with
appeals of Hilton's secrecy rulings and his refusal to let the
Justice Department intervene directly in the case.
   At one point, the independent counsel accused Thornburgh of
using ``unannounced procedural maneuvers designed only to tie this
case in a knot of endless litigation.''
   Earlier this week, the Justice Department said it won't press
any further appeals of a 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal ruling
that it cannot intervene in the Fernandez case. That leaves the
Justice Department with the option of filing an affidavit to block
release of secrets.

<HEAD>Romanian Leader Defies Change in Soviet Bloc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu appears
to have set the tone for next week's meeting of his Communist
Party, blasting what he called reactionaries who want reform.
   There were also reports that the government, bucking a tide of
political and economic reform in the Soviet bloc, was taking
measures to prevent any upheaval during the five-day party congress
that begins Monday in Bucharest.
   The maverick Ceausescu was the only Warsaw Pact leader to defy
the Soviets in the 1960s and 1970s by not permitting joint military
exercises in his country and by not participating in the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Such independence in foreign policy decisions earned him
admiration in the West, while drawing attention away from
repression at home, coupled with a personality cult around the
``Conducator,'' _ or ``Leader,'' as Ceausescu is called _ that has
become unique in Europe.
   Now, with democratization reshaping most of the Soviet bloc, it
is Ceausescu's steadfast refusal to introduce political and
economic freedoms that increasingly have isolated him within the
Warsaw Pact.
   Even hard-line leaders in Czechoslovakia have paid at least
lip-service to the need to introduce some market forces and
plurality of opinion to economies and societies directed from the
top.
   But the Romanian Communist Party _ totally controlled by its
iron-willed leader _ considers any reform of the Stalinist model
treasonous.
   Romanian diplomats in Vienna said Ceausescu was expected to
endorse continuation of the status quo Monday in a keynote speech
at the opening of the congress.
   The Thursday issue of the party daily Scinteia quoted the
71-year old Ceausescu, whose 24 years at the helm of Romania make
him the longest-serving Soviet bloc leader, in comments that
presaged the tenor of the congress.
   In a blanket condemnation of reforms as violating ``the basic
principles of socialism,'' Ceausescu also accused ``reactionary
circles'' of exploiting confusion in the communist camp.
   A Scientia banner headline proclaimed the aim of the congress:
``The Re-election of The Most Beloved Son of Our Nation, Comrade
Nicolae Ceausescu, as Party Leader, a Historic Option of the Entire
Party and People.''
   Ceausescu's grip on the party means he does not have to fear the
kind of overt grassroots discontent that led to the recent ouster
of his hard-line East German and Bulgarian counterparts and their
replacement with reform-minded leaders.
   Recent meetings in 40 counties named Ceausescu proteges as
delegates to the congress and nominated his wife, two sons and
three brothers for election or re-election to some of the top party
posts.
   But there are signs of fear that opposition could come from
another quarter _ the military, which is said to be restive after
years of forced duty in the fields, mines and other civilian areas
producing for export or for the shortage-plagued domestic sector.
   A Romanian emigre in West Germany said Thursday a dissident
source in Bucharest told him of rumors that senior officers had
been sent on leave for the duration of the congress, apparently out
of fears of a possible coup attempt.
   There were unconfirmed reports in 1983 that a group of generals
had tried to topple Ceausescu. The reports were strengthened a few
months later by a rash of promotions to generals' ranks.
   Romania, which owed foreign banks and governments $11 billion in
1981, declared itself debt-free last spring after an accelerated
program of producing for export that left store shelves bare,
apartments cold, and private cars idled because of gasoline
rationing.
   Shortages persist, however, as Romania continues to export much
of what it grows or makes, in an attempt to shore up its
convertable currency supplies. Rationing of energy was announced
early this month for the sixth winter in a row, while staples such
as meat, butter, white flour, cooking oil and eggs are rationed all
year.
   In a rare move, probably provoked by growing restiveness because
of the catastrophic food shortages, Ceausescu last month toured
poorly stocked markets in Bucharest and promised better supplies.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also reported
unusally strict security measures in Bucharest.
   In the past week, roadblocks were erected on all main roads
leading to Bucharest, with armed officers checking identification,
he said.
   The main railway station and Otopeni Airport were being
patrolled by police squads, while the area near the 5,000-seat
Palace Hall _ site of the congress _ was declared off limits to all
but residents, who had to show identification.
   On the agenda of the congress is approval of a five-year
economic plan, as well as the election of the Central Committee,
the Politburo and the party leader.

<HEAD>East Berliners Begin a Second Weekend Exploring the West</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with East Germans arriving, color, details.
No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of East Germans snacked
in the streets and gazed into the windows of electronics stores
Friday night as they began a second weekend celebrating
theirnew-found freedom in West Berlin.
   Although the city was busier than usual as the visitors from the
East began pouring in, there was little of the tumultuous street
party atmosphere that engulfed the western sector a week ago.
   City officials said 500,000 East Germans had arrived in West
Berlin by Friday night.
   ``We'd like to stay all night and make a party,'' said
18-year-old East Berliner Ellen Eversberg. ``But already we can see
a party here costs a lot of money.''
   Ms. Eversberg and two friends were picking up free maps set out
in the lobby of a bank. They planned to go home after a look around
and return in the morning to line up at banks for their 100 marks
($54) in welcome money.
   For the second straight weekend, West Berlin banks will open
Saturday and Sunday to dispense the welcome money.
   Electronics stores in the Kurfuerstsendamm, the main shopping
street, were closed like most other stores by evening, but they
attracted the biggest groups of window-shoppers.
   The aroma of grilled bratwurst drifted across the sidewalks from
steet stalls.
   On the steps of the bomb-scarred Church of Remembrance, two men,
each clutching a can of beer, chanted ``East Berlin _ there is no
wall!''
   Outside the offices of Berliner Morgenpost, the main daily
newspaper, staffers dispensed free coffee to lines of East
Berliners.
   ``We'd like East Germans to get to know us,'' one said as the
new arrivals started curiously at the displays of Friday's edition.
   At Checkpoint Charlie on the Berlin Wall, a steady trickle of
Trabbi cars and pedestrians moved through.
   At a U.S. Army base at Mariendorf in the west of the city,
American troops set up a soup kitchen, at the requst of the West
German authorities, to feed 1,400 East German families who want to
stay permanently.
   The families were being sent to government reception centers for
the night.
   As West Berliners girded for the influx, there were signs that
the welcome mat might be wearing a bit thin.
   ``Of course, it's a wonderful thing they are free to come
here,'' said Gertie Starke, manager of an upmarket clothing store,
Heinemann, on the Kurfuerstendamm.
   ``But commercially it's a disaster. Our customers are simply not
prepared to come into town with these sort of crowds. They've been
driven out, and if this keeps up we can forget Christmas.''
   Last week, immmediately after East Germany's abrupt decision
Nov. 9 to let its citizens travel freely, 1.3 million East Germans
poured in and West Berlin, already crowded home to 2 million,
turned into a giant street party.
   This weekend, it could be even better _ or worse depending on
one's perspective.
   Heinemann, where a cashmere jacket costs about $680, has the
sort of customers who don't need to go where shopping means
fighting for space on the sidewalk.
   And it has absolutely nothing for customers whose spending power
consists of the once-a-year welcome money from the West German
government.
   But others were adapting. Street stalls selling nail polish,
trinkets, oranges and bananas proliferated.
   Electronic goods stores spent the week organizing stock of cheap
items they don't stock normally, such as no-frills portable stereos
at $25.
   And there were are the Levi jeans posters for those who can't
afford to go home with the real thing _ the ultimate badge of
Western consumerism.
   Ron Marcus, who runs a large jeans store, stocked up with
several thousand Levi posters. He said he was opening an additional
section on Saturday selling T-shirts and, for East Germans only,
half-price jeans at $35.
   ``They just freaked out over the jeans last weekend,'' said
Marcus. ``But most of them haven't got money for anything, so we
thought of the posters as something we could do.''
   Fast-food chains, which are within the range of East German
pockets, were laying in for a seige.
   McDonald's manager Martin Meissner ran job ads for part-time
helpers through the week, but got a poor response,. He said he was
offering double time to keep the regular staff on 12 and 24 hours
shifts.
   ``The East Germans have turned our worst month of the year into
the best,'' said Meissner.
   Hurbert Plura, who has a pretzel stall on the sidewalk, was also
prepared. Last weekend, Plura was home an hour after he set up the
stall _ the time it took to sell his day's supply of 500 pretzels.
He's ordered 4,000 for this weekend.

to sell the quasi-private agency established to manage and sell
loans and real estate from failed savings institutions.
   Almost since its creation in 1985, FADA has been the target of
harsh criticism from members of Congress who charged that the
federally owned, but privately controlled, financial institution
had grown into a bloated, inefficient bureaucracy mired in
political favoritism and inside dealing.
   Legislation enacted Aug. 9 ordered a new agency, the Resolution
Trust Corp., to sell FADA if it could, or dissolve it if it
couldn't.
   The $3 billion portfolio of loans and real estate managed by
FADA will revert to the government.
   The RTC was offering to sell FADA's offices in Washington, Los
Angeles, Atlanta, Denver and Dallas, and its computer system and
office furnishings. However, regulators were unwilling to sell the
agency's name, charter as a financial institution, cash or rights
to asset management contracts.
   Steven Seelig, RTC director of FADA oversight, said the three
bids received for FADA all had conditions attached that made them
unacceptable. One bidder, for instance, wanted to retain asset
management contracts but also have the right to buy the assets, a
violation of the RTC conflict of interest policy, he said.
   The three bidders were J.E. Robert Companies, an Alexandria,
Va., real estate management firm; NCNB Texas National Bank, Dallas,
and Real Estate Advisory Services Corp., Denver.
   FADA's 275 employees will be offered jobs with the RTC or with
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Seelig said a few highly paid
senior employees of FADA may opt to quit when the dissolution
becomes effective at the end of January rather than accept a job at
government pay.
   Previously, the FDIC announced it would try to sell $428 million
in FADA-managed properties in a block. The package includes 150
properties located in Texas, California, Colorado, Arizona and
Florida.

<TEXT>
   A British reporter was fatally shot Friday by a
sniper during street fighting between rebels and government troops
in El Salvador, his editor said.
   David Blundy was the Washington correspondent for the
London-based Sunday Correspondent newspaper and had recently come
to this capital to cover the renewed fighting for the paper. He was
44.
   A sniper's bullet struck Blundy in the Mejicanos district of San
Salvador as he and several other journalists were stopped by
soldiers from getting too close to the battleground, said editor
Peter Cole.
   ``A single shot came from a building opposite,'' Cole said.
``Everyone fell to the ground, there was a burst of gunfire and
after that, when the shooting stopped, the others got up but David
was still down.''
   Cole said Blundy's colleagues took him to Rosales Hospital where
doctors removed the bullet that had entered his shoulder and
pierced a lung. Cole said the journalist survived the operation but
died several hours later.
   The editor said Blundy had asked to be sent to El Salvador last
week to cover the heaviest guerrilla offensive in the decade-old
civil war.
   ``He was used to danger and a highly experienced reporter,''
Cole said.
   Blundy was New York correspondent for the Sunday Times from
1978-82, then chief foreign correspondent, mainly responsible for
the Middle East and Africa. He joined the Sunday Telegraph in July
1986 but left this year to join the 2-month-old Correspondent as
its Washington-based writer.
   ``He went into some very hot spots, like Beirut and Northern
Ireland,'' Sunday Telegraph editor Trevor Grove said.
   Don Berry, the assistant editor at the Daily Telegraph,
described Blundy as highly professional and very brave. He said
Blundy was interested in covering Central America and had been
studying Spanish.
   ``He was a lovely 6-foot, 5-inch, big man with not an enemy in
the world,'' Cole said. ``He was laconic, self-deprecating and
always good to be with, at the same time an extraordinary,
brilliant journalist.''
   Cole added Blundy had been preparing to go to the U.S.-Soviet
summit on ships off Malta in two weeks.
   Cole said Blundy, who was divorced, had two daughters, aged 18
and 2.

   The Foreign Ministry said Friday that U.S.
complaints about the delivery of MiG-29 warplanes to Cuba were an
attempt to worsen relations on the eve of the Bush-Gorbachev
summit, Tass reported.
   Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev are to meet Dec. 2-3
for a shipboard summit off the Mediterranean island of Malta.
   The State Department complained Wednesday that shipping MiGs to
Cuba was ``wholly inconsistent'' with Moscow's stated desire to
promote peace in Central America. Department spokesman Richard
Boucher would not say how many MiGs the Soviets were sending.
   Gennady Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said two
training MiGs had been delivered to Cuba as part of an agreement
signed several years ago. ``The U.S.S.R. is not undertaking
anything in Cuba which would violate'' a 1962 agreement with the
United States, the official news agency quoted him as saying.
   Gerasimov apparently meant the agreement that ended the Cuban
missile crisis, which prohibits the Soviets from giving Cuba
nuclear weapons capability. Some MiGs are capable of carring
nuclear weapons.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavily armed Tamil militants attacked
four police stations Friday in eastern Sri Lanka and 27 people were
killed, military officials said.
   The simultaneous attacks that began before dawn in the Ampara
district, 125 miles east of the capital Colombo, were launched by a
new Tamil militia called the Tamil National Army, said the
officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   Government officials say the illegal militia was formed as fears
of attacks by Tamil guerrilla groups increased with the ongoing
departure of Indian troops ahead of a Dec. 31 deadline.
   The troops were first sent more than two years ago as part of a
peace plan aimed at ending the insurgency. Members of the Tamil
minority claim discrimination by the Sinhalese majority, and Tamil
rebels are fighting for autonomy in the north and east.
   At least eight police and four soldiers were killed and 40 more
were wounded in the fighting at Kalmunai, Sammanturai, Akkaripattu
and Chavalakady, the officials said without elaborating. At least
24 militants were wounded, they said.
   The villages are in a radius of 15 miles from Ampara, the town
that bears the same name as the district.
   The attacks continued for nine hours, they said. Rockets,
machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades were used, they said.
   Three helicopter gunships strafed the area, providing cover to
troop reinforcements sent to the beseiged police stations, the
officials said.
   Residents in Ampara and Batticaloa, 30 miles further north, said
schools, shops and offices had closed and streets were deserted.
The residents, contacted by telephone, spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Tamil National Army is believed to have been set up by three
former rebel groups that control the Northeastern Provincial
Council, the local government.
   Officials said the militants killed at least four policemen and
wounded five more in scattered attacks in Ampara during the week.
   India deployed an estimated 47,000 soldiers under the terms of a
July 1987 peace accord that sought to end a Tamil rebellion for a
separate homeland by providing limited political autonomy to the
Tamil minority.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people and allege discrimination in jobs and education
by the Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist and make up 75
percent of the population and control the government and the
military.
   The Indian soldiers were initially deployed to supervise an arms
surrender but became involved in a guerrilla war when the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the dominant militant group,
reneged on the agreement.
   Days after all Indian soldiers withdrew from Ampara district
last month, Tamil Tigers raided two camps of the Tamil National
Army and at least 33 people were killed, prompting the government
to deploy 900 troops in the district.
   About 900 more soldiers were sent to Ampara this week after the
Tamil National Army attacked the camps of Eelam Revolutionary
Organization of Students, another rival group.
   More than 1,100 Indian soldiers have been killed since 1987, in
addition to the more than 10,000 Sri Lankans who have died in the
insurgency that started in 1983.
   India joined the peace effort on the island off its southern
coast because of its role as a regional power and the concerns of
the politically powerful 60 million Tamil minority in India.

<HEAD>Soviet Premier, Striking Coal Miners Have Heated Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a heated meeting Friday with Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov, striking coal miners said the government is not keeping
its promises to improve their working and living conditions, the
Tass news agency reported.
   It said that during the meeting in the Kremlin, the miners
demanded that officials responsible for the lack of progress be
punished.
   Tass said Ryzhkov told the miners each side must ``bear its
share of responsibility.'' It indicated the premier stopped short
of directly asking the 15,000 miners from the Soviet Arctic to
return to work.
   Miners began the walkout Oct. 25 at 12 of the 13 mines near
Vorkuta, 950 miles northeast of Moscow, to press the government to
fulfill promised increases in pensions and wage differentials for
hazardous working conditions and improvements in living conditions.
The government made the promises to end strikes that affected
virtually all the country's coalfields in July.
   In renewing their walkout, the Vorkuta miners added political
demands, including removing language in the Soviet Constitution
making the Communist Party the leading force of society. They also
demand that power be turned over to local governing councils, land
to farmers and factories to workers.
   They have defied earlier appeals by Ryzhkov, President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and other officials to return to work, even though the
strike is depleting fuel supplies as the country heads into winter.
   Tass reported Ryzhkov told the miners at the meeting held in a
``heated atmosphere'' that the strikes have caused a shortfall of
14 million tons of coal.
   He said pension increases for miners and longer vacations were
provided for in legislation now before the Soviet legislature,
according to Tass.
   It reported the miners' representatives said ``significant
changes in the (coal) sphere and the solution of social problems of
miners have not yet occurred.''
   ``More than once at the meeting demands were heard to punish
those who hinder or delay'' improvements, Tass said.
   Miners who attended the meeting could not be reached for
comment. Soviet authorities have refused to permit The Associated
Press to visit Vorkuta _ an area long closed to foreigners.
   On Tuesday, the miners lost an appeal of a court ruling that
their strike was illegal. The decision by the Supreme Court of the
Russian Federation, the republic where the miners are from, means
the strike organizers face firing from their jobs and fines of
$1,620 each.
   Soviet reports have said Vorkuta's electricity and heating
supplies are threatened because of a coal shortage and First Deputy
Premier Lev Voronin warned that rationing may be necessary.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Returns $4.6 Million in Seized Cash to Houston Police</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thorburgh returned
nearly $4.6 million in confiscated drug revenues to the Houston
Police Department on Friday, saying ``booty of the drug trade can
be turned into offensive weapons for law enforcement.''
   Thornburgh's decision personally to present a check for the $4.6
million to Assistant Police Chief Dennis Storemski ``sends a
signal'' that Houston is being recognized as one of the major
points for illegal drugs entering the country, said Rep. Jack
Fields, R-Texas.
   But Thornburgh declined to say whether the Justice Department
would recommend Houston and the Texas-Mexico border be declared a
high-intensity drug trafficking zone, which would make the region
eligible for increased federal help in attacking the narcotics
trade.
   The $4.6 million returned to Houston was seized in a joint
investigation earlier this year involving the Internal Revenue
Service and Houston police.
   A two-week, around-the-clock surveillance led to raids on two
``stash houses'' in which $4 million in cash was seized. Another
$1.69 million was taken from a vehicle. The federal government gets
to keep part of such seized cash, in this case slightly more than
$1 million.
   ``We're here to illustrate a new twist on an old maxim _ that
is, to illustrate the notion that crime does pay for effective law
enforcement,'' Thornburgh said.
   Storemski said the money would be used to pay informants and to
buy vehicles, surveillance equipment and other equipment.
   Since its creation in 1985, the Asset Forfeiture Fund has shared
more than $290 million with local and state agencies.

<TEXT>
   A U.S.-trained team of Salvadoran forensic
experts has begun an investigation of the slaying of six Jesuit
priests and two others in El Salvador, the State Department said
Friday.
   ``Regardless of who the perpetrators are, we want punishment for
those attempting to hinder the process of peace and democracy in El
Salvador,'' said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   She noted that Salvadoran President Alfredo Christiani had
assured U.S. Ambassador William Walker that even if members of the
Salvadoran armed forces were involved, ``they will feel the full
weight of the law.''
   ``The United States expects him to meet that commitment,'' said
Ms. Tutwiler.
   She said U.S. officials ``will certainly be forthcoming in our
help'' if asked by the Salvadoran government to assist directly in
the investigation.
   ``The special investigative unit ... is equipped and trained and
funded by the United States,'' Ms. Tutwiler told reporters. ``It is
conducting a forensic examination of this crime, and they have,
it's my understanding, already taken samples from the scene and
will conduct the autopsies.''
   She said the unit was formed about six years ago.
   ``When it has been deployed, it has been effective,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said, recalling that in one case its investigation had led
to the arrest of two army officers and seven soldiers, who are in
jail awaiting trial.
   She said she was unable to confirm or deny reports that
witnesses had said they had seen men in uniform enter the Jesuit
rectory before the slayings.
   She said there were no American advisers out in the field with
the investigative unit.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the State Department had heard reports that
threats were made against the Jesuits in a national radio call-in
program before the slayings.
   ``We condemn that call for violence as we condemn, in the
strongest possible terms, the tragic killings themselves,'' she
said.

   A judge ordered the British
Broadcasting Corp. on Friday to give police the television film of
a rally at which Moslems allegedly raised their hands in favor of
killing novelist Salman Rushdie.
   The BBC had refused the police request, but said it would comply
with the ruling by Judge Michael Sachs of the Manchester High Court.
   The film showed a rally in Manchester last month at which
Moslems were allegedly asked to vote on whether Rushdie should die
for the ``blasphemy'' against Islam contained in his novel ``The
Satanic Verses,'' and some raised their hands in favor.
   Manchester police asked prosecutors to consider criminal
proceedings and the prosecutors asked police to obtain transmitted
and untransmitted film of the rally.
   ``The judge viewed a section of the tape and ruled it was
relevant. He ordered it to be handed over and the BBC will comply
with that order,'' said a spokesman for the BBC's Manchester office.
   He would not say the material to be given to police had been
included in a report the BBC broadcast Oct. 21. The hearing before
the judge was closed.
   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said the standing policy
of all British broadcasters was to refuse to provide film to
authorities.
   ``If the BBC was to allow automatic access to untransmitted
material, our own staff could become victims in hostile actions,
and ... we have a duty to protect our staff and thereby safeguard
our ability to cover the news,'' he said.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since February, when the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran declared that he had committed
blasphemy in ``The Satanic Verses'' and ordered his followers to
kill the novelist.

<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve policymakers decided to keep
interest rates unchanged early this fall, but agreed to ease their
grip on credit if developments warranted, according to minutes of
their October meeting released Friday.
   In fact, the central bank surprised everyone on Nov. 7 when it
permitted a key interest rate, the federal funds rate, to drop from
8.75 percent to 8.5 percent.
   Manipulation of this rate, the interest banks charge each other
for overnight loans, is the primary lever the Fed uses to control
short-term interest rates.
   The initial decision to keep rates unchanged was reached on a
9-2 vote at an Oct. 3 meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee,
composed of Fed governors in Washington and five of the 12 Fed
regional bank presidents.
   The committee met again last Tuesday, but minutes of that
session will not be released until late December. The committee
gathers in secret eight times a year to formulate monetary policy
and confers by telephone as needed.
   The Washington Post reported Nov. 8 the latest decision to ease
rates was made during a telephone conference call Nov. 6 among
members of the Open Market Committee.
   The quarter-point drop was the fifth small decline that has
occurred since late May when the central bank began to reverse a
yearlong effort to drive interest rates higher as a way to fight
inflationary pressure.
   At its Oct. 3 meeting, the committee noted ``that underlying
inflationary pressures were likely to ease a little over the next
several quarters'' while ``economic activity continued to expand at
a moderate pace in the third quarter.''
   As a result, the minutes said, ``all but two of the members
indicated that they preferred or could accept a directive that
called for maintaining the current degree of pressure ... and that
provided for giving particular weight to potential developments
that might require some slight easing ...''
   The dissenting votes were cast by Roger Duffey, president of the
Kansas City regional Fed Bank, who preferred an unchanged policy
because of concern that inflation would continue to be too high,
and Fed Gov. Martha Seger, who favored immediate easing because of
the weakening economy.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new East German premier said Friday his
country is open to private enterprise and foreign investment to
meet the needs of frustrated consumers, but warned of hard economic
times ahead.
   In his first speech to the East German parliament as head of the
government, Hans Modrow recommended greater cooperation with
economically powerful West Germany while rejecting reunification.
   The official news agency ADN released a letter from President
Bush telling the new leadership the United States is interested in
closer relations.
   By Friday night, about 1.2 million East Germans had entered all
of West Germany, including West Berlin, presaging a second wild
weekend of shopping and sightseeing since East Germany opened its
borders Nov. 9.
   Although East Germany's economy inspires envy in the Soviet
bloc, Communist Party chief Egon Krenz and his new leadership have
made clear that debts and a dwindling labor force will prevent it
from catching the West anytime soon.
   More than 200,000 East Germans, nearly 1{ percent of the
population, have moved to West Germany the past several months.
Most are young, skilled workers vital to the country's industry.
   Modrow sketched a blueprint for economic recovery that mixes a
few free-market principles into the state plan for the nation of
16.5 million.
   He said talk of reunification was ``dangerous and unrealistic,''
and instead directed attention toward a course of reform similar to
that set for the Soviet Union by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev's model aims at social renewal through democratic
freedoms of speech, assembly and the press, and at allowing workers
to produce goods or provide services privately in their free time.
   East German economists have rejected the more market-oriented
reforms embraced by Poland and Hungary, whose economies are in far
worse condition.
   Predicting hard times ahead, Modrow said continued budget
deficits will be necessary and the government must bring prices
into line with production costs, which will be hard on the nation's
disproportionate number of pensioners.
   He blamed the current deficits on ``squandering of state money
and excessive administrative outlays.''
   Modrow also revealed his proposed Cabinet at the beginning of a
two-day session of Parliament. Eleven of the 28 places were given
to non-Communists, members of four small political groups allied
with the party.
   The 44-member cabinet forced out Nov. 7 had only four members
from the allied parties, which were formed to create a semblance of
open government and have become more independent since the
pro-democracy movement began.
   East Germany is ``open for proposals on joint ventures,
investment, transfer of profits and environmental pilot projects,''
Modrow said, all of which address concerns of Western business
leaders interested in the East German market.
   He said the government ``sees as its most urgent responsibility
the stabilization of the economy.''
   Talking with journalists after the session, Modroww urged East
Germans not to trade their non-convertible marks on the black
market in order to buy goods in West Germany. He conceded one West
German mark costs 20 East German on the black market, although the
official rate set by East Germany is 1-for-1.
   Relations with West Germany should be strengthened by agreements
dealing with security, cooperation, environmental protection and
other matters of common interest, Modrow said in his parliament
speech.
   ``By means of a new reality of life in the German Democratic
Republic (East Germany), the dangerous and unrealistic talk of a
reunification will be clearly rejected,'' he said to long applause.
   Bonn's reaction to agreements was wary. West Germany does not
recognize the nation's division and Volker Ruehe of the Christian
Democrats, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's political party, said signing
treaties could be tantamount to such recognition.
   Modrow and Krenz are fighting time to improve the economy and
stem the tide of emigration, and also face increasing demands for
free elections.
   Manfred Gerlach of the Liberal Democrats, one of the four
parties allied with the Communists, is a leading voice for free
elections.
   Gerlach, whose party has three ministries in Modrow's Cabinet,
told the 500-member parliament the Liberal Democrats no longer
would run their candidates in a bloc with the Communists and called
for ``true sharing of power'' in free choice by the voters.
   His proposal for free elections and new legislation on voting
and campaign procedures did not address the question of recognizing
New Forum and other pro-democracy groups that have agitated for a
role in government.
   Earlier this week, Gerlach said he would ask the parliament to
remove the constitutional provision of a ``leading role'' for the
Communist Party that guarantees its supremacy. He did not mention
it in his speech Friday, but the session still has a day to run.

   Eleven months after the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Scotland, the government and airlines still are
endangering lives with lax aviation security, relatives of the
flight victims told a presidential commission Friday.
   ``The confidence of the public has been badly shaken and will
not return until the truth is told and remedies are put into
place,'' said Paul Hudson, whose 16-year-old daughter was one of
270 people killed in the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing.
   The seven-member Presidential Commission on Aviation Security
and Terrorism held the first of several hearings into government
conduct before and after the destruction of the Boeing 747 airliner
by plastic explosives concealed in a radio-cassette player. British
investigators blame the bombing on terrorists whom they have not
identified.
   ``We won't let you down,'' Commission Chairwoman Ann McLaughlin
told relatives of Americans who died in the crash. The former labor
secretary said the commission would evaluate aviation security, the
handling of terrorist threats against air travel and whether the
public should be told of them, and the government's treatment of
terrorists' victims.
   ``We will let the chips fall where they may,'' Mrs. McLaughlin
said. The commission is to make recommendations to President Bush
in May. The panel, which has a $1 million budget for six months,
includes four members of Congress and two prominent military men.
   The panel also is considering the similar destruction of a
French UTA DC-10 over the African country of Niger on Sept. 19,
which killed 174 people, including seven Americans. The goal is to
find ways of protecting U.S. citizens who fly on foreign carriers.
   Alexander Alimanestianu of New York City, whose father, Mihai,
died aboard the Chad-Paris flight, compared aviation terrorists to
serial murderers. ``We know the next one is being plotted right now
_ another bomb, another plane; it's just a matter of time,'' he
said.
   In other testimony at the daylong hearing:
   _Richard Lally, vice president of the Air Transport Association,
which represents U.S. airlines, said the government should pay for
improved bomb-detection devices and asked for ratification of a
treaty that will give U.S. victims of air terrorism greater
compensation.
   _Christopher Witkowski of the Aviation Consumer Action Project
said aviation security is inadequate because it has been planned by
``a close-knit group of industry representatives and the FAA''
without passenger involvement.
   _Billie H. Vincent, former FAA security director, said aviation
security is ``seriously deficient'' in high-threat areas such as
Europe and the Middle East.
   _Peter Reiss of the Air Line Pilots Association said a thermal
neutron analysis device like the ones the FAA has ordered U.S.
airlines to install at airports throughout the world would not have
detected the Flight 103 bomb without disrupting airline schedules
with false alarms. He said the technology has to be improved before
it can be used widely.
   Relatives of the more than 180 Americans killed in the Pan Am
bombing have formed a nationwide group that had asked for a
full-scale congressional investigation.
   Mrs. McLaughlin said she had ties to three victims of Flight
103: a cousin, Bernie McLaughlin; J.D. Flynn, a son of a college
classmate, and Karen Noonan, a college student who worked in her
office when she was secretary of labor.
   Mrs. McLaughlin said this gave a personal dimension to her
interest in aviation security but said she had never joined the
relatives' organization. She said she was picked to head the
commission because of her government experience.
   ``The American government has broken faith with its citizens. It
has turned its back on its responsibility to protect the lives of
American citizens at home and abroad,'' said Bert Ammerman,
president of the group. He had a brother aboard Flight 103, which
had just left London en route from Frankfurt to New York City when
it blew up.
   Victoria Cummock of Coral Gables, Fla., held up the badly
damaged attache case of her husband, who died aboard the flight,
and said, ``Ladies and gentlemen, this is what remains of John
Cummock.''
   Mrs. Cummock said she wanted the commission to feel the effects
of the disaster on her ``all-American family'' so the bombing would
not be considered just an ``unfortunate isolated incident or an
inconvenience in a system that occasionally goes on the blink.''
   Members of the commission include Sens. Frank R. Lautenberg,
D-N.J., and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.; Reps. James Oberstar, D-Minn.,
and John Hammerschmidt, R-Ark.; former Assistant Navy Secretary
Edward Hidalgo and retired Air Force Gen. Thomas C. Richards.

<HEAD>`Puppy' Coming Home After Abduction, Life In Fast Lane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not since Toto has a dog had such a wild ride,
starting with Puppy's abduction, a cross-country ride in a stolen
pickup, a 140-mile chase and gunshots before police captured the
dognapper who bought doggie treats.
   Whether Wayne and Jamie DeRosier's 12-year-old collie-shepherd
remembers the episode or not, her abduction is not one the couple
will soon forget.
   At first they weren't concerned when Puppy went missing on
Halloween. Absences of several hours weren't that unusual.
   Then their neighbor told them a strange man had led the dog away
with a rope around her neck.
   After a couple of days, the DeRosiers began making daily phone
calls and searches at the animal shelter.
   On Tuesday night they got a call from the local Humane Society
saying Puppy was fine, and could the DeRosiers make arrangements
for her return from Junction City, Kan.?
   ``The lady calling started out by saying, `This is a kind of
weird story,''' Jamie DeRosier said. ``No kidding.''
   After her abduction in Seattle, Puppy's escapade took her to
Oregon, where her 37-year-old captor stole a 4-wheel-drive pickup
truck Nov. 4 in Eugene.
   After driving through Denver, the man and dog were resting about
7 p.m. Tuesday along the side of Interstate 70 near Salina, Kan.
   A highway patrolman who noticed the truck made a computer check
on the Oregon license plates, found out it was stolen and the chase
was on.
   The abductor, with Puppy at his side, led a growing number of
patrol cars through five Kansas counties. Eventually some 20 cars
were in pursuit.
   Geary County Sheriff Bill Deppish said police at first tried to
wait for the truck to run out of gas. But 2{ hours and 140 miles
later, officers began shooting out tires on the pickup. Still the
truck lumbered on.
   Finally police rammed the pickup off the highway, damaging four
patrol cars in the process, said Marsha Shane, Geary County
sheriff's dispatcher.
   ``You can classify this as a record chase,'' Deppish said, ``and
it scared that poor dog. I don't think she had been shot at before.
She seemed awfully happy to see us, though her tail wasn't wagging
at first.''
   Timothy O'Dell, a commercial fisherman from Seattle, was
arrested and held on charges of possession of a stolen vehicle, two
counts of aggravated battery on law enforcement officer, reckless
driving, criminal damage to property and attempting to flee and
elude.
   Police had no explanation why O'Dell took the dog, but they said
dog food and dog treats were found in the truck. Puppy ``had been
well taken care of,'' Deppish said.
   She was taken to Kansas City, Mo., and put on a plane to Seattle
on Friday.
   ``He seemed to be feeding her anyway, and she likes just about
anybody,'' Jamie DeRosier said several hours before her dog's
expected return Friday. ``I think she'll be really glad to see us,
and we're going to be glad to see her.''

<HEAD>Lithuanian Communists Meet, Argue with Kremlin Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuanian Communist Party leaders who seek a
multiparty system and some independence said Friday that President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev appeared angry during a 7{-hour meeting to
which the Politburo summoned them.
   But Algirdas Brazauskas, first secretary of the Lithuanian
party, told Lithuanian television the meeting Thursday ``went well;
it was successful.''
   Brazauskas and the entire Lithuanian party leadership met with
the national party's ruling Politburo in Moscow.
   Kestutas Zalauskas, party chief in the Vilnius, the Lithuanian
capital, told the republic's presidium that, when the meeting
began, ``Gorbachev was sitting with a very angry face, but at the
end of the meeting everything calmed down,'' said Longinas
Vasiliauskas, a party member who heard Zalauskas' report.
   Brazauskas said he told the Kremlin leaders Lithuanian
Communists must ``have a program that is acceptable to the people
and understandable to them'' for local elections scheduled in
February.
   Sajudis, the Lithuanian People's Front, trounced regular
Communist Party candidates in the Soviet Union's first multiple
candidate elections last spring. Sajudis candidates, including
Communist Party dissidents, won 36 of the 42 parliamentary seats in
the Lithuanian republic.
   The Lithuanian Communist Party has called a special congress for
Dec. 19 to prepare for the election and consider a program designed
to make the party ``a political force in the creation of an
independent, law-governed Lithuanian state.''
   A draft of the program endorses a multiparty system and creation
of a democratic socialist society. It does not call for secession
from the Soviet Union but would establish ``a sovereign Lithuanian
state that has cultural and economic ties with the U.S.S.R.'' It
makes no mention of political ties.
   The congress also will consider splitting the Lithuanian
Communist Party from the Soviet Communist Party, a move strongly
opposed by Gorbachev.
   Brazauskas said in the television interview that the Lithuanian
party's entire Central Committee will face election at the congress
to ensure that it represents party members.
   Zalauskas told the presidium the Moscow meeting centered on the
Soviet Politburo's objection to any separation of the Soviet and
Lithuanian parties, according to Vasiliauskas.
   He said Brazauskas calmed the Soviets by promising there would
be no immediate split, but the Lithuanians also told the Kremlin
leaders that ``democratization has gone so deep in Lithuania that
not everything depends on the Communist Party anymore.''
   The Kremlin has always maintained an element of control over the
Communist Parties in the various republics, naming its own man to
the number two spot and influencing the selection of the first
secretary.
   A report by the Tass news agency said Thursday's meeting
stressed ``the special responsibility which rests on the Lithuanian
Communist Party as one of the detachments of the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union.''

<HEAD>Workers Topple Statue of Pole Who Founded Soviet Secret Police</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WAR50</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the cheers and song of thousands of
onlookers Friday, workers toppled a statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky,
the Polish aristocrat who organized the Soviet secret police after
the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
   As the metal statue came crashing down, breaking into three
sections, many in the crowd hammered away at it, hoping to take
home a piece. The heavy metal did not bend or break under their
blows.
   ``Move back! Move back!'' the foreman told the crowd. ``We'll
give him (Dzerzhinsky) to you.''
   Under Dzerzhinsky's, rule the Cheka, forerunner of the KGB, was
responsible for a wave of terror against opponents of the new
Soviet regime. In Poland he was nicknamed ``Bloody Felix.''
   On Thursday, city workers started breaking apart the concrete
pavement around the base of the statue in the center of Warsaw.
   Slogans painted since Thursday on the base of the statue said,
``Felus, Tirana is waiting'' _ a reference to the capital of
Albania, which still pursues hard-line Stalinist policies. Felus is
a diminutive of Felix in Polish.
   Other slogans said, ``Beijing is all yours,'' and ``Don't come
back here.'' Another in English said simply, ``Go away.''
   Many Poles despised the large metal statue of Dzerzhinsky, who
founded the Cheka on orders from Soviet leader Vladimir I. Lenin.
Dzerzhinsky died in 1926.
   The monument was erected in 1951 at the height of Stalinism in
Poland on the prewar Bank Square which then became known as
Dzerzhinsky Square. City authorities say the prewar name will be
restored.
   A similar monument and square dedicated to Dzerzhinsky are
located in Moscow, not far from the Kremlin.
   The decision to tear down the monument in Warsaw was taken by
Jerzy Boleslawski, the Communist mayor, and announced Monday. The
government newspaper Rzeczpospolita quoted him as saying it would
make way for construction of a new subway system.
   Other monuments in Poland to Communist leaders of the Stalinist
era have been torn down since the independent Solidarity trade
union was made legal again in April.

   Leaders of the three main political
parties tried to form a joint government Friday, but failed,
increasing the possibility that a third election will follow two
that have ended in deadlock.
   ``The political consultations will continue on Monday at noon,''
conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis of the New Democracy
party told reporters afterward.
   He met with Andreas Papandreou, the former Socialist premier,
and Communist leader Harilaos Florakis. Since the Nov. 5 elections,
each has failed in a separate effort to form a coalition with a
majority in the 300-set Parliament.
   None of the three indicated whether progress was ade on Friday.
   If the three leaders cannot get together, President Christos
Sartzetakis is expected to call another election.
   Police meanwhile fought running battles Friday in central Athens
with youths who rioted on the fringes of a march commemorating a
student uprising Nov. 17, 1973.
   Three riot policemen and a reporter were slightly injured by
stones thrown by about 200 rioters who firebombed a police bus, a
department store and the entrance of an apartment block.
   More than 20 young people were killed in the revolt at the
Athens Polytechnic. The military regime collapsed in 1974 after
seven years in power.
   During Friday's melee, the rioters built burning roadblocks and
smashed the windows of six banks. Police said no one was arrested.
   Political observers believe the results of the next election
would be the same: no one party would win enough seats in the
300-member Parliament to govern alone.
   In the Nov. 5 balloting, New Democracy took 148 seats, three
short of an absolute majority, Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Movement won 128 and the Coalition garnered 21. Two independents
and an environmentalist took the remaining three seats.
   On June 18, elections also failed to produce a winner. A
conservative-communist government led the country until the
November elections.
   All three political leaders have said they want to avoid new
elections but differ on its goals and duration.
   Mitsotakis and Florakis said they favor an all-party government
that would govern until March when presidential elections will make
another poll mandatory if no candidate receives at least 180 votes
in Parliament.
   According to the constitution, new elections are called if
Parliament fails to choose a President. The newly elected
Parliament can then pick a president with a simple majority vote.
   Papandreou agrees with Florakis the electoral system should be
replaced by simple proportional representation, but Mitsotakis says
such a change would create unstable governments.
   The three parties are also divided over negotiations with the
United States on the continued presence of their military
installations in the country. A U.S.-Greek defense accord expired
in December.
   Despite 17 rounds of negotiations with a PASOK government before
it failed to be re-elected in June after eight years in office, the
bases issue remains unsolved.
   Papandreou said he wants one more round of negotiations before
the draft agreement is put to a national referendum. The
communist-led coalition said it would support an all-party
government only if the U.S. bases were shut down while Mitsotakis
said retaining the bases is vital to Greece's security.

<TEXT>
   About 10,000 people rallied outside
parliament Friday to demand that ousted leader Todor Zhivkov be
tried on allegations he amassed a fortune, and new Communist Party
chief Petar Mladenov said he favored free elections.
   The state-sponsored rally followed a shakeup in the Communist
Party and government leadership that forced out several Zhivkov
supporters. Mladenov, who replaced Zhivkov last week as party
chief, was named Friday to succeed him in the largely ceremonial
role of head of state.
   Mladenov told French television Friday that free elections were
``certainly possible.''
   ``As far as I am concerned, I am for free elections,'' Mladenov
said in the interview.
   However, he added that the leadership wanted first to study the
reform course of other East bloc countries. ``We must look, study,
and afterward we must make decisions,'' he said.
   At the rally, the crowd loudly cheered deputy Slavcho Trnski,
who launched an unprecedented attack on Zhivkov during the
parliament session. Marchers carrying banners for perestroika and
waving Bulgarian flags chanted ``Zhivkov to court!''
   Mladenov, in his acceptance speech to the parliament, or
National Assembly, leveled harsh criticism at Zhivkov without
mentioning him by name.
   He said the parliament, which has been a rubber-stamp body for
party policy, was ``deprived of its legal rights, ... (and) turned
into a facade of people's power. ... Such kind of situation cannot
be qualified otherwise but as an insult to the whole nation.''
   ``This refers to a most drastic deformation, one of the greatest
sins which our people and society will probably never forgive,''
Mladenov said, according to a text of the speech carried by the
state BTA news agency.
   ``The structures of the command and bureaucratic system are
beginning to shake,'' Mladenov was quoted as saying. ``The
administrative idols of yesterday are going to pieces.''
   Mladenov, formerly foreign minister, also spoke of radical
political and economic changes but was not specific.
   The crowd, estimated at 10,000 by Western journalists, booed
official speakers they apparently associated with Zhivkov.
   After the one-hour rally in front of the National Assembly
ended, about 500 people gathered at an unofficial rally and
chanted, ``We want democracy!'' and ``Down with the murderers!''
   They called out the names of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and Mladenov, marched down the street and then dispersed, calling
``See you tomorrow'' to one another.
   An unofficial rally planned for Saturday appears to have been
given official approval.
   On Thursday, the Communist Party Central Committee dismissed
three hard-line Politburo members and installed four men likely to
support Mladanov, 53, in implementing reforms.
   Trnski's attack was the first harsh public criticism of Zhivkov,
78, who gained power two years after Josef Stalin's death with the
aid of the Soviet dictator's supporters and ran the country in a
rigid, Stalinist fashion.
   The televised National Assembly session was the first glimpse
for most Bulgarians of the closed corridors of power from which
their lives have been controlled for two generations.
   In a hint of impending reform under Mladenov, legislators also
voted to strike Article 273 of the penal code, which was used to
punish anyone deemed to have slandered the state or party. That
means the country's new pro-reform groups may suffer less
harassment from police than before.
   An independent group called Committee 273 was formed this year
to press for the change.
   The National Assembly also removed some old guard Communists
from the government and created an Ecology Ministry to address
environmental concerns the led to formation of the independent
group Eco-Glasnost.
   Parliament dismissed Petko Danchev, a deputy premier, and Stoyan
Ovcharov, minister of economy and planning, from the government.
Both of are Zhivkov allies who were dropped Thursday as non-voting
members of the ruling Politburo.
   Stoyan Mihailov, a reformer who was removed from the Central
Committee last year and fired as party ideologist, was named
minister of education and culture _ an important post in Mladenov's
quest for support from intellectuals.
   Nikolai Dankerov was given the new Ecology Ministry and Voyko
Dimitrov succeeds Mladenov as foreign minister.
   The 400-member National Assembly voted unanimously by show of
hands to dismiss Zhivkov as head of state, then again to replace
him with Mladenov.
   In an unusually frank debate, deputies praised Mladenov's
``enthusiasm'' for reform and cricized Zhivkov.
   Trnski accused the former Communist Party chief of indulging in
a ``flamboyant lifestyle'' while Bulgaria fell into economic crisis.
   He said Zhivkov owned 30 homes, was ``hungry for fame'' and had
retained power through a policy of ``divide and rule.''
   The deputy also demanded an investigation of alleged misuse of
funds by Zhivkov's son Vladimir, who was removed from the Central
Committee on Thursday and is rumored to be involved in several
scandals.
   At the official demonstration outside the National Assembly
building, Trnski told the crowd: ``Sofia has not seen such an
emotional meeting in 45 years'' since the Soviet Army occupied the
country in September 1944.
   Cheers rose for Defense Minister Dobri Dzhurov, considered a
leading proponent of reform. He told the crowd the leadership
changes ``were made in the name of the people.''
   After an hour, the demonstrators sang the Bulgarian national
anthem and dispersed.

   A burst of wintry weather blew across the East on Friday,
dumping up to a foot of snow in New York and half a foot in West
Virginia and pushing freezing temperatures as far south as Florida.
   Snow was falling at midday in north-central and western New York
State; Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and northern Iowa. Blowing
and drifting snow remained over the eastern portion of the Dakotas.
   The heaviest accumulations hit south of Buffalo in the heart of
western New York's snow belt. Up to a foot fell at Little Valley
overnight, and 4 to 6 inches piled up across much of Chautauqua,
Wyoming and Erie counties.
   West Virginia also got a thick layer overnight, with 7 inches
falling at Pickens and 6 inches at Cheat Ridge and Shavers Fork.
   Two-and-three inch snowfalls were common over northwest
Minnesota.
   Heavy snow and strong winds blasted Upper Michigan into Thursday
night. Marquette received 14 inches of snow and 18 ships sought
protection in the St. Marys River and Lake Superior's Whitefish Bay
from winds up to 45 mph.
   In southern Michigan, authorities blamed slippery roads and poor
visibility for the deaths of an elderly couple killed when a truck
struck their car broadside.
   Strong winds and cold temperatures pushed the wind chill well
below zero over parts of the northern Plains today. At noon, the
wind chill at Devils Lake, N.D., was 36 below zero, while Fargo
registered 32 below zero.
   In northern Minnesota, where winds were calm, the midday
temperature was a chilly 7 degrees above zero at International
Falls and Hibbing. Those towns posted the lowest early morning
temperatures for the Lower 48 with readings of 4 degrees above zero.
   A frost warning was posted for Friday night over South Carolina,
and temperatures were expected to drop to near 30 degrees during
the night in northern Florida.
   Apalachicola, Fla., tied its record low for the date of 36 early
Friday.
   The cold set new record lows across Arkansas, including readings
of 8 degrees in Gilbert and 14 in Calico Rock, which broke the old
mark of 16 set in 1920. Mobile, Ala., tied its record low of 31,
and Mansfield, Ohio, set a new low with a reading of 19.
   Elsewhere, light rain extended over the Oregon Coast and the
lower Texas Gulf Coast.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 7 degrees at Detroit
Lakes, Minn., to 86 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.

   Leftist rebels killed five people, including
two newly elected mayors, authorities said Friday.
   The slayings Thursday brought to more than 135 the number of
officials and candidates killed by the Maoist rebel movement
Shining Path in an attempt to disrupt elections.
   Hundreds of officials have resigned out of fear, but millions of
Peruvians voted in municipal elections Sunday despite rebel threats.
   Mayor-elect Rosario Gomez of Uco, 185 miles north of Lima, was
shot down with three other people in the town plaza after a brief
``people's trial,'' said Domingo Huaman, an official of Ancash
state.
   Huaman said Gomez was elected on the ticket of the center-right
Democratic Front, a coalition supporting novelist Mario Vargas
Llosa, the front-runner in April's presidential election.
   Police said Shining Path rebels also assassinated Bendezu
Guillen, mayor-elect of San Juan de Castrovirreyna, 140 miles
southeast of Lima. Guillen was a member of the Aprista Party of
President Alan Garcia.
   Garcia said Thursday the Shining Path was ``probably looking for
a way to ruin the festival of democracy that was celebrated Sunday
throughout the country.''
   The National Elections Board said Friday that figures on the
total number of votes cast still were not available.
   The Shining Path began its insurgency in 1980 near Ayacucho and
now operates throughout the Andean highlands and in the
coca-producing jungles of the northeast. More than 15,500 people
have been killed, according to government figures.

<HEAD>Justice Says Reagan Subpoena Requires His Testimony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department regards a subpoena for
President Reagan in the Iran-Contra case of John Poindexter as a
demand for his testimony as well as for documents, a department
spokesman said Friday.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the Justice Department was
considering how to respond to Poindexter's subpoena for Reagan, but
declined to say whether or not the government would move to quash
it.
   ``That's a matter under consideration,'' Thornburgh said. ``We
have the judge's order and we are examining it in connection with
President Reagan's counsel.'' Telephone calls to the office of
Reagan lawyer Theodore Olson were not returned.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said that ``we think''
the subpoena for Reagan ``calls for his testimony'' as well as for
documents. The national security adviser's trial is scheduled to
start Jan. 22.
   The subpoena demands that Reagan turn over certain documents
next Wednesday.
   On Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene approved
Poindexter's subpoena to Reagan and a separate one to the archivist
of the United States, who has possession of presidential documents
from the Reagan administration.
   Ex-national security adviser Poindexter is accused of
conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of
making false statements. He says that many of the activities for
which he is now accused of crimes were authorized by Reagan and has
issued the subpoenas in an attempt to help bolster that assertion.

<TEXT>
   The flying swami who soared over the Berlin
Wall with a motorized kite in 1983 returned Friday with a batch of
balloons to commemorate his dardevil peace mission and reclaim his
machine from East Germany.
   On the whole, things worked better for Swami Vishnu Devananda
when the wall was intact.
   First, East German border guards at Checkpoint Charlie thought a
silver-haired swami with orange and red balloons emblazoned with
thanks to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was taking glasnost
a bit far.
   ``You're in East Germany now,'' a guard said as the swami, in
the pink-and-orange peace robes of his Canadian-based sect, went
through, followed by a half-dozen supporters. ``Take that stuff
back to West Germany.''
   ``O.K., O.K.'' the 62-year-old swami replied. He shoved a
homemade ``peace passport'' nd retraced his steps.
   Back in the West, he floated the balloons toward the wall, but
those that didn't burst on the branches of a tree floated right
back.
   At the Brandenburg Gate, the wind was wrong again. More
balloons, this time trailing pictures of his kite, floated
stubbornly westward.
   Ever resourceful, the swami tried his luck with a dozen doves.
Most of them flew west.
   Moving right along in the quest for something workable, the
swami's party arrived at the tiny airstrip on the edge of West
Berlin from which he took off in 1983.
   Then the real trouble started. A model plane supposed to fly
around trailing a small peace banner wouldn't start, then did but
crashed twice. When it finally was airborne, the banner was twisted
and unreadable.
   It was too late by then for the the highlight of the plan,
crossing into East Berlin to present a letter of thanks to
Communist leader Egon Krenz for answering the swami's prayers to
open the wall.
   Was that the end of the swami's tale of woe? Nope. His followers
discovered during the week that his kite had been destroyed.
   ``What can you do?'' he said, and shrugged. ``We'll go tomorrow.
I'd like to thank them anyway for being so nice when I was
arrested. They gave me a cheese sandwich and a subway ticket.''
   In 1983, the Indian-born swami landed his kite in a field
outside East Berlin, was sent back to the West after six hours of
interrogation. He leads the Svinanda Yoga Vendata sect based in
Quebec, which claims 100,000 members.

   They brought downtown Luebeck to
a near standstill, snatched up pineapples in Bavaria, and sipped
tea handed out by British soldiers in West Berlin. The East Germans
were back in force.
   Officials said late Friday that more than 1.2 million East
Germans had already poured into West Germany and West Berlin for a
second consecutive weekend of shopping and sightseeing.
   East Germany's official news agency ADN said the rush to the
West had reached ``a critical point,'' with traffic jams at all the
major crossing points into West Germany.
   West Germans, still a little bewildered by the deluge, did
everything they could to make the visitors feel welcome.
   Strict weekend store-closing laws were suspended in border
states, city tours were organized and stores stocked up on
clothing, fruits and other items that have long been only a dream
for East Germans.
   In Bad Homburg outside Frankfurt, hotels and pensions were
providing free rooms to the visitors, who also received bananas,
kiwis and oranges, courtesy of a local supermarket.
   Many downtown areas were wall-to-wall people, as special trains
brought the East Germans into Luebeck and other cities. At times,
the train platforms were so packed with East Germans that no one
could move.
   In West Berlin, West German rock star Udo Lindenberg led a group
of entertainers performing for the visitors, in one of numerous
free concerts nationwide.
   Hundreds of thousands snacked in the streets and gazed into the
windows of electronics stores.
   On the steps of the bomb-scarred Church of Remembrance, two men,
each clutching a can of beer, chanted ``East Berlin _ there is no
wall!''
   More than half of East Germany's 16.5 million people have
obtained exit visas to visit the West the past week, the ADN news
agency said. Last weekend, more than 3 million East Germans visited
the West.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers shot and wounded 15 Palestinians in
the occupied lands Friday and Palestinian militants stabbed and
injured two fellow Arabs they suspected of collaborating with
Israeli authorities.
   The army prepared to call up two reserve units of Jewish
settlers to serve in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel
radio and the independent Maariv newspaper reported.
   Maariv said the units would begin deployment in early December,
with one unit serving in Jericho and the other seeing duty
throughout the West Bank.
   It said a similar unit was called up 10 days ago to patrol
Jericho. If the report is true, it would be the first settler
reserve patrol in the West Bank since the Palestinian uprising
began 23 months ago.
   The scheduled deployment caused a furor among left-wing
legislators, who said units of right-wing settlers could increase
violence in the occupied territories.
   Critics also said deployment of the reserve ``regional defense
units,'' which in the occupied territories are primarily comprised
of setters, could politicize the army.
   In Israel, all Jewish men through age 54 serve up to 40 days
annual reserve duty. Until a spate of settler attacks against Arabs
several years ago, settlers often were assigned to reserve duty by
their homes.
   At least 615 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the
uprising and 42 Israelis have died. Twenty-four of the Arab deaths
have been attributed to settlers and the rest were killed by
soldiers.
   In the occupied West Bank, four Palestinians were wounded by
army gunfire and one Arab was shot in a clash with settlers, Arab
reporters said.
   The army confirmed one wounded in the West Bank by army gunfire
and said the military was investigating reports that a Palestinian
in the town of Ramallah was shot and wounded by settlers.
   In the Gaza Strip, 10 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with
troops.
   Two Arabs in Gaza City were stabbed and beaten by Palestinian
activists on suspicion of cooperating with Israeli authorities.
   At least 146 Arabs have been killed by fellow Palestinians
during the uprising on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.

   Terrified residents dodged
gunfire in smoldering streets Friday, desperately searching for
food and water after a week of battle between soldiers and rebels.
   Fighting slackened in many of the neighborhoods ravaged by the
exchanges of gunfire and government mortar and rocket fire in the
biggest guerrilla offensive of the decade-old civil war.
   Heavy combat continued in the northern district of Mejicanos,
where David Blundy, 44, a British journalist, was fatally wounded.
More than 800 people have been killed and about 2,000 wounded
nationwide in the offensive, according to a partial count by The
Associated Press.
   Officials say they had incomplete casualty figures for
civilians, many of whom have not been able to escape the fighting.
   ``We can no longer keep count of the dead who come in,''said
Juan Casco of the San Salvador city morgue.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross, the European
humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders and the International
Confederation of Free trade Unions called Friday for a temporary
cease-fire to allow the evacuation of wounded civilians.
   In Zacamil, a suburb west of Mejicanos, rebel forces abandoned
positions in a complex of low-income apartment blocks after days of
savage mortar and rocket attacks by government troops.
   By midday, soldiers of the elite Bracamonte Battalion were
moving through the smoldering, partially demolished buildings,
searching for booby-traps or bodies.
   Several thousand Zacamil residents fled in previous days,
staying with relatives, at a nearby church or sleeping in the open.
   In Soyapango, a poor district on the capital's eastern fringe,
guerrilla forces advanced after paratroopers weary from nearly a
week of heavy fighting withdrew.
   Small army patrols circulated cautiously, at times only a block
or two from guerrilla positions.
   Hundreds of residents, many carrying white flags, others with
empty plastic containers, walked the ruined streets in search of
water or a few ounces of beans or bread.
   Water mains have been damaged by the fighting in many
neighborhoods, and virtually all shops and markets have closed.
   ``We have no water! We have no food!'' dozens of people shouted
in Soyapango, surrounding journalists. ``Tell them to bring food
and water! Tell them to evacuate us!''
   A girl about 14 years old lay dead beside one road, surrounded
by residents who said she was hit by a stray bullet on a search for
provisions.
   ``We have nowhere to go,'' said Marcos Quintanilla, out looking
for food for his family. ``We're terrified by the bombardments.
Tell them to stop bombing us.''
   Soyapango has been one of the areas hardest hit by air attacks.
President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government has been using
its U.S.-supplied helicopters and warplanes to strafe and rocket
guerrilla positions in these neighborhood-strongholds.
   Quintanilla said dozens of people killed around his neighborhood
had been buried in the soccer field, and the bodies of others were
burned to prevent the spread of disease.
   Fidel Chavez Mena, leader the opposition Christian Democratic
Party, told a press conference Friday that more than 300,000 people
_ almost a third of the capital's population _ have been affected
by the fighting.
   Chavez Mena said the devastation is worse than a disastrous 1986
earthquake that killed 1,500 people died in that disaster, and left
nearly 300,000 homeless or with severely damaged homes.
   Reports from the countryside were sketchy. But journalists in
San Miguel, an eastern provincial capital, said by telephone that
combat was heavy in seven neighborhoods.
   Carlos Rodgiguez and his wife Marta were closing up their house
in the devastated eastern section of Soyapango _ until Thursday the
scene of some of the bloodiest house-to-house combat.
   On Thursday, each of the five members of the family had one
``tortilla,'' and few sips of coffee. They had run out of
everything else except a gallon of water.
   The front of their cinderblock home was pocked with bullets and
shrapnel, and part of the roof was blown off. Mrs. Rodriquez
pointed to the banana tree in the front yard.
   ``Look,'' she said. ``Even the poor little bananas are all shot
up.''

   Gov. Robert P. Casey on Friday signed a
bill giving Pennsylvania the most restrictive abortion law in the
country.
   The action makes Pennsylvania the first state to take advantage
of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July that gave states more leeway
in making their own abortion laws. It takes effect in 60 days.
   Casey said he believes the bill is constitutional and will not
provide a test case to challenge the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs.
Wade ruling, which gave women the constitutional right to an
abortion.
   In a statement, he said the provisions of the law ``are
appropriate and reasonable, given the enormity of the decision any
woman faces when she considers having an abortion. The overwhelming
votes in the state House and Senate convince me that the vast
majority of our people will agree.''
   The state House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of
143 to 58; the Senate approved it 33 to 17.
   The law bans abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy, except
to save the life of the mother or prevent ``substantial and
irreversible'' harm; prohibits abortions based on the fetus' sex;
requires women to inform their husbands if they plan to get an
abortion; regulates the medical use of tissue from aborted fetuses
and mandates that women wait 24 hours to get an abortion.
   Also under the law, doctors will have to inform women about the
procedure before performing an abortion and tell her the likely age
of the fetus, as well as explain risks and alternatives.
   The law carries stiff penalties for doctors who violate the
regulations; a conviction under the sex-selection ban or 24-week
provision could mean up to seven years in prison and $15,000 in
fines.
   The signing came on the same day that abortion-rights supporters
in Congress announced their intention to push a bill that would
write Roe vs. Wade into law.
   Sponsors of that bill said their aim was to take the fight over
rights to abortions away from state legislatures, allowing them to
impose only those restrictions that are medically necessary to
protect the life or health of the mother.
   Meanwhile, however, spirits were high among Pennsylvania's
anti-abortion activists. Rep. Stephen Freind, the Pennsylvania
Republican who led the Legislature's anti-abortion fight, called
the new law ``a great victory.''
   ``It gives a tremendous shot in the arm to the national pro-life
movement and ... it may well be used as a vehicle for the Supreme
Court to once again visit Roe vs. Wade,'' he said.
   Jenny Daughtry, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights League Pennsylvania chapter, criticized the bill as ``cruel
and demeaning and a direct attack on women's constitutional
rights.''
   ``Governor Casey's signature on this bill is an affront to the
health, welfare and interest of all Pennsylvanians. Pennsylvanians
will express their outrage over this attack on their rights at the
voting booth next November,'' she said.
   Casey, a Democrat, is expected to seek re-election next year.

<HEAD>House Approves Bill Exempting Agent Orange Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed legislation Friday that would
exclude payments from an Agent Orange lawsuit settlement from the
income measure used to determine eligibility for federal programs.
   Without such legislation, veterans who received money from a
civil court settlement with the makers of the herbicide Agent
Orange will continue to lose or suffer a reduction in food stamps,
supplemental security income and other federal benefits.
   The Senate passed a companion measure June 9, and Friday's voice
vote sends the measure to the White House for the president's
signature.
   A class-action suit was brought by veterans or their survivors
against the makers of Agent Orange, a dioxin-contaminated herbicide
used to remove ground cover in Vietnam.
   Under the settlement, approved in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn in July 1988, the manufacturers agreed to pay $180 million
to totally disabled veterans who whose health problems, inluding
cancers and birth defects in their offspring, resulted from
exposure.
   The court estimated the average payment per veteran would be
$5,700 over six years, or $950 a year. The maximum individual
payment is $12,800.
   Earlier legislation had eliminated means testing for eligibility
for veterans programs. The new legislation deals with the host of
other assistance programs provided by the government.
   The Veterans Affairs Department has yet to grant disability
benefits for veterans suffering from Agent Orange exposure on
grounds there is no proof of a connection and no way to determine
who was exposed.
   VA has begun re-examining that stance as the result of a court
order in San Francisco last May.

   The Afghan government keeps prisoners
penned ``like animals'' in deplorable cells, forced to stand or
squat for up to seven months while they await trial, according to a
U.N. human rights investigator.
   Malnutrition and infant mortality, meanwhile, are running
rampant in areas held by the Islamic rebels and in their refugee
camps in Pakistan, reported Felix Ermacora, a special
representative of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.
   Both sides are using weapons against civilians, and ``any such
use must be qualified as terrorism,'' he said.
   Ermacora visited Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran in September and
October to review human rights conditions and the plight of
refugees from the 10-year-old Afghan war.
   In Kabul, he found ``opponents of the regime are still being
tried by special security courts and the procedural guarantees of
the accused are not in conformity with international human rights
instruments.''
   Ermacora said there are still more than 3,000 political
prisoners in Afghanistan, and the conditions of those awaiting
trial are deplorable.
   ``They are kept like animals in small cells or rooms where they
have to stand or squat for an unspecified period of time (often as
long as seven months) behind iron bars, often with insufficient
light,'' he said.
   Ermacora also found what he said were serious human rights
violations by the Islamic rebels, who call themselves the
mujahedeen, or holy warriors.
   He criticized the rebels for their use of U.S.-made cluster
bombs, ``each of which contains 97 smaller time bombs. They
constitute one of the most frightening types of weapon currently
being used in the conflict.''
   In rebel-held areas and in their camps in Pakistan, Ermacora
said he was informed of ``increasing cases of malnutrition, in
particular among the children, due to food shortages.''
   He said 80 percent of the women and children seeking treatment
at the Kuwaiti Hospital for Afghans, in Peshawar, are suffering
from malnutrition.
   Ermacora estimated 5 million Afghans have become refugees, most
of them in Pakistan or Iran.
   The 2.3 million Afghan refugees in Iran mostly live in the major
cities where they are integrated into the population and hold jobs,
he said.
   They are in much better condition than the refugees in Pakistan
or the displaced Afghans still in their own country, who generally
live in overcrowded camps with little opportunity to become
self-reliant, he said.

<HEAD>Astronomers Find Biggest Structure in Universe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers have discovered a gigantic
collection of galaxies that they say is the biggest structure ever
seen in the universe.
   The structure, which they call the Great Wall, is so difficult
to explain that it raises new questions about theories of the
origin and structure of the universe.
   The researchers reported their discovery in Friday's issue of
the journal Science.
   The galaxies that make up the Great Wall form a sheet that is at
least 500 million light years long, or 3,000 billion billion miles,
and it is 200 million light years wide and 15 million light years
thick.
   By comparison, the earth's Milky Way galaxy is 100,000 light
years across. The entire universe is thought to be between 10
billion and 20 billion light years across.
   The Great Wall was discovered by Margaret Geller and John Huchra
of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge in
a detailed three-dimensional map they have been compiling of a
section of the heavens. The structure is so big that it appears to
run off the edges of the map.
   Geller said no one knows of a force that could have produced a
structure so big in the time since the universe was formed.
   ``My view is it's something really missing, something we really
don't understand,'' said Geller. ``It's not just a more complex
version of something we already know.''
   Astronomers say each new survey of skies turns up still bigger
structures.
   ``This is the latest chapter in a saga that's been going on
since the late 1970s,'' said Edwin Turner of Princeton University.
``We keep being surprised that we keep seeing something bigger as
we go out farther.''
   He said theories about how the universe arrived in its current
form already have been stretched by earlier discoveries, and it is
not clear whether the Great Wall ``will be the straw that broke the
camel's back.'' Virtually all current theories hold that the
universe began with a ``big bang'' about 15 billion years ago and
expanded rapidly into a highly uniform mix of matter and energy.
   In their report, the Cambridge scientists suggested building a
national observatory to extend the exploration of the universe.
They proposed a telescope with a light-gathering mirror four
meters, or 160 inches, across, giving it six times the
light-gathering power of the telescope used to find the Great Wall.
   ``With a telescope that size, you can not only look nearby, but
you can look at large enough distances where you can begin to see
how these structures really evolve,'' Geller said. ``That's one
thing we really have in our favor, that as we look out to greater
distances, we look back in time.''

   A gas explosion and fire in a coal
mine Friday trapped workers nearly a half-mile underground and
about 90 miners were feared dead, the Tanjug news agency reported.
It said 73 miners had escaped unharmed.
   A methane gas explosion and fire erupted at noon at the
Aleksinacki Rudnici mine, 120 miles south of Belgrade, as equipment
was being welded in a shaft about 2,300 feet underground, mine
director Branislav Mandusic told Tanjug.
   The state news agency quoted him as saying flames blocked the
mine's main access shaft and it was believed the miners perished
because of poisonous fumes.
   White smoke rising from the mine was visible from a distance of
at least one mile late Friday, and police kept relatives and
reporters well away from the pit, which is one mile outside the
town of Aleksinac.
   Rescue teams, including special units from other mines in the
region, were trying to extinquish the fire and reach the site of
the disaster.
   Tanjug reported Mandusic said all of the miners were equipped
with oxygen tanks but ``in the exceptionally grave circumstances
these could not be used.'' He did not elaborate.
   Mandusic said 73 miners left the pit safely, but they worked in
a different part of the mine. Earlier reports had said 104 miners
were trapped by the flames.
   A methane explosion at the same mine in 1983 killed 38 workers.
   Scores of people, including relatives of the missing miners,
gathered in freezing temperatures to await news of the missing
miners. Several survivors agreed there was little hope for their
trapped colleagues.
   ``The fire is still burning and the temperatures were too high
for us to get all the way through,'' said Zivorad Stojisavljevic, a
member of the rescue team.
   ``Coal dust and methane gas are still burning fiercely and it
could take a long time to put it out,'' said another rescuer,
Slobodan Stefanovic, who was carrying breathing equipment.
   Yugoslavia's worst coal mining accidents were at the Bosnian
mine at Kakanj and both were blamed on explosions of methane gas.
In 1934, an explosion and fire killed 127 miners and 128 miners
were killed in 1965.

   After an exhausting week of accolades from the
powerful of Washington, Lech Walesa spent a brief 40 minutes Friday
among Poles, the editorial staff of the largest Polish daily
newspaper outside Poland.
   He got the usual hero's welcome at Nowy Dziennik: a 10-foot
banner over the entrance to the midtown Manhattan building,
resounding applause as he entered the reception room, a plaque, and
even a ruby-studded 18-karat gold ring from a Polish-American
jeweler.
   The ring was big and Poland's best-known citizen received it
with the usual string of jokes.
   ``I like it a lot,'' he said. ``It looks very pretty and it's
very heavy so it speaks a lot about the greatness of Walesa.''
   The 50 or so people in the room laughed. Walesa, looking
fatigued, then begged for the gifts and praise to end, for some
Pole-to-Pole talk.
   ``How did you feel in Congress?''
   ``Oh, my God,'' he said to another chorus of mirth.
   The Gdansk shipyard worker whose deft negotiating skills helped
turn a labor movement into the political force that dominates
Poland's government took his now-familiar ``I'm just a simple
electrician'' tack.
   ``I have a complex, standing next to all those greats,'' he said
of the political figures he met in Washington. Walesa has said he
was weak-kneed during his address Wednesday to a joint session of
Congress.
   ``But you too are great,'' offered Boleslaw Wierzbianski,
longtime publisher of the 23,000-circulation Nowy Dziennik (Daily
News).
   The paper has worked hard on Solidarity's behalf, raising about
$200,000 for the spring electoral campaign that led to the free
trade union movement's victory in all but one of the races in which
it fielded a candidate.
   When he arrived, Walesa thanked the staff for all its efforts
but asked them not to expect wisdom.
   ``This is my 10th meeting (today) so I'm worn out and I'm going
to speak to you without any deep thought,'' he said. For the first
time all week, a translator was not needed.
   Walesa squirmed out of an answer when asked what three things he
would do first to revive his country's devastated economy: ``I'm
not the government. I'm Lech Walesa, who makes connections.''
   When asked if he didn't fear that the Solidarity-led government
would alienate the very workers who have been its core of support
by closing down huge obsolete factories, he presented his vision of
Poland's future.
   ``I must open tens of thousands of small manufacturers, butcher
shops, bakeries,'' he said. That would offer people more than they
currently are paid working for state-owned enterprises.
   With foreign investors pouring in to do business, ``we'll solve
the problem,'' he said. ``We'll turn the old factories into museums
to Marxism-Leninism.''
   One questioner asked Walesa why he had not yet found a half hour
to talk to the thousands of Poles in New York who not only have
sent millions of dollars to Poland but also voted for Solidarity in
the June elections.
   Walesa appeared a bit hurt but defended his priority for his
first visit to the United States: meeting with bankers,
industrialists and politicians in search of direly needed
investment. ``Our political victory will be for naught if I don't
cement it economically,'' he said.
   ``I apologize to the workers,'' added Walesa, who was to take
time to meet the people at a rally in Chicago on Saturday. ``I
should be in each Polish house, but I simply don't have enough
time.''
   Soon, he was excusing himself, promising:
   ``I'll do everything that I can so you can have two loves,
Poland and America.''

   A rare document in which George Washington
proclaimed the nation's first Thanksgiving holiday 200 years ago
was recently discovered and went on display Friday.
   The proclamation, dated Oct. 3, 1789, is one of 13 President
Washington sent to the states, but it is the only original known to
exist today, said Herman Darvick, a New York auctioneer of
autographs and historical documents who confirmed its authenticity.
   Peter F. Paul, president of the non-profit American Spirit
Foundation, said he found the proclamation among a collection of
his mother's historical documents and maps about a month ago.
   ``I was so moved by it when I read it. I asked around and
learned this really is something extraordinary,'' Paul said.
   In his proclamation, Washington called for a day of public
thanksgiving and prayer to give thanks to God for giving Americans
``an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for
their safety and happiness.''
   The 18-by-26-inch document was put on display Friday at the
Huntington Library, a prestigious institution in San Marino,
Calif., a Los Angeles suburb. With it is a letter signed by
Washington that was sent with the proclamation to Gov. Thomas
Mifflin of Pennsylvania.
   Mary Robertson, curator of manuscripts at the Huntington, said
the museum tries to highlight holidays with historical displays.
   ``This was a little bit unusual in that it's a rare
proclamation,'' she said.
   Darvick confirmed the document's authenticity, based on
comparisons of the paper size and printing quality with other
government proclamations of the period. He estimated it is worth
between $80,000 and $100,000.
   But both Darvick and Paul said the document's real value lies in
what it can teach Americans on the 200th anniversary of the holiday.
   ``Not many Americans know where Thanksgiving originated,'' Paul
said. ``It's one of the most moving and articulate documents to be
published by the government in its history.''
   Libraries at Harvard and Yale, as well as the Morgan Library in
New York, have smaller versions of the document, Darvick said, but
they apparently were copies printed to spread word of the
proclamation.
   Commemorations of the pilgrim's first harvest celebration in
Plymouth Colony in 1621 were held sporadically during colonial
times, but Washington proclaimed the nation's first Thanksgiving
Day for Nov. 26, 1789.
   Abraham Lincoln revived the custom in 1863, proclaiming the last
Thursday of November as Thanksgiving. Beginning in 1939, President
Roosevelt proclaimed Thanksgiving as the third Thursday in
November, but a Congressional resolution in 1941 moved the holiday
to where it has stayed since _ the fourth Thursday of the month.
   Washington's proclamation called on Americans to give thanks for
the end to the Revolutionary War, ``for the peaceable and rational
manner in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of
government for our safety and happiness and particularly the
national one now lately instituted; for the civil and religious
liberty with which we are blessed, and the means we have acquiring
and diffusing useful knowledge; and in general, for all the great
and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us.''

   First-grader Megan Lambert wanted to go to
her school Friday, even though it was closed and she had nightmares
about the cafeteria wall that was toppled by a tornado and killed
seven of her schoolmates.
   ``Something like this happens, your mind can never get off it,''
said the 7-year-old who escaped injury in Thursday's storm at East
Coldenham Elementary School.
   Anne Crowley, will attend service Sunday. 7 p.m.
   ``Some of my friends are dead and some more may get dead,''
Megan said.
   More than 100 first-, second- and third-graders were eating when
a tornado slammed into the 30-foot concrete-and-glass wall, killing
seven children and injuring 18 others. Thirteen remained
hospitalized Friday, three in critical condition.
   The National Weather Service had posted a tornado watch for
large parts of the East Coast from Maryland to New England,
including the Newburgh area and metropolitan New York, as storms
along a rapidly moving cold front caused tornadoes, high winds and
heavy rain from the Southeast to New England.
   The two-day toll from the storms was at least 29 dead and
hundreds injured, including 17 dead and 1,000 homeless in
Huntsville, Ala., which was struck by a large twister Wednesday
evening.
   President Bush issued a disaster declaration Friday for
Huntsville, making the city eligible for federal relief programs,
said Gov. Guy Hunt's press secretary, Terry Abbott.
   Hunt said he believed damage exceeded $100 million.
   Another tornado Thursday knocked over trees and ripped roofs off
houses in West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle, the National Weather
Service confirmed. And a tornado ripped the roof off an office
building in King of Prussia, Pa., outside Philadelphia.
   Storms also caused flooding in Washington, D.C., blew windows
out of skyscrapers in Philadelphia, destroyed a house in
Piscataway, N.J., and blew the roof off a shopping mall in Quebec.
   At Newburgh, National Weather Service meteorologist Roland
Loffredo said wind blew about 100 mph near the school during
Thursday's storm, but the strongest wind was at a higher altitude
and the school did not bear the full brunt of the storm.
   ``It was very fortunate actually, in spite of the tragedy it
could have been worse,'' said Loffredo, who said his survey of
damage and witness accounts led him to believe a strong tornado
caused the damage at the school.
   The 27-year-old school was last inspected in 1984, said James
Coonan, superintendent of the Valley Central School District.
   Rotting wood was found around some windows then and was
replaced, he said. ``It was as strong as it could be,'' Coonan said.
   Coonan called off classes Friday for the 4,000 children in the
seven-school system.
   The district's high school and middle school will be open all
weekend ``for those who need emotional support,'' Coonan said.
Counselors will be available all weekend at Berea Elementary
School, two miles from the damaged school, he said, and they will
be stationed at all district schools when they reopen.
   A memorial service to be held Sunday night in the high school
auditorium will be attended by Gov. Mario Cuomo, said his
spokeswoman, Anne Crowley.
   Representatives of Cuomo also will attend a meeting called
Saturday by U.S. Rep. Hamilton Fish to discuss aid for the school
district and families of the victims, Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryer
said.
   A 9-year-old girl was in critical condition Friday at Albany
Medical Center Hospital, a spokesperson said. A 7-year-old boy and
a 7-year-old girl were in critical condition at Westchester County
Medical Center in Valhalla, and a 6-year-old girl was listed as
serious, a spokesperson said.
   Nine other children remained in two area hospitals, most in
satisfactory condition. The five others injured were treated and
released.
   East Coldenham will reopen for classes Tuesday, but Coonan urged
parents to take their children to the school on Monday to reassure
them that the building is safe.
   Contractors in the area offered to rebuild the cafeteria wall
for free, but Coonan wouldn't say if he had accepted any offers.
   Mar Routson took her two daughters to the boarded-up school
Friday even though her daughter attends first grade at another
school.
   ``I wanted to show them the school is OK,'' she said.
   ``This is a small community. We all feel this. These are our
children, not your children who were hurt,'' Routson said.
   Megan Lambert had trouble sleeping Thursday night because she
kept thinking of her best friend, Kayla McDowell, who was in
serious condition Friday, according to her mother, Beth Lambert.
   Brian Jablonski, 13, said his sister, a fourth grader at the
school, was shaken up.
   ``She seemed to be able to sleep through anything but always
woke up when the wind blew,'' he said.
   Sean Benson, a fourth grader, said he was in music class when
the wall collapsed.
   ``Everybody started screaming down the hall,'' the 10-year-old
said. ``We laughed at that because we thought they were just scared
because of the storm.
   ``Then a teacher came in and she was crying.''

   A Trenton, N.J.,
teacher and peace activist working with a volunteer church group
was arrested Friday by Salvadoran troops, her sister told New
Jersey's two U.S. senators.
   Teresa Fitzgibbon, 53, was arrested with two others around noon
Friday, said Peggy Fitzgibbon, a Catholic nun living in Washington.
   Peggy Fitzgibbon said her sister ``had already been twice to
Salvador. She'd been to Honduras to a camp for refugees. When she
went down for the third trip, everybody said, `you're crazy.''
   According to Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., Teresa Fitzgibbon was
part of a Lutheran church group composed of American, Canadian, and
West German doctors and nurses. They had been given sanctuary in a
church to provide medical care to refugees from the fighting in San
Salvador.
   Peggy Fitzgibbon said she learned of her sister's arrest from
Isabel Torres, a Houston woman whose fiance was a member of the
church group and who has been in telephone contact with the group
in El Salvador.
   ``Last night, the Salvadoran National Guard burst in and
arrested a number of those with whom Teresa had been working; this
morning, the remainder of the group, including Teresa, were
detained in the church,'' Bradley said in a statement. ``At latest
report, the church is now surrounded by El Salvadoran military
forces. This is outrageous and intolerable.''
   Bradley said he was calling up on the government of El Salvador
to release Ms. Fitzgibbon, and upon those participating in the
civil war ``to return to basic humanitarian norms in order to spare
the lives of the people in whose interests they claim to be
fighting.''
   Steven Schlein, a spokesman for Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
said the senator had contacted Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger who said he was looking into the matter.
   According to Schlein, Lautenberg had met Teresa Fitzgibbon on
Nov. 6 and told her he would provide a letter identifying her as a
constituent.
   The letter was written by Lautenberg's Newark office ``as a way
of providing her some added protection,'' another spokesman said.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
told reporters earlier in the day there might be as many as nine
Americans, including at least some members of the Lutheran group,
who were arrested in El Salvador between Wednesday evening and
Thursday afternoon.
   ``Our embassy officials have already contacted the Salvadoran
security forces and have been assured of consular access,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said.

<HEAD>Imelda Marcos Plans Trip To Mainland To Help Prepare Defense</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos is
under government orders not to leave the island of Oahu, but she
plans to go to San Francisco next month to help prepare her
defense, her attorney said Friday.
   ``The U.S. government cannot interfere with her right to assist
in her defense and I don't believe they have any interest in doing
that,'' San Francisco attorney John Bartko said in a telephone
interview.
   Mrs. Marcos faces federal criminal fraud and racketeering
charges, and her trial is scheduled to begin March 14 in New York.
Her husband, exiled former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos,
faced the same charges but died Sept. 28.
   They were accused of siphoning nearly $200 million from their
country's treasury and stashing it in the United States.
   Mrs. Marcos has lived here since February 1986, when a popular
revolt ended her husband's 20-year rule and sent them into exile.
   She is under an Immigration and Naturalization Service order
that prohibits her from leaving the Hawaiian island of Oahu. She is
also required to meet weekly with a probation officer.
   Bartko said he was ``in the process'' of submitting a formal
request to U.S. authorities to allow the trip and said he was
confident it would be granted.
   ``They'll want to know where she is, who she's with, where she's
staying,'' Bartko said. ``She'll have to check in, but that's not a
problem.''
   Bartko said Mrs. Marcos needed to review more than 300,000
prosecution documents her defense team has compiled. She would also
help compile witness lists, review testimony and generally prepare
for her trial.
   Bartko said Mrs. Marcos also might seek to meet with attorneys
in New York and that no return date was set.
   The government turned over an additional 6,000 documents last
week and the defense has petitioned prosecutors for more, he said.
   ``The sheer task of understanding all of the documents demands
more than putting this stuff in your briefcase and flying to
Hawaii,'' Bartko said.
   It would be Mrs. Marcos' first trip to the mainland since her
October 1988 arraignment in New York. She pleaded innocent and was
freed on $5 million bail.
   Donald Radcliffe, the INS district director here, said the
request must be submitted at least two days before the planned
departure. He refused to say if he thought it would be approved.
   Roger Peyuan, Mrs. Marcos' spokesman, said she would stay with
her daughter, Irene Araneta, in Woodside, Calif., and hoped to be
back in Honolulu by Christmas.
   Bartko refused to discuss any defense team negotiations with
government prosecutors.
   ``I just wouldn't tell you about that,'' he said. ``For those
negotiations to be productive, they must be kept private.''

   The Senate ethics committee on Friday retained
outside counsel to analyze and gather information on allegations
that Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato violated ethics rules.
   The committee previously had asked the New York Republican to
respond to a complaint by a former campaign rival, who contended
D'Amato broke Senate rules in the federal housing scandal and other
matters.
   The panel hired Washington, D.C. criminal defense lawyer Robert
S. Bennett ``to assist the committee in determining whether or not
to proceed to a preliminary inquiry,'' according to a statement by
Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala. and Vice Chairman Warren Rudman,
R-N.H.
   The inquiry is the first of three stages of a formal
investigation. Rudman said it could take several months before the
decision on a preliminy proceeding is made.
   ``Sure, let them do it. I'm not concerned,'' D'Amato said.
   D'Amato spokesman Frank Coleman confirmed Friday that the
committee had asked D'Amato for a response to the complaint, which
was filed in July. D'Amato said, ``We're preparing the answers ...
we'll submit them to the committee.''
   The spokesman said D'Amato had not hired an attorney to
represent him ``because at this point, there is no case.''
   Last summer Mark Green, who ran against D'Amato in 1986, filed a
complaint with the ethics committee saying there was ``substantial
evidence'' that D'Amato broke Senate rules and federal law. Green
cited news reports alleging D'Amato involvement in the Wedtech
scandal and influence peddling at HUD.

   The chairman of the Democratic
National Committee said Friday President Bush has not shown
leadership in the face of such world events as the war in El
Salvador and the changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``We ought to be focusing on what is happening in our own
hemisphere and providing leadership there. That has not been
forthcoming,'' Ron Brown said at the opening of the association of
state Democratic leaders meeting in Puerto Rico.
   ``In Europe and the emerging democracies around this world one
of the biggest disappointments is that where America provided
leadership in the past we are now following, trying to catch up,
and seem surprised by every turn of events,'' he said.
   Brown said Democrats in Congress will try to fill the gap left
by Bush in the international scene, but he did not elaborate.
   The meeting ends Saturday.

   Conservatives and leftists jockeyed
Friday to form alliances for a runoff election next month, and
officials worked to finish counting the votes from the first round
of balloting.
   Conservative Fernando Collor de Mello led the 21-candidate field
with 27.6 percent of Wednesday's vote, the Superior Electoral Court
said with 64.28 percent of the ballots counted.
   Collor de Mello, of the center-right National Reconstruction
Party, appeared to have guaranteed first place in the first free
balloting for president since a 21-year military regime ended in
1985.
   In the runoff Dec. 17, he appeared likely to face off with one
of two leftist candidates who battled for the No. 2 spot.
   Rep. Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, of the radical left Workers
Party, was in second place with 16.4 percent. Leonel Brizola, of
the center-left Democratic Labor Party, was third with 14.1 percent.
   However, more than half the votes from the heavily populated
southern states of Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul _ Brizola
strongholds _ had not yet entered the government's computers, the
Superior Electoral Court said in a statement.
   Collor de Mello reportedly was seeking support on the left to
shake an image as the representative of conservatives and the
wealthy. He has made contacts with top advisors of Sen. Mario
Covas, the candidate of the left-center Brazilian Social Democracy
Party who was running a strong fourth.
   ``Anyone we eventually negotiate with must be committed to our
program, which gives priority to industrial development, economic
growth, a fairer distribution of income, social welfare and
strengthening the domestic market,'' Collor de Mello said in a
televised interview at his home in Brasilia, the capital.
   Brizola and Lula pledged to forget the personal rivalry that
marked the campaign and support the winner of their battle for the
second spot.
   Brizola's political advisor, Rep. Vivaldo Barbosa, said the
candidate would seek alliances with ``all progressive forces'' and
with ``lucid conservatives.''
   Workers Party president Rep. Luiz Gushiken said the party would
hold a national convention Nov. 25 to discuss alliances.
   ``We will deepen the ideological debate and show that Collor is
the candidate of the right,'' he said.
   As Brazilians awaited the outcome, financial markets reflected
uneasiness.
   On Thursday, the Rio stock market fell 10 points with news of an
advance by Lula, a former union boss who has scared businessmen
with promises to nationalize banks and limit profits.

   Abortion-rights supporters in Congress,
setting the stage for a political battle next year, announced their
intention Friday to push a bill that would write into law the 1973
Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.
   The bill they introduced would, in effect, overcome the Supreme
Court's decision last summer in the so-called Webster case that
gave states greater authority to impose restrictions on abortions,
supporters said.
   Just a few lines long, the bill would forbid states from
restricting a woman's right to have an abortion before the time her
fetus becomes viable for life outside the womb, or at any time when
necessary to protect the life or health of the mother.
   Sponsors said their aim was to take the fight over rights to
abortions away from state legislatures, allowing them to impose
only those restrictions that are medically necessary to protect the
life or health of the mother.
   Although no action was expected until next year, abortion-rights
backers said the bill would become the central focus of future
congressional and political debate on the abortion issue.
   A result, they said, would be to thrust the abortion issue even
further into the politics of the 1990 House and Senate races.
   ``This bill is the moral equivalent for women of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore.
   A leader of the abortion opponents, Rep. Christopher Smith,
R-N.J., said he welcomed the bill because it would bring a full
debate on abortion. He said he was confident the House would defeat
it.
   ``I hope they bring the bill to the floor very quickly,'' he
said. ``The question will then be very squarely: `Will we permit
abortion on demand for the whole nine months of pregnancy?'''
   The House bill had 88 sponsors, and a version introduced in the
Senate carried 19 sponsors.
   The bill was aimed at writing into law the landmark 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision establishing a woman's right to an abortion and at
reversing the Webster case. Abortion-rights supporters contend the
Webster decision eroded rights established 16 years earlier, and
signaled a possible further erosion in future high-court decisions.
   The Webster decision, however, has energized abortion-rights
leaders and raised the temperature of the abortion debate in many
states. Democrats won elections in New Jersey and Virginia last
week in outcomes credited to increasing public sentiment for
abortion rights.
   On the other hand, the Pennsylvania legislature passed a bill
imposing new restrictions on abortion, including requirements for a
24-hour waiting period and that women notify their husbands
beforehand. Gov. Robert P. Casey signed the bill into law on Friday.
   ``The Webster decision forced us to go back to the legislative
basics,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif. ``Now the focus is on the
basic right. I look forward to this being the centerpiece of the
abortion fight next year.''
   ``This bill is going to be the rallying point,'' said Rep.
Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., an abortion-rights supporter who met
with President Bush on the issue this week and who is weighing a
1990 race for the Senate. Bush is appearing at a fund-raising event
for her Monday, despite their differences on abortion.
   Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore., predicted passage by both the
House and Senate but acknowledged supporters would probably not be
able to override a presidential veto.
   Abortion-rights supporters in the Senate on Thursday ended their
efforts to overcome Bush's veto of a bill that would extend
Medicaid abortions to women who are victims of rape or incest. Both
the House and Senate agreed to provisions keeping the current
prohibition on federal payment for abortions except in cases where
the life of the mother is endangered.
   Both sides also were watching to see whether Bush would sign or
veto a spending bill for the District of Columbia. He vetoed an
earlier version because it permitted federal financing of abortions
in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother.
Congress passed a new version that prohibits use of federal funds
except to save the mother's life, but would permit the city to use
its own funds in all other cases.
   ``If he signs it, it will be a victory for us,'' AuCoin said.

   President Bush on Friday signed a bill that
will raise the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.25 an hour by the
spring of 1991, formally accepting the compromise that ended a year
of disagreement with congressional Democrats and organized labor.
   Bush praised the measure, which he said would ``protect jobs and
put more money into the pockets of our workers.'' But Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said it merely marked progress ``to the
50-yard line'' on the issue.
   The increase, the first since 1981, would bring the wage to
$4.25 an hour by April 1991, after going to an intermediate $3.80
on April 1, 1990.
   The new law also includes a lower ``training wage'' for new
workers who are teen-agers, a provision sought by Bush but
initially opposed by congressional Democrats.
   Bush in June vetoed a bill that would have increased the minimum
wage to $4.55 over three years.
   At an Oval Office signing ceremony attended by congressional
leaders and sponsors, Bush called the new act ``a good example of
what we can do in the future on other matters.''
   ``I have called for an increase in the minimum wage that would
protect jobs and put more money into the pockets of our workers. In
my view, this bill does exactly that. I'm pleased to sign it,''
Bush said.
   However, Kennedy, D-Mass., who supported a higher minimum, said
after the ceremony, ``I think we've arrived on the 50-yard line on
this.''
   ``It's not as much as the working poor deserve, but it was a
real compromise and it brought the president's position to one of
not saying take it or leave it,'' Kennedy, chairman of the Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee, told reporters.
   Kennedy said a Democratic-led effort to boost the wage further
in 1992, a presidential election year, was ``a live option.''
   Under terms of the new law, young people 16-to-19 years old who
have never worked could be paid 85 percent of the minimum wage for
90 days. Employers with a training plan in place could pay the
young workers a training rate for 90 days more.
   The training wage can be paid to workers 16-19 years old for
their first three months of work experience and for three
additional months provided they are in certified training programs.
   The training wage would be $3.35 an hour after next April 1.
When the minimum wage increases to $4.25 a year later, the
subminimum would increase to $3.61 an hour. The provision allowing
for the subminimum expires in April 1993 unless extended by
Congress.
   Bush called for a $4.25 minimum wage during his campaign.
   Also at the signing ceremony were Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole; Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine; House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.; Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan.; House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.; House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.; Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., and Rep.
William Goodling, R-Pa.
   Murphy is chairman of the House subcommittee on labor standards,
and Goodling is the senior Republican member on the House Education
and Labor Committee.

   President Bush presented the National Medal of
Arts to 12 Americans Friday, not including conductor and composer
Leonard Bernstein who had declined the honor in a newly moot
controversy over a federal grant.
   ``Thank you for your achievements, for the passion you bring to
the arts,'' Bush told the honorees, who included novelist John
Updike, trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, dancer-choreographer Katherine
Dunham, and Czeslaw Milosz, a poet who won the Nobel Prize in 1980.
   ``You have honored this country,'' the president said. ``The
nation is grateful to you.''
   An award also was made, posthumously, to pianist Vladimir
Horowitz, who died Nov. 5.
   Bernstein told the White House on Tuesday he would not accept
the medal, reportedly because the National Endowment for the Arts
cancelled a $10,000 grant for a New York art exhibit about AIDS.
Another winner was hastily substituted, but his or her identity was
not disclosed.
   Bernstein, in a written response published in The Washington
Post's Saturday editions, apologized to Barbara Bush for declining
the invitation to the luncheon and criticized conservatives who
seek to limit arts funding.
   Bernstein's statement said, ``Dear conservatives: What are you
conserving? Democracy and human freedom, I should hope.''
   He added, ``A catalogue is not, nor need be, a work of art,''
apparently referring to the fact that John Frohnmayer, chairman of
the endowment, canceled the grant after seeing the show's catalogue.
   Bernstein also said, ``It has been called to my attention that
in declining the once-accepted invitation to lunch at the White
House I may have offended my hostess, in which case I sincerely
apologize to Mrs. Bush.''
   Frohnmayer reinstated the $10,000 grant on Thursday, saying he
had done so after viewing the exhibition, ``Witnesses: Against our
Vanishing.''
   As he read the awards citation in the East Room of the White
House on Friday, Frohnmayer made no mention of the controversy.
   The medal recipients included one corporation, Dayton Hudson, of
Minneapolis _ a store chain that in the last 10 years has
contributed more than $60 million to arts programs.
   The others were:
   Leopold Adler II, a real estate developer in Savannah, Ga., and
a preservationist, ``for his civic leadership in preserving for all
time the beauty of Savannah;'' Alfred Eisenstaedt, a pioneer
photojournalist, ``for the extraordinary photographs that document
the tragedies and triumphs he has witnessed over a lifetime;''
Martin Friedman, Minneapolis, ``for opening the doors of his museum
to the best of all of the arts of our time;''
   Lee Gerdine, ``the spiritual father of the Arts in St. Louis;''
Walter Hancock, a St. Louis sculptor; Robert Motherwell, a painter
in Greenwich, Conn., ``for reflecting in his art the very essence
of American freedom.''
   Miss Dunham was honored ``for her pioneering explorations of
Caribbean and African dance;'' Gillespie ``for his trail-blazing
work as a musician;'' Milosz ``for glorious poetry and prose;'' and
Updike ``for novels and stories that over a 40-year career have
given us a wryly affectionate yet penetrating analysis of the
complexity of life in today's America.''
   Eisenstaedt, who is 90, was not at the ceremony and his award
was accepted for him.
   The president and Mrs. Bush shook hands with each recipient.
   ``Art defines our civilization,'' said the president. ``You can
see and hear and even feel life through the mind of someone else
for new perspectives. Instead of seeing a single world, we can see
as many worlds as there are artists, writers, dancers and
musicians.''

   The assassination of six
Jesuits Thursday was the latest attack against their order in Latin
America, where conservatives have viewed them as dangerous
revolutionaries for the past two centuries.
   It was not the first attack on the Society of Jesus in this
Massachusetts-sized country, which is wracked by a decade-old civil
war that has claimed more than 70,000 lives.
   The Revs. Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of Jose Simeon Canas Central
American University; vice-rector Ignacio Martin-Baro and educators
Amado Lopez, Juan Ramon Moreno and Joaquin Lopez Lopez were slain
and mutilated early Thursday.
   Two witnesses said government soldiers in uniform were involved,
according to the Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit order's
superior for Central America. The government denied the charges.
   The Jesuit university, one of the region's most prestigious
institutions of education, had been the target of two previous
attacks this year.
   On April 29 and July 22, bombs exploded at the entrance of the
university and in the printing shop where it publishes its academic
tracts and monthly review of social and political issues.
   No one was injured in those two bombings, but damage to property
was considerable. The university blamed rightist elements within
the military.
   ``This attack is the latest in a long chain, constantly incited
by an insidious campaign of calumny and libel against this
institution and the Jesuits who work here,'' said a statement put
out by the university July 22.
   ``Once more, physical violence follows moral violence, and the
bomb is precipitated by libelous accusation. The impunity and
treachery with which these deeds are done cannot hide the
responsibility of those who incite them, pay for them and cover
them up,'' the statement added.
   The April and July bomings followed publication in rightist
newspapers of several private advertisements labeling Ellacuria,
Martin-Baro and Montes apologists for leftist rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   In 1977, the Rev. Rutilio Grande _ another Jesuit _ was slain by
a rightist death squad as he drove to the poor rural parish of
Aguilares, where he was teaching people to fight for civic and
human rights.
   Attacks and criticism of the Society of Jesus, one of the
continent's most controversial and socially active groups, date
back to the Spanish colonial times.
   In 1767, the Vatican, pressured by South American landowners and
businessmen, expelled the Jesuits from the continent as a result of
their ``theocratic-socialist'' missionary work among Indians in
what today is Paraguay.
   In recent years, the ``liberation theology'' movement has been
viewed as subversive by conservatives in power in Latin America. In
many countries Jesuits have been in the fore of the movement, which
expresses a ``preferential option for the poor.''

   Sandra Good remains devoted to Charles
Manson but has a newfound devotion that has forced her to shed the
anonymity she's cultivated since her release from prison in 1985.
   Good served 10 years for writing threatening letters to
corporations she accused of polluting. Now she's campaigning to rid
Lake Champlain of pollution she says is coming from an
International Paper Co. mill in Ticonderoga, N.Y.
   ``I don't want people to focus on who I am, but what I'm
saying'' she told the Rutland Herald on Wednesday.
   Good, who had been using an assumed name, acknowledged her
identity when questioned by the newspaper about reports that she
was an area resident.
   Although she was a disciple of Manson, Good was never implicated
in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and six others that led
to the convictions of Manson and three members of his ``family.''
   Good shared an apartment with Manson follower Lynette
``Squeaky'' Fromme, who is serving a life sentence for the
attempted assassination of President Ford. After Fromme's arrest
investigators found 3,000 letters Good had written to companies
such as Union Carbide Corp., warning of death or disaster if they
continued to pollute the environment.
   Upon her parole in 1985, Good came to Vermont. She dropped her
last name and went by her first and middle names: Sandra Collins.
   ``I didn't want to be photographed. I didn't want to be
recognized. The scope of the past is so huge. The media created
their own version of what we were about. It wasn't the truth,'' she
said.
   She first lived in Burlington, then the small town of St.
George, and then three years ago moved to Bridport, near Lake
Champlain, the nation's sixth-largest fresh-water lake.
   ``When I first came here, I knew the lake was sick,'' she said.
``I looked at the lake and I knew something was wrong.''
   Good and her housemate, Earl Parsons, who owns their lakefront
home, have been leaders in the fight against the paper company.
   Pollution from the plant has been a controversial issue since
the mill was built in 1971. Recently the company settled a federal
lawsuit alleging the mill's pollution caused a nuisance and lowered
lakeshore property values.
   The settlement requires the company to deposit $5 million into a
fund for research on the lake and make payments to property owners.
Good and Parsons have refused to accept any money, calling the
settlement ``a monumental buy-off.''
   Until the Herald article on Thursday, Good had been quoted in
numerous articles in recent months about the pollution, but under
her assumed name.
   Good said she had wanted to continue to conceal her identity but
felt the future of the lake was too important.
   ``If I cared so much about what people think, I would have
stayed in the closet,'' she said.

   The Coast Guard said it recovered
about 200 pounds of cocaine Thursday floating in three ice chests
near the offshore island of Vieques.
   The cocaine was stacked in bricks inside each ice chest, the
Coast Guard said in a statement without indicating the street value
of the drugs.
   It said the recovery was made by the Coast Guard cutter Attu
during a patrol. Officials searched beaches in Vieques for more
cocaine but found none, it said.
   The statement said so far this year the Coast Guard has seized
7,548 pounds of cocaine in waters off Puerto Rico.

   Increased chemical attacks on pockets of
crop-threatening Mediterranean fruit flies are drawing fire from
politicians and environmentalists citing potential health risks.
   Discovery of a fertilized Medfly in a previously unaffected San
Fernando Valley suburb prompted agriculture officials to schedule
aerial pesticide spraying over the infested 12-square-block area
next Monday.
   Spraying with the pesticide malathion also was planned Thursday
night for a 22-square-mile swath of East Los Angeles and the San
Gabriel Valley, with a second application over the same area
scheduled in two weeks.
   City Councilman Richard Alatorre, who represents an infested
district, wrote a letter to state Food and Agricultural Director
Henry Voss, stating fears about the pesticide.
   ``Clearly, the Mediterranean fruit fly is a serious menace to
the welfare of this region and ultimately the state,'' Alatorre
wrote. ``It is equally clear, however, that one of the weapons used
in the battle to eradicate this menace, malathion, is itself of
questionable safety to the health of humans exposed to it.''
   A protest was planned Monday by the Green Party, a political
group that stresses environmental issues.
   ``The Greens intend to put pressure on public officials to
outright ban the use of malathion,'' said party chairman Randall
Toler. The group is calling for the use of sterile Medflies instead
of pesticides to battle the infestation, he said.
   Toler said agriculture officials ``were caught flat-footed
without adequate supplies of sterile Medflies.'' He said the
cancer-causing potential of malathion remains under review by the
federal government.
   The sterile flies were normally released after sprayings to
breed any remaining pests out of existence.
   A county official and a spokesman for Gov. George Deukmejian
defended malathion's use against the Medfly, which lays its eggs in
more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables, threatening the
state's $14-billion-a-year agriculture industry.
   ``We feel strongly that the doses that are sprayed are not going
to cause any health problems,'' said Carol Ward, spokeswoman for
the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. She said less
than an ounce of malathion is spayed per acre.
   Governor George Deukmejian ``fully supports'' current efforts
and ``believes that the public is supportive because of the clear
damage that the Medfly can bring to California's top industry,''
said his spokesman, Kevin M. Brett.

   Most of the 1,000 residents of this southwest
Missouri town were evacuated Thursday night as firemen battled a
propane fire that sent flames shooting 70 feet into the air.
   No one was hurt in the fire, which erupted at 10:30 a.m. as a
work crew was performing routine maintenance on a submersible pump,
said Jim Gipson, a spokesman for Williams Pipeline Co.
   Propane from an underground cavern escaped and somehow ignited
when it reached the surface, he said. A huge, orange fireball lit
up the sky; the glow from the fire was visible from at least 25
miles away.
   The fire was under control at 9 p.m., company president Steve
Cropper said.
   ``The pipeline facilities have been shut down, all the terminal
and loading facilities have been shut down,'' Cropper said.
   Jasper residents were asked to go to evacuation points in nearby
Carthage and Lamar, and Williams was busing some people to hotels
in Joplin. People were told to expect to be out of their homes all
night.
   ``We're letting the leaking propane burn,'' said Gipson, who was
at company headquarters in Tulsa, Okla. ``It's just making a big
light.''
   Authorities closed a rail line that moves near the pipeline
station as well as part of U.S. 71, which runs north and south
through Jasper. Warnings were issued to aircraft not to fly near
the area.

<TEXT>
   The violent series of tornadoes that
hit the eastern United States Thursday crashed into Quebec just
after noon, leaving one person dead, police said.
   The tornado first touched down in the town of Richmond, just
east of St. Hilaire, police said. A man was killed when his car was
hit by a school bus during the high winds in Richmond, Quebec
provincial police official Bertrand Fortin said.
   The victim's name has not been released, said Fortin. None of
the children in the bus were injured.
   Winds of more than 124 mph blew the roof off a shopping mall in
the center of St. Hilaire. The back wall of an office building
behind the mall was demolished before the tornado moved down the
main street, shattering windows and knocking down trees.
   Roofs were torn off buildings, cars were overturned and
mailboxes were thrown hundreds of yards, said a town official in
the small community southeast of Montreal.
   ``The tornado went through like a flash _ maybe 30 seconds _ but
the winds kept up for over an hour,'' said Jeanine Lapalme,
secretary to the mayor.
   There were no deaths reported in St. Hilaire, but a small number
of people were injured in the storm and were taken to hospital in
neighboring communities, said Lapalme.

   The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a final
appeal from a man who was slated to be executed at 12:01 a.m.
Friday for raping and murdering his cousin while on an 8-hour pass
from a prison work-release center in 1978.
   The high court refused by a 7-2 vote late Thursday afternoon to
spare the life of Arthur James Julius. Justices William J. Brennan
and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose capital punishment in all
circumstances, supported Julius' emergency plea for a stay of
execution.
   Julius, 43, was condemned to die in the electric chair at Holman
Prison for raping and strangling his cousin, 29-year-old Susie Bell
Sanders, at her Montgomery home. He was serving a life term for a
1972 murder at the time of the violent sexual assault.
   Defense attorney Tommy Goggans of Montgomery argued in
last-ditch attempts to halt the execution that the prosecution
withheld evidence during Julius' trial in Montgomery. But a federal
district judge and a federal appeals court rejected the plea before
Goggans took it to the Supreme Court.
   In January, Julius received a stay of execution less than 48
hours before he was scheduled to die in the electric chair. On that
occasion, Gov. Guy Hunt denied clemency pleas, saying he would not
interfere with the verdict of the judicial system.
   According to court records, Julius left on an 8-hour pass from
Draper prison's work-release center at 11 a.m. on Jan. 29, 1978,
and borrowed a relative's car from 3:30 p.m. to 6:25 p.m. During
that time, according to court records, Julius turned Ms. Sanders'
apartment into a shambles, beating her and dragging her though
rooms and subjecting her to ``grotesque sexual abuse'' before
strangling her.
   Her nude body was discovered by her 5-year-old daughter.
   The victim's parents told reporters in January that the
execution was long overdue. Her father has since died. Family
members declined comment when contacted by phone this week.
   The last person executed in Alabama was Herbert Lee Richardson,
who was put to death Aug. 18 for the pipebomb slaying of a Dothan
child. His was the sixth execution in the state since the U.S.
Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1972.

   U.S. clergy decried the murder of six Jesuit priests in El
Salvador as an unspeakable atrocity, with the National Council of
Churches urging Congress to halt delivery of military aid to El
Salvador.
   ``We fear for the lives of our brothers,'' said the Rev. Joseph
Berra, a fellow member of the Roman Catholic order who knew the
victims and worked in San Salvador before moving to Texas in August.
   The Bush administration, readying a new shipment of arms to
confront a rebel offensive, said it will press for an
investigation, and congressmen are threatening cuts in military aid
unless the murderers are brought to justice.
   ``If the government does not bring to justice those responsible,
we would have no choice but to try to severely limit Salvadoran aid
next year,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over foreign aid.

   An outside counsel will investigate five
senators who intervened with banking regulators to help a political
contributor, a source says, indicating an intensified probe by the
Senate Ethics Committee.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity Thursday, did not
say whether a counsel had yet been hired to investigate the
senators, who aided Charles H. Keating Jr. when he was the chairman
of the failing Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.
   But The New York Times reported today the committee had decided
to hire prominent Washington attorney Robert S. Bennett for the
investigation, as well as for an unrelated review involving Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. A source says the Senate Ethics Committee
is reviewing allegations that D'Amato violated rules in the
Department of Housing and Urban Development scandal.
   Until now, the Ethics Committee's only known interest was a
letter asking the five whether Keating's contributions _ $1.3
million to the senators' campaigns or political causes _ prompted
them to question regulators about their examination of Lincoln.
   The senators are Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; John McCain, R-Ariz., and Donald
Riegle, D-Mich. Cranston responded to the committee Thursday as
DeConcini and Riegle did earlier, all denying any improprieties.
Glenn and McCain have not yet filed formal responses but have
denied wrongdoing.

   East Germany's premier today asked parliament
to approve a new Cabinet that would give more than a third of the
posts to non-Communists but allow the party to maintain control of
the government.
   Premier Hans Modrow also called for patience and energetic
efforts to rescue the nation from its economic troubles.
   ``We must have unwavering political and ideological tolerance,''
he said, apparently referring to Western appeals for East Germany
to accept some capitalist reforms.
   Parliamentary Speaker Guenther Maleuda opened the two-day
session by reading the agenda, which included a vote to approve the
new Cabinet lined up by Modrow on Thursday.

   The Soviet Union is nearing final passage of
historic legislation establishing the right to travel, but U.S.
trade barriers will give way only gradually.
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said Thursday the Soviet
travel legislation will not lead to an immediate dismantling of
tariffs erected by Congress 15 years ago in behalf of Soviet Jews.
   He said the Soviets, at best, would get only a year-to-year
waiver while restrictions on trade credits would remain in place.
   ``We'll review it to see if it is sufficient,'' Mosbacher said
of the Soviet legislation that is expected to clear its final
hurdle by December. ``We can't prejudge that.''

   More than half of the criminal suspects in many
of the nation's big cities had used cocaine within a few days of
their arrests, a federal study shows.
   The study indicated that three-quarters of the criminals in New
York and Philadelphia, and 65 percent of those in Washington, D.C.,
use cocaine.
   One official said it showed that ``the real drug problem'' is in
the nation's criminal sector.
   ``We could find the large bulk of drug users by looking at the
13 million arrests made each year,'' said Eric Wish of the National
Institute of Justice, an arm of the Justice Department that
conducted the survey.

   Former President Reagan is under orders to
turn over documents by Wednesday to John Poindexter, who says his
alleged crimes in the Iran-Contra affair were authorized by the
president.
   In an order issued Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Harold
Greene said Poindexter ``may serve upon former President Reagan and
upon the archivist of the United States the subpoenas ... submitted
to the court.''
   The archivist has possession of presidential records of the
Reagan administration. Reagan took his diary with him when he left
the White House.
   Greene's ruling marks the first time in the Iran-Contra scandal
that a judge has approved a subpoena for documents from Reagan.

<HEAD>Soviet Patients Try to Cope with Shortage of Medicines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For all of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, the
Soviet health system, with its ossified bureaucracy, confused new
directives, backward industry and lack of funds, remains unable to
fill an array of health needs.
   This was evident recently at a gathering of 10 core members of
the newly formed Moscow Diabetes Association.
   One member, Larisa Krupinyova, said a specialist had recommended
that her diabetic son, Roman, be given a high-quality insulin.
   ``I said, `Fine, where do I get it?''' she told the group. ``She
told me, `That's your problem.'''
   Around the small circle, heads nodded in empathy.
   Elvira Gustova, mother of a 15-year-old diabetic, said that in
five years she has been able to buy only 50 strips used for the
blood-sugar tests that are supposed to be taken daily.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, reported recently that
President Gorbachev had told a meeting of the party's ruling
Politburo the medicine shortage was so severe it had become a
political problem that should be taken under ``tough party
control.''
   He had previously denounced what he called the mismanagement
that fuels shortages of pharmaceuticals and equipment. He also
singled out by name the officials he said ordered millions of
disposable syringes without ensuring there would be needles to go
with them. Babies and children in several Soviet hospitals have
contracted AIDS from unsterilized needles.
   The government recently pledged an additional $781 million to
buy imported medications. In all, the Soviet Union expects to spend
about $3.2 billion from its precious hard-currency reserves to
import medicines this year, but Pravda said the situation still is
not improving.
   Speakers at the Politburo meeting blamed the Soviet
pharamaceutical industry for the shortage, as well as the refusal
of several localities to allow new chemical factories to be built
within them.
   Alexei Moskvichev, head of Moscow's health services, estimated
that only 400 of the 2,800 permissable medications are in short
supply in the Soviet Union and said he knew of no deaths brought on
by the lack of a particular medication.
   ``If I knew it was needed, it would be obtained somehow, whether
by plane from Europe or otherwise,'' he said in an interview.
   But the Soviet press imparts a bleaker picture.
   A recent article headlined ``Why are children dying?'' in the
newspaper Sovietskaya Kultura described how the lack of proper
medicine in Soviet drugstores led to a rise in infant mortality.
   The government newspaper Izevstia advised in a headline,
``You're sick? Breathe deeper!''
   The labor newspaper Trud titled a story ``The shortage that
costs lives.''
   ``We can get along without meat and sausage,'' retiree S.
Katayev wrote in a letter to Pravda. ``And we can even live with
just 1.5 kilograms (3 pounds) of sugar a month _ we won't die from
that. But we can't get along without medical help.''
   The longest line at the biggest pharmacy in the Soviet Union
leads to the information booth where people try to find out where
they can get the medicine they need _ if they can get it at all.
   On a recent afternoon in Pharmacy No. 1, Anfisa Kremlyova, a
retired doctor, came away from the information window empty-handed.
She had been told no drugstore in the district had the
anti-coagulant or sedative she needed. ``I'll just have to search
some more,'' she said.
   ``Sometimes there are scenes,'' said Tamara Pogromova, assistant
director of the pharmacy a short walk from Red Square. ``After all,
people have to get cured.''
   This past spring, recalled Rima Goffman, whose grandson has
diabetes, there was an insulin panic, and calls started pouring in
saying supplies of top-grade imported insulin were getting
dangerously low.
   Members of the Moscow Diabetes Association appealed to Moscow's
Communist Party committee. The party chiefs pressured the Health
Ministry, and within two weeks supplies improved.
   That was a battle won, ``but it cost health and tears and
nerves,'' Goffman said.
   In some ways, things are better now. If not for Gorbachev's
reforms, the Moscow Diabetes Association would never have been
allowed to form, gain official recognition and push its own
interests.
   But the Gorbachev years have also witnessed a drop in reserves
of hard currency and dwindling supplies of everything from soap to
socks, with medicine increasingly hard to get, especially imported
medicine.
   Diabetes Association members took turns telling tales of woe for
more than two hours at their meeting.
   They complained that there are virtually no blood-sugar
measuring devices in Soviet hospitals; that there is a shortage of
specialists and most of those who do practice are poorly trained;
that it is difficult to get the kinds of food diabetics need; that
when diabetics are hospitalized, they often get hepatitis from
contaminated needles or suffer more due to the poor diet.
   Igor Rivkin, whose son has diabetes, said Gorbachev's reforms
eventually may improve conditions, ``but the problems are so deep
they can't be solved right away. And you can't conserve the patient
until they improve. Every day, every hour, the disease does its
work.''

<BYLINE>Art Deco Expert to Auction Private Collection ^By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 400 Art Deco furnishings and objects from
one of the world's largest private collections go to the auction
block next month in what experts are calling the sale of the season.
   The collection, estimated at about $10 million includes a pair
of gilded bronze fire dogs sculpted by Gustav Miklos, 14 lacquer
panels by Jean Dunand and 66 pieces of furniture crafted by master
cabinetmaker Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann.
   ``There is no collection like this in private hands anywhere in
the world,'' said auctioneer Jacques Tajan, who is to hold the
gavel on Dec. 13 at the Hotel Georges V. The objects can be
previewed Nov. 27-30 at the Theatre des Champs Elysees.
   The collection was assembled over 25 years by Alain Lesieutre, a
59-year-old former dealer who admits he'd rather buy than sell.
   Lesieutre said parting with his treasures _ among the world's
rarest and most beautiful objects from the 1930s _ is not easy.
   ``Yes, it's a heartbreak to see my house emptied of all these
things,'' he said in an interview at his Left Bank apartment, which
looks more like a museum than a private home. ``But it's a chance
for me to pursue my other passions, which are collecting paintings
from 1890 to 1950.''
   Lesieurtre was among the first French collectors to appreciate
Art Deco. In his ``The Spirit and Splendour of Art Deco,''
published by Paddington Press Ltd., he described the style as ``the
last attempt made in Europe to create a full-blooded, perfectly
coherent decorative style, with its own completeness, its own
internal logic and its own dream.''
   ``I love the quality of the materials and the purity of the
lines,'' he said. ``At its best, the furniture has the clean,
simple grace of the Louis XVI style, without the fussiness.''
   The collection includes a one-of-a-kind coiffeuse and a roll-top
desk in Makassar ebony bordered wtih ivory inlay, both by Ruhlmann.
   Art Deco aficionados will love the gold jewelry by surrealist
artist Max Ernst, glassware by Galle and Daum, drop necklaces by
Lalique and bell-shaped Tiffany lamps.
   Art Deco designers were way ahead of their times. The design of
Lesieutre's egg-shaped chairs by Carlo Bugatti was a forerunner of
forms that came of age in the 1960s.
   Art Deco reached its culmination in the 1925 Exposition des Arts
Decoratifs, scheduled originally to take place in 1914 and called
off because of World War I. The show also gave the style its name.
   The delay gave Art Deco time to mature and prosper. Ebony,
ivory, shagreen (rawhide), leather, lacquer, enamel were the
preferred materials of Art Deco artists and craftsmen who tried to
get rid of the gilded ``prettiness'' of earlier styles as they
sought a more massive opulence with a clean-cut simplicity.
   Lesieutre admits that he may never get over his passion for Art
Deco.
   ``I'm putting my gorgeous Ruhlmann card table in the sale, but
since I'm a gin fanatic, I need another card table. What did I buy?
Another Ruhlmann!'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The riots on St. Croix that followed Hurricane
Hugo, and the racial unrest that threatens this city today, grew
from centuries-old seeds sown in a paradoxical region, as detailed
in James A. Michener's latest novel, ``Caribbean.''
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning author spent three years traveling
among the ``chain of lovely jewels'' and researched more than 400
books to put together a 667-page novel that chronicles more than
six centuries of civilization and destruction in the region.
   ``The idyllic portrait is only partly true,'' said Michener, 82,
as he and his wife, Mari, prepared to set sail on a farewell cruise
to the islands he described in his book.
   ``There were undoubtedly fine black-white relationships and many
were friendly ... and yet each one of the islands had eight or 10
insurrections,'' he said. ``There's a dichotomy there that I think
we all are engaged in.''
   Michener explores the contradictions of the region using his
patented blend of fact and fiction. Historical figures such as
Christopher Columbus, Adm. Horatio Nelson, Fidel Castro and Gen.
Toussaint L'Ouverture, who outfoxed French, Spanish and British
armies in what is now Haiti, brush against imaginary characters
that range from a Mayan priestess to a Jamaican Rasta.
   How the Caribbean islands can be so beautiful and yet so violent
is the central question of the book. In scene after scene, men and
women of ambition build dreams, only to be crushed by tyrants.
   ``In the short run, brutality always wins; it takes longer for
amity to prevail,'' he writes after describing how the Carib
Indians cannibalized the primitive Arawaks, who as the islands'
first residents were satisfied with planting vegetables and
watching the sun set each day.
   The message resonates throughout the island's history,
demonstrating how the legacy of harsh colonial rule provides both a
charm and a curse for the islands of today. Michener draws clear
lines from the slave rebellions to contemporary scenes in which
poverty-stricken blacks prey on tourists, even though the visitors
provide desperately needed cash to their island economies.
   ``The history of this land, and of all the islands Spain has
captured in this lovely sea, will involve the slow and even
reluctant admission that the big black man down there has a soul,''
says a rather forward-looking 16th century priest of Michener's
invention, ruminating on the atrocities Columbus ordered against
Indians, and the oppression his descendents would force on slaves.
   Michener, a lifelong Quaker, says he grew to love and fear for
the people of the islands during his research, which brought him to
back streets and poorer areas American tourists rarely see on their
Caribbean vacations.
   ``I see people beating their brains out to figure out what
they're going to do for money,'' said Michener, who has several
characters suggest all the islands would prosper if the United
States inflated the price of Caribbean cane sugar.
   But because the U.S. sugar industry won't allow it, the region
is headed for revolution, or worse, according to a Haitian-American
professor who flees her island as a child and returns the same way
Michener did this week, as a guest lecturer on a cruise ship.
   ``So we stagger along toward a disaster whose timing we cannot
predict, but whose coming is inevitable. We're a fleet of
magnificent islands, lost in the sun,'' she says in the book.
   Michener also examines Miami, the destination of refugees from
every wave of unrest in the area, through the eyes of a
Cuban-American doctor trying to reconcile his two cultures.
   The doctor admits that he and other white Cubans secretly
despise the Cubans who came to Florida later in the 1980 Mariel
boatlift, because many of the newcomers are black. And yet he
despairs when his white, non-Latin friends suffer ``Hispanic
Panic'' and flee to Palm Beach.
   Michener, who traveled to Havana in search of a sugar plantation
to describe in ``Caribbean,'' and co-wrote ``Six Days in Havana''
as a spin-off of the larger novel, also sends the doctor to Havana
on a mission from President Reagan to discuss normalizing relations
between the United States and Cuba.
   The issue is considered incendiary in South Florida's Cuban
exile community, but Michener's feelings are clear:
   ``Miami, perched at the tip of a great continent, striving to
retain its Anglo-Saxon character, and Havana, located on the edge
of a glorious island and determined to protect its Spanish
heritage. ... They should have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship of
mutual reward.''
   He blames the Castro revolution for making intercourse between
the two natural neighbors impossible, ``to the grave detriment of
each.''
   Michener has published 36 books since winning the 1947 Pulitzer
Prize for ``Tales of the South Pacific.'' And despite a quintuple
coronary bypass operation in 1986 and a hip replacement the next
year, he plans to keep working, as a ``Professor Emeritus
Emeritus'' at the University of Texas.
   ``I'm feeling good. I'm a little unsteady on my pins, but I take
a long walk every night,'' said Michener, who swears he hasn't
decided what the subject of his next book will be.
   ``It will probably be a novel, all fiction. It's a pretty big
decision to jump into another book, another state, another society,
another set of problems and contradictions. It's really quite
complicated.''

<TEXT>
   It's been more than two years since Garrison
Keillor left gentle Lake Wobegon, but public radio's favorite
storyteller says he's not worried about stepping up to the
microphone again, even if the stage is in rough-and-tumble Brooklyn.
   ``I hope to become nervous, you know, at the right time. I count
on it,'' said Keillor, who returns to the airwaves this month on a
new weekly program. ``But I hope that it doesn't raise the pitch in
my voice. I think I'm counted on to sing bass parts.''
   ``Garrison Keillor's American Radio Company of the Air,'' which
premieres on public radio stations Nov. 25, will once again feature
Keillor's soft voice _ ``I'm going to sing just ever so slightly
less than people would like me to.''
   But he insists the new, live show will not be a continuation or
spinoff of ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' which attracted 4 million
listeners each week on American Public Radio.
   ``What I'm doing is taking 13 years of experience doing one kind
of live radio variety show in one place and I'm using that to
create a different one, a different one in a different place,'' he
said in a recent interview, sitting behind a desk stacked with
books at his Manhattan office.
   Keillor's plans for this season's 20 shows include ``classic
American music of all kinds'' _ from Aaron Copland to Duke
Ellington, country music to Broadway. Singer Eileen Farrell,
pianist James Tocco and opera star Marilyn Horne are scheduled to
guest star.
   And the humorist says his monologues will return, but with less
of a focus on the Midwest.
   ``I've a lot of things I want to talk about, some of which have
to do about New York, or take place here,'' he said. ``But I don't
have any need to do a routine on New York ... tell New York jokes.''
   Will he be telling tales again about the Norwegian bachelor
farmers and other residents of the mythical Minnesota town of Lake
Wobegon?
   ``I don't believe I will,'' he says with a smile. ``Unless of
course I heard something, I would pass it on.''
   Keillor, 47, left his home base of St. Paul, Minn., with his
wife for Denmark in 1987 and settled in Manhattan later that same
year.
   Since then, he has done occasional specials for cable
television, appeared on tour with orchestras and continued to spin
yarns about the town he made famous on the earlier show and in such
best-sellers as ``Lake Wobegon Days'' and ``Leaving Home.''
   Keillor's return to radio was sparked, he says, by an elderly
Georgia man he met during a trip last year to Gettysburg, Pa.
   ``He said, `When are you coming back?' And that was the first
time anybody had asked me that question, `When are you coming
back?' not, `Are you ...' or, `Why don't you ...'
   ``He just said, `When are you coming back?' I said, `Pretty
soon.'''
   He also received encouragement from his wife, Ulla Skaerved, a
career counselor. ``She's a professional in this field of advising
middle-aged men on their career plans,'' he said.
   After discussions with Minnesota Public Radio, which also
produced ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' Keillor announced plans for
his return in May.
   He put together his company this summer after scores of
auditions where he made a point of not looking at the performers.
   ``I wanted to find radio actors who can also sing,'' he said.
``And I really was bowled over by the people who I got.''
   The Brooklyn Academy of Music will house the show, except for
two weeks next year when it travels to St. Paul.
   The urban neighborhood where the Academy is located is a far cry
from mild-mannered St. Paul, and Keillor expects the house to be
filled with ``a lot of people from Connecticut and New Jersey who
will be uneasy ... thinking about the fact when the show's over,
it'll be dark.''
   But, he says, ``We'll reassure them. They'll be brave when they
leave.''
   As for his friends back home, he suggests they wait until he's
able to put them up for the weekend before they come out to see the
show.
   ``They don't even want to know what hotel rates are, people from
Lake Wobegon,'' he said. ``I don't think they should even look into
it.''

<HEAD>Puerto Ricans Clash Over Trees at Famed El Morro Castle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   El Morro Castle, the fortress
Spaniards built 400 years ago to keep out pirates and now a major
tourist attraction, has become a battleground for tree lovers and
those who demand historical authenticity.
   In the tree-lovers camp are conservationists and a group of art
students protesting what they call the ``chainsaw massacre'' of El
Morro's trees by the National Guard after Hurricane Hugo struck on
Sept. 18. All 200 trees on the 21-acre site, not just those damaged
by the storm, were chopped up and hauled away, leaving a litter of
stumps.
   In the opposing camp are the National Park Service and Puerto
Rico's Commonwealth Historic Preservation Office. They control
separate areas of El Morro andauthorized the clearance as part of
their plan to restore the site to its original state _ a treeless
garrison.
   About 100 students at the School of Plastic Arts, which is on El
Morro grounds, planted saplings and protest placards outside the
school and have been maintaining an around-the-clock vigil there
since early October.
   The students, who once did their artwork in the shade of the
trees, have organized protest marches to the governor's mansion, La
Fortaleza, demanding reforestation of El Morro.
   Conservation groups have taken up the cause, which has provoked
a stream of letters in The San Juan Star, including one containing
Joyce Kilmer's most famous poem, ``Trees.''
   W.P. Crawford, the National Park Service superintendent in
Puerto Rico, said Hugo's 140-mph winds left only few trees standing
at El Morro and most of the rest were too badly mangled to be saved.
   Taking them out was only thing to do, he maintained.
   Besides, Crawford said, a 1983 general management plan, approved
two years later by the U.S. and Commonwealth governments, said the
broad grassy slope leading to the fort should be treeless, the way
it was originally.
   ``Maybe with a superhuman effort some of the trees could have
been saved,'' he said. ``But because the general management plan
calls for removing all the trees, I didn't think it was worth the
time and effort of nursing a dozen or so along.''
   ``What we are trying to do is protect the historic scene,'' as
mandated by Congress for all U.S. historic sites, Crawford said.
``The historical context has got to be No. 1 by law.''
   Archaeologist Guy Pantell, who has asked the presidential
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in Washington for an
investigation, said the historical argument did not justify the
destruction of trees not damaged by the storm.
   ``If this was so, parts of El Morro would have to be eliminated.
Its construction occurred during several centuries,'' Pantell said
in an interview with the Star.
   The walled fort, which overlooks San Juan Harbor, was built
mostly between 1589 and the 1650s to guard the city against
seaborne attack. Today, it is by far Puerto Rico's most popular
tourist attraction, with 2.5 million visitors a year.
   Tourists approach El Morro's tiered batteries across a 200-yard
esplanade, which is a popular place for picnics and flying kites.
Historians say the esplanade was purposely kept clear of vegetation
to give El Morro's defenders a clear line of fire.
   But during the 1940s, soldiers planted about 50 sea pines and
coconut palms along the road in front of El Morro, which at that
time had a U.S. Army officers' club. Other trees were planted
nearby on land controlled by the Commonwealth government.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, who had endorsed the tree removal,
has reversed his position and appointed a committee to work out a
compromise.
   Committee member Enrique Marti, founder of the conservation
group Pro Bosques Urbanos, or Pro Urban Forests, said the panel had
agreed to selectively plant trees at El Morro to keep the main
esplanade clear. He said the landscape would look better than it
did before the hurricane.
   But not everybody is satisfied.
   ``Our children will see the trees, but we won't,'' said Lourdes
Quintero, 24, one of the protesting art students.

<HEAD>Maria McKee Almost Quit Before Debut Solo Album</HEAD>

   This may be a shock to anyone
who's heard her soaring voice, but singer Maria McKee nearly quit
the business just before recording her solo debut album.
   ``I went through a lot of soul-searching before doing this
album,'' said the 25-year-old McKee. ``I had moments when I
thought, `Is this worth it?' I had moments of sheer desolation
about it.''
   The depression stemmed from her experiences fronting Lone
Justice, a highly touted country-rock band from Los Angeles that
fell far short of expectations.
   Plucked from the garages in time to put out a record in 1985,
Lone Justice found friends in high places: Jimmy Iovine, who
produced John Lennon, sat behind the controls for them; Tom Petty
gave them a song; U2 invited them on tour. But neither of Lone
Justice's two records sold very well, and the supposed can't-miss
stars missed.
   The experience scarred McKee, but didn't fatally wound her. Her
solo debut, an amalgam of rock, country and gospel filled with
messages from the lovelorn, isn't setting any sales records,
either, but it's been received with the kind of quiet respect for
which McKee is longing.
   ``Ever since I was a little kid I wanted to have a rock 'n' roll
band, to put a band together and be successful at it,'' she said.
``I had to let that go and realize that it wasn't going to happen.
I was beginning to wonder if I really wanted to make music.''
   Like many rockers before her, Lone Justice was disillusioned by
the realization that the pop music merry-go-round was controlling
them, instead of the other way around.
   There was no way Lone Justice could live up to the advance
billing, she said.
   ``The hype was so completely absurd, without really the
substance to back it up and that's very dangerous,'' she said.
``Even if you are as great as everyone expects you to be it can
never really work out because people like to discover for
themselves something to like about your music.''
   She blamed the band's failure on the usual litany of rock 'n'
roll excuses: bad chemistry between band members, business naivete
and a sense they were writing songs to fulfill the expectations of
others instead of themselves.
   McKee took some time off, the band dispersed to various parts of
the country, but they didn't immediately learn their lessons. Lone
Justice actually regrouped and started work on a third album before
McKee decided to pack it in.
   The solo record is largely a collaboration with keyboardist
Bruce Brody and producer Mitchell Froom, with several session
players added. The sound is more sophisticated and airy than the
Lone Justice records, highlighting McKee's extraordinary voice.
   ``I wanted to have the freedom to write whatever I wanted to, to
record with whoever I wanted to,'' she said. ``It could be an
acoustic band, it could be a jug band, it could be a string band.
Maybe I took liberties that I'm too young to take or too
inexperienced to take, but I thought I should be honest with
myself.''
   Although the album sounds like it's coming from a woman whose
heart has been broken a few times, McKee insists that isn't the
case.
   Love is used as a metaphor for some of her career uncertainties
during the song ``I've Forgotten What It Was in You (That Put the
Need in Me).''
   ``I'm not really experienced in the art of love and all of
that,'' she said. ``I'm sort of an idiot savant when it comes to
love. I've been on the road since I was 18 and I haven't really had
any boyfriends.''
   On compact disc, the downer spell of her album is broken by the
last song, ``Drinkin' in My Sunday Dress.'' The twisted tale of a
hard drinking yet church-going woman features some of McKee's most
uninhibited vocals, and a wild guitar that Marc Ribot plays with
his car keys.
   McKee said the song was left off the album because it didn't
really fit the theme, but it's a highlight of her live shows. She
opened a series of dates for Neil Young this summer accompanied by
Brody and her acoustic guitar, singing no Lone Justice songs.
   Although Geffen Records was initially concerned that her album
didn't have a natural single, McKee said she's not that worried
about having hits. A career role model for her now is Elvis
Costello, she said.
   ``I really admire the way he's gone about it,'' she said. ``He
makes album after album and some are better than others, but he's
always onto something. He's always on the edge and always
experimenting with n and new musicians and stretching his writing.
it.''
   After a few tours with Lone Justice s really didn't believe,
she's recaptured the sp music business in the first place.
   McKee'salfway through her 20s.
   ``I'm 25 years old and even though I've been doing this for 10
years, there was soof that time that was spent trying to figure out
what I wanted to do,'' she said. ``Now that I know, I'm on the
right track again.''

<HEAD>Ivory Trade Ban Bad News for Hong Kong Carvers</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CINTY LI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seated in his workshop where he has
meticulously transformed elephant tusks into intricate ivory
artwork for four decades, Wong Cheong-lam knows the days of his
craft are numbered.
   ``I'm the only one left,'' he sighs, looking around the the
workshop where six carvers once worked.
   The artwork crafted by the 55-year-old Wong and the 1,200 or so
other ivory carvers in Hong Kong has long been popular.
   Wholesalers from the United States, Europe and Japan have
eagerly snapped up tons of ivory worked in Hong Kong. Shop windows
in tourist districts display works ranging from panormaic
landscapes carved from an entire tusk to delicate earrings.
   But now the centuries-old craft may be doomed.
   In Octber, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES) adopted a ban on world ivory trading to save
Africa's dwindling elephant population, which has dropped from 1.5
million in the 1970s to an estimated 600,000 now _ victims of
poachers after their tusks.
   The ban gives ivory traders until Jan. 18 to sell their stocks.
But Hong Kong companies say they will need much longer to sell 670
tons of ivory, the world's largest known stockpile, worth about
$128 million.
   Wong estimates the value of his own uncarved ivory at about
$25,600 and said he has no idea what to do. ``It'll take at least
five years to carve it all.''
   Local traders are lobbying the government in this British colony
to allow them to continue sales past the January deadline and are
scrambling to figure out how to save their industry.
   ``Between the elephants and the carvers, who do you think should
be protected?'' asked an angry Dominic Ng, a leading ivory trader.
   Ng suggests the government forbid the import of more tusks but
allow the carving and export of the existing stockpile until the
ban is reviewed in 1991 by CITES.
   But since the United States, Japan and other major ivory import
markets are upholding the ban, it is not clear how much such a
policy would help the industry in Hong Kong. The only legal market
for traders would be smaller countries that do not belong to CITES
or refuse to go along with the ban.
   The Hong Kong government has indicated it will abide by the
trade ban, and officials are considering vocational training for
carvers thrown out of work.
   But Wong is skeptical about retraining workers.
   ``Ivory carvers usually do not have much education,'' he said.
``It is too late for them to learn another skill and doing other
odd jobs will barely make ends meet.''
   The government also has promised to seek support for the
creation of an international fund to buy up the ivory stockpile in
Hong Kong.
   Local traders are demanding compensation for their stockpile,
which they say consists of ivory that was purchased with approval
by CITES before it imposed the ban.
   A government survey found 93 percent of the ivory in Hong Kong
contains valid CITES certification, but conservationists argue much
of the stockpile comes from the tusks of poached elephants that the
convention has nonetheless allowed onto the market.
   Nicholas Pirie, chairman of the local branch of the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, says the Hong
Kong ivory must be destroyed.
   If ivory exports were permitted to continue, it would be easy
for more poached ivory to be smuggled into the colony and claimed
as part of the original stockpile, Pirie argues.
   ``I sympathize with the workers but I don't sympathize with the
bosses,'' he said.
   At his workshop, in an old residential building, Wong
methodically works on a six-inch-high elephant figure, using a tiny
drill to carve wrinkles in the animal's feet. The project will take
up to three weeks.
   Such craftsmanship has been an integral part of Chinese art for
centuries. But Wong believes the long history of ivory carving in
Hong Kong, now the main center for such work, is reaching an end
with or without the ban.
   ``Who wants to learn how to carve ivory nowadays?'' he said,
explaining it takes five years of apprenticeship and pays only
about $500 a month.

<HEAD>Bronze John F. Kennedy Statue Ready for Casting</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhotos by Elise Amendola</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sculptor Isabel McIlvain is closing in on the
moment of truth for her 8-foot-tall portrayal of John F. Kennedy.
   Her clay statue is about to be cast in bronze, the final step
before its unveiling outside the Massachusetts capitol as the
formal memorial to a beloved native son.
   For older generations, the heroic image will recall the optimism
and vigor embodied by Kennedy. For generations born since the young
president was slain on Nov. 22, 1963, the statue offers a glimpse
of the era known as Camelot.
   ``My wish is to portray somebody who was a magnetic leader and
who had a lot of youth, a lot of hope about his role and the
possiblities for America,'' said McIlvain, a professor of sculpture
at Boston University.
   McIlvain's work, which will take about six months to cast,
depicts Kennedy in a classic pose _ striding into a breeze, eyes
forward, elbows bent with his left hand tucked into his suit pocket.
   ``There are some people who have the carriage but they are stiff
and pompous, where there's nothing stiff about Kennedy,'' said the
artist, who has spent thousands of hours studying her subject. ``I
think you can see the man's wit, the glint of humor in his eye.''
   The finished $175,000 sculpture, which has been paid for through
donations from citizens' groups and schoolchildren, is scheduled
for unveiling May 29, which would have been Kennedy's 72nd birthday.
   It will be displayed outside the Statehouse near a statue of
Henry Cabot Lodge, the Republican whose son Kennedy defeated in
1952 in the U.S. Senate campaign that launched his national career.
   The John F. Kennedy Memorial Commission was established by the
state Legislature in 1983 to create a suitable tribute. The
commission sponsored a yearlong competition for memorial designs,
which drew 300 entries from around the country.
   Judges debated the former president's stance, demeanor and
whether both coat buttons should be buttoned the way Kennedy
preferred, despite the dicates of style.
   History _ and McIlvain _ won after it was established Kennedy
had indeed appeared in more than 200 photographs with his
two-button coat buttoned contrary to sartorial custom.
   ``I tried to catch his spirit, so it's not my thinking imposed
on him as much as it's a reflection of him,'' said McIlvain, who
won the commission's approval in April 1988.
   ``He was an extremely charming man, but I didn't want the
super-polished, stereotypical person,'' she added, citing again the
hand in the pocket. ``I'm sure his mother told him endlessly not to
do it because it sags the pocket out, but that's the real John
Kennedy.''

   Smirnoff vodka will be pitching a literacy
campaign rather than bottles of booze this Christmas.
   Tobacco, beer and consumer products giant Philip Morris
Companies Inc. is spending $60 million on ads celebrating the Bill
of Rights.
   Burger King Corp. dumped its regular fast-food ads over the past
month and aired commercials appealing for money for disaster relief
efforts.
   What's going on here? Have these companies lost their heads _
shucking the pursuit of profit in an altruistic frenzy, egged on by
President Bush's vision of a kinder and gentler society?
   Or have they discovered there is prestige to be gained,
attention to be grabbed and money to be made by linking their names
to fashionable causes?
   The answer may lie somewhere in between, although some marketing
experts warn that trying to use altruism as a screen for
bottom-line objectives risks a consumer backlash.
   ``There is a limit to how much you can wrap yourself in the
flag,'' said Mike Hughes, vice chairman and creative director at
the Marhat other liquor brands
have used in their Christmas ads. He said backing a cause also
would appeal to Smirnoff drinkers' ``traditional values.''
   Smirnoff is contributing $100,000 outright, paying for ads that
solicit donations and setting up special displays with a canister
in liquor stores for contributions.
   Two of the group's 370 chapters _ in Baltimore and Charleston,
W.Va. _ declined to participate, saying they did not want to accept
money from a liquor company.
   ``It's a hard choice to make when you are desperate for money,''
said Sister Mary Judith, who heads the Baltimore community group
affiliated with Literacy Volunteers.
   Miami-based Burger King already had begun promoting its BK
Double hamburgers when an earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay
area last month.
   Chief executive Barry Gibbons told his admakers that Burger King
should ``give something back'' to communities struck by earthquakes
and hurricanes. The ads pledge to donate 25 cents to the Red Cross
for each BK Double sold through Nov. 23.
   The appeal raised $3 million in the first two weeks of the
four-week promotion.
   Still, the approach doesn't sit well with critics like Hughes.
   ``While what Burger King was doing was good, it wasn't
completely noble when they told me I had to buy a Whopper,'' he
said.

   Since everything from stamp collecting to
dieting to entertainment can be had on video, why not the news?
   MPI Home Video has released ``The San Francisco Earthquake,'' a
one-hour look at the devastating earthquake of Oct. 17, which
measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, killed 66 people and did an
estimated $7 billion in damage.
   According to promotional material, the $14.95 tape promises to
``examine through dramatic footage the 15 catastrophic seconds that
San Francisco and the entire Bay Area experienced as well as the
deadly aftermath of the quake.''
   The video also gives earthquake safety tips and provides a list
of agencies where contributions can be sent. The video is produced
by ABCNEWS.
   Elsewhere, SVS has produced a series of narrated children's
stories on video. Although animation on the tapes hardly matches
the quality and artistry of Disney, the storytelling is upbeat and
imaginative.
   Narrators include Glenn Close doing ``The Emperor and the
Nightingale'' and ``The Legend of Sleepy Hollow''; Danny Glover,
``How the Leopard Got His Spots''; Jodie Foster, ``The Fisherman
and His Wife''; Jack Nicholson, ``How the Rhinoceros Got His Skin''
and ``How the Camel Got His Hump''; Robin Williams, ``Pecos Bill'';
Meryl Streep, ``The Tailor of Gloucester,'' ``The Tale of Mr.
Jeremy Fisher'' and ``the Tale of Peter Rabbit''; and Holly Hunter,
``Three Billy Goats Gruff'' and ``Three Little Pigs.''
   The videocassettes have a suggested retail price of $14.95.

   ``Leviathan'' (MGM-UA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   Nothing like borrowing from every sci-fi, high adventure,
creature feature and still coming up a loser. George P. Cosmatos'
``Leviathan,'' starring Peter Weller and Richard Crenna, does
exactly that.
   It's easy to spot the basic recipe for ``Alien'' and ``The
Abyss'' in this tale about the mutant result of a failed experiment.
   Most of the action takes place underwater, where a mining team
(shades of ``The Abyss'') is trapped with a genetic mess. The
underwater photography is not very special, but the special effects
are _ especially Stan Winston's creature.
   Weller, who turned ``Robocop'' into a cult hit of the 1980s,
provides well-need humor to an otherwise slow, very slow, story.
   This video won't keep you on the edge of the sofa, but it's as
good as any adventure fright night on commercial TV.
   ``Leviathan'' also features Ernie Hudson, Amada Pays and Daniel
Stern.

five years, the government said.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday the September deficit fell
21.4 percent from August, when the trade gap posted a $10.1 billion
difference, the largest of the year.
   The drop resulted from a 3.9 percent decline in imports to $39

   Carlton Communications PLC, a major British TV and
communications concern, said it has entered into a joint TV
production venture with the U.S. entertainment giant Paramount
Communications Inc.
   Paramount's British unit, Paramount Television Ltd., will buy 49
percent of Carlton's Zenith television production subsidiary for an
undisclosed sum, the companies said in a joint statement Thursday.
   Analysts said the deal enables Zenith to expand faster in the
United States, and gives Paramount a stronger footing in Europe,
whose television networks are being deregulated rapidly.
   The companies said the deal showed Paramount's commitment to
Zenith's development of television programs for the global market.
Paramount will distribute Zenith programs internationally.
   ``This partnership between Carlton and Paramount will add
further strength to Zenith's next stage of development in a rapidly
changing production environment,'' said Bob Phillis, Carlton's
group managing director and chairman of Zenith.
   Mel Harris, president of Paramount's international television
division, said the agreement ``indicates Paramount's long-term
commitment to both global production and to increasing our
partnership activities within the European Community.''
   Zenith, while a small part of Carlton's overall operations, is
Britain's biggest independent television program maker. It supplies
programs to British networks as well as European and U.S. network
and cable companies.

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. said it is spending $300
million for three new electronics plants, two of them overseas,
which will begin making car and truck components during the next
three years.
   The first new plant to be in operation will be in Worcester
Township, Pa., about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia. It will
replace a nearby outdated factory in Lansdale.
   That plant next year will begin making electronic engine control
devices, anti-lock brake parts and sensors, the company said. About
2,600 people are employed at Lansdale and the new plant will have
more than 2,000 workers when full production is reached next year.
   The company also is building plants in Cadiz, Spain, and Lisbon,
Portugal.
   The Spanish plant will make engine controls in mid-1991 and
employ about 350 people. The Portuguese plant will employ about
1,700 when it reaches full production of audio components in 1992.

   AT&amp;T says it will increase some domestic
long-distance rates, prices for calls to various foreign locations
will be changed and certain international rates will be simplified.
   Basic night and weekend prices for long-distance calls will go
up about 1.3 percent. That would amount to 2 cents per minute on a
call from New York to Los Angeles, the company said Thursday.
   The rate hike, totaling $34 million, should average out to about
3 cents per month per customer, it said.
   The higher rates cover interstate calls after 11 p.m. during the
week and all weekend until 5 p.m. on Sundays.
   In addition the company said it is simplifying rates for calls
to India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal, reducing some
prices and changing from three rate pariods to two.
   There will be an increase, however, on prices for calls to
Romania, Suriname and Macao.

<HEAD>Avon Says `Enough is Enough,' Pledges to Fight for Continued Independence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreseeing another takeover battle, Avon
Products Inc. has issued a declaration of war against a ``crop of
raiders'' and pledged to fight for the cosmetics company's
continued independence.
   ``Avon has beaten back three unsolicited takeover efforts in the
last year. We were prepared to fight to keep Avon independent then
_ and we're prepared to fight again,'' the company's board of
directors said Thursday in a letter to shareholders.
   The letter, to be published in newspapers across the country on
Friday, was released in advance by the New York-based direct sales
company. It attempts to slam the door shut on an investment group
that recently disclosed it owns 6.9 percent of Avon stock and may
consider making a takeover proposal.
   The group, a limited partnership called Chartwell Associates,
includes a senior executive of Mary Kay Corp., the privately held
parent of door-to-door marketer Mary Kay Cosmetics. Others in the
investment alliance include the Gordon P. Getty Family Trust and
the Fisher real estate family of New York.
   The Avon board blasted the group for engaging in ``double talk''
by promising not to merge Avon with Dallas-based Mary Kay nor to
join the two companies' sales forces.
   ``This crop of raiders says it has no intention of merging Avon
with Mary Kay or otherwise interfering with the operations of the
company,'' the letter said. ``But that's double talk, because at
the same time they say they will immediately install a financial
man from Mary Kay as Avon's chairman and chief executive officer.''
   The letter, bearing the headline ``Enough is Enough,'' urged
Avon's sales representatives to write to the investment group on
the company's behalf. It said sales reps have told Avon that ``they
can't be sold and that they won't go to work for Mary Kay. To our
representatives, Mary Kay is the enemy.''
   The board said the attention of the company and its salespeople
is once again being diverted unproductively by unwanted suitors.
   ``These distractions have already cut measurably into the
productivity of Avon's salespeople. The attacks on Avon are
undermining our business ...,'' said the board's letter.
   Earlier this year Avon rejected outright takeover proposals from
the rival direct sales company Amway Corp. of Ada, Mich. and from
Minneapolis-based investor Irwin Jacobs. Avon also fended off
takeover feelers from Mary Kay. Amway offered $2.1 billion for Avon
and Jacobs' offer was worth $2.85 billion.

<HEAD>Continental To Buy $4.5 Billion of Airbus Jets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines, which may be put up for
sale, has agreed to buy 40 foreign-made Airbus jets for about $4.5
billion.
   Financially struggling Texas Air Corp., Continental's parent,
said Thursday the new A330 and A340 planes would allow Continental
to develop new markets and replace other planes in its fleet. The
company said it was the largest single order ever for both aircraft
types.
   Houston-based Texas Air, the nation's biggest airline company,
said up to 10 of the new jets may be assigned to its Eastern
Airlines unit, which is struggling through an 8-month-old strike
and bankruptcy-court reorganization.
   In May, Texas Air placed a $2.8 billion order for 100 Boeing
737-300s, including 50 firm orders and 50 options.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo, who earlier this year said the
fallout from the Eastern strike might prompt the sale of sister
Continental, told a news conference Thursday that Texas Air's
directors would consider such a sale ``in due course.'' He refused
to comment further.
   The unions representing machinists, ground workers, pilots and
flight attendants have been on strike against Miami-based Eastern
since March 4. The airline is trying to rebuild under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection and has replaced the union workers.
   In response to the Airbus order, a spokesman for the striking
Eastern pilots said the deal showed Texas Air was building up
Houston-based Continental to the detriment of Eastern.
   ``That's been the plan all along; that's the reason that Eastern
is in the condition it's in,'' said pilots union spokesman Skip Orr
in Boston.
   Texas Air reported last week that it lost $158 million in the
third quarter, up from a loss of $114.1 million in third quarter
1988, due to continued losses by Eastern that offset profits at
Continental.
   The medium- and long-range Airbus jets ordered by Continental
involve ``very revolutionary new concepts'' such as advanced
computerized controls and built-in test equipment, Lorenzo said.
The planes can be flown by two-pilot crews rather than the
traditional three for larger aircraft.
   The jets are made by Airbus Industrie, a European consortium
that competes with Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. of the
United States.
   Lorenzo said Texas Air had secured ``reasonable'' financing from
Airbus as part of the transaction, but hadn't made a final decision
on whether it will finance the deal that way.
   Also participating in the news conference were Jean Pierson,
managing director of Airbus, and Continental's new president,
Mickey Foret. Foret recently replaced Joseph Corr, who resigned
after less than 10 months on the job. While remaining as Texas Air
chairman, Lorenzo was named Continental's chairman and chief
executive officer, positions Corr also held.
   The jet order consists of 10 firm orders and 10 options for the
A330, and another 10 orders and 10 options for the A340. Texas Air
has the right to vary the distribution of plane types. Deliveries
are to begin in February 1993.
   Separately Thursday, Airbus officials in Paris confirmed they
have held advanced talks with the Soviet airline Aeroflot for an
order of Airbus A310 jets. News reports have said the Soviet
Union's national carrier plans to buy five A310s and take options
on five others.
   In addition, Air France announced it plans to finalize an order
for seven Airbus A340-300 jets Monday and take options on four
additional planes.

   Continental Airlines' agreement to buy 40
foreign-made Airbus jets in a deal valued at about $4.5 billion,
announced Thursday, is the latest in a heavy wave of new plane
orders by major airlines and leasing companies.
   The order came on the heels of Wednesday's announcement by Delta
Air Lines that it will buy up to 260 new jets from McDonnell
Douglas Corp. and Boeing Co. for more than $10 billion.
   Other major orders placed in recent years, in descending order
by size:
   _$17 billion order in April 1989 by Ireland's GPA Group Ltd. for
308 new planes from three manufacturers, the biggest order in
aviation history for commercial jetliners.
   In the Irish leasing company's deal, Boeing received $9.4
billion in firm orders for 92 Boeing 737 models, 50 757s and 40
767s. All have two engines. McDonnell Douglas got firm orders of
$3.1 billion for 64 MD-80 twin-jets and 8 MD-11 three-jet models.
Airbus Industrie, a European consortium, received firm orders of
$4.3 billion for 30 A320s, 10 A330s and two A340s. Also, options
for an additional 10 A330s and two A340s.
   _$10.7 billion order in September 1988 to Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas by Delta. The airline ordered nine MD-11 jumbo jets and
nine Boeing 767s, and took options on another 31 MD-11s, 16 767s,
100 MD-88s and 50 Boeing 757s. Value estimated by analysts since
Delta did not disclose dollar amounts.
   _$6 billion order in February 1989 to McDonnell Douglas by
American Airlines for 50 MD-11 wide-body jetliners, at $4 billion,
and 100 MD-80s, at $2 billion. Only eight of the orders for MD-11s
are firm. Value estimated by industry analyst, since neither the
manufacturer nor the buyer would divulge details.
   _Up to $5.20 billion in orders in March 1989 by American for up
to 150 Dutch Fokker-100 short-haul planes and 35 Boeing jets.
American placed firm orders for 75 Fokkers and options for another
75 in a deal potentially worth $3.09 billion. The Boeing order is
for 25 757-200s and 10 767-300ER aircraft, with an estimated value
of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion.
   _$5.04 billion order in May 1988 to Boeing and Airbus by
International Lease Finance Corp. Orders were for 78 Boeing 737s,
18 Boeing 767s and four 747 Boeing jumbo jets, plus four Airbus
A300s, six A310s, 18 A320s and two A340s. Options include 19 737s,
four 767s and one 747.
   _$4.1 billion order in August 1986 by British Airways PLC for 16
late-model Boeing 747s and 12 options.
   _$4.1 billion order in December 1987 by Air France for 16 747s
and 12 options.

   For 1988, Boeing's orders for 640 jetliners represented more
than one-half of all the 1,104 jetliners ordered from major
manufacturers. Others were McDonnell Douglas, 240; Airbus, 161;
British Aerospace, 39; and Fokker, 24.

<HEAD>Drabinsky Misses Deadline For Financing To Take Movie Chain Private</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: All dollar figures are Canadian.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cineplex Odeon Chairman Garth Drabinsky says he
will continue to work on a proposed bid to buy the major theater
chain, which he founded, after missing a deadline to obtain
financing for the deal.
   Drabinsky and his partner, Cineplex Vice Chairman Myron
Gottlieb, were to have secured financing by Wednesday for their
proposed bid of $16.40 (Canadian) per share for Cineplex valued at
more than $700 million.
   The pair said in a statement Thursday that ``adverse market
conditions and ... a difficult financial climate'' were partly
responsible for their inability to find a backer.
   But they also said they were still negotiating with a special
committee of the Cineplex board that was set up to examine offers
for the company, which operates one of the largest movie theater
chains in the United States.
   ``We are discussing possible extensions and revisions'' to the
proposed bid, committee spokesman Sandra Kolber confirmed.
   Possibilities under consideration include an offer at a lower
share price, and a restructuring under which certain company assets
would be sold to chip away at $750 million in long-term debt,
Kolber said from Montreal.
   Cineplex stock, which fell 50 cents to $12.63 Wednesday on the
Toronto Stock Exchange, was off another dollar Thursday, closing at
$11.63.
   In their statement, Drabinsky and Gottlieb said they remain
``highly confident'' that financing would be arranged for an
alternate buyout proposal.
   The success of such a deal could depend on whether MCA Inc. of
Los Angeles and Claridge Inc. of Montreal, Cineplex's two top
shareholders, are willing to accept less than $16.40 per share for
their stock, said Marianne Godwin, an analyst with Merrill Lynch
Canada.
   Drabinsky is likely having trouble financing a deal because of
the company's poor financial record, she said.
   On Tuesday, Cineplex reported a net loss of $8.4 million for the
third quarter that ended Sept.30, compared with a profit of $17.2
million for the same period a year earlier.
   Cineplex Odeon Corp. is North America's second-largest theatre
chain, with 500 locations and 1,870 screens.
   Drabinsky, a 41-year-old lawyer, founded the company in Toronto
a decade ago. He proposed buying the business Oct.25, and got MCA
and Claridge to agree to sell their stock if a Nov.15 financing
deadline was met.
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb were also to be reimbursed by Cineplex
for up to $10 million in expenses related to their bid if they met
the deadline.

<HEAD>NYSE Says Computerized Program Trading Declined in October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange said computerized
program trading declined in October, but analysts cuationed that
the data should not be interpreted as a direct response to recent
market gyrations.
   Program trading strategies accounted for 9.7 percent of an
average total daily volume of 182.4 million shares, or 17.7 million
shares a day in October, on the NYSE, the nation's largest stock
exchange.
   That marked a decline from 20.9 million shares, or 13.8 percent,
of a total of 151.8 million shares traded daily in September, the
NYSE said Thursday. That was the largest percentage since the Big
Board began tracking the numbers in July 1988.
   ``The numbers are interesting as a statistic but they don't
really provide any insight into what program trading does to the
marketplace psychology,'' said Jack Barbanel, president of First
Global Asset Management Inc.
   ``This 9 percent may cause the market to generate another 5
percent in volume,'' he said.
   The Big Board defines program trading as any order for the
purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks. A strategy known as index
arbitrage, which links stock and stock-index futures trading, has
been blamed widely for heightening market volatility.
   Barbanel also said the NYSE's calculations are not limited to
index arbitrage and have come under criticism for possibly
overstating the amount of actual program trading activity. The NYSE
said index arbitrage accounted for 53.8 percent of its October
program trades.
   Several Wall Street brokerages abandoned index arbitrage for
their own and customer accounts in late October, and the lower NYSE
figures may somewhat reflect the exodus, analysts said.
   Debate over program trading intensified after a 190-point drop
by the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 13 and a rapid 80-point
rise during the Oct. 24 session.
   Investors and corporations complained that the strategy was
scaring away individual investors and making it harder to raise
capital in the stock market.
   The NYSE earlier this month instituted a series of measures
limiting program trading during times of market volatility and
encouraged member firms to avoid the strategy when the markets
surge. A bill that would limit some aspects of program trading is
pending before Congress.
   The Big Board reported that program trading on all markets
averaged 20.8 million shares a day in October, down from 24.0
million the previous month. It said 84.9 percent of October's
trading took place on the NYSE, with 13.4 percent abroad and 1.7
percent in other U.S. markets.
   Among brokerages, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. was the largest program
trader in October with 58.7 million shares traded during the month,
followed by Salomon Brothers Inc. with 57.2 million shares and
Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. with 56.9 million shares. A small Philadelphia
investment management firm, Susquehanna Investment Group, was the
fourth-largest program trader, up from ninth in September.
   Morgan Stanley and Kidder Peabody said they ceased index
arbitrage trading for their own accounts late in October. Several
other firms followed with similar steps.

<HEAD>Life at Keating Resort Goes On Despite Firing of Top Officials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal management hasn't seemed to affect the
ambiance for guests of The Phoenician, a $270 million resort hotel
owned by Charles Keating's failed Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   Keating and 23 family members and associates were dismissed
Thursday from their managerial positions at the Phoenician and
Lincoln's other upscale property, the Cresent Hotel in Phoenix.
They were replaced by managers hired by federal regulators.
   Regulators, accompanied by FBI agents, Phoenix police officers
and private security guards, seized the properties at 1:30 a.m.,
according to Alan J. Whitney, a spokesman for the Resolution Trust
Corp., the federal agency created this summer to handle failed S&amp;Ls.
   Few of the guests staying at the 605-room Phoenician seemed
particularly aware of the change in management. Life went on at the
resort's sprawling golf, tennis and golf complex carved from the
base of a mountain overlooking Phoenix and Scottsdale.
   A.J. Stoll of Oregon, who was vacationing with his wife, Sally,
said he had noticed new faces and was aware of the RTC-forced
change in management.
   ``We see them all over with their walkie-talkies _ the feds. The
people who work here all smile at you. The feds don't smile,'' he
said.
   Jayne Glenn, who lives in one of the Phoenician cottages, said
the new management could only be an improvement.
   ``It's not run very good,'' she said. ``The food is bad and the
service is bad. They just can't get their act together.''
   ``We've not heard a thing and we've been here all day,'' said
Paul Hertz of Miami, as television news helicopters buzzed over the
resort and camera crews roamed the marbled lobby.
   Room rates at the Phoenician, featured by Robin Leach on his
television special ``The Rich and Famous, 1989 World's Best,''
range from $200 to $3,750 a night.
   Travel agents were unsure what effect the action would have on
reservations at the palatial Phoenician, which paid $25 million for
original art to hang in its hallways and ordered more Steinway
pianos at one time _ eight, for a total of over $350,000 _ than any
private company in history.
   ``I think we would have to kind of study what the impact is
going to be before we would advise our customers,'' said Rob
Wunsch, a travel agent with the American Express Travel Service in
Denver.
   An agent for Ask Mr. Foster Travel in Denver, who refused to
give her name, said her office had been told a week ago not to book
customers at the 344-room Crescent, which targets business
clientele.
   One person who will be discouraged from returning to the
Pheonician is Keating himself, who used to have an office there,
regulators said.
   A spokesman for Keating denounced the seizure as ``the most
despicable, outrageous, blatant act of terror we have ever seen by
our U.S. government.''
   ``The Gestapo-like tactics used on employees and management of
the resort are just unconscionable,'' added Bradley Boland, senior
vice president of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental
Corp. of Phoenix, and Keating's son-in-law.
   Keating's continuation as manager of the Phoenician had galled
members of the House Banking Committee, which is investigating the
collapse of the Irvine, Calif.-based thrift. The debacle is
expected to be the nation's largest savings and loan failure,
costing taxpayers an estimated $2 billion.
   Although Keating drew no salary as manager of the Phoenician, he
continues to receive $400,000 a year as chairman of American
Continental. He is scheduled to testify before the House banking
panel Tuesday.
   American Continental filed for federal bankruptcy protection
April 13, and federal regulators seized Lincoln and its
subsidiaries, including The Phoenician, the next day.
   They later filed a $1.1 billion lawsuit against Keating and his
associates alleging fraud and racketeering.
   However, they could not dismiss Keating until they obtained the
approval of the Kuwaiti Investment Office, which has a 45 percent
interest in the resort and the right to block management changes,
Whitney said. The office, based in London, makes real estate
investments on behalf of the Kuwaiti government, he said.

<HEAD>Bush Presses South Korea on Currency Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea is manipulating its currency to
gain advantages in foreign trade, the U.S. says, and the Bush
administration will press for progress by April in negotiations
aimed at stopping the practice, a senior Treasury official says.
   Informal talks since the summer of 1986 have had some result in
persuading the South Koreans to allow their currency, the won, to
appreciate against the dollar, David C. Mulford, Treasury
undersecretary for international affairs, said Thursday.
   But, the Korean system remains ``inherently manipulative,'' and
the United States hopes in January to begin a round of formal talks
with Seoul aimed at changing it, Mulford told the Senate Banking
subcommittee on international finance and monetary policy.
   Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes, D-Md., chairman of the panel, warned that
Congress was growing impatient with South Korea and would press to
tie the currency question to other U.S.-Korean trade matters if
progress wasn't evident soon.
   The largest U.S. trade deficits are with Japan and West Germany,
but in recent years the deficit has soared with newly
industrialized countries in Asia such as South Korea and Taiwan.
   In October 1988, the United States charged both South Korea and
Taiwan with manipulating their currencies to maintain their trade
surpluses. Efforts by the two countries to keep their currencies
weak make their goods cheaper on U.S. markets and make American
products more expensive for their consumers.
   However, Mulford noted with approval that Taiwan changed its
system in April and said there is no evidence that its central bank
continues to intervene in currency markets. The New Taiwan dollar
has strengthened by 5 percent since April, in contrast with the
won, which has weakened slightly, he said.
   Meanwhile, at a separate hearing, a private economist told a
House Banking subcommittee that South Korea's shrinking trade
surplus indicates there is no basis for the currency manipulation
charges. The surplus has shrunk 28 percent in the first nine months
of this year compared with the same period last year.
   John Williamson, senior fellow at the Institute for
International Economics, said the administration was attempting to
deflect attention from its own failure to live up to international
monetary agreements by shrinking its budget deficit.
   However, Sarbanes said, ``I think the currency manipulation has
to be straigtened out. ... The fact that (South Korea's) surpluses
may have dwindled somewhat does not eliminate that problem.''
   In a related matter, Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel
H. Johnson, in response to a question from Sarbanes, acknowledged a
rift between the central bank and the Treasury Department over
exchange rate policy.
   Unlike Treasury officials, Johnson said he and other Fed members
do not believe in massive currency sales to drive the dollar lower
when market forces are driving the value higher. Fed members favor
such sales only to stabilize a disorderly market, he said.
   Sarbanes faulted the Fed for allegedly undermining a Sept. 23
agreement among the United States and its major economic allies
that sought to drive the dollar lower.
   However, both Johnson and Mulford played down the significance
of the dispute and said policy coordination was working smoothly.

   Federal regulators handling the nation's
largest savings and loan failure have seized a luxury resort in the
Arizona desert from Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., the
S&amp;L's owner.
   The regulators, accompanied by FBI agents, local police and
private security guards on the 1:30 a.m. raid Thursday, took
control of two Keating properties: the Phoenician, a 605-room golf
resort near Scottsdale, and the 344-room Crescent Hotel in Phoenix.
   Keating, his wife, Mary Elaine Keating, two daughters, two
sons-in-law and 18 other associates were fired from management
positions at the properties, owned by a subsidiary of Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association, Irvine, Calif.
   Later Thursday, a source said the Senate Ethics Committee would
hire an outside counsel to investigate five senators who received a
total of $1.3 million in campaign contributions from Keating and
intervened with regulators on his behalf.
   There was no indication from the source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, whether the committee had decided on an individual to
investigate Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; John McCain, R-Ariz. and Donald
Riegle, D-Mich.
   In related developments:
   _Cranston became the third senator to formally respond to the
Senate Ethics Committee inquiry into the allegations that the five
senators intervened with regulators on behalf of Keating.
   _A top aide to S&amp;L regulator M. Danny Wall complained that
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden, in
criticizing the thrift agency, gave sworn testimony to the House
banking panel that was ``simply not true.''
   A Keating representative called the seizure of the Phoenician
``the most despicable, outrageous, blatant act of terror we have
ever seen by our U.S. government.''
   ``The Gestapo-like tactics used on employees and management of
the resort are just unconscionable,'' said Bradley Boland, senior
vice president of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent
company.
   ``They walked in ... they locked offices, they locked desks.
Then they went out into the community to the homes of the core
management group and posted severance notices on their front doors.
These guys are gutless, ruthless, faceless bureaucrats trying to
carry out their ongoing vendetta against Charlie Keating,'' Boland
said.
   Keating's continuation as manager of the Phoenician had
particularly irked members of the House Banking Committee, which is
investigating the thrift's collapse, expected to cost taxpayers $2
billion.
   A recent newspaper advertisement for the resort said Robin Leach
featured the Phoenician on his television special, ``The Rich and
Famous, 1989 World's Best.'' Room rates range from $200 a night to
$3,750 for the most expensive suite, according to the House panel.
   Alan J. Whitney, a spokesman for the Resolution Trust Corp.,
created in August to handle failed S&amp;Ls, said regulators had been
trying to take over the resort since April, when they seized
Lincoln.
   The government filed a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeering suit
against Keating and his associates, but officials were delayed in
taking over the resort because its minority owner, the Kuwaiti
Investment Office, had the authority to block changes in management.
   Obtaining approval from the London-based Kuwaiti office was
awkward and cumbersome, Whitney said.
   Although Keating was not paid as manager of the Phoenician, he
continues to receive a $400,000-a-year salary as chairman of
American Continental, which has filed for protection under
bankruptcy laws.
   Keating is scheduled to testify before the House banking panel
on Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, Cranston said in his written response to the ethics
committee that he violated no laws, ethical standards or Senate
rules in two April 1987 meetings with regulators examining
Lincoln's finances.
   ``I never attempted to derail any investigation of wrongdoing at
Lincoln, nor did I ever suggest ... that an investigation be
delayed,'' Cranston wrote.
   Riegle and DeConcini provided material to the committee earlier.
Glenn and McCain have not filed formal responses, but have denied
wrongdoing.
   The SEC is investigating the accuracy of financial statements
filed by American Continental, and Breeden told the House banking
committee earlier this week that Wall's agency undermined the probe
in 1988 by accepting Lincoln's financial statements as accurate.
   Thrift office senior deputy Karl T. Hoyle said in a letter to
the banking panel that regulators ultimately rejected much of
Lincoln's financial statements and, in any event, did nothing that
would have prevented the SEC from pursuing its investigation.

   A Senate panel has voted to send the
nomination of Mary C. Schapiro to the full Senate for confirmation
as a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Ms. Schapiro has served on the SEC since December 1988 when she
was named as a recess appointment by then-President Reagan.
   President Bush nominated her for a full five-year term last week.
   Appointments to the five-member board, which oversees the stock
markets, are subject to Senate approval.
   Although few members of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs Committee were on hand for Ms. Schapiro's confirmation
hearing, she was praised for her 11-month stint on the commission.
   She told the committee that her priorities were getting more
money for the agency to raise staffers' salaries and maintaining
the agency's enforcement drive.
   While she agreed that SEC staffers should be paid more, there
also is a need for more of them, said Ms. Schapiro.
   Because of the SEC's small staff, about 2,200, she said
investment advisers are only examined about once every 12 years by
the agency.
   Ms. Schapiro is a one-time attorney at the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and former general counsel of the Futures
Industry Association.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., the committee chairman,
asked if there may be more major insider trading cases yet to be
found.
   ``I would love to think that what we've done is brought an end
to insider trading. But I think that's probably not the case,''
said Ms. Schapiro.
   ``... We will continue to pursue insider trading, as I think we
have to.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. executives are reaching out again to
the banks that refused to finance an employee-management buyout
plan last month, sources say.
   Separately, leaders of the pilots union at UAL's United Airlines
opened a two-day strategy session Thursday on contract negotiations
and the possibility of a new buyout offer.
   UAL is being pressured by the investor group Coniston Partners,
which is one of its largest shareholders, to increase the company's
stock value.
   A bank official who met with UAL executives Thursday said the
company ``made it perfectly clear there is nothing out there that's
firm'' regarding a sale or restructuring of UAL.
   The bank official characterized the meeting as ``a kind of
goodwill gesture'' aimed at rebuilding ties with the lenders.
   ``I guess it's no secret they're meeting with all the major
banks'' that initially had agreed to help raise financing for the
failed $6.75 billion offer, said the bank executive, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He said 30 or 40 banks had been participating in the failed bid,
and UAL was visiting many of them seeking ``a perspective on what
happened in the last deal and on what might be going on now.''
   UAL said its meetings with U.S. and Japanese lenders were
routine.
   Officials at Citibank and Chase Manhattan, the New York-based
banks that were the lead lenders for the failed bid, declined to
comment on UAL.
   Representatives at the Chicago offices of Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and
Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., two large Japanese banks that were
participating in the original deal, also declined to comment.
   The company's stock plunged in October after the
pilot-management group's $300-a-share buyout bid collapsed when the
buyers failed to get financing.
   UAL's stock fell $4.25 to $184.75 a share Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange. The stock had traded as high as $294 amid the
takeover speculation ub September and October.
   The buyout group's failure to secure financing helped trigger a
breathtaking 190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on
Oct. 13.
   Coniston, a New York-based investment group, is pressuring UAL
to increase shareholder value either through a sale of the company
or a restructuring that would involve a cash payout to stockholders.
   Coniston owns 9.7 percent of UAL's stock and is seeking consent
from other shareholders to dump most of the company's directors,
take control of the board, and direct an ``extraordinary
transaction'' to benefit shareholders.
   UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins confirmed the bank meetings were
taking place but would not comment on their content.
   Meanwhile, leaders of the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots
Association opened a two-day special meeting Thursday in Chicago.
   The pilots have been trying to buy United, the nation's
second-largest airline, since 1987 and have been working without a
contract since April 1988.
   The pilots were discussing contract talks and prospects for a
new buyout bid, sources said.
   United's pilots have threatened to stop flying United's new
Boeing 747-400 aircraft if they fail to get a contract.
   United owns two of the long-distance planes and uses them on
routes from Los Angeles to the Australian cities of Sydney and
Melbourne.

   Stock prices held their gains through midday
Friday despite worse-than-expected British inflation figures.
   The market temporarily shed a couple of points on news that the
retail price index rose 0.8 percent in October and was up 7.3
percent on the year. But no heavy selling emerged, and the market
quickly recovered.
   Trading was thin. Dealers said market makers moved prices higher
in early trading in the face of minimal selling pressure and were
content to see the market at current levels before Wall Street's
opening.
   At noon local time, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share

   Volume amounted to a moderate 203.5 million shares, compared

<HEAD>No More Than 7,300 TCs by Maserati for Chrysler</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has put a 7,300-car limit on its
order with Maserati for the TC two-seat sports coupe, an order the
Italian automaker plans to fill by next May, company officials say.
   The Chrysler TC by Maserati went on sale in January after
several delays because of quality concerns. In a letter last month
to Maserati's parent company, De Tomaso Industries of Italy,
Chrysler said it wanted no more than 7,300 of the cars.
   ``We have been notified by Chrysler that we are to terminate
production of the TC coupe after we build 7,300 cars and we
estimate that will fall in May of 1990,'' said Howard Chase, vice
president and general counsel for De Tomaso Industries Inc., of Red
Bank, N.J.
   Nationwide, through Nov. 10, the 315 Chrysler dealers who handle
the TC by Maserati had sold 1,922 of the cars and have more than
1,770 cars on hand, Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said.
   The car carries a base price of $33,000 with a no-extra-cost
choice of two powertrains.
   ``That would end the TC project. It would not end Chrysler's
involvement with Maserati,'' Chase said from his New York office.
   Chrysler owns 15.6 percent of Maserati SpA, and De Tomaso
Industries owns the rest. Jakobowski said the company has passed
opportunities to increase its stake in Maserati and has no plans to
reduce it.
   Chase said Maserati is involved in discussions with several
automakers about establishing a manufacturing agreement similar to
that with Chrysler. He declined to identify the other companies or
whether any were U.S. based.

<HEAD>Time Magazine Fined Over Allegedly Inaccurate Quote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time magazine was ordered by a court Friday to pay
$2,100 in damages to a Japanese doctor who said the magazine
misquoted her six years ago.
   Judge Eiko Ito of Tokyo District Court ruled that the magazine
had damaged the reputation of the doctor, Etsuko Negishi.
   In its Aug. 1, 1983, issue, the magazine said, ``Two out of
three Japanese women have had an abortion, which is so common, `it
is like having a tooth out,' says Dr. Etsuko Negishi, a woman
gynecologist.''
   ``The article in Time did not quote her accurately,'' said Judge
Ito in the ruling. ``By putting abortion on the same level as
pulling out a tooth, it gave a wrong impression to the readers and
damaged the plaintiff's social reputation.''
   Dr. Negishi said she never made such a comment to Time.
   ``I have never met a Time reporter nor have I ever made such a
comment before,'' she was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying.
``The content (of the quote) contradicts the facts.''
   Time magazine officials in Tokyo were not immediately available
for comment, but according to court documents, the magazine
acknowledged that its reporters had not contacted her. It defended
its action by saying the doctor was quoted by Japanese newspapers,
and the magazine took the quote from them.
   The 49-year-old doctor complained that she was criticized by
colleagues as a result of the article and that it had hindered her
activities as a gynecologist.
   In her suit, Dr. Negishi had demanded that Time pay $420,000 in
damages and print full-page corrections in the magazine and in all
five major Japanese daily newspapers.

<HEAD>Martin Marietta Wins $156 Million NASA Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin Marietta Corp. has been awarded a $156.6
million contract by NASA to launch the first U.S. spacecraft to
Mars since 1976.
   The contract, awarded Thursday to the company's Denver
Astronautics Group, is seen as an important victory in the
competitive commercial space market, where Martin Marietta competes
with McDonnell Douglas Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and the French
Arianespace program to launch private communications satellites and
military payloads.
   The contract calls for Martin to build a 155-foot Titan 3 launch
vehicle and an upper stage booster to propel NASA's Mars Observer
out of Earth orbit. NASA is scheduled to launch the spacecraft in
September 1992.
   The spacecraft will orbit Mars 13 times a day for two years,
studying the planet's geology and climate.
   Martin officials said the contract could be the first of many in
which NASA orders not just rockets but the manpower and expertise
to launch them. NASA is encouraging the commercial space industry
by choosing to launch some government payloads through private
carriers.
   ``It may well be an example of future U.S. government
procurement approaches,'' said Edward Browne, president of Martin
Marietta Commercial Titan Inc.
   Until recently the Commercial Titan program was a problem area
in Martin's otherwise profitable rocket business. The company
originally expected to reap up to $300 million annually launching
private payloads but later scaled back expectations becasuse the
demand for launch services was below the combined supply of rockets.
   The $450 million Mars Observer mission was one of four high
priority missions recommended by a NASA advisory board in 1983.

<HEAD>Allied-Lyons Agrees To Buy Dunkin' Donuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Allied-Lyons PLC, a major British beverage group, and Dunkin'
Donuts Inc. announced today they have entered into a definitive
agreement for Allied-Lyons to buy the international doughnut shop
chain for about $325 million in cash.
   Under terms of the transaction, London-based Allied-Lyons will
pay $47.25 a share for all outstanding shares of Dunkin' Donuts
common stock.
   Dunkin' Donuts, based in Randolph, Mass., has 1,600 U.S. outlets
and 250 abroad.
   Allied-Lyons, which already owns a range of North American food
companies including the tea and coffee group Tetley Inc., said
Dunkin' Donuts ``is a natural strategic fit with our existing
strengths.''
   Richard Martin, Allied-Lyons vice chairman and chief executive,
said the acquisition shows the company's determination to expand
its food division and ``develop the successful Dunkin' Donuts core
franchise business with its strong cash flow.''
   ``The combination with Allied-Lyons will clearly strengthen our
position as the world's largest coffee and doughnut chain,'' Robert
M. Rosenberg, Dunkin' Donuts chairman said in a statement.
   Dunkin' Donuts, which battled takeover attempts for months,
announced in September that it had begun looking at alternatives,
including a merger or leveraged buyout, to try to increase its
stock price.
   The company reported a 34 percent drop in third-quarter
earnings, much of it attributed to costs associated with battling a
hostile takeover attempt from the Canadian partnership DD
Acquisition Corp.
   Last month, under pressure from DD Acquisition, the Dunkin'
Donuts said it had established procedures to accept bids to buy the
company from interested parties. Company officials, nevertheless,
declined to say outright that the company was for sale.
   DD Acquisition Corp., a Canadian partnership between Cara
Operations Ltd., a restaurant franchise company, and Kingsbridge
Capital group, the merchant banking arm of Toronto investor George
Mann's Unicorp Canada Corp., recently increased its offer from $43
a share to $45 a share, or about $308 million. The offer was set to
expire on Monday.

   A woman who said she nearly died from an
unwanted spray of perfume in Bloomingdale's has accepted a $75,000
settlement of her assault lawsuit, her lawyer says.
   Deborah Martorano was hospitalized with ``respiratory distress
and close to death'' three days after a salesperson at the
department store spritzed her with perfume April 30, 1984, said her
lawyer, Michael Gluck.
   Martorano, 36, said she has a long history of asthma and allergy
to perfume, horses, trees, ragweed and dust. She said her first
asthma attack in eight years was triggered by the unwanted spray.
   ``I heard somebody behind me,'' she said in court papers. ``I
turned around and the next thing I knew I was sprayed. My nose
started to burn and my eyes started to tear.''
   Gluck said Thursday that Martorano was in New York Hospital for
11 days and ran up $12,000 in medical bills.
   Martorano was an office administrator for a New York law firm
when she was spritzed and now works for a Los Angeles law firm,
Gluck said.

<HEAD>Resorts Bondholders Make a Deal With Griffin, But Some Question Its
Worth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resorts International Inc. bondholders have
played a game of ``Let's Make a Deal'' with owner Merv Griffin,
trading some of the money they're owed for Resorts stock while
betting he can revive the sickly casino company.
   One of the advisers to the bondholders calls the agreement,
announced last week, a model for how the parties to a near-bankrupt
company can work together.
   ``This had the potential for five years of litigation,'' said
Arthur B. Newman, a Chemical Bank investment banker and bondholder
adviser. ``And no one wins in five years of litigation.'' Except,
of course, the lawyers.
   Newman represents investors who own the $600 million in Resorts
bonds issued before Griffin bought the company from developer
Donald J. Trump last year. The second group of bondholders are
those who bought the $325 million worth of junk bonds that gave
Griffin the money for the takeover.
   Under the agreement, Griffin will give bondholders 78 percent of
the stock in the company, which he owns outright, in exchange for
their going along with a Resorts bankruptcy filing on friendly
terms.
   Griffin, the entertainment magnate and former talk show host,
also agreed to inject $30 million in fresh cash to rehabilitate the
company's aging Atlantic City casino and other properties.
   Resorts, which stopped paying interest on its bonds in August,
will operate under protection of a bankruptcy court for a brief
period, according to the plan, before emerging as a presumably
healthier company early next year with much lower debt.
   The plan will also provide bondholders with new bonds or notes
in the company. It must be approved by owners of two-thirds of the
bonds.
   Newman said the two bondholder groups, along with Griffin's
people, hammered out the agreement in just one week.
   ``Everybody worked very, very hard,'' he said last week.
``Everybody hurts a little,'' he said, referring to compromises
that were made.
   Newman said the Resorts case is the first to his knowledge in
which a major, near-bankrupt company and its creditors agreed to a
reorganization plan before the actual bankruptcy filing. It is
called a prepackaged bankruptcy.
   Newman advised the main creditors group in the Texaco Inc.
bankruptcy case, which was bitterly fought and expensive. Citing
the smooth Resorts deal, he said, ``I think people are just getting
smarter.''
   Some analysts said the Resorts deal. ``It appears to be a fair
compromise,'' said Steven Eisenberg, an industry analyst for Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co. Inc.
   But others said the bondholders may see little of the money they
invested unless the company stages a dramatic turnaround.
   ``Gamblers at Merv Griffin's Resorts have more odds of seeing
their money repaid than the junk-bond holders,'' said Paul Getman,
an economist for Wefa Group, an economic consulting firm in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa.
   Getman had little sympathy for either Griffin or the
bondholders. He characterized Resorts as another over-leveraged
takeover that was based on unrealistic projections of a company's
ability to sell assets and pull in money.
   ``These bonds are what, a year old? Is this what we're coming
to, that you can't trust a promise to repay principle and interest
that is a year old?'' he said of the Resorts high-yield bonds. ``It
is just another chapter in what I think is going to be a long, sad
spectacle in junk-bond ownership.''
   However, the bond market cheered the deal. Prices of Resorts
bonds surged the day the agreement was confirmed.
   Griffin bought Resorts a year ago after a heated takeover battle
with Trump, who owns several other Atlantic City casinos. Another
aspect of the reorganization plan is that bondholders expect to
file a ``fraudulent conveyance'' lawsuit against Trump.
   Such a suit would claim that something of value was transferred
to Trump in the buyout without him giving a fair return to the
company. One such asset is the huge, incomplete Taj Mahal casino in
Atlantic City, which Trump bought for $273 million as part of his
deal with Griffin after Resorts spent about $500 million on it.
   Griffin avoided becoming a target of such a suit by agreeing to
the reorganization plan, according to those involved in the deal.
   In a statement, Trump said Griffin should accept full
responsibility for Resorts' problems, ``instead of pursuing wholly
baseless and ultimately wasteful claims against me.''

   A market reform bill allowing the Securities
and Exchange Commission to halt trading during stock market
emergencies _ with the president's consent _ has cleared the Senate
Banking Committee.
   The proposed Market Reform Act of 1989, passed by the panel on
Thursday, would give the SEC authority to take temporary emergency
action in response to a major market disturbance.
   But the president would be required to state that he does not
disapprove of any action before it could take effect.
   Meanwhile, a similar bill is stuck in committee on the House
side and appears unlikely to make it to the floor before Congress
adjourns for the holidays.
   House staffers said the bill stalled after Rep. Norman Lent,
R-N.Y., the ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee
proposed adding amendements that would limit provisions requiring
broker-dealers to report large trades and the financial status of
their parent companies.
   On the the Senate side, however, the Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs Committee also approved an amendment proposed by Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., that would require the SEC to report back
three months after enactment on whether it has enough authority to
``address the potential for manipulation and fraud'' involving
computerized program trading.
   ``This legislation contains important reforms dealing with SEC
emergency powers,'' said Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., one of the bill's
sponsors. ``These reforms are not going to change the way the
markets operate, but they will help the SEC better understand and
cope with them.''
   The House bill also would give the SEC the power to curtail
practices deemed ``manipulative or abusive'' _ including program
trading _ during periods of high volatility.
   That measure, pending before the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, went farther than the pending Senate bill.
   The Senate bill, which now goes to the full Senate, would give
the SEC authority to:
   _Halt trading during stock market emergencies like the crash of
1987 or the 190-point drop last month.
   _Require large securities transactions to be reported.
   _Require the parent and affiliated companies of securities and
investment firms to verify their financial stability.
   _Coordinate the clearance and settlement of stock, option and
future trades with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
federal agency that oversees the futures markets.
   The Senate bill was introduced in March by Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., and Heinz at the request of the SEC.
   The bill seeks to prevent some of the problems that contributed
to the stock market plunge in October 1987.
   ``It's absolutely critical that we pass this before we go,''
Dodd told the panel, which approved the bill by a voice vote after
leaders said they would oppose attempts to include amendements that
would limit takeovers or leveraged buyouts.

<TEXT>
   Boyd L. Jefferies, the government's star witness
in the GAF Corp. stock manipulation trial, has testified for the
first time that he assumed the company's chairman knew about the
alleged crimes.
   Jefferies, under cross-examination, said Thursday that GAF
Chairman Samuel J. Heymanplayed a role in the 1986 transactions
that form the basis of the government's case against GAF, two
subsidiaries and Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin.
   Heyman has not been charged in the case, which is in its third
trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan following two mistrials.
   ``I felt that Mr. Sherwin and I had been set up by Mr. Heyman,''
Jefferies said on his fourth day on the stand. ``I assumed that Mr.
Heyman had instructed Mr. Sherwin what to do.''
   It was the first time in the three trials that Jefferies
indicated he was acting under instructions believed to come from
Heyman. Under questioning from Sherwin's attorney, Stephen Kaufman,
Jefferies said he wasn't changing his testimony but only ``making
an assumption.''
   Defense lawyers this week have sought to attack Jefferies'
credibility, pointing out several times that he had altered his
testimony from the first two trials.
   The government has charged that Sherwin asked Jefferies to buy
shares of Union Carbide Corp. in October 1986 in an attempt to
raise the company's stock price at a time when GAF wanted to sell
millions of Carbide shares.
   In a deal with the government, Jefferies agreed to testify in
several cases and plead guilty to two felonies. Jefferies, who was
implicated in securities crimes by now-jailed speculator Ivan F.
Boesky, was sentenced last summer to probation and a $250,000 fine.
   The subject of Heyman arose Wednesday when Jefferies was asked
why he didn't discuss with Heyman his purchase of 190,000 Carbide
shares on Oct. 29 and Oct. 30, 1986, when the two were together in
Tucson, Ariz.
   ``I knew that Mr. Heyman did not want to be associated with
it,'' he said.

   A stock manipulation trial involving GAF Corp.
has resumed but without the packed courtroom and media attention it
drew the first time around, before two mistrials took the steam out
of the case.
   ``I think there's just a boredom factor,'' said Alan Bromberg, a
securities law professor at Southern Methodist University. ``How
many times do we want to see this movie?''
   When the trial opened almost a year ago, the judge had to move
the proceedings to a larger courtroom at U.S. District Court to
accommodate a crush of reporters, lawyers and other spectators.
   Now there's plenty of room available at the lower Manhattan
courthouse. Reporters drop by occasionally, but few stories are
filed.
   The testimony earlier this week of Boyd Jefferies, who once
packed the house as government's star securities fraud witness,
drew scant attention, even when he testified for the first time
that he assumed GAF Chairman Samuel J. Heyman directed the alleged
scheme. It was the trial's first nugget of news.
   Much of the third trial of the Wayne, N.J.-based chemicals maker
and a top executive, which started Nov. 1, has been rehash. Despite
the mistrials _ one due to a procedural error, one to a hung jury _
the substance hasn't changed.
   The proceedings began last December as the first criminal trial
stemming from the insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s. On
Wall Street it was seen as a test of whether the government could
win securities convictions before a jury.
   The case also marked the first courtroom appearance of
Jefferies, a Los Angeles stockbroker linked to jailed speculator
Ivan Boesky who agreed to testify in several cases as part of a
plea deal with federal prosecutors.
   GAF, two subsidiaries and vice chairman James T. Sherwin were
charged with stock manipulation for allegedly trying to boost Union
Carbide Corp.'s share price in 1986 shortly before selling a large
block of its stock.
   They also were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and
conspiracy, and the government made the case the opening act of a
half dozen planned white-collar fraud trials.
   But ``GAF I'' ended in a January mistrial after he government
unintentionally withheld a key piece of evidence. In March, the
jury in the second trial deadlocked after 12 days of deliberations.
   Since then, GAF has lost its luster amid a series of flashier
cases. The government has won jury convictions of Florida investor
Paul Bilzerian and six executives in the Princeton-Newport Partners
trial, plus several guilty pleas and the racketeering indictment of
former junk bond financier Michael Milken.
   Speculation over whether Jefferies' testimony would earn him a
lenient sentence also ended. Jefferies, who testified against
Bilzerian, was sentenced in July to probation for his guilty plea
to two felonies.
   ``It's no longer the first,'' said John J. Coffee Jr., a
Columbia University securities law professor. ``Most of the other
cases have been resolved. I think the world will focus on (Milken)
and will not remember GAF.''
   On Wednesday, for instance, three reporters attended part of the
proceedings in Courtroom 705 _ smaller than the site of the first
two trials _ where GAF attorney Arthur Liman cross-examined
Jefferies a second day. One reporter filed a story.
   Liman attacked Jefferies' credibility by raising contradictions
in earlier trial testimony about when he talked to Sherwin, when he
made Union Carbide stock sales and where he kept yellow note pads
in his office.
   Jefferies appeared flustered this time around when he told
Liman: ``To be honest with you, this thing happened a long time ago
and I put it out of my mind.''
   But after a break he turned assertive, saying, ``I had a
contract with Mr. Sherwin to perform a certain duty at the request
of the customer. I think he was very, very pleased.''
   Jefferies said Sherwin asked him in October 1986 to inflate the
stock price of Union Carbide and agreed to cover any losses. The
purpose of the alleged deal was to maximize GAF's gain from the
sale of Union Carbide stock after a failed takeover of the larger
chemical company.
   Sherwin, of Princeton, N.J., said in a courthouse interview this
week that he has been working normally at GAF, which he joined in
1960. While the media and lawyers may be uninterested, associates
say the lengthy case remains an ordeal for him.
   Once a top U.S. chess player, Sherwin talked eagerly about a
15-year-old Soviet boy, Gata Kamsky, who lived with Sherwin's
family briefly after a highly publicized defection in April.
   ``We played ping pong and chess,'' said Sherwin, who is
president of the American Chess Foundation. ``I could beat him in
ping pong.''

   The stock market gained ground today, encouraged
by word of General Electric's plans to buy back as much as $10
billion of its shares.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.22 to 2,644.88 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 602 up, 507 down and
574 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 48.28 million shares at
midmorning.
   General Electric helped stir revived interest in blue-chip
issues, reporting plans for its repurchase of stock over the next
five years and an increase in the quarterly dividend from 41 cents
a share to 47 cents.
   GE shares climbed 2 to 59{.
   Hewlett-Packard, meanwhile, gained 2~ to 44[ on the company's
report of slightly higher quarterly earnings.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose 1] to 98{; Philip Morris | to 41}; American Express \
to 34~, and Bristol-Myers Squibb \ to 55|.
   The session got off to a sluggish start as interest rates rose
in the bond market. Prices of long-term government bonds dropped
about $2.50 for each $1,000 in face value this morning, increasing
their yields to the 7.88 percent-7.97 percent range.
   The Commerce Department reported an unexpectedly strong 12
percent increase in housing starts for October.
   The figures on new construction are notoriously subject to
erratic swings, however, and have seldom exerted much lasting
influence on the stock market in recent years.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .52 to 189.27. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .31 at 372.82.

<HEAD>Car Symbolizing Auto Failure Is Gone, But Not Forgotten</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Edsel, the car that has come to symbolize
failure in modern automaking, may be gone but it's not forgotten.
   There was a time when owners of Edsels, named after Henry Ford's
son, were laughed at and questioned about their mental condition
when they drove the car.
   But three decades after Ford Motor Co. stopped making the car on
Nov. 19, 1959, folks still get together and talk about those
funny-looking cars with the horse collar in the grille.
   According to the Old Cars Price Guide, a 1958 two-door Edsel
Citation hardtop in mint condition could fetch up to $13,000, or
almost four times the original price of $3,500.
   That's not keeping up with the rate of inflation, but it's not
bad for a car that has a reputation as a marketing disaster.
   Paul Yount said he and his wife Ethel buy Edsels out of
affection. They have owned 53 of them at their farm in Polo, Ill.
``When you go crazy, you go crazy,'' he said.
   Yount said it was the Edsel's high price, not its pucker-faced
appearance, that led to its demise. A recession struck in 1957 and
dealers didn't lower their sticker price while they lowered the
other sticker prices, he said.
   The name didn't help, either. Historians have written that the
name, taken from the original Henry Ford's son Edsel Bryant Ford,
initially was thrown out. It was adopted later after thousands of
other names were rejected.
   Edsel buffs even blame the Cold War for hurting the Edsel's
changes.
   ``The public was in a blue funk because at the very time we
introduced the car, the Russians were successful in launching an
intercontinental missile,'' said Gale Warnock, who handled public
relations during the Edsel's 1957 launch.
   He recalled an early Edsel joke that appeared in the New Yorker
magazine showing one person talking to another saying something
like: ``Great, the Russians have an intercontinental missile and we
have an Edsel.''
   ``That really fries me,'' Warnock said of Edsel jokes.
   However, he acknowledged, ``The word Edsel has become a synonym
for loser. Every comedian uses it when they want to describe
something horrible.''
   The only Edsel at Ford these days is Edsel B. Ford II, 40, head
of the company's marketing staffs. He has been on the Ford board of
directors since last year.
   The Sept. 4, 1957, public introduction of the Edsel capped a
launch program that began in March 1956. During those 18 months,
Ford teased the public with magazine advertisements that showed a
blur of an Edsel roaring down a rural highway.
   ``Lately some mysterious automobiles have been seen on the
roads,'' read an advertisement in the July 22, 1957, issue of Life.
``The EDSEL is on its way.''
   When showrooms opened up, crowds were big. A telegram to Edsel
executives from a C. Pickrell of Beacon Edsel in Inglewood, Calif.,
described showroom traffic:
   ``Reception to car fantastic, have written seven orders
delivered five cars. Had approximately 2,000 people through our
showroom. Went through 45 gallons of coffee 26 dozen doughnuts.
   ``Darndest coffee and doughnut town I've ever been in.''
   From there, things quickly went downhill.
   Ford projected sales of 290,000 by 1960, but production, which
is based on sales, fell far short of that. The company made 63,100
Edsels for the 1958 model year, 44,891 for 1959 and just 2,846 for
the 1960 model year before stopping the Edsel assembly line.
   The Edsel had a number of unique features, some of which died
with the car and some that live on only in expensive models today.
   Edsel featured a ``Teletouch'' transmission which had
push-button shifting on the steering wheel hub. That's no more,
anywhere.
   But it also offered as accessories a compass, a station-seeking
radio and thermometers to show inside and outside temperatures,
sophisticated versions of which are on today's cars.
   Those kinds of features helped the car get some rave reviews
from auto journals of the day.
   The Edsel ``could very well be an indication of things to
come,'' read a review in Motor Life, a magazine that ceased to
exist on its own in December 1961 when it was absorbed by Sports
Car Graphic.

<HEAD>Shop Around Before Buying Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is one thing above all others that
insurance buyers must do, says Joe Mintz, and that is compare the
offerings of various companies before paying a nickel.
   The reason: Incredible price differences for the same coverage.
   Mintz, a former insurance broker, has only one goal these days _
that is to educate the public and accountants, financial planners,
insurance agents, elected officials and others who have
responsibilities to the public.
   An example: A 54-year-old, non-smoking male friend of Mintz
sought a $325,000 term life insurance policy recently. He checked
with three of the biggest companies in America about annual costs
over a 10-year period.
   The results: One company quoted $30,539, another $22,882 and the
third $21,010.
   The lowest-priced company guaranteed the price. The
second-lowest said it might raise annual premiums after three
years. The highest said annual premiums might rise after just one
year; it didn't guarantee anything after that time.
   Joe A. Mintz, 71, is a legend in insurance circles, a hero by
some accounts, a notorious pest by others. Working from a Dallas
apartment, he and his computer delve deep into the the mysterious
workings of the industry.
   From it comes material for seminars, testimony before Congress
and state boards of insurance, educational speeches before
accounting and financial planning groups, assistance to friends,
and material for a monthly newsletter.
   ``The NROCA News Letter'' _ $72 a year, $45 for six months, $27
for a four-month trial, Dept. R, Box 12066, Dallas, Texas 75225 _
is jammed with personal finance items, some startling and all aimed
at getting the most for a dollar.
   If Joe is sometimes contentious it is in an affable way, because
he prefers evidence to conflict. What he says, therefore, usually
is revealing and convincing, and often deeply irritating, even to
professional practioners.
   Here is another example, a real one as of a month or so ago,
that shows not just the variety of options and products but the
necessity for shopping before buying.
   You are 65, in a 28 percent tax bracket, and concerned about the
future. Your $100,000 nest egg must go a long way, so you consider
some of the options: A certificate of deposit, a life annuity and a
refund annuity.
   At age 65, that $100,000 in a CD would earn you $6,480 a year
after taxes. The life annuity would pay $8,847 a year for nine
years, then $7,500 for life. The refund annuity would pay $8,325 a
year for l0 years, then $7,025 for life.
   The certificate of deposit would be fully taxable.
   The life annuity would be partially taxable until you had been
repaid the $100,000, then it would be fully taxable. It would pay
you as long as you lived, but if you died tomorrow your investment
would be gone.
   The refund annuity would pay you for life, but if you died
before recovering your investment your heir would receive the
remainder of the $100,000.
   Mintz' point is this: You cannot just accept what is available;
you must shop around until you find the product designed for you
and then seek comparisons. Doing so, could mean thousands of
dollars difference a year.
   ``Like all insurance products, payments vary all over the lot,''
he says, making it necessary for the buyer o insist that the agent
shop, ``or better still, ask more than one agent to quote bids.''
   Among questions to ask your agent: How many companies do you
represent? Can you go into the open market? Do you give all your
business to a single company?
   A company that is competitive one week will not be so the next,
says Mintz. And, he says, it isn't much different with savings
acocunts and certificates of deposits at banks, savings and loan
and credit unions.
   Watch your pennies, says Joe. Small amounts saved are the same
as money earned. Invested wisely, that money can grow and make your
working years and retirement better. That's what NROCA _ acorn
spelled backwards _ is about.

   Rochester Telephone Corp. is finding
itself a long way from home these days.
   The name may not ring bells in most parts of the country, but
Rochester Telephone has become one of the country's fastest-growing
and most aggressive telephone companies. This year alone, Rochester
Telephone has scooped up 11 Midwestern companies in places like
Mondovi, Wis., Mt. Pulaski, Ill., and Fairmount, Ind., capitalizing
on moves toward deregulation that have turned small phone companies
into big money-makers.
   In the last five years, Rochester Telephone has grown from a
one-state operation with a few scattered subsidiaries to the parent
company of 23 telephone companies in six states. It is the 16th
largest telephonecompany in the country, including the seven former
Baby Bells.
   When all pending acquisitions are completed, the company will
have 620,000 phone lines, with nearly 30 percent of them outside
its base in the Rochester area. In the glass-and-marble lobby of
the company's downtown headquarters, a colored map showing
Rochester Telephone's subsidiaries is perpetually out of date.
   Stock analysts have been touting the value of the non-Bell phone
companies for years. That enthusiasm has grown as deregulation
appears to be spreading in the industry.
   ``The 1990s will be to the independent telephone companies what
the 1980s were for cable,'' said Kenneth Berents of Butcher &amp;
Singer in Philadelphia.
   Rochester Telephone has its own vice president for acquisitions,
John Purcell. He said prices of small companies have risen 30
percent in the past 18 months, pushed up competition by from other
expansion-minded companies.
   ``Nobody's stealing telephone companies today,'' he said. ``The
competition won't allow it.''
   ``The phone business is a very healthy business,'' said Joel D.
Gross of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York.
``The price is obviously going to go up because the value has gone
up.''
   Small companies _ many of them serving only a few thousand
customers _ have an excellent track record of providing
high-quality service and keeping customers satisfied. Many of them
have been owned by the same family for generations. Without the
bureaucracy of a larger operation to slow them down, they have been
able to install the latest digital technology, often before even
the Bell companies have made the switch, Purcell said.
   The small companies are becoming increasingly profitable as many
states relax regulation and experiment with setting price caps
instead of controlling the profit margin, Gross said.
   Wisconsin, where Rochester Telephone acquired five companies
this year, has been one of the most aggressive experimenters.
   Small companies are adding customers as suburbanites spill out
into rural areas _ making them very attractive to companies such as
Rochester Telephone with bases in mature markets.
   Despite the success of the small phone companies, rapid advances
in technology and changes in the telephone business are making it
harder for them to stay independent. Among other things, they are
are vulnerable to being bypassed by ``tie lines'' that allow
companies to connect far-flung operations without going through the
local phoe company.
   Rochester Telephone persuades small companies to sell out by
allowing its subsidiaries to remain essentially autonomous, Purcell
said. In many cases the owners stay on and run the operation.
Rochester Telephone prides itself on never making hostile
takeovers, he said.
   ``We're not a bank, we're not a holding company _ we're a
telephone company,'' Purcell said. ``Our people are very
experienced telephone people.''
   Rochester Telephone once said it would not expand west of the
Mississippi, but today there are no limits, Purcell said. Company
officials have paid calls on 95 potential acquisitions in 18 states
in the last year, he said.
   But despite the ravenous appetites of companies like Rochester
Telephone, small phone companies are not yet a disappearing breed,
analysts said. The number of small phone companies has shrunk by
nearly 10 percent since 1980 _ and will continue shrinking _ but
there are still about 1,200 left.
   For one thing, the pool of potential buyers of telephone
companies is limited, said James J. Stork, vice president of Duff &amp;
Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   The former Bell companies have not shown much interest in
takeovers, and most non-telephone companies probably don't want to
get involved in a regulated business, Stork said. Corporate raiders
would be unlikely to find much favor with industry regulators, he
said.
   Acquisitions by Rochester Telephone and other large independents
such as Contel Corp. and Century Telephone Enterprises Inc. are
just part of the way phone companies have always operated, Gross
said.
   ``If you go back to the '60s and '70s, that's the way a lot of
the companies were built in the first place,'' he said. ``That's
the way the Bell companies were built at the turn of the century.''

   When the mud dauber wasps at the
Wooster ranch build nests on the telephone lines, cutting off
service, all Patty Wooster does is contact her friend Cheryl at the
phone company.
   Like Ms. Wooster, many of the 1,800 customers of the Calaveras
Telephone Co. ask for service representatives by name. A repairman
is quickly dispatched to knock down wasp nests, repair cut cables
or install new lines.
   In an era of communication conglomerates and impersonal service,
the family-run Calaveras Telephone Co. gives residents of this
remote cattle-ranching community in the Sierra foothills a personal
touch.
   Where other employers give their staff cash bonuses, company
president Howard Tower, 66, goes to the Calaveras county fair and
buys 4-H cattle and pigs, then has them butchered, packaged and
divided between the 21 employees.
   Yet the rural charm and small size of the Calaveras Telephone
Co. mask a modern, high-tech enterprise.
   Tower, an unassuming man with a full head of brown hair, keeps
telephone memorabilia in a hutch in his office. But he proudly
shows off his IBM computer system and would rather talk about the
company's future than its colorful past.
   Located in a part of the Gold Country immortalized by Mark Twain
in his 1865 story, ``The Celebrated Jumping Frogs of Calaveras
County,'' the Calaveras Telephone Co. is a typical example of the
independent phone industry.
   These small ``independents'' were never a part of the AT&amp;T Bell
System, which was forced to divest itself of regional subsidiaries
in 1984.
   Family-owned, rural and normally serving less than 3,000
customers, Calaveras and the 1,200 or so companies like it in the
United States have survived both the building up and breaking up of
the Bell System.
   Gone are the days of local switchboard operators and even
mechanical switching centers. They have state-of-the-art digital
equipment, offering such sophisticated services as call waiting and
voice mail.
   State regulators require telephone companies to give rebates to
customers if profits go above a certain level. Calaveras has been
refunding money to customers even though it has what Tower claims
are the lowest rates in California.
   Operating revenue last year was just over $2 million.
   Despite their success, independent phone companies are declining
in number around the country, according to Dolores Donnelly,
executive vice president of the Western Rural Telephone
Association. The organization oversees financing for phone
companies in 22 states.
   In some cases the companies are bought out by bigger,
acquisition-minded independents like Rochester Telephone Corp. In
other cases, small neighbors merge for greater efficiency, she said.
   ``With a lot of family-owned companies, the kids just don't want
to take over the company. The owners want to retire so they sell.''
   The next generation of the Howard Tower family in the telephone
business is assured, however. All three of the Tower children will
help run the company when Howard passes the handset.
   Sons James, 28, and John, 26, work the company's field
facilities, maintaining the cable and switching centers; daughter
Mary, 29, is the secretary-treasurer, and their mother, Ellen
Tower, is vice president.
   Calaveras Telephone began in 1896, just a few years after
Alexander Graham Bell's patents expired. Tower's father James, then
16, hooked up some mouthpieces to the barbed-wire fence that ran
between his and his uncle's house a mile down the road.
   Within weeks the local copper mines and neighboring ranchers
were clamoring for service. The young entrepreneur, nicknamed
``Barbed Wire Jim,'' recruited windmills, barns, and trees as early
telephone poles to connect the 200-square-mile area.
   The Tower family is active in preserving the county's Gold
Rush-era buildings. Recently family members purchased the old
Copperopolis general store and mining claims office and plan to
restore them.
   Although the boom years of copper and gold mining in
Copperopolis are over, the future of Calaveras Telephone is bright.
The cheap housing and rustic setting are attracting commuters who
work in Stockton, 35 miles to the west, or even the San Francisco
Bay Area, more than 80 miles west.
   The company has grown steadily throughout the '80s and Tower
sees no end in sight. ``We're laying cable as fast as we can,'' he
said. ``We are bound to serve people as best we can.''

   Will the next generation of Asians shun
curbside noodles, curries and other indiginous food in favor of
American burgers and fried chicken?
   Although the answer is still inconclusive, a recent United
Nations report says American fast food has made major inroads
across Asia.
   ``Fast food is the latest megatrend in Asia where it is
definitely making an impact on the culture and lifestyles of the
people, as the people begin to have less and less time for a formal
meal,'' says the report, ``The Socio-Economic Impact of
Transnational Corporations in the Fast Food Industry.''
   The report quoted one Australian-based executive as saying,
``Asians are vulnerable towards fads from the West and some
franchisers regard Asia and other unexplored markets as potential
dumping grounds for franchises.''
   According to the study, U.S. fast-food chains are most prevalent
in Japan, where there are 350 McDonald's franchises and 649
Kentucky Fried Chickens outlets, among others.
   Hong Kong follows close behind, while popularity is growing in
the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan. Thailand is a
relative latecomer but business is booming.
   Overall, Kentucky Fried Chicken does best in Asia, with
McDonald's second.
   The first two attempts in Thailand to introduce fast food were
unsuccessful. The British chain Wimpy's arrived in 1964, followed
by Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1970. Both closed soon after U.S.
soldiers returned home from the Vietnam War.
   However, Mister Donut broke into the market in 1978 and paved
the way for six other U.S.-based franchises.
   At the time of the report, Bangkok had 60 fast-food outlets,
including 25 Dunkin' Donuts, 14 Mister Donuts, seven Pizza Huts,
four Kentucky Fried Chickens, two McDonald's and one Dairy Queen.
More are planned.
   Polls of customers at McDonald's in Bangkok showed they chose to
eat there because of brand loyalty, persuasion by their children,
convenience and atmosphere.
   The study notes that World War II played a major role in
introducing American fast food to Asia.
   Den Fujita, a McDonald's franchise operator in Japan, is quoted
as saying postwar changes in Japan such as the introduction of
bread and milk into the schools by Americans enabled the Japanese
to adapt more easily to hamburgers and milkshakes.
   In the Philippines, the American GI diet became a new status
symbol after World War II. A whole generations of middle-class
Filipinos in the postwar years were raised on hot dogs, pork and
beans, corned beef and Vienna sausages.
   China is one of the few major countries in Asia that has not
readily taken to the fast-food industry. An exception is the
successful two-story Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant on Beijing's
Tiananmen Square.
   As for the future of American fast food, the report provided one
clue: ``Having experienced the clean and cool atmosphere of
fast-food restaurants, children refuse outright to eat at hawkers'
stalls, though the food there is much more delicious and priced
more cheaply.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dunkin' Donuts Inc., which fought off a hostile
takeover attempt earlier this year, said Friday it has agreed to be
acquired by the British food and beverage group Allied-Lyons PLC
for $325 million in cash.
   ``We think this is the best possible deal,'' said Robert
Rosenberg, Dunkin' Donuts chairman. ``We fit right in.''
   Dunkin' Donuts had decided in September to accept friendly bids
after DD Acquisition Corp., a Canadian partnership, mounted a
hostile $43-a-share bid, which later was raised to $45 a share.
   Under terms of the deal with Allied-Lyons, the London-based
concern will pay $47.25 a share for all outstanding common Dunkin'
Donuts shares.
   ``They were the highest bidder,'' Rosenberg said. ``It worked
out well for our stockholders, for our management, for our
franchises.''
   Rosenberg declined to comment on the number of offers his
company received.
   Dunkin' Donuts, based in Randolph, has 1,600 U.S. outlets and
250 abroad.
   Rosenberg said joining Allied-Lyons would strengthen his
company's position as the world's largest coffee and doughnut
chain, and he said the British company supports the goals of
Dunkin' Donuts to expand.
   Allied-Lyons, which already owns a number of North American food
companies including the Baskin-Robbins ice cream franchise and the
tea and coffee group Tetley Inc., said Dunkin' Donuts ``is a
natural strategic fit with our existing strengths.''
   Richard Martin, Allied-Lyons chief executive, said the
acquisition shows the company's determination to expand its food
division and ``develop the successful Dunkin' Donuts core franchise
business with its strong cash flow.''
   Roger Lipton, an analyst with Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. Inc. in
New York, described Allied-Lyons ``as the right kind of buyer.''
   ``This is strategic, rather than financial,'' he said.
   But he also said DD Acquisition still would be a good buyer for
Dunkin' Donuts.
   The Canadian partnership was comprised of Cara Operations Ltd.,
a restaurant franchise company, and Kingsbridge Capital group, the
merchant banking arm of Toronto investor George Mann's Unicorp
Canada Corp.
   Lipton said despite the buyout agreement, the Canadian group
could raise its offer and force the Dunkin' Donuts board to
consider a higher price.
   Eric Evans, a spokesman for DD Acquisition, said his group had
no comment on Friday's announcement, and he would not say if the
partnership might raise its bid.
   Rosenberg said he could not speculate on the possibility of a
higher offer.
   Dunkin Donuts' in August reported a 34 percent drop in
third-quarter earnings, much of it attributed to the battle against
the hostile takeover.

   Housing starts bounced back 12 percent in
October from September's seven-year low, the government reported
Friday, and analsyts said they expect the construction rate to
remain stable through the first quarter of 1990.
   ``The housing market seems to have bottomed out,'' said David
Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home
Builders. But he and other analysts said they do not foresee any
surge in building _ ``just hanging in there.''
   The Commerce Department reported that new homes and apartments
were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million
units last month.
   The 12 percent rebound from September was the sharpest gain
since a 13 percent advance in December 1986. Starts had fallen 4.6
percent in September and 6.4 percent in August.
   Although September's pace was revised up from the 1.26 million
reported earlier, it still was the most sluggish since new homes
and apartments were built at an annual rate of 1.17 million units
in October 1982 during the depths of the 1981-82 recession.
   Many analysts attributed the September construction drop to a
spike in mortgage rates and said the October advance followed a
subsequent decline.
   The housing industry has been among the hardest hit as the
Federal Reserve drove up interest rates to slow economic growth and
lower inflation.
   But the Fed has slowly eased rates over the summer and, except
for the blip in September, mortgage rates have fallen from March's
11.22 percent peak to 9.82 percent by the end of October, according
to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   The higher rates stifled sales and boosted inventories of
single-family homes to an 8.1-month supply by last March, said
Richard Peach, an economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.
As rates have fallen, he said, inventories have dropped to a
6-month supply, which ``by historical standards ... are in good
shape.''
   But even though many analysts expect mortgage rates to drop
another half of a percentage point in coming months, Peach said he
does not expect a major surge in building.
   Construction of single-family homes in October rose 6.9 percent
to an annual rate of 1.03 million units. Single-family starts had
fallen 3 percent in September and 3.5 percent in August.
   Apartment construction rose 28 percent in October to an annual
rate of 393,000 units. It had fallen 9.4 percent in September after
dropping 14 percent in August.
   Total housing starts during the first 10 months of the year were
down 6 percent from the same period of 1988.
   The South, which posted a 14.7 drop for the steepest regional
decline in September, turned in the sharpest increase in October,
up 17.1 percent to 562,000 units. It was followed by the Midwest
with a 16.5 percent gain to 289,000 units.
   Construction rose 6 percent in the Northeast to 176,000 units
and 5.1 percent in the West to 393,000 units.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany on Friday established a minister
of tourism, apparently to draw more visitors.
   Premier Hans Modrow, in presenting his new 28-member Cabinet,
selected Liberal Democrat Bruno Benthien to head the Ministry for
Tourism, a post that didn't exist previously.
   The move is seen as a strong indication East Germany plans to
expand tourism to earn sorely needed hard currency, now that its
borders have been thrown open for its own citizens to travel West
freely.
   While East Germany always has permitted visitors to travel and
drive through its territory, it has also imposed strong
restrictions that discouraged many tourists.
   Included in the restrictions is the mandatory exchange of the
equivalent of 25 West German marks ($14) per day per person while
staying in the country.
   Officially, East Germany has insisted in the past of exchanging
on a one-to-one basis its marks for West German marks. Western
prices for the East German marks fluctuates, but in West Germany is
normally about one West German mark to 10 East German marks.
   The mandatory exchange rate has long been a sore point with West
Germans traveling to visit relatives in East Germany.
   Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, secretary-general of West Germany's
business-oriented Free Democratic Party, said East Germany's
requirements for visitors were ``absurd.''
   ``Through increased tourism the German Democratic Republic could
earn much more than through the current mandatory exchange,'' Mrs.
Schmalz-Jacobsen said.
   Another factor affecting tourism is East Germany's strictly
enforced 62 mph speed limits and the police practice of imposing
on-the-spot fines if it is exceeded even slightly. The fines for
Western visitors must be paid in dollars or West German marks, and
range from $11 up, depending on the seriousness of the infraction.
   In addition, hotels are few in large cities and practically
non-existent in the rest of the country.

<HEAD>SCI Television Creditors Ask That Company Be Forced into Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of three SCI Television Inc. bondholders
has filed a court petition to force the company into involuntary
bankruptcy in move that could result in the sale of its six
television stations.
   The Chapter 7 petition, filed Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Delaware, also asks that a trustee be appointed to oversee the
company and ``bring any appropriate suit against any third parties
responsible'' for SCI's condition.
   SCI Television, controlled by businessman George Gillett and the
buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., has been
struggling under the weight of heavy junk bond borrowing incurred
in its $1.3 billion buyout in 1987.
   It missed payments of principal and interest last month, and
proposed a restructuring under which bondholders would be given a
39 percent equity stake in the company in exchange for some debt
forgiveness.
   In a statement, the Denver-based SCI called the filing ``an
unfortunate diversion'' from its talks with other bondholders about
the restructuring.
   It said the filing ``will not in any way impair or affect the
operations'' of its TV subsidiaries nor does it affect Gillett's
interest under a separate company of the Vail and Beaver Creek ski
areas.
   A Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition would require SCI Television to
sell off its assets to satisfy creditors. SCI has 20 days to
respond to the petition.
   SCI Television owns WSBK-TV in Boston, WJBK-TV in Detroit,
WJW-TV in Cleveland, WAGA-TV in Atlanta, KNSD-TV in San Diego and
WITI-TV in Milwaukee.
   The petition was filed on behalf of the investment firm S.N.
Phelps &amp; Co., based in Greenwich, Conn., and two individuals who
said SCI Television failed to pay scheduled interest last month on
about $180,000 in bonds that they hold.
   SCI said in its statement that the missed interest payments to
the three creditors amounted to less than $15,000.
   The filing came hours after the end of a 30-day grace period for
SCI to find a way to pay an Oct. 15 interest payment or restructure
its debt.
   The company said it has had ``constructive discussions'' about
its proposed restructuring with a bondholders steering committee
and other bondholders who represent 95 percent of the company's
public debt. The three creditors filing the petition were not among
those involved in the talks, it said.
   A lawyer for the petitioners, I. Walton Bader, said his clients
feel the TV stations should be sold because a liquidation could
generate more value than a reorganization of the company or a
restructuring of its debt.
   SCI Television was once part of Storer Communications, a company
acquired in a leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis in 1985. The
Storer TV stations were sold in a second deal for $1.3 billion in
1987.
   Gillett owns about 55 percent of SCI Television and Kohlberg
owns the rest.

<HEAD>Ferranti Says It Lost $338 Million in Fraud, Half in Cash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British defense manufacturer Ferranti on Friday
said it lost more than $157 million in cash because of fraud in its
acquisition of the U.S. company International Signal &amp; Control.
   In total, Ferranti said its loss was the equivalent of $338
million as a result of what it called ``a serious fraud'' involving
bogus contracts which it unwittingly inherited when it bought the
American company in November 1987.
   Ferranti's deputy managing director Charles Scott told a news
conference about half the loss represented cash spirited out of the
American firm, the vast majority before the Ferranti takeover.
   In a rewritten version of its annual report, Ferranti
International Signal PLC said ISC's assets and profits ``were
substantially inflated by a serious fraud which had been running
for some years prior to the merger.''
   Ferranti Chairman Sir Derek Alun-Jones said at the news
conference that the fraud involved the creation of false contracts
and the circulation of money to and from non-existent customers
through various vehicles including some Panamanian and
Swiss-registered companies. ``I think most of the companies have
been liquidated,'' he said.
   Ferranti paid $660 million for the Lancaster, Pa.-based defense
contractor. But it said it now believes the American company had no
net worth at the time of the merger, even though ISC's audited
balance purported to show a net worth of $320 million.
   Alun-Jones said the company expects to initiate legal
proceedings soon to try to recover some of the money, but he said
there was a chance it would never recover anything.
   Scotland Yard's Serious Fraud Office and the U.S. Federal Bureau
of Investigation have said they are investigating. Alun-Jones
refused to say who the company believed was responsible, or where
the money had gone.
   Ferranti has renegotiated a $471 million loan package with its
bankers to keep afloat and has been looking for either a rescue
merger or a substantial injection of capital from a new partner.
   Alun-Jones said he was holding talks with between 10 and 15
people about a possible merger or takeover of the company. He
refused to identify them, citing confidentiality agreements.
   In the meantime, he said, the company will continue to dispose
of businesses which aren't central to its strategy.
   He said the company was nearing completion of the sale of the
maintenance and service division of Ferranti Computer Systems Ltd.
and the disposal of Marquardt Co. in the United States, a maker of
propulsion technology and ordnance products. The combined asset
sales are expected to bring Ferranti around $157 million.
   In its revised report, Ferranti provided numerous figures
updated to reflect its write-off of assets related to the $338
million value previously assigned to the phantom contracts at ISC.
   The write-off was foreshadowed in Ferranti's report to
shareholders at the end of September, when it said it had uncovered
the full extent of suspected contract irregularities at the
American subsidiary. At that time, the company estimated it might
have to take a write-off of $270.5 million.
   Ferranti was alerted to the ISC problems in August, and sent a
team of accountants to examine the true worth of ISC after it
emerged that contracts the company claimed to have secured with
Pakistan, China and a Middle Eastern country didn't exist.
   Ferranti previously had no reason to doubt the validity of ISC's
audited accounts and only discovered the fraud in August after some
trading and management problems had emerged in ISC earlier in the
year, Alun-Jones said.

expensive place on television this January.
   The nation's two largest brewers, Anheuser Busch Cos. Inc. and
Miller Brewing Co., are gearing up to sell their beer with by
staging mock football games in television commercials in
conjunction with Super Bowl XXIV in New Orleans.
   Executives from both companies say they're attempting to take
advantage of the weeks of hype surrounding the game. Both
beermakers claim their packages are the largest Super Bowl
promotions ever, with each planning to spend upwards of $7 million.
   Anheuser Busch is staging a ``Bud Bowl II'' ad campaign that
culminates during the Jan. 28 Super Bowl, with a game featuring
animated teams of Budweiser and Bud Light beer bottles rattling
around on a pint-sized football field. The first such game was
staged during the last Super Bowl.
   ``We're starting a month earlier, we've added an extra promo
spot and we're going to have a lot more display materials in the
stores,'' said Tom Sharbaugh, group brand director for Budweiser.
   Miller, based in Milwaukee, won't say exactly how much it is
spending on its 12-week, pre-Super Bowl campaign centered on a
football game between a ``Tastes Great'' team and a ``Less
Filling'' squad.
   Those teams will be made up of current and former National
Football League players such as Bert Jones, L.C. Greenwood and Joe
Klecko.
   ``We're spending more than $7 million, I can tell you that,''
said Richard Burton, advertising manager for Lite beer. ``We're
talking about real-life talent.''
   Miller's campaign culminates Jan. 14, two weeks before the Super
Bowl, primarily because Anheuser Busch bought all the Super Bowl
television spots allocated for beer advertising.
   Miller's television commercials already have started airing.
Anheuser Busch will begin its ads this week with a spot featuring
sports announcer Brent Musberger.
   Both companies also have fan participation promotions.
   Anheuser Busch expects to receive 400,000 to 500,000 scorecards
from fans who are being asked to write down the score of the Bud
Bowl after each quarter. Fans who send in their scorecards will
receive a commemorative pin.
   Miller has a consumer sweepstakes offering expense-paid trips to
the Super Bowl.

<HEAD>Hearing on Pathe Cinema Purchase Cancelled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French court canceled its hearing Friday on the
purchase of Pathe Cinema by Italian film mogul Giancarlo Parretti
after the government withdrew its objections to the sale.
   The Paris Tribunal of Commerce dropped the case after
determining that the Finance Ministry and Parretti were nearing
agreement to end their dispute over the venerable cimena chain.
   Court officials released no details of any moves toward a
settlement and repeated calls by The Associated Press to the
ministry and Pathe were not returned.
   French financial newspapers reported Friday that the ministry
would no longer contest the sale of Pathe to Max Theret
Investissement (MTI), the Parretti-headed group whose origins have
been debated for months.
   The government has contended that MTI acted as a front for the
Geneva-based Sasea holding company, while Parretti, who owns the
ailing U.S. Cannon film group, said his funds came mostly from a
string of successful business ventures in Italy.
   The distinction became crucial after MTI purchased majority
shareholdings in Pathe last year because Switzerland, the home of
Sasea, is not a member of the 12-nation European Community.
   French law requires that non-EC investors seek government
approval to purchase more than 20 percent of a French concern. But
MTI bought a 52 percent stake in Pathe directly from the Banque
Rivaud and increased its holdings with further purchases from
minority shareholders.
   Several scheduled court appearances were postponed over the past
four months as Finance Ministry investigators tried to build a case
against Parretti and divine the origin of the funds behind MTI.
   Parretti meanwhile created a new Amsterdam-based holding company
called Pathe Europe and promised to put Pathe Cinema under its
control. Its shareholders include two Parretti-controlled
Luxembourg holding companies.
   Negotiations followed between MTI and ministry officials, and
the government reportedly promised to abandon its case if an EC
character could be established for Pathe Cinema.
   The proposals also involved having the bulk of Pathe stock
revert to previous owners, leaving the Parretti group with a
holding of under 20 percent.
   Last month the European Commission in Brussels rebuked France
for blocking the Pathe deal and scheduled a hearing before the the
European Court of Justice to see what evidence of illegal
activities French officials could bring against Parretti.

   As one of the nation's top stockbrokers, Boyd L.
Jefferies made millions keeping his numbers in the best possible
order. He may have a little more trouble with words.
   Jefferies finished his stint as a prosecution witness this week
by saying for the first time in three GAF Corp. stock manipulation
trials that he assumed the alleged scheme was directed by GAF
Chairman Samuel J. Heyman.
   Defense lawyers pounced on the surprise statement as an example
of numerous discrepancies in testimony by the former Los Angeles
broker, who cut a deal with federal prosecutors in exchange for
lenient treatment.
   And in an article in the December issue of Esquire magazine,
Jefferies bluntly states that Heyman ordered the alleged
manipulation and derides the quality of the prosecution.
   ``It's such a chickenshit case,'' Jefferies is quoted as saying.
   Based on information from Jefferies, the government charged GAF,
two subsidiaries and vice chairman James T. Sherwin with stock
manipulation and other crimes. They allegedly tried to boost Union
Carbide Corp.'s share price in 1986 shortly before selling a large
block of Carbide shares.
   Jefferies has waffled, sweated, stammered and failed to
recollect during lengthystretches of testimony, especially under
cross-examination from GAF lawyer Arthur Liman. The first two
trials ended in mistrials.
   ``It's very difficult for any man to go through that many
examinations for that long,'' Jefferies' lawyer, James Linn, said
Friday. ``He is frustrated and very tired of it. I think it showed
a little.''
   But, Linn said, ``there's no real discrepancy on his fundamental
story'' that Sherwin called Jefferies in late October 1986 and
asked him to raise Carbide stock to close at $22 a share.
   Barring another mistrial, Jefferies is done testifying. He also
appeared at the trial that convicted investor Paul Bilzerian and
provided information for charges against speculator Salim B. Lewis,
who pleaded guilty to stock manipulation on the eve of his trial.
   In exchange, Jefferies pleaded guilty to two felonies. After the
government praised his assistance, he was spared jail, sentenced to
probation and fined $250,000. The multimillionaire is running a
golf clinic for youngsters in Aspen, Colo.
   Jefferies also has a home in Palm Springs, Calif., where he
returned Friday. He didn't immediately return telephone calls
seeking comment.
   In all three GAF trials, defense lawyers have attacked
Jefferies' credibility, calling him an admitted felon testifying to
save his skin.
   ``The crux of this trial is whether Boyd Jefferies is or is not
a truth teller,'' Sherwin's lawyer, Stephen Kaufman, said in a
closed session in U.S. District Judge May Johnson Lowe's chambers
this week.
   In the Esquire article, Jefferies said that after he was
implicated by now-jailed speculator Ivan Boesky he remembered
thinking, ``If they're going to bring me down for something like
this, I'm going to bring down a lot of other people with me.''
   Jefferies also was quoted as saying about Heyman and the alleged
GAF manipulation: ``The whole thing was all Sam's idea. Sherwin
doesn't even go to the bathroom without Sam telling him to.''
   Liman read some of the quotations in court and Jefferies said he
couldn't recall having made them.
   Jefferies testified in the second trial that during
conversations with Heyman in Tuscon, Ariz., he had no indication
Sherwin was acting on Heyman's instructions. He said the same thing
this Tuesday.
   But on Wednesday Jefferies suddenly said Heyman called him to
see if he could talk to Sherwin ``and discuss something that Mr.
Heyman knew was illegal and he did not want to have any
association.''
   ``Mr. Heyman is smart,'' he testified. ``He knows the conniving
and the way to do an illegal transaction and not provide any
trail.''
   On Thursday, he wavered, saying he merely assumed Heyman knew
and had instructed Sherwin what to do. ``I felt that Mr. Sherwin
and I had been set up by Mr. Heyman,'' he said.
   Heyman has not been charged, although he was named in the second
trial as an unindicted co-conspirator. It was unclear what effect
Jefferies' latest testimony would have on the case, though some
lawyers believe it could help Sherwin's chances of acquittal but
hurt GAF.

<HEAD>CBS-Fox Sues MGM-UA Over Home Videos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS-Fox Co. has charged in a $50 million lawsuit
that MGM-UA Communications Co. violated an agreement that gives
CBS-Fox the right to distribute MGM-UA movies on videocassette.
   The lawsuit stems from the settlement of an earlier dispute that
called for the home video rights of each movie released by MGM-UA
to be split alternately between CBS-Fox and MGM-UA's own video
distribution company.
   CBS-Fox claims that MGM-UA reneged on the agreement by
manipulating the release date of movies to deny CBS-Fox successful
and lucrative films like ``Poltergeist II'' and ``Running Scared.''
   The lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, seeks $50 million in damages from MGM-UA.
   ``We're not happy with the deal,'' said James Lopes, a spokesman
for CBS-Fox in New York. He declined to comment further on the
litigation.
   A call to William Jones, the general counsel for MGM-UA, was not
immediately returned.
   CBS-Fox, which is owned jointly by 20th Century-Fox Video Inc.
and CBS Inc., distributes movies for home viewing. It entered into
an agreement in 1981 with United Artists to distribute all its
movies.
   Shortly thereafter, UA was acquired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Film
Co., which had its own videocassette distribution house.
   CBS-Fox first sued MGM-UA in 1983, claiming the merger resulted
in a violation of its original contract with UA. That lawsuit
resulted in the agreement which CBS-Fox now claims MGM-UA is not
following.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kloster Cruise Ltd., owner of Royal Viking and
Norwegian Cruise lines, said Friday it had signed a definitive
agreement to buy Royal Cruise Line, the San Francisco-based owner
of two luxury ships.
   The purchase price was not disclosed.
   The agreement calls for Kloster to acquire Royal Cruise Line,
which owns the 1,052-passenger Crown Odyssey and the 472-passenger
Golden Odyssey, while leaving Royal Cruise's sales, marketing and
operational headquarters in San Francisco as a separate division.
   P.S. Panagopoulos, chairman and owner of Royla Cruise, will
remain with the company.
   Kloster, based in suburban Coral Gables, already operates 10
ships through its Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Viking Line
divisions. Most of them offer Caribbean cruises out of the Port of
Miami, but some sail worldwide.
   Kloster Chairman Trygve Hegnar noted that Royal Cruise ``has a
strong identity in the luxury end of the market'' and said the
acquisition ``will greatly broaden and enhance our offer of cruise
products, covering the whole range from the mass market to the very
top of the luxury market.''
   Hegnar also said Royal Cruise's Greek heritage and
well-established European cruise program gives Kloster the chance
to increase its presence in Europe, ``which is an integral part of
our expansion strategy for the 1990s.''

<HEAD>Colt Says It Has Found Possible Buyer for Firearms Division</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven months after putting its firearms
division up for sale, Colt Industries Inc. said Friday it had found
a prospective buyer.
   New York-based Colt didn't identify the potential buyer for its
two manufacturing plants in Hartford and West Hartford, but there
was an indication workers who have been on strike since January
1986 against Colt might become the new owners with state assistance.
   In making its announcement about a possible buyer, Colt warned
950 employees who have replaced the striking unionized workers that
they face dismissal in January.
   ``Negotiations among the parties involved in possible
acquisition of Colt Firearms Division of Colt Industries are
continuing with all due dispatch and vigor, and all the parties are
pleased at the progress of the talks to date. Past that, we have no
further comment,'' the United Auto Workers Region 9A said in a
prepared statement.
   The statement was signed by Region 9A director Phil Wheeler and
assistant director Robert Madore, the two leaders in the bitter
strike at the firearms plants that began on Jan. 24, 1986.
   The workers went on strike after failing to obtain a new
contract. About 1,050 workers had gone 10 months without a new
contract before striking. Since then, some of the workers have
crossed the picket lines and others have found new jobs, leaving
about 800 on the picket line. Replacement workers were hired to
fill their jobs.
   Sturm, Ruger Co. of Fairfield, which had expressed an interest
in the firearms division, said it was defenitely out the the
picture.
   ``It's certainly not us,'' said Steve Sanetti, general counsel
for Sturm, Ruger. He declined further comment, citing a
confidentialy agreement signed by his company when it considered
making a bid.
   Officials at Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., a division of Tompkins PLC in
Srpingfield, Mass., weren't immediately available for comment.
Richard Carr, president of Tompkins' U.S. unit has said his company
would consider purchase of the Colt division.
   The value of the potential deal wasn't disclosed by
privately-held Colt Industries, but analysts have said a sale could
fetch Colt betwen $150 million to $200 million. The analysts have
estimated that Colt Firearms has annual sales at between $75
million to $100 million, with a profit margin at about 17 percent.
   In a short announcement, Colt Industries said it had advised
employees that the company ``is near agreement to sell the assets
of the (firearm) division.''
   If the sale goes through, Colt said its two gun-manufacturing
plants would stop production on or about Jan. 16, 1990. Effective
with the halt of production, all workers will be dismissed, Colt
said.
   The company said, however, that the new owner plans to resume
production at the plants and ``many of the affected employees will
be contacted by the prospective buyer during the next several weeks
concerning the availability of jobs.''
   Jon Sandberg, a spokesman for Gov. William A. O'Neill, said the
governor's office was following the developments. Sandberg said the
governor was working to keep the Colt jobs in Connecticut, but
declined further comment.
   Colt was founded in Hartford in 1836 by Samuel Colt, who
invented the revolver. The firearms division is a leading
manufacturer of handguns and rifles for military and commercial
uses. Products include the well-known Colt .45 pistol, the King
Cobra Magnum revolver, AR-15 sport rifle and the M-16 military
rifle.
   The company lost its contract with the Army to produce the M-16
last year. The loss of that contract, coupled with the strike,
apparently figured in Colt's decision to sell the division,
although company officials have denied that the lost contract was a
factor.
   Analysts also have estimated that Colt's debt at around $1.8
billion. The bulk of the debt was incurred when management mounted
a $660 million leveraged buyout in 1988, analysts have said.
   When the company announced in April that it was seeking a buyer,
the union and firearms division management in Connecticut combined
forces with the state of Connecticut and private investors to make
a bid for the business.
   In the past two years, more than 300 U.S. companies have been
acquired by their employees, according to Joseph R. Blasi, a
business professor and expert on employee ownership.
   The largest employee buyout on record is the one engineered by
workers at Avis, who paid $1.75 billion for the car rental company.

<HEAD>Skinner Warns Against High-Debt Airline Takeovers, Re-Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner on
Friday reiterated his department's opposition to high levels of
debt in airline takeovers, which have swept the industry this year.
   ``Many recapitalizations are good. They put new blood into the
company; they set standards for performance,'' Skinner told an
airline industry gathering in New York. He added, however, that he
is concerned that excessive debt resulting from takeovers could
negatively affect an airline's safety.
   While conceding that some foreign investment is essential,
Skinner said, ``We have to make sure that national security is not
compromised'' by foreign control of U.S. airlines.
   Under U.S. law, foreign airlines aren't allowed to own more than
25 percent of the voting stock of domestic carriers.
   Last month, Skinner used his authority to force KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, the foreign partner in the $3.65 billion buyout of
Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc., to cut its $400 million
investment by $225 million.
   Despite his concern about takeovers, Skinner said Friday he
doesn't need the new authority to deal with buyouts that a bill in
Congress would give him.
   The House recently passed a bill to require government rejection
of any airline takeover that might affect safety, hinder
competition, cut a carrier's size, affect jobs or result in foreign
control of an airline.
   Under the legislation, now before the Senate, the transportation
secretary would determine whether transactions meet the standards
before they are completed. He also would have the power to approve
any airline merger if he believes it is in the public interest.
   Skinner said he would recommend that President Bush veto the
bill if it is sent to him. The House vote exceeded the two-thirds
majority necessary to override a veto.
   The transportation chief also criticized new proposals in
Congress to re-regulate the airline industry.
   ``The concept of re-regulation is not a concept I agree with,''
Skinner told the airline executives and analysts.
   He said a study of airline competition by his department, due to
be completed in January, will show that such drastic action is not
warranted _ although there are small ``pockets'' of
anti-competitiveness.
   Skinner urged the airlines to forge the same sort of cooperation
between labor and management that exists in the auto industry.
   ``The days of adversarial striking, to the degree it has
occurred in the past, are over,'' he said.
   He didn't specifically mention the strike against Eastern
Airlines, which has continued since early March although the
carrier has hired replacement workers. Skinner and Bush have
refused to intervene in the strike, as the unions have asked them
to do.

<TEXT>
   The federal agency that regulates the nation's
futures exchanges said Friday it will ask those exchanges to
restrict the controversial practice of dual trading.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also released its
long-awaited study of dual trading, which involves traders who
execute trades for themselves and their customers on the same day.
   The study found dual traders are not ``a critical ingredient in
providing liquidity and low-cost trade execution.''
   Critics of dual trading, which is not illegal, claim it poses
conflict-of-interest problems for traders who might try to make a
profit trading for themselves ahead of their customers.
   This practice, known as front-running, is banned.
   Front-running is among the many fraud schemes alleged in the
indictments of more than 40 traders at the nation's two-largest
futures exchanges in Chicago this past summer.
   Based on the study, as well as the Chicago indictments, the CFTC
said its staff was preparing ``proposed rules that would require
exchanges to restrict dual trading on a provision, phased-in
basis.''
   CFTC Chief Economist Steven Manaster said, however, that
developing those rules ``will be a lengthy process.''
   Legislation that would severely limit dual trading is pending
before Congress.
   ``Dual trading exists in all markets,'' the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange said in a prepared statement, adding that the exchange
``after its own study, has proposed to deal with any real or
perceived problems with dual trading through the enhancement of the
audit trail. Both the House and Senate have also adiopted this
approach.''
   An audit trail is an anti-fraud device to reconstruct a trade to
determine when it occurred and who was involved.
   ``We will review the CFTC's report on dual trading and make
comments to any proposed rules at the appropriate time,'' the CME
statement concluded.
   Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods
at a specified price at a certain time in the future. Futures
contracts are used by producers of such commodities as soybeans or
gold to lock in a favorable price down the road.
   And speculators, in turn, buy and sell those contracts to profit
from constantly changing price differences.
   Supporters of dual trading claim it helps keep trading costs
down and keeps the markets liquid when there is little trading
especially in small, low-volume markets.
   ``It had been argued that dual traders might be superior
providers of liquidity or that dual traders might be superior in
terms providing customer service and on that basis were kind of
super traders _ they were absolutely essential to whatever was
going on in these markets,'' said Manaster.
   But he noted the 47-page study, conducted by the CFTC's Division
of Economic Analysis, found that the ``vast majority'' of dual
traders tend to specialize in trading either for themselves or for
their customers. Dual trading is really a sideline for most floor
traders, constituting only about 10 percent or less of their
business.
   The study also found that:
   _There is no statistical support for claims that dual trading
increases in low-volume months;
   _Dual traders ``do not, on average'' get better quality trades
for their cusrtomers than brokers who trade only for customers.
   _Dual traders do not help make the market any more liquid than
``exclusive traders,'' or those who don't engage in dual trading.
   ``On the basis of the study, I think we have a reasonable idea
of what may happen and in particular, dual traders are not a
unique, super trader and it seems reasonable that their
contribution to the market organization could be substituted for by
exclusive traders or brokers,'' said Manaster.

<HEAD>Hewlett-Packard's Profit Nearly Flat in Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. reported Friday
that its profit was nearly flat in its fiscal fourth quarter,
depressed by its acquisition of Apollo Computer Inc. and costs
associated with the California earthquake.
   The computer, electronics and instruments company said it earned
$246 million, or $1.04 a share, in the three months ended Oct. 31,
up only 1 percent from $243 million, or $1.03 a share, a year
earlier.
   The Apollo purchase and earthquake costs reduced net earnings
for the quarter by about 14 cents a share, Hewlett-Packard said.
   The flat earnings occurred despite a 25 percent increase in
fourth-quarter revenue to $3.37 billion from $2.70 billion.
   The company paid $476 million for Apollo, a large maker of
computer workstations.
   Among the effects of the purchase was a one-time $6 million
charge stmming from employee payouts in Hewlett-Packard's
profit-sharing plan. The payout was extended to Apollo employees.
   Hewlett-Packard also posted a $9 million charge to cover costs
connected with the earthquake that rattled Northern California on
Oct. 17, killing 66 people and causing $7 billion in damage.
   The costs included repair and cleanup from the quake, said Nancy
Colvert, a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard. The company doesn't
expect any further charges connected with the quake.
   Orders for the fourth quarter totaled $3.14 billion, up 20
percent from $2.61 billion in the same period last year.
   For the entire fiscal year, net profit edged up 2 percent to
$829 million, or $3.52 a share, from $816 million, or $3.36 a
share, the previous year.

   The dollar finished mixed Friday in a quiet
session with traders lacking any incentive to buy or sell heavily.
   Gold bullion prices rose.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $394.60 a troy ounce, $3.20 higher than
Thursday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted an ounce of
gold at $394.25 as of 4 p.m. EST, up $2.95 from Thursday's late bid.
   ``There was not much activity today'' in the dollar, currency
dealer John McCarthy said.
   McCarthy, who is with the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank's office in
New York, said currency dealers paid more attention to buying West
German marks than to trading dollars.
   Demand for marks has increased as currency investors speculate
that West German economic growth will accelerate due to closer ties
with East Germany.
   Traders said news that U.S. housing starts rebounded 12 percent
in October from September's seven-year low failed to evoke much of
a response in the currency markets.
   The dollar ended lower against most major currencies in U.S.
trading after a mixed performance overseas.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 143.98 Japanese yen from
143.85 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 144.15
yen. By the time trading was done in New York, the dollar was
quoted at 144.25 yen, unchanged from Thursday's late level.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.5705 from $1.5805 late
Thursday. The pound weakened further in later New York trading,
falling to $1.5670 from $1.5755 on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates included: 1.8410 West German marks, down from 1.8427;
1.6307 Swiss francs, down from 1.6326; 6.2630 French francs, down
from 6.2725; 1,355.00 Italian lire, down from 1,357.25; and 1.16945
Canadian dollars, up from 1.16875.
   Selected late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with late
Thursday's quotes included: 1.8410 West German marks, up from
1.8375; 1.6315 Swiss francs, up from 1.6290; 6.2590 French francs,
up from 6.2550; 2.0770 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0750; 1,353.50
Italian lire, down from 1,354.00; and 1.1697 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1700.
   Precious metals prices moved higher.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $392.25 a troy ounce, down
from $393 late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $391.50, down from
late Thursday's bid of $392.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.59 to close at $392.21.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.61 a
troy ounce, up from $5.60 late Thursday. On New York's Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.672 a troy ounce,
up from Thursday's settlement of $5.582.

<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures prices rose broadly Friday, supported by
continued investor buying of gold, silver and platinum, and by
supply fears in the palladium market linked to reports of problems
at Soviet nickel refinery.
   Gold closed near its high for the week, prompting predictions by
analysts that it will test the psychologically important
$400-an-ounce level next week.
   On other commodity markets, copper sank to four-month lows;
energy futures rose; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and
grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $3.10 to $3.90 higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in December at
$395.80 a troy ounce; silver futures finished 8.7 cents to 9.6
cents higher on the Commodity Exchange with December at $5.685 a
troy ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures settled
$5.20 to $6 higher with January at $526.60 a troy ounce; palladium
ended $3.25 to $4 higher with December at $145.60 a troy ounce.
   The latest gains fit with a bullish trend in precious metals
prices that began last month and which analysts have attributed
largely to buying by investors fleeing the turbulent stock market.
   The rally, which began on the London market before the New York
markets opened, defied expectations for a drop in prices following
Thursday's weak finish.
   ``What impressed me is that the market wasn't taken lower
abroad,'' said analyst Craig Sloane of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. ``I felt everything followed from that.''
   The palladium market led a late surge in the metals markets
following news that a gas pipeline feeding a major Soviet nickel
refinery had exploded.
   The Soviet Union is the world's largest producer of palladium, a
white metal similar to platinum that is a by-product of nickel
refining.
   Copper futures fell sharply on the Commodities Exchange,
continuing a downward trend linked to an improving supply outlook.
Traders expect the London Metal Exchange's weekly stocks report on
Monday to show an increase in the exchange's warehouse stocks of
copper.
   Copper futures finished 2.5 cents to 4.6 cents lower with
December at $1.089 a pound, the lowest daily settlement price since
July 21.
   Energy futures rose on the New York Merc, led by strong gains in
the gasoline and heating oil markets.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 7 cents
higher with December at $19.91 a barrel; heating oil was .46 cent
to .60 cent higher with December at 59.27 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent to .67 cent higher with December at 51.95
cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange ahead of a monthly Agriculture Department report that
showed 3 percent fewer cattle on feedlots Nov. 1 than on the same
date a year ago.
   That number was near market expectations but the report also
showed an unexpectedly large number of feedlot placements last
month, which was expected to prompt fairly heavy selling of live
cattle futures when trading resumes Monday.
   Live cattle settled .07 cent lower to .20 cent higher with
December at 74.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .10 cent higher with November at 83.15 cents a pound; hog
futures were .30 cent to .95 cent higher with December at 49.97
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .65 cent higher
with February at 64.17 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices finished mixed on the Chicago
Board of Trade after a dull trading session.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 2{ cents higher with December at
$4.10 a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to \ cent higher with
December at $2.40 a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent higher
with December at $1.47{ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 1{

<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. on Friday announced a
shareholder-pleasing plan to spend excess cash on the biggest
single stock repurchase program in U.S. corporate history, $10
billion over five years.
   The action, coupled with a 15 percent increase in dividends, was
aimed at satisfying investors who complained the company has not
been using the money it generates to benefit shareholders.
   ``We've looked at all the alternatives and reached the
conclusion that GE stock is the best investment we can make,'' John
F. Welch Jr., GE's chairman, said in a statement.
   GE rose $2 a share to $59.50 on the New York Stock Exchange,
helping to support the overall stock market. The stock had already
risen about $3 a share earlier in the week on speculation of some
kind of announcement to benefit shareholders.
   The repurchase authorized by the board of directors would amount
to about 20 percent of GE's stock at current prices. Taking stock
off the market benefits shareholders because profits are spread
over fewer shares.
   ``This affirms to us that the company really believes that the
stock is cheap,'' said Robert Spremulli, an investment officer for
the College Retirement Equities Fund, a major pension fund and GE
stockholder.
   GE's $10 billion total buyback is by far the biggest announced
at one time, but it is spread out over five years. Other companies
have announced a succession of shorter-term buybacks that total
billions of dollars. The closest in a single announcement was
Atlantic Richfield Co. with $4 billion in 1985.
   GE's announcement caps a decade of massive and successful
restructuring in which the company has sold off numerous businesses
and bought others in order to focus on 13 key industries, from
lighting, broadcasting and medical equipment to financial services,
aircraft engines and plastics.
   Welch, the chairman, said GE was not ruling out another
multibillion-dollar acquisition in the 1990s, but he said the
company was much more likely to stick with the businesses it has,
adding bits and pieces to them.
   The only acquisition that could halt the buyback, he said, would
be one on the order of RCA, which GE bought for $6.4 billion in
1986. That is, ``a massive acquisition that fit exactly, right down
the pipeline.''
   GE said shares would be repurchased in the open market with
funds from a combination of borrowings and cash generated by its
businesses. It said the company reserved the right to halt or slow
the buyback at any time.
   GE said it had reviewed the share repurchase plan with the
rating debt-rating agencies and that they had confirmed GE's Triple
A debt rating.
   At Moody's Investors Service Inc., analyst Alfred Pastore said,
``They're pretty sharp people and we feel they're going to do the
right thing with the money, not spend it foolishly.''
   The huge buyback provoked questions about whether GE was being
too conservative with its money when it could be using it to buy
other companies or build existing businesses.
   But analyst Linda Shuman of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
said GE had come under heat from institutional investors for the
exact opposite reason, putting money into risky investments instead
of returning it to shareholders.
   ``There's inherent risk in acquisitions: the risk that you
overpay, the risk that it doesn't work out,'' she said.
   ``They will still have enough funds available to grow
internally,'' said Russell Leavitt of Salomon Brothers Inc. ``In
the products that GE is involved in, I think they will remain fully
competitive on a world scale.''
   The dividend increase brings the quarterly dividend to 47 cents
a share, and GE said it would keep raising dividends in line with
increases in earnings per share.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices slumped Friday as traders sold to
reduce supplies after overstocking during a recent series of
government auctions.
   The bond market's benchmark 30-year Treasury issue dropped 25-32
point, or $7.81 for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which
rises when the price falls, went up to 7.93 percent from 7.86
percent late Thursday.
   Other maturities of government bonds posted more modest declines.
   Economists also said a report showing a sharp rebound in
residential construction contributed to the drop. The government
said housing starts jumped 12 perent in October to their highest
level in almost three years.
   William Sullivan, a money market economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said the report ``showed a much stronger rebound in
housing than expected which seemed to suggest that perhaps the
economy wasn't as weak as assumed.''
   Bond traders have been hoping that weakness in the economy would
induce the Federal Reserve Board to pursue an increasingly generous
credit policy, leading to lower interest rates. Falling rates
enhance the value of fixed-income securities.
   Steven A. Wood, an economist at BankAmerica Capital Markets
Group, said selling was spurred by the huge volume of securities
held by traders following government refinancing auctions of
Treasury issues in the last week and a half.
   ``That's beginning to weigh down on a lot of people's hands,''
Wood said. ``They just don't want to own that much. We saw some
selling to try to get that resupply redistributed.''
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues edged down by 3-32 point to 7-32
point, intermediate maturities were 11-32 point to 13-32 point
lower, and long-term issues were off 25-32 point, according to
figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   In corporate trading, industrials were down. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, fell 0.75 to 338.72.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, declined 3.51 to 1,193.79.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 93[, down 1-16. The average yield
to maturity rose to 7.29 percent from 7.28 percent late Thursday.
   In the secondary market, yields on three-month Treasury bills
rose to 7.94 percent as the discount gained 1 basis point at 7.68
percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 7.84 percent as the
discount increased 4 basis points to 7.45 percent. Yields on newly
issued one-year bills fell to 7.66 percent as the discount lost one
basis point from Thursday's auction level at 7.15 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8] percent, down from 8{ percent late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures moved higher Friday in
anticipation of the upcoming OPEC meeting and increased demand
during the winter months.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 5 cents to $19.91 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, adding to a 19 cent gain on
Thursday.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the December
contract for home heating oil advanced 0.48 cent to 59.27 cents a
gallon following a 1.66 cents rise the previous session.
   And wholesale gasoline for December delivery picked up 0.64 cent
to close at 51.95 cents a gallon after rising 0.70 cent on Thursday.
   ``We had a one-two punch coming in here,'' said analyst Madison
Galbraith of Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Galbraith said the market expected the return of colder weather
to many parts of the nation to increase the demand for home heating
oil, which is refined from crude.
   But traders also were looking ahead to meetings of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries beginning next week
in Vienna, Galbraith said.
   The market anticipated that the 13-member oil cartel might take
steps to tighten production and raise prices, and investors bought
up oil so they would not be caught short in the event of a new OPEC
agreement.
   Galbraith said buying remained strong throughout Friday's
session.

<HEAD>Lockheed to Take $300 Million Loss on Anti-Sub Plane, May Show Loss
for Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Design changes on a new anti-submarine
patrol plane will force Lockheed Corp. to report a pre-tax loss of
about $300 million in the fourth quarter and possibly a loss for
the year, Lockheed said Friday.
   The big aerospace company has been building fixed-wing maritime
surveillance planes since World War II for the Navy, which plans to
spend between $4 billion and $5 billion to buy 125 of the new P-7A
planes.
   Lockheed said the cost of developing the P-7A had risen because
its design will be less like that of its predecessor, Lockheed's
P-3C Orion, than expected.
   Despite big changes in the wings, body and engine _ the new
plane's wingspan is 7 feet longer than the old one, for example,
and top takeoff weight is 156,600 pounds, up from 139,700 pounds _
the company had hoped it would be able to keep many parts of the
structure unchanged.
   ``We originally had thought that something over 50 percent of
the structure might be common to the P-3,'' said Lockheed spokesman
Jim Ragsdale.
   Stress analysis proved different. ``We don't know what the
actual percentage is going to be, but it's going to be far lower
than that,'' Ragsdale said.
   Lockheed stock fell $2.12{ a share to $39.50 in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Lockheed has been building P-3s since 1962 and is to deliver the
last P-3 to the Navy in mid-1991. It had hoped to have the P-7A in
production by late 1992. Ragsdale said it was unclear how much the
design changes would delay production.
   The writeoff of about $300 million covers all the extra
development costs that are expected over the next several years,
and Lockheed expects to show a profit once production of the P-7As
gets under way, said Daniel M. Tellep, the company's chairman.
   Tellep said in a statement that the exact amount of the writeoff
wouldn't be known until after more studies and review by the Navy.
   He didn't say how long that would take. But in a memo from the
aerospace company's Burbank facilities to P-7A workers, Lockheed
said it would immediately launch a three-month to five-month
reassessment of the program.
   ``The P7-A is now viewed as an almost new design,'' the memo
said.
   ``Some activities will be temporarily suspended until revised
plans can be set in place and approved by the customer,'' Lockheed
told the workers. ``We are confident the program will be continued
and will meet its objectives.''
   For its third quarter ending Sept. 31, Lockheed lost $32 million
on sales of $2.1 billion, compared to a profit of $123 million on
sales of $2.3 billion for the same quarter a year earlier. For the
first nine months of the year, Lockheed earned $108 million on
sales of $6.6 billion, compared to $333 million on sales of $7.2
billion in the same period in 1988.

   Southwestern Bell Corp. directors elected
Edward E. Whitacre Jr. on Friday as chairman and chief executive
officer of the telecommunications company.
   Whitacre will succeed Zane E. Barnes, who will retire Dec. 31
after leading the company 16 years.
   Whitacre, 48, was chosen president and chief operating officer
to succeed Barnes in June 1988. Since October 1988, he has been
responsible for operations involving the corporation's five major
subsidiaries.
   ``He's done an outstanding job during the transition, and my
confidence has been reconfirmed time and time again,'' Barnes, 67,
said in a prepared statement. ``When Ed's succession was announced,
I said his experience and unique leadership qualities were
precisely what Southwestern Bell needs in today's marketplace.''
   Whitacre, born in Ennis, Texas, started with the five-state
Southwestern Bell system in 1963. The corporation serves more than
9.5 million businesses and homes in Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas,
Arkansas and Texas.
   Gerald D. Blatherwick, 53, vice chairman; Robert G. Pope. 53,
vice chairman and chief financial officer, and James D. Ellis, 46,
senior vice president and general counsel, were named by
Southwestern Bell to work with Whitacre in the chairman's office.
   Southwestern Bell, one of the nation's leading suppliers of
pagers, is also a major supplier of cellular telephone service in a
dozen market areas. Its sales in 1988 were $8.45 billion.

   The stock market gained ground Friday with a
boost from news of General Electric's plans to buy back as much as
$10 billion of its shares.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 17.00 to 2,652.66,
finishing the week with a net gain of 27.05 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
766 up, 682 down and 519 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 151.02 million
shares, against 148.37 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 178.23 million shares.
   General Electric helped stir revived interest in blue-chip
issues, reporting plans for its repurchase of stock over the next
five years and an increase in the quarterly dividend from 41 cents
a share to 47 cents.
   John F. Welch, the company's chairman, also forecast
``double-digit growth for share earnings into the 1990s.''
   GE shares climbed 2 to 59{ as the day's most active Big
Board-listed issue.
   Hewlett-Packard, meanwhile, gained 3\ to 44{ on the company's
report of slightly higher quarterly earnings.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose 2 to 99[; Philip Morris \ to 41]; Exxon } to 46\, and
Union Carbide | to 23~.
   The session got off to a sluggish start as interest rates rose
in the bond market. Prices of long-term government bonds dropped
more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing their yields
to the 7.92 percent-7.97 percent range.
   The Commerce Department reported an unexpectedly strong 12
percent increase in housing starts for October.
   The figures on new construction are notoriously subject to
erratic swings, however, and have seldom exerted much lasting
influence on the stock market in recent years.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet rose ] to 42~ in active trading. The stock fell
7} points Wednesday and Thursday after the company said it expects
to post lower earnings in 1990 as it revamps its credit-services
business.
   Land's End gained 2\ to 26|. Late Thursday the company reported
flat earnings for its most recent fiscal quarter.
   But whatever disappointment that news engendered was apparently
offset when at least one brokerage firm repeated its favorable view
of the stock.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $9.77 billion, or 0.29
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .53 to 189.28.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.87 to 389.92, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.03 at 341.61.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
climbed 1.44 to 456.72. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 373.35, up .84.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   L.J. Hooker Corp., unable to find a buyer for
its B. Altman department stores, said Friday it would close six of
the chain's seven branches.
   Hooker said the move, which will include the company's flagship
Manhattan store, was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
overseeing the company's reorganization.
   Hooker is owned by the Australian developer Hooker Corp., which
has been unable to handle its massive debt load and been forced to
liquidate itself.
   Last month, L.J. Hooker said it had received a $409 million cash
offer from an investor group for the company's three regional
shopping malls, shopping centers, a large Atlanta office building
and undeveloped land in several states. It also included L.J.
Hooker International Inc., a commercial real estate brokerage.
   The offer did not include the Altman stores, and Hooker had said
it would close the chain if it did not find a buyer for them by
Friday.
   ``We just couldn't wait any longer, given our fiduciary
responsibility to the company's creditors and other business
entities,'' said Sanford C. Sigoloff, Hooker's chief executive.
   Hooker said the Altman store in a Hooker mall outside Cincinnati
would remain open. The company also owns the Bonwit Teller
specialty store chain, and has said it would keep those stores open.
   Hooker had been trying to sell the Altman branches while several
other big U.S. department stores also were on the block.
   Canada's Campeau Corp., another developer that has run into
financial trouble because of its retail acquisitions, plans to sell
its Bloomingdale's chain. Meanwhile, BAT Industries PLC plans to
sell its Marshall Field and Saks Fifth Avenue chains as part of its
defense against an unwanted takeover bid in Britain.
   Retail industry analysts have said Hooker and Campeau took on
too much debt and underestimated the volatility of the U.S.
retailing industry when they made their acquisitions.
   Campeau Chairman Robert Campeau was forced to surrender control
of his company to fellow developers Olympia &amp; York recently in
return for financial aid to keep his company afloat. Campeau paid
$3.4 billion for Allied Stores Corp. and $6.6 billion for Federated
Department Stores Inc., going heavily into debt to finance the two
deals.
   The retailing industry has had a generally disappointing
performance in recent years, and Hooker and Campeau stores have
been unable to generate the cash flow the companies needed to pay
their debts.
   When both companies made their acquisitions, analysts said the
firms were more interested in the real estate they acquired rather
than the retailing businesses.
   The investors bidding for most of Hooker's assets are led by the
Shidler Group and the Simpson Organization Inc. The group was
assembled by the London-based investment banking company Hoare
Govett, a subsidiary of Security Pacific Corp.
   Besides the Manhattan store, located in a landmark building
across from the Empire State Building, the Altman branches being
closed are in White Plains and Manhasset, two New York City
suburbs; Paramus and Short Hills, N.J.; and St. Davids, Pa.

   LIN Broadcasting Corp. said Thursday it has
scheduled a Jan. 12 special meeting for its shareholders to vote on
its plan to combine its cellular phone operations with those of
BellSouth Corp., a regional telephone concern.
   New York-based LIN, which also owns television stations and a
specialty publishing business, said shareholders of record as of
the close of business Dec. 1 will be eligible to vote.
   LIN has been the target of an unwelcome takeover bid from McCaw
Cellular Communications Inc., the nation's largest cellular
operator, which already owns nearly 10 percent of LIN's stock.
   McCaw has offered $125 a share for 22 million of LIN's 54
million shares, which would give it a controlling 50.3 percent
interest in LIN. LIN has recommended that its shareholders reject
the McCaw offer.
   Under LIN's agreement with BellSouth, LIN shareholders would get
a special dividend of $42 a share, keep a stake in the new cellular
company and get stock in a new company being spun off consisting of
LIN's TV stations.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Clears Way for Restoration of Blackout Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday cleared the way
for restoration of rules designed to prevent cable TV systems from
showing syndicated programs that local TV stations also might be
showing.
   The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia could mean that TV
viewers will get fewer chances to view some of their favorite
syndicated shows starting Jan. 1.
   Syndicated shows are those not controlled by a network, but made
available by their producers to stations independently. Frequently
they are re-runs of previous network hits, like ``MASH.''
   The court upheld a 1988 decision by the Federal Communications
Commission to reinstate its so-called syndicated exclusivity rules
that the agency had lifted in 1980 to help boost the cable TV
industry.
   The rules allow local over-the-air stations to contract with
program suppliers for the exclusive rights in their broadcast areas.
   Cable operators retransmit local broadcasters' signals while
also ``importing'' the signals of national ``superstations'' such
as WTBS of Atlanta, New York City's WOR in New York and WGN from
Chicago. In some cases that means a cable system will be showing
``Green Acres,'' for instance, from a superstation as well as a
local TV station.
   Cable operator Steven J. Simmons, chairman of Simmons
Communications Inc., said in an interview last month that
broadcasters around the country have indicated they will claim
exclusvity for ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ``Who's the Boss?,''
``Wheel of Fortune,'' ``MASH,'' ``I Love Lucy,'' ``Golden Girls,''
``Donahue'' and other programs.
   Broadcasters claim program duplication reduces their audiences
and their advertising revenues, while giving broadcasters less
incentive to develop syndicated programming.
   The appeals court, in an opinion written by Chief Judge Patricia
M. Wald, denied challenges to the rules from cable companies and
industry organizations that claimed they were arbitrary and
violated federal law and cable operators' First Amendment rights.
   The petitioners also said the copmmission had not compiled
adequate statistics to back up its decision to bring back the
syndication rules.
   Wald, in a stinging rejection of the First Amendment argument,
said the cable companies were ``claiming that they have a First
Amendment right to express themselves using the copyrighted
materials of others.''
   She said the FCC ``was surely justified in concluding'' that
duplication of programming ``diverts a substantial portion of the
broadcast audience to cable.''
   ``The commission reasonably inferred that diversion lessened the
value of the programming by lowering advertising revenues,'' Wald
wrote. She noted that cable programmers themselves boast of the
exclusive rights they have to certain programs and that ``the
evidence is that all stations, broadcast and cable, want
exclusivity.''
   Wald said the FCC was justified in changing its mind on syndex
from 1980 to 1988. During that period, the fraction of homes with
cable grew from 19 percent to 51 percent while cable advertising
revenues climbed from $45.5 million to more than $1 billion.
   John Cole, an attorney for United Video, one of the challengers,
said he was disappointed.
   National Association of Broadcasters President Edward O. Fritts
hailed the ruling as ``a victory not only for broadcasters but for
the viewing public.''

<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co., amid rumors of more
company changes, announced Thursday that earnings rose 20 percent
for the first quarter of its fiscal year, compared with the same
period last year.
   Net earnings for the quarter ended Oct. 29 were $83 million, or
64 cents per share, on sales of $1.52 billion, compared with a
profit of $69.4 million, or 54 cents per share, on sales of $1.33
billion during the same period last year.
   The results are the best fiscal first-quarter performance ever
by the nation's largest soup maker.
   The company's largest division, Campbell U.S.A., reported
quarterly earnings of $121.7 million, compared with $99.4 million
during the same period last year. Sales for the division were $918
million, an 11 percent increase over the same quarter last year,
when sales were $823.4 million.
   ``I am particularly pleased that virtually all of the gains came
from the division's established businesses, led by strong
performances in the soup, grocery, convenience meal and seafood
units,'' Herbert M. Baum, executive vice president of Campbell
Soup, said in a statement Thursday.
   Campbell International, boosted by acquisitions, reported
earnings of $19.8 million on sales of $402.8 million. Earnings were
aided by a one-time gain of $2.8 million from the sale of Arnotts
Limited's Australian pet food operations.
   The results in the international division, however, were offset
by continued poor performance by frozen food operations in the
United Kingdom and in the Italian biscuit unit, the company said.
   ``However, we are confident that our recent strengthening of top
management of those units will result in improvements by the end of
this fiscal year,'' said Edwin L. Harper, executive vice president.
   Harper and Baum, appointed Nov. 2 to assume the day-to-day
operation of the company on an interim basis after the early
retirement of President R. Gordon McGovern, have said they plan to
streamline the company and strengthen its bottom line.
   Campbell's board has been unhappy with the company's performance
in recent years and there have been rumors that it might be sold.
In September, Campbell announced a restructuring that involves the
closing of plants and the elimination of 2,800 jobs.
   Shareholders were to meet Friday in Cherry Hill for their annual
meeting and were to elect 13 board members. Analysts say
shareholders will move quickly to find a successor for McGovern,
who retired after heading the company for nine years.

<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC on Thursday announced a
$884 million plan to expand North Sea oil and gas processing at its
onshore complex at Grangemouth in Scotland and to increase ethylene
production there.
   BP said $489 million of the new investment would be spent on
enlarging its Grangemouth processing plant that separates oil and
gas from the company's Forties Field in the North Sea.
   It said the other $395 million would be spent on a new plant to
increase the production of ethylene. Ethylene is made from gas and
is used among other things to make chemicals.
   BP's activities at Grangemouth near the Scottish capital of
Edinburgh include the processing and export of North Sea oil and
gas products, oil refining and the manufacture of chemicals and
plastics.
   In June, BP announced plans to spend $255 million to replace its
Forties oil pipeline with a bigger one able to handle up to 900,000
barrels a day.
   On Nov. 2, Mobil Oil Co. Ltd. announced plans to spend $474
million on building a North Sea gas pipeline and onshore processing
plant at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland. The Mobil Corp.
subsidiary said the 210-mile pipeline will carry gas to the plant
from Mobil's Beryl oil and gas field in the North Sea.

   Telecommunications Inc., the nation's largest
cable TV system operator, on Thursday reported a third-quarter loss
of $73.9 million, citing increased interest expenses and losses of
affiliates.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, TCI's net loss equaled 21 cents
per share on revenue of $826.5 million. That compared with earnings
of $63.7 million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $624 million
for the same period in 1988.
   Losses for the nine-month period that ended Sept. 30 totaled
$188.9 million, or 54 cents per share, compared with a profit of
$34.5 million, or 10 cents per share, for the same period last year.
   Revenue for the nine months was $2.2 billion, compared with $1.7
million in 1988.
   The Denver-based company said the losses were due primarily
lower sales gains, increased interest expenses and increased losses
of affiliates.
   Operating income before depreciation and amortization totaled
$312.2 million for the third quarter and $830.4 million for the
first nine months, compared with $244.2 million in the third
quarter and $666.7 million in the first nine months of 1988.

   Sooner Federal Savings and Loan Association,
Oklahoma's largest thrift, was declared insolvent Thursday and was
added to the Resolution Trust Corp. conservatorship program.
   The company will continue operating as Sooner Federal Savings
Association under a managing agent appointed by the RTC while the
agency negotiates a permanent resolution for the troubled thrift.
   Sooner Federal had about $1.7 billion in assets and $1.2 billion
in 171,292 deposit accounts.
   It was declared insolvent by the Office of Thrift Supervision
and its deposits, assets and certain liabilities were transferred
to a newly chartered federal mutual institution.
   At its annual meeting last month, Sooner Chairman George Bragg
said the thrift was seeking a total of $250 million in new capital.
It requested $180 million in government assistance and planned to
raise $72 million in the private sector.
   The thrift, losing $1 million a month, had an $84 million
negative net worth as of June 30. Sooner Federal's stock plunged
from the $17 range more than a year ago to the 12- to 15-cent range
in recent weeks. It ended its fiscal year June 30 with a net loss
of $128.3 million.

<TEXT>
   The percentage of mergers funded by junk
bonds dropped by more than half in the first nine months of the
year, Mergers &amp; Acquisitions magazine said Thursday.
   Junk bonds, which many buyers have viewed with caution in recent
months, were used to finance only 8.5 percent of the $133.3 billion
worth of mergers in the first three quarters of the year, said
Martin Sikora, editor of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, which says it has
followed 39,000 deals since 1979.
   In the first nine months of last year, junk bonds were sold to
raise 19.5 percent of the $132.9 billion worth of deals, the
Philadelphia-based magazine said.
   More than $11.3 billion worth of junk bonds were sold as part of
mergers in the first nine months of 1989, while nearly $25.9
billion were sold to finance acquisitions in the same period last
year.
   Owners of junk, or low-grade, bonds accept a higher risk of
default in exchange for the high yields offered by the securities.

and also for another investigating Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., in
an unrelated case. Bennett was hired earlier this year for yet a
third committee investigation.
   Bennett was away from home for the evening.
   The five senators in the S&amp;L case intervened with banking
regulators examining Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.,
whose chairman, Charles H. Keating, gave the senators direct and
indirect campaign contributions in the mid-1980s.
   A standing Senate order says that Ethics Committee
investigations ``shall be conducted by outside counsel ... unless
the select committee determines not to use outside counsel.''
   The congressional watchdog Common Cause had urged the outside
counsel so that the results of the inquiry would be credible and
accepted by the public.
   Earlier this year, the House ethics committee hired an outside
counsel to press its case against then-speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
That lawyer, Richard Phelan of Chicago, became the focal point of
Wright's counter-attack to try to save his job. Wright resigned in
June.
   Over the summer, the Senate panel appointed Bennett to look into
accusations that Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., laundered
$100,000 in campaign contributions through a book contract,
according to a Durenberger announcement in August.
   First word of the decision to seek a counsel Thursday came from
CBS News.
   Meanwhile, Cranston told the Ethics Committee Thursday he
violated no laws, ethical standards or Senate rules in meeting with
federal regulators on behalf of Lincoln.
   ``The committee should determine that no further action ... is
warranted,'' the Senate Democratic whip said in a formal response,
prepared by his attorney, to a month-old inquiry by the ethics
committee.
   In an accompanying letter to its chairman and vice chairman,
Cranston said his inquiries to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
about Lincoln were ``nothing more and nothing less'' than what he
has done for other constituents ``with credible complaints about
their treatment by a federal agency.''
   Cranston is the third of five senators to respond to the ethics
panel's inquiry. The five received a total of $1.3 million in
contributions to their campaigns and other political causes from
Keating.
   Cranston's spokesman, Murray Flander, said he had no further
comment on the committee's Thursday decision. ``We have no
first-hand knowledge of it,'' Flander said.
   Telephones for spokesmen for Riegle were not answered.
   McCain said in a statement, ``I think the appointment is a
positive step, and I am confident that an investigation will
vidictae my repeated statements that I never absued my office nor
took actions that were improper.''
   DeConcini issued a statement saying, ``I welcome anything that
will establish the facts and I will cooperate fully.''
   Glenn's aide Dale Butland said in Columbus, Ohio, ``The senator
has not been notified of this.''
   Cranston was among four senators who met with then Bank Board
Chairman Edwin Gray on April 2, 1987, and five senators who met a
week later with regional officials from the board's San Francisco
office about Lincoln.
   Cranston also phoned Gray's successor, M. Danny Wall, last
spring endorsing Keating's failed attempt to sell Lincoln before
regulators obtained a court order to seize it.
   The ethics panel was asked last month by Common Cause to
initiate the inquiry after mid-level S&amp;L regulators told the House
Banking Committee their efforts to shut Lincoln down in early 1987
were thwarted by Keating's political influence.
   Regulators seized control of Lincoln only last April. They
estimate taxpayers will have to cover between $2 billion and $2.5
billion in federally insured deposits the thrift lost in the
biggest S&amp;L failure in history and have filed a $1.1 billion fraud
and racketeering suit against Keating and his associates.
   In addition, hundreds of the 22,000 bondholders who bought
high-risk debentures in Lincoln's holding Co., American Continental
Corp. of Phoenix, through Lincoln branches have sued Keating after
losing an estimated $200 million.
   Cranston received $35,000 in direct campaign gifts from Keating
and his associates. Keating also contributed another $850,000 to
California voter registration campaigns headed by Cranston's son.
And Cranston was instrumental in raising nearly $89,000 through
Keating for the California Democratic Party.
   ``I am not responsible for loss of taxpayer funds through a
delay in shutting down Lincoln or the losses of innocent California
bond investors,'' Cranston said in his letter to Sens. Howell
Heflin, D-Ala., and Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H., the chairman and vice
chairman of the ethics panel.
   ``I never attempted to derail any investigation of wrongdoing at
Lincoln, nor did I ever suggest to Chairman Gray, Chairman Wall or
any other official that an investigation be delayed,'' Cranston
said.
   DeConcini and Riegle have sent similar responses to the ethics
panel. Glenn and McCain have not yet filed formal responses but
have denied any wrongdoing.
   Cranston said he attended the April 2 meeting with Gray because
Keating had told him Lincoln was being treated unfairly by the bank
board in a yearlong examination.
   Bolstering Keating's complaint, Cranston said, were statements
by Lincoln's auditor and Alan Greenspan, now chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board but then a private consultant retained by
Keating, that the thrift and its investments were sound.

   Edson D. de Castro, co-founder in 1968 of
the Data General Corp., has been named chairman of the computer
maker and will relinquish his roles as president and chief
executive officer.
   Castro, 51, was elevated as the firm's first chairman Wednesday.
   ``I have no plans to retire soon,'' de Castro said.
   He said that as chairman, he will focus on long-term strategy,
which he said had been neglected as Data General stuggled with
slumping minicomputer sales and larger rivals such as Digital
Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.
   Succeeding de Castro is Ronald L. Skates, 48, Data General's
executive vice president and chief operating officer. Skates is a
former partner at Price Waterhouse, Data General's auditor.
   Herbert J. Richman, another Data General co-founder, was named
vice chairman. Richman, 54, will continue to direct the company's
sales organization.
