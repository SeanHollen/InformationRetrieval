<TEXT>
   A general strike called to protest
the nullified election fizzled Wednesday as fear kept most people
from antagonizing the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega, in his first interview since an election May 7 that was
later annuled, criticized President Bush's call for his overthrow.
``The Panamanian conscience cannot accept appeals from men who
direct this imperialism,'' he told France's Antenne 2 network.
   In Washington, the foreign ministers of the Organization of
American States approved a resolution that held Noriega responsible
for the ``grave events and abuses'' in Panama, including election
fraud, voiding the election results and beating opposition
candidates.
   The foreign ministers also said they would send mediators to
Panama in an effort to end that country's political crisis through
a ``transfer of power.''
   The strike, called by the opposition to protest the annulment of
the elections, was timed to coincide with the emergency OAS meeting.
   Some workers and customers stayed home, but many merchants said
they kept their stores open because of possible retaliation.
   ``We were closed for two months last year and we got nothing out
of it. The crisis got worse,'' said a furniture store owner in the
capital.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara quickly
declared the strike a ``total success,'' but it was far less
effective than a similar action last year.
   ``Frankly, I'm not satisfied with the reaction of the people,''
said vice presidential candidate Guillermo Ford at an afternoon
press conference. ``I thought people would express their
dissatisfaction in a harsher way.''
   The opposition asked the OAS to recognize its election victory
and condemn Noriega for the May 10 attacks by Noriega supporters
that injured Endara and vice presidential candidates Ford and
Ricardo Arias Calderon.
   Noriega, in the French television interview, denied his forces
beat opposition figures.
   ``The police gave their protection to the candidates. I have as
proof that those who were injured were members of the police
forces,'' he said, showing photographs of what apparently were
hospitalized policemen.
   The failed strike once again raised questions about whether the
opposition's willingness to fight and to unify is as strong as
Noriega's determination to remain in power.
   ``Noriega is willing to die here, he'll have to be carried out
of the barracks feet first,'' said one opposition supporter.
   Like most people interviewed, he feared to allow his name to be
used. Noriega possesses the real power in Panama because he
commands the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   The pro-Noriega Labor Party on Wednesday afternoon proposed
negotiations between the opposition, the government parties and the
Defense Forces.
   Arias Calderon said the government does not have a civilian
sector and any negotiations must be with the military.
   The opposition called for people to demonstrate at noon in their
own neighborhoods in the capital, where one-third of the nation's
2.5 million people live. Most neighborhoods were silent, however.
   Most stores and many banks were open, although some reported far
fewer customers than usual. Shoestore owner Angel Aguilar reported
he usually sells 15 pairs by noon, but on Wednesday sold only one.
   In the port city of Colon, 50 miles north of Panama City, stores
in a free trade zone were told they would lose their licenses if
they closed, according to one shopowner.
   The government said the strike was illegal because it was called
for political, not economic reasons.
   The government also set Wednesday rather than Monday as a payday
for government workers.
   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since two
federal grand juries in Florida indicted him on drug charges last
year, but Noriega has withstood economic sanctions and internal
protests so far.
   Noriega denies the drug charges and says they are part of a plot
by the United States to abrogate treaties that turn the Panama
Canal over to Panama.

<HEAD>Talks on Namibian Independence Adjourned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RUACANA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuban, Angolan and South African
delegates discussing the timetable for independence for Namibia
adjourned their talks early Tuesday but will meet again, a South
African general told reporters.
   Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys gave no details but said, ``We have not
terminated our discussions'' and the delegates would consult their
governments before meeting again.
   Then he said the talks would resume Friday at a location in
Angola to be announced.
   Geldenhuys was asked about reports that South Africa wanted to
know if the delegations could be certain that all guerrillas
fighting South African administration of the territory have
withdrawn.
   ``That is still under discussion and will be pursued Friday,''
he said.
   South Africa has said the independence process could be
endangered if significant numbers of guerrillas of the South-West
Africal People's Organization remain in Namibia and do not return
to their bases in Angola.
   Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, has been administered
by South Africa since World War I.
   South Africa agreed in December to end its control of the
territory under a regional peace plan that also requires Cuba to
withdraw its estimated 50,000 soldiers from Angola. The Cubans have
helped Angola's Marxist government fight the U.S.-supported rebels.
   Representatives of the three nations along with U.S. and Soviet
observers met Monday and early Tuesday at a site about 600 yards
north of the Namibian border and near the Angolan town of Ruacana.
   The talks are seen as crucial to the U.N.-sponsored plan to make
Namibia independent next year.
   The year-long transition was derailed April 1, the day it began,
when an estimated 1,600 SWAPO guerrillas entered Namibia despite an
agreement that they remain at their bases in Angola at least until
mid-May.
   South African officials said 316 guerrillas and 27 members of
the Namibian security forces were killed in fighting before SWAPO
ordered its men to return to Angola.
   The joint commission is also expected to discuss a new date for
SWAPO rebels to be allowed to enter Namibia peacefully. Some
officials have said the return, originally set for May 15, could
start May 22.
   Namibian elections are scheduled to be held in November before
the annual rainy season that disrupts travel. Some observers say
that a significant postponement of the timetable could prevent
elections before next February after the rains have stopped.

   A nine-year-old East German boy
was killed and several of his six companions injured when they
tried to flee to West Germany through a Czechoslovak border post,
the state-run CTK news agency said.
   The agency said the incident occurred early Tuesday when a
Soviet-made Volga sedan tried to ram a barrier at the
Czechoslovak-West German border at Strazny, about 100 miles
southwest of Prague.
   Seven East Germans, four of them children, were traveling in the
car, CTK said. The unidentified driver tried to smash through the
border barrier but crashed, slicing the roof off the car, it added.
   A nine-year-old boy was killed and an unspecified number of
other people injured, it said, adding that all the survivors were
detained by Czechoslovak border guards.
   The East Germans were not identified and CTK did not report
their hometown or any other details abot their background, saying
only that the case was under investigation.

<HEAD>Army Officials Still Assessing Storm Damage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KILLEEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weekend storm that damaged more than
half of the 190 Apache tank-killer helicopters at the Army's huge
base here could wind up costing hundreds of millions of dollars,
lawmakers said Tuesday.
   Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House Defense
Appropriations Committee, said the damage could be as much as half
a billion dollars after touring the base on Monday.
   Army officials here at Fort Hood, the largest armed installation
in the free world, said their first inspections could not determine
how many of the $13.4 million helicopters were affected by
Saturday's powerful storm.
   The Apache, one of the Army's most modern helicopters, is
designed to take on tanks. It can carry 16 laser-homing Hellfire
missiles or 76 rockets and has a 30mm machine gun that can fire
various kinds of ammunition.
   The storm, packing howling thunderstorms and 95 mph winds, also
damaged two public schools, family housing, barracks and other
equipment.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told Phoenix radio station KFYI there
were indications that more than 100 AH-64 Apache helicopters out of
the 190 on the base were damaged.
   ``Of those, about 35 will require extensive maintenance,'' he
said from his Washington office. He said it would be some months
before those helicopters would be ready to return to service, ``if
at all.''
   Fort Hood is home to the Apache Training Brigade. The damage
forced the base to downgrade its state of aviation readiness, said
Army Chief of Staff Gen. Carl E. Vuono.
   ``We have flown in a number of teams to make a detailed
technical assessment,'' Vuono said. ``They will decide which
aircraft can be repaired on site and which will have to be taken to
a depot for repairs.''
   The storms knocked over many of the helicopters and bent or
broke rotor blades, said base spokeswoman Liz Crossan. She could
not say whether any of the aircraft were destroyed or how much of
the fleet was damaged.
   Ms. Crossan said it was impossible to say how many helicopters
were damaged until inspection teams examine each one, because some
damage might not be immediately visible. It was not known how long
the inspections would take, she said.
   Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, who also toured the base, put the
damage at several hundred million dollars. ``The good news is that
no one was killed,'' he said.
   Stu Dodge, a vice president of Apache programs at McDonnell
Douglas Helicopter Co. in Mesa, Ariz., said his company was
awaiting an Army damage report before taking any action.
   McDonnell Douglas has delivered about 460 Apaches on a contract
which called for 975. President Bush said last month in unveiling
his defense cuts that the Army now wants only 807, 168 fewer.
   The cutback would trim Apache production from the current 10 a
month to six a month beginning in June 1990.
   McDonnell Douglas announced May 2 that it would lay off this
month 450 temporary and regular employees, 355 at Mesa and 95 at
its plant in Culver City, Calif, and the same number next year
because of the cutback.

   An incumbent mayor who likes to be called a
``Jewish grandmother'' beat back four challengers Tuesday in the
Democratic primary, giving her an almost sure ticket to victory in
November.
   ``Thank you to all of Pittsburgh,'' Mayor Sophie Masloff said.
``I accept this victory with deep appreciation and humility.''
   Mrs. Masloff, 71, known as ``Sophie'' around the city, was City
Council president last year when she was appointed to fill the
vacancy left by the death of Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri.
   With 394 of 402 precincts reporting, Mrs. Masloff had 29,994
votes, or 28 percent, to 24,766, or 23 percent for state Rep.
Thomas J. Murphy Jr.
   The man who had been considered her main challenger, Allegheny
County controller Frank Lucchino, trailed with 22,616 votes, or 21
percent.
   Byrd R. Brown, an attorney who led the local NAACP branch during
the 1960s, and City Controller Tom Flaherty, who had the local
party endorsement, split the remainder.
   ``We're a family and we just had a good talk about the future,''
Mrs. Masloff said of the campaign and her opponents. ``We all
learned a lot. ... These are good and serious people and I salute
them.''
   Mrs. Masloff's challengers conceded defeat well before midnight
Tuesday. None said he planned to run as a Republican or independent
against Mrs. Masloff in November.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Caliguiri, who died of the rare heart disease amyloidosis in May
1988, was mayor for 11 years, twice winning re-election by
landslides.
   The Democratic winner is all but certain to win the November
election. Democrats represent 82 percent of the city's 220,069
voters. The Republicans have not elected a mayor since 1933 and no
GOP candidates were in the primary.
   Mrs. Masloff, who uses the ``Jewish grandmother'' tag as part of
her folksy image, has been a Democratic loyalist for more than 50
years.
   Lucchino, 50, a lawyer and a longstanding party leader who is
serving a third term as county controller, was Mrs. Masloff's main
rival in the polls, although surveys showed his support waning in
the last month.
   He had the support of the city's two daily newspapers and
reportedly spent more than $1.2 million on his campaign, more than
twice that spent by Mrs. Masloff.
   Issues included the contenders' political personalities,
economic development and jobs, the city's 3.5 percent wage tax on
residents, a 10 percent amusement tax, crime prevention,
neighborhood renewal and gay rights.
   Pittsburghers also voted for Democrats seeking nine nominations
to City Council under a new district set-up replacing the current
at-large system.
   Black leaders hope the new districts will deliver two blacks to
the Council.

   The United States stepped up efforts Tuesday
to safeguard relatives of U.S. military personnel in Panama,
offering immediate evacuations for any of the 14,000 military
dependents who may want to leave that troubled country.
   The Defense Department described the escalated effort as a
cautionary move in light of recent election-related violence and
sought to avoid creating the impression that there was any need for
panic.
   But Pentagon officials said that while the program is voluntary,
some relatives ultimately might be ordered home despite their
wishes.
   The first group of 276 American evacuees, including State
Department and military families, arrived 10:45 p.m. Tuesday in
Charleston, S.C., on a chartered commercial airliner. Others will
be transported on the military cargo planes that have been ferrying
extra troops to Panama.
   The first group of tired-looking passengers, several of them
carrying infants and small children, entered the terminal in
Charleston about 10 minutes later to begin clearance through
customs.
   There are about 14,000 military dependents in Panama, most of
them already on U.S. military bases. The primary objects o the
evacuation effort are the roughly 3,100 Americans who have been
living in Panamanian neighborhoods outside U.S. military bases, but
any of the dependents may leave if they wish.
   ``We are working a plan to insure the safety of the military
dependents to the greatest degree that we possibly can,'' said Dan
Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman.
   ``The situation (in Panama) has deteriorated further. We have
seen the violence on the streets of Panama. We are offering a way
for ... dependents to return to the U.S. if they so desire. We
think this is a prudent move.''
   Last week, when President Bush ordered extra troops to Panama,
defense officials ordered 1,400 off-base dependents to move inside
the military bases on a temporary basis.
   While some of those families can find vacant on-base houses,
most are going to have to come home, Howard said.
   ``The long-term goal is that they will be in permanent quarters
on the installations or returned to the continental United States
by July 1,'' Howard said.
   ``We will certainly exercise the voluntary element to the
maximum extent that it is feasible. But I hope you understand that
we simply don't have housing accommodations for all these people on
our military installations in Panama,'' he said.
   Howard refused to characterize Tuesday's effort as an
evacuation, suggesting it was a continuation of the Defense
Department's practice during the past year of reducing the number
of military families living off base.
   ``An evacuation, at least in my mind, creates images of people
grabbing up whatever they can in the household, rushing out the
front door and getting on an aircraft to get out of the country,''
he added. ``This is not an evacuation.''
   Military sources who asked not to be named said they expected at
least one and possibly two flights would be staged each day for
military families wishing to leave Panama.
   Howard declined to give details, saying they were still being
formulated.
   But he said 110 dependents of either State Department or
Pentagon employees had returned to the United States in the last
few days on a ``space available'' basis on military transports.
   The Pentagon divides the dependents of military personnel into
two categories _ command sponsored and non-command-sponsored. In
the case of the former, the serviceman has received official
permission to bring his family with him and normally serves a
longer tour of duty.
   In the latter case, the serviceman is serving a shorter,
unaccompanied tour but decides to bring his family anyway at his or
her own expense.
   The roughly 1,400 dependents who were ordered on to military
bases last week were the command-sponsored dependents, who must
honor such directives. Howard noted that as of last week, there
were another 1,685 dependents living off base who were not
sponsored and thus could only be urged to move on base.
   While those dependents cannot be issued orders, Howard said
they, too, were being encouraged to take advantage of the military
evacuation flights.
   Howard said the administration stepped up its efforts because of
the difficulty of forecasting the actions of the government of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, who staged and then nullified a popular
presidential election a week ago when it became clear his candidate
had lost.
   Some of the opposition candidates were then attacked during
rallies, prompting President Bush to order almost 2,000 additional
troops to Panama to ensure the safety of American citizens. There
are already some 10,000 troops in Panama.
   As of Tuesday, Howard said, 1,269 soldiers or Marines had
arrived in Panama out of the 1,881 Bush ordered south.

   The first U.S. military dependents and
personnel evacuated from Panama arrived Tuesday night aboard a
chartered commercial jet, and one said the situation there was
``bad and getting worse.''
   The blue-and-white L-1011 with 276 Defense Department personnel
and family members landed at Charleston International Airport
around 10:45 p.m.
   The first group of tired-looking passengers, several carrying
infants and small children, entered the terminal about 10 minutes
later to begin clearance through customs.
   ``The situation in Panama is bad and getting worse,'' said Army
Sgt. Raymond Johnson of El Paso, Texas. Johnson was bringing by his
wife, daughter and son back to stay with his family in El Paso.
   ``Being a family man, I felt it would be safer to have my family
here,'' he said. Johnson said members of the Panamanian Defense
Force often harass American personnel, stopping them on the streets
and sometimes asking for money.
   ``I just decided to go home and get out and let it settle
down,'' said Debbie Strong of Washington state, who was carrying an
infant. She said her husband is in the Army and she works on a base
in Panama.
   A second flight is scheduled to arrive late Wednesday, said Air
Force Lt. Lester T. Carroll Jr., a spokesman for the 437th Military
Airlift Wing.
   ``We're calling this a hastened withdrawal,'' said Army Lt. Col.
Bob Skinner, a Defense Department spokesman from Fort McPherson,
Ga., who was at the airport.
   ``An evacuation is mandatory,'' Skinner said. ``This is not an
emergency. It is voluntary.'' Carroll called the move
``precautionary.''
   The Defense Department earlier Tuesday offered immediate
evacuations to any of the 14,000 military dependents in Panama.
   Carroll said he did not know how much notice the military
dependents were given before leaving Panama.
   He said some passed through Charleston on Monday on a regularly
scheduled military charter.
   The flights to Charleston are regularly scheduled military
charter flights, Skinner said.
   He said he did not know of any additional flights beyond the one
scheduled for Wednesday night.
   However, military sources who asked not to be identified said
they expected at least one and possibly two flights would be staged
each day for military families wishing to leave Panama.
   Those who arrived Tuesday were to spend the night at Charleston
Air Force Base, hotels or friends in the area, Skinner said.
   Some were expected to take connecting flights out of Charleston
as early as 6 a.m. Wednesday.

   MEROM GOLAN, Israeli-Annexed Golan Heights (AP) _ In a copse of
trees overlooking the gentle rolling plain dividing the armies of
Israel and Syria, a memorial has been fashioned from the rubble of
war: artillery shells, hunks of rusting guns, food tins, a helmet.
   ``Oh brothers, the heroes of Golan with your unshaven faces, we
salute you who stood against the enemy tanks, you who proved that
the armor and man are both made of steel,'' reads a poem to 25
Israeli soldiers from Battalion 71, Brigade 188. They died in some
of the fiercest tank battles of the 1973 war.
   Scores of makeshift war memorials along the roads and in the
abandoned, bullet-pocked Syrian towns and military installations
give a ghostlike atmosphere to the 700-square-mile expanse of the
Golan Heights.
   Israeli experts predict that if there is a new Arab-Israeli war
it will be fought on the Golan Heights, a vast slab of basalt
scored by deep rocky ravines. The Israeli and Syrian forces are
separated by a thin blue line of 1,400 U.N. peacekeepers.
   Israel seized the 45-by-16 mile plateau from Syria in the 1967
Middle East war and annexed it in 1981. Since 1967, about 7,000
Israelis have joined the 12,000 Druse Arabs already living in the
Golan Heights.
   In two wars and countless skirmishes, 4,900 Syrians and 960
Israelis have been killed.
   The Golan Heights is littered with shattered armor and mine
fields marked off by yellow signs with red triangles. There also
are freshly dug anti-tank ditches in the grassy fields, and modern
army camps and hilltop lookouts bristle with radar and early
warning antennae.
   ``In the past year, there has been a tremendous amount of
activity (by Israel) in putting up obstacles in the Golan Heights.
I have no doubt (this) will have an important impact on Syrian
decision-making concerning the possibility of a surprise attack,''
Brig. Gen. Yosef Eyal said in an interview with the weekly army
magazine Bamahane.
   Senior Israeli commanders and independent military analysts see
Syria as posing the only palpable threat from the Arab camp,
although their view is that the chances of war with Syria are
minimal at present.
   ``The only concrete enemy at this point is Syria. The appearance
of a wider coalition is not realistic at this stage,'' Maj. Gen.
Ehud Barak, deputy chief of staff, said in a recent interview on
Israel radio.
   ``In our estimate, there is not a strong chance of a total war
with Syria in the next year,'' Barak said.
   However, Israeli officials repeatedly point to Syria's
increasing military potential and its stated policy of achieving
``strategic parity,'' or military equality, with Israel.
   They note that Syria now has chemical weapons,
surface-to-surface missiles that can reach Tel Aviv and
sophisticated artillery with firing computers. Its attempts to
purchase the Soviet Su-24 long-range bomber and develop an
arms-making industry also are viewed with concern.
   Israel has responded by introducing a new tank, the Merkava Mark
3, which was developed to handle the tough Golan terrain. An army
film shows the tank plowing through a stone wall and leaping 30
feet from an embankment at full speed like a motorcycle.
   Said an Israeli an army officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity:
   ``If the next war occurs, the feeling in the Israeli Defense
Forces is that it will be on the Golan Heights. The main outlays in
terms of money and training go to the Golan and not to the
intefadeh,'' or Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Aharon Levran, a retired Israeli brigadier general, said Syria
is capable of deploying about two-thirds of its military force in
the Golan Heights on short notice. This would amount to about six
of its 10 divisions along with about 2,000 tanks and 1,500
artillery pieces.
   New missiles, improved artillery and long-range bombers could
bring the war into civilian areas for the first time if a conflict
broke out.
   ``Israel has been spoiled by not feeling such strikes in
previous wars. Now, there has been a strategic change and the
Syrians can now hit Israel in depth,'' said Levran.
   But he said the time was not ripe for Syria to begin a war
because it lacks an Arab partner and would not have backing from
the Soviet Union, its major arms supplier.
   ``All wars in the Middle East have involved Arab coalitions.
This rule still applies, I believe, '' he said.

imposed by the Senate on President Bush's plan to coproduce the FSX
jet fighter with Japan may force the renegotiation of parts of the
agreement.
   The Senate on Tuesday voted 52-47 to defeat a bid by Sen. Alan
Dixon, D-Ill., to scrap the FSX deal.
   But it then adopted, 72-27, an amendment by Sen. Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., to tighten the conditions under which codevelopment and
coproduction of the new fighter would take place.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger made it known
immediately before the vote that the administration regards the new
directives as unneccessary and likely to trigger new and lengthy
negotiations.
   The votes came after two days of debate in which senators
emotionally and angrily denounced Japan for allegedly unfair trade
competition and sounded warnings that the deal could threaten U.S.
dominance of the aerospace industry by transferring vital
technology to Japanese industry.
   ``It would be foolhardy not to be vigilant in protecting our
aircraft industry and the vital technologies associated with it,''
Byrd said. ``This nation needs to get our economic relationship
with Japan on a saner and sounder track.''
   The amendment was opposed by the administration and Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas dubbed it a ``killer
amendment'' which would require the reopening of negotiations with
the Japanese government.
   Byrd said the amendment ``will not torpedo'' the deal but will
provide necessary protection for the United States.
   Roman Popadiuk, a Bush administration spokesman, noted the White
House had made the Senate aware of its objections to the Byrd
amendment in advance of the vote and said there would be no further
comment until its language was carefully considered.
   Eagleburger, in a letter circulated before the Senate action,
said additional restrictions imposed by Congress would ``inhibit
rather than facilitate'' the FSX program.
   He said the terms of the arrangements with Japan are already
consistent with the content of the amendment and do protect U.S.
``security, economic and technological strengths and interests.''
   ``Implementation of additional conditions ... which would
require renegotiation in some cases, would not materially advance
these objectives,'' Eagleburger said.
   The amendment prohibits the transfer of advanced jet engine
technology to the Japanese, in Byrd's words, ``under any
circumstances.''
   It would bar the Japanese from selling or transferring FSX
aircraft technology to third parties.
   ``No one expects the Japanese to turn this system into an export
item, and this provision simply makes it impermissible for the
Japanese to use the specific systems they are getting from us to
enter the international market,'' Byrd said.
   The amendment also expresses the sense of Congress that the
United States receive no less than 40 percent of the production
work on the aircraft.
   Byrd complained that the present arrangement calls for
``approximately'' 40 percent and said that was too vague and too
liable to result in future squabbles.
   During debate on resolution of disapproval, senators repeatedly
accused Japan of taking unfair economic advantage of the defense
umbrella the United States has provided since the end of World War
II.
   ``The United States is the very best friend they have ever had
in their entire history,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``We
provided a safe haven and a safe world that allowed them to
flourish beyond anything they ever could have done.''
   ``But I don't believe it is the action of an ally, a friend, a
partner,'' Domenici said, for the Japanese to refuse to buy the
existing American F-16 fighter ``off the shelf'' and to insist
instead ``on a half-baked deal'' to coproduce an entirely new
fighter using American technology.
   Dixon called the arrangement ``a sucker deal'' and ``a
tragically bad deal for America.
   ``We have a $54 billion trade deficit with the Japanese, and for
the one area _ aerospace _ in which we have a $19 billion trade
surplus, we want to give it to them on a golden platter.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told his colleagues: ``It will cost
Japan nearly three times as much per plane to coproduce the FSX as
it would to buy the F-16. Clearly, Japan wants whatever technology
it can acquire, so they can build not just an FSX _ but an aircraft
industry.''
   But Dole and Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who led the fight to
reject the disapproval resolution, said the plan is in the
interests of the United States for what they said are sound
military and economic reasons.
   They said the present plan, originally negotiated by former
President Reagan and modified by Bush, gives Japan the advanced
aircraft it will need to fufill defense roles in the late 1990s and
also will provide a $2.5 billion benfit to the United States in
contracts and jobs.

   There was weeping on ``Family Ties'' as the
series closed out a seven-year run on NBC Sunday, but the network
wasn't crying this week when it broke CBS' quarter-century-old
record winning ratings streak.
   CBS won 46 weeks in a row in the 1962-63 season. As of Sunday,
NBC had been in first place for 47 straight weeks in the A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings and added to the honor by taking the top 11
spots in the rankings, the first time a network has done that in 10
years.
   NBC prepared a list of nostalgic trivia to illustrate how long a
26-year-old record is. In 1962-63, ``The Tonight Show Starring
Johnny Carson'' premiered, the New York Mets lost 120 games in
their first season, Marilyn Monroe died, and there was no such
thing as VCRs, personal computers, the Super Bowl, remote control,
Tylenol or People magazine.
   ``This record-breaking performance _ assuming nobody has made
another clerical mistake _ really belongs to the talented, writers,
producers, directors and actors whose consistently fine work has
won the hearts and viewing habits of the American public,'' said
NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff.
   His statement referred to NBC's premature declaration a few
weeks ago that it had set a record, until CBS pointed out that the
record actually ran to 46 weeks.
   The special one-hour finale of ``Family Ties'' was last week's
No. 1 show, with a 20.8 rating and 35 share. It was broadcast
opposite the final episode of ABC's ``Moonlighting,'' which had
lost viewers so dramatically, it had dwindled to third from the
bottom in the rankings.
   NBC, which has won four seasons in a row, won last week with an
average, prime-time rating of 15.7. ABC, whose massive miniseries
``War and Remembrance'' took up much of the week with mediocre
ratings, had an 11.8. CBS had an 11.3.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 households with television. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The rest of the top 10 were all NBC's: ``Golden Girls,'' ``The
Cosby Show,'' ``Top Gun,'' ``Jackee Special,'' ``Cheers,'' ``In the
Heat of the Night,'' ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' ``L.A. Law'' and
``Hunter.'' NBC's Sunday movie, ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off,''
ranked 11th. NBC said the last time a network had the top 11 shows
was 1979, when ABC had the miniseries ``Roots II.''
   The five-part conclusion of ABC's ``War and Remembrance'' built
audience each night, but after Sunday night's conclusion, which
ranked 18th, it wound up with an average rating of 14.8 and a 23.
   The first 17{ hours of the ``Winds of War'' sequel ran in
November and had an average rating of 18.6 and a 29 share.
   The 10 lowest-rated shows last week were: ``Jesse Hawkes,''
``Murder by Moonlight,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Hard Time on Planet
Earth,'' ``North and South, Book Two, Part One,'' ``Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar,'' ``Incredible Sunday,'' ``Moonlighting,'' ``A Man
Called Hawk'' and ``The Jim Henson Hour.''
   In the news ratings, ``ABC World News Tonight'' won the week
with an average rating of 10.2 and a 21 share. The ``CBS Evening
News'' had a 9.4 and 19. ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.0 and 19
share.

   A helicopter used in filming a Chuck
Norris action movie crashed into a ravine and exploded Tuesday,
killing four people, two of them Americans, officials said.
   The other four people aboard, including two Americans, were
seriously injured, authorities said.
   The scene for ``Stranglehold: Delta Force II'' called for the
French-made Dauphin helicopter to catch fire and it took several
moments before the stunned crew on the ground realized the crash
was real, said police investigator Jaime Talay.
   The crash occurred near a mansion once owned by former President
Ferdinand Marcos in Tagaytay, a mountain resort 30 miles south of
Manila.
   Norris was not on the set when the crash occurred but he was in
the Philippines, said Randy Maiers, spokesman for Cannon
Entertainment of Beverly Hills, Calif., maker of the movie. Maiers
spoke in Los Angeles.
   Police and members of the film crew said the single-rotor,
14-passenger helicopter had just taken off to film a scene when it
veered to the left and plunged into a 40-foot ravine.
   A fire truck stationed nearby helped extinguish the blaze, Talay
said.
   Authorities and the movie company identified the three film crew
members killed as Americans Don Marshall, the gaffer, or chief
electrician, and Mike Graham, the key grip, or head of the set
handymen, and cameraman Gadi Danzig, an Israeli citizen. No home
towns were available.
   The Filipino pilot, Jojo Imperial, died a few hours later in a
hospital, officials said.
   Among the injured, with a dislocated shoulder, was John P. Ryan,
a white-haired character actor in his 50s who plays the Delta Force
commander in the current movie, reported Todd Eisner, assistant to
Ryan's manager, in Los Angeles. Ryan played a warden in ``Runaway
Train.''
   In a statement released in the Philippines, Cannon Entertainment
said eight people were aboard the helicopter. No one on the ground
was hurt, the statement said.
   Cannon said the scene was not considered hazardous or risky.
   Besides Ryan, Cannon said other injured included Geoff Brewer,
an actor-stuntman, about 30, of Los Angeles; Rami Siman-Tov, an
Israeli crew member, and actor Mateo Gomez. Police said Gomez was
an American, but U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel said he was
not.
   The statement said surgery was performed late Tuesday and
victims were recovering. Spokesmen at the U.S.-run Clark Air Base,
50 miles north of Manila, said the injured were transferred there
Wednesday to determine theri conditions.
   The Dauphin, also known as the Dolphin, is made for both
military and civilian use by Aerospatiale, the French
government-controlled aircraft company.
   Officials said the aircraft was owned by Traders Royal Bank, a
Filipino bank.
   The crew of ``Stranglehold: Delta Force II'' had been in the
Philippines for two months and were due to finish filming on May
27. The movie depicts the destruction of a Latin American drug
syndicate.
   It was the second accident involving a Norris film in the
Philippines.
   In 1987, a Philippine military Sikorsky helicopter used by
Norris' crew crashed in Manila Bay, killing three Filipino soldiers
working as extras.
   The 1987 crash took place while Norris was filming ``Missing In
Action, Part III _ Braddock.''

<HEAD>Some States Have Too Much Rain, Some Too Little</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain, like wealth, is plentiful is some areas
while other parts of the United States are living hand-to-mouth, so
to speak.
   In Ohio, part of the eastern Corn Belt that has been drenched
lately, farmers had planted only 13 percent of their corn acreage
by May 14, compared with 87 percent a year ago and the normal
mid-May progress of 72 percent.
   A report by the Agriculture Department on Tuesday following a
meeting of the department's 1989 drought task force said rain
continues to delay spring planting in some areas while others,
notably the central and southern Great Plains, still need moisture.
   ``Planting is delayed by wet, cool weather in eastern Corn Belt,
Delta and East Coast (areas), but is progressing rapidly in western
Great Lakes, western Corn Belt and spring wheat areas,'' the report
said.
   ``Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Michigan have
planted 30 percent to 43 percent of their corn crop. North Dakota,
Montana and Minnesota have planted about one-third of their spring
wheat,'' it added.
   The report was issued following a meeting of the department's
1989 drought task force, which is headed by Undersecretary Richard
Crowder.
   ``Winter wheat conditions improved in the Pacific Northwest and
northern Great Plains but deteriorated in the central and southern
Great Plains,'' the report said. ``The crop moisture index
indicates excellent moisture for germination of recently planted
crops in the Great Plains, Great Lakes and central Corn Belt.''
   The task force noted that the National Weather Service calls for
beneficial rains in the Great Plains and central Corn Belt in the
next five to 10 days, with favorably drier weather in the eastern
Corn Belt.
   ``The outlook through mid-June calls for cool, wet weather in
the South and East, and warm, dry weather from the eastern Dakotas
into the central Corn Belt,'' the report said.
   Looking at the livestock situation, the report said pasture
conditions nationally are rated ``poor to fair'' but that the
situation in much of the northern plains is ``very poor to severe.''
   ``Cattle slaughter is down 4 percent from a year ago, but last
week's slaughter figures were the same as at this time last year,''
the report said. ``Beef cow slaughter was up arouind 60 percent
(in) both the central and northern plains, however. Cow prices in
recent weeks have returned to 1987 levels, reflecting the effects
of increased slaughter.''
   The task force said that as of May 15, haying and grazing of
land normally idled during the growing season under acreage
conservation provisions were open for haying and grazing in 323
counties of eight states: California, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri,
Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota and Texas.
   Emergency feed assistance, along with haying and grazing of
other designated conservation land also has been made available in
designated counties of the drought areas. In all, some form of
special drought aid is available in hundreds of counties in more
than two dozen states.

   The Agriculture Department says a virus called
Abby shows promise of being an effective killer of foliage-eating
gypsy moths.
   Entomologist Martin Shapiro of the department's Agricultural
Research Service said Tuesday that once the virus is applied, it is
transmitted to each new generation of moths.
   The agency and the Forest Service plan to field test the Abby
virus this summer in western Maryland. Scientists will count the
number of dead moth larvae and measure the amount of foliage that
was protected.
   Shapiro said that if Abby passes the tests, the virus could
become an alternative to either Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria or
diflubenzuron, a chemical, presently used against the moths by
keeping them from reaching adulthood.
   Shapiro, who has worked on the virus strain for about seven
years at the agency's insect pathology laboratory in Beltsville,
Md., named the new virus Abby after the town where it was found,
Abington, Mass.
   The Abby virus showed up early in the studies as one of the most
effective of 19 different strains of nuclear polyhdrosis virus, or
NPV, around the world. The NPV strains infect gypsy caterpillars
but may not always prevent them from defoliating trees.
   But Shapiro said the Abby virus showed in laboratory tests that
it can kill more caterpillars 10 times faster than the standard
NPV, which has been used for two years by the National Park Service
in selected areas of Rock Creek Park in Washington D.C.
   Park officials said that wherever NPV was sprayed, there was
``little or no defoliation'' to the trees. Shapiro said: ``And that
was the natural strain, not Abby.''
   Gypsy moths in the caterpillar or larvae stage are voracious
eaters of foliage and have gradually spread from Massachusetts,
where they were imported in 1969 by a French biologist to breed
with native American silkworms.
   But the moths escaped from the laboratory and started eating
foliage. The scientist, Louis Trouvellot, returned to France and
pursued a career in astronomy.

<HEAD>Harvard Law School Professor Taking Over as Dean</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert C. Clark once planned to be a
priest. Now the professor who wrote the book on corporate law is
accepting a task some regard as sacred: shepherding Harvard Law
School.
   The 44-year-old Clark takes over July 1 as the school's new
dean, succeeding 61-year-old James Vorenberg, who wanted to return
to teaching.
   A political conservative, Clark will be in various ways
responsible for and to 1,700 students, 65 faculty members, 365
employees and 25,000 alumni. He has been a professor at the school
since 1978.
   ``We have a responsiblity to give the best education and instill
some important values,'' he said in a recent interview. ``The most
important thing is the simplest things: Lawyers should be
scrupulously honest.
   ``That's not a foregone conclusion. People are tempted in many
ways throughout their careers. It's very important for all of our
graduates to feel they owe something to society, that they're
privileged and they ought to pay back.''
   Clark also wants to increase the faculty by 10, adding a couple
of new teachers a year, hold a major fund-raising drive and boost
morale.
   ``I'm not just interested in things being OK,'' he said. ``I
want people to think they're part of the greatest law school
around, so that they do their best.''
   Clark has degrees from Maryknoll Seminary, Columbia University
and Harvard Law School. His book, ``Corporate Law,'' is regarded as
a leading textbook on the subject.
   Much has been made of Clark's outspoken dislike for Critical
Legal Studies, a movement of lawyers at Harvard and elsewhere who
contend that the American legal system is not as neutral as it is
purported to be. They say it entrenches the power of a largely
white, male, upper-middle class.
   Clark has blamed conflicts over Critical Legal Studies-leaning
faculty for lowering the quality of the teaching staff. When he was
named dean in February, The Wall Street Journal cheered with an
editorial: ``Mr. Clark's appointment signals that Harvard wants the
law school's flirtation with radical politics to come to a
screeching halt.'' Today, Clark calls the issue ``old hat.''
   ``The divisions are greatly exaggerated. The relationships are
changing,'' he said.
   Faculty proponents of Critical Legal Studies said they didn't
want to comment on Clark's appointment. But international law
Professor David Kennedy, a self-described progressive, said faculty
reaction to Clark's appointment ranges ``from anxiety to
wait-and-see.''
   ``Since he was announced, he's taken, in general, a more
moderate position on issues of diversity than he did before,''
Kennedy said. ``He's been an ardent opponent of Critical Legal
Studies for more than a decade. But I don't expect him to do
anything evil to CLS. He's a very nice guy.''

   A talk show host has taken Martin Sheen up
on his declaration of this seaside celebrity enclave as a
nuclear-free zone and a sanctuary for the homeless and aliens.
   Sheen made the declaration last week after being named honorary
mayor of this community, which is home to the likes of Barbra
Streisand, Sylvester Stallone and Johnny Carson.
   Nationally syndicated New York-based talk show host Rush
Limbaugh called the declaration bizarre and said he's organizing a
drive to purchase one-way tickets to Malibu for ``indigents and
illegal aliens from across the United States.''
   Mary Lou Blackwood, executive vice president of the Chamber of
Commerce, said Tuesday she has handled hundreds of telephone calls
from angry residents and curious reporters.
   ``One has to see the consequences of what one does,'' she said.
``The community is pretty upset.''
   Sheen, on location in Canada, released a statement Tuesday that
said his honorary position doesn't give him any authority. But he
couldn't resist making another decree.
   ``I hereby declare Malibu a free-speech zone forever. That's all
for now. Faith, hope, love.''

   Actor Ted Danson says his personal life doesn't
live up to that of his ``Cheers'' character, bartending bachelor
Sam Malone.
   ``I'm a homebody,'' Danson, 41, said in June's Redbook magazine.
``I find that I operate much better in life being surrounded by my
family.''
   Danson, who starred in the recent film ``Cousins,'' lives in
Santa Monica, Calif., with his wife of 12 years, Casey, and their
daughters, Kate, 9, and Alexis, 4.
   The marriage ran into trouble after Casey had a stroke while
delivering Kate, he said. Three hard years of physical therapy
followed.
   ``During that time, there was a real moment of 50-50: `Do we
stay or do we go?''' Danson said. ``It may not have been
verbalized, but that's what our trouble was about _ whether or not
the commitment was still there.
   ``Having been married once before, I eventually realized that I
could probably be married to a goddess _ the perfect woman _ and
screw it up in two or three years. I knew Casey wasn't the problem
_ it was me.''

   John F. Kennedy Jr. said he wouldn't
complain if someone sought to build housing for the homeless in
Hyannisport, Mass., site of the Kennedy compound.
   ``You can start in my house,'' Kennedy said Tuesday in an
interview on WVOX-AM and WRTN-FM in this New York City suburb.
   The 28-year-old son of President Kennedy was asked during a
call-in show what would happen if housing for the homeless was
proposed in Hyannisport. He said such a plan would meet resistance
but would succeed eventually.
   Kennedy is a board member of HELP Inc., a non-profit
organization that builds transitional housing for homeless women
with children. Also appearing on the show was Andrew Cuomo, 31, the
head of HELP and son of Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Cuomo has met resistance from Westchester residents to his plans
to build HELP projects in the area.

   The former manager of ABBA, the
disbanded pop group, is creating a sort-of Nobel Prize for music
with the $6 million he got for selling his record company.
   ``It is a broad prize. Had it existed before, Elvis Presley and
the Beatles probably would have won it, Louis Armstrong and Duke
Ellington and Bach and Beethoven,'' Stikkan Andersson said Tuesday.
   The prize, worth several hundred thousand dollars, will be
awarded by the Swedish Royal Academy of Music beginning in 1991, he
said.
   Andersson had offered to finance a music prize to go with the
science and peace prizes awarded from the estate of 19th-century
inventor Alfred Nobel, but the Nobel Foundation rejected the idea.
   Andersson helped establish ABBA with Sweden Music, which still
draws a quarter of its royalties from music by the quartet that
broke up in 1981.

   Phyllis Diller says she was a
``trailblazer'' for female comics and can see her influence on the
hit television sitcom ``Roseanne.''
   ``That's my original premise,'' Ms. Diller said of the ABC
series starring Roseanne Barr. ``No one else has used it since me
but her. I was the first one to talk about the husband and the
three kids and the housework.
   ``She's a target for trouble trapped by her existence,'' she
said of Barr. ``She's not Grace Kelly, she has an ordinary husband
and a messy house.''
   Ms. Diller broke into comedy in 1955, when she was a 37-year-old
housewife trying to make enough money to unite her five children,
then living with relatives, under a roof of their own.
   She took the stage of a San Francisco night club with
established her trademark with a cigarette holder, spiky fright wig
and loud, gravelly laugh punctuating the jokes.
   ``Ten years later, Joan Rivers came along,'' said Ms. Diller,
who is appearing this weekend at the Showboat Hotel &amp; Casino. ``I
was the trailblazer.''

   Burt Reynolds says he loves it more than
any of his movies, but the actor plans to give his money-losing
dinner theater to a community college, a lawyer said.
   ``It's a wonderful educational opportunity,'' Palm Beach
attorney Robert Montgomery Jr. said Monday.
   Reynolds and a group of art promoters plan to raise $2 million
to renovate the 449-seat Jupiter theater and give it to the Palm
Beach Community College, said Montgomery, who has pledged $500,000.
   ``I love this theater more than any movie I've done,'' the actor
said in January. The theater cost him about $2.8 million and lost
about $1.5 million in 1987 and 1988, he said.
   Reynolds declined to comment on the theater Monday at a luncheon
in his home town of Jupiter, 80 miles north of Miami. He was
accepting an award for aiding Palm Beach County tourism.
   ``Let me enjoy my award,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report Says Advanced Strategic Missiles Threaten Powerful Nations</HEAD>
<UNK>With PM-World Conflict, Bjt</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weaker nations that have obtained technically
advanced ballistic missiles pose an increasing threat to their
powerful neighbors, the editors of ``Jane's Strategic Weapon
Systems'' warn.
   ``The past few years have seen the number of missile-capable
nations increase,'' editors Duncan Lennox and Roger Loasby wrote in
the first edition of the book, which was published Tuesday.
   ``This was not too important when the weapons concerned were
short-range and relatively inaccurate, but increasingly the trend
has been for longer range and more accurate missiles.''
   The book says that in the past 12 months, a Chinese missile
known as the CSS-2, with a range of about 930 miles, has been sold
to Middle East countries which also have Soviet technology.
   Reports also surfaced that those countries are negotiating to
acquire the more advanced ``M family'' of Chinese missiles, the
book says.
   ``In some instances, missile acquisitions are combined with a
probable capability to provide nuclear warheads and once this
happens, the whole thrust of denuclearization (within) the existing
nuclear powers is blunted,'' the editors said.
   They said short-range ballistic missiles are being developed or
are owned by at least 16 countries outside NATO and the Warsaw
Pact, including Argentina, Brazil, India, Egypt, North Korea, South
Yemen and Taiwan.
   They said it is not clear whether any of the missiles being
developed or sold outside the big five nuclear powers _ the United
States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China _ are being
armed with nuclear warheads.
   They noted, however, the last report by the International Atomic
Energy Agency suggested that a further eight countries have the
capability to manufacture nuclear warheads: Argentina, Colombia,
India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, South Africa and Vietnam.
   The book says there also is a further proliferation of
stationing ballistic and cruise missiles on ships and submarines.
   ``The dangers and vulnerabilities are obvious: previously safe
deployments of ships to trouble spots around the world could in the
future be threatened by such forces in the hands of smaller
nations,'' the editors wrote.
   ``With the improved accuracies and lethality of some
conventional warheads, all nations should be aware of the changing
threat.''
   Lennox and Loasby predict that space will be used in any future
confrontation not only between the superpowers but also smaller
nations.
   ``The scope for intelligence-gathering, monitoring of events,
navigation, meteorological data-gathering, global communications
and, perhaps, the eventual positioning of defensive and offensive
weapons in space, makes it essential for any nation planning to
defend itself to be involved in military space research,'' they
wrote.

<HEAD>Under Glasnost, Soviet Scholar Has More Data to Work With</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like other information in the Soviet Union,
the national census is being partially released under the new
policy of openness, and the early figures provide rich veins to be
mined by scholars like Murray Feshbach.
   ``We used to complain that we did not have enough information.
Now we complain that we have too much,'' said Feshbach, interviewed
amid the mountains of Soviet documents at his Georgetown University
office.
   But even under Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, ``there is a
lot missing,'' said Feshbach. ``And the quality of a lot of the
information is up for grabs.''
   Feshbach experienced one of the high points in his career in
late January when he was allowed to accompany a Moscow
census-taker. He proudly shows off a pin and card designating him
an official Soviet census-taker.
   ``With this, I could ride on the metro and bus for free, but for
five kopeks, I was a big spender,'' says Feshbach.
   Feshbach knows as much about Soviet statistics as virtually
anyone, in this country or the Soviet Union. The government calls
frequently on his expertise, and he was to testify on Capitol Hill
today on social change under Gorbachev.
   His experience as a Moscow census-taker taught him the Soviets
``are very likely to publish the figures in a more truthful
fashion'' than after the previous census in 1979. The results of
that census dribbled out, with major gaps.
   Allowing Feshbach to observe data collection was an indication
of rising Soviet candor, as was an incident at one Moscow apartment
he visited with a census-taker.
   ``Grandma could not read the card that asked her to point out
her source of income. There was a long embarrassing pause,'' said
Feshbach.
   ``But her daughter had a higher education,'' having completed a
five-year course in engineering and economics. ``That's a tribute
to what the Soviets have accomplished,'' said Feshbach.
   Preliminary census results are in, and have joined the stacks of
documents piled in Feshbach's office. The 1989 data contain bad
news for the Kremlin.
   The population of the Moslem republics of Central Asia, where
there is little industry and lots of underemployment, continued to
grow at a much faster pace than the Slavic republics, where workers
are needed. Russia grew by 7 percent, compared to 28 percent for
Turkmenistan, 22 percent for Kirghizia, 29 percent for Uzbekistan,
and 34 percent for Tadzhikistan.
   Feshbach, his appetite whetted, traces his finger along the
lines of numbers and Cyrillic characters to figure how many people
died in the Armenian earthquake last December.
   Pulling down Soviet statistical handbooks from his office
shelves, Feshbach calculates the population of Armenia had been
growing by about 50,000 per year, adds that to the 1988 figure,
subtracts the 1989 figure, and concludes there are ``approximately
250,000'' fewer people in Armenia than there would have been with
no earthquake.
   The official Soviet death toll: 25,000. Without more data, it is
impossible to explain the discrepancy.
   Similar methodology has produced headline-grabbing results over
the years.
   In 1980, Feshbach reported that infant mortality in the Soviet
Union had risen 36 percent since 1971, to at least 31 deaths per
thousand births, compared to 12 deaths per thousand births in the
United States.
   Soviet officials were aware of the problem, and had censored
infant mortality statistics from their publications since 1975. But
Feshbach unearthed data the censors missed.
   Lashing out at that they called ``lurid accounts'' appearing in
the West, Soviet officials called a news conference in Moscow to
claim the rise in infant mortality was due to better reporting. The
Soviets now acknowledge that health care needs improving.
   Feshbach has mined other Soviet secrets.
   In the mid-1960s, he reported the Soviets had a severe labor
shortage. Not until 1976 did Kremlin leaders admit that.
   He has been predicting for years that the exploding population
of Central Asia would pose problems, particularly in the military.
Recent Soviet articles have confirmed that the Central Asia
conscripts have trouble mastering the Russian language and the
complicated machinery of modern war.
   Among the puzzles Feshbach is working from the latest census is
the evacuation pattern after the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in
April 1986.
   ``We already know they evacuated 116,000 people. They told us
that,'' he said. Although preliminary data is sketchy, it shows a
marked migration from surrounding administrative regions, or
oblasts.
   Chernigovskaya oblast, with its administrative center 50 miles
due east of Chernobyl, lost 6 percent of its population.
Kirovgradskay oblast, 230 miles southeast of Chernobyl, lost one
percent of population.
   Vinnitskaya oblast, 180 miles southwest of Chernobyl, lost 6
percent of its population. Sumskaya oblast, centered 200 miles east
of Chernobyl, lost 2 percent of its population. Zhitomirskaya
oblast, 100 miles southwest of Chernobyl, lost 3 percent of its
population.

   Four South African anti-apartheid leaders are
seeking support from U.S. leaders for their plan for negotiations
with the white South African government to end its racial
segregation policies.
   The group, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, were to present their plan today on Capitol Hill to some 80
lawmakers, governors, business leaders and academics. They have
also asked to meet with President Bush.
   The blueprint includes ``constitutional principles for a
post-apartheid South Africa,'' said Randall Robinson, director of
TransAfrica, the lobbying group coordinating the visit. The South
African delegation also includes the Revs. Allan Boesak, Beyers
Naude and Frank Chikane.
   Robinson said the four will propose a detailed negotiating
process with their government. ``They hope to salvage the window of
opportunity that exists now for a negotiated settlement,'' he said
in an interview. ``It won't exist forever, and then there'll only
be bloodshed.''
   U.S. anti-apartheid leaders and government officials believe an
expected leadership change in South Africa means an opportunity to
engage in negotiations with the government on granting political
rights to the black majority.
   National Party leader F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to become
South Africa's next leader once President P.W. Botha retires in
September, has called for a new political system in his country,
although he rejects a one-person, one-vote system espoused by
anti-apartheid groups.
   There has been speculation de Klerk may come to the United
States for a visit later this year.
   State Department officials say the administration has decided to
broaden its contacts with South African leaders across the
political spectrum and that a de Klerk visit is possible.
   The proposals of the anti-apartheid leadership prompted
publication Tuesday of a Gallup survey showing most South Africans
oppose international economic sanctions because they believe the
sanctions lead to joblessness rather than political change.
   Only one in six blacks said sanctions are a good idea because
they would force the government to abolish apartheid. Six of 10
blacks said they would oppose sanctions even if these led the
government to resign within five years.
   The survey of 2,192 people _ 1,400 blacks, 392 whites and 400 of
mixed race and Asian origin _ was commissioned by the South African
Chamber of Mines, representing the country's mining industry.
   Of those polled, 82 percent of the blacks and 95 percent of the
whites rejected foreign sanctions, with most saying they would lead
to higher unemployment.
   Congress imposed limited sanctions on South Africa in 1986,
overriding a veto by then-President Reagan, in an effort to force
the government to grant political rights to the black majority.
   The survey, conducted between March 11 and May 8, had a 4
percent margin of error. Neil Upmeyer, research director for
Gallup, said that to ensure credibility of the responses,
interviews were conducted away from the work place by interviewers
who were of the same race as the respondent.
   In the survey, 59 percent of the blacks and 51 percent of the
whites, and 58 percent of all respondents, said American companies
in South Africa can help make the government moderate its racial
policies.
   Of those polled, 77 percent of blacks and 50 percent of whites
said ending American business operations would seriously hurt the
South African economy.

   Democratic and Republican governors pressed a
list of state concerns on President Bush and avoided any open
disagreement with the new administration following a private White
House meeting.
   Virginia's Gerald Baliles, chairman of the National Governors'
Association, said the governors called for federal action on
schools, the environment, roads, crime and welfare reform in their
session Tuesday.
   Bush responded by agreeing to call a national summit meeting on
education, Baliles said.
   ``Governors are realistic. They know these issues are not going
to be resolved in 100 days,'' Democrat Baliles said. ``But they're
also eager for results. We want to work with Washington, but we're
not waiting on Washington.''
   Iowa's Republican Gov. Terry Branstad said he urged more federal
effort to help Midwestern farmers deal with drought, and sought a
relaxation of new federal welfare regulations affecting the states.
   The rules, Branstad said, ``don't fit the spirit'' of the
welfare reform act.
   Thirteen governors, representing the National Governors'
Association, met with the president for 30 minutes in the Cabinet
Room.
   The meeting made up for one that was canceled in February
because Bush was out of the country during the governors' annual
Washington meeting. He will host a formal state dinner for the
governors Monday night.
   ``I think that he clearly understands that for his initiatives
to suceed he needs support from those who are working at the state
level,'' said Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, a Democrat.
   Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin said she encouraged Bush to support
strengthening the Clean Air Act and told him that ``delay is now
not acceptable'' on the issue. She said Bush ``seems to agree with
that fundamental message.''
   Branstad said he had first suggested a summit meeting of
governors and education leaders when Bush met with them after his
election in November. He said Bush voiced his intention to hold one
in September, including governors and state education chiefs.
   A recent report by Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos which
ranked the state's education efforts concluded that, overall,
education is not improving in the nation.
   Despite that, Branstad said, ``there are exciting and innovative
things happening in many of the states to deal with the education
problems of the nation, and this summit conference is going to give
us an opportunity to share them.''
   The governors released a report by their task force on research
and technology which said states and the federal government should
promote commercial applications of technological advances that are
necessary to make the United States more competitive with other
countries.
   It recommended a revision of federal antitrust laws to promote
joint research and development projects by businesses, and renewal
of the federal tax credit for research and development.
   Governors meeting with Bush were Democrats Baliles, Celeste,
Kunin, Mike Sullivan of Wyoming and Booth Gardner of Washington,
and Republicans Branstad, Michael Castle of Delaware, John Ashcroft
of Missouri, Norman Bangerter of Utah, Carroll Campbell of South
Carolina, Edward DiPrete of Rhode Island, Thomas Kean of New Jersey
and John McKernan of Maine.

   William Lucas, nominated by President Bush to
be the government's civil rights chief, reported receiving more
than half his salary income last year from earnings as a Republican
Party consultant.
   The nominee for assistant attorney general for civil rights
reported that $65,000 of his $125,500 in earnings came from the
Republican National Committee.
   Lucas, a black Republican whose nomination has drawn opposition
from several major civil rights groups, reported on a financial
disclosure form that he earned the money as a consultant chairing
the GOP's minority outreach committee.
   A former sheriff and chief executive of Wayne County, Mich., who
ran unsuccessfully for Michigan governor in 1986, Lucas worked to
recruit blacks into the GOP last year.
   A number of civil rights organizations, including the NAACP and
the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of 180
groups, question Lucas' professional qualifications to head the
Justice Department's civil rights division.
   Several other civil rights leaders, including Jesse Jackson,
support Lucas' nomination.
   On the financial disclosure form released Tuesday, Lucas
reported earning $25,000 in legal fees from two companies whose
officers benefited from a 1984 contract he approved to renovate an
historic public office building in downtown Detroit when he was
Wayne County's chief executive.
   Lucas was cleared of allegations made then that he had steered
the contract to the investment partnership because one of his top
aides was part owner of the construction firm hired to perform the
$25 million renovation.
   The law firm of Philip G. Tannian, a Detroit attorney who
represented the partnership that won the contract, paid Lucas
$10,000 in legal fees last year, according to the statement filed
with the Office of Government Ethics.
   Lucas also reported earning $15,000 in legal fees from Thorn
Apple Industries, whose president, Henry Dorfman, and vice
president, Louis Glazier, were investors in the partnership that
bought the city-county office building for $3 million.
   The contract was approved by the Wayne County Board of
Supervisors on Lucas' recommendation. It became a source of
controversy when one supervisor charged that Lucas had favored the
investment partnership because one of his aides, Dennis Nystrom,
was a shareholder in the construction company that would perform
the renovation.
   Tannian said a Wayne State University law professor hired by the
county to investigate the allegations found no evidence of
wrongdoing.
   Tannian said that when the investors selected the construction
company, there was ``no ownership interest'' by Nystrom. ``We
terminated the contract with that company within 24 hours of
finding out about that interest and went with another construction
company,'' he said.
   Tannian said he hired Lucas last year to help him represent 200
small companies involved in a Superfund pollution cleanup case
because Lucas ``is an absolute expert at dealing with people and
negotiations.''
   Lucas' disclosure form also reported a $28,000 salary from the
Detroit law firm of Evans and Luptak and a $7,500 director's fee
from the Detroit-based Armada Corp.
   He also reported receiving a $25,589 pension from Wayne County,
covering his service as sheriff and county executive.

   A cruise company whose luxury liner rammed
into a Cuban merchant vessel, killing its captain and two seamen,
is refusing to cooperate with federal investigators, according to
safety officials.
   A spokesman for Carnival Cruise Ship Lines, however, said the
Miami company is responding to investigators in Liberia, where its
vessel is registered, and accused the head of the National
Transportation Safety Board of making ``misleading and totally
irresponsible'' statements about the company.
   James L. Kolstad, acting board chairman, said Tuesday that
Carnival had refused to honor subpoenas for information and
witnesses related to the Feb. 10 collision between Carnival's
733-foot Celebration, which was carrying 2,251 people, and the
351-foot Capitan San Luis, a Cuban cement carrier.
   The San Luis, which was carrying a 45-member crew, split apart
and sank.
   ``We are especially concerned,'' said Kolstad, ``with any
American-based company using U.S. ports and carrying thousands of
U.S. citizens each year, refusing to cooperate _ for whatever
reason _ with our nation's chief accident investigation agency
looking into situations that could result in a catastrophic loss of
life.''
   Kolstad said the company's refusal ``raises serious questions
about whether this company wants to provide the highest available
levels of safety protection for its passengers.''
   He said the board would continue to ``vigorously pursue'' its
investigation into the accident.
   A board investigator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the board is concerned that the foreign registry of ships will be
used to hinder future investigations into accidents that could
involve the loss of American lives aboard a ship operated by an
American company.
   The board has no judicial power and relies on the cooperation of
parties involved in its investigations. It determines the probable
cause of accidents and makes recommendations for government and
private action to improve safety.
   Carnival spokesman Tim Gallagher declined to say whether the
company had refused to provide the safety board with any
information, saying, ``We are fully cooperating with the
appropriate authority in the investigation, which is the Bureau of
Maritime Affairs, Republic of Liberia.''
   None of the 1,580 passengers or 671 crew members aboard the
cruise ship was injured in the collision. The ship lowered
lifeboats to rescue 42 surviving Cuban crewmembers, but the San
Luis captain and two other crewmembers were lost at sea.
   Carnival Cruise, which was established in 1974, owns seven ships
and carried about 579,000 passengers, mostly Americans, last year
on cruises around the Caribbean, the Bahamas and the Mexican
Riviera.
   The cruise ship, which was returning from a seven-day Caribbean
cruise, had an 18-inch gash in its side and black scrape marks on
its bow.
   The San Luis was en route from Havana to Tenerife in the Canary
Islands for repairs, and was reported adrift in the predawn water
without lights when it was hit.
   Authorities said the San Luis was struck in the rear deckhouse,
which separated and sank almost immediately. The bow section
remained afloat for several hours before it sank.
   Cuban authorities questioned the Celebration's Italian captain,
Rafaele Gravino, who later said the Cuban vessel was drifting in a
major shipping channel.
   Cruise officials said the Celebration had three operating radar
systems, and an officer who checked the radar 20 minutes before the
crash saw nothing in the ship's path.
   Gavino told a news conference at the time that radar is checked
frequently when there is no visibility but ``when there is good
visibility, you are supposed to see the lights of the other ship.''
   Cuba's official news agency, Prensa Latina, quoted the San Luis'
helmsman as saying the ship tried to warn the Celebration to
maneuver and avoid the accident.

   Voters endorsed a plan to replace cramped
Stapleton International Airport, the nation's fifth busiest, with a
new airport more than 20 miles from downtown.
   With all of the city's 459 precincts reporting, the referendum
had passed by 70,122 votes to 41,754 votes, a 63-to-37 percent
margin.
   ``This is a victory for the city and the people of Denver,''
said a jubilant Denver Mayor Federico Pena, who had campaigned hard
for the referendum.
   ``It gives us direction,'' said Gov. Roy Romer, another strong
backer of the measure. ``It says we have a future and we're going
to claim it.''
   Opponents of the new airport said they were not surprised by the
vote. Dick Young and Bill Chenoweth, two of the most prominent
opponents, said they would not attempt to throw further roadblocks
in the airport's path.
   ``The election was sold on the basis it (the airport) will
create instant jobs. A lot of people are hurting, and they bought
that,'' Young said.
   The new airport, which would cost an estimated $2.3 billion,
would be the first new U.S. airport since Dallas-Fort Worth
International opened in 1974.
   The referendum was non-binding, although Pena has said the city
would abide by the results.
   The referendum would authorize the city to secure federal grants
and sell bonds, then begin four years of construction later this
year on 53 square miles of city-owned prairie.
   Airlines maintained low profiles during the referendum campaign,
but on Tuesday night, Continental spokesman Ned Walker warned that
funding for the airport was far from certain.
   ``Unfortunately, the referendum may actually have set the new
airport back because it excludes the use of city taxes as a
component of the project financing plan. It did nothing to solve
the main problem, and that is _ where will Denver find the $2.3
billion it now says the new airport will cost?'' Walker said.

   Supporters argued that Stapleton, built in 1929, has a limited
capacity to expand and has gotten a bad reputation for delays.
   The new airport design calls for two concourses with 94 boarding
gates, which could be expanded to 120. Stapleton has 94 gates. Its
five runways would be built in a configuration differing from
Stapleton's four parallel runways.
   Federal Aviation Administration regulations currently force the
closure of Stapleton's runways when visibility is low, causing
nationwide flight delays.
   Supporters also said the project would bring a bonanza of
construction jobs and spinoff development that would make Denver a
mid-continent hub for wholesale, shipping and telecommunications
companies.
   Opponents scoffed at that and also said the project was too
risky, given Denver's sagging economy and turmoil in the airline
industry.
   ``What kind of business would locate in an area just because
they have a huge airport? I don't see the airport driving economic
growth. I think economic growth drives the airport size,'' said
former state Attorney General J.D. MacFarlane, who campaigned
against the new irport.
   Opponents also contended the proposal was driven not by need,
but by the political ambitions of the mayor and Gov. Roy Romer and
by opportunistic land developers, consultants and investment
bankers.

   The military chief of staff and air
force commander were killed Tuesday as they took part in a failed
coup attempt, the Marxist government's official radio reported.
   It said in its report Wednesday that most of the other officers
involved had surrendered and the capital was calm.
   Shooting began out in the capital several hours after President
Mengistu Haile Mariam, in power for nearly 15 years, left the
capital Tuesday with his wife for a visit to East Germany.
   Troops and tanks surrounded the presidential palace, the Defense
Ministry and other government buildings. The airport was closed and
communications cut.
   Some military officers have opposed Mengistu's continued effort
to fight a stalemated 28-year-old war against rebels in the north.
   Goverment radio reported the capital quiet on Wednesday:
   ``Some conspiring generals wanted to create great unrest and
disturbance, to shed the blood of innocent people and generally
destabilize the unity of our motherland, even though their
treacherous aims did not succeed.''
   Addis Ababa radio said: ``They tried to use force but were
killed. They are 1. Maj. Gen. Merid Negusie, who was chief of
staff. 2. Maj. Gen. Amha Desta, commander of the Air Force.''
   ``Most of the conspiring generals have been forced to
surrender,'' it said.
   The radio, monitored in Nairobi, Kenya, gave no other immediate
details.
   Two air force jet fighters and then a half dozen military
helicopters had circled the capital on Tuesday, but there were no
indications they opened fire.
   Air traffic controllers at the airport could be heard by radio
monitors diverting flights to the small country of Djibouti about
200 miles to the northeast.
   One controller told a pilot: ``No explanations. No
explanations.''
   Four hours after the shooting started, Addis Ababa radio
broadcast a statement from the ruling State Council that said the
coup attempt had been quashed. The statement was broadcast four
times before the radio went off the air for the night.
   The shooting began at about 4 p.m. Tuesday with gunfire at the
Defense Ministry. A civilian inside, contacted by telephone by The
Associated Press, said there was ``an apparent division'' among top
officers in the ruling military.
   The employee, who insisted on anonymity, said leaders of the two
sides were negotiating.
   ``I don't know what we've got, quite frankly,'' said a spokesman
at the U.S. Embassy.
   Allen Collins, a diplomat at the British Embassy, said: ``I
cannot comment on what's going on. We are trying to make our own
assessment and any comment would be premature.''
   There have been persistent reports of military unrest, with the
government engaged in wars against separate rebel groups seeking
autonomy in the northernmost provinces of Tigre and Eritrea.
   Government forces have been pushed out of most of Eritrea and
Tigre provinces recently in humiliating defeats by guerrillas of
the Eritrean People's Liberation Army and the Tigre People's
Liberation Army.
   The Eritrean secessionists began their struggle against the
government 28 years ago, and in the past year the two groups joined
forces in the battle against the government.
   One diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``I
haven't heard of any deep divisions within the high command.
   ``What one does get a feeling for is a disenchantment within the
officer ranks generally with what appears to be an unwinnable war
in the north.''
   The State Council announcement said, ``At this time when the
people of Ethiopia have been liberated from the feudal system ...
and particularly when they have established a system whereby they
can administer themselves through the recent constitution, the
central government and in the various administrative areas of our
country, a few generals and officers attempted to topple the
government and install a military regime today, but their attempt
failed.''
   It did not name the forces that it said were waiting to divide
the country.
   The military deposed Emperor Haile Selassie in a coup on Sept.
12, 1974, and a provisional military government was established.
After fighting among factions in the armed forces, Mengistu, then
an army major, came to power that November and set up a military
government with close ties to the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Affluent Teen-Agers Blamed on Attacks on Homosexuals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of affluent teen-age
``skinheads'' suspected in attacks on up to two dozen homosexual
men boasted to police after their arrest in a park, authorities
said.
   ``We're still shaking our heads at how freely they talked about
their actions,'' Deputy Police Chief Terrence Rickard said Tuesday.
``It's a sad commentary on our society.''
   The loose-knit group calls itself the Buffalo Rochester Aryan
Skinheads, or B.R.A.S.H., and its 10 members live in affluent
neighborhoods in the Rochester area.
   ``We didn't even know this group existed until we arrested them
and they told us who they were,'' Rickard said. ``The officers who
made the arrests were amazed and disgusted at what they were
saying.''
   He said he knew skinhead groups had caused trouble elsewhere,
but he was surprised to find one in this northwestern New York city.
   Police learned of the group when undercover officers stopped an
attack Friday night in Highland Park, which Rickard said is a
popular meeting place for homosexuals. The youths, two age 16 and
the others 18 and 19, were arrested and charged with beating a
30-year-old man.
   The eight were jailed over the weekend. Seven were released on
$250 bail Monday. The other was released on his own recognizance.
   Each was charged with second-degree robbery, second-degree
assault and fourth-degree grand larceny, which carry maximum
penalties of five to 15 years in prison. The 16-year-olds are being
charged as adults.
   In his statement to police, one of the group's leaders,
16-year-old Timothy Waite, of Rochester, said, ``Basically, what we
believe is that we do not like blacks or homosexuals.''
   Rickard said it appears the attacks were only against
homosexuals.
   Another suspect, 16-year-old Andrew Johnroe of nearby Pittsford,
told police: ``Gay bashing is when we lure a gay guy into our path
and jump him. Sometimes his wallet gets stolen, but most of the
time, we just beat him up real bad.''
   The attacks outraged homosexual-rights activists.
   ``We will not tolerate violence against gay people,'' said
Claire Parker, president of the Gay Alliance of the Genesee Valley.
``If we have to patrol the parks to ensure our safety, we will.''
   Activist Martin Hiraga said attacks against homosexuals go
unreported because the victims don't want their homosexuality
revealed. He said assailants have been known to meet homosexual men
at bars and lure them into the park, where they are beaten. Other
times, homosexual men have been attacked in parked cars or as they
walk through the park.
   Rickard said none of the members of the group actually have
shaved heads, a trademark of the skinhead movement. He said the
group has nothing to do with Buffalo, which is 75 miles west of
Rochester.
   The skinhead subculture emerged in working class neighborhoods
in England as early as the 1960s.

   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ The Defense Ministry has accused the Contra
rebels of killing, kidnapping and torturing civilians in a series
of attacks this week.
   A cease-fire has been in place for more than a year, but both
the leftist Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed rebels, most
of whom are said to be in base camps in neighboring Honduras,
accuse each other of violations.
   The ministry said Tuesday that one civilian was killed, three
were wounded and 15 were kidnapped Sunday in a rebel attack on the
community of El Solano, 180 miles east of Managua in Zelaya Sur
province.
   Rebels also attacked a farm cooperative called Chalmeca in the
same area and kidnapped 15 peasants on Sunday, the ministry said.
   A day earlier, rebels killed one soldier and wounded three
others in a skirmish in Chontales province, it said.
   The ministry said that on May 10, rebels kidnapped, tortured and
killed two brothers in Amerisque, a town about six miles east of
Juigalpa, the capital of Chontales province.
   The next day, rebels intercepted a civilian vehicle near El
Triunfo, 185 miles west of Managua and killed a young passenger who
had served in the Sandinista army, the ministry said.
   The statement, one of the ministry's periodic summaries of
fighting, said the civil war has claimed 488 lives since Jan. 1. It
did not break down the toll into civilians, government troops and
rebels.

   Pennsylvania voters overwhelmingly rejected a tax reform plan
Tuesday that would have raised their income taxes, and Denver
residents endorsed plans to build a new $2 billion airport.
   In Pittsburgh, a self-described ``Jewish grandmother'' won the
Democratic mayoral primary, making her a strong favorite to win her
first full term as mayor.
   Seattle voters approved an initiative to limit downtown growth
with a 450-foot height limit on new buildings. With 26 percent of
the precincts reporting, the vote was 12,899 to 7,964, a 62-to-38
percent margin.
   Oregon residents rejected a proposal for a new tax system, and
in Tucson, Ariz., voters appeared to be approving a $398 million
school bond package that was 10 times more expensive than one they
rejected last year.
   In Pittsburgh, incumbent Sophie Masloff, 71, beat state Rep.
Thomas J. Murphy Jr. and three other rivals for the Democratic
nomination for a four-year term.
   With 98 percent of the precincts reporting, Mrs. Masloff had 28
percent to 23 percent for Murphy and 21 percent for Allegheny
County controller Frank Luccino. Two others divided the remainder.
   Mayoral primaries were held in several other cities, including
Erie, Pa., and Jackson, Miss.
   In Erie, Joyce Savocchio, a second-term councilwoman and a high
school assistant principal, defeated five opponents to win the
city's first wide-open Democratic mayoral primary in two decades, a
race to succeed six-term Mayor Louis J. Tullio.
   In Jackson, state Rep. Kane Ditto defeated three-term incumbent
Dale Danks Jr. in the Democratic runoff. Danks had been considered
a slight favorite.
   In all three cities the Democratic primary victor would be
heavily favored to win the general election.
   Lancaster, Pa., set the stage for the election of its first
female mayor in its 247-year history. Women won both the Republican
and Democratic primaries.
   Denver's ballot issue asked voters whether 60-year-old Stapleton
International Airport should be replaced with a new facility 17
miles away. With all precincts reporting, the referendum had passed
by 70,122 votes to 41,754 votes, a 63-to-37 percent margin.
   Pennsylvania officials offered voters a swap of sorts _ lower
property taxes if they would approve a measure allowing counties to
impose an income tax. But voters, apparently fearing that the plan
would lead to higher taxes, turned it down.
   With 78 percent of the state's precincts reporting, 382,570
votes were cast supporting the plan, or 26 percent, and 1,107,570
against it, or 74 percent. Opposition was especially strong in
Philadelphia.
   With 78 percent of the state's precincts reporting, the vote was
382,570 votes for the plan, or 26 percent, to 1,107,570 against it,
or 74 percent. Opposition was especially strong in Philadelphia.
   In Oregon, voters turned down a new property tax formula that
offered help to financially ailing school districts. With 52
percent of the precincts reporting, the plan had been rejected by a
60-to-40 percent margin.

   The vote in Denver came after years of debate over what to do
about Stapleton, the nation's fifth-busiest airport.
   Supporters of the non-binding ballot issue, including federal
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, argued that Stapleton was
obsolete and strained beyond its capacity. Opponents, who hired
political consultant Roger Ailes to produce their advertising, said
the new airport would be a waste of money.
   The cost of a new airport has been estimated at $1.7 billion to
$2.3 billion.
   Seattle's downtown growth initiative was prompted by concerns
over the ``Manhattanization'' of Seattle, whose skyline includes a
76-story building and 10 others that are taller than 450 feet.
   Opponents in the business community argued that the measure
would rein in economic development.
   Pennsylvania's ballot issue was intended to give local
authorities greater flexibility in setting tax rates, but it
stirred strong opposition from those who opposed an increase in the
income tax.
   Both mayor's races in Pennsylvania sought successors to men who
contracted the rare heart disease amyloidosis.
   Mrs. Masloff, who likes to use the ``Jewish grandmother'' tag as
part of her folksy image, was City Council president last year when
she was appointed to fill the vacancy left by the death of Mayor
Richard S. Caliguiri.
   Lucchino, 50, a third-term controller and former city
councilman, tried to counter Mrs. Masloff's appeal with the image
of a no-nonsense administrator.
   In Erie, Tullio announced he was retiring after he became ill
with amyloidosis, which causes a fatal protein buildup in the heart.

<HEAD>FDA Says Banned Artificial Sweetener May Make Comeback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The artificial sweetener cyclamate may find
its way back on the market after being banned for 20 years as a
suspected carcinogen, but probably not before next year, the Food
and Drug Administration says.
   The FDA said Tuesday it is continuing a review of the sweetener,
commenting in response to a Washington Post story that quoted an
FDA official as saying the agency ``made a mistake'' in banning
cyclamate.
   The agency has been considering lifting the cyclamate ban since
1982, and though studies have challenged initial claims that the
sweetener causes bladder cancer, other safety concerns remain.
   ``The final studies aren't expected until summer and fall, and
then the FDA would have to review that data and there would have to
be some time for public comment, so it may be hard to get all that
completed this year, and that's assuming the studies are
favorable,'' said FDA spokesman Bill Grigg.
   Among the concerns are cyclamate's effects on blood pressure and
whether it causes genetic damage, testicular atrophy or promotes
tumor growth.
   The Post quoted Robert Scheuplein, acting director of the office
of toxicological services for the FDA's Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition, as saying: ``I have no reluctance in saying that
with cyclamate we made a mistake.''
   Calls seeking comment from Scheuplein were referred to the FDA's
press office, and spokesman Emil Corwin said no interviews would be
granted.
   Grigg declined to comment directly on Scheuplein's remark, but
noted the FDA ``said as far back as 1973 that if the larger (base
of) data showed that the early data on which we based the decision
(to ban cyclamate) were faulty, that we would reverse it.''
   Scheuplein's comment was encouraging to the Calorie Control
Council, an industry group representing soft drink and dietetic
food manufacturers that has been seeking to reintroduce cyclamate.
   ``We look forward to reapproval as soon as possible,'' said
council spokesman Keith Keeney.
   The council and Abbott Laboratories of North Chicago, Ill., the
major producer of cyclamate, in 1982 filed the latest of many
petitions to the FDA for reconsideration of the ban.
   Cyclamate was first used in foods and beverages in the early
1950s, before enactment of a law later that decade requiring
pre-market review of food additives. It was banned in 1969, and the
FDA reaffirmed that ban in 1976 and 1980.
   The FDA's Cancer Assessment Committee concluded in 1985 that
cyclamate does not by itself cause cancer. In a report later that
year, the National Academy of Sciences said cyclamate does not
cause cancer but may play a secondary role that should be examined
more closely.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest took issue with
the findings of the reports. Spokeswoman Lisa Lefferts said ``I'm
not sure the jury's in on cancer,'' and the center has further
concerns about the possibility that cyclamate causes testicular
atrophy, inhibits growth and damages chromosomes.
   ``We don't think FDA is likely to reverse its decision on
cyclamate. If they do they're going to have to make a lot of
evidence disappear,'' Lefferts said.
   The most common non-sugar sweeteners used in the United States
are aspartame, or Nutrasweet, and saccharin. The FDA proposed to
ban saccharin in 1977 because it is suspected of causing cancer,
but Congress has allowed it to continue on the market with a
cancer-related warning label.
   The FDA last year approved acesulfame potassium, or Sunette, as
a calorie-free sweetener for table use, and for chewing gum, dry
beverage mixes, instant coffee and tea, gelatins, puddings and
non-dairy creamers.

   The National Institutes of Health is settling
a suit by adopting a requirement that opens deliberations and votes
on human gene research to the public.
   The suit filed Jan. 30 by a private foundation challenged the
first planned introduction of a foreign gene into human beings, an
experiment which will be conducted on 10 patients who are
terminally ill with melanoma, a skin cancer.
   The experiment may take place later this week, Jeremy Rifkin,
president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, said Tuesday after
the court settlement was reached.
   The foundation and Rifkin filed the suit against Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan and NIH director James
Wyngaarden.
   Rifkin said the settlement clears the way for the experiment.
However, the experiment was not held up on account of the lawsuit,
asserted Margot de Ferranti, a Justice Department lawyer who
defended the government in the case. She said NIH has been in the
process of finding terminally ill cancer patients to participate in
the experiment.
   U.S. District Judge John G. Penn signed the agreement dismissing
the suit, which alleged the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee
approved the experiment on melanoma patients without conducting
proper public hearings.
   Under the agreement, the committee must hold all future
deliberations and votes in public sessions.
   Sullivan approved amendments to the DNA committee's charter
containing the requirement.
   A knowledgeable NIH official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the committee's deliberations and voting ordinarily
are open to the public. He said the panel had earlier approved the
experiment in open session, but then conducted a mailed ballot as a
reconfirmation of that decision.
   ``The changes in the charter spell out an orderly process of
review,'' NIH spokeswoman Anne Thomas said in a statement. ``Some
of the changes were suggested by Dr. Wyngaarden with the
concurrence'' of the committee. ``We are pleased that this has been
resolved,'' she added.
   ``This will be the first major medical technology in which the
public will be allowed to fully participate in the review
process,'' said Rifkin. ``We hope it will set a precedent. Other
countries look to the United States for the lead.''
   Rifkin said the settlement allows ``active participation.
Organizations like mine can propose amendments (to proposed
experiments) in advance that then have to be put on the agenda,
that have to be voted on by that committee.''
   However, the public has long had an opportunity to participate
and make its views known to the committee, including the right to
propose amendments to the guidelines, said the NIH official.
   Rifkin and his group said a review of the original proposal by a
subcommittee wasn't conducted with public notice and public
participation and that final approval by the full committee was by
a mailed ballot, instead of in public. Under the agreement, the
subcommittee sessions may still be conducted privately.
   The DNA committee approved research in January to introduce into
melanoma patients a type of immune cell, called tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes, that has been genetically altered.
   In earlier work, three NIH researchers showed that TIL cells can
be used to battle cancer by taking them from a patient's tumor,
growing them in large numbers, and reinserting them into a patient.
The technique was at least partially successful in 12 of 20
patients.
   The scientists now want to trace the white blood cells after
they are returned to the patient to understand why TIL therapy
works for some, but not others. To do this, they want to mark the
cells with a bacterial gene that produces a resistance to neomycin,
an antibiotic. In this way, cells from the patient's tumors or
blood stream could be identified and movement of the cells into the
tumors could be monitored.
   To get the gene of the bacteria into the white blood cells, the
scientists propose to use a mouse leukemia retrovirus.

<TEXT>
   Stringent record-keeping requirements in a
child anti-pornography statute are unconstitutional, according to a
federal judge who said the restrictions infringe on First Amendment
rights.
   U.S. District Judge George Revercomb on Tuesday handed down the
decision on the 1988 Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement
Act, which requires publishers and distributors to document the
ages of nude models in photographs.
   Under the law, models and performers must be contacted to
determine if they were at least 18 years old at the time the
photograph or film was made. The requirements cover the reissue of
images first made after Feb. 6, 1978, the date of the chief federal
law criminalizing child pornography, said the judge.
   The requirements ``have not been narrowly tailored to fit the
legitimate governmental interest of stopping child pornography,''
Revercomb said in a 43-page decision. They ``burden too heavily and
infringe too deeply'' on the right to produce material protected by
the First Amendment, he wrote.
   ``The result of the requirement ... will undoubtedly be the
effective prohibition of the distribution of much First Amendment
protected material,'' the opinion said.
   The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the American Library
Association.
   Revercomb also found unconstitutional companion requirements
providing for a presumption of criminality by those who fail to
abide by record-keeping requirements.
   Proof that a person being prosecuted for a child porn offense
failed to keep the proper records ``shall raise a rebuttable
presumption that such performer was a minor,'' according to the law.
   Revercomb said the criminal presumptions raise the ``serious
potential'' for convicting people who have not engaged in child
pornography.
   The judge also found unconstitutional parts of a civil provision
in the child pornography law and portions of a criminal forfeiture
provision allowing seizure of materials before conviction.
   The provisions allow forfeiture of property used to promote the
commission of an offense. Revercomb blocked the government from
enforcing the provisions unless there has been a prior adversarial
proceeding.
   The court also enjoined the government from enforcing the
post-conviction forfeiture provisions of the law unless there has
been a ``pattern'' of activity.
   ``The laws at issue here appear to authorize forfeiture of vast
amounts of assets _ everything from First Amendment protected
material to bank accounts _ for a single violation,'' said the
judge.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said the department was
``still reviewing the opinion and studying its impact'' and had no
further immediate comment.
   Bruce Ennis, an attorney representing the American Library
Association, said last month the law puts near-impossible
record-keeping burdens on legitimate businesses. It would impose a
``corporate death penalty'' on distributors because all assets
could be seized if they violate the law with even one publication,
Ennis said.

<HEAD>Bryant Wants To Stop Clearcutting In National Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. John Bryant is seeking to severely
restrict the practice of clear-cutting in national forests, calling
the timber harvesting method irresponsible and wasteful.
   But the U.S. Forest Service and industry representatives say
clear-cutting timber is a valuable forest management tool and is
vital to maintaining habitat for certain species of wildlife.
   ``Clear-cutting ignores the need for natural species diversity
as a requirement for a healthy forest environment,'' Bryant,
D-Texas, said Tuesday.
   He was referring to the practice of cutting down all the trees
in an area, rather than selectively picking trees to fell.
   ``A live, healthy forest is replaced after a clear-cut with a
single species of tree plantation, which forest experts believe
loses its immunity to natural infestations of tree-killing pests,
such as the Southern pine beetle,'' Bryant said.
   Bryant introduced legislation to prohibit clear-cutting in any
national forest in which one-tenth of the acreage of available
commercial timberland has already been harvested by clear-cutting.
Many national forests would be affected, he said.
   The Forest Service would be required to replace clear-cutting
with ``selection-management'' harvesting techniques, in which only
certain trees are removed from a stand and a diversity of plants
remain.
   Although backed by some environmentalists, Bryant acknowledged a
tough fight ahead and intense pressure from timber industry
lobbyists to ``prevent a serious hearing'' on the bill.
   Last year, 283,061 acres of national forest were clear-cut,
Bryant said. National forests cover 191 million acres, of which 61
million are classified as suitable for timber production.
   Dave Hessel, director of timber management at the Forest
Service, said clear-cutting is valuable in ``maintaining not only
species diversity but also in its relationship to maintaining
wildlife habitat needs.''
   Hessel said clear-cutting is needed for stands of trees that
require sunlight to develop, like the lodgepole pine. Lodgepole
pine forests provide the habitat for big game species like elk in
the Rocky Mountains.
   The roughly 300,000 acres that are clearcut represent about half
the acreage harvested in national forests, but produce 75 percent
of the volume, Hessel said.
   Mark Rey, vice president for public forestry at National Forest
Products Association, said clear-cutting is not inconsistent with
high wildlife values, species diversity, and multiple uses for
forests.
   Rey also contends the bill would ``indisputably reduce the
amount of timber production potential the lands can have'' because
some species must have sunlight to regenerate.

<BYLINE>U.N. Agency: Government Investment In Women Is Key To Population
Control ^Eds: To CORRECT to 14 billion, SUB 5th graf, `Without such ...
social upheaval.'' Picks up 6th, `Nations with ...' ^By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women hold the key to economic development and
slower population growth but many are trapped by cultural values
and fundamentalist religions that put men first, the head of the
U.N. Population Fund says.
   Dr. Nafis Sadik of Pakistan issued the agency's 1989 State of
World Population Report on Tuesday and called for a fivefold
increase in world spending on family planning. She said governments
should put population control on a par with major economic
investments.
   With the world's population at 5.2 billion and current growth at
90 million people a year the United Nations forecasts a stable
population of 10 billion about a hundred years from now.
   ``But this will not happen unless more of the world's women are
given more health care, family planning services, education and
employment opportunities,'' Mrs. Sadik told a news conference.
   Without such measures, she said, the world's population could
nearly triple to 14 billion by the year 2100, crippling development
and creating ``enormous potential for violence and social
upheaval.''
   Nations with fast-growing populations are spending more on
essentials and have little left for social programs, Mrs. Sadik
said. In the past four years, 37 of the world's poorest countries
have cut health spending by 50 percent and education spending by 25
percent, she said.
   About half the world's women live in rural areas and in
societies dominated by men and still don't have access to family
planning, she said.
   South Korea, Singapore and Thailand are economic successes
partly because strong family planning programs helped reduce high
rates of population growth, Mrs. Sadik said.
   ``We know from the World Fertility Survey that women would have
fewer children if they had access to family planning,'' she said.
   ``In Latin America, 75 percent of women not using family
planning say they want to postpone, delay or limit their
childbearing. In Asia, the figure is 43 percent and in Africa 27
percent.''
   To stabilize the world's population at 10 billion, population
growth must decline by one-third in the next 40 years, the report
says.
   Mrs. Sadik said the U.N. Population Fund set a goal of extending
family planning services to an additional 500 million women by the
year 2000 and raise the number of contraceptive users from 465
million today to 730 million.
   The fund, which has projects in 130 countries, urged governments
to earmark at least 1 percent of gross national product for family
planning.
   Mrs. Sadik also called for a great expansion in women's
education and literacy, an end to legal and social discrimination
against women and greater access to leadership positions for women.
   She said that even many educated men do not see a need for
equality and opportunity and that religious fundamentalism seems
``to be designed to somehow keep women in bondage.''
   Mrs. Sadik mentioned Pope John Paul II and Moslem
fundamentalists, but said, ``All religious movements look at the
woman as the one who should cater to and serve the family, never
the other gender.''

<HEAD>Singapore Minister Urges U.S. Asian Presence With Hands off Internal
Affairs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should maintain a strong
military presence in East Asia but avoid trying to ``make over
other peoples in her own image,'' says a Singapore cabinet minister
who is the son of Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew.
   The United States tends to consider itself a moral example to
the rest of the world and has a ``moral-legal'' approach to foreign
policy, Lee Hsien Loong told the Asia Society Tuesday night.
   But it is questionable ``whether U.S. political values and
institutions are universal commandments which apply to all
mankind,'' he added. ``American efforts to make over other peoples
in her own image have not been successful in Asia.''
   Lee, 37, a reserve brigadier general, minister of trade and
industry and deputy defense minister, was introduced as
representative of the new generation of political leaders in the
prosperous Southeast Asian city-state.
   He defended Singapore policies that have drawn criticism from
the U.S. government and from human rights organizations _ the use
of preventive arrest against suspected subversives and restrictions
on the foreign press.
   It is questionable whether the U.S. bill of rights ``is the
right model'' for the ``fragile society'' of Singapore, he said,
restating arguments his father, the prime minister, has used to
defend arrests and press controls as means of averting violence
among the country's diverse ethnic groups.
   Answering audience questions, many about human rights, he said
reports that Singapore police torture government critics are
exaggerated.
   Despite differences between the two countries, ``to Singapore,
the U.S. is a benevolent power,'' Lee said.
   Lee said America ``should maintain a military presence in the
region for as long as possible'' because it ``will keep the
influence of the Soviet Union in check, make it unnecessary for
Japan to rearm and balance Peoples Republic of China forces ...''
   However, the United States should keep hands off the internal
affairs of the countries of the region, he continued, because,
``despite its towering achievements, the American civilization is
not a universally valid model.
   ``The export of American values and culture has not always
worked,'' not even in countries such as the Philippines and South
Korea, he said.
   In the Philippines, U.S.-style constitutional government based
on checks and balances between branches of government ``was already
malfunctioning'' before the era of deposed President Ferdinand
Marcos, Lee said.
   ``An American style free-wheeling press, purveying junk in the
marketplace of ideas, led to confusion and bewilderment, not to
enlightenment and truth'' in the Philippines, Lee said.
   After Marcos was ousted in 1985, he continued, ``the Filipino
press has reverted to their old irresponsible and irrepressible
ways. Today, many thoughtful Filipinos wonder whether their
association with the U.S. was a stunting or a liberating
experience.''

   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has decided to restore
funding beginning June 1 to a subsidized low-income housing program
he canceled last month.
   Testifying for the second day before the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on HUD and independent agencies, Kemp also said the
Department of Housing and Urban Development would issue new
guidelines to ensure competitiveness and more equitable
distribution of funds in the scandal-plagued moderate
rehabilitation program.
   ``I've asked my general counsel to prepare for the Federal
Register by June 1 the notification of fund availability,'' said
Kemp. ``We want to make sure that the good guys ... are not
squeezed out of the system by political influence.''
   Kemp suspended the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program on
April 26 after an audit by the HUD inspector general revealed
several former HUD and other government officials were consultants
to public housing authorities obtaining grants to renovate and
repair subsidized housing for low-income families.

   Samuel W. Keller, a veteran NASA official, has
been named to the No. 3 job in the space agency.
   His appointment as associate deputy administrator was one of the
first actions by the acting head of NASA, Richard Truly, who
assumed the job Monday.
   ``I will be filling other top jobs as quickly as I can,'' said
Truly, whose own confirmation hearings are to begin soon. ``I
intend to do all that I can to ensure that NASA continues to
maintain and attract a team dedicated to excellence.''
   Keller, deputy associate administrator for space science and
applications since December 1977, succeeds Dr. Noel W. Hinners, one
of several NASA officials who resigned recently because of new
post-employment laws and the failure of a pay raise to pass
Congress.
   President Bush nominated J.R. Thompson, head of the Marshall
Space Flight Center, for the deputy administrator's position, also
left vacant by a recent resignation. That nomination also is
pending confirmation.

<NOTE>New NHTSA Safety Probes Involve More Than 4 Million Cars, Trucks</NOTE>

   Brake problems accounted for about half the
new safety defect investigations opened in April by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Admistration.
   Altogether, the agency said Tuesday it had started 10 new
preliminary evaluations, the lowest level of probe, into alleged
problems involving more than 4 million cars and trucks made by
major automakers both in the United States and abroad.
   Alleged brake defects were the complaint that brought 2 million
of the vehicles under NHTSA's scrutiny.
   NHTSA said it was investigating 26 reports that the brakes in
1.5 million General Motors Corp. light trucks tend to pull to the
left or right. The models involved are the 1984-1986 C123, K1 and
K2; the 1987-1988 R123, V1 and V2; and the 1984-1988 G123 pickup
trucks.
   The 75,000 1988 Pontiac Lemans, according to six complaints, is
prone to weak braking. The complaints included one accident with
four injuries.

<NOTE>Summer Gas Prices Seen 10 Percent Higher Than Last Year</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices are likely to rise four cents
more a gallon by summer, and the supply outlook is unclear, a
government agency says.
   The Energy Information Administration said Tuesday that prices
for all grades are likely to average $1.09 a gallon, up from $1.05
now. The average price last summer was 99 cents a gallon, the
report said.
   Prices rose sharply immediately after the March 24 Exxon oil
tanker spill in Alaska, which caused a brief drop in shipments of
North Slope crude oil, but then stabilized.
   The additional price increases by summer will reflect a recent
rise in crude oil prices paid by refiners and an estimated 1 cent
per gallon increase in state gasoline taxes, the report said.
   Also putting upward pressure on prices should be the usual
summertime jump in gasoline demand, reaching a level 1.9 percent
higher than last summer, the agency said.
   The report said that while gasoline supplies currently are
adequate, a squeeze could develop this summer if increased import
requirements cannot be met. It said one-half of the anticipated
increase in gasoline demand would have to be met by imports.

<NOTE>Pacifier, Christmas Decoration Recalled</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Christmas stocking decoration and a pacifier
holder that could pose choking hazards for children are being
recalled, the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced.
   Neither has been involved in any injuries, officials said
Tuesday.
   The recall covers about 3,600 ``Mother's Helper'' pacifier
holders sold nationwide from October 1987 to August 1988, the
agency said.
   The recalled pacifier holders have a metal clip for fastening
the device to an infant's clothing. The metal clip could pose a
choking hazard if it separated from the rest of the holder, the
commission said.
   Embossed on the back are the words ``Mother's Helper 1986 Steven
Barrie &amp; Company.'' Consumers should return the holders to the
store where purchased for a refund or send them to Steven Barrie &amp;
Co., 1055A Louis Drive, Warminster, Pa., 18970.
   The second recall involves a Christmas stocking decorated with a
teddy bear and two small bells. The bells could come loose and
choke a child, the commission said.
   About 4,400 of the stockings, made of red and white furry
material and topped with the teddy bear head, were sold last
Christmas season, officials said.
   These can be returned to the retailer for a refund, the
commission said. Consumers may contact the Jerry Elsner Company,
Bronx, N.Y., at 1-800-223-4119 for additional information.

<DATELINE>HOWARD AIR FORCE BASE, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carrying suitcases, baby
bottles and stuffed animals, the families of U.S. military
personnel in Panama boarded a chartered Air Force jet that took
them away from a home and friends.
   ``It's just like another part of your family leaving,'' said
Regina Brown, who came to the air base Tuesday to see off her
friends Amos and Twyla Walker.
   ``My dad was in the service,'' said Ms. Brown. ``I'm used to it,
but then again I'm not.''
   She said one of the Walkers' three children was her son's best
friend.
   The Walkers were among 238 military personnel and dependents who
left Panama on Tuesday aboard a chartered L-1011 jumbo jet for
Charleston, S.C.
   President Bush last week ordered all off-base U.S. dependents to
move on base for security reasons because of the country's
political crisis.
   Since bases in Panama lack room for the nearly 1,000 off-base
dependents, many are being forced to leave.
   Gen. Fred Woerner, commander of the U.S. Southern Command, came
to say goodbye but refused to comment to reporters.
   Airman 1st Class Dana Horn was one of those who couldn't obtain
base housing and was leaving with her mother, Ju Morrison, and
two-month-old daughter, Alexia.
   She said that her security detachment had become ``like a big
family.''
   Even though she lived in Panama City, Ms. Horn said, she'd never
had trouble with demonstrations, harassment or civil unrest.
   ``I wouldn't leave til they ran me out,'' said Ms. Morrison, who
said the family was from western Kentucky.
   Airman Horn said she and her husband were separated and she
would be going from Charleston, S.C., to Homestead AFB in Florida
for reassignment.
   The Bookwalters were less reluctant to leave.
   ``Panama is very nice, but it's not our family,'' said Joann
Bookwalter, holding a bottle for her young son Randy.
   She and her husband, Airman 1st Class Wayne Bookwalter, were
ordered out suddenly.
   ``It's a big inconvenience, but it's safer to leave,'' she said.

shot to death.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, repeatedly denied shooting
Stethem, claiming his accomplice pulled the trigger. The
accomplice, identified in court records as Hassan Ezzeddine,
remains at large.
   Witnesses said they did not see the actual shooting, which the
crew testified took place behind the cockpit bulkhead, out of the
view of passengers inside the Boeing 727, which was comandeered on
an Athens-to-Rome flight.
   The hijacking lasted 17 days.
   Flight 847 was forced to fly three times to Beirut and twice to
Algiers. Stethem was shot and thrown onto the runway to die when
the plane landed the second time in Beirut in the early morning
hours of June 15, 1985.
   Another Navy diver, Clinton Suggs of Elkhart, Ind., and
passenger Kurt Carlson of Rockford, Ill., were among those most
viciously beaten.

<HEAD>Denver OKs New Airport, Seattle Puts Cap on Downtown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Denver residents voted to boost their city's growth with a new
$2 billion airport, while Seattle residents voted to limit growth
with a lid on the height of new downtown buildings.
   Also Tuesday, voters rejected tax overhauls in Pennsylvania and
Oregon, and Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie Masloff won the Democratic
primary and practically guaranteed herself victory in November.
   In Tucson, Ariz., voters reversed themselves and approved a
school bond package totaling $398 million _ 10 times the amount of
a similar measure that was rejected last year.
   The elections in Denver and Seattle reflected different problems
and priorities in two fast-growing Western cities.
   In Denver, voters sided with Mayor Federico Pena and Gov. Roy
Romer, agreeing that it was time to replace 60-year-old Stapleton
International Airport, the nation's fifth largest, with a new
airport 20 miles from downtown.
   Pena and Romer said Stapleton was overcrowded and obsolete. They
said a new airport was needed to avoid future flight delays and
help Denver remain the economic hub of the Rockies.
   Opponents said the plan was unnecessary and, at $2.3 billion,
too costly.
   The referendum passed by 63-to-37 percent _ 70,122 votes for the
new airport, 41,754 votes against. Denver Election Commission
president Bob Shannon said the 41 percent turnout was
``phenomenal'' for a special election.
   The victory ``gives us direction,'' said Romer. ``It says we
have a future and we're going to claim it.''
   Seattle residents also voted on the future, and agreed that it
doesn't lie 80 stories above Puget Sound. The initiative they
approved restricts the density and height of downtown buildings for
the next 10 years while a long-range development plan is adopted.
   The initiative's most visible impact will be to limit the height
of new buildings to 450 feet, about 38 stories. Seattle now has the
tallest downtown on the West Coast, crowned by the 76-story
Columbia Center.
   With 98 percent of precincts reporting, the vote was 42,007 in
favor of the measure and 25,958 against, or 62-to-38 percent. A
simple majority was needed.
   While most of Tuesday's voting was on growth and money issues,
several cities held mayoral primaries.
   In Pittsburgh, the 71-year-old Mrs. Masloff, who is known for
her folksy touch and describes herself as a ``Jewish grandmother,''
beat four rivals for the Democratic nomination.
   ``Thank you to all of Pittsburgh,'' Mrs. Masloff said. ``I
accept this victory with deep appreciation and humility.''
   Mrs. Masloff was City Council president last year when she was
appointed to fill the vacancy left by the death of Mayor Richard S.
Caliguiri.
   With all but three of the city's 402 precincts reporting, she
had 30,259 votes, or 28 percent, to 25,089 votes, or 23 percent,
for state Rep. Thomas J. Murphy Jr., and 22,727, or 21 percent, for
Allegheny County controller Frank Lucchino. Two other candidates
received the rest.
   In Jackson, Miss., state Rep. Kane Ditto defeated three-term
incumbent Dale Danks Jr. in the Democratic mayoral runoff. Danks
had been considered a slight favorite.
   And in Erie, Pa., City Councilwoman Joyce Savocchio defeated
five opponents to win the Democratic primary in a bid to succeed
six-term Mayor Louis J. Tullio.
   Democrats are heavily favored to win general elections in all
three cities.
   The elections delivered setbacks to Govs. Robert P. Casey of
Pennsylvania and Neil Goldschmidt of Oregon. Both put their
reputations behind proposals to overhaul their states' taxes, and
both lost badly.
   Pennsylvania voters turned back a referendum that would have
allowed counties to impose income taxes in exchange for a promised
reduction in property taxes.
   With 97 percent of the state's precincts reporting, 496,276
people voted for the plan, or 25 percent, and 1,484,973, or 75
percent, voted no.
   Also defeated was a Philadelphia proposal to legalize charity
raffles and other small games of chance.
   Oregonians trounced a ballot measure that would have updated tax
bases for about a third of the state's school districts,
effectively allowing them to raise property taxes without asking
voter approval.
   With votes from 1,682 of the state's 2,261 precincts tallied,
the results were 191,072 votes against the proposal, or 59 percent,
to 130,816 votes, or 41 percent, in favor.

<HEAD>Runaway Train In California May Have Been Overloaded, Investigators
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARBARA METZLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A runaway freight train that
jumped a track and killed four people may have been too heavily
loaded for its locomotives' braking capacity, investigators say.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators focused on
the role the 69-car train's weight may have played in the accident
that damaged or destroyed 11 houses.
   They said a Southern Pacific worker believes the train weighed
nearly 3,000 tons more than the weight recorded for the crew on
documents.
   The train ran off the tracks early Friday at 90 mph at the
bottom of a mountain grade on a curve trains are supposed to take
at 30 mph. Two boys in one of the homes and two crewmen on the
train were killed.
   Shipping documents indicated the train weighed 6,150 tons, a
measurement determined by three railroad clerks, Jim Kolstad, the
safety board's acting chairman, told reporters late Tuesday.
   Southern Pacific's assistant chief dispatcher, Albert Hale,
estimated the train weighed at least 8,950 tons, according to
investigators. Investigators said only three of the train's six
locomotives had adequate braking power.
   The three locomotives would have controlled a 6,150-ton train,
according to a computer simulation run by the NTSB. But the
simulation also showed six locomotives were needed to control a
train of the weight estimated by Hale.
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said the investigation so far
has not determined conclusively what caused the accident. It will
be six to nine months before the final NTSB report is completed.
   Meanwhile, the line reopened Tuesday afternoon with two trains
rolling down Cajon Pass and through the area, said railroad
spokesman Jerry Pera.
   City Attorney James Penman, who had city council authorization
to seek an injunction to keep the track closed, had insisted that
Southern Pacific purchase the properties damaged in the accident.
   Southern Pacific and the city reached agreement hours before
Tuesday's threatened court action designed to shut down the track.
   Penman said the agreement opening the track avoided what could
have been a long court fight. ``We know it is difficult to get an
injunction against a national transportation arm,'' he said.
   Southern Pacific had agreed to buy seven destroyed house for
$70,000 each. On Tuesday afternoon, they agreed to buy four other
houses and accepted the city's demand for an undeveloped land
buffer in case of another derailment.
   ``The area will become a greenbelt area,'' said Mayor Evelyn
Wilcox. ``The rail line is there, and we've done our best to ensure
the health and safety of the residents.''
   The company also agreed to pay the costs of relocating residents
and housing them for 90 days, pick up the city's cleanup costs and
defend San Bernardino in any lawsuit resulting from the wreck.
   Homeowner Fred Revely, whose property was bought by the
railroad, said he was pleased with the agreement. ``I'm very happy
with everything that Southern Pacific has done,'' he said.

   Boston University seniors are getting a final
lesson in supply and demand. Tickets to this weekend's commencement
featuring President Bush and French President Francois Mitterrand
are being scalped for as much as $100.
   About 30,000 people _ 10,000 more than usual _ are expected at
the ceremony, for which each of the 5,600 seniors was allotted four
tickets.
   ``We haven't had to use a system like this in the past because
we've been able to accommodate everyone, but the students' response
this year has been overwhelming,'' BU Executive Vice President Jon
Westling said Tuesday.
   Most students say their parents wouldn't dream of missing
graduation or the chance to watch two world leaders collect
honorary degrees. And for those with small families or eager to
make a buck, the opportunity to wheel and deal is attractive.
   ``It's a very difficult thing to stop, but it's not something we
encourage or condone,'' Westling said of the scalping.
   University President John Silber helped persuade Bush and
Mitterrand to come to the school's urban campus.
   Silber knows Bush from his days at the University of Texas in
the 1960s, university spokesman Thomas Cashman said. He also has
become acquainted with Mitterrand recently through Nobel laureate
Elie Wiesel, a BU professor and friend of the French president,
Cashman said.
   The coup has allowed BU to dominate the keen annual competition
among Massachusetts' 120 colleges for commencement speakers.
Harvard University and Tufts University had to settle for just one
world leader each: Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, respectively.
   Nevertheless, senior Cindy Carron said she regarded the
presidents' visits a mixed blessing because it limits the number of
tickets available and requires extensive security checks.
   ``I'd almost rather have my whole family there to share in the
ceremony instead of the president, who's untouchable,'' she said.

   A councilman urged the city to construct
a UFO landing pad to welcome extraterrestials. His colleagues
quickly brought him down to Earth.
   George Darden has a reputation for filing unusual bills,
including one last year that would have outlawed sex in Metro
Courthouse.
   On Tuesday night, Darden asked his colleagues to show a little
earthly hospitality to visitors from outer space.
   ``Many people have come to me expressing the fact that they are
seeing these unidentified flying objects,'' he told the council's
rules committee.
   The committee unanimously defeated the resolution. The council
later defeated it 27-1, with Darden the only supporter.
   ``You might live to regret this day,'' he told the council,
chiding members for not taking his proposal seriously.
   Councilman Tom Sharp suggested amending the bill to allow the
landing pad be constructed only in Darden's district.
   Councilman Charles French proposed giving UFOs access to the
airport.
   And Mayor Bill Boner said earlier that if the resolution passed,
he would see if aliens would support a contract on a leaseback
basis, although the currency exchange would be a dilemma.
   Darden told reporters later he would build the landing pad
himself.

   A Cuban family's exile has ended with
shouts of joy as they returned to this country five months after
crossing into Canada for what was supposed to be a brief look at
Niagara Falls.
   ``Feliz! Feliz!'' Bermaida Fajardo yelled in Spanish as she ran
from a car to hug a friend.
   Even though the family lived in Miami for several years and
owned a home and business there, U.S. officials blocked their
return from a Christmastime sightseeing trip to Ontario because
they lacked proof of citizenship.
   ``I made a mistake,'' Mrs. Fajardo's husband, Carlos, said
Tuesday after crossing the Peace Bridge into Buffalo. ``We should
not have left the country. I know that now.''
   At the time, Fajardo had an application for political asylum
pending, but it was nullified when the Fajardos and their two
children crossed the border.
   Fajardo, his wife and her two children, Yoradlys and Yoandys,
had traveled north during the Christmas holidays to see snow. They
said they crossed into Canada to get a better view of Niagara Falls.
   Much of the family's stay in Canada was spent trying to get a
new application prepared.
   Their plight attracted the attention of Miami's Hispanic
community and Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., appealed to immigration
officials to allow them to return on humanitarian grounds.
   But Benedict Ferro, district director of the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service in Buffalo, denied the request for
humanitarian parole in March, citing the family's record of
immigration fraud.
   Ferro said Mrs. Fajardo used phony documents to enter the
country illegally in 1985 and that an immigration judge ruled last
summer that she and her two children by another marriage should be
deported.
   But after a new application for asylum and subsequent INS
investigation, Ferro said he could overlook the history of fraud
because Fajardo had a legitimate fear of political persecution if
returned to Cuba.
   ``The system worked the way it is supposed to,'' Ferro said.
``They were denied (parole) on merit, but they were able to meet
the test for asylum. Those are two different standards.''
   Sister Kathleen Rimar, who acted as the Fajardo's attorney,
criticized immigration officials.
   ``They could have been allowed to return much sooner but I think
they felt they had to make an example of them,'' she said.
   She said that during the exile in Canada the Fajardos lost their
home and business in Miami.
   Despite the losses, Fajardo said he felt no animosity toward
immigration officials.
   ``I don't think about that. I'm only interested in the future,''
Fajardo said. ``I feel like I have been born again.''
   The family plans to spend a few days in Buffalo and then return
to the Miami area where friends and relatives will help them
re-establish a boat building business.
   Immigration officials said the family would be able to apply for
citizenship next year.

   The Walt Disney Co. won a $150,000 award from a

   In his ruling Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Terence T. Evans also
prohibited Concert Shirt Inc. of Milwaukee and its owner, Jack
Kupper, from manufacturing or marketing merchandise with characters
or objects from the movie.
   Kupper was found to have infringed on the copyright by using
pictures of Roger Rabbit, Jessica and Benny the Cab.
   Disney and Amblin Entertainment, a California corporation,
brought the suit against Kupper.
   Kupper's attorney, Charles N. Quinn, said his client no longer

<TEXT>
   Christians and Moslems staged a
nationwide one-day strike today in a unique show of unity to mourn
the spiritual leader of the country's Sunni Moslems, who was
assassinated in a car bombing.
   ``Lebanon today mourns its knight, the martyr of national unity,
Sheik Hassan Khaled,'' said the Voice of Lebanon radio, mouthpiece
of the right-wing Christian Phalange Party.
   The Grand Mufti, as he was known, was killed along with 21 other
people in Tuesday when the bomb exploded in a densely populated
residential district of Syrian-policed west Beirut as his car drove
past.
   Seventy-five people were wounded and two buildings devastated
   Banks, government offices, shops, restaurants, movie theaters
and other businesses closed today in all areas, including Israel's
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in the south, police said. No
trouble was reported.
   ``This is the first total shutdown in Lebanon since the civil
war broke out in 1975,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot be
named under standing regulations.
   Khaled, 68, was the most senior Sunni cleric in Lebanon, a post
he held for 23 years. His assassination silenced the Moslems' most
prominent advocate of moderation. He had guided his 900,000
followers into seeking peaceful coexistence with Lebanon's
Christians to end the 14-year-old civil war.
   As is usual with car bombings, there has been no claim of
responsibility for Tuesday's carnage.
   Syria and its leftist militia allies, in separate statements,
blamed Khaled's assassination on army commander Gen. Michel Aoun,
whose mainly Christian troops have been locked in fierce artillery
and rocket battles with the Syrian forces and their Moslem and
Druse allies since March 8.
   Aoun, who also heads a Christian government vying for power with
a rival Moslem Cabinet, pointed the finger at the Syrians, who he
has branded an occupying force in Lebanon, although he did not name
them.
   He described Khaled as ``a great, bold leader'' and expressed
the hope that his slaying would guide the Lebanese to ``take a
unified stand against the occupiers of our land.''
   Aoun and the Lebanese Front alliance of right-wing Christian
political groups ordered a total shutdown today throughout the
310-square-mile Christian enclave to mourn the Grand Mufti.
   Christian, Moslem and leftist radio stations broadcast somber
music to mourn Khaled, who is survived by a wife, six sons and
three daughters.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni who heads the
predominantly Moslem Cabinet, has pledged to follow Khaled's
moderate path.
   ``We shall never deviate from the course of moderation our
martyred Grand Mufti has charted,'' Hoss said in a statement
Tuesday.
   Lebanon has more Shiite Moslems than Sunnis. Shiites loyal to
Iran are believed to hold most of the 15 foreigners missing in
Lebanon, who include nine Americans, but Sunnis are not believed to
be involved in hostage-taking.
   Seventy-five Moslems wounded in recent fighting left west Beirut
today in a convoy of ambulances for Damascus, Syria's capital, to
board a plane for Kuwait. They are to be treated in hospitals there
under a humanitarian program launched by the oil-rich gulf state to
aid Moslem and Christian victims of Lebanon's violence.
   Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, heads
a six-member Arab League committee seeking to mediate an end to the
bloodshed.
   A Christian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
preparations were under way to ``guarantee safe exit'' for an
unspecified number of wounded Christians to leave for Kuwait.
   Police said Syrian and Druse gunners fired two dozen rockets and
howitzer shells at the Christian coastline early today, violating a
week-old cease-fire brokered by the Arab League.
   Syria and its allies have declared they will keep shelling the
Christian coastline, despite the truce, to prevent Aoun receiving
supplies by sea.
   Aoun's gunners did not respond to the violations, which have
blocked the deployment of a 321-man force of military observers
from Kuwait and five other Arab nations to monitor the cease-fire.

<TEXT>
   Workers at Elsinore's Atlantis Casino
Hotel expressed frustration and fear over news that the debt-ridden
gaming hall has become the first to be ordered closed by New Jersey
regulators.
   Philip T. Forsyth, a floor supervisor, said he has found only
part-time work as a dealer or cashier.
   ``They hire part-time to save on benefits,'' he said. ``I have a
$1,140 mortgage _ how can I work part-time?''
   Other employees have been luckier than Forsyth. Myrtile Mays, a
dealer, has a job lined up with another casino.
   ``I went out looking for another job a couple of weeks ago _
just in case,'' Mays said.
   Mays said the mood among Atlantis employees on Tuesday was
``hyper, really stressful. A lot of people don't know how they're
going to pay their bills, especially their mortgages.''
   Forsyth said many employees are embittered toward company
President Jeanne Hood, blaming her for mismanagement.
   ``She was brazen enough to walk through the casino a few days
ago,'' he said. ``She was smiling and waving even though people
were calling her names.''
   Forsyth also said many employees are angered with developer
Donald Trump's $63 million purchase agreement to buy the
three-tiered Atlantis and convert it into a hotel without a casino.
   The state Casino Control Commission on Tuesday ordered the
casino to close next Monday, citing its estimated $144 million
debt. The hotel, which runs at about 80 percent occupancy on
weekends, was allowed to remain open.
   Atlantic City, which approved gambling in 1976, has 11 other
casinos.
   The Atlantis has suffered heavy losses after opening in 1981 as
the Playboy Hotel and Casino. It emerged last fall from federal
bankruptcy reorganization.
   Some employees cried when they heard news of the closing.
   ``We're all very down. The Atlantis people were a very together
people, just trying to keep the place together,'' said Michael
Bucci, a casino host.
   Some maintained optimism.
   ``A lot of these people have gone through the rough years when
the casino was still Playboy, the bankruptcy and two strikes,''
said Roy Silbert, president of Local 54 of the Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Employees International Union.
   ``They're cautiously optimistic. You never can predict whether
or not this news will force something to happen to the business.''
   In recent weeks, Atlantis' 2,100 employees have anxiously
watched as the state denied Elsinore officials a license and
appointed a conservator to control the gaming hall.
   Even if the 1,100 casino floor employees find work at other
gaming halls, many will lose up to eight years of seniority and
accompanying benefits. Others, particularly those in supervisory
positions, will be unable to find similar positions.
   Silbert said Tuesday that he planned to appeal the commission's
decision in U.S. District Court in Camden.
   ``I'm not trying to stop the closing,'' he said. ``We just want
to protect the federal mandate for adequate notice.''
   Silbert said a recently enacted federal plant closing act
requires an employer to notify workers 60 days in advance of any
closing.
   Some Atlantis customers reacted to the news with a shrug.
   ``We'll just go to another casino,'' said one customer, Sam
Giterman of Philadelphia.

<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index edged up
today, and the dollar gained against the yen for a fifth day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
33,992.45, up 66.00 points, or 0.19 percent. The index had gained
210.16 points Tuesday.
   The dollar finished at 137.70 yen, up 0.70 yen from Tuesday's
137.00-yen close. After opening at 137.12 yen, it rose despite the
central bank's dollar-selling intervention, and ranged between
136.97 yen and 137.75 yen.
   The dollar has gained 3.26 yen in five straight trading days.
   The dollar-yen rate moved little in early trading, as traders
waited for the announcement later today of U.S. trade figures for
March. But then traders began buying dollars following developments
in Japan's influence-peddling scandal, traders said.
   Tokyo prosecutors summoned Takao Fujinami, a top aide to former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, and Katsuya Ikeda, a lawmaker
from the Clean Government Party, for questioning in connection with
alleged attempts by Recruit Co. to buy influence.
   For the third consecutive day, the Bank of Japan intervened in
an attempt to support the yen, said Masafumi Koyama of the Bank of
Tokyo.
   The central bank reportedly sold $100 million to $200 million.
The bank does not comment on its activities in the exchange market.
   Other traders said the central bank intervention, which failed
to push the dollar lower, was only to discourage the current
dollar-buying mood.
   Kyodo News Service quoted unidentified Bank of Japan officials
as saying the dollar's recent strength comes despite a lack of any
changes in economic fundamentals, and that the dollar-buying was
``overdone'' and ``speculative.''
   Japan ``will continue to take determined measures in
cooperation'' with other major monetary nations, Kyodo quoted the
officials as saying.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei figure moved very little
today, ``mainly due to political uncertainties,'' said Kenji
Ishizuka, a dealer with Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
   He said the new developments in the Recruit scandal discouraged
participants to some extent.
   ``Japanese investors were also concerned about the possible
interest rate hike by the West German federal bank, meeting
tomorrow,'' said Ishizuka.
   ``Market players bought only cheaper issues because they were
reluctant to make major moves. Still, it shows that investors have
so much money, since prices rose even when they didn't have
specific incentives to buy,'' he said.
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 800
million shares, up from Tuesday's 600 million. Among gainers were
ship building and chemical issues.

   A man accused of killing his
ex-girlfriend and five other people, including two children, spent
the first day of his trial in a holding cell after he was ejected
from the courtroom.
   David ``Moochie'' Welch was ordered out of the courtroom Tuesday
after he repeatedly interrupted the trial. He watched the
proceedings on a closed-circuit television from the cell.
   Welch, 31, is charged with six counts of first-degree murder and
two counts of attempted murder in the slayings at the home of his
17-year-old ex-girlfriend, Dellane Mabre. Also slain were her
3-year-old daughter, her two brothers, and a family friend and her
2-year-old daughter.
   Welch's and Mabrey's son, Dexter, then 3 months old, and a
21-year-old man were wounded.
   Each victim was shot in the head with a 9mm Uzi submachine or a
.357-caliber Magnum after Welch allegedly kicked in the door of the
home in the early morning hours of Dec. 8, 1986.
   Welch and Rita Lewis, 32, were arrested after a five-hour
standoff with police. Lewis pleaded guilty to six counts of murder
and was sentenced to 51 years to life in prison. Prosecutors
dropped their request for the death penalty in exchange for her
plea.
   Although not expected to testify in Welch's trial, Lewis
testified in her own case that Welch was angry about a bitter
breakup with Mabrey and had been smoking rock cocaine the day
before the slayings.
   At the time of the killings, Welch was awaiting trial for
allegedly assaulting Mabrey and her mother. He also was facing
heroin and cocaine possession charges.
   Since his arrest, Welch has filed numerous legal motions and
requests. He also has fired three attorneys, had judges removed
from his case and sought to have Lewis' public defender disbarred.
Welch also has asked for a personal barber, a private secretary and
private transportation to and from court. Those requests were
denied.
   Court records show Welch has been convicted of assaulting a
police officer, receiving stolen property and assault with a deadly
weapon. He was released from prison in January 1986.
   On Tuesday, Welch interrupted the proceedings, objecting that he
was not able to view a videotape of the crime scene being shown to
jurors.
   ``If you continue to talk, you'll be removed. Don't push me
beyond the limit,'' Alameda County Superior Court Judge Stanley
Golde told Welch, pointing out that the defendant had seen the tape
before.
   He was taken to a holding cell after his fourth interruption.

<HEAD>Report: 4,000 Chinese Died in Vietnam War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 4,000 Chinese servicemen died in the
Vietnam War after China sent about 320,000 of its forces to fight
the United States, according to a news report.
   The report from the semi-official Hong Kong China News Agency
attributed its information to The History of the People's Republic
of China, a new reference book published by China's official State
Archives Publishing House.
   The report, seen in Hong Kong today, was believed to be the
first Chinese disclosure of a more precise figure on casualties,
which the Chinese have said in the past was in the ``thousands.''
   The United States claimed repeatedly during the Vietnam War that
there was evidence Chinese forces were involved in the war. China
denied the allegations.
   China has acknowledged that its assistance to Vietnam during the
war, which ended in a Communist victory in 1975, included sending
about 320,000 personnel and $20 billion in aid.
   But in 1979, when relations between China and Vietnam
deteriorated, China's official People's Daily newspaper and Xinhua
News Agency published a booklet on China's assistance to Vietnam.
   ``From January 1965 to March 1968, China dispatched to Vietnam
support forces of over 320,000 men to undertake air defense,
engineering, railway and logistics work,'' the booklet said.
   ``Together with the Vietnamese people, the Chinese support
forces defended the territorial air space of North Vietnam with
their lives.''
   It added: ``The remains of thousands of Chinese martyrs lie on
Vietnamese soil to this day.''
   China and the Soviet Union were Vietnam's principal supporters
during the war. But relations between China and Vietnam later
deteriorated over Vietnam's persecution of ethnic Chinese,
territorial conflicts, Vietnam's close alliance with the Soviet
Union and Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1978.

   A woman whose home has been hit by
repeated break-ins has put up a sign telling would-be robbers not
to bother.
   ``Notice to thieves: 8 robberies _ nothing left,'' says the sign
on Helen Ferris' front door.
   ``If they can read, they'll know they will be wasting their
time,'' said Ferris, who has lived at the three-room house for 15
years and posted the sign Monday. ``There's nothing in there they
can pawn.''
   Ferris said the break-ins have taken place since the early 1980s.
   ``That doesn't include the times things were stolen from outside
the house,'' she said. ``I put a Christmas wreath on my front door
five years ago and one hour later it was gone.''
   Ferris is among a growing number of burglary victims in Fort
Lauderdale. In 1988, 4,251 burglaries were reported, up from 3,958
in 1987.
   ``It's gone up primarily because of the crack cocaine problem,''
said police spokesman Ott Cefkin. ``Nobody is frustrated more than
we are. We just don't have enough police around.''

<HEAD>Prosecutors Summon Two Lawmakers for Questioning in Recruit Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors today questioned elected officials for
the first time who are suspects in the influence-peddling scandal
that has caused a rash of resignations and damaged public
confidence in Japanese politics.
   The list of disgraced party leaders also grew as the chairman of
the opposition Komeito, or Clean Government Party, said he would
resign.
   Junya Yano is the third party head to announce his resignation
because of the scandal, following Prime Minister Norobu Takeshita
as president of the governing Liberal Democrats and Saburo
Tsukamoto of the Democratic Socialists.
   Takeshita remains in office while the Liberal Democrats search
for a leader and a prime minister who is respected and untainted by
the scandal, which has decimated the top ranks of politicians in
Japan.
   Takako Doi, head of the opposition Japan Socialist Party, said
the disruption in Komeito was disappointing at a time she is trying
to hold together an opposition coalition to oust the Liberal
Democrats.
   ``I hope Komeito will go ahead and unite with the Socialists,
overcoming the latest trials,'' Ms. Doi said.
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, summoned two Parliament members for
questioning. They said the lawmakers were suspected of accepting
bribes in return for helping the Recruit Co. in its business of
employment information.
   Prosecutors say the conglomerate sought favors by selling
cut-price stock in a subsidiary to about 160 politicians,
bureaucrats and business and media executives.
   The buyers earned handsome profits after the shares went on sale
to the public in 1986 and the price shot up.
   Prosecutors have charged 14 people with violations of bribery
and securities laws, but until today all the official suspects in
the scandal were businessmen or civil servants.
   Liberal Democrat Takao Fujinami, 56, who served as chief Cabinet
secretary for three years under former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone, was ordered to one prosecutor's office, and Komeito
legislator Katsuya Ikeda, 51, was called to another.
   By Japanese legal custom, the summoning was equivalent to
arrest, but since Parliament is in session the prosecutors could
not jail the two lawmakers without permission of the Parliament.
   Fujinami plans to resign his seat in the House of
Representatives, Kyodo news service reported. He is suspected of
helping Recruit in employment advertising and giving other favors
in exchange for a profit of about $190,000 in a share transaction
handled by his secretary.
   Ikeda announced Tuesday that he would resign his Parliament seat
to atone for ``causing troubles'' to his Buddhist-affiliated party,
which is almost as deeply troubled by the Recruit scandal as the
Liberal Democrats.
   Ikeda had no power as an opposition legislator but prosecutors
say he repeatedly brought issues before Parliament to benefit
Recruit.
   Ikeda's brother, Yuzuru, earned about $73,500 on Recruit share
transactions, and reports say 70 percent of the profit went into
Ikeda's own bank account.
   Fujinami and Ikeda also received large donations from Recruit.
   Komeito leaders met after the lawmakers were summoned and
Chairman Yano later told reporters that he believed Ikeda's
statement that he was innocent of wrongdoing.
   But the Komeito chairman said public trust in the party had been
impaired.
   ``I apologize from my heart and, taking this situation seriously
and realizing my own resposibility, I resign the chairmanship,''
Yano said.

   Voters approved a plan to replace the nation's
fifth largest airport, prompting a jubilant Mayor Federico Pena to
predict that construction would begin on a new $2 billion airport
later this year.
   ``This is a victory for every young person who wants to stay in
Colorado,'' Pena said Tuesday night after the airport referendum
passed. ``Denver just took off!''
   Pena and Colorado Gov. Roy Romer had campaigned hard to build a
replacement for 60-year-old Stapleton International Airport, which
detractors say is too old and small to serve a growing regional hub.
   Although the vote was non-binding, city officials had agreed to
abide by its results. Two leading opponents of the new airport
announced after the election that they would honor the vote and not
try to stop construction.
   The referendum passed 62.7 percent to 37.3 percent, with 70,122
votes to build the airport and 41,754 against. Election Commission
President Bob Shannon called the 41 percent turnout ``phenomenal''
for a special election.
   It if is built, the new facility would be the first major
airport built in the United States since Dallas-Fort Worth
International opened in 1974.
   But first, Denver will have to come up with the money.
   The city estimates that it needs $500 million in federal funds
and $1.5 billion in revenue bonds. Pena said he would go to
Washington, D.C., to deliver the city's letter of intent for
federal funds to the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``This is a national economic development decision that will be
helpful to the entire country,'' Pena said. ``We have to have a
national transportation system that works. That is the main
argument I am making to Congress.''
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner had predicted that
Denver voters would approve the new airport, calling the plan ``the
most creative aviation development project in many years.''
   Airlines maintained a low profile during the airport campaign,
but Continental Airlines spokesman Ned Walker said Tuesday night
that airport supporters had sidestepped the financing issue.
   ``Unfortunately, the referendum may actually have set the new
airport back because it excludes the use of city taxes as a
component of the project financing plan,'' Walker said. ``It did
nothing to solve the main problem, and that is _ where will Denver
find the $2.3 billion it now says the new airport will cost?''
   Denver International Airport, scheduled for operation in 1994,
would be built about 17 miles northeast of downtown Denver on 53
square miles of land annexed last year from Adams County.
   Plans for the new airport call for 94 boarding gates on two
concourses, with expansion later to 120 gates. Stapleton has 94.
   A final environmental impact statement of the proposed airport
site is expected in July or August, and then construction can
begin. Pena said he expected groundbreaking to take place later
this year.
   The Let's Vote Yes campaign had argued that Stapleton needed to
be replaced to head off lengthy flight delays in the future. They
also said a new airport would stimulate the city's economy.
   Opponents, including the Let's Vote No and Save Our Airport
campaigns, said a decrease in air traffic at Stapleton during the
last two years was an indication that a new airport was unneeded.
They also said the new airport would be too costly and wouldn't
improve the economy.

   The man who arranged the murder of a rookie
policeman in a drug-related slaying that drew President Bush's
attention was sentenced to the maximum prison term: 25 years to
life.
   The sentencing of Philip Copeland on Tuesday prompted long,
thunderous applause from about 150 policemen who packed the
courtroom.
   ``You are unfit to be a member of our society,'' Judge Thomas A.
Demakos told the 23-year-old Copeland. ``This arrogant act assaults
our society.''
   Copeland also got a five-to-15 years in prison for weapons
possession, with the sentence to run concurrently. Demakos said he
wished the law allowed him to make the terms consecutive.
   The judge said he would recommend no parole. He said that when
he retires, his last act would be to remind the parole board of his
recommendation.
   Copeland was convicted for the February 1988 slaying of Officer
Edward Byrne, who was shot five times as he sat alone in a parked
patrol car.
   The 22-year-old officer was guarding a house that had been
firebombed after its owner complained about drug dealers in the
Queens neighborhood. The man has since been relocated in a
witness-protection program.
   Assistant District Attorney Eugene Kelly called Copeland the
mastermind of the plot.
   ``This is a crime of monstrous proportions. ... This was a
message to society,'' Kelly said of the sentence.
   Byrne's mother, Ann, wept as she heard the sentence. Her
husband, Matthew, a former police lieutenant, was stoic.
   Copeland also showed no emotion.
   When his lawyer, Frank Hancock, told the judge Copeland feared
for his safety in prison, the officers in the courtroom again
applauded.
   Hancock said later he had gotten a letter from Copeland's
cousin, also a prisoner, saying prison guards intended to provoke
Copeland, restrain and beat him.
   Asked how Copeland felt about the letter, Hancock replied,
``It's not his major concern. His major concern is that they not
cut his hair'' because of his Rastafarian beliefs.
   About 10,000 uniformed police officers from around the country
attended Byrne's funeral.
   Police, who saw the killing as a defiant message from the drug
world, established Tactical Narcotics Teams of undercover officers
to sweep dealers off the streets in drug-plagued neighborhoods.
   Byrne's father presented then-GOP nominee Bush with his son's
police shield during the presidential election campaign. Bush
showed the shield to audiences around the country when he spoke
about the need to crack down on illegal drugs.
   Copeland was one of three people convicted of second-degree
murder and a weapons charges after a two-month trial.
   The judge postponed until June 6 the sentencings of Todd Scott,
20, and Scott Cobb, 25.
   The trial of 21-year-old David McClary, identified by Scott and
Cobb as the triggerman, was postponed a day until Thursday after
his lawyer filed an appeal that it be moved.

   A village that went a century
without a homicide is reeling from the fourth slaying of a woman in
less than two years, all apparently the result of domestic
disputes, police said.
   Police acting on a tip found the body of Tracy Sheperd, 27,
early Tuesday in the woods, District Attorney Judd Carhart said.
   He said she was killed about a week ago, apparently after a
fight with her boyfriend.
   Carhart declined to say how the woman was killed pending an
autopsy.
   David MacDonald, a 30-year-old bartender, was arrested in the
couple's apartment, Police Chief Michael Saharceski said. He
pleaded innocent to a murder charge and was ordered to undergo
psychiatric tests.
   The chief said the only links among the four killings were that
the couples were all young and unmarried. Before the recent quartet
of slayings, the last prior homicide in the village of 5,700 was in
the 1880s, when two paper mill workers fought in a bar, Saharceski
said.
   ``They are just cases of domestic violence, and who knows why
they happen?'' he said. ``We could have a police officer on every
corner in town and we still couldn't stop what happened.''
   Last week, before the fourth slaying was discovered, several
hundred people marched in Greenfield to protest domestic violence.
The march was one of several community events held to increase
public awareness about violence.
   ``It is deeply ironic, if that's even the right word, to find
out after a whole week of education on violence that here we have
another murder to deal with,'' said Debra McLaughlin, a rally
organizer. ``It's hard not to feel overwhelmed.''
   ``It's insanity,'' said Mary Osborn, who lives just across the
Connecticut River in Greenfield.
   Ms. Osborn, a part-time student and volunteer at a women's
shelter in Northampton, blamed the violence in part on hard times
in the town of 6,000 people.
   ``It's working class, depressed, the factories are all gone, the
people have been stripped of dignity in a lot of ways,'' she said.
   The first woman to die was Vivian Morrisey, 31, strangled in
September 1987 in her home. Her former boyfriend was convicted of
murder and sentenced to life in prison.
   Nearly a year later, Virginia Ferrer, 27, onetime resident of a
shelter for battered women, was stabbed to death behind her home.
Police arrested a man identified as the father of four of her
children. He is awaiting trial.
   Catherine Gochinski, 16, was found shot to death Feb. 3 in the
apartment she shared with her 18-year-old boyfriend and his sister.
He also is awaiting trial.

   The first wave of American military
personnel and dependents who have been advised to leave Panama
arrived back in the United States looking tired but happy.
   A chartered jet with 276 people aboard touched down at
Charleston International Airport late Tuesday in what the Defense
Department said was a ``hastened withdrawal'' from the Central
American country.
   A second jet carrying military dependents was scheduled to
arrive here late tonight.
   The Pentagon on Tuesday announced it would step up efforts to
protect relatives of military personnel and requested that those
dependents either move onto bases in Panama or leave the country.
   Lt. Col. Bob Skinner, an Army spokesman at Ft. McPherson, Ga.,
said that when possible, the tours of military personnel with
families in Panama would be curtailed.
   However, he said, most would remain in Panama until replacements
are found.
   ``We're calling this a hastened withdrawal,'' Skinner said. ``An
evacuation is mandatory. This is not mandatory. It is not an
emergency. It is voluntary.''
   Skinner said the withdrawal was ``primarily because of concerns
regarding the current uncertain situation in Panama _ a concern
that's been accentuated by the recent harassment of U.S. personnel
in the violent aftermath of the Panamanian presidential elections.''
   He said there are an estimated 3,300 military personnel and
dependents being urged to move. There are about 14,000 military
dependents in Panama.
   Among those arriving Tuesday were Army Sgt. Raymond Johnson, his
wife, daughter and son.
   ``Being a family man, I felt it would be safer to have my family
here,'' said Johnson, of El Paso, Texas.
   Johnson said members of the Panamanian Defense Force often
harassed Americans, stopping them on the streets and sometimes
asking for money.
   Army Staff Sgt. Donald Bell of Dallas, who returned following
three years in Panama, said such harassment ``gets common after a
while. It's not physical harassment. It's small stuff.''
   Gloria Keener, whose husband's Air Force tour in Panama ends
next month, said she was notified about three days ago of the
flight to Charleston.
   ``Everything was O.K.,'' she said. ``But people are getting
scared because they don't know what's going on.''

<HEAD>Five-Time Oscar Winner John Green Dies at 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Green, who pursued a music
career despite advice from his father and won five Oscars for movie
scores including ``An American in Paris'' and ``Easter Parade,''
has died. He was 80.
   Green died at home Monday night of pulmonary edema, said his
spokesman Frank Liberman. Green had suffered a stroke two years ago.
   ``He was the best of his kind,'' said frequent collaborator Gene
Kelly. ``There are none like him around any more. ... He was the
granddad of the musical score on every movie.''
   Green, an accomplished pianist, began playing at age 3. Nine
years later, he became a protege of George Gershwin.
   Green received 14 Academy Award nominations in a career spanning
decades. His Oscar victories came for scoring ``Easter Parade,''
``An American in Paris,'' ``West Side Story'' and ``Oliver!'' and
for producing the one-reel short subject ``The Merry Wives of
Windsor Overture.''
   Additional awards included the recording industry's Grammy, the
film industry's Golden Globe, and an Aggie, the highest award of
the Songwriters Guild.
   In 1983, the American Society of Music Arrangers named Green the
first recipient of its President's Award for distinguished service
to music, musicians and the entertainment industry.
   He had remained active until a few days before his death. On
Sunday, he produced the annual gala for the John Douglas French
Foundation for Alzheimer's disease, of which he was a founder.
   In March 1987, Green appeared with Leonard Bernstein, Liza
Minnelli, Bobby Short and Mikhail Baryshnikov in a gala Public
Broadcasting System tribute to Gershwin.
   A member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Green's best known
compositions included ``Coquette,'' ``Out of Nowhere,'' ``I Cover
the Waterfront,'' ``I Wanna be Loved,'' ``The Song of Raintree
County'' and ``Body and Soul.''
   Green, who served as the general music director for MGM Studios
from 1949 to 1958, either produced or conducted nine Oscar
presentations, including the first shown on television in 1953. For
that pioneering telecast, Green was named a lifetime member of the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
   He also worked as a producer of television films for Desilu
Productions, the company founded by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.
   Born Oct. 10, 1908 in New York, Green graduated at age 19 from
Harvard University with an economics degree.
   Although his song ``Coquette'' was already a sheet-music hit, he
followed his father's advise and briefly took a job on Wall Street.
   His father had told him: ``Son, ... you can be a good banker, a
good lawyer or doctor and you'll be a proud, respected citizen in
the community. But there is no bum in the world like an artist who
is merely good, and I'm afraid as a musician you are merely good.''
   ``I was a sissy to do it,'' he once said of following his
father's advice.
   But after six months on Wall Street he went to work for
Paramount as a rehearsal pianist.
   Green is survived by his wife of 45 years, Bonnie, a former
showgirl at MGM, three daughters and four grandchildren.
   A memorial service will be held Monday at the Bel-Air
Presbyterian Church.

<TEXT>
   Playwright Vaclav Havel,
Czechoslovakia's most well-known opposition activist, was freed on
probation today after serving half of an eight-month jail sentence
on protest-related charges.
   Havel was arrested in January during a week of anti-government
protests.
   His imprisonment, widely condemned in the West as well as by
intellectuals in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union, marked the
start of a new crackdown on dissent by Czechoslovak authorities.
   Czechoslovakia's Communist leaders have resisted the political
reforms that are sweeping through much of the rest of the Soviet
bloc.
   Judge Eva Kvetenska ruled after a 12-minute hearing that Havel
could be freed on good behavior but would be on probation for 18
months. If he violates the law in that time he would be jailed
again for four months.
   Czechoslovak supporters admitted to the small courtroom
adjoining the Pankrac prison where Havel was held applauded as he
embraced his wife, Olga, after the ruling.
   ``I certainly think all the actions of solidarity helped a
lot,'' Havel said after he was released about an hour later. ``I am
glad I was released, but the whole sentence was nonsense. I should
not have been in jail at all.''
   Havel, a co-founder of the Charter 77 human rights movement, may
have been released early to head off criticism at an international
human rights conference opening in Paris on May 30, opposition
activists said.
   Czechoslovakia is one of the 35 nations that signed the 1975
Helsinki Final Act that will attend the meeting.
   ``I am optimistic for one reason, that they would prefer to look
nice in Paris rather than ugly,'' said Havel's brother Ivan. ``But
all that is guesswork. We know that our authorities are not at all
concerned with their public image.''
   At least 20 opposition activists have been jailed, fined or
given suspended sentences since the January protests.
   Havel, 52, was sentenced on Feb. 22 to nine months in jail on
charges of incitement and obstructing a police officer at a
demonstration in Prague on Jan. 16.
   An appeals court threw out the obstruction charge in February
and reduced the sentence to eight months. Havel then was moved to
another jail where conditions were better and he was entitled to
ask for parole midway through his sentence.
   Havel was charged with incitement after he used Western radio
stations to appeal to the anonymous authors of a letter who wrote
him threatening to commit suicide to protest the lack of democracy
in Czechoslovakia.
   He urged the writers not to emulate Jan Palach, a Czech student
who died after setting himself ablaze in January 1969 to protest
the previous summer's Soviet-led invasion that crushed Prague
Spring reforms.
   About 3,300 people had signed a petition supporting Havel's
request for parole, Ivan Havel said.
   When the playwright was sentenced to 4{ years in jail on charges
of sedition in 1979, no one in Czechoslovakia spoke up on behalf of
Havel and fellow Charter 77 activists jailed with him.
   After Havel's trial in February, Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski of
Poland attended the Warsaw premiere of two Havel plays, which are
banned in Czechoslovakia.

   A helicopter filming a Chuck Norris
movie crashed, killing four people, after its tail struck a wall, a
witness said. An aviation official reported strong winds in the
area at the time.
   The other four people aboard were seriously injured in Tuesday's
crash.
   The dead included two Americans, gaffer Don Marshall and key
grip Mike Graham, Gadi Danzig, an Israeli cameraman, and the
Filipino pilot, officials said. No hometowns were available.
   Norris was not on the set of ``Stranglehold: Delta Force II''
when the crash occurred, although he was in the Philippines, Cannon
Entertainment spokesman Randy Maiers said from Los Angeles.
   American character actor John P. Ryan, a Delta Force commander
in the film, suffered a dislocated shoulder in the crash. He and
three others were transferred today to the U.S.-run Clark Air Base,
50 miles north of Manila.
   Police investigator Jaime Talay said the French-made Dauphin
helicopter had just taken off to film a scene when it veered
sharply to the left, crashed in a 40-foot ravine and exploded.
   Talay said the scene called for the single-rotor, 14-passenger
helicopter to make a tricky manuever by tilting sharply and diving
and it took several moments before the stunned crew on the ground
realized the crash was real.
   The crash occurred about 5 p.m. near an unfinished mansion once
owned by former President Ferdinand Marcos in a mountain resort 30
miles south of Manila.
   Romeo Ferma, a firetruck operator who witnessed the crash and
put out the fire, told reporters the helicopter took off from a
hillside helipad, circled the mansion once and then clipped a wall
with its tail.
   ``Afterward, it nose-dived and caught fire,'' Ferma said.
   In California, Cannon Entertainment, the film's maker, said the
scene was not considered hazardous.
   But Galileo Baliqued, chief of the aviation safety section of
the Bureau of Air Transport, said there were strong winds in the
area Tuesday that were ``not very nice for helicopter flying.''
Tropical storm Brenda was approaching.
   Oscar Alejandro, acting director of the Board of Air
Transportation, said investigators reached the site early today and
were interviewing witnesses.
   He said the investigation was being hampered because the pilot
was dead and all the survivors were hospitalized with serious
injuries.
   Filipino reporters said soldiers and members of the crew tried
to confiscate film at the hospital where survivors were taken late
Tuesday.
   ``Even I was not allowed to enter (the crash site) until I told
them who I was,'' Alejandro said. ``They (film crew) are not very
talkative.''
   Besides Ryan, Cannon said the others injured were Geoff Brewer,
an actor-stuntman from Los Angeles; Rami Siman-Tov, an Israeli crew
member and actor Mateo Gomez, a native of the Dominican Republic
who lives in the United States.
   Officials said the aircraft was owned by Traders Royal Bank, a
Filipino bank.
   The crew of ``Stranglehold'' had been in the Philippines for two
months and was due to finish filming on May 27. The movie depicts
the destruction of a Latin American drug syndicate.
   It was the second accident involving a Norris film in the
Philippines.
   In 1987, a Philippine military Sikorsky helicopter used by
Norris' crew crashed in Manila Bay, killing three Filipino soldiers
working as extras.
   The 1987 crash took place while Norris was filming ``Missing In
Action, Part III _ Braddock.''

<HEAD>Storms Lash Texas, Plains with Tornadoes, Hail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms continued to hover over Texas this
morning after a day of severe storms that spawned several tornadoes
and produced torrential rains and hail up to 4{ inches in diameter.
   Storms also continued in parts of the central and southern
Plains and lower Mississippi Valley.
   Storm clouds dropped seven tornadoes Tuesday afternoon and
plastered the town of Shamrock with 4{-inch hail.
   During the evening, tornadoes touched down in north-central
Texas at Joshua and at Cleburne, and in southern Hood County. Golf
ball-size hail struck several northern and western towns including
Amarillo and Midland, and smaller hail fell elsewhere.
   Winds gusted to 60 mph at Van Horn and destroyed a house in
Kinney County.
   Some areas of eastern Texas reported 5 to 7 inches Tuesday,
closing several roads and bridges, while more than four inches of
rain caused flash floods in some north-central areas.
   Severe storms also stretched from the Plains to the Gulf Coast
Tuesday evening. A thunderstorm touched down near Westcliffe,
Colo., and one-inch hail fell at Mooreland and Cedar Springs,
Okla., and at Baton Rouge, La.
   Strong thunderstorms were clustered over central and northwest
Texas early today.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms also extended across northern
Texas and southern Oklahoma into southwest Arkansas and northwest
Louisiana, and from northwest Oklahoma across western Kansas into
eastern Colorado.
   In the 6 hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT, 2.38 inches fell near
Amarillo, nearly 2 inches fell at Dallas and nearly 1{ inches were
recorded at Baton Rouge.
   Rain continued to fall along the East Coast, with showers
extending this morning from eastern Virginia to southern New
England. Dry weather prevailed elsewhere.
   Today's forecast called for severe storms across the southern
Plains and the lower Mississippi Valley, with numerous severe
thunderstorms and possible tornadoes expected over much of central
and eastern Texas and western Louisiana. Showers and thunderstorms
also were forecast for much of the rest of the Great Plains and
Mississippi Valley. Showers were expected to extend along the
central and southern New England coast, across New Jersey and
southeastern Pennsylvania, and along the northern Pacific Coast.
   Highs were expected to be in the 50s and 60s from central Maine
across southern New England, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania and
southeastern New York state, as well as from northern Oregon across
Washington state, and scattered along the California coast; the 60s
from much of Nebraska across western Kansas, southeast Wyoming,
Colorado, New Mexico and northeast Arizona; near 80 degrees over
northeast New York state and west-central New England; the 80s and
low 90s from South Carolina across Florida, from much of Kentucky
across the central Gulf Coast, much of Louisiana and southern and
central Texas, and from eastern California and much of Nevada
across western Arizona. Highs elsewhere were expected to be in the
70s.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 33 degrees at Yellowstone
Park, Wyo., to 82 degrees at Laredo, Texas.

   An initiative to slow downtown growth passed
easily, surprising both supporters and opponents and leaving
backers of the measure ecstatic.
   ``We have won on the first try, which I think is remarkable,''
said Ted Inkley, chairman of the campaign for the Citizens
Alternative Plan. ``We had a sense when we began this campaign that
there was a great deal of anger about how government had handled
growth issues in the past 10 years.''
   Initiative 31, known as CAP for Citizens Alternative Plan, won
62 percent approval at the polls Tuesday. With 98 percent of
precincts reporting, the vote was 42,007 to 25,958. A simple
majority was required for passage.
   The plan would limit the height and density of downtown
buildings for the next 10 years while a long-range growth
management plan is adopted. It is exempt from City Council
amendments for two years.
   This city of 500,000 situated across Puget Sound from the
Olympic Mountains already has more than 10 buildings higher than
450 feet. The 76-story Columbia Center is the West Coast's tallest
building.
   Inkley and most opponents _ including the bulk of the city's
business and labor establishment _ had predicted a close vote.
   But Peter Steinbrueck, another backer of the plan, had predicted
approval by as much as 2-1.
   ``I had a feeling in my bones about it,'' Steinbrueck said. ``I
think that the city just didn't buy the incredible claims that were
made (by opponents), and I think that the growth problems were
self-evident.''
   The plan limits the height of new buildings to 450 feet, about
38 stories; protects low-income housing; reduces density of new
projects, and requires a long-term downtown growth management
program.
   Total downtown construction would be limited to 500,000 square
feet of office space a year from 1990 through 1994 and to 1 million
square feet a year from 1995 through 1999.
   The likely impact of the measure remained in doubt.
   Moreover, buildings now under construction, projects vested
under permits issued before the initiative was filed and
development permitted under the initiative are likely to maintain a
surplus of downtown office space well into the 1990s.

<HEAD>Father Found Guilty of Killing Sons in Foundry Ladle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury rejected an insanity defense and
convicted a man who killed his two young sons by putting them in a
red-hot foundry ladle.
   Bartley J. Dobben was found guilty of first-degree murder but
mentally ill in the Thanksgiving Day 1987 deaths of his sons by a
Muskegon County Circuit Court jury on Tuesday.
   First-degree murder carries a mandatory sentence of life without
parole. A guilty but mentally ill verdict allows psychological
treatment for convicts.
   ``We're shocked,'' defense attorney Pat Nolan said, adding he
would appeal the verdict. ``We expected a verdict of not guilty by
reason of insanity. I don't think there was any evidence to support
the verdict.''
   Dobben, 28, of Muskegon, was accused of killing his sons,
Bartley, 2, and Peter, 15 months. He was charged with putting the
boys in a 1,300-degree foundry ladle at the plant where he worked
while his pregnant wife waited outside.
   Circuit Judge James Graves Jr. scheduled sentencing for June 16.
   ``We're satisfied with the verdict,'' county Prosecutor Tony
Tague said. ``Our main concern was that he be confined and not
released into society because he is a danger.''
   The defense contended Dobben, diagnosed a paranoid
schizophrenic, was legally insane at the time of the slayings.
Brett Gardner, an assistant Muskegon County prosecutor, contended
Dobben killed his sons because his marriage of four years was
failing.
   Family and friends portrayed Dobben as a loving, attentive
father who was obsessed with religion and believed the end of the
world was near.
   Bizarre behavior, suspicions that his wife was unfaithful and an
obsessive belief that his family was in danger resulted in a
60-day, court-ordered stay at a psychiatric hospital in late 1985.
   After a relatively calm year during which Dobben took powerful
psychotropic drugs that controlled his behavior, he was persuaded
by a self-ordained minister to stop taking his medication and leave
his wife, witnesses said.
   Susan Dobben testified she forgave her husband a day after the
slayings and wanted him back home with her. The couple's third son
will be 1 year old in June.
   ``He would have given his life for those kids,'' she testified.

<HEAD>20,000 March Through Kwangju Demanding President's Ouster</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KWANGJU, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty thousand people chanting
``Down with the dictatorship'' marched through Kwangju today to
demand the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo for the brutal
suppression of a 1980 uprising.
   Students and workers paraded in front of the provincial
government headquarters for a seventh day to denounce the
government on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the Kwangju
uprising, which left nearly 200 people dead.
   The protesters shouted slogans claiming police killed a radical
student earlier this month. Many office workers joined in the
protest.
   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo,'' hundreds of protesters chanted as they
marched with red, blue and yellow flags and placards with
anti-government slogans.
   Riot police armed with shields and truncheons surrounded
government buildings. Violent clashes between protesters and police
in the square on Tuesday night left about 60 people injured. No
violence was reported today.
   Many Kwangju citizens said they believe the radical student who
was killed earlier this month was tortued to death by the police.
There is no doubt ``that he was murdered,'' a taxi driver said at
today's protest.
   In Seoul, 2,000 college radical students staged peaceful
protests at three colleges today to mark the Kwangju uprising and
call for Roh's downfall. Riot police blocked about 500 students
from marching out of Yonsei University, but there was no fighting.
   Police are on top alert nationwide because of protests expected
Thursday to mark the Kwangju anniversay that began May 18, 1980. At
least 192 people were killed in the nine-day uprising, which was
suppressed by government troops.
   Dissident groups are demanding Roh, who was a senior general at
the time, and other top officials be punished for the suppression
of the uprising. The government says troops were sent in as a last
resort to end a violent uprising.
   Chun Doo-hwan, a senior general at the time of the uprising,
took power as president a few months later with the aid of Roh and
other officers. He imposed a tough authoritarian rule during his
seven-year term.
   Anti-government sentiment in Kwangju was inflamed by the
discovery May 10 of the body of the radical student, Lee Chol-kyu,
in a reservoir near the city. ``Punish Roh Tae-woo who killed Lee
Chol-kyu,'' protesters chanted today.
   Government officials say Lee appears to have fallen into the
reservoir and drowned after fleeing from police who stopped him at
a checkpoint. Officials deny police killed Lee and say an autopsy
proves he drowned in the reservoir.
   Police had been hunting for Lee for anti-government activities,
including writing articles praising communist North Korea.
   South Korea has experienced a wave of violent anti-government
protests and labor strikes in recent months.
   Dissidents and radical students have been calling for the
overthrow of Roh, but they lack support because of their violent
tactics and extremist views.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has been stumping the
cap-and-gown circuit in recent days with a formula: sports,
reminiscences and apologies.
   Bush apologizes for the length of graduation speeches, recalls
his own days at Yale in the late 1940s and employs sports stories
and metaphors _ working in references to a hometown team whenever
possible.
   He selected five colleges for commencement addresses. And with
three down _ Texas A&amp;M, Alcorn State and Mississippi State _ and
two to go _ Boston University and the Coast Guard Academy _ Bush is
beginning to borrow heavily from himself.
   ``I know how deadly long graduation speeches can be. I'll never
forget Yale University where I went,'' Bush tells graduating
seniors. Then he launches into a familiar anecdote about a
long-winded speaker:
   ``A man got up, he says, `I'm going to give you a brief
graduation speech. And I will choose, because our school has a
short name _ Y, is for youth.' He went on for about 30 minutes. And
then it's A, altruism ...'''
   Bush relates that by the time the speaker has gotten through the
four letters of Y-A-L-E, an hour and a half has gone by ``and there
was only one person left, his head bent in prayer.''
   ``Well sir, I see that you are praying for these values,'' the
president's story goes. ``The man said, `no, no. I wasn't praying
for the values. I was giving thanks that I did not go to Alcorn
State University.'''
   That's how he told it at Alcorn State in Lorman, Miss., the
other day. Later, he gave the same joke at Mississippi State in
Starkville, but the punchline was: ``No sir, I was giving thanks
that I didn't go to Mississippi State University.''
   Then Bush ran into trouble. As he finished his speech, he said:
``My friends, you've worked hard and studied hard and struggled for
four years. And now you've endured the hardest part: listening to
the commencement address.
   ``And I haven't even begun. Let's see: Y-M-I-S ...''
   Bush does better on sports than on spelling.
   The captain of the 1948 Yale baseball team told Texas A&amp;M
graduates: ``When you look back at your days at Texas A&amp;M, you will
have a lot to be proud of _ a university that is first in baseball
and first in service to our nation.''
   At Alcorn State, Bush said: ``The Alcorn Braves know that you
can't steal second base and keep one foot on first.'' He paused, a
bemused expression crossing his face as he mulled over the line.
``That's profound,'' he said.
   And, at Mississippi State, Bush declared: ``I've been lucky. A
wonderful wife and five great kids. Five kids and 11 lively
grandkids, and by themselves, they could field the Bulldog's entire
pitching staff.''
   Bush surveyed the stadium audience. ``And I understand you
people with the earphones staying plugged into the baseball game.
If I were sitting up there, I'd be doing exactly the same thing,''
he said.
   Bush also has been sneaking the ``new breeze'' he talked about
in his inaugural address into his college speeches. He told Texas
A&amp;M seniors that ``a new breeze is blowing across the steppes and
cities of the Soviet Union.''
   At Alcorn State, he said, ``Politics is hardly the only arena
where a new breeze is blowing. Some of you will land in business,
maybe even start a business where you can create jobs adding to the
opportunity of other Americans ...''
   At Texas A&amp;M, Bush gave what was billed as a major foreign
policy speech on U.S.-Soviet relations. But he was apologetic about
it, telling his audience: ``It had to happen. Your last day in
college had to end with yet another political science lecture!''
   Bush's wife, Barbara, has also been spending time on campus.
   The other day, smiling in a black cap and gown at commencement
at Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C., she recalled her advice to
her own children: ``Clean your plate, remember the starving Chinese
... don't put that in your ear ... don't cross your eyes ... don't
put that in your mouth, you don't know where it's been.''

<NOTE>___</NOTE>

   In addition to sowing seeds of wisdom at college graduations,
Bush is also traipsing around the nation planting trees for state
centennial ceremonies.
   However, the first tree he transplanted from the White House
lawn, an elm for the grounds of the North Dakota Capitol at
Bismarck, turned out to be infected with destructive gypsy moth
larvae.
   Bush is expected to plant more trees in the coming months in
South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and Washington state. White House
aides are hopeful they won't harbor the same unwelcome guests.

   Fewer wars were fought last year,
worldwide military spending declined and the global arms trade
leveled off, reversing the warlike trends of the 1980s, researchers
said today.
   But ballistic missiles with nuclear capabilities have
proliferated, ``one of the most disturbing developments'' of recent
years, said Walter Stuetzle, director of the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute.
   Seventeen Third World nations have deployed ballistic missiles
and at least seven more have them or are trying to acquire them,
the institute said in its 1988 yearbook.
   Speaking at a news conference, Stuetzle said ``no effective
mechanism has been established to control this development.''
   But the institute's report also said the number of wars fell
from 33 to 28 and some appeared close to a resolution by year's end.
   ``There was a clear break in the pattern of a constant increase
in the number of major conflicts with which the world had grown
accustomed during the 1980s,'' the report says.
   Since World War II, more than 160 regional and civil wars _
defined as involving more than 1,000 deaths _ have been fought, the
530-page annual report says.
   The institute, an independent group funded mostly by the Swedish
parliament, monitors developments in weapons trading and arms
control.
   Stuetzle, a former West German undersecretary of defense, wrote
in the report that ``1988 has seen remarkable progress towards a
potentially more peaceful world,'' and that relations between the
two superpowers may determine whether existing conflicts can be
settled.
   But at today's news conference, Stuetzle faulted the United
States for failing to agree to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
call for nuclear arms talks.
   ``In the last 12 months we have witnessed a tremendous series of
initiatives by President Gorbachev in the fields of arms control
and reduction,'' he said.
   ``I think it's a great tragedy that with a Gorbachev in the
Kremlin, there is no J.F. Kennedy in the White House,'' he said,
referring to Kennedy's call to never fear negotiations.
   Agreements were reached to end hostilities in the Iran-Iraq war,
the conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia, the war between Chad and
Libya and in the conflicts in Angola and Namibia.
   Moscow began withdrawing troops from Aghanistan, Vietnam
announced it would pull out of Cambodia and fighting subsided in
Nicaragua, where U.S.-backed rebels appear to be giving up their
fight against the leftist government.
   Also, tensions eased between India and Pakistan, between Laos
and Thailand and in internal disputes in Uganda.
   However, civil wars escalated in Afghanistan, Somalia, Ethiopia
and Burma and Iraq used chemical weapons against its Kurdish
minority, the report said.
   Fighting continued in Sri Lanka and the Palestinian uprising
worsened in the Israeli-occupied territories. Fighting intensified
in southern Sudan and the Philippines, it said.
   The United States cut real military spending for the third year
in a row, NATO defense spending was down 3 percent from 1987 and
spending by the Warsaw Pact countries was unchanged, it said. The
Soviet Union and China were believed to have trimmed spending.
   Worldwide trade in conventional arms totaled $34 billion,
measured in 1985 prices, down slightly from the previous year's
record figure, the report says.
   The share bought by Third World countries dropped from 66
percent in 1986 to 61.4 percent last year.
   The report says the U.S. share of the global arms market was 28
percent, and the Soviets took 38 percent. India was the biggest
Third World buyer last year, followed by Iraq, North Korea, and
Saudi Arabia, the report says.

<HEAD>Official Affirms Japan's Ability to Produce FSX Alone</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan will proceed with plans to develop its next
jet fighter with the United States, but it remains capable of
producing the plane alone, Defense Agency chief Kichiro Tazawa said
today.
   He spoke at a televised session of a parliamentary budget
committee the day after the U.S. Senate voted to endorse the
co-production agreement but adopted an amendment imposing tougher
conditions on the flow of U.S. technology.
   The State Department said the amendment, which prohibits the
transfer of advanced jet engine technology to Japan, may force a
renegotiation of the pact. Opponents charge the plan gives Japan
access to advanced U.S. aviation technology that would allow it to
become a competitor. Supporters say it creates U.S. jobs and
maintains U.S.-Japan defense compatibility.
   ``While being fully confident in being able to develop the plane
ourselves, we will proceed with joint development, with the goal of
producing the best possible new fighter jet,'' Tazawa said.
   Other Defense Agency and Foreign Ministry officials declined
comment, saying Tuesday's vote was a domestic U.S. issue.
   Japan originally planned to develop on its own the fighter plane
dubbed the FSX. U.S. officials then asked Japan to buy U.S.-made
planes to reduce the two countries' large trade imbalance.
   Japanese officials refused, saying current U.S. aircraft would
be unable to meet their defense needs in coming decades. The two
sides then compromised on a co-production arrangement.
   Japan was one of the world's top aircraft makers in World War
II, but U.S. occupation authorities shut down its aircraft industry
for seven years after the war.
   In the 1960s, Japan produced a commercial airliner, the YS-11,
that was regarded as a technical success but a marketing failure.
It also developed its current jet fighter, the F-1.
   Japan builds domestic versions of the F-15 fighter jet and P-3C
anti-submarine plane under license from U.S. manufacturers.
   Many aviation industry analysts believe development of future
commercial airliners will require international cooperation because
of the huge cost, complexity and risks. In one such arrangement,
Japan produces portions of the fuselage for the Boeing 767
passenger jet.

<HEAD>Sheriff Confirms Green River Task Force Winding Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven years after the Green River serial killer
claimed his first victim, the police task force formed to track the
slayer is slowly being phased out, a sheriff said. No arrests have
been made.
   The killer, the subject of a nationally syndicated television
show in December, is officially blamed for the deaths of as many as
48 young women, many of them prostitutes, between the summer of
1982 and early 1984. Four victims were found in Oregon, but the
killer operated primarily in the Puget Sound area.
   The task force, which totaled more than 40 people, including FBI
agents, at its peak, now comprises eight detectives, two sergeants
and two desk clerks, KIRO-TV reported Tuesday night.
   King County Sheriff James Montgomery said police officers once
assigned to the nation's worst unsolved serial murder case were
needed elsewhere to fight the county's rising crime rate.
   Although Montgomery said the task force is gradually being
phased out, he did not say when it might be disbanded completely.
   ``I suspect it'll be one of those days when we'll just simply
say, `Where did it go?''' the sheriff told the TV station.
   In July 1988, when the task force numbered about 20 officers,
Montgomery said he would recommend reducing it by mid-1989 unless
there were fresh leads in the case.
   Capt. Bob Evans, commander of the task force, said two months
ago that the TV movie ``Manhunt: A Chance to End the Nightmare''
produced 3,500 telephone tips and yielded arrests in two other
cases.
   Montgomery said the task force reduction does not make ``any
statement at all about what we feel about the victims. It's a
matter of we have to continue on with what's going on in this
particular region today.''
   The case takes its name from the Green River in south King
County, where the bodies of the first five victims were found in
the summer of 1982.

<HEAD>More Than 1 Million March Through Beijing</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with students saying agreement with

   More than 1 million people demanding democracy
and supporting student hunger strikes marched triumphantly through
Beijing streets today in the biggest protest in Communist China's
40-year history.
   Two student representatives met later with government and party
officials and said they were optimistic an agreement would be
reached soon on their demands, which include formal talks with the
government to be broadcast live.
   The protest began after student leaders rejected Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang's appeal that 3,000 students end a four-day fast
that has been the catalyst for this week's unrest.
   Today's huge march through the streets of the capital was the
biggest of the pro-democracy rallies that have embarrassed the
government during Mikhail S. Gorbachev's historic visit and forced
major changes in his schedule.
   The protest was dominated today for the first time by workers
rather than students. The march began in central Tiananmen Square,
the site of the hunger strike, to the sound of firecrackers set off
under the huge poster of Mao Tse-tung at the entrance to the former
Imperial Palace.
   Protesters draped banners from the rostrum over the gate, where
Mao declared the founding of the People's Republic on Oct. 1, 1949.
Many banners called for the retirement of 84-year-old senior leader
Deng Xiaoping and the resignation of Premier Li Peng.
   Fifty taxis stuffed with flag-waving passengers led a procession
of workers, journalists, government employees and even soldiers.
   Smaller marches headed outward from the square, China's symbolic
center of power, while more people streamed on bicycle and foot
toward the square, which has been clogged for four days by
protesters.
   Most streets in the center of this city of 10 million people
were clogged. Police made no effort to intervene and few were seen
on the streets.
   ``Chinese aren't stupid,'' said marching journalist Shen
Yinghua. ``You can suppress us for a long time, but when we blow,
we spit fire.''
   Later in the day, two students met with the secretaries of Zhao
and Li.
   ``Tonight we could have some good news,'' said one of the
student representatives, Cheng Zhen.
   Students also agreed that police would help direct snarled
traffic and clear paths for ambulances in streets jammed with
marchers. Police began guarding shopping areas to prevent possible
looting.
   The students prepared an open letter to the city's residents
urging they refrain from any violence.
   As pro-democracy protesters massed in the square this morning,
Gorbachev met with academicians in the adjacent Great Hall of the
People.
   The protests forced him to cancel a visit to the Imperial
Palace, the latest in a series of schedule changes they have forced.
   ``All these rallies made us nervous,'' Gorbachev said in an
interview broadcast by Chinese television. But he said his visit,
which has produced a normalization of Sino-Soviet relations after a
30-year chill, was going well.
   Similar demonstrations grew in size today in Shanghai, where
Gorbachev is scheduled to fly Thursday. At least 70 student
hunger-strikers lay in front of the Shanghai city hall, while about
20,000 students and supporters gathered around to chant for the
resignation of Shanghai Mayor Jiang Zemin. Many of the students
later marched across town.
   An American witness said the Shanghai protest began Tuesday and
grew today. Police cordoned off the area and tried to keep out
non-students, but thousands of workers managed to join them.
   Smaller marches were reported in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, both
near Hong Kong.
   In Beijing, laborers marched with banners naming their
factories. At least 1,000 soldiers joined the protest. Their
banners identified them as from the general staff office, logistics
department and political department.
   ``We're just regular soldiers, we want democracy and freedom
too,'' said a lieutenant.
   Employees from at least five government ministries participated,
as did 300 representatives from Capital Steel marching under a
banner that read: ``Return us our freedom.''
   Some postal workers declared themselves on strike and marched,
and there were unconfirmed rumors of other strikes. But most
workers said they would be back at work Thursday.
   In Tiananmen Square, the strikers lay under umbrellas and tents
fashioned from sheets for protection from the sun. At one point,
they recited their hunger-strike vow, with those able to standing
up.
   By this afternoon, 1,300 strikers had been sent to hospitals
after fainting. However, many came back after being revived and
given glucose.
   Marchers were concerned particularly with 10 hunger strikers who
have refused to drink water since early Tuesday and three who began
refusing water late Tuesday.
   In a message delivered to hunger strikers after midnight on
behalf of the top Communist Party leadership, Zhao affirmed the
students' patriotic spirit but asked that they end the strike.
   He promised that protesters would not face punishment and vowed
to ``work out concrete measures to enhance democracy and law (and)
oppose corruption,'' according to a report by the official Xinhua
News Agency.
   Zhao initially rejected demands for a dialogue with officials to
be broadcast live, but student leaders said they were optimistic
their demands would be met following the second meeting with
officials today.
   The effect of the protest on China's political make-up is not
yet clear, although some student leaders claim a Communist Party
official has warned that the strike could damage the position of
the so-called liberal faction that supports market-oriented
economic reform.
   But one student said the fasters ``are not starving here simply
to help some old man get more power. We are here for our whole
country. We want to go beyond factions.''

flimsy cellophane covering.

<HEAD>Hamadi Convicted in TWA Hijack; Stethems Warn Against Deals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A court today convicted Mohammed
Ali Hamadi of air piracy and murder and sentenced him to life
imprisonment in the 1985 TWA hijacking that left a U.S. Navy diver
dead.
   He received the maximum penalty under West German law.
   The three-judge District Court convicted the Lebanese Shiite
Moslem for his role in the 17-day hijacking of 39 Americans and the
brutal beating and shooting of Robert Dean Stethem of Waldorf, Md.
Stethem's body was tossed from the plane onto the tarmac at Beirut
Airport.
   In a statement following the sentencing, Stethem's parents said
Hamadi should have received the death penalty, which is not allowed
under West German law. They also warned against any political deals
that might free him early.
   Hamadi, 24, admitted to taking part in the hijacking of Flight
847 from Athens to Rome but denied killing Stethem.
   He looked straight ahead impassively as Chief Judge Heiner
Mueckenberger read the verdict to a packed courtroom inside
Frankfurt's fortress-like Preungesheim prison.
   Mueckenberger said the court found Hamadi guilty of ``joint
participation in murder.'' By law, a defendant taking part in a
serious crime may be convicted of murder even if he does not
actually kill the victim.
   ``He was an active member of Hezbollah,'' the judge said,
referring to the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems believed holding
foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   The court also found Hamadi guilty on three counts of
hostage-taking and inflicting grevious bodily harm, and two counts
of smuggling explosives into West Germany.
   Hamadi testified that the hijacking was intended to force the
release of Lebanese Moslems imprisoned in Israel. Shortly after the
ordeal, Israel released about 700 such prisoners.
   Dozens of former passengers said Hamadi was one of two hijackers
who brutally beat Stethem. He claimed his accomplice, who remains
at large, pulled the trigger. Court records identified the
accomplice as Hassan Ezzeddine.
   Mueckenberger said that while the court could not determine
whether Hamadi murdered Stethem, ``the defendant played an active
role in preparing and carrying it out.''
   After sentencing, Hamadi hung his head, then stared straight
ahead.
   Later, Stethem's father, Richard Stethem, his wife Patricia at
his side, read a statement to reporters, breaking the silence they
maintained throughout the trial. They attended all 65 sessions.
   ``Our family maintains Mohammed Ali Hamadi deserves punishment
more severe than life imprisonment,'' Richard Stethem said. He also
warned against a ``possible political commutation of his sentence
in the future.''
   ``Any commutation of Hamadi's sentence would be a pure mockery
of justice,'' Stethem said.
   Last week, Frankfurt lawyer Rainer Hamm said the Stethems were
concerned that kidnappings or other types of ``blackmail'' might
lead West German authorities to release Hamadi early. Hamm
represented the American co-prosecutors.
   Peter Korneck, a trial prosecutor, said Hamadi could first apply
for parole in 15 years but that he would have to meet numerous
conditions to be granted freedom.
   Security outside the courtroom was tighter than it had been for
much of the 10-month trial, in which more than three dozen
Americans including pilots and passengers testified.
   During the hijacking, Flight 847 was forced to fly three times
to Beirut and twice to Algiers, Algeria. Stethem was killed when
the plane landed the second time in Beirut on June 15, 1985.
   Another Navy diver, Clinton Suggs of Elkhart, Ind., and
passenger Kurt Carlson of Rockford, Ill., were among the most
viciously beaten.
   The Hamadi case strained relations between the United States and
West Germany after Hamadi's arrest. Bonn denied a U.S. extradition
request after two West German businessmen were kidnapped in Beirut.
   The two were taken hostage within a week of Hamadi's arrest at
Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987, when customs officials found
liquid explosives in his luggage.
   Hamadi's brother, Abbas Hamadi, was convicted of masterminding
the kidnappings to force Mohammed's release. He was sentenced to 13
years in prison by a Duesseldorf court.
   The West German hostages, Alfred Schmidt and Rudolf Cordes, were
released in September 1987 and September 1988, respectively.
   The Hamadi trial began on July 5. Officials spent $6.3 million
to convert the dining hall at Preungesheim prison into a
high-security courtroom with an elaborate intercom system and
double glass walls to separate spectators from the courtroom.
   Those entering the courtroom were repeatedly searched, and
dozens of armed police, some mounted on horses and others carrying
submachine guns, patrolled the area.

   The parents of a U.S. Navy diver
slain during a TWA hijacking said today the court that convicted
Mohammed Ali Hamadi of air piracy and murder should have sentenced
him to death.
   After the court sentenced Hamadi to life in prison, the parents
said they hoped Hamadi would be forced to serve the full sentence.
   Their son, 23-year-old Robert Dean Stethem, was brutally beaten
and shot to death when the plane was hijacked to Beirut in June
1985.
   Richard Stethem, his wife Patricia at his side, read a statement
to reporters after the sentencing, breaking the silence they
maintained throughout the 10-month trial. The parents attended all
65 sessions.
   They indicated they were disappointed that Hamadi, a Lebanese
Shiite Moslem, could not receive the death penalty under West
German law. Life in prison is the maximum sentence.
   ``Our family maintains Mohammed Ali Hamadi deserves punishment
more severe,'' Richard Stethem said. He also warned against a
``possible political commutation of his sentence in the future.''
   ``We mention this because the thought of such a release is
painful for us to think of. Any commutation of Hamadi's sentence
would be a pure mockery of justice,'' Stethem said.
   Last week, Frankfurt lawyer Rainer Hamm said the Stethems and
the other 17 Americans who helped prosecute the case were concerned
that kidnappings or other types of ``blackmail'' might lead West
German authorities to release Hamadi early. Hamm represented the
American co-prosecutors.
   In the statement, Richard Stethem said: ``We would hope any
release would result in a public outcry by German and American
citizens alike and would cause people to express outrage against
this type of political injustice.''
   ``We would expect our present administration, State Department,
department of justice and Congress to monitor the fulfillment of
this sentence and to ensure it is completely served,'' Stethem
said, in a conference room at the Frankfurt prison where the trial
was held.
   He indicated, however, that he was satisified with the result so
far.
   ``We feel the German courts conducted a fair and impartial trial
resulting in an appropriate finding of guilt. We have remained
confident that with the conclusion of the many testimonies of the
American witnesses, nothing less than a life sentence would
result,'' Stethem noted.
   The Hamadi case strained relations between the United States and
West Germany after Hamadi's arrest. Bonn denied a U.S. extradition
request after two West German businessmen were kidnapped in Beirut.
   The two were taken hostage within a week of Hamadi's arrest at

   Jessica Hahn, the former secretary whose
sexual liaison with Jim Bakker crumbled his PTL ministry, appeared
on a radio broadcast today near his ministry and challenged him to
a meeting.
   ``I don't want anything sloppy,'' she said on WBJW's ``Breakfast
Bunch'' talk show, which was being broadcast from a bar a few
hundred feet from Bakker's new ministry.
   ``It's never been done to have Jim Bakker and me set down and
tell our story,'' she said. ``I just want the healing process to
start.
   ``I'm not afraid of a confrontation. I think you are,'' she
said, addressing Bakker. ``Come out here for five minutes,
one-on-one.''
   It couldn't immediately be learned if Bakker was listening to
the program. The Bakkers said Tuesday they would delay the daily
taping of their ``Jim and Tammy'' show until late this afternoon to
avoid Ms. Hahn and the hoopla surrounding her.
   Ms. Hahn was broadcasting from the Sports Page, a bar across the
parking lot from the new television ministry Jim and Tammy Bakker
set up in a nearly abandoned shopping mall in southwest Orlando.
   Tom Hoof, promotions manager for WBJW-FM and WBJW-AM in Winter
Park, had said Tuesday the station didn't want a confrontation, but
today his morning show co-hosts joined Ms. Hahn in taking telephone
pledges for Bakker's new ministry and inviting him to pick up the
money.
   ``We'll give you a check,'' Ms. Hahn said. ``I just want to talk
to you for about two seconds.''
   By 8:15 a.m. they had pledges for $1,163, including donations by
the station itself.
   Hoof wouldn't say what Hahn is being paid for the appearance.

<HEAD>Communist Poland Officially Recognizes Catholic Church</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Parliament approved laws today that
guarantee freedom of worship and give legal status to the Roman
Catholic Church, formally ending the communist state's four-decade
struggle with the church.
   Passage of the three bills is expected to clear the way to
formal diplomatic ties with the Vatican, which for years has
refused to grant relations until the Polish church's legal status
was resolved.
   If ties are normalized, it would make Poland the first East bloc
country to have such relations with the Holy See.
   The bills were introduced last month by Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and they passed without serious opposition
in the Sejm, or parliament.
   One bill defines the state's attitude toward the church as a
sovereign organization operating within the Constitution but free
to manage its internal affairs. It passed the 460-member Sejm with
two votes against and 12 absentions.
   A second bill grants equal rights to all denominations, bars
discrimination based on religion and guarantees freedom of worship.
Three lawmakers voted against it and three abstained.
   The third bill entitles clergy to state old-age pensions. It
passed with seven votes against and 10 abstentions.
   The legislation was drafted as a result of protracted
negotiations between the Roman Catholic Church and the government.
   More than 90 percent of Poles consider themselves Catholic, and
in recent years the state had abandoned atheistic propaganda and
sought to portray itself as tolerant of religious faith.
   The laws passed today in effect replace an agreement between
church and state that existed before World War II but was abrogated
when communists took power after the war.
   ``We have been waiting for this law for 37 years,'' said Marek
Pernal, a spokesman in the episcopate press office in Warsaw.
   In the 1940s and 1950s, church property was seized and clergy
were arrestd. The Roman Catholic primate at the time, Cardinal
Stefan Wyszynski, was held prisoner for three years from 1953 to
1956.
   Since former Krakow Archbishop Karol Wojtyla became Pope John
Paul II in 1978, the state has moved to patch up relations with the
church, seeing it as a stabilizing factor in the country's often
volatile politics.
   Church officials were instrumental in helping to set up the
talks that led to the accord that legalized the Solidarity trade
union and allowed opposition participation in elections.
   Some Poles recently have expressed concern about the degree of
church influence in public life. The church supports a bill before
the Sejm that would make abortion a crime punishable by three years
in prison. Abortion has been legal in Poland since 1956.

   Oil was spilled early today into a dry fountain
in front of the Exxon building in Manhattan, and a caller claiming
responsibility said it was in retaliation for the company's giant
oil spill in Alaska.
   A caller identifying himself only as an Alaskan told The
Associated Press he and a fellow Alaskan had dumped 50 gallons of
oil in the Exxon fountain, which has been under repair.
   They did it so Exxon executives ``might feel a little closer to
the story'' of the oil spilled March 24 from the tanker Exxon
Valdez, he said, and ``to protest that it's taking a long time to
clean up.''
   ``It was a very small amount, and we're cleaning it up,'' said
Vince Silvestri, spokesman for the Rockefeller Center office
complex. He said it appeared to be motor oil.
   Silvestri said it was ``extremely considerably less than 50
gallons.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today promised a new era of
peace in the Far East, said the Red Army would reduce its forces in
the area and urged Washington to pull its soldiers out of South
Korea.
   As the Soviet president spoke, a mighty flood of more than 1
million Chinese poured into the streets to demonstrate for
democratic reforms in China and took control of the center of
Beijing.
   In his speech to Chinese academics in the Great Hall of the
People, Gorbachev said the 4,300-mile-long Soviet-Chinese frontier
should be turned into a ``border of peace.''
   Gorbachev's historic visit to Beijing is to normalize relations
after a 30-year chill between the two largest communist countries.
   At the news conference later, Gorbachev defended socialist
countries experiencing unrest as they try to reform their systems.
   ``If anyone thinks this will lead us to the ash heap of history,
I think they will be disappointed again,'' Gorbachev said.
   The news conference was delayed because it was moved to another
location to avoid the hundreds of thousands of marching protesters.
   ``I would not try to assume the role of a judge,'' Gorbachev
said when asked about the student unrest.
   But he stressed that such problems ``reaffirm the fact that
changes under way are of a profound nature.
   ``Some regard this as a crisis of socialism,'' he said.
Problems, he said, ``may bring some pain. But we will stay the
course'' of democratic reforms.
   He made a point of acknowledging receipt of a letter from the
students who led the demonstrations, saying it was ``a very warm
letter, full of feelings of support for perestroika,'' Gorbachev's
reform program.
   During a trip outside the city to visit the Great Wall,
Gorbachev's motorcade passed waves of demonstrators making their
way in trucks, buses, by bicycle and on foot toward downtown.
   Within hours, central Beijing streets were crammed with
students, workers, teachers and journalists swelling out of central
Tiananmen Square into the streets to march for democracy.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, canceled plans to tour the
Forbidden City because of the large crowds.
   The Soviet leader said at the news conference today that he
``got a little emotional'' from the warmth of young people he met
during a visit to the Great Wall today. ``But I'm human.'' He added
that ``I feel those three decades were as if they never were.''
   In his speech a day after the first Sino-Soviet summit since
1959, Gorbachev called for a regional security network in Asia that
would provide a means of settling disputes.
   And he said an earlier pledge to withdraw 200,000 troops from
Asia would be fulfilled by the end of 1990 and would include the
pullout of 12 divisions, or 120,000 soldiers, from the China
frontier.
   The Soviet Union is believed to have 600,000 troops along the
Chinese border. The Chinese, armed with older equipment, have more
than 1 million troops stationed there.
   Gorbachev said 11 air force regiments would be disbanded and 16
warships removed from the Pacific Fleet.
   Gorbachev added that the Soviet Union is ``prepared to work for
the withdrawal, on terms to be agreed with China, of military units
and armaments from the border areas, leaving only the personnel
required for performing routine border guard duties.''
   ``Demilitarizing the Soviet-Chinese border and turning it into a
border of peace and good-neighborliness is a noble goal that we
could attain through joint efforts,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, in a meeting with Premier Li Peng, Gorbachev said
``we want the Soviet-Chinese border to be protected only by
friendship.'' He also called for regular consultations between the
militaries of the two countries.
   The two sides fought a brief border war over the disputed
frontier in 1969, and sporadic clashes have continued for years.
   On Monday, the day Gorbachev arrived in Beijing, Moscow began
pulling troops out of Mongolia, the Soviet ally along China's
northern border. The Kremlin has said it will withdraw 50,000
troops, three-fourths of the Soviet force in Mongolia, by the end
of 1990.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who heads China's military, also
has reduced the People's Liberation Army from more than 4 million
in 1985 to about 3 million today. Most of those troops are
stationed along the Soviet border and China's volatile border with
Vietnam.
   China and other Asian nations have been cool to Gorbachev's
concept of collective security in Asia, expressing fear it is a
Soviet attempt to increase its strategic influence in the area.
   On Tuesday, the two sides announced the normalization of
government and party relations, ending a 30-year rift caused by
ideological and strategic differences and disputes over Soviet
actions in Afghanistan and Cambodia.
   The summit brought the leaders of the Soviet Union and China
together for the first time since a frosty encounter between Nikita
S. Khrushchev and Mao Tse-Tung in 1959.

   A childbirth film and a little coaching from a
911 operator were all 7-year-old Amanda Lawrence needed to help her
mother, who went into labor and gave birth at home minutes later.
   ``I think I did a great job, and it was a good idea I helped
little Zachary be born,'' Amanda said after her baby brother's
arrival.
   Amanda's mother, Teri Lawrence, and William Zachary Lawrence
were doing very well Tuesday night at Northside Hospital, said
spokeswoman Carol King.
   Amanda was about to leave for school Tuesday morning when her
mother went into labor. She helped her mother to a sofa and dialed
the operator for help, said her father, Edwin.
   The operator connected Amanda with 911 operators, who instructed
the little girl how to help her mother while an ambulance was
heading to their home in suburban Acworth.
   The 6-pound, 9-ounce boy was born three minutes later.
   ``I was talking on the phone, and the water broke,'' Amanda
said. ``I could see the baby coming, but the operator kept talking
to me and told me to wrap the baby up to keep it warm until the
ambulance got there.
   ``I was shocked, but I knew what was going on, even though he
came out a little purplish, purple-blue,'' she said. ``I even got
to hold him.''
   Rescue workers arrived at the home 15 minutes later and took the
Lawrences to Northside Hospital.
   ``I'm just so proud of her,'' Lawrence said of his daughter.
``Amanda was fine about it until her mother started carrying on a
little from the pain, but the operator kept her calm.''
   Ms. King said the girl had to provide information that the
mother couldn't give herself.
   ``She had to give directions to the house, which was on streets
that aren't marked, and get towels for her mom and unlock the doors
for the ambulance,'' Ms. King said.
   ``Thank goodness she was here because I couldn't get to the
phone,'' Mrs. Lawrence said from her hospital bed.
   Mrs. Lawrence said she and her baby were expected to go home
today.
   Just weeks ago, Ms. King said, Amanda had attended a
childbirthing course. She said the Lawrences attended a refresher
course and brought Amanda along when they couldn't find a baby
sitter.
   ``We saw that she was taking in the film,'' Lawrence said. ``She
knew that when her mom's water broke, it was just a matter of
time.''
   The couple's second child, which was due around June 1, arrived
on their eighth wedding anniversary.
   Amanda said she can't wait to take her little brother home.
   ``We're having a party to welcome him home and thank me for such
a great job I did to help him be born,'' she said.

   Premier Yu Kuo-hwa said today he has
resigned to preserve party unity and make way for a younger person.
   Yu, who has been premier since 1984, said he submitted his
resignation to President Lee Teng-hui earlier this week. It was not
immediately known whether it was accepted.
   ``I am resigning to maintain the unity of the ruling party ...
and to let younger people take this position,'' Yu said at a news
conference.
   Yu, 75, has been accused by members of the governing Nationalist
Party of being too conservative. News reports have said party
members intended to push for his resignation at a three-day party
meeting that begins June 3.
   Lu Ya-li, political science professor at the National Taiwan
University, said many members of the Nationalist Party believe Yu's
resignation will help strengthen the party in a congressional
election in December.
   The mass-circulation China Times Express said Lee plans to meet
Thursday with Lee Huan, secretary-general of the governing party,
to discuss the resignation.
   The newspaper said Lee Huan, 72, and Chiu Chuang-huan, 64,
Taiwan's provincial governor, are possible candidates to succeed Yu.

<TEXT>
   Greek and Turkish Cypriot forces today
abandoned 24 military posts along the line that divides Nicosia,
complying with a U.N. plan for easing tensions in the capital.
   Maj. Gen. Clive Milner, the Canadian commander of the U.N. force
that has been on the Mediterranean island since 1964, said the
limited disengagement was ``an important first step'' toward
reducing the chances of confrontation.
   A U.N. statement said the Greek Cypriot National Guard and the
Turkish Cypriot forces each pulled out of 12 observation posts in
three sectors along the dividing Green Line.
   In some sections of the buffer zone, rival forces were only a
few yards apart.
   Government spokesman Akis Fantis said the withdrawal was ``a
first step toward the full demilitarization of Nicosia.''
   Cyprus has been devided since July 1974, when the Turkish army
invaded after a coup by militant Greek Cypriots seeking unity with
Greece.
   The Turks seized the northern third of the island. The minority
Turkish Cypriots, 18 percent of the 650,000 population, declared a
breakaway republic there in 1983.
   Milner said today's Nicosia withdrawal ``will help prevent
incidents and reduce tension in the city.''
   It follows a sharp increase in violence along the 112-mile
buffer zone that slices the island in two. The zone is patrolled by
2,180 soldiers from nine countries in the U.N. Force in Cyprus.
   A Greek Cypriot National Guard soldier shot and wounded a
Turkish Cypriot soldier on the Green Line in Nicosia on May 7, then
killed himself.
   Five people were killed by gunfire between May and December last
year, the same number of fatalities reported between 1976 and last
May.
   The limited pullback came amid reunification talks that are
making little headway between President George Vassiliou, the Greek
Cypriot leader, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
   The government was expected to begin repairing 60 houses around
the abandoned posts to encourage Greek Cypriots to return to the
long-deserted area.

   A 12-year-old boy pleaded guilty today
to murder and arson charges in a New Year's Eve fire that killed
his baby sitter.
   Scott James clutched a handful of baseball cards and frequently
grinned at his attorney after changing his plea in District Court.
   Assistant Attorney General Eric Wright had originally charged
the boy with juvenile charges of murder under three theories and
agreed to dismiss two of the counts today in exchange for the
guilty pleas.
   James told Judge Alexander MacNichol that he started the fire
that killed Raymond R. Lauzon, 53, of Biddeford, but disputed the
prosecution's contention that he told his younger brother he wanted
to see what it was like to kill the man.
   Wright said the youth, who was 11 at the time, started the fire
after Lauzon caught him trying to steal some money from his wallet.
The boy and his brother, Jason, were staying in Lauzon's apartment
while their mother, Janet Sullivan, went to a pub with Lauzon's son
Ronald.
   The judge ordered James returned to the Maine Youth Center in
South Portland pending a May 30 disposition hearing.
   Under the maximum sentence, James could be incarcerated until he
is 21 but Wright told reporters he hopes something can be done to
help the youngster.
   ``We hope that something good will come out of it for him,'' he
said.

<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loyal troops defeated rebellious
soldiers and re-established control over the capital today, but
thousands of soldiers in the north reportedly joined leaders of a
coup attempt.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam cut short a state visit to East
Berlin and was on his way home this afternoon, the East German
state news agency reported as the second day of the revolt drew to
a close.
   Two dissident generals were killed Tuesday in the rebellion,
which began after Mengistu left Addis Ababa for East Berlin,
Ethiopian state radio said. The Ethiopian leader of 15 years was
scheduled to return home Thursday.
   There were unconfirmed reports that the defense minister, Maj.
Gen. Haile Giorgis Habte Mariam, was slain by dissident officers
early in the revolt, but the radio made no mention of his death.
   ``In Addis itself, it's increasingly looking like a failed coup,
but it appears to be a very different story in other parts of the
country and especially in the north,'' said a Western diplomat in
the capital. ``It's a very fluid situation.''
   Government broadcasts from Addis Ababa's closed Bole
International Airport warned commercial and private pilots not to
fly over northern Asmara city, capital of the Eritrean Province
that has been in revolt against the government for 28 years.
   Asmara is the headquarters of Ethiopia's 2nd Army, consisting of
150,000 soldiers. Diplomats believed many of them were siding with
coup leaders. Ethiopia has Africa's largest and most well-armed
army. But many of its quarter of a million soldiers are unwilling
conscripts.
   ``We're just not sure what's going on in Asmara, whether the
army has handed its arms to the EPLF (the rebel Eritrean People's
Liberation Front) or whether it remains a viable, unified force in
opposition to the government,'' the diplomat said on condition of
anonymity.
   Even as Addis Ababa Radio was saying the revolt had been
crushed, another radio station was claiming victory for dissident
soldiers.
   The second station, broadcasting on a frequency normally used by
the government radio station in Asmara, said the government had
been overthrown and called on the armed forces to unite behind the
coup leaders.
   The second day of the revolt dawned with a pitched tank and
artillery battle at an old, abandoned airport on the outskirts of
Addis Ababa which houses a number of military compounds.
   ``It was thunderous,'' said the diplomat. ``You could feel
buildings shaking here in the city.
   ``After that, things calmed down for a while, but then there
were several fairly severe firefights around town. What we think
was happening is that loyal troops were flushing out insurgents who
were in hiding.''
   By midafternoon the city appeared calm again, said the diplomat.
``But the situation is obviously quite tense and the army is
everywhere around the city.''
   All offices, shops and schools in the capital were closed. State
radio urged citizens to remain in their homes. Key government
offices were heavily guarded.
   An African military attache based in Addis Ababa said the army
garrison in Harar, in eastern Ethiopia, also was supporting the
coup attempt and that negotiations were under way in the capital
between loyalist and dissident military leaders.
   ``Things are bad,'' the attache said. ``It is just that they
(the government) are not saying.''
   Addis Ababa Radio made no mention of the new fighting around the
capital this morning. Throughout the day, it repeated a communique
from Ethiopia's State Council reporting the deaths of two coup
leaders.
   Maj. Gen. Merid Negusie, the chief of staff, and Maj. Gen. Amha
Desta, commander of the air force, were killed by loyalist troops
in the early hours of the revolt, it said.
   There have been persistent reports of military unrest in
Ethiopia, especially among field commanders who reportedly feel the
government has not supported them adequately in the northern civil
war.
   ``Some conspiring generals wanted to create great unrest and
disturbance, to shed the blood of innocent people and generally
destabilize the unity of our motherland, even though their
treacherous aims did not succeed,'' Addis Ababa Radio said.
   ``They tried to use force but were killed,'' the broadcast said.
``Most of the conspiring generals have been forced to surrender.''
It gave no further details.
   The military deposed Emperor Haile Selassie in a coup on Sept.
12, 1974, and a provisional military government was established.
After fighting between factions in the armed forces, Mengistu, then
an army major, came to power and set up a government that is the
Soviet Union's strongest ally in Africa.
   Mengistu inherited the northern rebellions. Recently, his forces
have been all but forced out of Eritrea and Tigre in a series of
humiliating defeats at the hands of the separatist Eritrean
People's Liberation Front and the Tigrean People's Liberation
Front, which wants more autonomy.

   Ousted Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
has been placed back on a respirator and was listed in critical
condition today because of a recurrence of pneumonia, hospital
officials said.
   Marcos, 71, has been at St. Francis Medical Center since Jan. 15
with respiratory, heart and kidney ailments.
   He had been listed in guarded condition and was in a unit for
heart patients before his relapse prompted his return to intensive
care on Monday, hospital officials said.
   He also was reattached to a respirator, the hospital said in a
statement Tuesday night.
   ``It's an episodic thing. He has pneumonia and his condition has
been downgraded,'' said Eugene Tiwanak, assistant hospital
administrator.
   In April, doctors said Marcos was chronically ill and unlikely
to recover.
   ``Mrs. Marcos is of course very worried, but managing to hold
her composure,'' said Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, are under U.S. indictment on
charges they plundered more than $100 million from the Philippine
government and used the money to buy artworks and real estate.
   Because of his illness, Marcos has been separated from the case.
   The Marcoses have lived here since he was overthrown in a
popular revolt in February 1986.

   Tropical storm Brenda swept across
the central Philippines today with winds up to 63 mph, killing at
least two people, forcing hundreds from their homes and disrupting
air service.
   The two victims died when their motor launch, the Albert,
capsized Tuesday in stormy seas 200 miles east of Manila. Coast
guard Lt. Anacleto Limbo said the two bodies were recovered today
and 13 passengers were missing.
   Limbo said the coast guard also received a distress signal from
a cargo vessel, the Zambales, which reported it was sinking off
Mindoro island.
   He said the message gave no word on the number of crew members,
and it was unclear if the vessel actually sank. Limbo said the
search was hampered because coast guard vessels had taken shelter
from the storm.
   Another boat, the 4.6-ton Corazon II, sank while berthed at the
Tabaco town pier in Albay province. There were no reports of
casualties in the incident.
   Brenda came ashore early today on Samar Island and passed about
10 miles south of the capital after sunset.
   The Manila weather bureau said that at 10 p.m. Brenda was
spotted over the Manila Bay on the way out to the South China Sea.
   Brenda, which was packing 63 mph winds as it neared Manila,
weakened slightly to 59 mph and was moving west northwest at 12 mph.
   There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties on land.
But the storm knocked out communications to rural areas, disrupted
electric power and caused huge traffic jams on Manila's flooded
streets.
   Philippine Airlines canceled 50 domestic flights and the coast
guard prevented at least six ships from leaving the port of Manila.
   Airport officials said a Cathay Pacific flight returned to Hong
Kong after trying unsuccessfully to land in Manila three times.
Philippine Air Lines flights from Singapore, Tokyo and Sydney,
Australia, were diverted to Cebu, 350 miles southeast of the
capital.
   As the storm approached, the officials expanded storm warnings
to cover all of Luzon island. The weather bureau warned residents
of coastal areas to watch for giant waves or storm surges. A
weather bulletin also warned of possible flooding in low areas.
   Storm warnings had also been raised over much of the central
Viasayas islands, but there were no immediate reports of casualties
or damage from either Samar or Masbate.
   The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company said circuits to
the effected areas were down. Damage and casualty reports from
storms often take days or weeks to reach Manila because of poor
communications.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation.
   May 10
   The Daily Journal, Elizabeth, N.J., on stricter public housing
rules:
   Jack Kemp, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, ... issued new _ and controversial _ federal leases
that allow the swift eviction of drug users and sellers from public
housing.
   Opponents claim the new leases will be no more effective than
present rules ... (and) will create a new wave of homeless.
   For instance, under the rules, an entire family could be evicted
if a 14-year-old son were arrested for smoking marijuana.
   However, Kemp's accelerated eviction process protects ...
against arbitrary or unfair removal by providing a state court
hearing.
   No one claims the new rules are a panacea for this horrible
social problem. But they are intended to protect people who live in
public housing from being condemned to lives made miserable by the
drug trade.

   The Journal-Bulletin, Providence, R.I., on Panama:
   General Noriega wasted litle time (last) week in protecting his
bad name.
   After massive and ill-disguised efforts to steal (the previous)
weekend's election, ... his puppet government declared the outcome
void. And his personal shock troops, who call themselves the
Dignity Battalion, embarked on a rampage, choosing their victims
with extraordinary care.
   President Bush is (sending) additional troops to the Canal Zone,
ostensibly to protect American lives and interests. ...
   Our worry is about subsequent steps: If the United States has no
intention of taking military action against the Noriega regime ...
then a show of force may be very easily transformed into a
demonstration of weakness.
   Let us hear ... from President Arias of Costa Rica, winner of
the 1987 Nobel Prize for Peace. ...
   Arias is happy to dispense advice about United States policy
toward Nicaragua; we would be interested to know his reaction to
these remarkable events taking place just next door.

   The Pittsburgh Press on Janos Kadar:
   If one man can be a traitor to and benefactor of his people,
that figure is Hungary's former Communist Party chief Janos Kadar,
who is 76, sick and senile and was kicked out of his last powerless
post last week.
   Kadar was a key minister in the government of Prime Minister
Imre Nagy, a patriot who led a popular uprising against the Soviet
Union in 1956. ...
   (Kadar) then presided over the execution of Nagy and other
former colleagues, having their bodies thrown in an unmarked mass
grave. ...
   Nagy's body was exhumed in March and will be given a proper
burial. Someday, when Hungary is truly independent, a monument will
be erected in his honor.
   Perhaps something should also mark the memory of Janos Kadar,
whose twisted way helped lead to a better Hungary.
   Perhaps half a statue.

   Vicksburg (Miss.) Evening Post on the Soviet Central Committee:
   Mikhail Gorbachev's bloodless purge of the ``dead souls'' on the
Soviet Central Committee is no surprise. Many of the 110 members
who were dropped had already been removed from their other high
party posts.
   The surprise was the remarkable candor of Gorbachev's public
speeches. He did not attempt to hide his anger and frustration over
the failure of his economic reforms: ``The state's financial
position is grave.''
   Nor was Gorbachev slow in assigning blame: ``Wherever personnel
changes have become necessary ... they must be carried out without
the slighest hesitation.''
   This threat to purge other party and government officials who
sabotage reforms will have to be liberally carried out. In a way,
this latest housecleaning of conservatives is the last of the easy
purges. ...
   The logical weapons for Gorbachev _ public outrage against local
bosses and exposure in the news media of corrupt malingerers _
could prove effective. The real trick for the Soviet leader is to
find enough local officials who will jump on the reform wagon to
advance their own careers. As in capitalism, Gorbachev must harness
enlightended self-interest and greed.

   Los Angeles Herald-Examiner on Bush's crime fight plan:
   Mr. Kinder and Gentler just got tougher. Unfortunately, the
president's anti-crime package ... isn't particularly smarter.
   The half-step George Bush took on the assault-gun ban _ halting
the import of the weapons, but allowing the manufacture of those
instruments of death made in the U. S. of A. _ is drawing
attention. But what it deserves is close scrutiny, and revision.
His other proposals aren't much better.
   _ He called for building some 26,000 more jail cells. ... (But)
most prison experts believe ... the new cells would still be
inadequate to hold the overflow of criminals in America's federal
prisons. ...
   _ Bush also proposed an expansion of the number of federal
crimes punishable by death. We support the concept of capital
punishment, but that penalty necessarily carries with it
significant judicial oversight and review. Yet, the president seeks
no new funding to increase federal judgeships.
   _ New crime fighting positions would be created, including 1,600
more federal prosecutors. ... But, again, when this new legal power
begins making its busts, where will the convicted criminals be
locked up? ...
   The nation may not be able to afford the entire ($1.6 billion)
package, but he can still do better. For instance, the assault-gun
import ban, linked with the proposed prohibition against 20-bullet
clips for semiautomatics, must be expanded to include the
American-made arms as well. That's the kind of cost-free idea that
could prove to be priceless in the fight against crime.

   The Journal, New Ulm, Minn., on a proposed federal tax on
employee benefits:
   The most notorious scheme to emerge from Washington at the
moment is a federal proposal to enact a tax on employee benefits.
   It's an outrageous idea that goes contrary to more than four
decades of congressional action meant to spur the increase of
private benefit plans, which greatly reduce the pressure on
government and publicly funded health care services.
   The proposal, which would include a tax on employee group health
insurance and employee group life insurance, would hurt millions of
Americans.
   If employee benefits are made subject to taxation, we can be
certain that the pressure will mount for a national health service,
something that should be avoided at all cost.
   The proposed taxation would become a particular burden on older
workers. And single women in the work force, many of them with
dependents, would be severely affected.

   Anderson (S.C.) Independent-Mail on Oliver North's trial:
   Considering the undisputed facts in the Oliver North case, it
seems to us the jury came in with the best outcome that North and
his lawyers had any reasonable right to expect.
   North admitted to doing things that were technically in
violation of law. For the jury to have averted its eyes to these
transgressions of law would have been for them to have said it was
all right to ignore laws that get in the way of the president
carrying out his policies.
   Acquitting North on all charges would have had enormous
Constitutional implications that the president and his men are
above some, if not all, laws. The jury, quite sensibly in our
opinion, refused to accept such a Constitutional concept.
   The fact that the North jury convicted on some charges and not
on others shows that a lot of weighing and balancing went on in
that jury room. There was plausible evidence for convicting North
on some charges on which he was acquitted. That suggests the jury
felt, as many of us do, a kind of sympathy for North as a decent,
if over-zealous, human being with a very narrow sense of duty. ...
   While we have no desire to see Oliver North treated like a
common criminal, we are convinced the jury was right to convict him
on at least some of the charges. By their attention to their duty
as citizens, the Americans who were members of the North jury
demonstrated that the capacity for democratic self-governemnt is
alive and well in this country.
   The North jury showed that even among people who pay little
attention to headline news on a day-to-day basis, there is a strong
instinct for the fundamental spirit of our enduring Constitution.

   Casa Grande (Ariz.) Dispatch on Panama:
   President Bush is treading a fine line by sending nearly 2,000
combat troops to Panama. The United States needs to protect
Americans living in that nation and put pressure on the dictator,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, without antagonizing other Latin
American nations and rallying support for Noriega.
   Noriega suspended the recent presidential election in which his
hand-picked candidate ostensibly was winning. But American
observers said that the opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara,
actually won and the vote fraud that was taking place was all too
obvious, thus causing Noriega to call off the farce. The American
observers included former presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford
and U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
   The situation worsened when Noriega-backed thugs beat Endara
last week. U.S. bases have been opened as a haven to Noriega
opponents and American dependents.
   The United States has a great interest in what happens in Panama
because of the need to maintain security for the Panama Canal,
scheduled to be turned over to Panama by the end of this century.
Abrogating the treaty giving the canal to Panama could cause
serious problems for American diplomacy.
   Other Latin American nations' taking a stand against Noriega may
help in his removal. Bush is correct in taking action to protect
lives and trying to facilitate Noriega's removal from Panama. As
with the case of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, one important
step is finding a place for Noriega to go. And with his record of
alleged drug trafficking, that isn't easy.

   The Bulletin, Bend, Ore., on the savings and loans bailout:
   Congress still is wrestling with the specifics of how the
government is going to bail out the failed savings and loans, but
it is obvious that the whole mess is going to land in the laps of
American taxpayers.
   Grit your teeth, because here's what you'll pay for: the
expensive promotions and lavish parties sponsored by now-defunct
S&amp;Ls; the losses suffered by depositors who eagerly opened accounts
at high interest rates the S&amp;Ls could not afford; the thousands of
unwise building projects that cost too much and went broke; and the
failed mortgages that belonged to property speculators who
defaulted when the Texas oil boom went bust.
   The latest estimates place the cost of the bailout at something
between $157-$187 billion. ... The (Baltimore) Evening Sun recently
estimated that the cost is expected to come to about $600 for every
man, woman and child in America over the next 30 years.
   That's $2,400 for a typical family of four _ a huge price to
exact from innocent taxpayers to pay for bad management, sleazy
financial deals and the government's inability to adequately
regulate this industry.

   The Morning News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on Soviet defense
motives:
   Imagine that U.S. defense policies were decided the way Soviet
policies are: without public debate, congressional oversight or
pesky critics.
   Were that the case, the administration could turn every arms
economy into a propaganda coup. The 1990 defense budget, for
example, proposes to retire naval warships, pare back
missile-defense reseach, cut troop strength and delay the Stealth
bomber program.
   Everyone knows this is being done to save money. But if this
were a closed society, the expedience of the cutbacks wouldn't be
so obvious. The president could stand up in some international
forum and dramatically present all these reductions as a grand
sacrifice for world peace.
   That's why it's best to hold the applause on Mikhail Gorbachev's
peace initiatives, including his latest offer to unilaterally
withdraw 500 tactical nuclear warheads from Europe. As generous as
these gestures may appear, chances are they are prompted by
economic necessity or shrewd political calculation. ...
   Gorbachev's more serious overtures should be taken more
seriously, of course. His proposal for reducing and equalizing
conventional forces on both sides of the Iron Curtain is promising.
It addresses the fundamental question: Is the Soviet Union willing
to demilitarize its economy and permanently abandon the theat of
force?
   When that question is answered, there'll be no need for
guess-work about the real agenda of the Kremlin.

   Wausau (Wis.) Daily Herald on the need for small businesses:
   The salaries are smaller, the employee list shorter, and the
bottom lines don't make CNN's business report, but running a small
business has its own kind of perks.
   Does the chief executive officer of Ford know every employee
personally and does he know when an employee has a baby or a parent
dies? No, but owners of small businesses often do. ...
   Family members care for each other and notice when someone's
feeling under the weather. Those are personal benefits that don't
come in the form of a paychceck, but keep people working for the
same company for a quarter-century or more.
   It's the small businesses _ all 17 million of them _ that hold
together the nation's economy and account for two of every three
new jobs.
   From the retail shop owner to the local clinic workers to the
plumber down the street, small-business men and women are working
hard to better their lives and the lives of their families.
   Multiply that type of dedication by 17 million, and you've
calculated the lifeblood of our economy.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on the Hatch Act:
   For the second time in two years, the House of Representatives
has passed a bill wiping out safeguards against the politicization
of the federal work force. The 1987 bill was killed in the Senate;
this time the country may not be so lucky.
   Under threat is the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from
partisan political activism.
   Does the Hatch Act infringe (on) the rights of federal workers
to freedom of speech? The Supreme Court has repeatedly said ``No'';
a 1973 ruling cited ``the judgment of history ... that federal
service should depend on meritorious performance rather than
political service.''
   Hatch's intent is clearly not to bully civil servants, but to
shield them from bullying by their superiors _ and by their
increasingly powerful union leaders.
   Even more important, the Hatch Act protects the general public.
If you need to talk with a federal employee about your tax bill or
Social Security check, you want to be confident that your political
activities will not influence his decision.
   Assistant Attorney General Thomas Boyd warns that if the new
assault on Hatch succeeds, ``the nonpartisan enforcement of federal
law ... would certainly be threatened and could be extinguished.''
President Bush should use his heavy artillery _ including his veto
power if necessary _ to prevent that.

   Activists on both sides of the abortion
debate are giving too much significance to a U.S. Supreme Court
justice's order blocking a 15-year-old girl's abortion, says a
lawyer who helped draft the appeal.
   Justice Anthony Kennedy decided Tuesday to, in effect, reinstate
a Florida law that requires women under 18 to obtain the consent of
their parents or a judge before they can get an abortion although a
state appeals court had ruled it unconstitutional.
   His order did not address any legal or constitutional issues,
but merely put off further consideration of the matter until the
full court's scheduled Thursday conference.
   Attorney Hunter Limbaugh said the only reason Kennedy was asked
for the order was because he is assigned to the 11th U.S. Judicial
Circuit which includes Florida.
   ``It isn't because we went justice shopping or that he has made
a decision on the Missouri case,'' said Limbaugh, referring to
another abortion case pending before the high court.
   The high court could use the Missouri case to change its Roe vs.
Wade ruling that in 1973 upheld the right of women to have
abortions.
   Kennedy and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, both relative newcomers
to the court whose views on abortion reman widely unknown, are
considered to be the swing votes in Missouri's challenge to the Roe
vs. Wade decision.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Florida Supreme Court had suspended a state
law requiring minors to have a parent's or judge's consent to an
abortion until the court rules on the law's constitutionality in
September.
   Limbaugh, of Leesburg, assisted lawyer Richard Boyleston, from
Tavares, who was appointed to represent the fetus of the
15-year-old central Florida girl who challenged the state's consent
law. The teen-ager, identified in court documents as T.W. of Lake
County, is 12 weeks pregnant.
   ``I feel optimistic, but of course I'm devastated for my client
because hours and days are important right now,'' said the girl's
attorney, Jerri Blair of Leesburg, who was preparing to file a
response to Kennedy's order.
   Some activists had argued that Kennedy's first order on an
abortion issue sent a strong signal of his stance on abortions.
   ``Before this he was a totally blank slate,'' said attorney
Frank Susman, who represents an Reproductive Health Services of St.
Louis, the abortion clinic defending against Missouri's challenge
of Roe vs. Wade.
   Other pro-choice supporters said they had expected Kennedy to
vote against abortion rights.
   ``The National Organization for Women has never doubted that
Justice Kennedy is hostile to the constitutional concept of the
right to abortion, and his action today bears out that
evaluation,'' said NOW President Molly Yard.
   ``We are appalled that Justice Kennedy would stay the decision
of the Florida Supreme Court to allow the teen-ager in question to
obtain an abortion without parental consent.
   ``With this teen-ager already 12 weeks pregnant, each passing
day has the potential of making an abortion more difficult and
possibly dangerous, if not impossible, for the young woman whose
life has become a judicial football.''
   Anti-abortion activists applauded Kennedy's action.
   ``This shows that, unlike some other justices, Kennedy takes
parental rights seriously,'' said Clarke Forsythe, general counsel
of Americans United for Life in Chicago.
   ``We're elated,'' said Jean Doyle, executive director of the
Florida Right to Life in Orlando. ``I think it's an indication that
the court has an interest in Florida's young people. It's a good,
healthy sign as far as I'm concerned.''
   Lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union's headquarters in
New York City said the high court's intervention in the Florida
case could have nationwide implications if the justices decide to
take another look at whether a fetus has legal rights.
   The high court decided in Roe vs. Wade that a fetus doesn't have
the same constitutional rights as a newborn.
   ``There was no basis for appointing a legal guardian for an
11-week-old fetus,'' said Lynn Paltrow of the ACLU's Reproductive
Freedom Project. ``It could have a far-reaching trend that every
pregnant woman might need a guardian for her fetus.''
   Paltrow was referring to Richard Boylston, an attorney appointed
by a Lake County circuit judge after the girl made her request May
2.
   Boylston was the attorney who asked Kennedy for an emergency
stay, fearing that the girl might get an abortion immediately after
the state Supreme Court's decision Tuesday allowing the girl and
other minors to obtain abortions without consent from parents or a
judge.
   Parental consent laws in Ohio and Minnesota also are awaiting
action by the Supreme Court.
   Florida is among 14 states with consent laws, but two are
unenforced and three have been blocked by courts, said Kathryn
Kolbert, an ACLU lawyer in New York.
   In 12 other states, Ms. Kolbert said, parents only have to be
notified about the abortion, but that is not enforced in four
states and courts have blocked the laws in five other states.

   Talks to expand air links between the United States
and Japan failed after Tokyo halved a proposal Washington had found
inadequate five months ago, a U.S. negotiator said today.
   ``We were taken by surprise,'' said the negotiator, who
requested anonymity.
   Talks were scheduled to resume in July, according to a Japanese
Transport Ministry spokesman.
   U.S. and Japanese airlines want to expand service on the
lucrative and busy passenger and cargo air routes.
   Seven million passengers traveled between the two countries in
1988 _ a 25 percent increase over the previous year _ and about a
quarter of all U.S.-Japan trade in goods moves by air, the official
said.
   In December, Washington proposed 16 new services for Japanese
carriers and 13 new services for U.S. carriers, while Japan
countered with 10 new lines for Japanese carriers and six for U.S.
carriers.
   The United States had hoped the two countries would reach a
compromise, the official said. But the new Japanese proposal was
for five new Japanese services and three new U.S. services, he said.
   Japanese negotiators reportedly said its already crowded
airports cannot accommodate much expansion.
   But the official said Japanese airlines have opposed expanding
U.S. air services and the government wants to protect its carriers
from competition.

   Congressional leaders and anti-apartheid
activists from South Africa urged the Bush administration today to
mount an international campaign to pressure the South African
government to grant full political rights to its black majority.
   Speaking in the ornate Senate Caucus Room, Nobel Peace Prize
laureate the Rev. Desmond Tutu called on the Bush administration to
take the ``moral leadership'' and tighten economic pressures on
South Africa.
   ``Your intervention is critical. Apartheid is destroying our
land and our people. Help us. Please help us,'' Tutu told the
gathering of 80 lawmakers, governors, academics and businessmen.
   Tutu and two other activists, the Rev. Allan Boesak and Beyers
Naude, issued a proposal in which they urged the United States to
adopt to prompt the South African government to negotiate.
   The plan includes an immediate lifting of the state of emergency
imposed by the government, the release of all political prisoners
and recognition of the banned African National Congress.
   Naude, a white Afrikaner, said the U.S. administration should
use the opportunity created by South Africa's severe economic
hardships to tighten the screws of trade sanctions on South Africa.
Without such measures, he said, the government will never grant
political rights to the 28 million black South Africans.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., saying that the fight against
apartheid has become ``the greatest human rights struggle of our
time,'' urged the Bush administration to work together with
Congress on a new strategy toward South Africa.
   ``Kinder and gentler does not mean apartheid. Now is the time to
move ahead, not stand in place,'' he said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he was
encouraged by the openness of the Bush administration as signaled
by the presence of Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen at the
gathering. Mitchell said Congress and the administration ``agree
upon the end _ abolition of apartheid. We must now reach agreement
on the means.''
   The Reagan administration fought and lost a bitter battle with
Congress in 1986 over sanctions on South Africa.
   Kennedy said that ``instead of rushing to refight old battles,
we intend to seek new possibilities'' for cooperating with the
administration in U.S. policy toward South Africa.
   National Party leader F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to become
South Africa's next leader once President P.W. Botha retires in
September, has called for a new political system in his country,
although he rejects a one-person, one-vote system espoused by
anti-apartheid groups.
   There has been speculation de Klerk may come to the United
States for a visit later this year.
   State Department officials say the administration has decided to
broaden its contacts with South African leaders across the
political spectrum and that a de Klerk visit is possible.
   The proposals of the anti-apartheid leadership prompted
publication Tuesday of a Gallup survey showing most South Africans
oppose international economic sanctions because they believe the
sanctions lead to joblessness rather than political change.
   Only one in six blacks said sanctions are a good idea because
they would force the government to abolish apartheid. Six of 10
blacks said they would oppose sanctions even if these led the
government to resign within five years.
   The survey of 2,192 people _ 1,400 blacks, 392 whites and 400 of
mixed race and Asian origin _ was commissioned by the South African
Chamber of Mines, representing the country's mining industry.
   Of those polled, 82 percent of the blacks and 95 percent of the
whites rejected foreign sanctions, with most saying they would lead
to higher unemployment.
   Congress imposed limited sanctions on South Africa in 1986,
overriding a veto by then-President Reagan, in an effort to force
the government to grant political rights to the black majority.
   The survey, conducted between March 11 and May 8, had a 4
percent margin of error. Neil Upmeyer, research director for
Gallup, said that to ensure credibility of the responses,
interviews were conducted away from the work place by interviewers
who were of the same race as the respondent.
   In the survey, 59 percent of the blacks and 51 percent of the
whites, and 58 percent of all respondents, said American companies
in South Africa can help make the government moderate its racial
policies.
   Of those polled, 77 percent of blacks and 50 percent of whites
said ending American business operations would seriously hurt the
South African economy.

<TEXT>
   Many factories, stores and street
stands were open today, though commuter traffic was lighter than
normal, as an opposition general strike to protest the voiding of
the May 7 election got under way.
   ``Some factories are opening, and some aren't. In those that
open some will come to work and some will support the strike,''
said a man standing outside a poultry and egg processing plant in
an industrial area.
   Some merchants said they were afraid to observe the strike. The
government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega declared the strike
illegal because it has political, rather than economic, motives and
said order will be guaranteed.
   Panamanian military trucks dropped off patrolmen for their
normal beats, but no soldiers were visible at places they are often
stationed when the government expects trouble.
   The strike was also to protest the brutal beatings by Noriega
supporters of the opposition prsidential candidate and his running
mates.
   The one-day work stoppage coincides with the start of a special
meeting on the Panamanian crisis in Washington. The opposition
wants the Organization of American States foreign ministers to
recognize its victory in the elections.
   The government and the opposition _ which international
observers say won the election _ said they were sending
representatives to the meeting.
   As rush hour began in Panama City, traffic appeared lighter than
usual and there were no lines at many bus stops. Some normally
crowded buses ran almost empty. But gasoline stations were open, as
were many restaurants and markets. Street vendors sold their wares.
   A spokeswoman for the state-run oil company said many office
workers stayed home but that the company's trans-Isthmian oil
pipeline was operating normally.
   ``One is afraid of the consequences,'' said a woman who opened
her downtown office supply store. She said two of her four workers
did not report for work.
   The owner of a furniture said he feared reprisals and added that
business was so bad that ``to close down again would be fatal.''
   To frustrate the strike, the government set today instead of
Monday as a payday, and government-controlled union leaders
condemned the strike.
   The government began continuous jamming of U.S. Armed Forces
television Tuesday. That meant the only television station
available was one controlled by the government. Normally, the
government only jams news programming.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. government prepared to evacuate another
planeload of military personnel and dependents.
   On Tuesday, a jumbo jet chartered by the U.S. Air Force
evacuated 238 U.S. citizens in the first of many flights to
evacuate Americans who want to leave.
   U.S. Air Force Maj. Joan Ferguson said some of those aboard the
flight were vacating housing for people living off base who
President Bush had ordered to move onto military installations for
security reasons.
   The United States had been trying to oust Noriega for more than
a year and Bush last week ordered 1,900 reinforcements into the
country to beef up the 10,000-strong U.S. force already stationed
in Panama.
   In February 1988, Noriega was indicted on federal
drug-trafficking charges in Florida. The head of Panama's
15,000-member Defense Forces, he formerly was a close U.S. ally in
the region.
   Noriega denies the drug charges and says they are part of a ploy
to get rid of him in favor of someone who might abrogate the
treaties that cede U.S. control of the Panama Canal at the end of
the century.
   The opposition asked businesses to close today and people to
stay in their homes until noon, when they were to emerge for
protests ``by any imaginable means.''
   A restaurant owner who asked that neither he nor his
establishment be named said he planned to stay open during the
strike.
   ``The situation is too rough,'' he said today.
   The strike is also aimed at keeping pressure on the Organization
of American States.
   The opposition wants the OAS to impose sanctions that would
amount to a political and diplomatic quarantine of Panama if the
government refuses to recognize opposition candidates Guillermo
Endara as president and Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford
as vice presidents.
   The opposition claims it won the vote by a 3-1 margin.
   The government claimed a 2-1 margin for Noriega business
associate Carlos Duque. It said it nullified vote-counting on May
10 because Washington had interfered in the political process by
aiding the opposition. The CIA reportedly contributed $10 million
to the opposition campaign.
   No new election has been scheduled.

   The U.S. Customs Service today announced the
seizure of $1.8 million worth of computers from a smuggling network
described as one of the largest U.S. suppliers of high-technology
equipment to Eastern bloc nations.
   The network purchased sensitive VAX computer systems in the last
two years for illegal shipment to the Eastern bloc, and tens of
millions of dollars worth of high-tech equipment had been shipped
in the past several years, Customs said.
   The 13-month, Miami-based undercover investigation, which
produced four arrests Tuesday and an arrest warrant for a Canadian,
was handled by a Customs operation named ``Miami Exodus Group.''
   Steve Smylie, his wife, Carole Smylie, and Kerry Blalock were
arrested in Houston, and Rick Parish was taken into custody in
Dallas. Warre Wetstein of Toronto was named in the arrest warrant.
   Two Digital Equipment Corp. VAX 8820 computer systems worth $1.8
million were confiscated in Colorado Springs, Colo. The system has
military and civilian applications and can be attached to existing
systems to upgrade them.
   The suspects were accused of using domestic and foreign
companies, brokers and freight forwarders to illegally export
computers, said Customs, which described the network as one of the
largest high-tech smuggling organizations ever investigated by the
agency.

   Aviation officials today were investigating a
possible violation of flight regulations by the commander of the
space shuttle Atlantis after he reportedly flew his jet trainer
within 100 feet vertically of a Pan Am airliner.
   Navy Capt. David M. Walker, was flying a NASA T-38 plane en
route to a White House ceremony honoring the Atlantis astronauts
when the incident, reported by the airliner's pilot as a ``near
midair collision,'' occurred Monday evening outside Washington.
   Near-collision reports generally are filed whenever planes come
within 500 feet of each other and are in danger of colliding.
   The National Transportation Safety Board opened a formal
investigation into the accusation, and the FAA and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration were conducting separate
inquiries, officials said today.
   ``We are looking at a possible pilot deviation,'' FAA spokesman
John Leyden said. He said air traffic controllers reported the
alleged deviation after Walker's plane descended to 7,000 feet _
the same altitude as the airliner _ when it had been instructed to
go to 8,000 feet.
   The FAA spokesman said air traffic controllers reported the
vertical separation between the planes at 100 feet, and
investigators would have to examine recordings of data to determine
exactly how far apart they were at their closest point.
   Leyden said possible enforcement action against a civilian pilot
who deviates from procedures could range from an administrative
letter to action affecting his license, but since Walker is a Navy
pilot any conclusion would likely be referred to the military for
further action.
   The incident occurred at about 6:35 p.m. Monday some five miles
west of Washington Dulles International Airport in the northern
Virginia suburbs, Leyden said.
   Walker, contacted at his hotel room in Washington on Tuesday
night, refused to comment on the report of the near collision.
   ``That's something that I need to probably talk about with the
FAA about, not with the news organizations,'' he said. ``I'm going
to have to get my information from them before I start talking to
you all.''
   NASA spokesman David Garrett said Walker flew the jet to
Washington to attend Tuesday's White House ceremony at which
President Bush honored the shuttle astronauts. Garrett said he had
heard reports of a possible close call involving Walker but had so
far been unable to reach the pilot.
   Leyden explained, ``The pilot (of the NASA craft) was given an
8,000-foot assigned altitude. He was descending below his assigned
altitude of 8,000 feet to 7,000 feet, and that caused him to come
close to a Pan American Airbus 310.''
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon confirmed that the small plane
crossed the path of Pan Am Flight 140, which had just taken off for
Paris. The plane, which has 296 seats, was carrying 166 passengers
and a crew of 10, she said.
   ``It had taken off from Dulles and was at 7,000 feet when it
reported a T-38 aircraft came within what the captain believed to
be approximately 500 feet of the Airbus aircraft,'' said Hanlon.
   ``The pilot did not take any evasive action,'' but immediately
reported the incident to the Dulles Airport tower, said Hanlon.
   Bush honored Walker and his fellow shuttle astronauts, along
with two groups of school children who picked the winning name for
the newest space shuttle.
   Bush told Walker, Ronald Grabe, Norman Thagard, Mark Lee and
Mary Cleave, who returned May 8 from a four-day shuttle mission,
``You've reaffirmed your nation's genius in science and technology
and yet, I think we would all agree, this really is only just the
beginning.''
   The crew on the 29th shuttle flight launched the Magellan space
probe, which will orbit Venus after an 800-million-mile, 15-moth
journey and map the surface of Earth's fog-shrouded sister planet.
   The pupils, from Senatobia Middle School in Senatobia, Miss.,
and Tallulah Falls School in Tallulah Falls, Ga., had each
submitted the name ``Endeavour,'' for the shuttle being built to
replace the Challenger, which exploded after its launch in January
1986.

<TEXT>
   Rudolph W. Giuliani, who gained fame with his
high-profile prosecutions as U.S. attorney in Manhattan, announced
his candidacy for mayor today, promising to fight crime and restore
honest government.
   Giuliani, a Republican, told several hundred cheering supporters
that he was running in the spirit of Fiorello LaGuardia, a
Republican who won the mayoralty in 1933 in a city dominated, then
as now, by Democrats.
   ``He led a fusion movement, a movement forged by people of every
political stripe, to kick out an old, tired and corrupt
administration,'' Giuliani said. He spoke at the Metropolitan
Republican Club in Manhattan, where LaGuardia announced his
candidacy.
   Giuliani suggested that his election in itself would promote
honesty in government, declaring, ``A multiparty system is the most
effective check and balance on corruption in government.''
   ``Corruption in New York must be confronted and confronted
directly,'' he said. ``I am seeking support on one basis and one
basis alone _ that you agree with me that honest, decent, effective
government must be restored.''
   The city's last Republican mayor was John V. Lindsay, elected in
1965.
   Giuliani has made national headlines prosecuting mobsters, Wall
Street cheats and corrupt politicians.
   In the Republican primary Giuliani faces cosmetics heir Ronald
Lauder, who is running as a conservative more in tune with the
city's GOP stalwarts.
   Democratic Mayor Edward I. Koch, a 12-year incumbent, suffers
from lagging popularity and trails in the polls to a fellow
Democrat, Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins.

   Parliament today approved the prime minister's
Palestinian election plan after he defeated a challenge by
right-wing legislators in his Likud bloc who argued the plan could
lead to a Palestinian state.
   The tally was 43 to 15, with 11 abstaining, in a vote of
confidence in the government that was considered a test for the
plan. Fifty-one members of the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament,
were absent for the vote.
   The vote followed a seven-hour debate in the Knesset and a
contentious meeting of Likud legislators.
   The prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir, told Likud opponents of the
plan that pro-PLO activists in the occupied lands would not be
allowed to vote in the elections and insisted Israel would not give
up land to achieve peace.
   Before the vote, Shamir played down opposition by leading
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip who have
called his plan a ploy to cheat them out of a Palestinian state.
   ``From the Arab side, there have been voices of refusal and
rejection of the whole plan,'' Shamir told the Knesset. ``We do not
think these voices are the final word.''
   The plan, approved 20-6 by the Cabinet on Sunday, calls for
Palestinians in the occupied lands to elect representatives to
negotiate an interim autonomy settlement with Israel.
   In Tunisia on Tuesday, the Palestine Liberation Organization
formally rejected Shamir's plan. The PLO executive committee said
it denies the Palestinian's ``legitimate, national rights and
ignores international resolutions...that condemn the appropriation
of another's territory by force.''
   In Israel today, two extreme, right-wing opposition parties,
Tehiya and Moledet, submitted motions of no confidence over the
peace plan.
   Geula Cohen of Tehiya told parliament that Shamir's proposal
would cause violent opposition in Israel similar to the 17-month
Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation.
   ``If you fail to see the writing on the wall, then there will be
an uprising that will force you, Mr. Prime Minister, to bring an
entirely new proposal,'' she said.
   Before his parliament address, Shamir discussed his plan with
Likud legislators. Leading Likud figures oppose the plan, saying it
would pave the way for negotiations with the PLO and the creation
of a Palestinian state.
   ``The initiative states that we shall negotiate with any Arab
who is elected,'' said Likud legislator Pessah Grupper. ``This is
leading toward negotiations with the PLO.''
   Shamir said Palestinians ``involved in PLO activity will not be
able to run in elections or vote.'' It was not immediately clear
whether he also was referring to Palestinians who are sympathetic
to the PLO.
   Regarding a Palestinian state, Shamir said: ``It won't be and it
won't be created. And whoever says this, should his tongue cleave
to the roof of his mouth.''
   Shamir, who repeatedly banged his fist on a table during the
session with Likud, said he received PLO offers daily for direct
negotiations, ``but there is nothing to talk about because they
want a Palestinian state.''
   He said elections would not be held until the Palestinian
uprising has been crushed. Since the rebellion began in December
1987, 479 Palestinians and 21 Israelis have been killed.
   Shamir said Palestinians in east Jerusalem should not be allowed
to participate in the elections but told Likud members the issue
was left open.
   Israel annexed east Jerusalem after capturing it from Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East war. The United States would like to see
participation from Palestinians in the city.

<HEAD>Former Funeral Director Pleads Guilty in Burials Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALLATIN, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former funeral director accused in a
string of improper burials pleaded guilty today to two counts of
grand larceny for burying bodies without caskets or vaults their
families had purchased.
   Bobby Wilks, 53, who pleaded guilty to burying Joseph Roath
without the casket and vault his family had ordered, could be
sentenced up to six years on each count.
   Investigators found the man's body had been wrapped in cardboard
and buried only 3 feet deep. Wilks also pleaded guilty to burying
Ollie Hester without a vault that had been paid for.
   ``Mr. Hester was buried. His son paid $750 for a vault, which
was not received,'' said District Attorney Ray Whitley. ``He later
paid $1,600 for a casket.''
   An investigation later showed that Hester was buried in a
cheaper casket than the family had purchased.
   A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after separate burial
fraud charges against Wilks are settled in neighboring Robertson
County, where he faces a 71-count indictment.
   Wilks operated funeral homes in Milldale and in White House,
small communities about 25 miles north of Nashville, before the
State Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers suspended his
license on Oct. 20.
   His son, Gary, was charged with obtaining money under false
pretenses and larceny by false pretenses in connection with the
burials. Records showed he was not a registered apprentice or
licensed embalmer.
   The investigation into the family's mortuary business began Oct.
7 after a complaint that a Robertson County man was buried without
a vault that had been purchased.
   Authorities opened the grave and verified it had no vault, and
more than 30 bodies were exhumed in the following months at
graveyards in Sumner and Robertson counties in Tennessee, and in
Franklin, Ky.
   In some cases caskets were missing, trash was found buried with
other bodies.

<HEAD>Report Says U.S. to Pay Rent for U.S. Facility for First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has agreed to pay
rent for a U.S. cultural center in South Korea for the first time
in more than 40 years, it was reported Wednesday.
   The Yonhap News Agency quoted a senior Foreign Ministry official
as saying the U.S. agreement to pay rent was ``an important event
in Korea-U.S. relations.''
   Yonhap also quoted Charge d'Affaires Thomas Brooks as saying the
United States will return the cultural center in the central city
of Kwangju to the city and start paying rent on a new office after
a two-year grace period.
   The Kwangju center has been a target of radical student attacks
and U.S. officials closed it temporarily May 10.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jack Sears declined to comment on the
report and said officials were still negotiating a new agreement.
   The U.S. government used the Kwangju center free under a 1948
agreement between the two nations, Yonhap said. It said Seoul also
has decided to ask for rent for the U.S. cultural center in Pusan,
a southern port city.
   Yonhap said the nations would review the 1948 agreement under
which the United States was allowed the continued use of some
facilities free of charge.

<TEXT>
   After two years of negotiations, Turkey
has accepted a U.S. proposal to modernize an American listening
station that monitors Soviet activities, officials said Wednesday.
   The United States would install a new computer to replace an
obsolete one from 1960, and build a ground satellite station for
better communication between the Pirinclik listening station and
the United States, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Inal Batu.
   Turkey approved the proposal a few weeks ago, he said.
   A Turkish official, who spoke on condition he was not
identified, said the Pirinclik station is mainly used for
monitoring Soviet activities in space.
   Batu said the approval stemmed from Turkey's desire ``to have a
good start'' with the Bush administration.
   The spokesman added that the U.S. government, complaining about
the level of noise from nearby Ankara, also wants to move the
Belbasi seismological station to another location and modernize the
Sinop station on the Black Sea.
   Negotiations were continuing on these two projects, he said.
   Under a defense cooperation pact, the United States maintains 12
bases in this NATO-member country.

<HEAD>Talks Cease in Los Angeles Teachers' Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers in the nation's second-largest
school district began the third day of their strike today, with
both sides disputing reports that a new salary package was under
consideration.
   Informal talks between Los Angeles Unified School District
officials and union leaders ceased, and union President Wayne
Johnson said today he was mystified by the lack of communication.
   ``I am less hopeful today than I was yesterday,'' Johnson said.
   Both sides awaited the release of a fact-finding report later
today. The state fact-finder began investigating the dispute in
March, when talks reached an impasse in the 16-month contract
negotiation.
   Diana Munatones, a district spokeswoman, said the report would
serve as a focal point for both sides to return to the bargaining
table.
   The seven-member school board met in executive session for four
hours Tuesday but there were no breakthroughs.
   School Board President Roberta Weintraub said they also awaited
details of Gov. George Deukmejian's revised state budget, to be
released Thursday, to determine if additional state funding will be
available for teacher salaries.
   ``This board again finds itself in the same dilemma that they
have continuously been in, and that is that until they get some
better picture of exactly what the dollars are ... then we can make
the better decisions than we've been able to make up until now,''
Ms. Weintraub said.
   Teachers are demanding a 21 percent pay increase in two years.
They also want relief from unpaid duties such as playground patrol,
and greater control in choosing curriculum and how money is spent.
   The district most recently offered a 21.5 percent pay increase
over three years. It also has offered to set up councils at
individual schools so that teachers would have greater input in
setting curriculum.
   The union represents about 22,000 teachers, counselors, nurses
and librarians. Striking teachers account for almost two-thirds of
the district's 32,000-member workforce.

   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. today
ordered the postponement of an oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf
of Alaska and the Cook Inlet, pending further study of the damage
caused by the spill of the tanker Exxon Valdez.
   Lujan, scheduled to make the announcement in San Francisco, said
in a prepared text that because the proposed sale ``is near an area
directly affected by the spill in Prince William Sound, I have
asked the Minerals Management Service to delay preparation of an
environmental impact statement until more is known about the impact
of the spill.''
   The environmental study was originally scheduled for completion
in September of this year, with the leasing sale scheduled for
August of 1990. The proposed drilling area, known as Lease Sale
114, encompasses about 16.7 million acres located between 3 and 400
miles offshore in the Gulf of Alaska and between 3 and 38 miles
offshore in Cook Inlet.
   Minerals Management Service spokesman Tom Derocco said that if
Lujan decides next year to proceed with issuance of the
environmental impact statement, the issue would first be reopened
for public comment.
   Lujan's statement said, ``In particular, we will be working
closely with the governor and local communities to ensure that new
issues arising from changed circumstances in the region are
identified before we proceed.''

   A teen-ager coming home late from a

believe him.
   An alligator had given him a flat.
   Johnny Collins, 18, of Dickinson was returning about 2 a.m.
Sunday when he spotted the gator in the road. He stopped about four
feet away and beeped his horn to get it to move. The animal instead
turned and bit a tire until it exploded.
   ``It did a pretty good number on it, that's for sure,'' said
police Officer Bobby Epperly. ``You wouldn't have wanted that thing
to get hold of your leg.''
   The gator also took a chunk out of the bumper.
   Collins had backed up to change the flat when Epperly arrived.
The alligator, said the officer, returned to its spot in the middle
of the road.
   ``The bad thing was, the young man said his father was not going
to believe him that his car was attacked by an alligator,'' Epperly
said.
   But John Collins, the teen-ager's father, said, ``He's always
been truthful with me. I just told him he better get a (police)
report for his insurance.''
   Game wardens found the gator was injured and were forced to kill
it.

   The number of people employed by the nation's
cities is on the rise again, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday.
   Cities employed 2,541,000 people as of October 1987, the Bureau
said. That's 47,000 more than a year earlier and just 20,000
workers short of the all-time high in October 1980.
   The increase in 1987 _ the most recent figure available _
reflects hiring to provide services to growing city populations,
said Alan V. Stevens, head of the governments division of the
bureau's employment statistics branch.
   After peaking in 1980, city employment dropped sharply early in
this decade after cancellation of the Comprehensive Employment
Training Act, which provided federal money for governments to hire
and train workers. A weak economy at that time also held down
municipal hiring, Stevens said.
   More recently, he said, cities have responded to improving
economic conditions and the needs of the times by increasing their
workforces.
   For example, while overall municipal employees were up 1.9
percent between 1986 and 1987, city-employed corrections officers
increaseed 7.3 percent to 27,295.
   Corrections, Stevens noted, is a fast-rising job category for
states, counties and other governments also, with the spreading
drug problem and an increasing emphasis on jailing criminals.
   Judicial and legal employees of cities also increased sharply,
rising 11.9 percent to 38,609.
   The number of city-employed police officers, however, was up
only 1.7 percent to 312,123, the report showed.
   Overall, city governments had 148.2 workers per 10,000 residents
as of October 1987.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged a
negotiated settlement of China's internal turmoil on Wednesday and
said he has met with some of the students leading the huge rallies
for democracy.
   But the Soviet leader refused to take sides in the pro-democracy
demonstrations that have caused major disruptions in his historic
trip.
   The unrest rippling across the country reached a peak Wednesday
when more than 1 million people surged through Beijing's streets to
demand reform. Because of the crowds, officials moved Gorbachev's
news conference to the guest house where he is staying.
   Gorbachev told reporters he had seen the students who launched
the mass action and had talked to some of them, but he did not
elaborate.
   Gorbachev, who came to China to normalize relations after a
30-year rift, said it was not for him to judge who was right in the
dispute.
   ``I wouldn't take upon myself the responsibility or the role to
pass judgment, and I wouldn't seek to assess what is going on here
in this country,'' he said. ``I believe this is for the Chinese to
do and for the Chinese party.''
   But the Kremlin chief observed ``that a difficult, painful but
political dialogue is going on between the leadership, the youth
and the public concerning these events, and it seems to me that we
should welcome that fact.''
   ``I would only wish that solutions will be found in the process
of negotiation,'' Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev, who was sent a petition signed by 6,000 students,
made a point of noting that he received ``a very warm letter'' from
students that endorsed his reforms in the Soviet Union. ``I value
their position and appreciate it,'' he said.
   Asked what he would do if similar demonstrations occurred in
Moscow, Gorbachev said he would negotiate.
   ``If problems of a similar nature occurred in the Soviet Union,
we would discuss those problems within the political process, in a
spirit of democracy and glasnost,'' he said.
   Several events planned for Gorbachev were canceled or
rescheduled to avoid the huge crowds. On Wednesday, Gorbachev and
his wife, Raisa, were prevented from touring the Forbidden City
just off Tiananmen Square, the sprawling plaza at the center of the
demonstrations.
   Gorbachev said he ``got a little emotional'' from the warmth of
young people he met during a visit to the Great Wall on Wednesday.
``But I'm human.''

   A Somalia Airlines jetliner skidded off
the runway during takeoff Wednesday from Nairobi, but only one
minor injury was reported, police said.
   The Boeing 707, carrying 69 people on a flight to Somalia's
capital of Mogadishu, apparently lost power and skidded in the mud
about 1,000 feet beyond the runway, according to a police officer
who spoke on condition of anonymity.

been for the rain earlier in the day that made the ground soggy. A

<HEAD>Lawmaker Hits White House Reaction to Gorbachev Offers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee chastised the White House today for making belittling
statements about Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and accused
administration officials of lacking ``vision'' in meeting the
Soviet leader's arms control challenges.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., alluded to statements made Tuesday by
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who said the administration
of ``leery'' of Gorbachev's promise to halt military aid to
Nicaragua. Fitzwater also accused Gorbachev of throwing out arms
control proposals like a ``drugstore cowboy'' in the effort to win
attention.
   ``I don't think you ought to run down the Gorbachev proposals. I
don't think the kind of statements Marlin Fitzwater is making are
helpful,'' Aspin told two administration officials at a hearing by
his committee.
   The administration contends that many of Gorbachev's
initiatives, such as his most recent offering to get rid of 500
short-range nuclear weapons, are designed to glean publicity and
are not actually substantial when viewed against the overwhelming
superiority in Warsaw Pact forces in Europe.
   But Aspin argued that the administration was being outflanked by
the Soviet leader's ability to win the public relations war,
particularly among the U.S. allies in Western Europe.
   Aspin and several other Democrats complained to Paul Wolfowitz,
undersecretary of defense for policy, and Reginald Bartholomew,
undersecretary of state for security assistance, that the
administration is losing that fight because it has not responded
swiftly enough to Gorbachev's various arms control proposals, nor
with enough imagination.
   Wolfowitz and Bartholomew countered that the administration was
being cautious in areas where they deemed it was necessary, and had
put forward a serious and far-reaching proposals to trim the
conventional forces in Europe, which the Soviets are now just
coming around to meet.
   But Aspin argued that even though the administration's position
might find agreement among diplomats and the military, it wasn't
winning in the political arena.
   ``You can't beat something with nothing in politics,'' he
complained. ``You have to give me a better world I can point to.
... You've got to have some vision out there _ and it just ain't
there.''

   A consumers group announced Wednesday a
national campaign to investigate alleged abuses of child-labor laws
and to pressure governments to improve enforcement of the standards.
   The National Consumers League also said it would seek to
determine the impact of increased employment among teen-agers on
education and family and personal relationships.
   ``From the sweatshops in New York to the fast food restaurants
in California, more and more young people are working _ and often
illegally,'' said Linda Golodner, the league's executive director.
   Ms. Golodner said the federal Labor Department's Wage and Hour
Division is woefully understaffed, with just 985 compliance
officers whose duties including monitoring labor laws.
   In most states, enforcement staffs are so small they cannot
conduct investigations, only investigate complaints and often are
discouraged from alleging violations unless there are repeat
offenses, she said.
   Ms. Golodner cited a recent Massachusetts study that found a 614
percent increase in child labor violations from 1983 to 1987 and a
New York report released last week that showed a 9.5 percent
increase in violations statewide from 1987 to 1988, with a reported
487 percent increase in violations in New York City, primarily in
the garment industry.
   ``Our goal is to gather information and statistics on child
labor in this country and recommend change in public policy,
regulation and legislation,'' Ms. Golodner said.
   She said the league would work with labor organizations, other
public interest groups and federal and state officials. Results of
the review are to be presented at a symposium in May 1990.

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today
endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F.
Secchia as ambassador to Italy, but the panel's chairman said he
feared Secchia might ``embarrass the United States'' because of his
``penchant for making gross remarks.''
   The committee's vote was 13-0 in favor of Secchia, a former
Republican national committeeman for Michigan and lumber industry
executive.
   The chairman, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., voted ``present,'' meaning they took no
position.
   Pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper accounts
``containing the distasteful specifics of Mr. Secchia's remarks.''
   At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Secchia pledged
to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful
language than he had been in his different role as a political
organizer and enthusiast.
   But Pell said he was unpersuaded.
   ``Tact and careful speech are hallmarks of successful
diplomats,'' Pell said. ``Mr. Secchia has demonstrated that he
would bring opposite qualities to the position of ambassador to
Italy.''
   ``Italian friends of mine telephoned me from Rome, aghast at the
prospect of having Mr. Secchia represent the United States in their
country,'' the chairman said.
   ``I believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all
likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrasment to the
administration and the United States,'' Pell said.
   But he said that since Secchia is ``the president's choice'' he
would not try to block the nomination or delay action on it.

   Organization of American States foreign
ministers assembled here today for a historic debate on the Panama
crisis, with the United States prepared to ask for a resolution
demanding that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega step aside.
   President Bush's Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the White
House was ``confident there will be general hemispheric
condemnation of Noriega's actions'' at the session.
   ``We hope and expect the OAS will take a strong stand on Panama
and against the Noriega regime,'' Fitzwater said, adding the United
States would let other countries ``take the lead'' in proposing
specific motions. He said Secretary of State James A Baker III
would ``speak up forcefully regarding our views.''
   In Panama, opponents to Noriega called for a one-day general
strike today to protest the voided elections and the beating by the
general's supporters of political opposition leaders. But many
factories, stores and street stands were open, although commuter
traffic was lighter than normal.
   As the delegates prepared for their opening session, the United
States was emerging as perhaps the most militant of the 31 nations
represented here for the first special OAS foreign ministers
meeting in seven years.
   U.S. officials said Tuesday the Bush administration was ready to
ask the OAS to demand that Noriega step down following an election
10 days ago that the State Department claimed was rigged initially
and then voided when the fraud could not be concealed.
   But the preliminary signs for the administration were not
encouraging because two of the countries thought to be most
sympathetic to the U.S. view, Venezuela and Peru, were proposing
resolutions that fell far short of U.S. objectives.
   Neither mentions Noriega by name nor recommends that he step
down.
   At his daily White House briefing for reporters, Fitzwater said
the administration was not seeking a country where Noriega could
find exile.
   ``There have been a number of countries that have said they
would accept Gen. Noriega,'' he added. ``At least some of them are
countries that don't have extradition treaties with the United
States.''
   The OAS session evoked memories of one 10 years ago when OAS
foreign ministers, including then-U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance, demanded the resignation of Nicaraguan President Anastasio
Somoza. He fled less than a month later.
   This year, the delegates seem somewhat reluctant to interfere in
Panama's internal affairs to the degree that they did a decade ago
in Nicaragua.
   The Venezuelan draft calls for the ``immediate recognition'' of
the May 7 electoral returns in Panama while asserting that the
solution to Panama's crisis rests exclusively with the Panamanian
people.
   A U.S. official said the Venezuelan proposal is not plausible
because no accurate count of the election returns is possible since
most of the ballots have been destroyed.
   The Peruvian draft calls on the OAS secretary general to
facilitate a dialogue between the Panamanian government and
opposition, leading to the election of new authorities.
   Alternatively, other mechanisms would be agreed to that would
ensure ``the transfer of power'' in Panama.
   While Bush administration officials consider both drafts to be
tepid, the decision to raise the events surrounding the Panamanian
election to the highest hemispheric tribunal is seen as a plus for
U.S. policy.
   The United States has been attempting to topple Noriega for more
than a year, a policy that Panamanian delegates at today's meeting
are expected to seize on.
   Based on official statements in recent days, Panama was
preparing to accuse the United States at today's meeting of
systematic violation of Panamanian sovereignty in violation of the
OAS charter.
   As examples, Panama was intent on highlighting U.S. economic
sanctions imposed 14 months ago and the reported $10 million U.S.
government donation to opposition forces in Panama during the
election campaign.
   Venezuela requested the meeting after international observers
contended that the May 7 election was marked by massive fraud
committed by the pro-Noriega coalition.
   Subsequently, the results were tossed out after a bloody
confrontation between armed supporters of Noriega and opposition
demonstrators, including presidential candidate Guillermo Endara
and a vice presidential running mate, Guillermo Ford.
   Scenes of the bloodshed were widely disseminated outside Panama
and had a major impact on hemispheric public opinion.
   The dilemma facing the delegates stems partly from conflicting
provisions in the OAS charter. One paragraph calls representative
democracy an ``indispensible condition'' for stability in the
hemisphere while another stresses that no state shall be subject to
outside intervention ``for any reason whatsoever.''
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday
the administration looks forward to working with governments
throughout the hemisphere to develop ``action in support of
democracy'' in Panama.
   Indicating that the United States plans a circumspect role at
the meeting, Boucher said, ``This is a meeting called by Latins,
led by Latins, and we expect the result to reflect Latin interest
in democracy.''

   Federal drug policy coordinator William J.
Bennett met with commissioners and player representatives of
several professional sports today to exchange ideas on ways to
improve anti-drug standards for the country as well as pro
athletics.
   ``We all agreed on the importance of sports in American life,''
Bennett told reporters. ``We talked about the effort that
professional sports has made to get out a good, clear message to
kids about being drug-free, and the need to extend these efforts
and improve on them.''
   Bennett said he was anxious to see professional sports match the
fervent effort to curb drug use that he has suggested at the high
school level.
   ``I pressed pretty hard, I guess,'' he said. ``I said that from
my perspective, it would seem to me that when talked about being
tough on high school students and others, those policies needed to
matched at least at the level of professional sports.''
   No policies were put in place, but Bennett expressed hope that
some concrete ideas might come out of a follow-up meeting to be
held soon.
   ``Most important we have agreed to meet again this summer in a
month or two so we can have some specific suggestions for the
national strategy which I am writing,'' Bennett said.
   Among those at the meeting were National Football League
Commissioner Pete Rozelle, National Basketball Association
Commissioner David Stern and major league baseball Commissioner A.
Bartlett Giamatti.
   Steve Ryan, senior vice president for marketing and public
relations for the National Hockey League, was also present. NHL
President John Ziegler was not able to attend because of the start
of league playoffs.

   A tornado swept through a central Texas town early today,
killing one person, injuring at least two dozen others and
destroying an apartment complex while residents slept, state
officials said.
   Elsewhere in Texas, serious flooding in the Dallas-Fort Worth
area forced hundreds of people to evacuate to higher ground, and
two people were killed when their vehicles were swept away in
rain-swollen creeks. Police and firefighters performed several
dramatic rescues as the severe storm system brought a second day of
twisters, hail and heavy rain to the Southwest.
   ``I've been standing in water up to my elbows for the last
couple hours trying to get a couple gals out of a tree,'' said
Kennedale Police Chief David Geeslin. Their car had been washed off
the road.
   In the Northeast, showers stretched from eastern Virginia to
southern New England. There was widespread flooding in northern New
Jersey.
   The pre-dawn tornado caused widespread damage in the little town
of Jarrell, 40 miles north of Austin, when it stayed on the ground
for about seven miles, carving a mile-wide path of destruction.
   ``There was extensive damage downtown. A 15-unit apartment
complex was destroyed,'' said Mike Cox, spokesman for the Texas
Department of Public Safety. Williamson County Sheriff Jim Boutwell
said about 15 homes also were destroyed.
   ``It looked to me like more than one twister went through there
because there were some parallel areas'' of damage, he said.
   Several homes and businesses and the roof of the high school gym
were damaged, and at least six tractor-trailers were overturned on
Interstate 35, causing authorities to temporarily close a six-mile
stretch of the road.
   The body of a 42-year-old woman was found in the debris of a
mobile home destroyed by the tornado, Boutwell said. A man who was
in the mobile home was uninjured.
   Hospitals in Georgetown and Temples said 24 people sought
treatment and at least three were hospitalized. A police spokesman
had earlier reported 30 people injured, and it was not known if
some residents were treated at the scene.
   The Williamson County Sheriff's Department said at least three
other reports of extensive damage came from the southern and
southwestern parts of the county, where two more tornadoes were
sighted.
   In the Dallas area, a woman was killed when she drove around a
barricade and her car was swept from a bridge into a creek, and the
body of an elderly man was recovered from a truck in a creek
branch, police said.
   From 150 to 200 people were evacuated from south Dallas, 50
people from Grand Prairie, and 125 to 150 from Kennedale, police
said.
   A Kennedale city councilman used his boat to rescue a man who
had gone to check his cattle and was stranded by rapidly rising
waters, Geeslin said.
   The tornadoes came as severe thunderstorms unleashed twisters,
flash flooding and hail across a vast expanse of Texas from the Rio
Grande to the Red River.
   ``I've been working here since 1973 and this is the worst
thunderstorm I've ever seen,'' said Warren Kneis, supervisor for
the Federal Aviation Administration at the Dallas-Fort Worth
airport control tower.
   In addition to Texas, which got 7 inches of rain in some parts,
flood warnings were also issued for parts of Louisiana and
Oklahoma. A tornado touched down near Westcliffe, Colo., and huge
hail pelted Louisiana and Oklahoma.
   A weekend storm that damaged more than half of the 190 Apache
tank-killer helicopters at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas, could cost
$500 million, said Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the
House Defense Appropriations Committee.
   The weather service said 19 tornadoes had been reported in Texas
since Tuesday morning.
   Gainesville, a city of 14,000 people about 60 miles northwest of
Dallas, was among the hardest hit Tuesday. National Guardsmen
helped evacuate about 150 homes in low-lying areas threatened by
floods, said state Trooper M. Dial. Most evacuees were taken out by
boat.
   Animals at Gainesville's Frank Buck Zoo were taken to a cattle
auction barn because of flooding. Eighteen deer were missing, said
Milburn Cravens, Gainesville's director of community services.
   Emergency workers sandbagged houses in low-lying areas of
Idabel, Okla., after heavy rains threatened flooding. A flash flood
watch was still in effect today for much of southern Oklahoma.
Thunderstorms also pelted the western part of the state.
   In northern New Jersey, 11 counties were under flood warnings,
after another 2 inches of rain in the past 24 hours drenched the
already saturated area.
   There was widespread flooding in the Newark area, with water 2
to 3 feet deep clogging entrances to roads and stalling cars. Eight
residents of Westwood, N.J., who live near the Pascack Brook were
evacuated early today.
   Area meteorologists said more rain has fallen in the first 15
days of May than usually falls in the whole month. Newark
registered 4.2 inches between May 1 and midnight Monday, before the
new rains began, compared with an average of 3.6 inches for the
whole month.
   Similarly, the amount of rain that has fallen in the
Baltimore-Washington area in May is well over the average total for
the month.
   The National Weather Service reported that a stretch of 13
consecutive days of rain in May through today is the longest in 40
years of record-keeping at Baltimore-Washington International
Airport. The previous record for May was nine days set in 1979.

   ``Blame It on the Movies!'' is an overstuffed,
unoriginal musical revue, featuring too many songs from too many
movies.
   The show, which opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's Criterion
Center Stage Left, forsakes much of the familiar movie musical
material and concentrates on songs from non-musical films. That
means a lot of overwrought title tunes from a lot of overwrought
films such as ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,'' ``An Affair to
Remember'' and ``The Long Hot Summer.''
   Most of this moist music is sung during a segment saluting songs
from 20th Century-Fox movies. It's the best constructed of the
evening's half dozen or so long segments. The cast of eight singers
and dancers _ particularly Patty Tiffany and Bill Hutton _ wring
out each tear. It's the most emotion they show all evening.
   There are nearly 80 different songs in the revue, but most of
them whiz by in a blur, short musical phrases that sometimes seem
no more than a song title. Director David Galligan won't let the
show or the performers stop moving. What it lacks in style and fun,
it makes up for in speed.
   Barbara Sharma, who has a Betty Boop voice and a pretty good
Woody Woodpecker laugh, portrays the revue's one character, an
usherette who links the various portions of the entertainment
together. There's music from the 1940s, a World War II segment and
a homage to songs which lost Academy Awards. Miss Sharma also mugs
and sings some forgettable new material by veteran revue specialist
Billy Barnes.
   The performers often sound mechanical, their voices not enhanced
by the theater's tinny sound system. The singers work hard but
there is no spark or spontaneity to their performances.
   There is one plus, though. Theatergoers are given boxes of
popcorn as they enter the auditorium. The corn is freshly popped
and tasty, but even it doesn't help after a while. Watching ``Blame
It on the Movies!'' is like sitting through a bad double-feature
with no cartoon.

   The new secretary of the Navy, H. Lawrence
Garrett, joined a tribute Wednesday to the 37 sailors who died
aboard the USS Stark two years ago in the Persian Gulf .
   The men ``gave themselves to the greatest value of human
existence _ freedom,'' Garrett said.
   ``The men of Stark ... were patriots and professionals,'' he
said. ``They knew the possible costs of their commitment. Yet these
men chose still to serve. And the memory of their service, of their
sacrifice, of their commitment to the values of our nation serve us
still.''
   The ceremony, at the Navy Memorial on Pennsylvania Avenue, was
sponsored by the group ``No Greater Love.'' The organization was
founded to help the children of Vietnam War prisoners and missing
in action as well as the families of hostages or victims of
terrorist attacks.
   The 37 sailors killed on the Stark died when the ship was hit by
missiles fired by an Iraqi fighter while the frigate was conducting
a patrol in the Persian Gulf.
   Iraq subsequently apologized to the U.S. government, saying its
fighter had mistaken the Stark for a tanker bound for arch enemy
Iran.
   On March 28, Iraq agreed to pay $27.3 million in compensation to
the 37 families, and the settlement checks were distributed by the
Navy on April 28.
   Garrett, the under secretary of the Navy at the end of the
Reagan administration, was sworn in as the Navy's secretary on
Monday.

   The White House today voiced ``grave
concerns'' over a Senate amendment placing new restrictions on the
U.S.-Japanese FSX jet fighter project, claiming it could erode
presidential authority.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush told House
Republicans his administration would work against the amendment,
sponsored by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., when the measure gets to a
House-Senate conference.
   Bush met with GOP members in the Capitol at mid-morning.
   Earlier, the State Department said new restrictions imposed by
the Senate on the plan to coproduce the sophisticated new jet with
Japan may force the renegotiation of parts of the agreement.
   The Senate approved the project on a 52-47 vote Tuesday. But
then it adopted, 72-27, Byrd's amendment to tighten the conditions
under which codevelopment and coproduction would take place.
   Bush ``was very pleased by the overall vote. But we do have very
grave concerns about the Byrd amendment,'' Fitzwater said.
``Generally, it creates a system of congressional approval over
these kinds of projects that we consider to be erosive of
presidential power.''
   Even before Tuesday's vote, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
S. Eagleburger made it known that the administration regarded the
new directives as unneccessary and likely to trigger new and
lengthy negotiations.
   The votes came after two days of debate in which senators
emotionally and angrily denounced Japan for allegedly unfair trade
competition and sounded warnings that the deal could threaten U.S.
dominance of the aerospace industry by transferring vital
technology to Japanese industry.
   ``It would be foolhardy not to be vigilant in protecting our
aircraft industry and the vital technologies associated with it,''
Byrd said. ``This nation needs to get our economic relationship
with Japan on a saner and sounder track.''
   The amendment was opposed by the administration and Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas dubbed it a ``killer
amendment'' which would require the reopening of negotiations with
the Japanese government.
   Byrd said the amendment ``will not torpedo'' the deal but will
provide necessary protection for the United States.
   Roman Popadiuk, a Bush administration spokesman, noted the White
House had made the Senate aware of its objections to the Byrd
amendment in advance of the vote and said there would be no further
comment until its language was carefully considered.
   Eagleburger, in a letter circulated before the Senate action,
said additional restrictions imposed by Congress would ``inhibit
rather than facilitate'' the FSX program.
   He said the terms of the arrangements with Japan are already
consistent with the content of the amendment and do protect U.S.
``security, economic and technological strengths and interests.''
   ``Implementation of additional conditions ... which would
require renegotiation in some cases, would not materially advance
these objectives,'' Eagleburger said.
   The amendment prohibits the transfer of advanced jet engine
technology to the Japanese, in Byrd's words, ``under any
circumstances.''
   It would bar the Japanese from selling or transferring FSX
aircraft technology to third parties.
   ``No one expects the Japanese to turn this system into an export
item, and this provision simply makes it impermissible for the
Japanese to use the specific systems they are getting from us to
enter the international market,'' Byrd said.
   The amendment also expresses the sense of Congress that the
United States receive no less than 40 percent of the production
work on the aircraft.
   Byrd complained that the present arrangement calls for
``approximately'' 40 percent and said that was too vague and too
liable to result in future squabbles.
   During debate on resolution of disapproval, senators repeatedly
accused Japan of taking unfair economic advantage of the defense
umbrella the United States has provided since the end of World War
II.
   ``The United States is the very best friend they have ever had
in their entire history,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``We
provided a safe haven and a safe world that allowed them to
flourish beyond anything they ever could have done.''
   ``But I don't believe it is the action of an ally, a friend, a
partner,'' Domenici said, for the Japanese to refuse to buy the
existing American F-16 fighter ``off the shelf'' and to insist
instead ``on a half-baked deal'' to coproduce an entirely new
fighter using American technology.
   Dixon called the arrangement ``a sucker deal'' and ``a
tragically bad deal for America.
   ``We have a $54 billion trade deficit with the Japanese, and for
the one area _ aerospace _ in which we have a $19 billion trade
surplus, we want to give it to them on a golden platter.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told his colleagues: ``It will cost
Japan nearly three times as much per plane to coproduce the FSX as
it would to buy the F-16. Clearly, Japan wants whatever technology
it can acquire, so they can build not just an FSX _ but an aircraft
industry.''
   But Dole and Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who led the fight to
reject the disapproval resolution, said the plan is in the
interests of the United States for what they said are sound
military and economic reasons.
   They said the present plan, originaly negotiated by former
President Reagan and modified by Bush, gives Japan the advanced
aircraft it will need to fufill defense roles in the late 1990s and
also will provide a $2.5 billion benfit to the United States in
contracts and jobs.

<HEAD>Academy Didn't Include Enough Democrats to Qualify for IRS Tax Break</HEAD>

   The American Campaign Academy, which was
created to train political professionals, does not qualify for a
federal tax exemption because its work benefits Republican
candidates almost exclusively, the U.S. Tax Court ruled Wednesday.
   ``No graduate is known to have affiliated with any domestic
political party other than the Republican Party,'' Chief Judge
Arthur L. Nims III wrote for the court.
   ``We find that petitioner (the academy) operated to advance
Republican interests. We also find that the placement of 85 of
petitioner's graduates in the campaigns of 98 Republican senatorial
and congressional candidates (in 1986) conferred a benefit on those
candidates,'' the court concluded.
   The academy, located in Arlington, Va., had applied to the
Internal Revenue Service for a tax exemption as a charitable
educational organization. The IRS rejected the application on
grounds the academy failed to established that it was operated
exclusively for tax-exempt purposes.
   ``You are operated for a substantial non-exempt private
purpose,'' the IRS had ruled. ``You benefit Republican party
entities and candidates more than incidentally. Also, your
activities serve the private interests of Republican party entities
rather than public interests exclusively.''
   The academy appealed that decision to the Tax Court and lost.
   The academy was incorporated in January 1986 as an outgrowth of
the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is composed
of GOP members of the House of Representatives. Funding for the
academy is provided exclusively by the National Republican
Congressional Trust.
   Two of the academy's initial directors were Joseph Gaylord,
executive director of the committee, and John C. McDonald, a member
of the Republican National Committee.
   According to court records, the academy limits enrollment to
those aspiring to become campaign managers, fund-raisers or
communications specialists. Although the academy keeps no records
of political affiliations, it acknowledged that a substantial
number of its students _ as well as members of its admissions panel
_ are affiliated with the GOP.
   The academy contended that whatever private benefit went to the
GOP was incidental to a broader interest of educating the public.
The court held that the academy was created primarily to further
GOP interests.
   ``Had the record established that the academy's activities were
nonpartisan in nature and that its graduates were not intended to
primarily benefit Republicans, we would have a different case,''
Nims wrote. ``We are not, however, deciding such a case.''

<HEAD>Teachers Use Essays to Spot Personal Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When teachers grade the year-end essays
of 50,000 Louisiana high school sophomores, they'll also be reading
between the lines for signs of personal crisis such as suicidal
tendencies or child abuse.
   The essay portion of the statewide 10th-grade exam will be
graded by a company that will flag compositions that ``need to be
brought to someone's attention,'' Robert Schiller, Louisiana deputy
superintendent of education, said Tuesday.
   The Education Department will send alarming papers to school
districts, where officials will decide whether to intervene,
Schiller said.
   Critics of the plan said it is an invasion of students' privacy,
and they questioned whether the test-graders are qualified to
recognize psychological problems.
   Officials expect warning signs to crop up in 0.2 percent of the
tests, or about 100 students. The tests were given in April and are
being graded now.
   The supervisor of the state's school psychological services, Jim
Canfield, has filed a protest memo calling the practice ``immoral,
unethical and probably illegal.''
   The state is required by law to get parental consent before
using the exams to make psychological judgments, Canfield said.
   ``Their intent may be good, but there has to be prior consent,''
he said. ``Parents don't know that this is happening, and if
nothing else, they should be made aware.''
   Measurement Inc. of Greensboro, N.C., has hired 70 people to
score the tests, most of whom have bachelor's degrees in English or
education, said Rebecca Christian, assistant director of the
Education Department's bureau of accountability.
   Measurement Inc. has done similar work for Mississippi, New
Jersey, South Carolina and Texas.
   Wendy Littlefair, project coordinator at Measurement Inc., would
not discuss the procedure.
   The essays ask the student to write about teen-age problems, a
format that could give students a chance to express suicidal
tendencies, instances of child abuse or other problems, Christian
said.
   Schiller said the evaluation is legal and part of the state's
``moral obligation to protect youngsters.''
   ``Measurement Inc. has the capability to flag when there might
be a particular problem, and we are setting up a mechanism whereby
we might bring it to the attention of local districts,'' he said.
   East Baton Rouge Parish School Superintendent Bernard Weiss, a
former English teacher, said he had ``serious concerns about having
the background to make such an assertion about a child.''
   ``I certainly don't feel an English teacher is basically
qualified to make that kind of determination,'' he said.
   Keith Cruz, director of student assessments in Texas, said some
papers flagged by the company have been used in court in child
abuse cases.
   ``It's our idea to have the flagging done,'' Cruz said. ``It's
made us very proud to provide the school districts with help for
youngsters.''

<HEAD>Capitalism Thrives in Marxist-ruled Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Official media were silent when Moslem
guerrillas kept a column of gasoline trucks from reaching Kabul
recently, but the currency traders knew about it and moved the
dollar up against the afghani.
   Word came two days later that the army had reopened the road and
the convoy had safely completed the 260-mile journey from the
Soviet border. The sober-faced men on the bank of the Kabul River
moved the dollar down again.
   Capitalism flourishes in Kabul, which was a crossroads for
merchants and traders many centuries before it became a Marxist
capital 11 years ago.
   The money market, or serai shazad, is conducted in the inner
courtyard of a balconied building with rusting beams, where camel
trains once sojourned overnight.
   Traders in turbans count bundles of notes _ blue, beige, pink _
pausing occasionally to tend their goats or other animals grazing
nearby. It is no secret that the men who dominate the serai shazad
are wealthy, some of them millionaires many times over.
   Civil war, which began with a communist coup in April 1978, has
created periodic and sometimes critical shortages of food, fuel and
medicine.
   For those with money, however, the dun-colored city is a
cornucopia.
   Merchants sell goods from wooden containers at roadsides in
western Kabul. Business is always brisk in rice, flour, wheat,
kerosene and other goods taken from supply convoys that do not make
it through guerrilla-held territory.
   The pocked streets and winding alleys of the old bazaar overflow
with everything from expensive 100-year-old carpets and Mercedes
automobiles to Japanese videocassette recorders, Soviet combat
uniforms and second-hand Western jeans.
   Highways running north to the Soviet border and east to Pakistan
are the city's lifeline and what moves on them sets the rhythm of
the market.
   Helicopter gunships, tanks, rockets and artillery are some of
the tools used to keep them open.
   Then come lulls in guerrilla activity, when convoys rumble into
Kabul without interference. Juma Mohammad, a 38-year-old money
changer, says some rebel commanders have their price.
   ``In's really quite simple,'' he said. ``There is a road.
Somebody controls the road. Somebody else wants to use the road and
deals are made. It's strictly business.''
   Information moves through the money bazaar's grapevine as if it
were an electronic data system, and the afghani rises or falls as
convoys reach Kabul or are attacked.
   Pounds, marks francs and nearly all other currencies are traded,
but the dollar is supreme.
   Dollars, sometimes tens of thousands, are stacked neatly in
chipped cabinets in the traders' tiny offices on the balconies
overlooking the ``trading floor,'' which is dusty or muddy
depending on the weather.
   As Mohammad discusses rates on the telephone, other traders
stand nearby, listening attentively.
   Money is not their only business.
   ``We are international businessmen, Mohammad said. ``We buy and
sell everythingg. I have bank accounts in London, Geneva and Paris
and I have traveled the world.''
   Like most of his colleagues, Mohammad is strictly neutral in
talking about the war.
   ``War is terrible, but this is business,'' he said. ``We will
accept any government that will end this war and leave business
alone.''
   Mohammad Sayeed, a colleague, observed: ``If we are left to live
in peace, then the success we have will be nothing special. We will
just be rich.''

<HEAD>An Election, a Funeral; Ulster is Politics as Usual</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KILKEEL, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another election, another
funeral.
   While the populace trudged to the polls to elect its local
officials on Wednesday, the people of Kilkeel buried Malachy
Trainor, a carpenter, Roman Catholic and latest victim of
Protestant gunmen.
   Both events had an air of bleak inevitability. The election,
said the pundits, would change very little. And Trainor, said his
bishop, was the 34th victim of sectarianism he has buried in his
diocese since 1982.
   Trainor, 34, was doing a building job in a Protestant area of
Belfast on Monday when his killers got out of a car and opened fire.
   An outlawed Protestant organization, the Ulster Volunteer Force,
said he was active in the Irish Republican Army. His family
strongly denied it.
   ``The fact that the local police identified his murder as
nakedly sectarian shows that his only crime was to be a Catholic,''
Bishop Cahal Daly said at the funeral.
   In Kilkeel, Trainor's home town of 6,500 in the southeast of the
province, the church was packed. Bright sunshine turned the
graveyard grass an almost incandescent green. The Mourne Mountains
towered above, their foothills streaked with yellow gorse.
   Daly, wan and stooped, delivered a sermon in which he called
once more for an end to ``the creeping oil slick of sectarianism.''
   Daly said he could understand the Protestants' fear of the IRA,
but pleaded with them to believe that the Roman Catholic Church had
no part in the IRA campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule.
   At the same time, he ascribed Protestant sectarianism to
``plain, old-fashioned, unreconstructed anti-Roman Catholic
bigotry, based on outmoded theologies long since left far behind by
world Protestantism.''
   It was a message he has delivered many times, and he knew there
were those to whom Malachy Trainor was already just ``another
statistic _ today's news, forgotten next week'' in a cycle of
conflict nearing its 20th anniversary with more than 2,700 deaths.
   ``But that is not true,'' the 71-year-old bishop thundered.
``One never gets used to this sort of death.''
   After the service, weeping pallbearers carried Trainor into the
churchyard. A church bell tolled. Trainor's widow, Rosetta, sobbed
behind the coffin, her face crushed with despair, her aged father
on her arm.
   Trainor had three children, and was about to finish the new
family home he had built himself.
   Meanwhile, the people of Northern Ireland got on with their
election, trickling to polling stations to elect 566 councilors to
Northern Ireland's 26 local governments.
   Elections in Northern Ireland rarely amount to more than
sectarian head-counts. The overwhelming majority on both sides of
the divide vote for the parties of their religious persuasion,
which then wage wars of words in the council chambers.
   Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2 in Northern Ireland, and
will take the majority of the seats. So what matters is the
intra-community vote: whether the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein,
will gain or lose against the more moderate Catholics of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party; and whether, on the Protestant side,
the larger Ulster Unionist Party will stay ahead of the hard-line
Democratic Unionist Party.
   To the Irish Times in Dublin, atrocities like Trainor's murder,
or the IRA bomb attached to a Belfast lamppost that injured a
3-year-old girl in the foot Tuesday night, were ``a reminder to the
people of the North of the price they pay for political failure.''
   Outside a polling station in Kilkeel, the SDLP and Ulster
Unionists had parked rival caravans festooned with election posters.
   At the Unionists caravan, Billy Russell spoke in resigned tones
about Trainor's murder _ ``everybody's disgusted'' _ but was quick
to point out that 11 Protestants have also been murdered in the
district.
   Next door, the SDLP's Eddie McGrady conceded the difficulty of
playing politics in a battlefield.
   ``I get depressed twice a day,'' he said. ``But you have to keep
going, or else. If the moderates don't keep going, he hands over
the center ground to the extremists.''

   A dozen drama students have cast themselves in
the hero's role of China's student movement, vowing not to drink or
eat until the government agrees to discuss demands for a freer and
more democratic system.
   Their stage could not be better: a huge patch of Beijing's
biggest boulevard in front of the Great Hall of the People just off
Tiananmen Square, the symbolic political center of China.
   ``We are all artists,'' said Xiao Min, a 27-year-old set
designer at the Central Academy of Dramatic Arts. ``We had to take
this one step further.''
   More than 3,000 college students began a hunger strike for
democracy on Saturday. Xiao and his classmates, who already had
begun fasting, decided to stop drinking water Monday night.
   ``We were upset with the progress of things,'' Xiao said, as he
sat under a blanket on Changan Avenue. ``We decided we should be
ready to die.''
   From a high of 12, the number of people who are not drinking
water dwindled to five on Wednesday when seven were hospitalized.
   But several escaped from their hospital beds, ripping out the
intraveneous needles and rejoined their classmates. By midday, 10
students lay in the shade, sheltered by white sheets on bamboo
sticks.
   Xiao was one of them.
   ``My people are here and I had to be with them,'' he said,
clutching his left hand, swollen when he pulled a needle from his
vein. ``If we are going to fall, we will fall together.''
   Even more than the fasters, those students going without water
have touched a chord among Beijing residents _ of whom more than 1
million marched Wednesday to support calls for sweeping democratic
reforms.
   ``The government is killing them,'' said one high school teacher
as he demonstrated with his pupils near the fasting ground.
``Without water they will die. The government knows it must talk
with them.''
   On Wednesday, nurses and doctors hovered near the students.
   ``They all have fevers and we are worried about their hearts,''
said one doctor. He said nurses were dabbing their heads and lips
with wet cloths.
   As he spoke a siren cut the night and another student was taken
away. Seven remained, swathed in blankets.
   ``That was Xiao Ming. He is a veteran of our war with Vietnam.
That struggle didn't make him fall but this one has,'' Xiao said.
   Students lay under the portrait of a naked man and woman. A
poster reading, ``Save me,'' flapped in the wind.
   ``My child, you are burning up,'' cried one of their mothers as
temperatures soared into the low 80s.
   By late afternoon, the chrysanthemums and roses presented by
passers-by had wilted in the sun.
   ``They are still beautiful,'' Xiao said. ``I never thought my
people would raise their heads.''

<HEAD>Sun Now Also Rises On Hemingway Fishing Log in JFK Library Collection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ernest Hemingway went fishing in Cuba. He hooked
marlin. He kept a log. A friend typed it up. It now belongs to the
John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library.
   Ask why and you'll get a long story about a writer who liked
short sentences, and a literary president.
   Much of the log concerns spotting, chasing and catching big
fish. But there are also terse observations in which Hemingway,
referring to himself in third person, records the revolt that
brought dictator Fulgencio Batista to power.
   On Oct. 7, 1934, he noted: Havana ``is full of arms, ammunition,
dynamite. ... During the night there was dynamiting in the city and
shooting on both sides of the harbor. E.H. woke once in the night
when Arnold shouted out and covered the opening in the forward
hatch with a pistol. The Maestro was merely hooking fish in his
dreams.''
   The novelist and Kennedy never met but admired each other.
Hemingway was even invited to Kennedy's inauguration but declined
because he was in the throes of depression, said Megan Desnoyers,
curator of the collection.
   From the 1930s until Hemingway's suicide in Ketchum, Idaho, in
1961 the writer considered Cuba his home. But Kennedy had ordered
an embargo against Cuba after his enthusiasm for Fidel Castro
soured.
   So when Mary Hemingway, the writer's widow and fourth wife,
needed to collect the things her husband left behind, JFK gave her
special permission to return to Cuba.
   Then, in 1965 Jacqueline Kennedy and Mary Hemingway agreed their
late husbands' belongings belonged together in a clean,
well-lighted place. When the JFK library opened in 1979,
Hemingway's papers were there too.
   On Wednesday the boat log, purchased last year at auction for
$3,000, joined about 100,000 pages comprising 95 percent of
Hemingway's manuscripts, mementos such as the black tin trunk the
writer took on safari in Africa, and more than 100,000 photographs
of him in action, fighting and reporting wars, loving women and
going after fish.
   Patrick Hemingway, the second of Hemingway's three sons, came
from Bozeman, Mont., to attend the presentation of the 95 crumbling
brown pages typed on foolscap and now preserved under clear Mylar
sheets.
   A jolly round man with a moon face and the broad, warm grin he
inherited from his father, Patrick was 6 when his father went
fishing on the 38-foot Pilar. Now 60, the younger Hemingway was a
hunter in Africa in the 1960s and worked as a U.N. forester in
Tanzania. But at 6 he was the seasick son of a writer.
   His father was working on ``The Green Hills of Africa'' during
the fishing trip. But his son said it was probably also then that
his father first collected impressions for ``The Old Man and the
Sea,'' which won a Nobel Prize in 1952.
   ``That sort of thing was in his subconscious, from going to
fish,'' his son said.
   The Pilar was visited by the writer's many friends over the time
the log records, from October 1934 to January 1935. Through the
log's pages traipse such lights as the writer John Dos Passos and
editor Maxwell Perkins.
   The log actually is a transcription by Arnold Samuelson, who was
a 22-year-old would-be writer who hitchhiked from Minnesota to Key
West to spend nearly a year with his idol. After Samuelson's death
in 1981, the log went on the market.

<TEXT>
   Republicans are planning to challenge House
action on a savings and loan bailout bill approved by its Banking
Committee after Democrats changed the wording in a controversial
provision requiring S&amp;Ls to subsidize low-income housing.
   Committee chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said the
alteration in the 600-page bill reported to the full House on
Tuesday _ two weeks after it was approved by the panel _ was only a
technical change to ``define the clear intent of the committee.''
   Republicans, however, called it a power grab that was done
without a vote, and promised to fight it when the legislation is
referred to the House Rules Committee and on the House floor.
   ``The language in the report differs markedly from the language
as reported from the committee ...,'' said Assistant House GOP Whip
Robert Walker of Pennsylvania. ``Substantive sections of the bill
have been unilaterally changed by the chairman.''
   The uproar is over a provision authored by Gonzalez that the
banking committee's 20 Republicans unanimously opposed two weeks
ago. Basically, it would require S&amp;Ls to subsidize below-market
mortgage rates for low-income home buyers by $75 million a year
from 1990 to 1994 and by $150 million a year in 1995 and thereafter.
   According to consumer groups, the measure could provide 100,000
low-income home buyers with mortgages that are 2 percentage points
below market rates.
   ``If we're going to save a savings and loan system that has any
recognizable right to that name, then you have to do something
about making housing affordable,'' said Gonzalez.
   Republicans had opposed the measure as ``social engineering''
and said it did not belong in a bill in which taxpayers are being
asked to pay more than $200 billion over the next 30 years to cover
bad loans made by S&amp;Ls in the 1980s.
   The dispute was reignited last week when congressional tax
experts told the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee that
the low-income housing provision ``looks like a tax'' _ setting off
claims that the Banking Committee had exceeded its authority.
   ``It's a usurpation of this committee's jurisdiction by another
committee,'' charged Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the ranking
Republican on Ways and Means.
   Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., persuaded his
committee to defer striking the provision, which has widescale
support among Democrats, while he and Gonzalez attempted to work
out a compromise. The Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to
formally adopt the change on Thursday.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said an accord retaining the
provision but changing its language ``in a small way'' was reached
through mediation by House Speaker Jim Wright's office and Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee
on select revenue measures.
   As Gonzalez' measure was approved by the committee, the 12
district Federal Home Loan Banks that borrow funds for and are
owned by the industry would have to devote 5 percent of their ``net
earnings'' or profits, or a minimum of $75 million a year until
1994 for the new low-income mortgages.
   For 1994 the contribution was 6 percent of net earnings or a
minimum $90 million and from 1995 on it was 10 percent of net
earnings or a minimum $150 million a year.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has written
President Bush declaring a halt in shipments of Soviet arms to
Nicaragua, but weapons are continuing to arrive from Cuba and
Eastern European countries, the State Department said today.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher also said the level and pattern of
arms sales through April is very similar to that of 1988.
   He said 27 shipments of military goods were sent to Nicaragua
from the Soviet Union and its allies through April and that the
estimated value through March was about $80 million.
   Boucher said over the four months the arms were supplied by
Eastern Europe and Cuba, with the Soviets providing unspecificed
other military material.
   ``The general secretary indicated in his letter that the Soviets
have stopped sending weapons to Nicaragua,'' Boucher said,
confirming Gorbachev had made the pledge in a letter to Bush.
   The spokesman's statement echoed reports Monday night by The
Washington Post and The Associated Press that Gorbachev had
promised to end direct weapons shipments.
   The AP account, attributed to unidentified U.S. officials, said
Gorbachev had not promised to end delivery of non-lethal equipment,
such as vehicles, or said Cuba would no longer provide weapons to
the Sandinista government in Managua.
   The White House had said on Tuesday there was no proof that
Gorbachev had made good on his promise to halt weapons shipments to
Nicaragua.
   ``At the moment it appears to be only words, not deeds,'' said
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``We are very leery
of their intentions.''
   Despite Soviet statements to the United States that weapons
shipments to Nicaragua's leftist government have stopped, Fitzwater
said U.S. officials have some evidence the shipments are continuing.
   ``We're reluctant to be positive about this because we didn't
receive the kinds of public commitments or the kinds of visual ones
that we would like to see,'' he said.
   Despite his skepticism, Fitzwater acknowledged the United States
doesn't know enough about the weapons shipments to say conclusively
if Gorbachev is keeping his promise.
   Fitzwater said the material could have been in the pipeline when
Gorbachev made his promise or might be coming in from another
country, such as Cuba.
   ``I'm willing to leave the door open on the idea that maybe that
evidence (of continuing military shipments) is misleading,''
Fitzwater said.
   The Bush administration has been publicly and privately prodding
Gorbachev to discontinue aid to Nicaragua's Sandinistas, whose
rebel opponents, the Contras, have been supported by the United
States.
   Bush has approved a diplomatic, rather than military, approach
to peace in Nicaragua, and has indicated he would respond with
economic or other incentives for the Soviets if Moscow halts aid to
Central America.
   U.S. officials, who insisted on anonymity, said that not enough
was known about the weapons shipments to condemn Gorbachev. They
said they were unable to determine what the shipments contained and
whether the source was the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe or Cuba.
   In fact, one official said this year's shipments appear to be
going to Nicaragua at a slower rate than last year, when, during
the first half of the year, some $130 million to $150 million worth
of weapons were recorded going into Nicaragua.
   Referring to Gorbachev's high profile arms-cut proposals in
recent days, and the new promise on Nicaragua, Fitzwater defended
the Bush administration against allegations Gorbachev is taking the
lead in peace initiatives.
   Fitzwater said the administration's ``admittedly cautious
approach'' is contrasted with Gorbachev's ``one of throwing out in
a kind of a drugstore cowboy fashion one arms control proposal
after another.''
   Gorbachev's arms proposals had not all turned out to be the bold
initiatives they at first seemed, he said.
   ``We have seen a very strange pattern of public relations
gambits in the last month or two,'' said Fitzwater.
   Gorbachev's promise on Nicaragua won praise on Capitol Hill.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on Latin American affairs, said it would be
``an extremely important breakthrough'' if Gorbachev is ending
military aid to Nicaragua.
   ``And that ought to be treated seriously and not treated as if
it were humor,'' Dodd said.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said, ``It's high time that
the Soviet Union does stop supplying military support to Nicaragua.
If we're really to demilitarize the zone we really do need to get
foreign interests out of there.''
   Rep. Tom Foley, D-Wash., the House majority leader, called it
``a very welcome decision.''

   A half century ago Irene Opdyke spied on the
Nazis in Poland, then turned her boss' villa into a refuge for her
Jewish friends.
   Last month a group of Jews provided a refuge for Mrs. Opdyke's
83-year-old husband, William, who has Alzheimer's disease.
   Victory Village, a retirement community run by the Jewish Homes
for the Aging of Greater Los Angeles, calls it repayment of a war
debt. Mrs. Opdyke, 68, calls it a miracle.
   ``We violated all the rules. He's not from our region. We are
sectarian. We are so short of beds. But there are certain times
when there are no rules. This is one of those times,'' said Sheldon
Blumenthal, executive director at Victory Village.
   Mrs. Opdyke, raised a Catholic, said, ``Jewish people are my
friends, my family.''
   She recounted in broken English the aftermath of the 1939 German
invasion of her native Poland, when the Nazis seized Jewish
property and subjected Jews to forced labor and extermination camps.
   ``They were working as slaves in an ammunition factory. I was
there serving breakfast, luncheon and dinner to the German officers
and secretaries. We knew each other. We tried to create like a spy
organization,'' she siad.
   ``I listened with my eyes and ears, carry to the laundry room,
was spread all around. And it was working for quite a few months.
But then when we find out that's it, it will be end. They asked me
for help.''
   Remarkably, she was able to hide 12 people for eight months,
first in the basement and attic of a villa occupied by a German
major, and then in a tunnel below.
   ``I didn't have a home, family, just a tiny little room by the
diner. I could not take them there,'' she said. ``I prayed. I
prayed like I never prayed before. Not from Bible, from my heart.
And you know, couple days later, the major called me and said, `I
have villa. You be my housekeeper.'
   ``It was miracle. So I open window, one by one they came, they
were there. Then I realize we need a better hiding place because I
didn't know the major want to have parties and everything,'' she
said.
   She said one couple pointed out that the villa had belonged to a
Jew and might contain a hiding place. ``We search and we find it,''
she said.
   Mrs. Opdyke came to the United States in 1949. She married
William Opdyke, a Naval officer, 31 years ago. From time to time,
Mrs. Opdyke, an interior decorator, was called on by the Jewish
Federation to speak to young people about her role in the war.
   Then her husband got ill. Dementia changed his personality. His
memory came and went. He would shake, throw things, scream, yell,
forget and accuse others of imagining things. He stopped eating. He
started slurring his words.
   When she took him to a hospital, ``they said he was not sick
enough.'' She appealed to her insurance company but ``when you
needed help, forget it. It was bad,'' she said.
   She had known Esther L. Brenner, regional coordinator of the
U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum since 1986. After losing her
interior decorating business, Mrs. Opdyke depended more and more on
the stipends she received for speaking engagements.
   ``I called Esther and cried my heart out. She said, `I'll see
what I can do,''' Mrs. Opdyke said.
   Ms. Brenner contacted Victory Village, which admitted her
husband to its Alzheimer's unit on April 25.
   Unable to do much for her husband but visit, she said her zeal
is in her work.
   ``I can survive the trauma because I have so much to do. I am
traveling and speaking to thousands of children. ... I talk to them
about Holocaust,'' she said.
   ``I tell them to try and understand we all belong to one human
family and only one way to defeat the ignorance of prejudice is to
reach out _ reach out without nationality, religion, creed or
color.''

<HEAD>Navy Ceremonies Mark 2nd Anniversary of USS Stark Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former crewman of the USS Stark cast a
wreath into the water Wednesday to mark the second anniversary of
the Iraqi attack that killed 37 Americans and altered U.S. policy
in the Persian Gulf.
   The Pentagon, meanwhile, disclosed that $27.3 million in
compensation for the dead has been paid by Iraq and distributed to
their families. Millions in additional claims for the wounded and
damage to the ship remain to be settled.
   The Stark, a 3,600-ton missile frigate, was nearly sunk on May
17, 1987, by two French-made Exocet missiles fired by an Iraqi
warplane, while the ship was conducting what U.S. officials called
routine duty in the central gulf.
   The attack killed 37 of its crew of 220 and injured 21. Iraq
later apologized, saying the pilot of the F-1 Mirage had mistaken
the U.S. frigate for an Iranian ship.
   The incident spurred the United States to expand its forces in
the gulf to protect U.S.-flagged shipping from the ``tanker war,''
a spinoff of the Iraq-Iran war. It also led to a revised policy
that U.S. commanders should not hesitate to fire first if they
believed an attack was immiment.
   With the waterway quiet since Iraq and Iran agreed to a
cease-fire Aug. 20, the United States has cut its regional force
from 40 ships to 19, but continues to ``maintain a presence, show
the flag and monitor U.S.-flagged shipping,'' a Navy spokesman said.
   The 10-ship gulf patrol unit would be trimmed further if the
Pentagon approves a plan to remove the last three mine sweepers
dispatched in 1987, U.S. sources said.
   The memorial service was performed aboard the USS Curts, now on
duty in the northern gulf, according to Navy witnesses.
   Sonar Technician 3rd Class Philip Matagavage, 22, of Hellertown,
Pa., a Stark crewman at the time of the attack, tossed the wreath
over the side on the final note of the Navy hymn, ``Eternal
Father.'' A 21-gun salute echoed across the calm waters and a
crewman played taps on a trombone.
   Cmdr. David J. Alexander, of New London, Conn., skipper of the
Curts, told his sailors who had assembled on deck in dress whites
that the Stark was saved by its crew in a 24-hour battle against
flames fed by missile fuel.
   ``They simply would not let their shipmates fail each other or
their ship,'' Alexander said.
   At a local school, U.S. Ambassador Sam H. Zakhem and Rear Adm.
William M. Fogarty, commander of the U.S. Joint Task Force Middle
East, also praised the Stark crew's courage and sacrifice.
   ``For a grateful nation tha since birth has paid the price, we
say to the men of Stark, `Thank you,''' said Fogarty.
   The Navy also circulated to all ships a suggested prayer on
behalf of ``our comrades who have lost their lives in defense of
freedom in the gulf these past years.''
   The death toll of 53 since 1987 includes the Stark victims, 14
killed in air crashes and two in a carrier deck fire.
   Iraq has paid $27.3 million in compensation for the dead aboard
the Stark and the checks were distributed to the families April 28,
according to Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, a Pentagon spokeswoman.
   Baghdad had agreed to the restitution in March after months of
prodding by the United States. It came to about 92 percent of the
original U.S. demand.
   Still to be submitted by the United States are separate claims
for the 21 injured and an $82.9 million bill for damage to the
ship. The rebuilt Stark returned to sea duty last year.
   Zakhem said Mrs. Barbara Kiser, a Stark widow, flew to Baghdad
to donate a $10,000 check out of her settlement to an Iraqi war
orphans home.
   A Pentagon inquiry following the Stark incident found that its
commander had failed to defend his ship adequately in dangerous, if
ambiguous, circumstances. He and and another officer were allowed
to resign from the Navy rather than face court-martial.
   The revised policy allowing commanders to shoot first if under
apparent threat was cited by U.S. officials after the cruiser USS
Vincennes mistakenly shot down an Iranian jetliner July 3. All 290
aboard the plane were killed.

<HEAD>Group Proposes Memorial to Crime Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nonprofit group based in suburban Virginia
said Wednesday it was launching an effort to organize support for a
Washington memorial dedicated to the victims of crime.
   ``Many victims and families of victims for years have expressed
a need for a public place that remembers victims who are killed and
marks the grief and suffering of survivors and loved ones,'' said
John Wheeler, president of the Center for the Vietnam Generation,
based in McLean, Va.
   He added that ``a beautiful, landscaped memorial for victims of
crime could prove to be a turning point in healing the dreadful
national situation of violence, disrespect, drug and alcohol abuse
and diminished sense of community.''
   Wheeler told a news conference that he would like to see a
memorial built on privately owned land near Pennsylvania Avenue
between the White House and the Capitol.
   Locating the memorial on privately owned property rather than on
the Mall or other public land, he said, ``avoids the difficulties
of having to go to Congress and to the several government approval
agancies.''
   Money for the project, expected to cost $10 million to $20
million, would come from philanthropists, real estate developers
and individual donors, Wheeler said.
   He said that over the next six months, he was aiming to organize
a coalition of organizations and individuals to support the
proposal. Groups that have already agreed to join the effort,
Wheeler said, include the Washington-based National Organization
for Victim Assistance and the National Victim Center of Fort Worth,
Texas.
   The Center for the Vietnam Generation describes itself as a
nonprofit group ``fostering knowledge about the 60 million
Americans who came of age in the Vietnam era'' and advocating
public service.

   A court on Wednesday convicted
Mohammed Ali Hamadi of hijacking a TWA jetliner and killing a U.S.
sailor, then sentenced him to life in prison for crimes the
murdered man's parents said deserve death.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger gave the Lebanese Shiite Moslem
the maximum penalty for the 1985 hijacking and the brutal beating
and murder of Robert Stethem, 23, of Waldorf, Md. West Germany has
no death penalty.
   Hamadi's trial provided a rare look into the planning and
execution of a major terrorist attack, plus chilling witness
testimony of the terror and brutality aboard the seized aircraft.
   During the ordeal, 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   The parents of the slain Navy diver, breaking the silence they
had kept throughout the 10-month trial, said death would have been
a more appropriate penalty for the 24-year-old terrorist.
   ``Our family maintains Mohammed Ali Hamadi deserves punishment
more severe than allowable under German law,'' Richard L. Stethem
said.
   But the couple said the West German court conducted a fair and
impartial trial. They warned, however, against the ``possible
political commutation'' of Hamadi's sentence.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that
while ``we would have preferred extradition'' to the United States,
``we were satisfied and gratified by the outcome.
   ``We expect he will serve his full sentence in accordance with
German law,'' Fitzwater said.
   Peter Korneck, one of the prosecutors, said Hamadi will be
eligible for a parole review in 15 years. Hamadi's defense lawyers
said they expected to appeal the sentence.
   The Stethems attended all of the trial's 65 sessions since it
began July 5, 1988.
   ``Our purpose for being there was to represent our son. I
thought he deserved that. With all his bravery I felt he deserved
more than that,'' Patricia Stethem said, her voice quaking with
emotion.
   Mueckenberger announced the verdict and sentence to a packed
courtroom inside the fortress-like Preungesheim prison in Frankfurt.
   The judge said the court found Hamadi guilty of ``joint
participation in murder'' in the killing of Stethem, who was shot
in the head.
   During the trial, Hamadi denied shooting Stethem, saying the
bullet was fired by his accomplice, Hassan Ezzeddine, who remains a
fugitive.
   Hamadi confessed to the hijacking charge shortly after the trial
began.
   TWA Flight 847 was seized on June 14, 1985, after the Boeing 727
took off from Athens for Rome. The plane flew twice to Algiers and
three times to Beirut on the hijackers' orders.
   Stethem was shot and thrown onto the runway to die when the
plane landed the second time in Beirut on June 15, 1985.
   The judge described Stethem as ``tall, strong, well-built,
self-confident, good-looking man with a military posture.'' He said
Hamadi took Stethem to the front of the plane, tied his hands,
blindfolded him and threw him to the floor shortly before the
sailor was shot.
   Mueckenberger said the court was unable to decide who actually
shot Stethem.
   ``But the defendant knowingly and willingly participated in
Stethem's killing and actively took part in its preparation,'' he
said.
   The judge said Hamadi was an ``active member'' of Hezbollah, a
radical Shiite Moslem group backed by Iran that is believed to hold
Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Mueckenberger said he did not believe a milder sentence would
have changed Hamadi's convictions. ``We think he would return to
live in his homeland and again join Hezbollah. He identifies with
Hezbollah's aims of terrorism and violence.''
   During the proceedings, Hamadi had testified that the goal of
the hijacking was to force the release of Lebanese Moslems
imprisoned in Israel. Shortly after the ordeal ended, Israel
released about 700 such prisoners.
   Hamadi also was convicted of hostage-taking and three counts of
causing grievous bodily harm in the beatings of Stethem and two
other American passengers, Clinton Suggs and Kurt Carlson of
Rockford, Ill. Suggs is a native of Elkhart, Ind.
   He was also found guilty on two counts of smuggling explosives
into West Germany. Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan.
13, 1987, when customs officials found such explosives in his
luggage.

<TEXT>
   Banned playwright Vaclav Havel, a
symbol of dissent in this communist country, was paroled for good
behavior Wednesday midway through an eight-month jail sentence.
   Jiri Wolf, a leader of the Charter 77 human rights movement who
spent six years in prison for subversion, also was freed Wednesday.
Unlike Havel, Wolf was not granted parole and served his full term.
   Havel's arrest during demonstrations in January caused protest
in the West and among Hungarian, Polish and Soviet intellectuals.
It marked the beginning of a crackdown on dissent that conflicted
with reforms under way elsewhere in the Soviet bloc.
   Hours after being freed, Havel was speaking out for political
reform and urging those who campaigned for his release not to
forget about other political prisoners.
   He and his brother, Ivan, said the release was a victory for
thousands of Czechoslovaks who signed petitions protesting Havel's
arrest and supporting his request for parole.
   At least 20 people have been jailed, fined or given suspended
sentences since the January protests.
   Havel said Czechoslovak leaders have adopted the language of
reform, but have yet to emulate what he described as the
astonishing change occurring in Hungary, Poland and Moscow.
   ``Changes of the facade, not of the structure,'' have taken
place in Czechoslovakia, Havel told a Czech reporter who shared the
comments with other journalists.
   A step toward genuine change, Havel said, would be the
retirement of Communist Party chief Milos Jakes and other leaders
who presided over the death of reform after the 1968 Soviet
invasion ended the liberal ``Prague Spring.''
   Jakes welcomed President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, who runs
the most repressive regime in the Soviet bloc, for a one-day visit
Wednesday. A statement issued after their talks stressed the right
of each Communist Party to pursue its own policies.
   Ivan Havel and other dissidents speculated the decision to
release his brother was intended to deflect Western criticism of
Czechoslovakia's record at a 35-nation human rights conference that
begins May 30 in Paris.
   He said he believed domestic support for the playwright put
pressure on the regime, noting that a petition signed by 3,000
people backing the request for parole was ``not done by dissidents,
but by the broader public.''
   Havel was sentenced Feb. 22 to nine months on charges of
incitement and obstructing a police officer. An appeals court
reduced the sentence in March to eight months, dropping the
obstruction charge.
   Police arrested Havel on Jan. 16 at an unofficial memorial
ceremony in Prague's Wenceslas Square for Jan Palach, a student who
burned himself alive in January 1969 to protest the crushing of
reforms.
   On Wednesday, the playwright said he was reminded of his growing
status as a national figure by the privileged treatment he received
in prison.
   Conditions were much better than during a 4{-year jail term to
which he was sentenced in 1979 on subversion charges, Havel said.
   ``The prison staff expressed so much sympathy with me that I was
embarrassed because of the bitter thought: What about the others?''
he said.
   Havel said he wrote very little in jail because he was not sure
he could get the material out. His works are performed in the West
and in Poland, but are banned in Czechoslovakia.

<TEXT>
   The House today passed a bipartisan, $1.17
trillion federal budget for the next fiscal year.
   On a 241-185 vote, the House signed off on the 1990 budget. The
Senate planned to give final approval to the package tonight or
Thursday.
   Critics said the blueprint did not reduce the deficit
sufficiently. But other lawmakers said it was better than a long,
bitter dispute between Republicans opposed to higher taxes and
Democrats eager to protect domestic spending.
   ``If we haven't achieved legislation perfection, we have at
least avoided legislative gridlock,'' said House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   But progress is expected to be slower on a multibillion-dollar
spending bill for this year, which has been mired because of
disputes over money it contains for anti-drug initiatives.
   ``We're going to get it up as soon as we can,'' House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., said
Tuesday after a day of closed-door talks about the measure.
   If Congress kept to its schedule on the much less controversial
1990 budget _ no serious opposition was expected _ it would be the
earliest lawmakers have disposed of the spending plan since 1978.
   The legislators' speed is attributable to two factors.
   One is that overall totals for defense and domestic spending,
and other tough decisions such as the $99.7 billion deficit it
contains, were decided last month by Bush administration officials
and congressional leaders of both parties.
   The other is that the spending plan contains little real pain,
despite its effort to lop $28 billion off the federal deficit. Many
lawmakers and other critics have said this is accomplished with
optimistic economic projections that make the shortfall seem
smaller, and one-time gimmicks such as claiming $1.8 billion in
savings by moving the Postal Service ``off budget.''
   Science, education, health, housing and law enforcement spending
would receive healthy increases.
   Defense spending would rise to $299.2 billion, $4.2 billion
short of the amount needed to keep up with inflation. Agriculture
and transportation programs would also be pinched. The measure
calls for $5.3 billion in new tax receipts, but the decision on
where it would come from will be made later.
   On Tuesday, the Bush administration tried to coax congressional
Democrats to finally pass a 1989 spending bill that includes $340
million for veterans health programs.
   Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski wrote Whitten on
Tuesday that without the money, workforce reductions and delayed
purchases of medical equipment would occur. The veterans medical
program, he said, is ``in a state of emergency.''
   The measure was bogged down because of a dispute over $822
million for anti-drug efforts that it also contains. The
administration says the spending can wait until next year, and
threatened to veto the bill unless it was removed.
   Meanwhile, congressional leaders and President Bush met at the
White House Tuesday to discuss the fiscal 1991 budget. The
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law sets a deficit target of $64
billion for that year, and participants agree that meeting the goal
will be difficult.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said the meeting produced ``some good progress'' toward
discussions on sticky subjects such as taxes and spending cuts.
   ``The only specifics that we all discussed there was the fact
that everything is going to have to be on the table _ defense,
entitlements, taxes, all three are going to have to be part of that
kind of package,'' he said.
   ``There weren't any violent reactions,'' said House Speaker Jim
Wright of Texas when reporters asked him how Bush had reacted to
suggestions of new taxes.

   Representatives of the four largest commodity
futures exchanges told the Senate Wednesday they were opposed to
any additional legislation regulating their industry.
   ``We recognize that, in recent months, some have questioned our
integrity and expressed doubt about our ability to police our
markets,'' said Karsten Mahlmann, chairman of the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   But he said that the existence of the exchange ``depends on our
integrity.'' He outlined for the Senate Agriculture Committee the
surveillance procedures the exchange uses to detect trading
improprieties.
   Mahlmann's opinion was shared by Leo Melamed, chairman of the
Chicago Mercentile Exchange; Z. Lou Guttman, chairman of the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and Robert Fink, first vice president of
the Commodity Exchange Inc.
   They also explained how they monitor traders to protect against
misdeeds and the penalities imposed when wrongdoers are discovered.
   Sen. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., however, challenged their diligence,
saying he thought violations in student loans and among farm
borrowers were being pursued more vigorously than in commodity
futures trading.
   He cited Justice Department figures showing that $12 million in
fines for trading violations had not been collected.
   ``I think the message going out to crooks and swindlers is `the
odds are in your favor','' said Kerrey.
   He said he wanted figures from the industry executives on the
exact amounts collected in fines, which all four said they would
supply later.
   Their appearances were part of Congress' inquiry into
commodities trading before reauthorizing the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the federal agency charged with overseeing such
markets.
   After it was revealed earlier this year that the FBI had been
conducting an undercover investigation of alleged fraud on the
Chicago exchanges, Congress has been considering strengthening the
powers of the CFTC.
   At a previous hearing before the Agriculture Committee, the
General Accounting Office questioned the intensity of exchange and
CFTC efforts to detect and punish trading abuses.
   At another earlier session, the CFTC issued reports that were
critical of some of the exchanges' internal enforcement programs.
   In gathering information about the futures industry, the
committee has expressed concern about statistics showing that the
Board of Trade has levied significantly fewer sanctions against
violators than the other exchanges in relation to their size.
   Mahlmann said the figures the committee had received from the
CFTC were wrong. He said that the Board of Trade had levied $1.45
million in fines in 1988, not the $287,000 shown by the CFTC.
   When Leahy asked him how the discrepancy could exist, Mahlmann
said the lower figure resulted from ``a very narrow
interpretation'' of what a violation was.

<TEXT>
   After surviving years of harassment by
authorities, Poland's top underground publishers exhibited hundreds
of uncensored books for the first time Wednesday at an official
international book fair.
   ``Times have really changed,'' said Jan Kofman, an editor of the
poltical quarterly Krytyka, as he answered questions from people
who crowded around the display.
   ``Next year we are going to have our books shown right in the
center (of the show),'' said Grzegorz Boguta, the head of NOWA, the
Independent Publishing House, the country's premier clandestine
publisher.
   NOWA and other independent publishing houses such as Krag, CDN
and Przedswit were tucked away at the end of a corridor off the
main hall of the cavernous Palace of Culture, a skyscraper built by
the Soviet Union for Poland that dominates downtown Warsaw.
   ``The main question people ask is where they can buy the
books,'' Kofman said. At one point, Rudi Jankovic, director of
Quadra Enterprises Ltd, a private British book distributor, walked
up and offered to buy and market Nowa's entire underground display.
   ``This is real publishing, aggressive and creative,'' Jankovic
said.
   Boguta said the exhibits represent the first step to operating
as a normal publishing house, but that there is still a long way to
go.
   ``There is now a very optimistic political situation for
underground publishing houses. We want to be official because we
want to publish more, better quality books than today, but
uncensored,'' he said.
   Toleration of underground publishers, known in Poland as ``the
second circulation,'' has been growing in the last year _
especially after the start of formal talks between the opposition
and authorities in February.
   Among NOWA's more than 400 titles published in the last 12 years
are books by such authors as Nobel Prize winners Alexander
Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov, philosophers Hannah Arendt and
Jean-Paul Sartre, and American writers Kurt Vonnegut Jr. and Philip
Roth.
   NOWA was also one of the main outlets for Polish opposition
activists such as essayist Adam Michnik, political theorist Jacek
Kuron and labor leader Zbigniew Bujak.
   But why should underground publishers surface at all?
   ``We couldn't stay hidden. We can publish only a few thousands
copies of books in very poor technical conditions. Now censorship
is very liberal,'' Boguta said. ``Now we have a chance to be
official, but we must be quite independent.''
   Boguta, who also heads the group Association for Free Speech,
would like to create a nationwide network of independent book clubs
and start a company with foreign investors to publish uncensored
books.
   On a lower level of the Palace of Culture, the emigre press also
was allowed for the first time to exhibit Polish-language books
printed abroad, including works long banned.
   A crowd peered at editions published by the Paris-based Kultura
that has published many of Poland's finest authors and preserved
them from oblivion.
   Not all authors must rely on the independent press to get books
published.
   The official Czytelnik publisher announced a Polish edition of
``Mercy and Gallows,'' a social history on charity from the Middle
Ages to the present by Bronislaw Geremek, a historian and adviser
to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   Czytelnik also has published ``The Painted Bird'' by Jerzy
Kosinski, an emigrant to the United States long vilified in his
homeland but recently restored to official good graces.
   The Catholic publishing house Znak took orders for its books
that include the Polish version of Walesa's autobiography, ``A Way
of Hope.''
   More than 20 countries are represented at the fair. All of the
East bloc countries except Romania have displays and there are
publishers from West Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy and the
United States.

   School officials are hoping a visit
Thursday by President Bush will help boost confidence in an
innovative new setup that offers teachers big pay raises for more
work and more responsibility.
   Critics of the plan adopted two years ago say it has not paid
off in better education.
   ``We sure could use the president's power of persuasion that
there's no alternative but to improve public education,'' said Adam
Urbanski, president of the teachers union.
   Urbanski helped formulate a three-year teacher contract to boost
salaries and make teachers more accountable for what goes on in the
classroom. Education reformers pointed to the program adopted by
the district as a model for the nation.
   Bush is expected to visit Wilson Magnet High School, an
inner-city showcase for the changes going on in the district. He
also is scheduled to give a speech about education at an Eastman
Kodak Co. plant in the suburb of Gates.
   The visit comes as officials feel increasing pressure to show
that education has improved since teachers were given the chance to
earn $60,000 to $70,000 a year in exchange for more work and
responsibility for the curriculum and spending.
   ``We understand that the public wants to see some kind of
result,'' said Benjamin Douglas, school board president. ``I hope
they realize that President Bush's visit is recognition that we're
further down the road of reform than most places.''
   Last week, school officials asked the city to increase school
taxes 10.2 percent to help continue the program, and critics became
more outspoken.
   ``Over a two-year period they've asked for almost a 20 percent
increase,'' said Gordon Johnson, executive director of the
Rochester-based Citizens Tax League. ``Any time any unit of
government keeps galloping along at 10 percent while inflation is
running at 2 and 3 percent, it's too much.''
   Advocates of the setup, like William Johnson, president of the
city's Urban League, also are starting to express concerns. ``I'm
still optimistic, but I think we should be able to see some
instant, short-term improvement that can be measured,'' he said.

   President Bush is losing a global public
relations war against Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev by
making lackluster arms control proposals and offering ``no vision''
of a better world, the House Armed Services Committee chairman
charged Wednesday.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., in a hearing before his panel, also
chastised the White House for making belittling statements about
the Soviet leader instead of moving to counter his plethora of arms
control proposals with imaginative responses.
   ``Not only is this administration not very good on substance _
they're not very good on p.r. (public relations),'' Aspin said.
   Aspin charged that the administration has chosen a cautious and
reactive ``stand pat'' approach to Gorbachev, rather than
attempting to challenge the Soviet leader with ambitious proposals.
Aspin particularly complained the administration's proposals to cut
conventional forces in Europe were ``unambitious.''
   ``It's not just a p.r. problem _ it's a substantive problem. If
we want to score, we've got to come up with some creative,
seize-the-opportunity initiatives,'' Aspin said. ``You guys need a
proposal _ and frankly `Open Skies' doesn't make it.''
   Last week, Bush called for a revival of the 1950s ``Open Skies''
proposal by President Eisenhower that would have allowed the
Soviets and United States to fly unarmed inspection aircraft over
the other's territory. The 30-year-old proposal was never
implemented.
   Other House Democrats told Paul Wolfowitz, undersecretary of
defense for policy, and Reginald Bartholomew, undersecretary of
state for security assistance, that the administration has not done
enough to battle Gorbachev's initiatives, particularly in light of
the heated argument within the NATO alliance over modernizing the
pact's short-range nuclear weapons.
   The issue is expected to prove devisive at Bush's first NATO
summit later this month.
   The United States and Britain want to move forward with the
modernization of the Lance missile force, but West Germany and
several smaller nations oppose it. The West Germans have also
called for U.S.-Soviet negotiations on reducing or eliminating the
weapons, but the United States objects, contending the weapons are
needed to deter any attack from the larger Soviet bloc ground and
tank forces.
   Wolfowitz and Bartholomew argued that many of Gorbachev's
initiatives, such as his most recent offering to get rid of 500
short-range nuclear weapons, were designed to glean publicity and
were not actually substantial when viewed against the overwhelming
superiority in Warsaw Pact forces.
   And, they argued, Gorbachev is actually getting mileage by
moving closer to positions the United States has long advocated
   ``It's not a pure picture of progress,'' Wolfowitz said.
``Instead of `new thinking,' we're still seeing a lot of old
thinking,'' he added, noting that the Soviets still retain the
largest armed force structure in the world.
   ``We have to keep our eyes on the warts as well as the more
positive steps that have been taken,'' Bartholomew said.
   Wolfowitz and Bartholomew said that the administration was being
cautious in areas where they deemed it was necessary, and had put
forward a serious and far-reaching proposals to trim the
conventional forces in Europe, which the Soviets are now just
coming around to meet.
   But Aspin argued that even though the administration's position
might find agreement among diplomats and the military, it wasn't
winning in the political arena.
   ``You can't beat something with nothing in politics,'' he said.
``There's no vision there. ... You have to give me a better world I
can point to. ... You've got to have some vision out there _ and it
just ain't there.''
   Aspin also criticized statements made Tuesday by White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who said the administration of
``leery'' of Gorbachev's promise to halt military aid to Nicaragua.
Fitzwater also accused Gorbachev of throwing out arms control
proposals like a ``drugstore cowboy'' in the effort to win
attention.
   ``I don't think you ought to run down the Gorbachev proposals. I
don't think the kind of statements Marlin Fitzwater is making are
helpful,'' Aspin said.

   As she strolled down Changan Avenue with more than 1 million
other protesters, the young entrepreneur was just one
representative of the many segments of society in Wednesday's march.
   Striking taxi drivers honked their horns and hung flags out

   Soldiers and steel workers also protested.
   Not to be outdone, a group of men proudly marched beneath a

<HEAD>Administration Opposes Broadening College Savings Bond Provision</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Wednesday opposed
broadening a new tax provision designed to encourage saving for a
college education.
   A parent may avoid federal income tax on a Series EE savings
bond issued after this year that is redeemed to pay
higher-education expenses for the parent, a spouse or dependent.
The same benefit will be available to a student 24 or older.
   The tax benefit is phased down once a couple's income reaches
$60,000 and ends at $90,000.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., has introduced a bill that would
extend the benefit to bonds used for higher-education expenses of
any person _ not just the owner's immediate family. Thus, a
grandparent could use a tax-exempt bond to pay tuition for a
grandchild.
   ``We are concerned that the purposes of the phase-out could be
easily circumvented'' under the bill, Dana L. Trier, tax
legislative counsel for the Treasury Department, told the Senate
Finance Committee.
   He said, for example, that a wealthy person could give tax-free
money to a parent with a low income; the parent would buy bonds
with the money, and the proceeds later would be used to finance the
education of a grandchild.
   Trier estimated Exon's proposal would cost the government about
$300 million over five years.

<HEAD>Record Export Sales Send Deficit Shooting Downward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit, bolstered by record
export sales, shrank dramatically to $8.86 billion in March, the
government said Wednesday in a report that prompted some economists
to question their earlier assessment that the country's trade
improvement had stalled out.
   The Commerce Department said the March deficit was down 9.8
percent from the February imbalance of $9.82 billion, a figure that
was itself lowered from an initial report a month ago, which had
put the February deficit at $10.5 billion.
   The March improvement came from a 7.4 percent rise in exports,
which hit a record $30.78 billion. Imports rose 3 percent to $39.64
billion, pushed upward by rising oil prices.
   Analysts, who had been looking for little or no improvement in
the March figure, noted that sales of American manufactured goods
and farm products were up sharply, helping to lower the deficit
with all major U.S. trading partners.
   The deficit with Canada, the country's largest trading partner,
declined to $248 million, its lowest in almost eight years. The
United States ran a rare trade surplus of $397 million with Western
Europe, the best showing in six years.
   The trade report was hailed as good news by the Bush
administration, which is counting on continued strength in American
exports to propel domestic growth this year.
   ``These numbers support our contention that a favorable movement
in our exports and imports is underway,'' said Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher. He noted that the average overall monthly deficit
from January through March was 10 percent lower than the average
from October through Decmeber.
   Prviate economists have been worried that the dollar's strength
over the last year could jeopardize further trade improvements by
making American goods more expensive overseas.
   After reviewing the March figures, however, some analysts said
they were revising their trade projections for 1989 based on a
belief that strong economic growth overseas was fueling demand for
American products and would offset the adverse effects from the
dollar's increase.
   ``U.S. trade is off the sticky track and has moved to a
permanently improved position,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist
of the Boston Co. ``Healthy economies overseas contributed to an
explosion of exports in March.''
   Last year, the trade deficit shrank by $32 billion to $119.76
billion, down from an all-time high of $152.12 billion in 1987.
   Sinai said he was looking for the 1989 improvement to be around
$16 billion, putting the deficit at $103 billion. For the first
three months of this year, the deficit was running at an annual
rate of $109.4 billion.
   ``The performance in the first quarter suggests that demand
abroad is vigorous and American firms are competitive enough to
take advantage of it,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist of
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   But some economists remained unconvinced that the trade deficit
would show much improvement this year, based on a belief that
rising oil prices and continued strong demand for imports would
offset any further gains in export sales.
   ``There is not a chance that this trend toward lower trade
deficits will continue,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington
forecasting firm. ``I expect to see $10 billion to $11 billion
monthly trade deficits for the rest of the year.''
   The Bush administration has a lot riding on the country's trade
performance because it needs robust economic growth to bring in
enough revenues to lower the federal budget deficit without raising
taxes. Last year's trade improvement was responsible for almost
half of total growth in the economy.
   The March trade improvement came despite the fact that the bill
for foreign oil climbed to $3.69 billion, the highest total in 16
months. The increase resulted from the fourth consecutive monthly
increase in the average price per barrel, which rose to $15.97. The
average price had been $12.42 in November.
   U.S. exports posted across-the-board increases in most
categories. Sales of manufactured capital goods climbed to $10.05
billion, up 8.4 percent from February, while sales of agricultural
products shot up 20.7 percent to $3.36 billion.
   As usual, the biggest deficit was recorded with Japan, a $4.2
billion imbalance, down from a $4.7 billion gap in February. Other
large deficits were recorded with Taiwan, $790 million; South
Korea, $427 million, and Brazil, $341 million.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills must decide by the end of
this month which countries the administration will target for
possible retaliation unless they agree to lower barriers keeping
American goods out. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are the leading
candidates for inclusion on that list.

<HEAD>Soviets Treated to Gorbachev at Great Wall</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet TV viewers were treated Wednesday to
pictures of their president strolling along the Great Wall of China
and joking with young people about Chinese cooking.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to China dominated the state-run
media, taking up all 45 minutes of the evening TV news program
``Vremya'' and most of the first two pages of the government
newspaper Izvestia.
   The coverage continued reports by the official media about the
trip that were unusally lengthy and detailed.
   State-run TV showed Gorbachev's speech to Chinese intellectuals
before its evening news program, and his news conference in Beijing
after the news was over, giving viewers several hours of virtually
uninterrupted coverage of Gorbachev's visit.
   Many of the images of Gorbachev at the Great Wall showed him
talking to young people. Students are at the heart of a protests
that coincide with Gorbachev's visit that have turned into the
largest display of defiance of authorities in 40 years of communist
power.
   Official Soviet TV did not show pictures of demonstrators on
Beijing's Tiananmen Square as it did on Monday night.
   In the TV report, Gorbachev said repeatedly he was impressed by
the desire of Chinese youth for better relations with the Soviet
Union.
   The Soviet leader has been careful in his public statements not
to get into the middle of the dispute between student-led
protesters and the Chinese government that has forced several
changes in his schedule.
   ``This has been preserved not only among the old, but the young
as well. This is very important,'' Gorbachev told a Soviet TV
interview. ``This is my strongest impression.''
   At one point, talking with Chinese young people at the Great
Wall, Gorbachev reached out to hug a young woman. At another point,
talking about Chinese food, he said: ``It is said Chinese cooking
is some of the best in the world. Now I can confirm that.''
   Gorbachev said he hoped Chinese students would once again come
to Moscow to study, as they had done before the rift between the
communist giants that he is trying to mend with his visit.
   Izvestia said Gorbachev's meeting with senior Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping was an historic occasion.
   ``From this day a new stage of Soviet-Chinese relations is
beginning,'' Izvestia's evening edition said in its lead article.
   ``There was practically full agreement in this historic
conversation in relation to new political thinking and new
international political order,'' Izvestia said.
   Asked by the TV interviewer if he thought the Soviet Union and
China would begin to compete instead of cooperate in economic
relations, Gorbachev said he saw great promise for cooperation with
China in energy, transportation, light industry and other economic
spheres.
   The news broadcast also carried Gorbachev's interview with
Chinese TV, and reports on the activities of his wife, Raisa, and
of Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir won Parliament's
approval for his peace plan Wednesday, overcoming a challenge from
lawmakers in his right-wing Likud bloc who said it could help
create a Palestinian state.
   The vote in Parliament, after more than seven hours of sometimes
bitter debate, was 43 in favor and 15 against, with 11 abstaining.
But 51 legislators were absent, including some Likud members who
walked out before the vote of confidence was called.
   Likud dissidents included Industry Minister Ariel Sharon and
Economy Minister Yitzhak Modai, who has called on Shamir to resign.
   In the occupied territories, two Palestinians were killed
Wednesday and at least 14 were wounded, Arab hospital officials
said.
   Ala Jibril, 15, died of a gunshot wound to the head in Askar
refugee camp on the West Bank, the Arab report said.
   The army said Omar Abu Jaber, 41, died of a bullet in the chest
in nearby Jenin, but it added that no troops were operating there.
Israel Radio said an Israeli civilian may have shot Jaber. An army
spokesman confirmed five wounded and said it was checking the other
casualty reports.
   Wednesday's deaths brought the toll to 481 Palestinians killed
since Arabs began revolting 17 months ago against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Twenty-one Israelis
also have been killed in the uprising, which Shamir is trying to
end with a plan calling for Palestinians to elect representatives
to negotiate a limited autonomy.
   Gaza's 700,000 residents were confined to their homes for a
third day as Israeli police continued a sweep of Israeli markets
and factories, forcing home all Gazan Arabs.
   The loss of wages could cause severe hardships for 50,000 Gaza
residents who work in Israel and have few job opportunities at
home. Some Israeli industries that depend on Arab labor already
have sought permission to import workers from abroad.
   Shmuel Goren, coordinator for the occupied lands, told a
parliamentary committee Wednesday that Gazans will not be allowed
to return to Israel without special permits, Army Radio reported.
He said the permits also would be issued to 60,000 West Bankers
employed in Israel.
   Goren said some 28,000 Gazans with criminal records would not
get permits, the radio said. It was unclear if this included
Palestinians jailed without charge for anti-Israeli activities such
as organizing protests.
   In presenting his peace proposal, Shamir played down its
rejection by leading Palestinians who charge it is a ploy to cheat
them out of a Palestinian state.
   The plan rules out participation by the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which is outlawed in Israel but which many
Palestinians consider their rightful representative.
   ``From the Arab side, there have been voices of refusal and
rejection,'' Shamir said. ``We do not think these voices are the
final word.''
   Among opposing legislators was Geula Cohen of the extreme-right
Tehiya party, who warned of a backlash in Israel.
   ``If you fail to see the writing on the wall, then there will be
an uprising that will force you, Mr. Prime Minister, to bring an
entirely new proposal,'' she said. ``This uprising will be without
stones, but it will also be without gloves.''
   At a Likud meeting before the vote, opponents argued the plan
paves the way for the creation of a Palestinian state.
   ``The initiative states that we shall negotiate with any Arab
who is elected,'' said legislator Pessah Grupper. ``This is leading
toward negotiations with the PLO.''
   Shamir assured them that Palestinians ``involved in PLO activity
will not be able to run in elections or vote.''

<TEXT>
   In a sign of the changing mood in Europe, a
top Polish official said Wednesday his government would not object
to the reunification of Germany as long as Poland's borders were
guaranteed.
   ``We feel that European security systems can change, whereas the
basis for security arangements being based on respect for integrity
is unchangeable,'' said Jozef Czyrek, the No. 2 official in the
Polish Communist Party.
   Czyrek also said in an interview with The Asociated Press that
two Soviet regiments were being withdrawn from Poland and that he
envisions a day when all of Moscow's troops leave.
   He also expressed hope that President Bush, scheduled to visit
Poland this July, would issue a reciprocal invitation to Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski, who declared martial law in 1981 but is now
guiding his nation toward democratic elections in June. Czyrek met
with Bush at the White House Monday.
   Jaruzelski is expected to remain Poland's president after the
elections and Czyrek has been mentioned widely as Jaruzelski's
successor as first secretary of the Polish United Workers', or
Communist, Party.
   The changes in the Soviet Union and tentative steps that Poland
and Hungary have taken toward democracy have prompted speculation
that the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty
Alliance could play a diminished security role in Europe, and that
East and West Germany, divided during the Cold War, might
ultimately reunite.
   The German invasion of Poland 50 years ago triggered World War
II. Since the war, Poland has expressed reservations about the
reunification of East and West Germany.
   Czyrek, by contrast, expressed cautious acceptance of eventual
German reunification.
   ``All the processes which would include that security, Poland
would support. At this point in time, Poland has good relations
with the GDR (German Democratic Republic or East Germany) and tries
to improve its relations with Western Germany,'' said Czyrek.
   ``At this point in time, European security is based on
territorial integrity, a respect for territorial integrity and the
shape of Europe as a result of the Second World War, and
developments after the Second World War,'' he said.
   A Polish government aide later said that Czyrek's formulation
marked a change in the official stance.
   ``Our position used to be'' in non-diplomatic terms, ``that we
liked Germany so much that we wanted to see two of them,'' said the
Polish government source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The United States views possible reunification as an issue to be
decided by the German people, although U.S. officials say they
worry what would happen if West Germany left NATO.
   Asked whether Poland would view a unified Germany as a threat,
Czyrek said:
   ``A nation that does not take its historical experience into
consideration puts itself in danger. That applies to Poland also.
We do not forget our experiences. Obviously, it has an influence in
shaping our attitude towards Germany. We are not closing our eyes
to the future.''
   Czyrek also said that within the last few days, Polish and
Soviet officials had agreed that two regiments of Soviet troops
would be withdrawn from Poland.
   The Soviet Union maintains 40,000 soldiers in Poland, according
to the Institute for International and Strategic Studies in London.
Most of those are logistical support troops for the estimated
380,000 Soviet soldiers in East Germany, said Czyrek, but he was
unable to say precisely how many Soviet troops were being pulled
out.
   Czyrek, asked whether he foresaw the day that all Soviet troops
would go home, replied:
   ``Surely I do. Is that so difficult to imagine?''
   David Isby, an expert on the Soviet military, said the average
Soviet tank regiment has 95 to 100 tanks and 1,575 people.

<HEAD>`Junk Fax' Gets Regulatory Attention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER PETTERSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Facsimile machines are proliferating and with them come
unsolicited fax ads and messages, but already one state has banned
``junk fax'' _ after the governor's machine was clogged with
messages protesting fax legislation.
   A second governor annoyed by a fax blast urging rejection of a
fax regulation bill is considering signing the law. Several other
states are weighing similar measures.
   One bill sponsor, Maryland state Delegate Gilbert J. Genn, said
opposition comes from direct-mail and electronic marketing firms,
which frequently are armed with fax telephone number lists and
automatic dialing machines.
   ``You can almost imagine the havoc that this could wreak,'' Genn
said.
   A spokesman for the group that sparked the blizzard of fax
messages to the two governors said Wednesday he never expected so
many responses.
   Fax machines, which can send a page of text or illustration over
telephone lines in about a minute, are used for everything from
sending documents between lawyers and zapping news releases to the
media to getting in a speedy order to the sandwich shop.
   Before Lucille Ball's death last month, the machine at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center churned out get-well messages virtually
nonstop, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise. ``I am completely
convinced the fax machine is destined to become the Hallmark card
of the '90s,'' Wise said.
   But uninvited advertising can tie up the receiving machine and
use up its expensive special paper.
   On Tuesday, five days after his machine was deluged with
messages urging him to veto a bill banning unsolicited fax
messages, an annoyed Connecticut Gov. William A. O'Neill signed the
measure into law.
   ``I had been following discussion about the legislation,''
O'Neill said, ``but frankly, last week was the first time the need
for this kind of legislation was brought home to me.''
   The messages O'Neill received came from businesses that had
received ``fax fliers'' from the National Fax Users Committee of
Mission Viejo, Calif.
   Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer received 343 fax messages
last week after the group faxed fliers to Maryland businesses to
relay to him. He won't decide to sign or veto until Tuesday.
   ``If we had any important messages coming in we wouldn't have
been able to get them through,'' said David S. Iannucci, the
governor's lobbyist.
   Connecticut's new law allows people receiving unsolicited fax
messages to seek up to $200 in damages. Maryland's bill would
impose fines up to $1,000.
   The National Fax Users Committee ``is just a very loose group of
fax users,'' Elliott Segal said Wednesday. He described himself as
``kind of a point man, I guess'' for the group.
   Segal, vice president of marketing for an Irvine, Calif.,
company that sells fax paper and advertises by faxing messages to
500,000 machine users, said the deluge that O'Neill received was
``a very unfortunate situation.''
   ``How would we have anticipated that this many responses would
have been generated?'' he said.
   Donna Murdoch, executive director of the American Fascimile
Association in Philadelphia, said the group doesn't think
advertising by fax works anyway _ ``unless you're selling fax
paper.'' Her group estimates there are 3 million fax machines in
this country.
   Segal's group isn't alone in getting state officials' attention.
   New York state consumer protection chief Richard Kessel said he
was about to send an important memo to Gov. Mario Cuomo when his
machine spit out a three-page menu from a sandwich shop. Now New
York legislators are considering banning junk fax.
   ``The last thing you want when you're trying to meet a deadline,
or trying to get a memo in to your boss ... is to be disturbed by
someone trying to sell draperies or submarine sandwiches,'' Kessel
said.
   Ohio state Rep. Otto Beatty last month introduced a bill to ban
fax ads. He said he was irritated when an ad for men's clothing
appeared on his law office machine, interrupting an exchange of
documents during a business negotiation.
   Washington state Rep. Ken Jacobsen, who introduced a bill
against junk fax, said of the issue: ``This is the ultimate in
abusive use of a private communication system. You get a message
you didn't want from people you don't know on paper they didn't
buy.''

<HEAD>Robespierre's Annotated Copy of Constitution At Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The revolutionary leader Robespierre's own draft of
France's first constitution goes on the auction block next month
along with other documents from the bloody events of 200 years ago.
   The 57-page manuscript, to be sold June 12 by Paris auctioneer
Jacques Tajan, contains countless annotations in Maximilien
Robespierre's own hand on various aspects of the first constitution
prepared in 1791 by the National Assembly.
   Bound in fine red Moroccan leather, its value is estimated at
$66,000.
   The sale also features documents from the King Luois XVI's trial
and a letter written on Oct. 10, 1789, by Queen Marie Antoinette to
the Austrian ambassador in Paris describing her departure from the
palace at Versailles four days earlier.
   ``Despite all the nasty things that people continue to do to me,
I am well,'' the queen wrote to Mecy-Argenteau, her close friend
and confident.
   The letter is estimated at about $10,000.
   Known as the ``Incorruptible,'' Robespierre was responsible for
sending some 17,000 people to the guillotine during the year-long
Reign of Terror, which climaxed with his own beheading in 1794.
   The notes show he was obsessed with power. He believed in a
strong central authority and was against the creation of a
legislative branch composed of representatives elected by the
people for brief periods of time.
   His notes also condemn the National Assembly's plan to limit the
vote to those paying taxes worth three days' work.
   ``Wealth corrupts more than poverty,'' Robespierre wrote in the
margin of the text. ``Millionaires are the ones who should be
excluded'' from voting.

<HEAD>Report Says World Tensions Eased a Bit Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World tensions eased somewhat last
year, but more developing nations acquired ballistic missiles,
which can carry nuclear warheads, disarmament researchers said
Wednesday.
   The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said truces
ended five wars in 1988, cutting the number of active conflicts
from 33 to 28.
   ``There was a clear break in the constant increase in ... major
conflicts to which the world had grown accustomed during the
1980s,'' said the institute's 1988 yearbook.
   But, the report said an alarming 24 developing nations obtained
or were trying to obtain ballistic missiles. Many of them have
refused to sign the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
   Cease-fires halted the Iran-Iraq war, the conflict between
Ethiopia and Somalia, the war between Chad and Libya and battles
within Angola and Namibia, it said. Tensions eased in seven other
conflicts, although fighting grew fiercer in many other regional or
civil wars, said the 530-page report.
   The institute, an independent group funded mainly by the Swedish
parliament, tracks developments in weapons trading and arms
control. Its yearbook has become a standard reference on these
issues.
   Institute director, Walter Stuetzle, blamed the United States
for failing to respond to disarmament challenges offered by Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, and urged the administration to hasten
negotiations.
   Stuetzle said the spread of ballistic missiles capable of
carrying nuclear or chemical warheads was alarming.
   ``The proliferation of nuclear weapons is a larger problem than
ever before,'' said Stuetzle, a former West German undersecretary
of defense. ``This is nothing to be proud of 19 years after the
non-proliferation treaty.''
   Seventeen nations have deployed ballistic missiles, and about
500 may have been fired last year in the Iran-Iraq war, the report
said.
   Stuetzle said Israel has the most advanced ballistic missile
force outside of the five major nuclear powers, including a 1,760
pound artillery rocket that is the largest anywhere.
   Argentina, Brazil, India, North Korea and Taiwan also make their
own missiles, the report said. Saudi Arabia last year bought
Chinese-made CSS-2 systems, which are the most powerful missiles
found in the Third World, the report said.
   But worldwide defense spending declined last year. Among the 16
NATO members, the total defense budget dropped by 3 percent last
year.
   ``Finance ministers are winning over the defense ministers,''
the report said.
   And the United States is paying less for Europe's defense than
it claims, the report said, estimating that about 15 percent of
U.S. defense spending was directly related to North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, or about 0.9 percent of gross domestic product.
   The report also said the international trade in conventional
weapons dropped slightly to $34 billion.
   The Soviet Union and the United States were the largest
suppliers, responsible for 66 percent of the world market. India
was the largest buyer, followed by Iraq, North Korea, Saudi Arabia
and Afghanistan, the report said.

   A tornado ravaged a small town near Austin and rescuers plucked
residents from trees, homes and cars in the flood-stricken Dallas
area as Texas bore the brunt of severe storms that soaked the
Southwest and Northeast on Wednesday.
   Elsewhere, rivers and creeks overflowed their banks in New
Jersey after two days of record heavy rain, chasing dozens of
people from their homes.
   The weather claimed at least three lives in Texas.
   The pre-dawn tornado cut a swath seven miles long and a mile
wide through Jarrell, killing one person and injuring at least two
dozen. Fifteen homes and an apartment complex were destroyed in the
town of 1,000 people 40 miles from Austin.
   ``All we have left is our lives,'' said W.G. Schurhammer, whose
apartment building was destroyed.
   ``I was up, watching the storm. I heard a lightning bolt. It was
like hell, that's what it was like,'' said Jerry Waters, who lived
in the building.
   Sheriff Jim Boutwell said it appeared that more than one tornado
touched down because there were some parallel areas of damage.
   A 42-year-old woman died of a broken neck when the tornado hit
her mobile home, which Boutwell said ``practically exploded.''
Hospitals in Georgetown and Temple reported 24 people sought
treatment.
   Kelly Reichenbach said he and his wife, Earline, and their
1-year-old son, Kyle, dived for cover in the hallway of their home
when they heard the wind roaring.
   ``Your main concern was trying to find out what was landing on
top of you,'' said Reichenbach, who received stitches in his leg
for a gash caused by falling debris. ``There were wires on us. We
just pushed them off.''
   Floodwaters in the Dallas area, which got nearly six inches of
rain in less than 24 hours, sent hundreds of residents to shelters.
Police, firefighters and others rescued scores of people from cars,
homes and in one case, a tree.
   ``I've been standing in water up to my elbows for the last
couple hours trying to get a couple gals out of a tree,'' said
Kennedale Police Chief David Geeslin.
   He said the women had been stuck in the tree for eight hours
after their car was washed off the roadway.
   Another rescue attempt ended in tragedy. Firefighters, secured
with ropes strung to telephone poles, spent 2{ hours trying to
reach a woman whose car was swept off a bridge into a Dallas creek.
The woman waited atop the car.
   ``The car started rocking and she got back into the car and at
that time the car fell into the creek. It floated for a few minutes
and went down,'' said firefighter Dennis Ground. Her body was found
a half-mile away.
   In suburban Grand Prairie, the body of an elderly man was
recovered from a truck in a creek, said police Lt. James Gatlin.
   A Kennedale city councilman used his boat to rescue a man who
had gone to check his cattle and became trapped by rising waters,
Geeslin said.
   From 150 to 200 people were evacuated from the Five Mile Creek
area, 50 people from Grand Prairie, and 125 to 150 people from
Kennedale, police said.
   Flood warnings went up in northern New Jersey on Wednesday.
Dozens of peole were forced from their homes because of rising
water on the Passaic River.
   Newark got .71 inches of rain Wednesday and 2.11 inches on
Tuesday, breaking records that had stood for up to 49 years.
   Elsewhere, Baltimore-Washington International Airport endured
its 13th straight day of rain, the longest such stretch in 40 years
of record keeping there. The old record for May was nine days, set
in 1979.

   An undiplomatic wrangle over three of President
Bush's diplomatic nominees broke out in the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Wednesday.
   When it ended, the prospects were that two appointees would face
lengthy delays and perhaps prolonged Senate debate.
   And one had received the verbal equivalent of having his mouth
washed out with soap.
   The three nominations that caused the problems: Richard R. Burt,
to be the new U.S. strategic arms negotiator; Donald Gregg, to be
ambassador to South Korea; and Reter V. Secchia, to be ambassador
to Italy.
   The situation:
   _Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., accuses Burt of leaking classified
information to a female journalist with whom Burt says he once had
a ``social relationship.'' Helms vows to delay action on the Senate
floor pending a State Department investigation. Sen. Joseph R.
Biden, D-Del., defended Burt saying he ``broke no law.'' The
committee eventually endorsed the nomination _ 14-2.
   _Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., says he is prepared for lengthy
and investigative hearings into Gregg's alleged involvement in the
Iran-Contra affair unless President Bush withdraws the nomination
of the man who was his vice presidential national security adviser.
   _Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., says he fears that Secchia, a
former Michigan Republican national committeeman, will be ``an
embarrassment to the administration and the United States'' as
ambassador to Italy because of a ``penchant for making gross
remarks'' in public.
   But Pell, who said Italian friends were ``aghast'' at the
choice, said he would not block action. The committee sent the
nomination to the Senate, 11-0.
   Cranston _ who opposes Gregg and supports Burt _ and Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C. _ who opposes Burt and supports Gregg _ accused each
other, in effect, of holding's each other's candidate hostage.
   Helms said Cranston has launched ``a fishing expedition'' to
uncover adverse information against Gregg, a 30-year veteran of the
CIA.
   ``You swore him in as if he was some sort of culprit, which he
is not,'' Helms complained. ``You hope to be able to milk the
Iran-Contra cow again''
   Cranston said his concerns revolve around the nominee's
``credibility and judgment'' and whether or not he had misled the
Congress by denying any knowlege of the covert resupply of
Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   ``I have no intention of dragging out this matter at any great
length, but I think we do not yet have full information.'' Cranston
replied.
   ``As far as I'm concerned you didn't catch a thing,'' Helms
asserted.
   Cranston then spelled out a series of events that began with
Gregg's introduction of former intelligence operative Felix
Rodriguez in December 1984 to Oliver L. North, then a member of the
staff of the National Security Council. Cranston said the eveznts
and documentary evidence strongly indicate that Gregg may well
known that Rodriguez had been deeply involved in the illegal
resupply of the Contras.
   The possibility also is posed, Cranston said, that Gregg
deliberately misled the congressional Iran-Contra investigating
Committee when asked about his alleged involvement in the affair as
well as the Foreign Relations panel.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., defended Gregg and declared: ``Don
Gregg did not want to slink off into the shadows and hide, he
wanted to be named to a position subject to confirmation so he
could put this thing to rest. If either he or the president had
anything to hide, the president would never have sent this
nomination up here.''
   Helms then counterattacked.
   ``If you hold this up, I've (also) got a nominee about which
information has come in,'' Helms said. ``He's the darling of your
side of the aisle _ Richard Burt.''
   Helms served notice he would delay the Burt nomination on the
Senate floor and appeared to link its fate to that of the Gregg
nomination.
   He repeated allegations that Burt had abused his security
clearance in various State Department positions and had published
classified information in his previous career as journalist.
   He said Burt's alleged actions violated federal law, ``which is
what this is, a crime,'' he said.
   Biden disagreed, saying Burt had ``broken no law.''
   Pell pressed for a committee vote, but that was delayed.

<TEXT>
   Congressmen on Wednesday issued the formal
report of an anti-smoking conference as part of a bid for support
for a variety of anti-tobacco measures including a tax increase and
restrictions on cigarette advertising.
   ``While we are gaining on some fronts, we are losing the battle
with our children,'' said Rep. Michael A. Andrews, D-Texas, lead
organizer of the conference held in Texas. ``Each year, a million
young people start smoking.''
   Among the co-sponsors of the conference Jan. 27-28 in Houston
was the Coalition On Smoking Or Health _ comprised of the American
Cancer Society, the American Heart Association and the American
Lung Association _ and the American Medical Association.
   Scott Ballin, chairman of the coalition and vice president for
public affairs of the American Heart Association, said the
conference report ``strengthens the advocacy campaign of the
tobacco-control movement'' and also supports the legislative agenda
announced by the coalition at the start of the current Congress.
   Among the recommendations of the January conference:
   _The Food and Drug Administration should be given some authority
over all tobacco products. Under present law, the FDA does not
regulate tobacco use because it does not meet the legal definition
of food or drug.
   _Tobacco advertising must be restricted to eliminate its
influence on children.
   _Excise taxes on tobacco products should be increased.
   _The federal tobacco price support program should be eliminated.
   _Non-smokers should have legal protection from having to inhale
the smoke of others in airplanes, all public places and in the
workplace.
   _The federal government should stop encouraging the export of
U.S. tobacco to other countries.
   Ballin noted that the coalition has been working ``with key
members of Congress to put the conference's recommendations into
action'' since they were issued made in January.
   Among bills being pushed are two separate proposals to boost the
16-cent-per-pack cigarette tax _ one by 22 cents and one by 25
cents.
   Also pending are at least 13 other bills that would _ in one way
or another _ restrict the use, sale and advertising of tobacco.

   Some residents have found out that being a
fan of TV actor Lee Majors is enough to keep them out of the jury
box.
   ``I'm afraid I would be prejudiced because I'm a fan of Mr.
Majors,'' Ernest Werner said Tuesday during jury selection for
trial on a lawsuit the actor filed against an Enid oil and gas
producer.
   Werner was dismissed, but numerous other fans of Majors, star of
``The Fall Guy,'' The Six-Million Dollar Man'' and ``The Big
Valley,'' lingered near the courtroom.
   Majors and Enid businessman Ray Davis are seeking about $3
million in damages from oil and gas producers Vaughn and Laura
Good, claiming money they invested was misused.
   Lawyers for the Goods allege Majors and Davis sued because of
``sour grapes'' over the drop in oil prices.

<TEXT>
   Four senators proposed Wednesday to ban use of
the chemical Alar on apples and other agricultural products and
said they expected fast floor action on their measure.
   ``The train is under way,'' Sen. John Warner, R-Va., told a news
conference called to unveil an Alar ban he said would benefit
producers as well as consumers. He indicated he would move to
bypass committee action and attach the bill as an amendment to
legislation ripe for quick floor action.
   The bill would reduce to zero the amount of the growth-enhancing
chemical that could be used on apples and other crops, primarily
grapes, cherries and peanuts. The ban would be effective as soon as
signed by the president.
   Alar, which enhances the appearance of apples and keeps them
fresh longer, has also been identified as a cancer-causing agent in
laboratory animals.
   Despite initial assessments from the Environmental Protection
Agency that Alar does not constitute a health risk for consumers,
apples sales have plunged since disclosures that the chemical,
manufactured by Uniroyal, is widely used.
   Apple producers are facing a $100 million loss ``on the raw
crop'' this year as a result of unfavorable reports about Alar and
there has been an additional 30 percent drop in apple juice sales,
according to Derl I. Derr, president of the International Apple
Institute, based in McLean, Va.
   Derr said his group, composed of 23 state organizations
representing an estimated 90 percent of the nation's 15,000
commercial growers, favors taking Alar off the market, but not by
legislative means. He said reducing the allowable amount to zero
would require an EPA finding that Alar poses an ``imminent hazard.''
   ``And if you think we have a bad market now, you should see what
it would be like then,'' Derr said. He said his organization is
urging growers to stop using the compound and hoping Uniroyal will
voluntarily halt sales.
   On Monday, Derr said that ``by September of this year, the
already low levels of Alar will be reduced to virtually zero.
Simply, the U.S. apple industry is not going to use Alar.''
   The Environmental Protection Agency estimated in March that Alar
was being used on just 10 percent of the nation's apple supply and
it was starting a procedure that could lead to a ban on the
chemical in 18 months.
   The Senate bill would affect only food crops and would allow
continued use of Alar on commercially produced flowers.
   None of the measure's sponsors is a member of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, which for years has proven an obstacle to
tough farm chemical regulations recommended by environmentalists
and consumer advocates.
   Similar legislation was quietly introduced in the House earlier
this year, although no action has been taken on it.
   Senators at the news conference said there was no time to lose
in clamping down on the chemical.
   ``If we do not ban Alar from the market, American consumers, in
increasing numbers, will ban apples from their diet,'' declared
Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., called the measure ``a major step in
the right direction, but no one should fool themselves into
thinking that this action eliminates the danger of pesticides for
American consumers.''
   ``There are 50,000 other pesticides out there,'' he said.
   ``If our children are at risk,'' said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich., ``it is our responsibility to alleviate the risk right
now.''

   Iran on Wednesday hanged 13 people
convicted of drug trafficking, Tehran radio reported.
   The men smuggled 1,250 pounds of narcotics into Tehran,
according to the broadcast, which was monitored in Nicosia. Some
also were convicted on charges of smuggling arms, illegal
possession of weapons and illegal entry into the country, the radio
said.
   Wednesday's hangings raised to 605 the number of drug
traffickers executed since a new anti-narcotics law went into
effect in January. The law mandates the death penalty for anyone

<HEAD>Western Water Supplies Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospects for summer water supplies in much of
the West declined last month because of below-average precipitation
and early snow melt, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   ``Warm temperatures and sunny skies throughout the West in April
caused snowpack to melt sooner than usual for the month,'' said
Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation Service.
   April precipitation was below average or well-below average
throughout the region except in the Pacific Northwest and Montana,
he said. Consequently, seasonal forecasts have been reduced in most
basin areas.
   ``Early runoff improved reservoir storage dramatically,''
Scaling said. ``However, inflows have already begun to taper off in
many basins.''
   April precipitation was less than 50 percent of average in the
Southwest, except for pockets of above-average precipitation in
southern Arizona, southeastern New Mexico and central Colorado.
   Streamflow forecasts have been reduced throughout the West
through September, Scaling said. However, near-average flows are
expected for most rivers in Oregon, as well as for the Upper
Columbia, the Upper Snake and along the mainstem of the Yellowstone
River.
   Nevada is the only state where reservoir storage is well-below
average, he said. Summer inflows to reservoirs are likely to be
below-average in all Western states.
   The West depends on snow melt for about 75 percent of its water
supply.

<DATELINE>KWANGJU, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of protesters
chanting ``Down with the dictatorship!'' Wednesday demanded the
overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo and protested the violent
suppression of a May 18, 1980 uprising.
   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' was the cry from about 50,000 students,
workers and townspeople who marched through Kwangju, a city 168
miles south of Seoul.
   Thousands of students led the procession, waving red, blue and
yellow streamers and placards and accusing police of torturing a
student to death earlier this month.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo who committed murder and torture!''
screamed protesters who also demanded ``Yankees Go Home!'' They
accused the United States of ``patronizing the Roh regime.''
   Also Wednesday, the official Yonhap news agency reported
thousands of students staged peaceful campus protests in seven
other cities over the death of radical student Lee Chol-kyu.
   Thousands of people have protested daily in Kwangju since Lee's
body was found May 10 in a reservoir near the city. Police had
sought the student for anti-government acts.
   Government officials say Lee appears to have fallen into the
reservoir after fleeing from police who stopped him at a checkpoint.
   Speakers at a Wednesday rally in Kwangju called for a continued
campaign to end military rule in South Korea.
   ``Let's punish Roh and expel the Yankees forever by inheriting
the will of the patriot, Lee Chol-kyu,'' one dissident leader said.
The crowd responded with slogans demanding an independent
investigation into Lee's death.
   Police stayed away from the rally in an apparent move to avoid
clashes, but a spokesman said 7,000 riot policemen were on standby.
   The police are on a nationwide alert to block possible protests
marking the ninth anniversary of the nine-day civil uprising in
Kwangju in which at least 192 people were killed.
   Dissidents say Roh, a former general, is a front for military
rule and accuse him of helping his disgraced predecessor, Chun
Doo-hwan, to suppress the pro-democracy revolt.
   Government officials say they deployed troops as a last resort
to end an armed rebellion.
   The dissidents claim Chun and other army officers provoked the
uprising to seize power. They also say the United States condoned
Chun's actions _ a charge Washington denies.
   Chun went into rural exile last November after making a public
apology for misdeeds under his seven-year authoritarian rule.
Opposition parties want Chun to testify before the National
Assembly.
   South Korea has experienced a wave of violent anti-government
and anti-American protests and labor strikes in recent months.
   Roh ordered a crackdown on dissidents after six riot policemen
died in a May 3 campus clash.
   Dissidents and radical students have been calling for Roh's
overthrow, but they lack support because of their violent tactics
and extremist views.
   They also do not have the support of most South Koreans in their
demands for the withdrawal of about 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in
their country under a mutual defense pact.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors on Wednesday interrogated two
politicians suspected of taking bribes in an influence-peddling
scandal that has shaken public trust in Japanese politics.
   They were the first elected officials questioned in the Recruit
scandal, in which 14 bureaucrats and businessmen were arrested on
charges of bribery or securities law violations.
   Prosecutors said Takao Fujinami, chief Cabinet secretary under
former former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, and Katsuya Ikeda,
a legislator from the opposition Komeito Party, each were
questioned for about 12 hours.
   The two are suspected of accepting bribes in return for helping
the Recruit Co. in its employment information business.
   Under Japanese legal custom, summonses for interrogation are
regarded as an equivalent to arrest.
   Ikeda, 51, said Tuesday that he would resign his Parliament
seat. Ruling party officials denied reports that Fujinami, 56,
would resign, but indicated he might have to do so if he is
formally charged.
   Also on Wednesday, Komeito chairman Junya Yano became the third
party leader to step down in the scandal. He follows Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita, who is resigning as head of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party _ and thus as prime minister _ and Saburo
Tsukamoto, who stepped down in February as head of the opposition
Democratic Socialist Party.
   Ruling party leaders still are trying to find a new prime
minister who is untainted by the scandal.
   ``People hope that the prosecutors will go to the center of
Nakasone administration,'' said Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general
of the Japan Socialist Party.
   News reports Tuesday said Nakasone would be willing to testify
in Parliament concerning his links to Recruit. His refusal to
testify in past months contributed to an opposition boycott of
parliamentary business.
   Aides to Nakasone were among some 160 politicians, bureaucrats
and businessmen who bought bargain-priced unlisted shares in a
Recruit subsidiary and made large profits when the price soared
after public trading began.
   Of 17 politicians linked to purchases of Recruit shares, 11 were
members of the Cabinet of Nakasone, who was prime minister at the
time of the share transactions.
   A share transaction handled by Fujinami's secretary brought
profits of about $191,000, prosecutors said. Ikeda's brother,
Yuzuru, earned about $73,530 on Recruit share transactions, and
news reports say 70 percent of that went into Ikeda's own bank
account.
   Ikeda repeatedly raised questions in Parliament that prosecutors
say were helpful to Recruit.
   Komeito leaders held an emergency meeting and Chairman Yano
later told reporters that he believed Ikeda's statement that he was
innocent of wrongdoing. But the Komeito chairman said public trust
in the party had been impaired and said he had resigned.
   Yano himself is under fire for links to an earlier scandal
involving transactions.

<HEAD>Bennett Asks Pro Sports Officials for Tough, Uniform Drug Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GINSBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug Policy Coordinator William J. Bennett
told sports commissioners and player representatives Wednesday they
should set a single, tough drug policy for the pro athletes who set
examples for America's youth.
   Participants said the give-and-take with Bennett was useful, but
most said adoption of a uniform drug policy for major professional
sports was unlikely.
   ``It's far-fetched to believe that we can all agree'' on such a
policy, said Gene Upshaw, head of the National Football League
Players Association.
   While Bennett expressed a strong desire that the commissioners
toughen their stand on drug use in sports, he stopped short of
pressing the leagues to randomly test athletes for drugs.
   ``Surprisingly, he was not in there mandating that we have
random testing,'' Upshaw said. ``That was music to my ears.''
   All that may change, however, when the group convenes again this
summer.
   ``We didn't talk about random testing today, but we might talk
about that next time,'' Bennett said. ``We'll get into specifics at
the next meeting.''
   No policies were put in place Wednesday, but Bennett expressed
hope that concrete ideas might come out of the follow-up meeting.
   ``Most important, we have agreed to meet again this summer, in a
month or two, so we can have some specific suggestions for the
national strategy which I am writing,'' Bennett said.
   Among those at the meeting were commissioners Pete Rozelle of
the National Football League, David Stern of the National
Basketball Association and A. Bartlett Giamatti of major league
baseball.
   Steve Ryan, senior vice president for marketing and public
relations for the National Hockey League, was also present.
   Bennett, the top federal official in the fight against illegal
drugs, said he spent much of the 90-minute meeting exchanging ideas
with sports officials on ways to improve anti-drug standards in
general as well as for pro sports. While he listened to their
advice, he also made suggestions.
   ``I told them that professional sports has to be part of the
solution,'' Bennett said. ``The question I put to the group is,
`While we are pressing very hard on schools and others to have
tough policies, it seems only right that professional sports have
those kind of standards.'''
   Bennett said he was interested in getting the opinions of
high-ranking sports officials because most athletes are considered
role models by children.
   ``Pro sports play an important part in American life,'' Bennett
said. ``If they are so important, and they do have such a hold on
the American imagination, then this ought to be the focal point of
our effort.''
   Giamatti said, ``Pro sports has in place programs which, if not
perfect, are real comprehensive and, I think, he found
interesting.''
   Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball
Players Association, said, ``Hopefully we were able to begin to
acquaint the secretary with the kinds of problems we've had and the
successes and the failures we went through in trying to solve
them.''

<HEAD>US Confirms Gorbachev Pledge But Says Other Arms Still Reaching Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Wednesday that the
``pattern of delivery'' of Soviet bloc weapons shipments to
Nicaragua had not changed even after Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's agreement to stop sending Soviet arms to the Sandinista
government.
   What's more, department spokesman Richard Boucher said, the
Soviets themselves continue to send other military equipment to
Nicaragua.
   Responding to persistent U.S. appeals for a cut-off in support
to the Sandinistas, who are battling American-backed Contra
insurgents, Gorbachev wrote Bush earlier this month that he had
suspended Soviet weapons shipments on Jan. 1 and would not resume
them.
   But U.S. officials told The Associated Press Monday that the
Soviet leader had declined to end other military support, such as
vehicles, and would not impede Cuban deliveries of weapons to
Nicaragua.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Tuesday dismissed
Gorbachev as a ``drugstore cowboy,'' suggesting there was more show
than substance in his letter to Bush.
   Other U.S. officials passed the word to reporters that 17
shipments of military goods had reached Nicaragua, but declined to
say whether they came from the Soviet Union, its Eastern European
allies or Cuba, and whether or not weapons were included.
   Then, on Wednesday, the State Department confirmed Gorbachev's
letter _ although insisting that the pattern of Soviet bloc aid to
Nicaragua had not changed. By the department's own account,
however, the Soviets themselves had stopped sending weapons _ as
Gorbachev had told Bush was the case.
   Boucher said that 27 shipments of military goods were sent to
Nicaragua from the Soviet Union and its allies in the first four
months of the year and that the estimated value of shipments
through March was about $80 million.
   Boucher said that over the four-month period arms were supplued
by Eastern European countries and Cuba, with the Soviets providing
unspecificed other military materiel.
   ``The general secretary indicated in his letter that the Soviets
have stopped sending weapons to Nicaragua,'' Boucher said, thereby
confirming Gorbachev's pledge as reported Monday night by The
Washington Post and The Associated Press.
   The spokesman added: ``In sum, the level and pattern of delivery
so far is very siumilar to that of 1988 _ that is, military
supplies delivered by the Soviets and weapons and lethal equipment
delivered by their Cubans and East European clients.''
   In past years, though, the United States said the Soviets were
providing both weapons and other military equipment to Nicaragua.
The aid totaled an estimated $515 million last year.
   Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee chastised the White House for its statements
about Gorbachev and accused administration officials of lacking
``vision'' in meeting the Soviet leader's arms control challenges.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., alluded to statements by Fitzwater.
Besides calling Gorbachev a ``drugstore cowboy,'' the spokesman
said the administration was ``leery'' of the Soviet leader's
promise to halt military aid to Nicaragua.
   ``I don't think you ought to run down the Gorbachev proposals. I
don't think the kind of statements Marlin Fitzwater is making are
helpful,'' Aspin told two administration officials at a hearing by
his committee.
   The administration contends that many of Gorbachev's
initiatives, such as his recent offering to withdraw 500
short-range nuclear weapons from Eastern Europe, have been designed
to glean publicity and were not actually substantial when viewed
against the overwhelming superiority of Warsaw Pact forces in
Europe.
   But Aspin argued that the administration was being outflanked by
the Soviet leader's ability to win the public relations war,
particularly among U.S. allies in Western Europe.
   Aspin and several other Democrats complained to Paul Wolfowitz,
undersecretary of defense for policy, and Reginald Bartholomew,
undersecretary of state for security assistance, that the
administration was losing that fight because it has not responded
swiftly enough to Gorbachev's various arms control proposals, nor
with enough imagination.
   Wolfowitz and Bartholomew countered that the administration was
being cautious in areas where such restraint was deemed as
necessary, and had put forward serious and far-reaching proposals
to trim the conventional forces in Europe, which the Soviets are
now just coming around to meet.

   Oscar-winning composer Marvin Hamlisch
serenaded a group of Democratic senators Wednesday after their
Republican counterparts were pulled away by a White House summons.
   Hamlisch was performing at a reception hosted by Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, to celebrate the musician's upcoming marriage
when the GOP contingent was called away to discuss minimum wage
legislation.
   ``I'm so sorry the president had to blow my little party by
taking all the Republicans,'' said Metzenbaum.
   So while the esteemed senators from the GOP did business at 1600
Pennsylvania Ave., Metzenbaum's Democratic pals enjoyed a bit of
Broadway in a government office building
   Hamlisch and Metzenbaum are longtime friends, and the musician's
fiancee, Terre Blair, hails from Columbus, Ohio.
   That was reason enough for Metzenbaum and his wife Shirley to
have tables, linens, asparagus salad and upright piano moved into
the Democrat's Capitol Hill office for a small celebration with
selected senators and spouses.
   Hamlisch played ``They're Playing My Song'' and Metzenbaum's
favorite Hamlisch composition, ``The Way We Were,'' for which the
composer earned one of his three Academy Awards.
   Hamlisch then asked the senators to call out any phrase so that
he could form a song around the lyric. Uncharacteristically, they
fell silent.
   The future bride, Ms. Blair, 33, said she met Hamlisch on a
blind telephone date set up by her Los Angeles housekeeper and the
housekeeper's New York sister.
   Ms. Blair said she almost didn't return the call when Hamlisch
left his number on her answering machine, but did so at the urging
of a friend.
   Ms. Blair and Hamlisch hit it off over the telephone and fell in
love before they met face-to-face.
   ``We had phone conversations that were incredible _ six and a
half hours long,'' Hamlisch said.
   ``I had no idea what she looked like, but I could tell that she
was a very giving person,'' said Hamlisch, who'll turn 45 a few
days after his May 29 wedding at New York's Tavern On The Green.
``It's really been magical. It's been wonderful.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two firefighters reportedly resigned amid an
investigation into charges they and nine others pretended to be
Hispanic to get preferential hiring treatment.
   Fire Department spokesman Bill Murphy and other city officials
would not confirm the report Wednesday in The Boston Globe.
   City Councilman Bruce Bolling, who called for an investigation
of minority hiring last year, said he could not obtain confirmation
either but that it appeared the probe by the state Personnel
Department was ending successfully.
   ``Hopefully, this chapter in the Boston Fire Department and city
could never be replicated again in terms of someone misrepresenting
themselves and getting away with it,'' Bolling said.
   The investigation began with the case of two fair-skinned
brothers who said they were black and went unchallenged for 10
years. The 33-year-old twins, Paul and Philip Malone, were
suspended without pay in August after officials determined they had
misrepresented their race.
   The Malones have refused to discuss the case on the advice of
their attorneys but told officials that their maternal
great-grandmother was black. A court hearing on their suspension
has been scheduled for next Wednesday.
   The Fire Department had forwarded the names of 11 firefighters
who identified themselves as Hispanic to the state. Officials have
said the 11 were hired between 1976 and 1983 before a screening
process was established in 1984.
   ``If they can substantiate that they in fact are minorities then
that's fine, but to the extent that they can't and they've clearly
misrepresented themselves they've taken an employment opportunity
away from a legitimate minority,'' Bolling said.
   In 1974, a federal court established a preference system for
hiring minorities after finding that Fire Department hiring had
been based on a discriminatory examination.
   At the time, only 19 of more than 2,100 city firefighters were
black or Hispanic. Today, the department is 21 percent black and
Hispanic, compared with 20 percent for the city's population.
   The Globe reported that firefighter Richard L. Pardo resigned
March 31 and Thomas France quit Monday. Pardo hung up when called
by The Associated Press on Wednesday. There was no listing for
France in the Boston telephone directory.

   The Bush administration is expected to name
veteran diplomat William Swing as ambassador to South Africa and
will invite the leader of that nation's ruling party to Washington,
U.S. officials said Wednesday.
   Swing, 54, has previously served as ambassador to the Congo and
Liberia. In South Africa, he would replace Ambassador Edward
Perkins, who is returning home to become director general of the
Foreign Service. Swing is now deputy director in that office.
   The U.S. officials, insisting on anonymity, also said Bush is
expected to name conservative columnist Smith Hempstone as
ambassador to Kenya.
   The Nairobi post had been expected to go to career diplomat
Princeton Lyman, now ambassador to Nigeria, but the administration
decided to send a political appointee to Kenya, the officials said.
   Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration would invite the leader of South Africa's ruling
National Party, Frederick W. de Klerk, to visit.
   De Klerk is expected to succeed South Africa President P.W.
Botha once parliamentary elections are held in September.
   Asked about such a visit, State Department deputy spokesman
Richard Boucher said the United States is in touch with the South
African government ``regarding possible meetings and
consultations'' with de Klerk.
   He said the administration is planning to consult widely with
both black and white South Africans and to solicit viewpoints
across the South African political spectrum.
   More than 30 years have passed since a South African president,
prime minister or National Party leader has come to the United
States.
   A commentary aired on South Africa's state-run radio, reported
in Wednesday's edition of The Washington Post, said a visit by de
Klerk ``would be an important breakthrough'' in U.S.-South African
relations.
   The Post quoted a State Department official as saying that de
Klerk is ``obviously a very important person for us to be talking
to'' if serious negotiations between the races in South Africa are
to be renewed.
   Relations between the United States and South Africa soured
during the Reagan administration because of economic sanctions
imposed by Congress.
   But the commentary noted that President Bush, like Reagan, is a
strong opponent of further sanctions against South Africa.

<HEAD>Government Begins Deporting Nicaraguans from South Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

   The Justice Department has deported the first
Nicaraguan refugees from South Texas since it began detaining
Central American asylum-seekers in February, officials said
Wednesday.
   Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said the
deportations do not signal a change in policy and were delayed
because ``there were some bottlenecks.''
   Although dozens of Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans have
been deported since the Immigration and Naturalization Service
began detaining Central American asylum-seekers on Feb. 20, no
Nicaraguans had been deported until Monday.
   INS spokesman Duke Austin said 10 Nicaraguans were deported
Monday and 16 on Tuesday, with deportation orders pending on more
than 100 others.
   In July 1987, then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III issued a
memorandum encouraging the INS to look favorably on asylum cases
filed by Nicaraguans. That memo required the Justice Department's
asylum policy review unit to examine all requests for refugee
status from Nicaraguans, Austin said.
   The INS recently received approval from the Justice Department
to remove some Nicaraguans, Austin said. Ms. Burstion-Wade said
Deputy Attorney General Harold Christensen has final word on
Nicaraguan deportations.
   In the six months after the Meese memo, the Nicaraguan asylum
approval rate rose to 83 percent, compared with 30 percent before
the directive, according to INS figures released by Rep. John
Bryant, D-Texas.
   On Wednesday, religious leaders who toured the Rio Grande Valley
earlier this week condemned the INS' practice of detaining refugees
and disputed agency claims that the flow reaching Texas has dropped
under its get-tough approach.
   ``Despite the expenditure of a large sum of money (millions of
dollars) by the Immigration and Naturalization Service during the
past 60 days, we saw no convincing evidence that the policy of
increased enforcement, detention and rapid deportation has resulted
in any significant decrease in the flow of Central American
refugees across the border,'' the group's statement said.
   The group from the Interfaith Committee for Central American
Refugee Protection said the INS policy has succeded only in
removing the refugees and the problem from public view, while
creating ``serious obstacles to the filing of legitimate claims.''
   Austin said the group cannot back up claims the flow of aliens
has not fallen, adding: ``We can support with empirical data that
the flow has dramatically decreased,'' Austin said.
   Austin said the number of refugees filing for asylum has fallen
to about 70 or 80 a week, down from about 1,700 to 2,400 a week
earlier this year.

   The Palestine Liberation Organization
accused West German relief workers Wednesday of concealing the
identity of their kidnappers and asked them to vacate their base in
a refugee camp within 10 days.
   The PLO announcement came one day after police reported that
three workers in the private relief organization, ASME-Humanitas,
were abducted in Sidon by gunmen.
   One of the captives, nurse Petra Schnitzler, was freed after a
few hours when a local militia intercepted the kidnap vehicle in
the belief they were stopping escaping thieves.
   Police had no word on the whereabouts of Heinrich Struebig, 48,
an administrator, and Thomas Kemptner, 28, a nurse.
   ``All I can say about this case is that it stinks,'' said a
police spokesman.
   It was the third time Ms. Schnitzler and Struebig had been
reported abducted since last year. The two said they had been freed
from overnight captivity 13 days ago to transmit the demands of the
kidnappers holding a third colleague, Markus Quint. Quint was freed
Sunday.
   Palestinian security officials in south Lebanon quoted Ms.
Schnitzler and Struebig as saying the kidnappers were demanding a
mild sentence for confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a
Lebanese Shiite Moslem.
   A West German court sentenced Hamadi on Wednesday to a life
sentence for air piracy, murder and related charges in the June
1985 hijacking of a TWA passenger jet during which U.S. Navy diver
Robert Stethem was killed.
   A statement issued by the PLO at its Tunis headquarters and
transmitted to the Mieh Mieh Palestinian refugee camp said the
relief workers were covering up the identity of their abductors.
   ``Please, kindly, move out of our area for we are not
responsible for your security conditions from now on,'' the
handwritten, English-language statement said.
   They were given 10 days to pack and leave, a local official said.
   Asked to comment on the accusations that she helped conceal the
kidnappers' identity, Ms. Schnitzler said sarcastically: ``That's a
nice sentence. I would be happy if it were true.''
   She said the group will not take any decision without contacting
their organization.
   West German foreign ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog said the
government had asked the group 15 times to pull out of Lebanon.
   Besides the two West Germans, 15 foreigners are missing in
Lebanon. Most are believed held by Shiite abductors loyal to Iran.

   The parents of U.S. Navy diver
Robert Stethem said Wednesday they want the United States to make
sure the man who murdered their son on a hijacked airliner never
gets out of prison.
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi deserved a death sentence, Richard and
Patricia Stethem said, but the maximum sentence in West Germany is
life imprisonment.
   He was given a life sentence Wednesday for murder, air piracy
and other charges connected with the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA
jetliner, during which 23-year-old Robert Stethem was beaten, shot
and thrown from the aircraft.
   The courtroom in Frankfurt's Preungesheim prison compound was
packed to hear the verdict and sentencing.
   Hamadi, 24, was standing next to his translator and appeared to
slump slightly and bowed his head momentarily when Chief Judge
Heiner Mueckenberger pronounced the maximum sentence.
   Soon afterward, Mr. and Mrs. Stethem met with reporters and read
a statement that said: ``Our family maintains that Mohammed Ali
Hamadi deserves punishment more severe than allowable under German
law.''
   When asked what he meant by a more severe punishment, Stethem
replied: ``The death sentence. I believe that if he had been tried
in the United States, that very possibly he would have been given
the death sentence.''
   In their first public comment since the trial began July 5,
1988, the Stethems expressed concern about speculation that Hamadi
might be freed someday for political reasons.
   ``We mention this because the thought of such a release is
painful for us to think of,'' Stethem said. ``Any commutation of
Hamadi's sentence would be a pure mockery of justice.''
   Last week, Frankfurt lawyer Rainer Hamm said the Stethems and
the 17 other American co-prosecutors feared kidnappings and other
types of ``blackmail'' might lead West Germany to release Hamadi
early. Hamm represented the Americans.
   Stethem said Wednesday, reading from the statement: ``We would
hope any release would result in a public outcry by German and
American citizens alike and would cause people to express outrage
against this type of political injustice.
   ``We would expect our present administration, State Department,
Department of Justice and Congress to monitor the fulfillment of
this sentence and to ensure it is completely served.''
   Prosecutors said Hamadi would be eligible for a parole review in
15 years. The Stethems attended the trial from the beginning.
   ``It was very hard to sit there and hear this, but it was better
to be sitting here and hearing it than sitting in the States and
not knowing what was going on,'' Richard Stethem said. ``We had to
be here to hear it.''
   Mrs. Stethem said, her voice shaking, ``Our purpose for being
there was to represent our son. I thought he deserved that. With
all his bravery, I felt he deserved more than that.''
   Passengers on TWA Flight 847 testified that Robert Stethem was
beaten repeatedly before he was shot.
   During the proceedings, the Stethems sometimes appeared to stare
for long periods directly at Hamadi, across the courtroom from
them. On Wednesday, they acknowledged making eye contact with the
Lebanese Shiite Moslem.
   ``We could look at him and we stared at him a lot, but he wasn't
one to look back at us,'' Richard Stethem said. ``We could catch
him a very few times looking at us.''
   His wife said: ``When we did make eye contact he immediately
dropped his eyes in a guilty sort of way and I felt a lot of guilt
on his part in that way.''
   Asked what she felt in those moments, she replied without
hesitation: ``Like I could go over and punch him out.''
   ``I think that we felt that we probably would like to harm
him,'' her husband added.

   Leaders of Congress and South African
anti-apartheid activists urged the Bush administration on Wednesday
to impose additional economic sanctions against South Africa to
force the white government to grant the black majority political
rights.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``generally
speaking, we have not found sanctions productive and have viewed
additional sanctions as being counter-productive.''
   Fitzwater also confirmed reports that F.W. de Klerk, the leader
of South Africa's National Party who is expected to become
president later this year, would visit the United States. He will
meet with Secretary of State James Baker, but not with Bush,
Fitzwater said. De Klerk would be the first major South African
official to visit here in about 30 years.
   Also, administration officials said veteran diplomat William
Swing is expected to be named ambassador to South Africa. Swing,
54, has previously served as ambassador to the Congo and Liberia.
   The White House said Bush had managed to surmount scheduling
problems and would meet with the South African anti-apartheid
delegation early Thursday.
   The group had asked for the meeting one month ago, but until
Wednesday afternoon the White House said it was having trouble
finding time. Nobel Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu warned
that ``a non-meeting would be a very significant signal'' against
the anti-apartheid movement. Senators Edward Kennedy and Paul Simon
both urged Bush Wednesday to meet with the group.
   Tutu said he had met with Baker recently and felt the new U.S.
administration was ``less doctrinaire'' in its approach toward
South Africa than the previous one.
   Tutu met with former President Reagan in 1984 but he later
called him a ``racist pure and simple'' over the former president's
decision to veto an economic sanctions bill passed by Congress in
1986. Congress overrode the veto but the Reagan administration
implemented the sanctions reluctantly and incompletely.
   Tutu, along with The Reverends Allan Boesak and Beyers Naude,
came to the United States to launch a campaign for reviving the
stalled attempts to legislate additional punitive trade sanctions
on South Africa. They attended a forum with some 80 lawmakers,
governors, academics and businessmen in the ornate Senate Caucus
Room to discuss their plans.
   Simon conceded the new sanctions bill would face a tough fight
in the Senate, where Republicans have threatened to block the
measure with a fillibuster, but pledged to push on with his
efforts. He called Bush's agreement to meet with the group an
encouraging sign.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, one of several Republicans who
attended the forum, urged Bush to ``make a show of good faith
publicly'' in committing his administration to a campaign to end
apartheid.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he was
encouraged by the openness of the Bush administration as signaled
by the presence of Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen at the
gathering. Mitchell said Congress and the administration ``agree
upon the end _ abolition of apartheid. We must now reach agreement
on the means.''
   Kennedy, saying the fight against apartheid has become ``the
greatest human rights struggle of our time,'' urged the Bush
administration to work together with Congress on a new strategy
toward South Africa.
   The South African group argued that without sanctions, their
government would not have any incentive to negotiate with the
country's 28 million blacks who make up 85 percent of the
population. They contended that it was the country's economic
straits _ including inflation, unemployment and a heavy foreign
debt _ that caused the government to agree last year to grant
independence to Namibia and end its occupation of the territory.
   Specifically, the group suggested targeting the coal, oil and
diamond mining industries for punitive measures as a way of
tightening the screws on South Africa. It also urged the United
States to lead an international sanctions campaign against South
Africa.

<HEAD>House Democrats, With GOP Help, Back Senate Restraints on FSX Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic House members, joined by some
Republicans, vowed Wednesday to write into law Senate-passed
restrictions on President Bush's plan to coproduce the FSX jet
fighter with Japan.
   The lawmakers said they will ask the House Foreign Affairs
Committee on Thursday to endorse Senate legislation sponsored by
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., directing the White House to forbid
the transfer of sophisticated jet engine technology to Japan and to
guarantee the United States gets at least 40 percent of the
benefits of the deal.
   The White House said it has ``grave concerns'' that the Byrd
amendment could erode presidential authority. The State Department
said the provision could force renegotiation of the agreement with
the Japanese government.
   The House prepared to begin work on the FSX plan following the
Senate's narrow 52-47 defeat of a bid to reject the arrangement
entirely.
   Although the Senate kept the plan alive, it also voted 72-27
Tuesday to adopt the Byrd amendment's restrictions.
   In the House, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who campaigned for
the Democratic presidential nomination last year on a platform of
protecting U.S. industry against Japanese imports, said it is
essential that Congress adopt the amendment because ``we don't want
some vague promise that doesn't get fulfilled.
   ``It is important to hold the administration's feet to the
fire,'' said Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif. ``We're saying that when you
negotiate a deal, demonstrate that we are really going to get the
40 percent you were talking about.''
   The Senate passed the Byrd amendment by a virtually veto-proof
margin and Levine said there is a good chance the House can follow
suit.
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said the amendment was a
classic example of meddling ``micromanagement'' by Congress. He
described it as ``a sour-grape amendment by those who lost the vote
against FSX in the Senate.''
   But Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md., predicted that a number of
Republicans would join the House's Democratic majority in
supporting the restrictions proposed by Byrd.
   One reason they will do so, she said, is that Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, the Japanese company slated to build the FSX, also
built part of a complex in Libya the United State says is capable
of producing poison gas in large quantities.
   ``You are going to find a lot of Republicans who are against
this,'' Mrs. Bentley said.
   Gephardt was asked if Byrd's proposal is a ``killer amendment''
that would prove fatal to the FSX codevelopment and coproduction
plan.
   ``If it is, it ought to be killed,'' Gephardt said.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
told House Republicans his administration would work against the
Byrd amendment when the measure gets to a HouseSenate conference
committee to resolve variances between the two houses' versions.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois said Bush had
asked Republicans to stick with him on the FSX even though they
face pressure back home.
   Fitzwater said Bush was concerned by the Byrd amendment because
``it creates a system of congressional approval over these kinds of
projects that we consider to be erosive of presidential power.''
   Even before Tuesday's vote, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
S. Eagleburger made it known that the administration regarded the
new directives as unneccessary and likely to trigger new and
lengthy negotiations.
   Byrd told the Senate on Tuesday the restrictions were essential
because ``it would be foolhardy not to be vigilant in protecting
our aircraft industry and the vital technologies associated with
it.''

<HEAD>Cypriots Say Religious Mosaics Held by Dealer Were Stolen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cypriot government and religious
authorities are angrily disputing an Indiana art dealer's claim to
four Byzantine mosaic pieces, claiming the antique holy images were
stolen.
   The removal of the mosaics was an ``act of plunder and
pillage,'' said Thomas Kline, a Washington attorney who represents
Cyprus and the Autocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church. Cypriot
officials were in Washington on Wednesday plotting strategy for the
legal battle over the mosaics.
   Arguments over the 6th century tile mosaics depicting the Christ
Child, the apostles Matthew and James and an angel will be heard
May 30 before a federal judge in Indianapolis.
   The mosaics come from the Panayia Kanakaria Byzantine Church in
the village of Lythrangomi in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus.
Cypriot officials say the mosaics were probably removed in 1979,
five years after the Turks invaded Cyprus.
   The dealer, Peg L. Goldberg, bought the mosaics in Switzerland
for $1.2 million and is trying to sell them to the J. Paul Getty
Museum in Malibu, Calif., for $20 million.
   ``This is going to be interesting case,'' said Constance
Lowenthal, executive director of the International Foundation for
Art Research, a New York-based group dedicated to combating forgery
and theft of artworks.
   The dispute, already known to the art world, has reached the
upper levels of the administration. William von Raab, the head of
the Customs Service, was briefed on the case, as were officials
from the State Department.
   Both the government of Cyprus and Golberg have hired high-priced
attorneys and lobbyists to defend them. Goldberg has enlisted help
from two former aides to Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
   Goldberg, 50, a Hamilton County, Ind., commissioner and a
private art dealer, followed all the proper procedures when she
bought the mosaics indirectly through a Turkish art dealer,
according to Louis Gerig, her public relations consultant in
Indianapolis.
   ``I feel confident she has done all the right things,'' said
Gerig, a former aide to Lugar and assistant press secretary to
former President Reagan. Gerig was also a special assistant to the
commissioner of the Customs Service.
   After Goldberg bought the mosaics and brought them to the United
States in July, Gerig and Jeffrey Bergner, another ex-Lugar aide,
checked with State Department officials to ensure there were no
problems associated with the treasures, Gerig said.
   Gerig said he was assured there were none. Goldberg, however,
never checked with the Cyprus Embassy to find out the status of the
mosaics, embassy officials said.
   Then, Goldberg, through her agent, offered the mosaics to the
Getty Museum. After that, Marion True, the museum's curator of
antiquities, contacted authorities in Cyprus, who said the
antiquities had been stolen, according to a deposition in the case.
   Although Customs agents had allowed the mosaics to come into the
country, the service opened an investigation into the case early
this year, said Gerig, who said he went to see von Raab about the
issue.
   Last February, von Raab signed a letter saying it appeared the
antiquities were brought into the United States properly.
   ``The chief counsel here could not find criminal intent. ... She
in good faith declared the items,'' said Dennis Schimkoski, von
Raab's spokesman.
   In March, attorneys for Cyprus sought a restraining order to
prevent Goldberg from selling the mosaics.
   With the trial slated for later this month, a delegation from
Cyprus arrived here to consult with attorneys seeking to prove in
court the antiquities were stolen from the island, said Marios
Evriviades, a spokesman for the embassy.
   Although the United States and Cyprus have a treaty covering
stolen artworks, the pact was not ratified until 1983. It does not
apply to items removed before that time, said Ann Guthrie-Hingston,
director of the cultural properties advisory board of the U.S.
Information Agency.

<HEAD>Cocaine is Cheaper and Purer, and Users are Hospitalized More Often</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Cocaine was readily available nationwide at
record-low prices last year while hospitals reported emergency-room
visits by users jumped nearly a third, a government study said
Wednesday.
   Users paid between $50 and $120 per gram of cocaine while
wholesale prices ranged between $11,000 and $34,000 per kilogram,
according to the 11th annual survey of illicit drugs by the
National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee.
   Wholesale prices have declined for the fourth straight year from
1985, when a kilogram cost betweeen $30,000 and $50,000, said the
study.
   Last year, a kilogram of cocaine cost between $12,000 and
$40,000, according to the study based on law enforcement reports.
Retail prices ranged between $80 and $120 a gram in 1986 and 1987.
   The study also found that purity of cocaine available to users
had increased from about 50 percent to 70 percent last year,
according to laboratory tests performed by the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   The availability of purer and cheaper cocaine was accompanied by
a projected 30 percent increase in the number of hospital
emergency-room visits due to cocaine use last year, the report said.
   Based on data from the first nine months of 1988, the study
projects there were 42,491 hospital emergencies from cocaine use
last year compared to 32,578 recorded in 1987.
   There were 19,090 emergencies reported in 1986 and 10,397 in
1985, the study said.
   Peru remained the world's largest source of coca and unprocessed
cocaine last year, while ``Colombian nationals continued to be the
predominant ethnic group involved in cocaine processing,
importation and distribution,'' the report said.
   The report also noted that cocaine processing at illegal
laboratories in this country continued to decrease last year. It
concluded that drug traffickers had transferred their operations to
Latin America in the wake of stepped-up U.S. enforcement efforts.
   The number of cocaine laboratories seized by police and federal
agents dropped from 17 in the 1987 fiscal year to nine during the
1988 fiscal year, the report said.
   The report also found that crack was available in most major
metropolitan areas. Only a few major cities, notably Chicago and
St. Louis, did not report serious trafficking in crack.
   Increased crack use was reported last year in Washington,
Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, New Orleans, Denver and Phoenix.
   The study was written by the interagency committee that is
composed of representatives from 11 agencies, including the FBI,
the Coast Guard, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the CIA, the
State Department and the U.S. Customs Service.

   A half-dozen congressmen sat rapt Wednesday as
Murray Feshbach reeled out statistics about the Soviet Union,
showing among other things that the number of Central Asians among
Soviet military recruits was growing far faster than predicted.
   Feshbach, a pioneer in Soviet demography, is in seventh heaven
with the greater openness under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We used to complain that we did not have enough information.
Now we complain that we have too much,'' said Feshbach, interviewed
amid the mountains of Soviet documents at his Georgetown University
office as he prepared for his congressional testimony.
   On Wednesday, he told members of the congressional Commission on
Security and Cooperation in Europe that under Gorbachev the Soviets
were beginning to allocate more resources to the sorely neglected
fields of housing and health care.
   The need is severe, said Feshbach. For example, 40 percent of
Soviet medical school graduates cannot read a cardiograph; 800,000
to 900,000 Soviets suffer every year from hepatitis, compared to
about 56,000 in the United States, and 1,100 to 1,500 Soviet
annually come down with diphtheria, a disease that has virtually
disappeared in the United States.
   Such data are more easily available under Gorbachev, said
Feshbach, but still ``there is a lot missing. And the quality of a
lot of the information is up for grabs.''
   Feshbach has been poring over Soviet statistics since 1955, and
his years of diligence have made him something of a legend in
academia and government agencies that deal with Moscow. Two years
ago, he worked in Brussels as the first Sovietologist-in-residence
for the secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   He experienced one of the high points in his career in late
January, when he was allowed to accompany a Moscow census-taker, an
experience that he says taught him that the Soviets ``are very
likely to publish the figures in a more truthful fashion'' than
after the last census in 1979. The results of that census dribbled
out, with major gaps.
   Preliminary results from the 1989 census already have been
published, and have joined the stacks of documents piled in
Feshbach's office. Much of the news is bad for the Kremlin.
   The population of the Moslem republics of Central Asia, where
there is little industry and lots of underemployment, continued to
grow at a much faster pace than in the Slavic republics, where
workers are needed. Russia grew by 7 percent, compared to 28
percent for Turkmenistan, 22 percent for Kirghizia, 29 percent for
Uzbekistan, and 34 percent for Tadzhikistan.
   Other Soviet publications have reported that the percentage of
Soviet conscripts who come from the Moslem republics of Central
Asia and Caucasia has risen from 28 percent in 1980 to 37 percent
in 1988, he said.
   ``That was my projection for the year 2000,'' Feshbach told the
congressional panel. He had been predicting for years that the
exploding population of Central Asia would pose problems,
particularly in the Soviet military.
   Recent Soviet articles have confirmed that the Central Asian
conscripts have trouble mastering the Russian language and the
complicated machinery of modern war.
   ``Ninety percent of rural Central Asians do not speak Russian,''
Feshbach told the congressional panel. ``That could lead to a
volunteer army within five years or so.''
   Feshbach, discussing the latest wave of Soviet statistics with a
reporter, sorted through census data to figure how many people died
in the Armenian earthquake last December.
   He calculated that population of Armenia had been growing by
about 50,000 per year, added that to the 1988 figure, subtracted
the 1989 figure, and concluded that there are ``approximately
250,000'' fewer people in Armenia than there would have been with
no earthquake.
   The official Soviet death toll: 25,000.

<HEAD>Bush Names Former Campaign Aide as FEMA Associate Director</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday announced he will
name former campaign aide Antonio Lopez as associate director of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   The president also said he has decided to retain two holdover
appointees: Charles E.M. Kolb as deputy undersecretary of Education
for planning, budget and evaluation; and Roland R. Vautour as
undersecretary of Agriculture.
   Lopez has been a presidential special assistant and director of
the White House Military Office for Bush and previously worked on
Bush's presidential campaign. Before that, he was a business
consultant in Covington, Tenn.
   Kolb has been acting deputy undersecretary for Education since
September 1988, and previously was deputy general counsel in the
department.
   He also has worked as assistant general counsel in the Office of
Management and Budget and as an attorney in private practice.
   Vautour has served as Agriculture undersecretary for small
community and rural development since September 1987. Previously he
was Farmers Home Administration state director in Vermont, New
Hampshire, and the Virgin Islands.

<HEAD>Bush Won't Block Possible Foreign Acquisition</HEAD>

   President Bush has decided not to block the
possible foreign acquisition of Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s
interest in a joint venture with a European company, the
administration said Wednesday.
   Bush made his decision after an investigation by an inter-agency
committee headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. The
president has the power to block foreign acquisitions of American
companies if the sales would endanger national security.
   The latest review involved a joint venture between Westinghouse
and ASEA Brown Boveri LTD (ABB), a manufacturing firm based in
Switzerland.
   The joint venture, known as Westinghouse-ABB Power T&amp;D Co., was
created earlier in the year to manufacture and sell high-voltage
electrical transmission equipment.
   In announcing Bush's decision, the administration said that ABB
had confirmed its intention to continue manufacturing the high
voltage transformers in the United States even if it did excercise
its option under the agreement to purchase Westinghouse's share of
the joint venture.
   Under the agreement, Westinghouse, which is based in Pittsburgh,
now owns 55 percent of the joint venture and ABB owns 45 percent.
   The joint company planned to serve the electrical transmission
markets in the United States, Brazil and Argentina with expected
annual sales of $1 billion, according to a company news release.
   The operation employs 10,000 workers in 20 Westinghouse
facilities and three ABB facilities in the United States and Latin
America, the company said.

<HEAD>Moscow Conference Opens on Freedom to Emigrate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All people should be free to leave their homeland,
speakers said Wednesday at an officially recognized conference on
emigration rights held in the country most often publicly accused
of violating them.
   ``The right to leave is at the core of international
humanitarian law,'' said law professor Irwin Cotler of Canada's
McGill University. ``It is tantamount to the right to liberty and
even, I would say, to the right to life.''
   Speakers said the Soviet record on emigration has improved under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but the improvements have not been
guaranteed by law. A new, more liberal law on emigration is
expected to emerge in the coming weeks.
   Foreign Ministry official Vladimir Morozov said 108,000 citizens
emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1988, 20 times as many as in
1986. He admitted that emigration officials had often abused their
positions, but said the forthcoming law would make them more
accountable.
   The conference, titled ``Freedom of Movement for All,'' was
sponsored by the International Foundation for the Survival and
Development of Humanity. Soviet human rights activist Andrei
Sakharov presides over the foundation's human rights committee, but
could not attend.
   The foundation was formed in Moscow in January 1988 to direct
studies on such threats to mankind as the arms race, pollution and
hunger. It has offices in Moscow, Stockholm and Washington. Its
Soviet members include officials and unofficial figures.
   In the first quarter of 1989, the Soviet Union granted 57,000
exit permits, mainly to ethnic Germans, Armenians, Pentecostalists
and Jews. Last month, 4,557 Jews left, the highest figure for any
single month since Jewish emigration peaked in October 1979.
   President Bush said last week he would ask Congress to ease the
Jackson-Vanik amendment, which links trade concessions for
Communist countries to emigration performance, provided Moscow
fulfills its promises on new laws and their enforcement.
   Among Soviets attending the conference, however, many said they
were still denied exit from the country, largely because of their
purported knowledge of state secrets. Elya Varshavskaya, 75, said
she was not allowed to join her only son in Denmark because she
worked for the secret police more than 40 years ago.
   Soviet officials have said the new law on emigration will ease
secrecy restrictions and probably repeal the requirement that a
prospective emigrant have an invitation from a close relative.
   In a summary of one report to be presented at the conference,
Professor Vladimir Kartashkin recommends that passports for foreign
travel be made available to any citizen who wants one and that a
maximum of five years be set for the validity of state secrets.
   Kartashkin, of the national Academy of Sciences' Institute of
State and Law, also said Soviets should not be deprived of
citizenship if they leave to live abroad.
   Among Soviet emigres stripped of their citizenship were ballet
dancers Mikhail Baryshnikov and Rudolf Nureyev and cellist Mstislav
Rostropovich. They were denied entry to the Soviet Union until it
recently began to welcome them back for visits. Ordinary emigrants
also routinely lose their citizenship.
   Conference organizers distributed an appeal asking all
governments that limit freedom of movement to bring their laws into
line with international human rights agreements and encourage
travel and emigration.

   A 12-year-old pleaded guilty Wednesday
to murder and arson for setting a fire that killed his babysitter.
   Clutching a stack of baseball cards, fidgeting and frequently
grinning at his attorney, blond-haired, crew-cut Scott James enter
the plea as he was about to go to trial in the Dec. 31 death of
53-year-old Raymond R. Lauzon.
   Sentencing was set for May 30. The boy, who was 11 when he set
the blaze, will be freed from custody by his 21st birthday because
he was charged as a juvenile.
   ``Scott needs a lot of help and it's time he got it,'' defense
attorney Thomas Van Houten said.
   ``We hope that something good will come out of it for him,''
said Assistant Attorney General Eric Wright.
   The defendant told the judge he started the fire. But he
disputed the prosecution's contention that he told his younger
brother he wanted to see what it would be like to burn the house
and kill the man.
   Wright said Lauzon had caught the boy trying to steal some money
from his wallet.
   Scott and his brother were staying in Lauzon's apartment while
their mother went to a bar with Lauzon's son on New Year's Eve.

   North Korea has consistently demanded withdrawal of the more

precondition to normalizing relations and unifying North and South
Korea.
   The United States describes its military presence as a deterrent

<HEAD>Caution Urged on Yeutter in Opening Conservation Land to Grazing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two environmental groups said Wednesday they
have urged Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter to go slow in
deciding whether to open up millions of acres of long-term
conservation land to haying and grazing in drought-stricken areas.
   Pressure has been generated on Capitol Hill and from some state
governors for the Agriculture Department to approve haying or
grazing, or both, on highly erodible land taken from crop
production under the Conservation Reserve Program.
   But Kenneth A. Cook, vice president for policy at the Center for
Resource Economics, and Justin R. Ward, senior project associate of
the Natural Resources Defense Council, said it is premature to open
up the conservation lands as a source of livestock feed.
   In the 1988 drought, the USDA approved haying on millions of
acres of CRP land in dozens of states. But none has been approved
for haying or grazing in 1989.
   Cook and Ward said in a letter to Yeutter that several major
farming areas face the possibility of a second straight year of
severe drought.
   ``It is early in the growing season and the threat will not
materialize if moisture-deficient areas in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska
and other states receive the amount of rainfall the National
Weather Service has recently forecast,'' the letter said.
   It is understandable, Cook and Ward said, that many farmers,
particularly livestock producers, are extremely anxious at this
time.
   But ``we urge you to proceed with deliberation and caution in
any decision to open the CRP,'' they said. ``The public has already
invested billions of dollars in the CRP and will invest billions
more in the years ahead.''
   Such investment, Yeutter was told, could be compromised if USDA
does not establish ``clear, consistent criteria and procedures''
for deciding on the emergency use of CRP lands.
   More than 28 million acres have been set aside under the CRP and
is supposed to remain out of production for 10 years. The contracts
specify that protective grass and trees must be planted to project
the fragile soil from wind and water erosion.
   In return, farmers get initial financial help from USDA to plant
the grass and trees. Each year they get federal rental payments,
averaging around $50 per acre annually. These currently cost about
$1.5 billion a year.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves ``Truth in Savings'' Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee moved Wednesday to make
banks disclose annual percentage yields and fees on savings and
other deposit accounts but only after weakening the ability of
consumers to sue if they don't.
   The ``truth in savings'' legislation was approved unanimously by
the House Banking Committee's subcommittee on consumer affairs
after it was amended to allow only actual account holders to sue
over false advertising or other violations.
   The bill is intended to outlaw what Rep. Richard Lehman,
D-Calif., the panel's chairman, called ``teaser rates'' and other
misleading advertising by banks and other financial institutions in
trying to attract deposits.
   Peggy Miller of the Consumer Federation of America said banks
now use ``snake oil practices'' to lure deposits and then play
``deceitful games'' through service fees, undisclosed withdrawal
penalties and inconsistent disclosures ``to cheat consumers out of
earning the advertised yield on their accounts.''
   As an example, she cited one day's issue of The Washington Post
in which advertisements for various financial institutions used 11
different yield terms to describe the interest rates they were
offering to depositors.
   ``Consumers confronted with this broad array of terminology can
only throw up their hands in hopeless confusion and hope that they
get the best deal possible,'' she said.
   The bill requires that banks, savings and loans and credit
unions clearly and conspicuously give the annual percentage yield
most prominence in their advertising and also disclose any minimum
balances necessary and the annual rate of simple interest.
   The financial institutions also have to maintain and disclose
fee schedules and terms and conditions applicable to each class of
accounts they offer ``in order to provide consumers a meaningful
way to compare deposit instruments.''
   Account holders who believe those conditions were violated could
sue for damages and attorneys' fees plus penalities of $100 to
$1,000 as an indiviudal or up to $500,000 or 1 percent of an
institution's net worth in class-action suits.
   Lehman's original version allowed anyone to file such a suit,
but it was amended, on a 9-6 vote, to cover only current account
holders or those who had closed an account with the past year.
   The amendment was approved after Federal Reserve Board member
Martha Seeger complained the ``sweeping'' civil liability
provisions ``subject institutions to costly litigation by the
public at large.''
   Ms. Miller, however, said the amendment opens a loophole in
which consumers who paid up-front application fees to open accounts
but never actually did could never recover what they lost.
   The bill was generally supported by banking groups after they
succeeded in thwarting earlier attempts by lawmakers to make them
adopt uniform methods for compounding interest accruals daily.
   Similar legislation was approved last year by both the House and
Senate but died in the waning days of the 100th Congress. A
virtually identical bill, except that it also applies to mutual
funds, has been introduced in the Senate this year by Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.

<HEAD>Denver OKs New Airport, Seattle Puts Cap on Downtown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Seattle voters put the brakes on growth in the tallest city in
the West, Denver residents gave clearance to build a $2.3 billion
airport, and Pittsburgh's ``Jewish grandmother'' won the
all-important Democratic nomination for mayor.
   In other elections Tuesday, voters rejected tax overhauls in
Pennsylvania and Oregon and approved a Tucson, Ariz., school bond
package totaling $398 million _ 10 times the amount of a similar
measure that was rejected last year.
   In Pittsburgh, Mayor Sophie Masloff, 71, won the primary and
practically guaranteed herself victory in November. She was City
Council president last year when she was appointed to succeed the
late Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri.
   Denver voters sided 63 percent to 37 percent with Mayor Federico
Pena and Gov. Roy Romer, agreeing it was time to replace
60-year-old Stapleton International Airport, the nation's fifth
largest, with an airport 20 miles from downtown.
   It would be the nation's first new airport since Dallas-Fort
Worth International opened in 1974. Pena and Romer said Stapleton
was overcrowded and obsolete. Opponents said the plan was
unnecessary and too costly.
   Seattle residents approved an initiative that restricts the
density of buildings downtown and limits their height to 450 feet,
about 38 stories, for the next 10 years while a long-range
development plan is adopted.
   The city's tallest building is the 76-story Columbia Center.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, the count was 42,643 to
26,303, with only a simple majority required.
   Voters delivered setbacks to Govs. Robert P. Casey of
Pennsylvania and Neil Goldschmidt of Oregon, who put their
reputations behind proposals to overhaul their states' taxes.
   Pennsylvania voters turned back, 75 percent to 25 percent, a
referendum that would have allowed counties to impose income taxes
in exchange for a reduction in property taxes.
   Also defeated was a Philadelphia proposal to legalize charity
raffles and other small games of chance.
   Oregonians rejected, 59 percent to 41 percent, a measure that
would have updated tax bases in about a third of the state's school
districts, effectively allowing them to raise property taxes
without asking voter approval.

<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels said Wednesday they
have not abandoned their fight for the besieged eastern city of
Jalalabad, but are reorganizing for assaults on other
communist-held cities in Afghanistan.
   The Moslem guerrillas and Western diplomats reported fresh
fighting in the war-torn country, including the destruction by
guerrillas of a northern ammunition dump laden with Soviet weapons.
   A seven-party guerrilla alliance based in Pakistan issued a
statement Wednesday describing reports they had given up the fight
for Jalalabad as ``baseless.''
   An Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman told Western reporters in
Kabul, the capital, Tuesday that guerrillas had given up on
Jalalabad and turned their attention on Khost, about 84 miles to
the south.
   Rebels confirmed the fighting at Khost and said a recent lull in
fighting at Jalalabad probably was due to a visit there by
guerrilla leader Yunis Khalis.
   Khalis, elderly head of the hardline Hezb-i-Islami rebel group,
is reportedly meeting with field commanders to map out new tactics
to break a nearly three-month old stalemate at Jalalabad.
   Communist government forces finally launched a counterattack
late last week but guerrillas pushed them back, using some of their
own captured tanks, according to combined reports.
   The rebels, backed primarily by Pakistan and the United States,
have vowed to fight on until the collapse of Kabul's ruling
Marxists and the establishment of an Islamic republic of
Afghanistan.
   The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized power in a
bloody 1978 military coup, sparking the Moslem insurgency. Soviet
forces intervened in December 1979 to prop up the government but
finally withdrew in February under a U.N.-brokered acord.
   With a harsh winter behind them, the rebels say they are
preparing major assaults on Kabul and the southeastern city of
Kandahar.
   One rebel commander, Mohammad Nasir, said about 30,000 rebels
were organizing to attack the heavily fortified capital as early as
this weekend.
   However, a rival commander said he thought Nasir was boasting.
   ``We are making careful plans for Kabul to avoid the same
mistakes as Jalalabad,'' said Abdul Haq of the Khalis faction,
reputed to be the most powerful of rebel commanders in the Kabul
area.
   He was referring to criticism that rebels attacked Jalalabad
before they were sufficiently armed and organized.
   ``We're working on detailed plans as to how and when. ... But
I'm not going to print my plans in the newspapers,'' Haq said on a
visit to Peshawar, Pakistan.
   Rebel sources said some rebel commanders are holding out for
negotiations with government troops in order to avoid civilian
bloodshed.
   Rebel reorts Wednesday said guerrillas blew up a major
ammunition dumpat Mazar-i-Sharif, capital of northern Balkh
province some 36 miles from the Soviet border, around May 7.
   Masood Khalili, a spokesman of the Jamiat-i-Islami rebel group,
said the blast killed 360 communist soldiers and wounded 100. He
said at least 175 Soviet-built tanks and armored personnel carriers
were destroyed in two days of fires and secondary explosions.
   Unconfirmed reports said the communists plan to shift their
capital to Mazar-i-Sharif if Kabul falls to the rebels.
   In another development, a Soviet official in London charged
Wednesday that the United States and Pakistan have failed to honor
the accord on Afghanistan by continuing to provide military and
moral support to the guerrillas.
   ``Pakistan and the United States, when they were signing the
Geneva accords, it se They can't tell
authorities wh options to utilize,'' said Rep. Frank Pallone Jr.,
as a House rine and fisheries subcommittee 
presentations on a range of technologies used he subcommittee, in its second
day of reports on compliance
with the Ocean Dumping Act of 1988, examined ways that nine New
York and New Jersey sludge dumpers could dispose of their wastes
and meet the Dec. 31, 1991, deadline to cease sludge dumping.
   Sally Lentz, staff attorney for the non-profit Oceanic Society,
said a lawsuit filed by six New Jersey communities against EPA to
challenge stiff fines being imposed for an inability to stop
dumping by 1991 has set back the process and could jeopardize the
public's input into local compliance plans.
   Ms. Lentz also cautioned the committee that it is virtually
impossible to quantify environmental damage from sludge dumped at a
designated site 106 miles off the New Jersey shore, and, on that
basis, said she was disappointed in the way the EPA has discounted
potential health effects linked to sludge.
   New Jersey Democratic Rep. William J. Hughes said Garden State
communities trying to implement dumping alternatives could benefit
from an information clearinghouse. However, he was quick to praise
the EPA's overall performance in encouraging compliance from the
dumpers.
   ``I recognize it's often popular to jump on the Environmental
Protection Agency. My constituents want us to stop dumping
yesterday,'' Hughes said.
   ``Region II (of the EPA) is making an impressive and enormous
effort,'' said Lynne Edgerton, a coastal protection attorney with
the Natural Resources Defense Council. However, she warned that
communities' commitment to a single solution, such as incineration,
``excludes any opportunity to re-use this material.''
   L. Jack Davis, a former EPA regional administrator in Atlanta
and Dallas who now serves as president of Dallas-based Oxidyne
Corp., acknowledged the need to provide guidance to communities
seeking to dispose of their sludge.
   ``EPA has a very undirected research program,'' said Davis,
whose company injects the sludge and organic waste into a mile-deep
well, where it is treated and converted into carbon dioxide, ash
and water that requires further purification.
   David Greenhut, director of marketing and new product
development for Kubota America Corp., said Kubota transforms sludge
into a chemically stable, glass-like material ``which in turn is
used in the production of ceramic tiles, cinder blocks, ground
cover, drainage fill, and in asphaltic and cement mixes.''
   The Kubota end-product contains the metals found in sewage
sludge, but in an inert form, he said. Japan has approved the final
product as a substitute for landfill sand, improving agent for poor
drainage land, anti-water penetrant agent for tennis courts and
playgrounds, pavement material for light-load roads and bedding for
pipes.
   Ernest A. Kollitides, president and chief operating officer of
Dehydro-Tech Corp., of East Hanover, N.J., said his firm has been
using its patented Carver-Greenfield Process to evaporate the
liquid from sludge using a light oil. With that process, which is
being installed at sludge plants in Mercer and Ocean counties in
New Jersey, the resulting dry solids can be used as fertilizer or
as fuel to produce steam and electricity.
   The left-over water is clean and requires only minimal
treatment, he said, and the oil-soluble compounds in the sludge are
removed, such as pesticides, herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls,
dioxins and cleaning fluids.
   Kollitides said Mercer County Improvement Authority communities
in New Jersey will feed raw sludge to their Carver-Greenfield
facility, which will produce fertilizer and burn sewage oil from
the sludge to produce steam to power the process.

<TEXT>
   A minister who operates a children's home
was sentenced to a year in prison Wednesday for striking a state
trooper during a raid prompted by allegations of abuse.
   Circuit Judge Clinton Lockard also placed the Rev. Herman
Fountain, 39, on four years' probation but allowed him to remain
free on $40,000 bail pending an appeal.
   A jury Tuesday deliberated for less than an hour before
convicting Fountain of assault on an officer.
   Highway Patrol Capt. Richard Smith testified that when
authorities took children from the home to the courthouse June 13,
Fountain charged at him, hit him and kicked him.
   Fountain testified that he did not intend to hit Smith, but may
have done so as he rushed to the courthouse basement to see what
was happening to the children.
   ``I acted like any momma or daddy when they hear their child
screaming,'' Fountain said. ``They (officers) were pushing me
around like a dog. The whole thing was a farce.''
   Some parents who have entrusted troubled children to Fountain's
care at the independent Baptist church-based Bethel Children's Home
say he has been unfairly targeted by the state Department of Public
Welfare.
   The agency last year took custody of 72 youngsters in an
investigation of beatings and other abuse at the home. The court
gave the state custody of 17 children found to have been abused;
the rest were returned to their parents or guardians.
   Under state law, church-run homes are exempt from state
regulation, and Bethel has taken in more children.

   A federal grand jury indicted a state
senator and his former aide Wednesday on bribery and extortion
charges.
   Joseph Montoya, chairman of the Senate Business and Professions
Committee, was indicted as a result of a three-year FBI undercover
investigation. The investigation became public in August when
federal agents searched the Capitol offices of Montoya and three
other legislators.
   U.S. Attorney David Levi said Montoya, a Democrat, and Amiel A.
Jaramillo were named in a 12-count indictment under two
anti-corruption laws, the Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt
Organizations Act and the Hobbs Act.
   The indictment says Montoya and Jaramillo used the office of
state senator ``to unlawfully obtain campaign contributions and
other payments, including speaking fees.''
   In the FBI probe, federal agents posed as businessmen and set up
phony companies that dispensed at least $90,000 to lawmakers and
political consultants in return for favors, according to public
documents and private business records.
   Montoya and Jaramillo were not available to comment, an aide
told a reporter at Montoya's office.
   Montoya faces maximum penalties of 160 years in prison and $1
million in fines, plus forfeiture of any illegally acquired
property if convicted. Jaramillo faces 80 years in prison and
$250,000 in fines.

   Loyal troops battled rebel soldiers
in the capital Wednesday, and the president cut short a state visit
to East Germany to try to crush the coup attempt. Reports said the
mutineers control a key northern city.
   The defense minister was slain by rebel soldiers in the revolt,
which began Tuesday, and troops killed two rebellious generals,
according to government sources and state radio. The total number
of dead was not known.
   Government sources said the rebellious generals were among five
coup leaders and that soldiers and police hunted for the other
three.
   After a pitched tank and artillery battle on the outskirts and
firefights in town Wednesday, Addis Ababa appeared calm and under
control of the Marxist government of President Mengistu Haile
Mariam _ the Soviet Union's strongest ally in Africa.
   Reports from the war-torn north, however, indicate thousands of
soldiers there support the coup bid and have control of Asmara,
Ethiopia's second- largest city. They were broadcasting messages
declaring the coup a success on a frequency normally used by the
government radio station there.
   Addis Ababa Radio repeatedly reported the revolt was crushed.
   ``In Addis itself, it's increasingly looking like a failed coup,
but it appears to be a very different story in other parts of the
country and especially in the north,'' said a Western diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
described the situation in Ethiopia as ``fluid and uncertain.''
   He said it was not clear if the coup had been put down and cited
reports Wednesdsay that fighting has broken out again among
military units in Addis Ababa.
   Mengistu, who has ruled this strategic Horn of Africa nation for
15 years, cut short a state visit to communist East Germany and
arrived home Wednesday, Addis Ababa radio said. He was met by Prime
Minister Fikre Selassie Wogderes and Vice President Fiseha Desta,
it said.
   The airport has been closed since Tuesday, in addition to the
capital's schools, businesses and shops. State radio urged
residents to stay home.
   Air traffic controllers Wednesday advised commercial and private
pilots of the danger of being shot down by dissident troops over
Asmara, capital of secessionist-minded Eritrea Province.
   Asmara is headquarters of Ethiopia's 2nd Army _ 150,000 soldiers
that diplomats and rebels believe support the coup.
   The Western diplomat in Addis Ababa said it was not known
whether the army has handed its arms to the secessionist Eritrean
People's Liberation Front or whether it was continuing to fight the
government on its own.
   A spokesman for the Eritrean rebels in Rome said, ``Eritrea is
under the control of (rebellious elements in) the Ethiopian army,
they have managed to dominate the situation ... they are fighting
the regime.''
   According to reports monitored in London by the British
Broadcasting Corp., a radio station describing itself as the
``Voice of Ethiopia located in Asmara'' said Eritrean rebel forces
had imposed a nighttime curfew on the town.
   The BBC also monitored a report on the rebels' ``Voice of the
Broad Masses of Eritrea'' that quoted Asmara radio as saying
Tuesday that Mengistu had been ousted.
   The capital's residents awoke to sounds of a heavy tank and
artillery battle at a military compound on the outskirts.
   ``It was thunderous,'' said the diplomat. ``You could feel
buildings shaking here in the city.
   ``After that, things calmed down for a while, but then there
were several fairly severe firefights around town,'' he said.
``What we think was happening is that loyal troops were flushing
out insurgents who were in hiding.
   By midafternoon it was calm, he said. ``But the situation is
obviously quite tense and the army is everywhere.''
   An African military attache in Addis Ababa said the army
garrison in Harar, eastern Ethiopia, also is supporting coup
leaders and that negotiations are under way in Addis Ababa between
loyalists and dissidents.
   ``Things are bad,'' the attache said. ``It is just that they
(the government) are not saying.''
   Addis Ababa Radio said Maj. Gen. Merid Negusie, the chief of
staff, and the air force commander, Maj. Gen. Amha Desta, were
killed Tuesday by loyalists.
   The station made no mention of Wednesday's fighting.
   Government sources said they expect an official announcement
soon of the death of the defense minister, Maj. Gen. Haile Giorgis
Habte Mariam.
   Government sources said troops are searching for coup plotters
they identified as Industry Minister Fanta Belay, who used to
command the air force; Aberra Abdualem, chief of operations in the
Defense Ministry; and Kumalapchew Dejene, deputy commander of armed
forces in Eritrea.
   There have been persistent reports of military unrest in
Ethiopia, especially among field commanders who reportedly believe
the government has not supported them adequately in the 28-year-old
northern civil war.
   The military deposed Emperor Haile Selassie in a coup on Sept.
12, 1974. After factional fighting within in the armed forces,
Mengistu, then an army major, seized power.
   Mengistu inherited the northern insurrections, in which his
forces recently have suffered humiliating defeats.
   The Ethiopian army is Africa's best equipped and the continent's
largest, although many of its quarter of a million troops are
unwilling conscripts.

   Dallas-born Henry Catto, the new U.S. ambassador,
traded his Stetson for a top hat Wednesday to lead a horse carriage
procession to Buckingham Palace and present his credentials to the
queen.
   Catto set off from his embassy to the cheers of colleagues, then
returned to fulfill the custom of treating the state footmen to
champagne and their horses to sugar and carrots.
   The ceremony and private audience with Queen Elizabeth II marked
his introduction as the 27th U.S. ambassador to the Court of St.
James, the nearby 16th-century palace where envoys still are
accredited.
   ``I feel wonderful,'' beamed the 58-year-old businessman and
close friend of President Bush. ``How could you not, on a day like
this?''
   Catto, who has businesses in Houston and San Antonio but whose
Texas drawl has been diluted by decades in Washington, said, ``The
queen is just the easiest person in the world to talk to.''
   During the 20-minute audience in the palace's white-and-gold
1844 room _ named for the year Czar Nicholas of Russia visited
Queen Victoria _ they discussed the visit of Bush at the end of
this month, the private visit of former President Reagan in
mid-June and ``generalities.''
   Catto presented her with two letters from the White House: one
for his accreditation and the other with his predecessor's recall.
   He didn't show her the Texas hedgear he'd lovingly carried with
him to London. ``It's up in the office,'' he said of his Stetson.
``I didn't have the nerve.''
   Catto, who runs a string of TV stations with his wife, Jessica,
arrived April 23 to replace Charles H. Price II, who retired at the
end of February after a six-year term.
   The ``special relationship'' between the United States and Great
Britain is also a personal relationship for Catto, who hopes to
have time to trace the ancestors of his Scottish grandfather who
emigrated to the United States a century ago.
   Catto's only other appointment as an ambassador came in 1969, as
deputy U.S. representative to the Organization of American States.
He subsequently was chief of protocol, permanent representative to
the European Office of the United Nations in Geneva and chief
spokesman for the Pentagon.
   He has kept his hand in business, through the H and C
Communication television network he runs with his wife. She once
edited, and he owned, the Washington Journalism Review magazine,
and he continues to write for various publications.
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Catto was in Colorado attending to her real
estate business, and none of their four grown children was present.
   Followed by eight embassy counselors in top hat and tails, Catto
and the uniformed marshall of the diplomatic corps, Lt. Gen. Sir
John Richards, led the procession of three open carriages the short
ride to the palace.
   Back at the embassy, Catto distributed champagne and carrots, as
required.
   ``Can I interest you in a drop?'' Catto asked one footman in a
bright orange-red coat. ``To your very good health, sir,'' came the
acceptance.
   Later, rubbing sugar from his hands, Catto said he'd begun to
settle in.
   ``No culture shock yet,'' he said, smiling. ``I can now find my
way to the office. And so far I've almost been able to master the
language.''

<HEAD>Gas Decontrol Bill Wins Senate Committee Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate panel Wednesday approved legislation
to lift remaining price controls on natural gas by 1993, nudging
the energy industry one step closer to a long-sought prize it says
will benefit consumers as well as commerce.
   Experts generally agree that natural gas prices would be
unlikely to rise immediately in reaction to ending price controls,
since the market price currently is well below the controlled
price. Many industry officials predict, however, that growing
demand for gas in the 1990s would likely push prices substantially
higher.
   With only Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, voicing strenuous
objections, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
approved the bill 17-2. The full Senate may consider the bill as
early next week, although the timing was uncertain.
   The House passed a nearly identical bill last month with
virtually no dissent.
   The legislation is strongly supported by the Bush
administration, which has made gas decontrol a key feature of its
evolving energy policy. President Bush, echoing industry arguments
in favor of decontrol, has said the move would restore free-market
forces in an industry that has been under federal price controls
since 1954.
   Industry groups have said price decontrol would stimulate more
production of natural gas, which currently accounts for about
one-quarter of the nation's energy supply.
   The legislation would complete a price decontrol process that
began in 1978 with the Natural Gas Policy Act, which removed price
limits on certain kinds of gas while also establishing two dozen
categories of gas, each with a ceiling price.
   Some consumer groups have opposed the gas decontrol bill, saying
that while it might not trigger an immediate price rise it does
nothing to correct other regulatory problems that mean higher costs
to the 48 million households that use natural gas.
   Industrial users of natural gas generally favor the legislation.
   ``It will stimulate new production and make more natural gas
available at cheaper prices,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief
economist of the National Assocation of Manufacturers.
   Metzenbaum, a long-standing opponent of gas decontrol, said he
suspected the major oil companies that own about 45 percent of the
nation's gas reserves are holding a lot of gas off the market until
the federal price controls are removed.
   ``You may bet all the tea in China that natural gas prices will
go up and go up substantially'' within a few years, if price
controls are ended, he said, calling the bill ``the most
anti-consumer piece of legislation we have ever enacted.''
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., also voted against the bill. He said,
however, that his position was based mainly on concern about how
the legislation might affect federal regulatory authority over
natural gas transportation. He said he might reconsider his vote
depending on how the transport issue was resolved on the Senate
floor.
   The only major difference between the House and Senate bills is
that the House version would lift price controls on newly drilled
wells immediately, instead of in 1993. The Senate bill has no such
provision.
   About one-third of U.S. natural gas currently is subject to
federal price controls.

   Chinese long have complained about corruption and
their lack of basic freedoms, but they dared not protest until a
plucky group of students with the same grievances staged a defiant
hunger strike.
   Inspired by the 3,000 students fasting for democracy in
Tiananmen Square, the Chinese masses have found their voice and for
the first time are telling their Communist leaders loud and clear
what they think of their rule.
   In a massive show of dissatisfaction, more than 1 million people
_ including workers, students and even government employees _
poured into central Beijing on Wednesday to support the hunger
strikers, who are fasting to press student demands for more freedom
and clean government.
   As they marched up and down the broad avenues of the nation's
capital, workers and students chanted, ``Down with official
profiteering!'' and ``Oppose corruption!''
   Some boldly called on Premier Li Peng and China's senior leader
Deng Xiaoping to resign _ they consider Li too conservative and the
84-year-old Deng too old. A student standing on top of a school bus
repeatedly shouted, ``Li Peng!'' and the crowd replied, ``Step
down!''
   Just a few weeks ago, said a 38-year-old auto worker who was
marching with hundreds of his colleagues, such a display would have
been unthinkable. ``I absolutely would not have believed this could
happen,'' he said.
   The protests result from a general dissatisfaction has been
growing for some time.
   In the past 10 years, China's economy has made a remarkable
recovery under Deng's pragmatic market-oriented policies. But
widespread corruption by Communist officials and dismay that
political liberalization has proceeded at a much slower pace than
economic reform has caused increased grumbling.
   Privately, Chinese relate their latest brush with corrupt
officials or criticize the lack of democracy. But before last
month, only a handful of intellectuals dared speak out.
   China's most prominent critic was astrophysicist Fang Lizhi,
whose international prestige as a scientist probably protects him
from extreme government action.
   When the students first began demonstrating for democracy after
the death of former Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang, workers
obviously were sympathetic.
   Students who marched through Beijing received cheers and
donations, but many workers still were frightened to join the
processions.
   The hunger strikers have changed that.
   Workers were touched by the students' plight, and the resolve of
the hunger-strikers remained strong while their health
deteriorated. The widespread admiration for the fasters, whose
goals are shared by many Chinese, was obvious Wednesday.
   ``They're hearts are bleeding,'' said one laborer. ``They have
been on hunger strike for several days; the workers can no longer
be silent.''
   Many people said that the students' demands, such as a dialogue
with the government, were reasonable and should be accepted by the
government to end the strike.
   But the delay in resolving the impasse has bolstered the student
protest with hundreds of thousands of workers and other supporters
who otherwise might have stayed silent.
   One poster in Tiananmen Square on Wednesday summed up the new
order: ``The students are the vanguard, the workers are the backup
force.''

<HEAD>Sandinistas Accuse US Continuing to Support Contra War</HEAD>

   The Foreign Ministry claimed Wednesday
the United States was continuing to support guerrilla war by
Nicaraguan rebels and said it had complained to Washington.
   The ministry said more than 1,000 people on both sides had been
killed or wounded this year and that the rebels, known as Contras,
attacked military or civilian targets 58 times in the first half of
May alone.
   Contra spokesmen denied the claims, accusing Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government of trying through propaganda to avoid
complying with a regional peace agreement.
   Nicaragua's protest was contained in a letter to Secretary of
State James A. Baker III from Jose Leon Talavera, the deputy
foreign minister.
   ``If the United States is truly interested in advancing toward a
solution of the Central American crisis, it should begin by
respecting the will of Central Americans themselves,'' Talavera
said in the letter, dated May 16.
   Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front, published the letter Wednesday, and ministry
spokesman David Silva said it had been sent to Baker.
   Last month, Congress approved $48 million in non-lethal aid to
keep the Contras intact through Feb. 25, 1990, when general
elections are scheduled in Nicaragua.
   About 10,000 Contras are in jungle camps in neighboring Honduras
along with 11,000 family members. Most of the rebels left Nicaragua
after Contra and Sandinista leaders signed a temporary truce in
March 1988.
   Since then, the Sandinistas have extended the truce unilaterally
on a month-by-month basis and only sporadic skirmishes had been
reported.
   Talavera said in the letter, however, that Contras attacked 58
times in the period May 1-15. So far this year, he said, the
Contras had killed 47 civilians, wounded 38 and kidnapped 131.
   He said the army had suffered 309 casualties and the Contras 707
since Jan. 1, but did not give a breakdown of dead and wounded.
   The letter to Baker said the ``account of actions against my
country is more than enough to show that your government's current
policy is not contributing toward peace in Central America.''
   Wilfredo Montalvan, a member of the Nicaraguan Resistance
directorate, denied the letter's claims.
   ``The Sandinista regime has always wanted to present the civil
war, which is now suspended, as Yankee aggression,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Miami. The Sandinistas use ``that old
tactic ... every time they find themselves in difficulties'' and
want to avoid fulfilling the peace agreement, Montalvan said.
   Contra spokesman Jorge Rosales, also in Miami, said 2,000-3,000
rebels remain in Nicaragua and have been ``strictly observing the
cease-fire.'' He claimed the Sandinista army attacked rebels and
their sympathizers, but he would not give casualty figures.
   Talavera said any aid not intended to dismantle the Contras goes
against the will of the presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala and serves to continue the war.
   The presidents signed a regional peace pact Feb. 14 in El
Salvador in which Nicaragua promised more democracy and also agreed
to draft a plan by May 15 to disband the Contras, most of whom are
in neighboring Honduras.
   At the request of President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador,
the deadline was extended until an unspecified date in July after
the inauguration of his successor, Alfredo Cristiani.

<HEAD>Senators Urge Bush to Ask Gorbachev to Clarify Soviet Commitment

<TEXT>
   All 19 members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee urged President Bush on Wednesday to ask Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to clarify the Soviet commitment to the treaty
banning medium-range nuclear-armed missiles worldwide.
   The senators said they were disturbed by a recent remarks by
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that the Soviets might
not dismantle their SS-23 medium-range missiles as required by the
treaty if NATO nations modernize their short-range nuclear weapons.
   Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan., an organizer of the
letter-writing effort, noted that the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces treaty does not ban short-range missiles with a range under
300 miles.
   Therefore, she said, modernization by NATO of such short-range
missiles would not violate the treaty.
   ``We find these remarks very troubling,'' the committee members
told Bush.
   ``Mr. Shevardnadze's suggestion that the Soviets might not abide
by the terms of the treaty in response to the modernization of
systems which are not covered by the treaty, threatens to challenge
the integrity of the INF accord, as well as overall confidence in
the arms control process,'' they said.
   It is in ``neither side's interest at this time to challenge
that agreement,'' the senators said. ``Both sides should instead be
building on the achievements of the INF accord and moving forward
to take advantage of the many promising opportunities before us in
East-West relations.''
   The senators urged the president ``to seek a clarification from
General Secretary Gorbachev as to the Soviets' commitments to the
INF accord and to consult with us on these developments.''
   The Senate ratified the INF treaty on a 93-5 roll call last year
after a lengthy debate.

<HEAD>Editor Sees `Soviet Watergate' in Corruption Crusade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior editor on Wednesday likened a corruption
scandal to a Soviet Watergate and said it has stirred Soviet
popular opinion.
   But Yegor Yakovlev, editor of the weekly Moscow News, warned in
his column against ``unjust methods'' to obtain ``just results.''
   ``Passions are inflamed. Could it be that our own home-grown
Watergate is starting to burn?'' Yakovlev asked, referring to the
scandal surrounding two criminal investigators who have mentioned
former members of the ruling Politburo in an inquiry into
corruption.
   One investigator, Nikolai Ivanov, said on Friday that the name
of Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev also came up in the inquiry.
He did not go into details.
   Ligachev has denied the allegations and called the statement
slanderous and ``a political provocation,'' the Novosti press
agency said Tuesday. Ivanov is being investigated in the Supreme
Soviet Presidium for alleged abuses of power.
   Yakovlev's column focused on crime-fighter Telman Gdlyan,
Ivanov's boss. Gdlyan and Ivanov gained national fame in their
clean-up of a corruption case that began with an Uzbek collective
farm chairman and spread to include top regional officials and the
son-in-law of late Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   A Supreme Court probe found that in a separate case in 1983,
Gdlyan helped convict an innocent man, an eminent Estonian
scientist who died in prison. The court has asked the prosecutor's
office to consider dismissing Gdlyan.
   But the people are behind Gdlyan, Yakovlev said.
   ``As I write these lines, under the windows of the editorial
offices the crowd is whistling, and from hand to hand passes a
petition not to remove the investigator from the work he has
already begun,'' he wrote.
   And when Yakovlev said at a public meeting that he could not
forgive Gdlyan for his handling of Johannes Hint, the Estonian
scientist, he was drowned out by the whistles, stamping and
shouting of the irritated crowd.
   Yakovlev protested that the Soviet public must learn that ``we
mustn't obtain just results with unjust methods.''
   ``We've all come out of decades of lawlessness. They cost us so
dearly that people are prepared to fight lawlessness on the
principle that any means are all right,'' he wrote.
   Yakovlev emphasized that Gdlyan was not the only one to blame
for Hint's death: He came onto the case late, and the court
convicted Hint.

   Police arrested five men and
recovered millions of dollars worth of art stolen from a museum
this month, including works by Salvador Dali and Henri Matisse, a
police officer said Wednesday.
   Alvaro Luis Souza, who commanded the raid leading to the
arrests, said officers, responding to an anonymous phone tip
Tuesday night, raced to an apartment building in Rio's Botafogo
neigborhood.
   They staked out the apartment and apprehended a man as he was
leaving the building, Souza said. The stolen goods were discovered,
undamaged, inside the apartment.
   Souza said four other men were arrested hours later.
   Police still are searching for three more men who they believe
were involved in the May 3 robbery of the Chacara do Ceu Museum,
Souza said. Six men took part in the actual robbery, and police
believe they had two accomplices.
   Souza said police had recovered all the stolen art except two
Chinese ceramic sculptures from the 7th century and a collection of
silverware.
   Among the works recovered were:
   _A 1929 painting by the late Spanish surrealist Dali, ``Les Deux
Balcons,'' or ``The Two Balconies.'' It was the only Dali on public
display in Brazil.
   _A 1905 painting, ``Le Jardin du Luxembourg,'' or ``Luxembourg
Garden,'' by Matisse, the 20th century French post-impressionist.
   _Three works by the late Candido Portinari, one of Brazil's most
important contemporary artists, including ``O Sonho,'' meaning
``The Dream,'' and ``As Lavadeiras,'' or ``The Washerwomen.''
   At the time of the robbery Marcio Fortes, the museum's director,
estimated the total value of the works stolen at $30-$40 million.
   The museum, suffering financial problems, had insured the works
only in case of fire.
   The museum was robbed when the gunmen _ disguised as police
officers _ tied up three employees and fled with the art.
   The museum had been the residence of the late Brazilian
industrialist Raymundo Ottoni de Castro Maya, who left his home and
collection to the nation.
   The collection, opened to the public in 1972, includes
paintings, sculptures, silverware, furniture and other objects.

course work for his bachelor of laws degree through the University
of South Africa, one of the largest correspondence schools in the
world.
   The degree was awarded in his absence at a ceremony at Cape Town
City Hall while Mandela remained incarcerated in a house at the
Victor Verster Prison Farm near Paarl, 30 miles to the northeast.
   University spokesman Chip Joubert said Mandela was invited but
returned the form, saying he would be unable to attend. Joubert
said the diploma would be mailed.
   Mandela's name was listed on the eighth page of a glossy program
handed to the 1,000 people who attended the graduation, but his
name was not read out.
   Three bachelor of law degrees were awarded and one recipient,
Shaun Sheehan, 30, was present. Sheehan said he had been in the
room next to Mandela when Mandela was treated at Tygerberg Hospital
last year for tuberculosis. Sheehan said he was ``a bit sad''
Mandela could not attend the ceremony.
   Mandela received a bachelor of arts degree through
correspondence courses in 1941 and worked as an attorney in
Johannesburg through the early 1950s. His law partner was Oliver
Tambo, who went into exile when the ANC was outlawed in 1960 and is
now president of the guerrilla organization.
   An attorney without a law degree can represent clients, advise
them, take care of legal documents for them, file suits and the
like, but cannot argue before the high courts where most major
cases are decided.
   A bachelor of laws degree would allow Mandela to become an
advocate and argue major cases before the regional Supreme Courts
if he were not in prison.
   Mandela was sentenced to life in prison in 1964 for sabotage and
conspiracy to topple the white-minority government. At the time, he
had been in prison for three years for incitement and leaving the
country illegally.
   Marinus Weichers, head of the department of constitutional law
at the university, said Mandela ``is a very good, accomplished
lawyer.''
   Mandela family friend and biographer Fatima Meer said Mandela
had difficulty getting the right reference books and had to study
under trying circumstances. ``The fact that he has accomplished his
LLB degree is an indication of the capacity he has to cling on to
hope,'' she said.
   ``Very few people have that kind of faith and the ability to
transform that gift into reality. That is the reason why we want
him out, and that is the reason why we want him to head the
country.''

<HEAD>House Postpones Action on Bill Bearing Veterans, Anti-Drug Funds</HEAD>

   The House postponed action until next week on
a multi-billion dollar domestic spending bill when Democrats and
Republicans became embroiled Wednesday in a dispute over anti-drug
spending.
   The stall occurred despite outcries from the Bush
administration, lawmakers and veterans groups that $340 million in
the measure for veterans health programs was needed as soon as
possible.
   The dispute began when House Appropriations Committee Chairman
Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., attempted to bring a $3.7 billion
supplemental spending bill for this year to the House floor.
   Republicans blocked Whitten with a procedural move, with Rep.
Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican on the House Budget
Committee, arguing that the measure would be ``veto bait.''
   Bush administration officials have said they would urge the
president to veto the bill unless $822 million it contains for
anti-drug programs is removed.
   Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, ranking Republican on the
Appropriations Committee, offered a bill bearing only the $340
million for veterans, but majority Democrats refused to allow it to
be debated.
   Democrats claimed Republicans simply don't want to put extra
federal muscle into efforts to crack down on illegal drug
trafficking.
   ``There's only one thing holding up this'' bill, said Rep. Neal
Smith, D-Iowa, chairman of the Appropriations justice subcommittee.
``The administration does not want this Congress to appropriate any
more money for crime and drugs.''
   In addition, several liberal Democrats are attempting to amend
the measure with language that would transfer about $900 million
next year from the Star Wars anti-missile program to anti-drug
initiatives.
   Secretary Edward Derwinski of the Department of Veterans Affairs
on Wednesday called the need for money ``a real emergency.'' A day
earlier, he warned in a letter that a delay in the money would mean
gradual reductions in numbers of workers, delays in purchasing
medical equipment, and a halt in construction projects.
   The House does not plan to consider the measure again until next
week. The Senate leaves town this week for a Memorial Day recess
and does not return until May 31.
   Last month, a $4.7 billion version of the spending measure had
been pulled off the House floor after objections that it was too
expensive.
   The Appropriations Committee had stripped $1 billion from it for
the costs of fighting last year's forest fires, the Federal
Aviation Administration, the homeless, public housing, reparations
to Japanese-Americans who were kept in camps during World War II,
and other programs.

<HEAD>Diplomats Call Palau's Complaints About US a Bargaining Tactic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Complaints by Palau of inadequate
development and economic dependency under U.S. administration are a
bargaining tactic to get more money from Washington, a U.N.
investigative mission said Wednesday.
   The British and French diplomats and U.N. officials who visited
Palau in April also said Soviet claims of ``militarization'' of the
Pacific archipelago were groundless.
   According to their report, ``The only United States military
presence in Palau is a small U.S. Navy detachment, the Seabees,
numbering 21 men, which is doing construction work at the request
of the local authorities.''
   Soviet diplomats, environmentalists and peace activists have
accused the Pentagon of planning to establish bases in the islands,
possibly armed with nuclear weapons.
   The investigators, sent by the U.N. Trusteeship Council, found
Palauans concerned with ``the level of compensation and the manner
in which such compensation would be negotiated rather than ... the
possible end use of the land.''
   ``As regards the `nuclear issue,' this was scarcely raised in
the course of the mission's visit,'' they said. ``In particular, it
was not brought up as a subject of major significance in any of the
mission's meetings with political leaders of all persuasions.''
   Palau is the only chain of islands still under U.N. trust
supervision.
   Vice President Kuniwo Nakamura of Palau said Monday the
territory was economically weak, with inadequate health and social
services, and the United States had failed in its duty as trustee.
   In its evaluation, the U.N. mission praised U.S. support for
political development and the archipelago's education system.
   It said of Palauan complaints about economic development and
social conditions:
   ``Among the problems frequently cited as examples were the
inadequacy of the road system, except in Koror, and the limitations
of the hospital system.
   ``In view of the considerable sums of money spent by the
administering authority in the past in the field of economic and
social development, and of additional commitments under the
proposed new status arrangements, the Mission considers that this
attitude largely reflects tactical considerations.''
   The complaints were ``aimed at obtaining additional concessions
from the U.S. executive and legislative branches at a time when
delicate negotiations have just begun between the United States
authorities'' and Palauan officials, the mission declared.
   In 1988,the 15,000 people of Palau received about $33 million in
U.S. aid. Jean-Michel Gaussot of France and J. Stephen Smith of
Britain led the mission for the Trusteeship Council, which is
evaluating Palau's progress toward adopting the proposed Compact of
Free Association with the United States.
   That agreement would make the islands self-governing but leave
the United States in charge of defense, with the right to use land
for any purpose it deemed necessary in exchange for $1 billion in
aid over 75 years. About $460 million of the U.S. aid would be paid
in the first 15 years.
   U.S. officials deny planning to establish military bases. Last
year, however, Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the joint chiefs,
told a congressional committee Palau would be ``one of the first or
priority areas we would have to look at'' if the United States lost
its bases in the Philippines.
   Palau's constitution bars nuclear weapons and nuclear power from
its territory. A majority of Palauans have favored the Compact in
several referendums, but it has not won the 75 percent needed to
overrule the constitutional ban.
   The United States captured the archipelago and other Pacific
islands from Japan in World War II. It consists of 200 islands,
totaling 192 square miles, about 500 miles east of the Philippine
island of Mindanao.

   The president of the University of Utah on
Wednesday defended the school's room-temperature fusion claims,
saying there is only a 1 percent chance they are, as skeptics say,
the result of laboratory error.
   Chase Peterson told state legislators that scientists have
failed to disprove the claims of chemists Martin Fleischmann and
Stanley Pons, who contend they have sustained nuclear fusion in a
tabletop experiment.
   Peterson said others have failed to duplicate the results
because the experiment is difficult and takes time.
   ``There has been no disproving data,'' Peterson said. ``The work
has been described as simple, but it's really very difficult
electrochemistry.'''
   In separate state House and Senate appearances, university
officials said Pons, a Utah professor, and Fleischmann, of the
University of Southampton, in England, continue to report dramatic
results.
   James Brophy, the university's vice president for research, said
the experiment produces 100 times the energy needed to run it.
Pons' goal is a 1,000-to-1 ratio, Brophy said.
   When they announced their discovery at a March 23 news
conference, Pons and Fleischmann said they had achieved 4-to-1
ratio.
   Levels have been boosted by a change in the apparatus,
specifically an increase in the size of the palladium electrode,
Brophy said.
   Legislators, who last month voted overwhelmingly to appropriate
$5 million to support the research, offered no criticism of the
claims.
   Peterson said a small portion of the $5 million has been spent
on patent research and applications. The rest is in escrow until an
independent panel of scientists and businessmen decides the
experiment has been confirmed.
   Pons and Fleischmann have been derided by other scientists for
their claim. If fusion, which powers the sun, can be created at
room temperature, it could be a cheap and safe source of energy.
   Peterson said Pons and Fleischmann must ignore the public debate
and focus on their research. Without elaborating, he dismissed the
chance of fundamental laboratory errors as a 1 in 100 possibility.
   Peterson also said private corporations continue to show a
strong interest in the project, with 45 companies having e signed
confidential disclosure agreements that permit them to review the
school's patent applications.
   He declined to identify any of the companies except
Westinghouse, which has acknowledged sending its officials to the
Utah campus to review the project.

   British airports and airlines have been alerted to
watch out for containers of marzipan candy that could contain
Semtex plastic explosive, the Transport Department said Wednesday.
   The department said in a statement that the alert followed the
discovery of a brand of Middle East marzipan containing Semtex. It
gave no other details about the find.
   Investigators say Semtex is thought to have been used in the
bomb built into a radio-cassette player that destroyed Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, last Dec. 21. All 259 people
on the New York-bound plane and 11 on the ground were killed.
   Semtex is made in Czechoslovakia. It is odorless, hard to detect
and can be molded into any shape.

   Punishing thunderstorms lashed Texas for the second day in a row
Wednesday with tornadoes and heavy rain, destroying 45 homes and 16
businesses, causing floods, and forcing the evacuation of hundreds
of people.
   Rains that drenched the Middle Atlantic States subsided, but
flooding forced the evacuation of dozens of northern New Jersey
residents and closed three major highways in the New York City area.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell across much of the
Plains, southern Missouri, Arkansas and the southern Rockies. Rain
showers fell along the Washington state coast.
   Thunderstorms, which pounded northern Texas on Tuesday, on
Wednesday hit much of the state's midsection.
   Tornadoes were reported in Winona and near Malakoff, Athens and
Jarrell, and damaging winds struck in Frankston and near Teaseville.
   In Jarrell, a town of 1,000 people about 40 miles north of
Austin, a twister destroyed 33 houses, 12 mobile homes and 16
businesses, and damaged 39 houses, said state emergency official
David Barham.
   At least six tractor-trailer rigs overturned on nearby
Interstate 35.
   Near Round Rock almost 20 miles north of Austin, rain and high
winds tore siding off an elementary school and damaged more than a
dozen homes. The school's 400 pupils were evacuated to a high
school.
   The storms dumped 5 inches of of rain on Lake Palestine in one
hour and 4 inches in Freestone County in two hours. More than 9
inches fell in Robinson, and 2 to 4 inches were common across
central Texas.
   In Dallas, the Trinity River was more than 5 feet above flood
stage and was still rising. Police, firefighters and others
escorted people from flooding neighborhoods.
   Rising water pushed a mobile home in Village Creek downstream to
a bridge, and flooding closed I-35 in Waco and Interstate 45 in
Navarro County and roads in and out of Blum. Homes in Corsicana had
3 feet of water, and flooding was widespread in McClennan and
Limestone counties.
   Flash flood watches remained in effect in central Texas, as well
as in southern Oklahoma and western Louisiana.
   Texas' Panhandle got golf ball-size hail southwest of Muleshoe
and in Lariat. The hail was so deep west of Muleshoe that cars
couldn't move.
   In West Palm Beach, Fla., the temperature climbed to a record 94
records. The old record for the date of 93 had was set in 1954 and
tied in 1985.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 44
degrees in Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 96 degrees in
Harlingen, McAllen and Kingsville, Texas.
   The nation's low Wednesday morning was 29 degrees in Truckee,
Calif.
   Thursday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms across
eastern sections of the Plains states, the Mississippi Valley and
central Gulf Coast, with strong thunderstorms possible across
eastern Texas and Oklahoma, the lower Mississippi Valley and
southwest Missouri; scattered rain showers from the northern
Pacific Coast to the northern Rockies, with snow at higher
elevations; and mostly sunny skies in the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 50s and 60s along the
Pacific Coast and the northern Intermountain region; the 60s in
northern Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin, and along the New
England coast; the 90s across the central and southern Florida
Peninsula, the desert Southwest, inland California valleys and near
the Big Bend of the Rio Grande in southwest Texas; and in the 70s
and 80s in the rest of the nation.

   An emigre source said Wednesday that
prominent Romanian dissident Doina Cornea was beaten by Romanian
police and told she will never get a visa for France to attend a
conference on human rights next month.
   Mrs. Cornea, 59, a historian, disappeared from public view late
last month after accusing President Nicolae Ceausescu of imposing
on his fellow Romanians a repressive and outdated brand of
communism ``which people can't endure any longer.''
   The Paris-based Romanian League of Human Rights said an
unidentified foreign diplomat spotted her on May 12 in her hometown
of Cluj, western Romania. The organization monitors human rights in
Romania.
   Mihnea Berindei, a league spokesman, said it was not clear where
she had been during the time she disappeared from her home.
   Police cars block both ends of the street where she lives in
Cluj and her telephone has been cut off, Berindei said.
   ``Cornea was beaten up by police, spat at and told she will
never get a visa for France,'' Berindei told The Associated Press
in Vienna by telephone.
   Mrs. Cornea, a former professor of French, lost her job at Cluj
University in 1983 for protesting Ceausescu's economic and cultural
policies.
   Last week, the Foreign Ministry in Paris summoned Romania's
ambassador to France, Petre Gigea, to lodge a formal complaint
about human rights abuses and to demand that Romania stop harassing
dissidents.
   A ministry official provided Gigea with a copy of a letter sent
on May 10 by French first lady Danielle Mitterrand to Ceausescu and
his wife asking for assurance Mrs. Cornea would be allowed to leave
Romania to attend the June conference in France.
   Mrs. Mitterrand, wife of President Francois Mitterrand, is
president of the France-Liberty Foundation human rights group and
sent the letter in that capacity.
   Mrs. Cornea last year called on Ceausescu to stop a huge village
demolition project intended to gain more farmland for use by
state-owned collective farms.
   In her letter to Ceausescu last month, she said, ``You humbled
the people's conscience, forcing them, through pressure and terror,
to accept lies as truth and truth as lies.''

   Milan Pancevski took over Wednesday
as chief of the ruling Communist Party in place of Stipe Suvar, who
resigned to take a seat in the country's collective state
presidency.
   The change took place at a plenary session of the party's
policy-setting Central Committee meeting to discuss the tense
situation in Yugoslavia's strife-torn southern province of Kosovo.
   Pancevski, 54, from the southern republic of Macedonia, will
head the party until June next year in accordance with the
country's practice of rotating top state and party jobs annually.
   Suvar, whose one-year term as party leader was to expire in
June, now represents the republic of Croatia in the eight-member
state presidency. A party regulation adopted last year forbids
officials from holding state and party jobs simultaneously.
   The state presidency is the collective head of Yugoslavia and
oversees the country's defense, internal and foreign policies. The
party's Presidium (Politburo) decides on all major political issues.
   Last spring, the presidency imposed a state of emergency and a
curfew in Kosovo after more than 60,000 ethnic Albanians rioted
there against constitutional changes that gave the country's
largest republic of Serbia more control over Kosovo.
   At least 25 people, including three policemen, died in the
clashes between ethnic Albanians and security forces in Kosovo last
month.
   The state of emergency, the subsequent jailing of more than 800
Albanians and the fate more than 200 people who have been detained
without charges in Kosovo triggered strong criticism from
intellectual, dissident and liberal opposition groups in the
country.
   During Wednesday's session, Central Committee members clashed
over the ways to solve the crisis in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
form 85 percent of the population.
   The meeting underscored a continuing feud between liberal and
hard-line factions within the leadership.
   Nijaz Skenderagic from the central republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina told the gathering that ethnic Albanians ``have
a feeling that they are second-rate citizens in Yugoslavia'' and
criticized political persecution and isolation of Albanians in
Kosovo.
   His statements drew an angry response from senior orthodox
Serbian Communists, who rejected them as based on ``official
Albanian propaganda.''

   North Korea accused South Korean troops Wednesday
of firing on a North Korean post in the demilitarized zone between
the countries.
   ``It was entirely thanks to the patience and self-restraint of
the civil policemen of our side that this incident was not expanded
into an armed conflict between the two sides,'' Pyongyang's
official Korean Central News Agency said.
   The agency's report, monitored in Tokyo, did not mention any
injuries, but said the alleged firing ``gravely threatened'' the
safety of the North Korean policemen and destroyed equipment.
   The agency said South Korean troops fired ``scores of bullets
from automatic rifles'' at a North Korean post in the Demilitarized
Zone at around 6:38 p.m. Wednesday.
   In another report, the official news agency accused the United
States of daily ``aerial espionage'' by U-2 high-altitude
reconnaissance planes.
   The agency said the U-2s were flown along the military
demarcation line between North and South Korea and that the United
States also had brought an E-3A AWACS plane into South Korea for
spying on the North.
   It said U.S. spy planes had flown 100 such reconnaissance
missions in the first half of May, or about seven per day.
   ``This shows that the U.S. imperial aggressors persistently seek
confrontation and war on the Korean peninsula,'' the KCNA report
said.
   The Communist North and capitalist South, divided since 1945,
fought a bloody war in 1950-53.
   The two sides, which technically remain at war since no peace
treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953, reportedly
have held a series of secret talks on measures to ease tensions on
the Korean peninsula.

<TEXT>
   The former chief army psychologist faulted the
army on Wednesday for failing to develop specially trained
anti-riot forces to deal with the Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories.
   Reuven Gal, a reserve colonel who heads an independent military
study center, told reporters that despite its excellent combat
history the army was doing ``very poorly'' in coping with the
violence that has killed more than 480 Palestinians since Dec. 8,
1987.
   He said that in the 22 years since Israel seized the West Bank
and Gaza Strip from Arab control, the army never viewed controlling
the territory as a prime mission and subsequently failed to develop
special units.
   ``The mystery is how come after a year and a half of the
intefadeh (uprising) they haven't caught up,'' Gal told a
government-sponsored briefing.
   ``The Israel Defense Forces are usually very quick to adapt to
new situations with new weapons and new tactics. (But) until now
there is not a single base in the IDF where soldiers train
specifically for riot control.''
   Gal, who heads the Israel Institute for Military Studies in
Zichron Yaacov, said the army commanders resisted change because
they were combat-oriented and did not want to turn the IDF into a
police force.
   He said that because of the army's neither-nor way of handling
the intefadeh, ``in the end they come up as both immoral and
ineffective at the same time.''
   Gal, the army's chief psychologist from 1977-82, said police
duties also interfered with the motivation to be combat soldiers,
especially in the regular army.
   A U.S. State Department report on human rights criticized the
Israeli army's lack of training and experience in riot control,
saying it contributed to a high number of human rights violations.
   Col. Renaan Gissin, the army deputy spokesman, acknowledged that
the army had created no special branch to deal with riot control
and had no central base for preparing troops for duty in the
occupied lands.
   But he said the army recently deployed three new companies of
border police and three to four companies of mechanized infantry
who are specially trained to deal with civil unrest. A company
contains about 100 soldiers.
   ``It took time, nearly a year, to develop and train them,''
Gissin said in an interview.
   He said the army now gives special orientation and training to
all units that serve in occupied areas, and built models of West
Bank streets for the units to practice.
   The army, which maintained about 10,000 troops on average in the
occupied lands in 1988, was not able to develop a larger force for
the West Bank and Gaza because of ``budgetary restraints,'' Gissin
said.
   He listed the intefadeh as the army's third priority after
preparing for all-out war and guarding against terror attacks.
   The army has spent about $250 million on the uprising.

   KPLX-KLIF helicopter pilot Ken Arnold spotted the three, and he

   Siegel lifted 7-year-old Brady Laird aboard from the car's trunk
lid. Brady helped pull her 9-year-old sister Kelly aboard, WBAP
News Director Joe Halstead said.
   ``The lady then climbed on top of the car and climbed into the
copter,'' Siegel said.
   Halstead said the woman and children were stranded when she
tried to drive across the flooded bridge. They climbed on top of
their car to wait for help.

<HEAD>GAO Study Questions Actions Against INS Agents Who Wrote Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight Immigration and Naturalization Service
agents ``paid a heavy price'' in possible reprisals for their
honesty in telling Congress they were asked to falsify their time
cards, the chairman of a House panel said Wednesday.
   The General Accounting Office said it has found circumstantial
evidence that indicates that INS management retaliated against the
eight anti-smuggling unit agents and two supervisors after the
agents complained in a letter to members of Congress about
procedures at the Houston District office.
   The agents said in the September 1987 letter that they were
being assigned part of the time to contact employers about the 1986
immigration law and sanctions for hiring illegal aliens. The INS
instructed the agents to record the time spent on employer
relations as anti-smuggling hours, they said.
   The GAO probe found that after the letter surfaced, one agent
and two supervisors were pressured to take unwanted transfers. Five
agents and one supervisor received low appraisals, even though
management could not provide evidence of poor performance and all
six had been highly appraised the previous year, the investigation
found.
   ``These agents have paid a heavy price for their courage and
honesty,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, who requested the probe by GAO, the investigative branch
of Congress.
   ``This is one more example where agency management went after
the whistleblowers rather then the wrongdoers,'' the Texas Democrat
said. ``It is my understanding that INS recently has taken steps to
reinstate the Houston anti-smuggling unit and its agents. However,
I think it's time for the attorney general to consider making
immediate changes to INS management.''
   Although the GAO said it cannot make a legal determination
whether retaliation occurred, it recommended the INS commissioner
remedy ``troublesome management problems'' in Houston.
   The GAO said Houston District management was wrong to direct
anti-smuggling personnel to record employer relations hours as
anti-smuggling work. The GAO also faulted the INS Dallas office for
investigating the agents after they wrote the letter.
   The actions taken against the employees ``were inconsistent with
INS policies or were not adequately documented by INS,'' the GAO
said. ``Moreover, the timing of the actions and the lack of
adequate documentation as to why they were taken lead us to believe
they they could be the result, at least in part, of the agents'
letter.''
   Houston District Director Ronald Parra defended the actions
taken against the agents, saying the agents ``felt they were more
of the Miami Vice mode and it was beneath their dignity to educate
employers about the new legislation.''
   ``It was a very cut-and-dried situation. These officers were not
doing adequate work performance,'' Parra said. ``And statistics
corroborate that very decisively, very significantly, that they did
not follow these orders.''
   INS management officials in Houston discussed the letter in a
conference call with officials of the agency's Southern regional
office in Dallas the day the Regional Commissioner Stephen Martin
received a copy of the agents' letter, the GAO study said.
   According to a tape recording of the conversation, Parra stated:
``We don't want to come down with a heavy hand on them. We can take
care of this in a much more subtle and executive fashion.''
   Martin was ``livid at the fact these individuals had written to
their congressmen and made all these allegations'' and wanted to
fire ``the entire group,'' Parra said Wednesday. He said Martin was
from the private sector and was apparently unaware that federal
employees have a right to contact members of Congress.
   But Parra said Houston management had already been discussing
performance problems by the agents and supervisors when Martin
became aware of the letter. The Dallas office was behind
authorizing transfers of the three men, Parra said.

   Two U.S. drug agents fooled by the same
confidential informant were charged with bribery for allegedly
offering to protect drug money ``rip-offs,'' federal authorities
said Wednesday.
   Investigators described a ``Miami Vice'' plot: two longtime,
respected agents caught with the help of a double-crossing
informant in an undercover operation using wiretaps, hidden
microphones and misinformation.
   In both cases, when the agent suspects were told the informant
had been arrested, they told fellow DEA agents they were working
with the informant in undercover operations, authorities said.
   Drew Bunnell and Al Iglesias, special agents of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, appeared Wednesday before U.S.
Magistrate Peter Palermo.
   Bunnell, who had been with the DEA in Ecuador, was ordered held
without bond pending a hearing Monday and Iglesias, who lives in
Miami, was set for release on a signature bond Wednesday evening.
   A DEA official in Miami, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Bunnell had nine years' experience and Iglesias 14. Bunnell
and Iglesias are on administrative leave with pay, pending
prosecution, the official said.
   ``The reaction is one of dismay,'' said the official. ``But the
other guys go on about their jobs, putting their lives on the
line.''
   The investigation began in July 1988, authorities said, when the
unidentified informant told the DEA he had met with Bunnell in
December 1987 and discussed ``ripping off'' cocaine money.
   That began a series of DEA-monitored telephone calls between the
informant, either from Miami or an undisclosed city in South
Carolina, and Bunnell in Guayaquil, Ecuador, authorities said.
   The informant led Bunnell to believe he had taken $215,000 in
cocaine traffickers' money, authorities said. Bunnell received
$7,000 and had expected to receive $100,000, authorities said.
   On Jan. 10, a DEA agent in Savannah, Ga., called Bunnell in
Miami to say the informant had been stopped carrying large amounts
of cash but told agents he was working with Bunnell on a case,
authorities said.
   Bunnell said the informant was working with him, the DEA said.
   On April 18, the informant called Iglesias, a prominent DEA
agent in Miami, from South Carolina to say cocaine dealers there
would pay the informant $150,000 to buy cocaine for them in Miami,
authorities said.
   Iglesias told the informant he could work with the DEA or he
could keep the money himself and Iglesias would cover it up and
protect him from the cocaine dealers, investigators said.
   After many DEA-taped phone calls, authorities said, the
informant offered Iglesias $15,000. Iglesias declined, but later
accepted $700 to pay for a first-class plane ticket to Ecuador,
authorities said.
   He then agreed to get fake Metro-Dade police reports to prove to
the cocaine dealers that he had been arrested and their money
seized.
   Iglesias told the informant he wanted to be paid with an $11,000
watch, which the informant gave him on April 25, authorities said.
   On May 2, Iglesias was called by an agent in Columbus, Ga., and
told the informant had been stopped in Macon, Ga., authorities
said. Iglesias told Mallarney the informant was working with him in
an undercover operation.

   Shining Path rebels allied with drug
traffickers ambushed policemen in two areas of Peru's
coca-producing jungles, killing nine and wounding 12, a government
official said Wednesday.
   Wednesday marked the ninth anniversary of the insurgency by the
Maoist rebel group, during which more than 14,000 people have been
slain.
   In Lima, three gunmen on Wednesday killed a university professor
when he left his home for work. Officials declined to say whether
the Shining Path was behind the attack. They identified the victim
as Abelardo Ludena Luque, a professor at the National Engineering
University.
   The two attacks on policemen took place Tuesday, an Interior
Ministry spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Six policemen were killed and four wounded when rebels
affiliated with drug traffickers ambushed them on a jungle highway,
the spokesman said. The attack occurred near the town of Tocache,
266 miles northeast of Lima.
   The spokesman also said three policemen were slain and eight
were wounded Tuesday when a rebel gang ambushed their vehicle as it
approached a bridge near the city of Tingo Maria, 240 miles
northeast of Lima.
   Tocache and Tingo Maria are in the heart of Peru's coca-growing
region, which is estimated to harvest about half of the world's
coca.
   The plant is semi-processed and then flown from clandestine
airstrips to Colombia, where it is refined into cocaine for sale in
the United States and Europe.
   The Shining Path began its insurgency on May 17, 1980 by burning
election material in the Andean province of Ayacucho. The attack
came on the eve of elections that put an end to 12 years of
military dictatorship.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ An explosion erupted as a crowd
gathered on a plaza for holiday celebrations, injuring nine people,
independent Radio Haiti Inter said Wednesday.
   Police made no statement on the cause of the explosion Tuesday
night and could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
   Most of the victims suffered minor injuries, but a 25-year-old
woman underwent surgery and remained in serious condition, the
radio station said.
   The explosion occurred on the central Champ de Mars Plaza, near
the National Palace. The injured were taken to the State University
Hospital a few blocks from the scene.
   The crowd had gathered at the Occide Jeanty bandstand in the
plaza for official pre-Flag Day festivities featuring groups of
young singers and artists. Radio Haiti Inter said the explosion
occurred near the crowd, but did not elaborate.
   Flag Day, scheduled to take place Thursday, is a national
holiday in Haiti and commemorates the creation of Haiti's red and
blue flag in 1803, a year before the Caribbean nation won its war
of independence from France.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a rejection of reforms that
have changed much of the Soviet bloc, Romanian and Czechoslovak
leaders on Wednesday said each nation's Communist Party should
decide its own political course.
   The statement by Communist Party leader Milos Jakes and Romanian
President Nicolae Ceausescu was issued by the official news agency
CTK during Ceausescu's one-day visit to Prague.
   The new problems facing communism require ``the building of
relations between parties on the basis of equality, independence
and the right of each party to work out its own political line ...
without any external interference,'' the statement said.
   It signaled a rejection of reforms that have changed political
life in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union. It closely followed a
visit to Prague by East German leader Erich Honecker, who also has
criticized political changes begun under Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Both Czechoslovakia and Romania have bad relations with their
neighbor Hungary, and the statement emphasized that foreign
Communist parties should not interfere in domestic affairs.
   There was no indication that Jakes had raised human rights
issues with Ceausescu, who runs the most repressive government in
the East bloc.
   The human rights group Charter 77 wrote an open letter to Jakes
before the visit urging him to discuss Romania's record, which is
increasingly attacked in the West and in Hungary.
   Czechoslovakia's ties with Hungary have soured recently over
Budapest's decision to halt work on a joint dam project and an
unprecedented Hungarian television interview with former Communist
Party leader Alexander Dubcek.
   Prague officially protested to Budapest over the decision to
halt work on the Nagymaros dam and power station on the Danube
River, demanding that the project be completed.
   Czechoslovakia has invested $1.1 billion in constructing a
nearly completed companion dam at Gabcikovo, 40 miles east of
Bratislava.
   Hungarian-Romanian relations are even more strained because of
Romania's treatment of the estimated 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians
who live on its territory.
   In January 1988, Hungary took the unprecedented step of breaking
an agreement and refusing to send home Romanian citizens who sought
refuge in Hungary. An estimated 50,000 people, mostly ethnic
Hungarians who claim discrimination in Romania, have done so.

Fear</HEAD>

<TEXT>
     Kurt Carlson, who was severely beaten by the hijackers of TWA
Flight 847 four years ago, says the sentencing Wednesday of
Mohammed Ali Hamadi makes him ``really glad they're going to put
that guy away.''
   A West German court in Frankfurt convicted Hamadi in the
hijacking and the brutal beating and murder of Navy diver Robert
Stethem, 23, of Waldorf, Md., then sentenced the 24-year-old
terrorist to life in prison.
   Flight 847 was seized on June 14, 1985, after the Boeing 727
took off from Athens for Rome. The plane flew twice to Algiers and
three times to Beirut on the hijackers' orders. Thirty-nine
Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   Hamadi received the maximum sentence under West German law, but
Navy Lt. j.g. Stuart Dahl, 35, of Port Hueneme, Calif., who was
traveling with Stethem when the plane was hijacked, said the
terrorist deserved a sterner fate.
   Dahl told Fargo, N.D., radio station WDAY that Hamadi should
have been extradited to the United States to stand trial and should
have been sentenced to death.
   ``He deserved to be treated like a terrorist and die a
terrorist's death _ violently,'' the Thief River Falls, Minn.,
native, said.
   Three San Franciscans who were passengers on Flight 847 said
they feared that West Germany would be pressured to release him.
   ``We have very strong reason to believe that the West Germans
have made a deal for an early release _ or at least have led
Hamadi's family and supporters in Beirut to think so,'' Mauri
Schwartz told a news conference in San Francisco attended by fellow
passengers Dino Cucchi and his wife, Loretta.
   Reading a statement by the three, Ms. Schwartz said recent
kidnappings and releases of West Germans in Lebanon appeared to be
connected to Hamadi's case.
   ``We are satisfied that this verdict and sentence are
appropriate punishment for his crimes and for that we breathe a
sigh of relief,'' she said.
   ``We ask the West German government to abide by the court's
decision and keep Hamadi in prison for the rest of his life. We ask
the U.S. government to insist on this in every aspect of our
foreign policy.
   ``If he does get to go back, he will do it again,'' Ms. Schwartz
said, speaking for herself.
   A West German prosecutor, Peter Korneck, said Hamadi will be
eligible for parole review in 15 years. Defense attorneys said they
expected to appeal the sentence.
   Like Stethem, Carlson was singled out by the terrorists for
especially brutal treatment. The Rockford, Ill., businessman was
returning from Army Reserve duty in the Middle East and was
carrying a government passport.
   ``I'm really glad they're going to put that guy away,'' he said
in a telephone interview Wednesday from a college alumni outing at
Myrtle Beach, S.C.
   ``He really didn't seem to care if all of us died or not,'' said
Carlson, 42. ``He deserved the worst punishment there is for what
he did, not just to me but to Robert Stethem and all the passengers
and the crew.''
   The Rev. James McLoughlin of Geneva, Ill., one of three priests
leading Illinois Roman Catholics who were returning from a
pilgrimage to the Holy Land aboard Flight 847, said he was glad the
death penalty was not an option.
   ``That would just continue the anger, the chain reaction of
retribution,'' McLoughlin said.
   ``This is kind of a period to the whole thing,'' said Evelyn
Balt, 74, of Oswego, Ill. ``Maybe now they'll let it die. You think
you've put it completely out of your mind, and then something like
this comes up and brings it all back again.''

   Prime Minister James Mitchell won
a second term in office and his party swept all 15 seats in this
tiny Caribbean island's parliament, election officials said
Wednesday.
   Mitchell's New Democratic Party previously held 10 of the 13
seats in Parliament, which has been expanded to 15 seats.
   The opposition St. Vincent Labor Party lost all three of its
seats, including that of its leader, Vincent Beache.
   Mitchell, 58, is a leading proponent of unity among the four
English-speaking Windward islands: St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Dominica
and Grenada.
   He vowed to give new impetus to the unity movement after his
re-election by pushing for a referendum on the issue in the four
island nations.
   Carnival-like celebrations broke out shortly after midnight when
the final results were announced.
   Mitchell, who first came to office in 1984, made Wednesday a
public holiday to celebrate his victory, and the governing party
held a rally in downtown Kingstown on Wednesday afternoon.
   Several mock funerals were staged throughout the island by
Mitchell's supporters to portray the death of the Labor Party.
   The Electoral Office said 71.8 percent of St. Vincent's 61,046
registered voters participated in Tuesday's balloting.
   The New Democrats received 66 percent of the popular vote, and
the Labor Party received 30 percent. Two tiny parties received 4
percent.
   St. Vincent, which lives mostly from banana exports, has a
population of 110,000. It gained independence from Britain in 1979.

<TEXT>
   A fact-finder's report Wednesday urged
striking teachers to end the 3-day-old walkout that has crippled
education for more than a half-million students in the nation's
second-largest school district.
   The report concluded the Los Angeles Unified School District's
offer ``will provide a teacher compensation package which is among
the best in Los Angeles County, the state of California and in the
entire United States.''
   The teachers had contended the district was top-heavy with
administrators and concealing it financial reserves, but the report
concluded that the district spends less on administrators and
wasn't hiding surplus funds.
   The report said the district spends only 4.95 percent of its
total expense on salaries for administrators; the average in the 20
largest unified school district's in California is 6.3 percent.
   The report was prepared by lawyer Geraldine Randall, who began
investigating the dispute last March when the 16-month contract
negotiation reached an impasse.
   She was selected jointly by the Los Angeles Unified School
District and the teachers' union, but Wayne Johnson, president of
United Teacher-Los Angeles dismissed the conclusions, saying the
author was biased against teachers.
   ``If they (district officials) stand firm, the strike will
continue,'' he said.
   School board president Roberta Weintraub said the ``totally
exonerates the board of education ... and I urge each and every
teacher to go back to work. ''
   Weintraub said 60,000 copies of the report would be printed for
the striking teachers. She urged teachers to read the report and
return to work.
   On Tuesday, district spokeswoman Diana Munatones said the report
would serve as a focal point for both sides to return to the
bargaining table.
   Fact finders ``look at all the facts, listen to the arguments of
both parties and then basically come up with a recommended
decision,'' said Dennis Batchelder of the state Public Employment
Relations Board. ``In other words it's advisory, it's not a binding
decision.''
   Weintraub and Johnson have said money was the main issue holding
up an agreement, which neither expected before Friday.
   Johnson said the number of striking teachers is growing along
with the percentage of the district's 594,000 students who are
staying away from school.
   Morning attendance reports Wednesday showed 287,750 students
present out of a possible 552,597. The district said 8,207 regular
teachers came to work, along with 10,399 certified substitutes and
administrators.
   The district said about 11,250 regular teachers came to work
Tuesday, 1,000 more than Monday.
   Striking teachers account for almost two-thirds of the
district's 32,000-member workforce. Johnson claimed 23,000
teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians were honoring the
picket lines.
   Teachers are demanding a 21 percent pay increase in two years.
They also want relief from unpaid duties such as playground patrol,
and greater control over curricula and how money is spent.
   The district most recently offered a 21.5 percent pay increase
over three years. It also has offered to set up councils at
individual schools so that teachers would have more say in setting
curricula.
   District teachers earn from $23,440 in beginning salary to
$43,319 for those with doctorates, 98 extra course units and 19
years' experience.

   The Soviet Union completed the pullout of a tank
division from East Germany on Wednesday as part of a troop
reduction plan announced by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   East Germany's state-run news agency ADN said 20 tanks were
loaded onto flatbed railroad cars for transport back to Soviet
territory.
   The pullout of the division's last regiment located near
Jueterbog is part of a plan announced by Gorbachev in December
under which 50,000 troops and 5,000 tanks are to be withdrawn from
Eastern Europe.
   In all, 10,000 Soviet soldiers, 4,000 tanks and 137 aircraft are
to be removed from East Germany by the end of 1990.
   ADN said Wednesday was the deadline for removing all the
regiment's type T-64 tanks.

   More than 1 million jubilant people swarmed into
central Beijing on Wednesday to shout their support for students
who are fasting for democracy. It was the largest show of defiance
in Communist China's 40-year history.
   More than 75,000 students took to the streets at least two dozen
other cities, a clear sign the pro-democracy movement has taken on
a nationwide scope.
   Early Thursday, banner-waving soldiers, doctors, workers and
students clogged Beijing's main streets as they headed for
Tiananmen Square, where the students have been camped since
Saturday demanding a dialogue with the government. But the marchers
were far fewer than on Wednesday.
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and other senior officials
visited students hospitalized in the 5-day-old hunger strike for
democracy. An announcer on a student-rigged loudspeaker said Zhao,
Premier Li Peng and Qiao Shi, who is in charge of party discipline,
made a 4 a.m. visit to one hospital, and student leaders said
Education Minister Li Tieying visited another.
   Qiao was quoted as telling one weakened faster, ``It's best you
go back to class.''
   Doctors said at least 2,000 students were taken to hospitals by
early Thursday. Many returned to the square after being revived.
   The massive yet peaceful displays of grass-roots unity put more
pressure on the government to resolve an impasse with the
student-led movement, which has gained broadening support among the
rest of the populace.
   The catalyst for the demonstrations is the 3,000 students who
began staging the hunger strike Saturday, timing their protest to
coincide with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's historic trip
to China.
   ``Delay means death!'' read one of the hundreds of banners
carried through Tiananmen during the gigantic march, which was
dominated by workers rather than students for the first time since
the pro-democracy rallies began April 15.
   Government and party officials met Wednesday with two student
representatives. The students said later they were optimistic an
agreement would be reached quickly on their demands, which include
a formal meeting with authorities broadcast live on television.
   Students early Wednesday had rejected an appeal by Zhao for an
end to the strike, although he promised ``concrete measures'' to
advance democracy.
   A deluge of letters and petitions demanding the goverment make
concessions poured into government offices from professors,
artists, youth groups and China's normally silent non-communist
parties. Some members of Parliament joined the protest.
   Astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, who is China's most famous dissident
but has kept a low profile during the protests, said in an
interview with Hong Kong television that some leaders should step
down. He did not say who should resign but indicated he felt it
should be Premier Li and senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Beijing residents on foot, bicycle, pedicab and bus flocked
throughout the day to Tiananmen, the symoblic center of power in
China, to support the hunger striking students.
   The protesters _ whose numbers included government employees and
even soldiers _ filled the 100-acre square and marched down the
streets of central Beijing, chanting slogans and singing.
   Police did not try to stop the demonstration and even helped
clear the streets for ambulances that shuttled weakened fasters to
the city's hospitals every few minutes. They also guarded shops
against looting as the demonstration extended into the night.
   The last time such huge crowds converged on Tiananmen was during
the radical leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when frenzied Red
Guards gathered to hear pronouncements from Mao Tse-tung.
   Gorbachev, who was in the Great Hall of the People next to
Tiananmen Square for much of the day, said in an interview on
Chinese television. ``All these rallies made us nervous,'' but
added that his trip was going well.
   He came to China to normalize ties after a 30-year rift.
   Gorbachev told a news conference he spoke with some student
leaders and received a ``warm letter'' from the students, who
support his reforms in the Soviet Union. Before flying to Shanghai
on Thursday, Gorbachev urged a negotiated settlement of the crisis
but did not take sides in the dispute. He called it an internal
matter.
   Demonstrations grew Wednesday in Shanghai, where at least 70
student hunger-strikers lay in front of city hall while nearly
30,000 students gathered to chant for the resignation of Shanghai
Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, an American witness said.
   State-run Xinhua News Agency, in an unusually frank report, said
marches were held Tuesday and Wednesday in more than 23 other
cities, including Canton, Xian, Tianjin, Wuhan, Jinan and Hefei.
Nearly 30,000 students paraded through the main streets of Nanjing,
capital of coastal Jiangsu province, it added.
   Thousands also protested in Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu
province, said an American witness who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Hong Kong television identified other cities where
demonstrations were held as Fuzhou, Guiyang, Guilin, Qingdao,
Xiamen Huizhou, Harbin, Shenyang, Guizhou, Chengdu and Chongqing.
   The Beijing march included factory workers, high school
students, dancers, farmers and at least 1,000 soldiers, some
wearing yellow-and-green camouflage uniforms.
   Some marching postal workers said they were on strike, and there
were unconfirmed rumors of other walkouts, although most laborers
said they would be back on the job Thursday.
   Protesters chanted slogans denouncing official profiteering and
corruption, and called for the resignation of Li and Deng. ``Li
Peng, step down!,'' they shouted.

   Government hospitals in New Delhi and
four other cities turned away thousands of people Wednesday,
accepting only emergency cases because of a strike by junior
doctors.
   Feroze Begum, a diabetic, said she traveled more than 12 miles
``in the hot sun to get a refill of my prescription, but there is
no doctor to authorize it'' at the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.
   At least 3,500 doctors at New Delhi's 11 government hospitals
began a strike Tuesday after talks with Health Ministry officials
broke down. They were joined by more than 1,400 at hospitals at
Chandigarh, Pondicherry, Banaras and Aligarh.
   Nearly all the strikers are residents. Senior doctors are
handling emergency cases.
   Striking doctors demand a raise of about $53 in monthly pay that
ranges from $200 to $270 and want monthly compensation for not
conducting private practice raised from $16 to $40.
   Dr. Rohit Parashar, a strike leader, said the doctors had
received no communication from the government since the deadlock
Monday night.
   Hospitals generally were turning away half the people who
arrived for tratment.
   Only 588 beds were occupied at the 1,493-bed Lok Nayak
Jayaprakash Narayan hospital, New Delhi's largest. Lok Nayak and
the other hospitals discharged most of their patients Monday night
after negotiations failed.

   A man upset over failing to gain admission to a
graduate school program 14 years ago has been arrested for making
more than 50,000 harassing phone calls to a professor since then,
police said Wednesday.
   Yoshikazu Hayashi, 39, a forestry office employee in western
Kyoto, was arrested on charges of intimidation after he admitted
making the calls, a police official said.
   Every night between 8 p.m. and 2 a.m., he made about 10 calls to
Tsunahide Shitei, a former professor at Kyoto University, the
official said. Shitei's wife, Yoshiko, told The Associated Press
her family received more than 100 calls each on Saturdays and
Sundays.
   In some calls, Hayashi made such remarks as ``I'll set fire to
your house,'' or ``How could you stand (my calls) for 14 years?''
police said.
   Asked why Shitei did not change the phone number, his wife said
it would cause a lot of trouble because of his work as a professor.
She said the couple waited so long to call the police because they
were reluctant to have Hayashi arrested.
   Shitei, 77, finally asked police to investigate in March.
   In 1974, Hayashi failed to gain admission to a graduate program
of Kyoto University's Agriculture Department, where Shitei taught.

   Two Irish soldiers from the U.N. peacekeeping
force in southern Lebanon were wounded Wednesday when a tank from
an Israeli-backed militia fired on their headquarters, U.N.
spokesman Timor Goksel said.
   He said the two were taken to a U.N. hospital in fair condition.
   Ireland has a 700-man battalion in the 5,800-member U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon.
   Goksel said a tank belonging to the South Lebanon Army militia
fired four shells at an Irish-patrolled area and one struck ``Camp
Shamrock,'' the Irish battalion's headquaters in Tibnine village,
wounding two soldiers.
   The site is two miles north of Israel's security zone, a buffer
set up in 1985 to protect Israel's northern settlements. Foreign
reports have said 1,500 Israeli soldiers patrol the strip with the
2,000-man South Lebanon Army.
   An Israeli army spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the milita fired on the U.N. position, wounding the
Irishmen, but said it did so after guerrillas hiding near Irish
headquarters shot at a South Lebanon Army base.
   The national Itim news agency said guerrillas fired
rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns. It said militia
commander Gen. Antoine Lahd apologized to the peacekeepers and said
he would investigate.
   Goksel said no firing came from the Irish base and that the
attack was unprovoked.

<TEXT>
   A court dropped charges against
American-born rancher who has been linked to the Nicaraugan rebel
supply network, one of his attorneys said Wednesday.
   John Hull was jailed Jan. 13 on charges of drug trafficking and
violating Costa Rican security. He was freed in early March after
he posted $37,000 bail, pending his trial.
   While in jail, the 69-year-old Hull had a heart attack and was
hospitalized for three weeks.
   Defense attorney Juan Jose Sobrado said the ruling by a Superior
Penal Court judge in Alajuela, just outside the capital, annulled
an earlier ruling by another court in San Carlos, about 100 miles
to the north.
   Sobrado said the Alajuela judge reportedly cited a lack of
evidence when annulling the earlier San Carlos ruling, which
ordered Hull jailed. The charges originally were filed in Alajuela,
but the case was later moved to San Carlos.
   Hull, of Evansville, Ind., has lived in Costa Rica for 20 years
and owns a ranch in San Carlos. His lawyers say he became a Costa
Rican citizen eight years ago.
   U.S. congressional witnesses have said Hull's ranch in Costa
Rica was a transshipment point for guns headed to the rebels in
Nicaragua and cocaine destined for the United States.
   Hull has denied any role in the illegal drug trade and said his
support of the Contra rebels was a patriotic gesture.
   Another attorney for Hull, Rita Herrera, said she had not
received an official copy of the court's ruling as of late
Wedensday.
   ``Officially we don't know anything, but we hope to have the
official ruling tommorrow,'' Herrera said in a telephone interview.
   Court officials in Alajuela could not be reached by telephone
for comment late Wednesday.
   Herrera said Hull's case probably would be rejudged by the San
Carlos court.
   ``It will start all over again,'' she said. ``But we are happy
for what we have achieved up to now.''

   Foreign Ministers of the Organization of
American States approved a resolution Wednesday night to send
mediators to Panama in an effort to end that country's political
crisis through a ``transfer of power.''
   The resolution also held Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega responsible for the ``grave events and abuses'' in Panama
in recent days.
   The mediators were ordered to report back by June 5 on their
mission in order to determine whether any subsequent measures are
appropriate to resolve Panama's crisis.
   The resolution asked the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala
and Trinidad, assisted by OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares,
to undertake the mission in order to secure a ``national accord''
in Panama within ``democratic mechanisms.''
   The accord is to be reached in the ``shortest period possible to
ensure the transfer of power with full respect for the sovereign
will of the Panamanian people,'' the resolution said.
   The most divisive aspect of the proceeding centered on whether a
direct reference to Noriega was appropriate.
   The initial draft resolution, prepared by a 10-nation
delegation, omitted all references to Noriega, but the United
States and other countries strongly opposed to Noriega reversed
that omission during a closed session of more than two hours,
paving the way for final approval.
   The new language warned that the ``grave events and abuses'' by
Noriega ``could unleash an escalation of violence'' in Panama.
   The decision to include the reference to Noriega was approved by
a 20-2 vote with seven delegates abstaining. The Panamanian and
Nicaraguan delegates opposed the change in wording.
   Nonetheless, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter, after
opposing the any change in the initial resolution, said he was
pleased with the overall result. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III also said he was pleased.
   The delegates reassembled in public session after their private
meeting late Wednesday to give the resolution final approval, but
that was considered a mere formality.
   The resolution was seen as a compromise between OAS factions
which had been advocating markedly different approaches to the
Panamanian crisis. One faction had advocated a hands-off policy
toward Noriega, citing OAS principles of non-intervention, and a
hard-line faction which had demanded the removal of Noriega from
power. The United States was in the latter category.
   Critics of the resolution argued that the call for a transfer of
power is largely meaningless because Noriega himself backed the
country's recent election process.
   But backers of the draft pointed out that the proposal calls for
an end to the crisis through democratic procedures.
   Noriega's candidate in the May 7 election, Carlos Duque, claimed
victory, but the results subsequently were voided by the Panamanian
Electoral Tribunal after widespread allegations of vote-rigging.
There also were brutal attacks by government agents on several of
the candidates in the election, a point noted in the draft
resolution.
   Noriega sees himself as no more than the Defense Force commander
who serves at the pleasure of a president who is the product of a
constitutional process. The first test of the resolution is whether
Noriega demonstrates a willingness to cooperate with the mediators.
   The proposal was presented by the delegations of Bolivia,
Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Jamaica, Peru, Dominican
Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
   At the Capitol, 57 members of the Senate encouraged Baker, in a
letter, to press hard for OAS action.
   ``We urge the members of the OAS to pass a resolution calling
for the immediate replacement of the Noriega regime and
installation of a democratic government in Panama which reflects
the free will of the people of that country.'' the letter said.
   Ritter argued in closed session that Panama's problems are the
product of a systematic campaign of U.S. interventionism, including
a series of economic sanctions and what he says was a $10 million
U.S. government contribution to the opposition campaign.
   As the meeting started, the United States was aligned with the
Central American countries and some Caribbean islands in calling
for a strong stand against Noriega.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Mexico and Brazil were
believed to be encouraging a more cautious approach, one that takes
into account OAS principles requiring respect for the sovereignty
of member nations.

   The chief mate aboard the Exxon Valdez
when it struck a reef in Prince William Sound and caused the
nation's worst oil spill told investigators Wednesday he thought he
would die in the accident.
   ``I don't mind telling you that at the time, I knew that my
world would never be the same again,'' said James R. Kunkel. ``I
never knew if I'd see my wife again.''
   His testimony led off the second day of a five-day National
Transportation Safety Board hearing into the cause of the March 24
accident, in which 10.9 million gallons of North Slope crude fouled
more than 700 miles of shoreline.
   The panel plans to question more than two dozen witnesses,
including Coast Guard personnel and Exxon executives. Capt. Joseph
Hazelwood, who is charged with operating a vessel while drunk, will
not testify. He faces trial June 20.
   The board's report on the cause of the accident will take up to
a year to complete.
   Kunkel said he saw no sign that Hazelwood had been drinking. He
said he talked to Hazelwood shortly after the wreck and smelled no
alcohol on his breath. ``At that time, the only scent in the air
was crude oil vapors.''
   Toxicologist Mike Peat, however, testified that Hazelwood's
blood-alcohol level may have been .22 percent at the time of the
wreck. The Coast Guard considers commercial vessel operators
legally drunk when blood alcohol measures .04 percent.
   Peat, an associate of the Sacramento, Calif., laboratory that
processed the blood samples Hazelwood produced for sobriety tests,
said the samples showed Hazelwood's blood-alcohol reading was 0.061.
   Assuming the captain did not drink alcohol from the time of the
crash until the tests were administered about 11 hours later, it
can be estimated his blood-alcohol level was .22 when the wreck
occurred, Peat said.
   A heavy drinker might not show obvious signs of intoxication,
Peat said, yet still could suffer impaired judgment and vision with
a blood-alcohol measurement of .22.
   He also said alcohol dissipates in the blood of heavy drinkers
faster than in the blood of moderate drinkers. Hazelwood has a
history of alcohol abuse.
   In testimony presented earlier Wednesday, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr.
Thomas Falkenstein said the smell of alcohol on the captain's
breath was obvious when he interviewed Hazelwood on the bridge
after the wreck.
   Falkenstein said he had not met Hazelwood previously and could
not judge whether he was intoxicated. The captain was reluctant to
submit to a urine test to detect alcohol consumption, Falkenstein
said.
   Kunkel testified that when he told the captain about the huge
loss of oil, Hazelwood replied: ``Well, this is one way to end a
career.''
   Wednesday's questioning of Kunkel focused on the crew's
activities aboard the tanker, evidence the captain had been
drinking, crew fatigue and Exxon policies.
   Kunkel said he sometimes worked 24 hours a day with little rest
and considered the odd hours just part of the job. And he suggested
the long hours were not a serious problem. ``You're talking to a
person who is used to this,'' he said. ``This is normal for me.''
   Kunkel described Gregory Cousins, the third mate who was in
charge of the vessel when it ran aground, as ``a very competent
young man'' who never complained of fatigue.
   Cousins was not certified to operate the tanker in Prince
William Sound. He said Hazelwood had left the bridge to send
messages from his office.
   Documents the NTSB has released suggest the accident could have
been a lot worse. The documents also detail drinking by the captain
on shore before the tanker left port.
   A jammed gauge led officers aboard the Exxon Valdez to believe
the vessel remained stable, and as a result Hazelwood tried to rock
the vessel free of the reef. If the tanker had not been on the
reef, ``the vessel would have capsized and sunk'' with more than 39
million gallons of oil still aboard, one document said.
   Crew members and others who testified before the panel on
Tuesday said Hazelwood smelled of alcohol but did not act drunk
before the accident. He failed sobriety tests about nine hours
after the early morning wreck March 24.
   According to the documents, the ship's radio officer, Joel
Roberson, told investigators that he met Hazelwood and the ship's
chief engineer, Jerzy Glowacki, on the afternoon of March 23 at a
bar, where they played darts and each bought one or more rounds of
drinks.
   He said Hazelwood was drinking a clear beverage, Glowacki was
drinking gin and tonic and he drank beer. Glowacki told
investigators he had three gin and tonics but did not recall how
much Hazelwood had to drink.
   Glowacki said the three left the bar about 7 p.m. and went to a
restaurant and ordered pizza. Glowacki and the radio officer agreed
each of the three men had one alcoholic drink as they waited.
   Shortly after the accident, Hazelwood told an investigator he
had a beer with lunch on March 23, a beer at the bar later in the
day, and a third beer at the restaurant. He also said he drank two
low-alcohol beers when he returned to the vessel.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today promised more troop
reductions in the Far East, saying the Sino-Soviet frontier should
become a ``border of peace,'' and urged Washington to pull its
troops out of South Korea.
   The Soviet leader, in Beijing to normalize relations after a
30-year chill, was later forced to cancel a visit to the Forbidden
City because pro-democracy demonstrators filled all the streets
surrounding the former Imperial Palace.
   Throughout Gorbachev's historic visit, Chinese officials have
been forced to constantly adjust his schedule to divert him from

Tiananmen Square.
   This afternoon, hundreds of students marched past the state

   Fewer wars were fought last year,
worldwide military spending declined and the global arms trade
leveled off, reversing the warlike trends of the 1980s, researchers
said today.
   The number of wars fell from 33 to 28 and some appeared close to
a resolution by year's end, the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute said in its 1988 yearbook.
   ``There was a clear break in the pattern of a constant increase
in the number of major conflicts with which the world had grown
accustomed during the 1980s,'' the report says.
   Since World War II, more than 160 regional and civil wars _
defined as involving more than 1,000 deaths _ have been fought, the
530-page annual report says.

coproduction of the new fighter would take place.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger made it known
immediately before the vote that the administration regards the new

   For 21 years, Texan Vendyl Jones has been
using the Dead Sea Scrolls like a treasure map to search
surrounding desert caves for riches of the Jewish Temple buried by
the ancient Israelites.
   Among the lost artifacts Jones hopes to recover are the ``Ashes
of the Red Heifer.''
   These, according to the Old Testament (Numbers 19) were derived
from burning a rare, solid-red cow and using the ashes for
purification rites by the ancient Israelite priests.
   Many Orthodox Jews and Christian fundamentalists believe that
finding the ashes would be a step toward fulfilling the biblical
prophesy of rebuilding the Jewish temple on the Temple Mount,
currently the site of the Moslem holy shrines known as the Dome of
the Rock and Al Aqsa.
   ``The ashes are the future. This will allow the establishment of
the third temple,'' said Jones, 58, a former Southern Baptist
minister from Arlington, Tex.
   ``To me that's worth 10,000 King Tut tombs,'' he said, referring
to the spectacular ancient Egyptian treasure recovered in 1922 at
Luxor.
   Rabbi Menachem Burstein, one of a small number of rabbis trained
to use the ashes if they are recovered, said the ancient relics
would be used to purify Jews so they could enter the Temple Mount
without defiling it.
   ``If it's clear the ashes are authentic, it can help us prepare
for building the new temple,'' he said. ``For nearly 2,000 years
there haven't been any ashes.''
   However, any attempt to restore a Jewish temple on the site
would be certain to stir tensions throughout the Moslem world.
   The Romans destroyed the Second Israelite Temple in 70 A.D. A
religious ruling has banned Orthodox Jews from visiting the Temple
Mount so they would not walk on the site of the Holy of Holies
without being purified.
   According to the so-called Copper Scroll, the Ashes of the Red
Heifer were buried in the first century A.D. along with other
temple treasures by the mystical Essenes sect, who hid the Dead Sea
Scrolls in the same desert caves to avoid plundering by the
advancing Romans.
   The Copper Scroll is one of the Dead Sea Scrolls written by the
ancient Essenes and discovered in a cave in Qumran in 1952.
   Among the Temple treasures it says were buried with the Ashes of
the Red Heifer were gold, silver, the vestments of the high
priests, the balsam oil used to annoint the Israelite kings and the
original Israelite tabernacle built by Moses and Aaron.
   By carefully deciphering the document, etched in Hebrew on three
pieces of copper measuring nearly eight feet in length, Jones
believes he has been able to locate the cave where the Temple
treasures are buried.
   ``The scroll is filled with descriptions. It's like following a
treasure map,'' said Jones, who began his quest in 1968.
   ``The scroll says that on the way from Jericho to the biblical
town of Secacah, in the Wadi of the Dome, there lies ... a cave
with two openings separated by a large column,'' said Jones, who
studied Judaism at an ultra-Orthodox seminary in Jerusalem. ``It
says this is the cave where the treasures are buried.''
   But locating the cave among the thousands that dot Qumran was a
formidable task. Jones walked for miles guided by aerial
photographs before he finally found a dome-shaped hill rising above
a wadi, or dry riverbed.
   Several hundred meters (yards) to the east was a cave with two
mouths separated by a rock column.
   Jones and his son, Wain, began excavating the cave in 1977
despite arguments from archaeologists that previous digs showed it
was uninhabited. Within a few months 30 buckets full of pottery and
other artifacts were unearthed.
   ``When I started working on this cave, all the archaeologists
here thought it was a joke. They said the Bedouin had already
carted off anything that might have been here. I heard all their
ho-hums. I ignored them and I went on,'' Jones said.
   Subsequent excavations yielded tools and woven mats from the
Stone Age, pottery and a 4,000-year-old altar and the remains of a
first century clay stove and a basket of peanuts left by the
Essenes.
   The finds prompted Jones to set up the Arlington-based Institute
of Judaic-Christian Research which has funded excavation and sent
some 350 American volunteers since 1977. The expedition has the
backing of some prominent Orthodox Jews.
   Jones, who quotes Scripture as saying the ashes will be found by
non-Jews, says evidence found in the cave matches descriptions in
the scroll. These include a large white stone blackened by burning
lamp oil and a shaft of blue light caused by sunshine filtering
onto the cave's floor through a hole in its ceiling.

<HEAD>Kenny Rogers Says `Planet Texas' Has Great Possibilities</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor-singer Kenny Rogers believes he's found
a theme in the song about cowboys in space, ``Planet Texas,'' that
will become as fruitful as his song-turned-movie ``The Gambler.''
   His $600,000 video of ``Planet Texas,'' a high-tech Western,
will have its debut on his NBC special Saturday. The special was
taped at a concert with Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston. It's called ``Kenny, Dolly and
Willie: Something Inside So Strong.''
   The song, written by John Andrew Parks III, is also the lead
tune on Rogers' new album, ``Something Inside So Strong.'' The
video, which is loaded with special effects, was directed by Julien
Temple, who directed the current movie ``Earth Girls Are Easy.''
   ``The Gambler,'' an earlier Rogers hit song, was expanded into
three highly successful television movies.
   ``It's the most unique piece of music I've heard in 20 years,''
Rogers said of ``Planet Texas.'' ``It may be a new genre. It has to
do with space and time travel, but it's also a Western. These alien
cowboys pick me up and take me to a planet called Texas.
   ``We may do this as a movie for NBC, but we're also toying with
the idea of trying to attract a Steven Spielberg or George Lucas
and making it a feature film. It's such an unusual concept and
offers the same limitless possibilities that `The Gambler' did.
   ``It's easy to find projects,'' said Rogers. ``It's hard to find
projects that allow you do things that are unique and have no
comparisons. If I do any kind of acting my acting is questioned.
I'm not an actor. If I do something unique people get caught up in
it and are less apt to scrutinize my work.
   ``This is uncharted territory. There's nothing to compare it to.
My own philosophy has been that if you give us a little success
we'll make it a big deal. We did that with `Lucille' and we did it
with `The Gambler.' This can be a whole new career move.''
   He said ``Planet Texas'' was brought to his attention after
Parks was turned down for a record contract by Capitol Records.
   ``I was offered this terrific song and recorded it,'' he said.
``Then Capitol signed Parks to a contract. The only bad news is
that he has his own album coming out and I won't get his new songs.
This kid can sing. But it worked out good for him. He never could
have gotten a $600,000 video done.''
   Rogers had just flown to Los Angeles that morning from his
1,200-acre farm near Athens, Ga. He talked about the special before
going to NBC for an appearance on ``The Tonight Show.'' Afterward,
he planned to give a concert at a private party in Palm Desert,
then fly back to Georgia.
   He and his wife, Marianne, and his son, Christopher, 7, moved to
the farm two years ago. But, with his own private jet, he makes
regular jaunts for concerts, commercials, movies, charity
appearances and to look after his many investments. He's building
his own 18-hole golf course on the farm.
   ``I may sell the whole thing,'' he said. ``I'm basically a
builder. The fun is creating it, not living in it. I've overbuilt
every house I've had. It keeps me creatively busy.''
   Plans for Rogers' syndicated talk show have been pushed back to
1990. His manager, Ken Kragen, believes that by then, viewer and
advertiser rebellion against so-called ``trash'' television will
open up a market for late-afternoon shows.
   Rogers has also signed a new two-year contract to do commercials
for Dole, which also feature his wife and young son. Some of the
commercials were filmed on the island of Lanai, in Hawaii, which is
owned by Dole. Rogers is building a new home on the island.
   An older son, Kenny Rogers Jr., is also a singer and a host on
the ``Channel One'' program that is shown in schools.

<HEAD>The Liability Lottery _ Isn't Anybody Responsible?</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's the bizarre lawsuits that get the
attention _ the man who sued the subway for his injuries in a
suicide attempt, the woman who claimed damages from a bourbon-maker
saying the whiskey she drank caused birth defects, the bride-to-be
who collected from an amusement park for injuries suffered when her
fiance banged his bumper car into hers.
   But the impact of a costly and often capricious liability system
goes far deeper. Critics call it to a liability lottery. Business
leaders warn that it is a brake on the economy and it puts U.S.
firms at a disadvantage in world markets.
   The Committee for Economic Development, an organization of
business leaders and educators, says high insurance costs,
increasing legal fees and court judgments are only a fraction of
the real cost of the liability system. It argues the system
produces higher prices, keeps goods and services from the consumer
and discourages innovation.
   It seems almost everybody sues for almost anything these days.
   Business would like to see changes in the liability system, a
system that has moved gradually away from one in which the
plaintiff had to prove negligence or fault to recover. Now, some
argue, it is one of strict liability against product manufacturers,
doctors, accountants, lawyers, even clergymen.
   One objective of the system is supposed to be to deter injuries
by making the party responsible pay, sometimes heavily. The
advocates of change say that isn't working.
   They say imposing liability against defendants who have taken
reasonable precautions can undermine the incentive for all
manufacturers to be careful. If they're going to lose anyway, extra
care doesn't pay.
   The safest way out is to withdraw a product or service that has
been involved in a liability award. One manufacturer decided not to
market an asbestos substitute because of the risk of lawsuits. The
Conference Board, a business group, surveyed corporate chief
executives and found nearly half of their firms had dropped
products and nearly 40 percent had withheld new ones because of
liability risks.
   The CED is urging a uniform federal product liability standard,
to replace a system built around court decisions and widely varied
state laws.
   In a policy study it has just published, that group urged a
return to a system of liability ``based on some notion of fault or
responsibility for harm.'' It says punitive damages, which often
represent the big money in liability cases, should be limited and
ordered only in cases of willful misconduct.
   Businessmen seldom are fans of government regulation, but the
liability crisis has changed some attitudes. Compared with the
lawsuits of the past decade or so, the regulators are starting to
look good.
   As a result, strengthened and binding health and safety
regulation by the government is one of the cornerstones of the
drive for an overhaul of the liability process.
   Would-be reformers want more extensive regulation for health and
safety. The tradeoff proposed in the CED study would be to have
government regulatory approval supplant and preempt liability
lawsuits.
   That would apply only to design or labeling rules explicitly
approved by regulatory agencies. It wouldn't cover defective
products or cases in which a manufacturer broke the rules to get
regulatory approval.
   So far, efforts to replace the system with one of uniform
federal rules have run into the potent opposition of trial lawyers.
Consumer activists are wary of limits or restrictions on damages.
So change won't come easily.
   But the CED study argues persuasively that it's going to take
some kind of reform to create a more rational process.
   It cites the case of a drug for morning sickness, later alleged
to cause birth defects although there was no evidence of a link in
scientific studies. In 17 lawsuits, the manufacturer won 12, the
plaintiffs 5. A Massachusetts judge dismissed one case for lack of
evidence. A District of Columbia judge sent a similar case to a
jury, which awarded the plaintiff $20 million.

<TEXT>
   Graduation Day at the nation's schools and
campuses over the next few weeks will mark a rite of financial
passage for countless young people.
   Soon after the ceremonies are over, many graduates will get
their first taste of managing their own money full time as they
embark on their adult lives.
   It can be a big transition, but it needn't be a traumatic one.
The students of the 1980s, by all accounts, are much more
sophisticated about money matters than generations past.
   Furthermore, the occasion comes for most people at a stage of
life when they have energy and resiliency to spare, and plenty of
time to get some trial-and-error experience with money management
before they start making big commitments such as buying a home.
   Still, there are many pitfalls to be avoided. Suppose, for
instance, you plan to commute by car to a new job.
   It's important to take all the costs of that car into account _
monthly payments, insurance, and maintenance as well as gasoline _
if you want to make sure that most of your income doesn't get
consumed by the cost of getting to and from your job.
   A similar problem can arise with clothing. Many jobs naturally
require that you look your best, and the clothes you wore in school
may not measure up to that standard.
   But an all-out splurge on a new wardrobe can mean that you have
to work very hard just to pay for what you wear while you're
working.
   ``Try starting off gradually with skirts or slacks from your
current wardrobe and adding a basic suit and a jacket that will
coordinate with these,'' suggests the American Financial Services
Association, a trade group representing financial-services firms.
   Some other tips suggested by the AFSA:
   _ Like individual money managers of all ages, you will need to
handle credit cards and other borrowing with extreme care. Your
capacity for debt may already be stretched by student loans that
remain to be paid.
   But that doesn't mean that you should necessarily avoid all
credit offerings. One or two judiciously chosen credit cards may
help you establish a good credit history that might be useful later
on.
   ``Many college graduates are sent credit applications when they
graduate,'' observes Frances Smith of the AFSA.
   ``If you think you'll need access to credit early on, it may a
good idea to take advantage of one of these offers. Once you
relocate and get a new job, it may be more difficult initially for
you to obtain credit.''
   _ Learn to plan eating and entertainment expenses to get the
most benefit at a reasonable cost.
   Brown-bag lunches at work and dinner at home can save you a lot
of money that might otherwise be spent eating out all the time.
   ``Try to keep your refrigerator and shelves stocked so that you
won't be tempted to go out for meals too often,'' the AFSA advises.
   Another tried-and-true approach to keeping food bills down:
Always aim to shop with a list of the items you need (and
preferably not when you are famished from a long day of work and
exercise).
   According to the Howard Marlboro Group, a New York firm that
provides marketing information, fewer than one-third of supermarket
shoppers enter the store armed with a list.
   And more than half of the sales racked up by supermarkets
represent ``impulse'' sales _ unplanned purchases ranging heavily
to items like magazines, candy and gum, greeting cards and snacks.

   When crops fail or markets plummet, farmers
often tighten their belts and seek help refinancing loans. They
also rely a little more on paychecks from jobs in town.
   In three of the last 10 years, net cash income from farming has
shown year-to-year declines. But family earnings from outside jobs
have moved steadily higher each year.
   The Agriculture Department says 1989 will be no exception for
off-farm income. It will increase again, while cash income from
farming will decline for the third time since 1979.
   By themselves, the national statistics for the off-farm income
of farm families are indicative of how dependent U.S. agriculture
has become on outside earnings.
   For example, according to USDA historical figures and
projections for this year, off-farm earnings have exceeded annual
net cash income from farming in half of the years since 1979.
   This year could be a toss-up. Department economists project net
cash farm income _ the cash left over after paying cash expenses _
at $48 billion to $52 billion. That would be down from the record
of $58 billion in calendar 1988.
   Meanwhile, 1989 off-farm income is projected at $48 billion to
$51 billion, compared with a record $49 billion in 1988.
   Economists say the decline in net cash farm income will be due
mostly to larger expenses because of more cropland being brought
back into production and to a drop in federal payments.
   Off-farm jobs can be great insurance for farm families. But USDA
sociologists Timothy Parker and Leslie Whitener say that sometimes
there aren't any close at hand.
   ``Some farmers will have trouble finding off-farm work because
their individual characteristics make them weak competitors for
good jobs, or because the economic conditions of their local labor
market limit their employment and wage opportunities, or both,''
they said in a report.
   While the effects of the farm crunch of the 1980s has eased in
recent years, the long-term trends in farm consolidation and
technology point to continued declines in farm numbers and family
operators.
   The number of farms dropped to fewer than 2.2 million last year
from 5.9 million in 1945. According to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, an additional 300,000 farms will ``disappear'' by the
year 2000. Many of those families will seek other livelihoods.
   Parker and Whitener, writing in the current issue of RDP, a
rural development magazine published by the department's Economic
Research Service, said that ``as economic pressure continues, many
farmers will be forced to rely more heavily on non-farm earnings.''
   The 1982 census of agriculture showed that more than half of the
nation's farmers did some off-farm work that year and that
two-thirds of those who worked held jobs for 200 or more days.
   ``For some farmers, supplemental off-farm earnings make it
possible to have an adequate standard of living,'' the report said.
``For others, it keeps them from losing their farm.''
   Although the situation varies regionally across the nation,
Parker and Whitener said farmers as a group have a couple of
strikes against them when seeking outside incomes: age and
education.
   Using 1980 census figures, they found that 41 percent of the
nation's farmers were between the ages of 45 and 64, and another 23
percent were over 65. That left only 36 percent younger than 45.
   By contrast, more than 70 percent of the total U.S. labor force
was under 45 years of age.
   Education is another factor, the report said. Of farmers age 25
to 64 years, 67 percent completed high school, compared with 76
percent for the U.S. labor force.
   In another study, USDA economists Nora L. Brooks and Donn A.
Reimund found that off-farm income is a ``permanent, significant
component of total income for many farm households.''
   In 1986, they said, half of all farm households depended mainly
on off-farm income for family living expenses, while two-fifths
depended primarily on farm income. Less than a tenth depended on
both farm and off-farm income.
   ``Although previously considered by many observers and analysts
as a transitional step to full-time farming, off-farm employment is
becoming more widely viewed as a choice by farmers to pursue dual
careers,'' Brooks and Reimund said.
   On a strictly cash basis _ net cash income plus off-farm income
_ the average income of farm households ``has consistently been
higher than the average income of all U.S. households'' during the
1980s, Brooks and Reimund reported. But when certain non-cash
expenses are taken into account, mainly depreciation, the
comparisons are mixed.
   For example, after adjusting for depreciation and other factors,
the economists found that the annual household income of farmers
was 95 percent of the U.S. average in 1970 and 1971. However, from
1972 through 1976 _ the boom years when exports surged and
commodity prices were up _ annual household income of farmers
exceed the U.S. average.
   In 1977, the ratio dropped to 92 percent, rose back to 101
percent of the U.S. average in 1978, then fizzled for six straight
years, 1979 through 1984. The low mark was in 1981 when the average
income of farm families was only 76 percent of the national average.
   The ratio climbed to 101 percent in 1985 and to 111 percent in
1986, the most recent year tabulated in the research.

   If Pat Beaver has trouble at her motel in
this square-mile outpost along the Colorado River, the local police
department refuses to respond. She has to call nearby Indian tribal
authorities.
   When Luana Miller rousts a disorderly drunk from her Red Pony
Saloon down the street, she has to know the ancestry of the
scoundrel before she knows which police department to call.
   ``It's a pretty volatile situation in my business,'' she
grumbles.
   These days, nobody's sure who runs Parker _ the townspeople or
the neighboring Colorado River Indian Tribes. Two police
departments patrol the town. Some stores collect sales tax, some
don't. Some restaurants receive health inspections, some don't.
   The town of 2,800 is surrounded by the independent, sovereign
Indian reservation, and about one-third of the lots in town _
including Ms. Beaver's Kofa Inn _ are also on reservation land.
   In fact, a federal judge recently ruled at the behest of the
Indians that Parker was ``Indian Country,'' and part of the
reservation.
   Now the tribes, which share a 47 percent unemployment rate and
are eager for aggressive economic development, want a say in town
government.
   Townspeople are furious.
   ``People bought this land (in town) thought they were buying a
part of the United States, and they think they are part of the
United States. But that's what the judge ruled _ they aren't,''
said Parker Mayor Sam Davis.
   The clash of cultures has been anything but peaceful over the
years, and both sides say it has held back economic development.
   After Parker police fatally shot two Indians in separate 1987
incidents, tribal police began following the city officers, and the
city police chief described the situation as ``explosive.'' Federal
mediators helped defuse some of the tension.
   The reservation _ made up of Mohave, Chemehuevi, Navajo and Hopi
Indians _ launched a boycott of Davis' hardware store in Parker,
and in April the tribes bought some city land and opened their own
hardware store. It's nearly twice the size of Davis', and customers
_ Indian and non-Indian alike _ don't have to pay sales tax.
   The hardware-store land also went off the city tax roll and will
become reservation, tribal attorney William Lavell said.
   The Indians say they don't want to take over the town _ all they
want is more respect from townspeople.
   ``We realize we have to work with the town in order to have
peace in the community,'' said Lawanda Laffoon, one of three tribal
representatives on a negotiating team trying to resolve the dispute.
   ``We both realize neither one of us is going away.''
   But townspeople say the tribes are after their tax money, and
some say if the tribes take over government in Parker, many in the
town will pack up and move.
   ``It's conceivable but not practical,'' Ms. Miller said.
``People like me own two businesses and two houses in town. You
can't turn tail and run. My whole life is here.''
   The town has spent so much fighting the legal case that lawyers'
fees at one time amounted to 10 percent of the annual budget.
   While other areas along the Colorado River between California
and Arizona have boomed with tourism developments, Parker has been
left behind.
   ``I think that the dispute has hurt us all on both sides and we
would like to get out of that mode, so to speak, and get on to
development,'' said Roberta Hoffman, a town council member and
representative to the negotiating team.
   The 180,000-acre reservation that straddles the river was
established in 1865; the town was founded six years later outside
the reservation boundaries.
   Confusion about the lands took root in 1908 when Congress
approved moving the town onto reservation land so it would be near
the new railroad.
   A 1-square-mile area was carved up and sold by the government,
which holds reservation lands in trust. One-third of the land,
however, remained unsold and was returned to the tribes.
   The town and the tribe lived peacefully together for decades,
but trouble began amid a local economic depression caused by a 1983
flood.
   That year, the tribes filed suit asking that Indian authorities
be given jurisdiction over zoning on the one-third of the town that
was Indian land, and that the town be barred from denying utilities
to those Indian lots.
   Before long, the suit was seen as a threat to the town's
independence. The key question was whether Congress meant to
``dis-establish'' the town from the reservation.
   In February, the town lost. U.S. District Judge Roger Strand
ruled Congress didn't separate Parker, and the town was part of the
reservation.
   ``Whatever happened, it's over,'' Ms. Hoffman said. ``The
comment I am getting around town is let's sit down, talk and get
down to business. Let's get on with it, and let's get it settled.''
   ``I suppose we do have a choice (to continue fighting the
tribe),'' she said, ``but I don't think it's wise.''
   Two others from each side join Ms. Hoffman and Ms. Laffoon, who
are childhood friends, for discussions aimed at creating a series
of joint governmental agreements on everything from taxation to
policing to building codes.
   Law enforcement, for example, is so complicated that a slew of
police phone numbers have to be posted by the phone in Ms. Miller's
saloon.
   Town police can arrest only non-Indian town residents. Tribal
police can prosecute only misdemeanors committed by Indians.
Felonies by Indians become the domain of federal police, such as
the FBI or Bureau of Indian Affairs deputies.
   Now, if crimes are committed on Indian land within the town,
only tribal police respond.
   Some say the town is realizing that there are economic benefits
to be reaped by being part of an Indian reservation, which is
eligible for special tax breaks and extra federal funding. The
reservation is nearing completion of a new generating plant on the
Colorado which could offer low-cost electricity to new industry.
   ``We're going to save money in the long run,'' said town manager
George Kruse. ``Attitudes are changing. We're moving in the right
direction now. ... The lawsuit was the catalyst and the judge's
ruling was the reality.''
   But others, like Mayor Davis, said the only permanent solution
would have to come from Washington.
   ``Congress should finish doing what it didn't do in 1908. If it
didn't dis-establish the town, then it should do it now,'' he said.
   So much bitterness has built up that the town and the tribe will
never learn to get along, Davis said.
   ``It never will be resolved,'' the mayor said. ``You and I and
our kids won't live to see it resolved. ...
   ``I've seen a time here in town when they needed something and
we'd do it. We'd need something, and they'd do it.
   ``Now,'' Davis said, ``it's all screwed up where no one of us
can get along.''

<HEAD>Martin Short HBO Special Looks at Hollywood</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin Short insists that his HBO special
``I, Martin Short, Goes Hollywood'' is actually a salute to
Tinseltown, not a send-up.
   But perhaps that's fatuous entertainer Jackie Rogers Jr. talking.
   In the show, Short insists it is ``a celebration of Hollywood
done with style and class and proving once and for all that you can
do art in this town.''
   Oh, but that sounds so very much like something earnest Ed
Grimley would say.
   ``Hollywood is fun,'' said Short as himself, not as either of
his many alter egos. ``It's great fodder for satire, goodness
knows. People are obsessed with it. If someone had told me 10 years
ago there would be a nightly newscast devoted entirely to
entertainment, I wouldn't have believed it.
   ``The audience has become very sophisticated. My mother-in-law
will call from Toronto and tell me the box office grosses of my
latest picture. People in the Midwest will get the inside jokes in
this special.''
   The one-hour special premieres Saturday. Short is joined by
Christopher Guest and Tracey Ullman and Short's former SCTV
colleagues Joe Flaherty, Catherine O'Hara and Dave Thomas.
   ``When I do these shows, I put a lot of time and energy into
them,'' Short said. ``It's not a cakewalk. I have to find the time.
Like my work for `SCTV' and `Saturday Night Live,' I tend to
overwrite and strain the budget.
   ``I'd just finished a picture and was wrapping up my Saturday
morning animated series, `The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed
Grimley.' I'd work on the script for the special for a while, then
put it away. I'd kept a loose thread to it at all times.''
   In the special, Short plays song-and-dance man Dale O'Day,
struggling actor Lawrence Orbach, gossip columnist Tony Soren,
insufferable albino singer Jackie Rogers Jr., and, of course, the
tensely optimistic Ed Grimley.
   The skit as the gossip columnist was completely improvised with
Guest.
   Short said Jackie Rogers Jr., a character he developed on
``SCTV'' as one of the gushing guests on ``The Sammy Maudlin
Show,'' is a ``grotesque character who symbolizes everything that's
bad about show business. When he tries to be deep, he's merely
pompous. You want somebody to punch him in the head or throw a pie
in his face.''
   Ed Grimley was originated onstage at Second City. ``He's a
conglomeration of people I've known,'' Short said. ``Ed maintains
himself with a spirit of enthusiasm. He runs a gamut of emotions in
five minutes. He's like a guy smelling the roses after a heart
attack, except he hasn't had a heart attack.''
   Short, whose latest movie is ``Three Fugitives,'' has a film
development deal with Disney Studios.
   ``It's hard to find something that's good and something that you
haven't done,'' he said. ``I'm also looking at a Broadway musical.
The ideal career for me would be able to do a TV special, a movie
and a play every year. When I was an actor in Canada, you didn't do
just one medium. You did everything and it broadened you.''
   Short moved his home from Toronto to Los Angeles last year. ``I
always had a home here and a home in Toronto,'' he said. ``We've
got two children and two years ago we were flying back for
Christmas and the kids were screaming. I thought, why are we doing
this? For our value system. If you're not from L.A., it can be very
healthy to live elsewhere. This is the war zone and you go home to
rest. But the reality is I no longer felt it was necessary to go
home.''
   He's married to Nancy Dolman, who was Gilda Radner's understudy
when Short and Radner were doing ``Godspell.''
   Short was born in Hamilton, Ontario, where he said he grew up
watching Lucille Ball, Dick Van Dyke and Jackie Gleason.
   ``Those were the three big influences when I was young,'' he
said. ``I was fascinated by the way Gleason could play Ralph
Kramden and be so real. ... It always amazed me how far you could
go within the reality. A character without any reality is pretty
dull.''

<HEAD>Subaru Justy Automatic Still Has Plenty of Pep</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Finally, there's a little car with an automatic transmission
that's peppy yet doesn't struggle, even on tough inclines.
   This gutsy competitor, the 1989 Subaru Justy GL ECVT, is the
only car in the country with a newfangled, continuously variable
transmission that doesn't shift.
   Instead, the transmission's powerflow is smooth and continuous
and is designed to offer the fuel economy of a manual transmission
and the ease of operation of an automatic.
   The pricetag is under $8,000. That's noteworthy when you
consider that many major innovations usually show up first on
upscale luxury cars that most buyers can't afford.
   Subaru decided last year not to follow the pack and introduced
the Justy GL ECVT for the 1989 model year after years of research
and nearly two years of ECVT sales in Japan.
   The continuously variable transmission concept actually is about
100 years old, but Subaru combined the idea with computer controls
in its lightweight runabout, the Justy, and was the first to bring
such a transmission to America. Ford and Fiat have CVTs in Europe.
   Basically, the Justy's transmission operates through a pair of
pulleys and a metal belt that smoothly transfers power from one
pulley to another. The transmission automatically and constantly
adjusts its ratios to match engine revolutions and load to how fast
the car is going.
   There's no hunting for the appropriate gear in this car, even in
steep climbs.
   The transmission workings are in an oil bath for cooler
operation and longer life, Subaru says, adding that the ECVT has
fewer moving parts than conventional transmissions, so they're
easier to make and repair. The driver will notice none of these
things. All he or she has to do is put the gear lever in drive and
press on the accelerator.
   The Justy test car with its little, three-cylinder engine ran
smoothly as promised, save for one cold, 32-degree morning when I
felt one jerk as I tried to drive away from a cold start.
   The fuel economy was decent, too, about 34 miles per gallon in
rugged, pedal-to-the-metal, city-highway driving. That's the same
as the 34 mpg rating for city driving in a five-speed, manual
transmission Justy where you have to shift.
   As expected in a subcompact, the Justy test car offered easy
maneuverability in and out of parking spaces. But there's no power
steering, so it can take some effort to turn the wheels while at a
standstill.
   I also noticed a bit of torque steer when I pushed the
accelerator all the way down during a right turn. Seating is for
four and the nicely upholstered front seats felt fine. The rear
seat was stiff and benchlike, though, and there wasn't a lot of
headroom for tall folks.
   As expected in a subcompact, legroom could be tight if the front
seats were pushed all the way back. The interior was plain, with
screws showing where the speakers were placed at the end of each
side of the dashboard. Still, fit and finish was admirable and
there were no squeaks or creaks.
   The Justy had been a novel car from its start in 1987 _ it's the
only subcompact that has a four-wheel-drive version. For 1989,
Subaru added the two-wheel-drive GL ECVT version and put in more
passenger and luggage room to all Justy models by lengthening them
6 inches and adding another inch to the height. Larger tires and
front brakes on the GL and RS models were other changes for 1989.
   Americans seem to have taken to both the two- and
four-wheel-drive Justy models, with combined sales rising from
13,240 in calendar 1987 to 29,865 last year. For the first four
months of 1989, another 9,342 _ including 3,213 ECVT models _ were
sold, so the pace is about even with last year.
   Steve Davis, national manager of product relations at Subaru,
said the company's goal is for 3,000 ECVT sales per month. In
April, 1,044 were sold, he said, adding that good quantities of the
ECVT were not available at dealerships until after January.
   Davis said the Justy is especially popular with women. They are
59 percent of the buyers of the two-wheel-drive Justy and 51
percent of the buyers of the four-wheel-drive Justy. Buyers' median
age is between 31 and 34, and more than 72 percent have college
education, Davis said.
   Median household income ranges from $25,400 for buyers of the
two-wheel-drive Justy to $32,000 for buyers of the four-wheel-drive
version.
   A major competitor is the Ford Festiva, which looks similar to
the Justy on the outside and starts at about $7,000 for a two-door
hatchback with automatic transmission. Because the ECVT model is
new for this model year, Consumer Reports magazine does not have an
owner's trouble report.

   Lynne Sharon Schwartz has a ``lazy'' right eye.
With both eyes open, her vision is normal. But when she closes her
left eye, objects seem to break up, becoming a collection of
particles rather than a solid mass.
   In a recent interview at her Manhattan apartment, Schwartz, the
author of ``Rough Strife'' and ``Disturbances in the Field,''
motioned to a couch and explained that the eye enabled her to see
around it.
   She gives the same condition to the character Audrey, her alter
ego and the narrator of ``Leaving Brooklyn'' ($15.95, Houghton
Mifflin).
   ``It became a metaphor for seeing the reality behind the veil,
the surface,'' Schwartz said. ``It's wonderful for an adolescent.
The people around this girl are trying to present the world as safe
and happy and decent. She wants to know about all these ugly things
and everybody is trying to conceal them.''
   Author David Shields, like W. Somerset Maugham and John Updike,
is a stutterer. A native of California, he acquired a large
vocabulary by learning as many as synonyms as possible for words
that gave him difficulty.
   ``Dead Languages'' ($18.95, Knopf), his second novel, traces the
childhood of Jeremy Zorn, a stutterer growing up in Los Angeles and
San Francisco in the 1960s and '70s.
   ``Much of the burden of the book is trying to show how everyone
has their own stutter,'' Shields said. ``Whether they're the victim
of political sloganeering, or whether they fail to communicate
their essence or whether they hide behind academic jargon.''
   Schwartz and Shields are among the many writers who have used
their physical afflictions in a literary way.
   _ Rudyard Kipling suffered from failing eyesight, and made Dick
Heldar go blind in ``The Light That Failed.''
   _ The Southern author, Flannery O'Connor, contracted lupus, a
crippling disease that eventually killed her. Her short story,
``Good Country People,'' centers on a teen-age girl with an
artificial leg.
   _ Carson McCullers, also a Southern writer, was in ill health
most of her life, the victim of several strokes. ``The Ballad of
the Sad Cafe'' features the cross-eyed Miss Amelia and a hunchback
named Lymon Willis.
   _ Maugham transformed his stuttering to Philip Carey's club foot
in ``Of Human Bondage.''
   In the preface to a collection of Fyodor Dostoevsky's short
novels, Thomas Mann linked the Russian author's greatness to his
epileptic seizures.
   ``I am filled with awe,'' Mann wrote, ``with a profound, mystic,
silence-enjoining awe in the presence of genius of disease and the
disease of genius of the type of the afflicted and the possessed in
whom saint and criminal are one.''
   Mann cited the nihilistic Kirilov in ``The Possessed'' as an
extension of the feelings brought on to Dostoevsky by epilepsy. He
insisted that ``certain attainments of the soul are impossible
without disease.'' And he wrote of the ``incomparable sense of
rapture'' and ``inner enlightment'' that illness can cause, but
also of ``horrible depression'' and ``spiritual ruin.''
   Both Schwartz and Shields drew heavily on their own lives. Like
her character, Audrey, Schwartz grew up in Brooklyn in the 1940s
and used her eyesight to draw a contrast between her seemingly
uneventful life and the horrors of the Holocaust and atom bomb.
   ``You get the idea of things being in dots, that they're not
really together. This translates into the world being unsafe,
dangerous, which leads you to all sorts of modernist notions,'' she
said.
   ``Everything looks compact but actually the atoms are racing
around each other. Philosophically and emotionally, that's what
happens to this kid. Things are not as solid or coherent as they
seem.''
   Shields had articulate parents and remembered his frustration at
not being able to match their verbal skills. ``I felt like my
family was living in language while I was dying in it. That is the
key to the whole book. I, too, wanted to be sort of a verbal star.
I think what it did was drive me to the written word.''
   Audrey and Jeremy must each confront the pain of being
``flawed,'' damaged goods. Audrey's parents are horrified by their
daughter's eye, forcing her to wear contact lenses against her will.
   ``This idea of perfection was very important in Brooklyn,''
Schwartz said. ``Things should be right, they should be perfect.
They didn't care what was inside. You could have all sorts of moral
and emotional flaws, but they liked their children to look right,
the girls especially.''
   Jeremy's stuttering leads to humiliating attempts at acting and
debating and creates tension with his girlfriends and parents.
Shields writes of the twin impulses to be ``morally impeccable''
and ``squeaky clean.''
   ``It's never been just a little glitch in my tongue but an
entire stripe across my chest that seemed to be my signature of
being human,'' he said in an interview. ``Someone stuttering always
seemed to me to be saying life wasn't perfect and I especially
wasn't perfect.
   ``Things were flawed, there was a kind of tragic scratch across
everything.''
   Much of ``Dead Languages'' has a humorous tone, and the book
gave Shields the chance to express a healthier outlook on
stuttering than he was capable of in his own life.
   ``My own feelings about stuttering are relatively serious,'' he
said. ``It seems to me that the fun and joy of writing is you get
to reach a higher plane, some larger human realm. In the whole
scheme of things, stuttering is a minor thing. I think Jeremy
learns that, kind of.''
   While Audrey and Jeremy are each blessed with special insight,
their afflictions also create distance between themselves and other
people. Schwartz noted that Audrey's ``vision'' interferes with her
ability to connect emotionally.
   ``She was aloof from her life, her surroundings. She wants to
distance herself, almost look with condescension on the people
around her. I wanted to show the ruthlessness and lack of awareness
of a precocious adolescence,'' the author said.
   Audrey is able to ``see'' a better life than the world of
Brooklyn, and has little use for her parents' everyday existence of
card games and gossip. Schwartz attributed this to a lack of
insight.
   ``She sees these people as trite and silly, looks at them like
they're wasting their time. In Brooklyn, people also have lives and
passions and conflicts; they live. One life is as good as another.
It's her limitation she can't see that people of Brooklyn have
lives, too.''
   Jeremy's sense of irony, of detached amusement, is so strong
that even when his mother dies, he is left numb by the condolence
cards, admitting that he wanted ``to feel famous feelings but
couldn't get past difficulties in construction.''
   ``His real problem is that stuttering has driven him to a kind
of obsessive take on everything,'' Shields said. ``Much of the book
is a very delicate balance. You're suppose to hear underneath that
irony he's really in extreme pain.''
   Shields referred to Jeremy and stutterers in general as
``truth-tellers.''
   ``Everyone else hides their tension while stutterers manifest
it. Everyone is unsure of themselves but stutterers have the
`stupidity' to actually manifest it,'' he said. ``It makes me aware
of how people hide behind language and a lot of communication
contains lies.''

   On a whim one day, corn farmer Ed Dziuk
stuck an ear of popcorn in a microwave oven. What he saw amazed
him: The kernels burst into fluffy white flowers, still attached to
the cob.
   A food fad was born.
   ``Everyone on the planet Earth should experience this thing once
because it's exciting,'' says Ed's brother Al.
   When Ed and brother Dave showed him the microwave marvel, Al
says, he had no doubt it would sell. He was right.
   Microwave popcorn-on-the-cob is popping up in grocery stores,
gift shops and mail-order catalogs nationwide, an offbeat option to
the conventional varieties that consumers buy off the cob.
   A three-minute spin on a microwave carousel transforms a plain
yellow ear of the Dziuks' product into an ear of white, fluffy
popcorn. While some kernels pop on the cob, others fire off the ear
before puffing up.
   With all the gourmet and fancy popcorn now on the market, do
American consumers really need popcorn-on-the-cob?
   The Dziuks have no doubt.
   The popcorn producers boast that this farm-fresh corn grown in
West Texas has nothing artificial.
   ``It stays fresher on the cob and it's this year's corn,'' says
Dave, who oversees marketing with the help of Rip Hawk, a former
world tag-team pro wrestling champ who joined the brothers in their
venture.
   Who, they ask, could resist the fun of watching an ear of corn
twirl on the carousel, firing off kernels and turning itself into a
snack?
   Not everyone, however, was as quick as Hawk and the Dziuks to
catch onto the compelling points of popcorn on the cob.
   In the two years since they launched Texas Microwave
Popcorn-on-the-Cob, they have learned that selling a food fad isn't
easy.
   ``You can't just come up with a great new product and have
people grab it up,'' says Al.
   He and his brothers sold three acres' worth of popping corn in
1987, in packages of two or three ears and a plastic bag for
popping.
   But efforts to enlarge the operation stalled until the group
learned that getting on store shelves was next to impossible
without enlisting the help of a food broker, no matter how
ingenious the product.
   ``We really had to learn the food business, which we knew
nothing about,'' says Dave.
   In 1988 they planted 56 acres of popcorn-able corn, yielding
about 1.5 million ears, only to see thousands of ears sit unbought
in their warehouse. About 500,000 ears remain unpackaged, and an
equal amount was removed from the cob to sell as plain, pedestrian
popcorn, off the cob.
   The fledgling operation got a break when Hawk and the Dziuks
approached United Supermarkets Inc., a Lubbock-based grocery chain.
After seeing a demonstration of the product, buyer Max Tipton
called other employees out of their offices to watch the corn pop.
All agreed that their kids would be captivated by such a gimmick.
   ``We felt like people would enjoy watching it and that kids
would like it,'' Tipton says.
   After United helped line up a food broker, the ears of popcorn
began gaining wider distribution last fall.
   ``We went from zero to a pretty fair track record now,'' says
Hawk.
   Last fall, more than 19,000 packages of Texas Microwave
Popcorn-on-the-Cob were sold, and more than 20,000 have gone out
the door so far this year.
   Tipton says the company's packages, which sell for $1.79 at
United Stores, are selling at an average rate for popcorn.
   To prepare it for shipment, the hand-harvested ears must be
shucked and the ends trimmed with a radial saw before they're
enclosed in plastic bags, each of which holds 6-10 ounces of corn.
   Texas Microwave Popcorn-on-the-Cob now is distributed to 11
states, most in the Southwest and Midwest. In addition to grocery
stores and Michael's craft stores in 10 states, the product soon
may be sold in some J.C. Penney stores, Hawk says.
   The retail price ranges from $1.79 to $3 per package.
   With orders rolling in, the popcorn makers are gearing up to
package the remainder of their 1988 crop.
   They also are getting bulk orders from competitors elsewhere who
were left short of corn by last year's Midwest drought, Dave says.
A Nebraska company is packaging 10,000 ears of popcorn bought from
Texas Microwave, he says.
   The group figured its product would be largely a holiday item,
but found that demand picked up this spring.
   ``Popcorn is a year-'round thing nowadays,'' Dave says.
   Popcorn has become big business. Americans bought 807 million
pounds of unpopped popcorn last year, according to the
Chicago-based Popcorn Institute, and gobbled 12.9 billion quarts of
popped corn.
   The United States consumes two-thirds of the world's popcorn,
and Hawk and the Dziuks weren't alone in devising a corny new way
to pop it.
   Wesley Friesen of Venice, Fla., introduced Corny Bros. Popcorn
on the Cob. It comes three ears to a package and sells for $3.95.
Other companies sell their on-cob corn as a novelty item, packaged
in old-fashioned mason jars.
   With success popping, the idea man of the Dziuk operation, Al,
is planning more ingenious ways to offer popcorn-on-the-cob. He's
experimenting with colored corn in hues from blue to purple to red.
   ``We don't want to become millionaires,'' Al says. ``But we do
think we have something here.''

   The crush of higher interest rates forced new
housing construction down for the third straight month in April,
the government reported in yet another sign that the economic
slowdown is hitting home.
   Residential construction starts dropped 2.7 percent last month
from March's rate to their lowest level in more than six years as
an upturn in the building of single-family homes was overshadowed
by a big drop in new work on apartments, the Commerce Department
reported Tuesday.

order blocking South Africa-controlled Minorco S.A. from acquiring
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC.
   Minorco Chief Executive Sir Michael Edwardes said Tuesday his

Michael Mukasey maintained an injunction barring Minorco from
buying more Gold Fields shares.
   Luxembourg-based Minorco is the world's largest gold producer in

   While simple comparisons of the absentee rates of men and women,
for example, would show women miss work slightly more than men, a
variety of other variables make such information useless to an

<HEAD>Troubles In W. Germany And Japan Might Be Helping Dollar's Rise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Political instability in Japan and West Germany
may help account for the weakness of their currencies and the
relative strength of the dollar, some economists believe.
   The dollar rose Monday to its highest level against the West
German mark since the end of 1986 and its highest level against the
Japanese yen since November 1987. It edged back on Tuesday.
   Market sentiment is the main cause of the dollar's rise, and if
psychology changes, the currency could drop as quickly as it shot
up.
   Some analysts say the dollar's rise has little to do with
politics. ``If the dollar was falling, people would come up with a
reason why that was happening,'' said Shafiqul Islam, senior fellow
for finance at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
   But the more common view is that political factors are giving
the dollar an artificial and probably temporary boost, an opinion
held by David Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago.
   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and his Liberal
Democratic Party have been crippled by a spreading influence-buying
scandal.
   Takeshita remains in office in spite of single-digit approval
ratings because attempts to find a successor have been
unsuccessful. The ruling party is trying to gain public support in
time for elections in July for the upper house of the parliament.
   Meanwhile, in West Germany, the Christian Democratic Union of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been trailing the opposition Social
Democrats since the first of the year in nationwide polls.
   Kohl shuffled his Cabinet last month in a step that the Social
Democrats derided as ``Kohl's last stand.'' Some observers believe
Kohl could lose office if the allied Free Democrats pull out of the
ruling coalition.
   ``Investors in stocks and bonds in a foreign currency tend to
require a risk premium when there's a situation unfolding that's
unsettling and raises question about economic policy,'' said
William Sterling, manager of international economics for Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co.
   There are other reasons for the dollar's rise, including
relatively high interest rates in the United States that make
dollar-denominated investments more attracive.
   Currency traders typically follow the dictum that ``the trend is
your friend,'' and as long as the dollar seems to be on an upward
trend, dealers figure they can make more money by buying it than by
selling it.
   Ordinarily the Bank of Japan would raise Japanese interest rates
to pull the yen out of its slide. But the central bank is reluctant
to do that because it could hurt the price of bonds and stocks,
particularly shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. that
have already lost about half of their value.
   Unlike the rigorously independent Federal Reserve, Japan's
central bank is tied to the Ministry of Finance, which is in charge
of floating NTT shares and moreover has been sullied in the
influence-peddling scandal.
   The situation in West Germany is somewhat different, since the
central bank is independent and freely raises rates when necessary
to stem inflation. In fact, base rates have been raised three times
since last fall.
   But the political instability in West Germany could be driving
investors to change their marks into dollars and invest them in the
United States, said Mieczyslaw Karczmar, a New York-based adviser
to Deutsche Bank of West Germany.
   ``The issue of a stable political climate and safety is terribly
important,'' Karczmar said. ``Capital for obvious reasons seeks
safety and stability.''
   The United States has a huge trade deficit, but for now
investors are choosing to ignore it, focusing instead on issues
such as attractive U.S. interest rates and the nation's political
stability.
   Aside from politics, many traders believe that Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III and other U.S. officials do not mind a
rise in the dollar now, in spite of public commitments to stabilize
its value.

<HEAD>Fortune's 500 Non-Industrial Companies Post 55 Percent Profit Rise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The nation's top 500 service companies provided
the ``all-purpose sweating'' for an industrial boom and posted
aggregate profits of $73.8 billion last year, a Fortune magazine
survey says.
   Fortune's survey of non-industrial companies said a sharp
resurgence in commercial banking also helped lift profits at the
nation's largest service companies by 55 percent over 1987.
   By contrast, the annual Fortune 500 survey of leading industrial
companies released last month showed a 27 percent rise in profits
to $115 billion among those companies.
   The report, released Tuesday for publication in the magazine's
upcoming June 5 issue, marked a rebound for service companies from
the year before, when the stock market crash and earnings problems
among unstable savings institutions contributed to a 22 percent
drop to $50.8 billion in the Service 500's profits.
   Fortune said the resurgence in the service sector was tied to
the nation's industrial boom, which required service company help
for shipping, sales ``and the all-purpose sweating to make it
work.''
   Fortune's 34th annual Service 500 survey indicated that a
turnaround by the nation's 100 largest commercial banks accounted
for most of the gain. The banks reported $17.5 billion in profits
in 1988, compared with a $5.3 billion loss the year before.
   Transportation companies, diversified services, savings
institutions and retailers on the list also showed strong gains.
   The only decline was posted by the nation's utilities, whose
profits fell 5 percent to $21.6 billion. Fortune attributed the
drop to nuclear power plant problems at several companies,
including Long Island Lighting Co., which registered more than $1
billion in losses partly because of its idle Shoreham nuclear plant.
   The top 50 transportation companies showed an aggregate 50
percent profit increase, to $5.48 billion, as airlines pulled in
higher fares and railroads hauled high tonnage to keep pace with
factories' production and export needs, Fortune stated.
   Retailers, the only bright spot in 1987 with a 16 percent profit
hike, registered a 10 percent gain last year, to $9.12 billion.
   Fortune said service industry exports exceeded imports by $7.8
billion in 1988, with a total of $70 billion in service exports
last year.
   The companies in the service survey, like Fortune 500 industrial
corporations, were ranked by sales.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. became the biggest
diversified services company with $35.2 billion in sales,
displacing Super Valu Stores, a wholesale food distributor. AT&amp;T
moved to the Service 500 from the Fortune 500 in 1988 because it
brought in more money from providing telephone service than from
manufacturing products like computers and telecommunications
equipment.
   Behind AT&amp;T were Fleming Cos., a wholesale foods distributor;
Super Valu and McKesson Corp., which is involved in wine and
spirits, chemicals, drugs and health care distribution and services.
   Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp. and BankAmerica Corp. remained
the top three commercial banking companies.
   The top diversified financial companies held their places.
American Express Co. was largest, followed by Federal National
Mortgage Association, Salomon Inc., Aetna Life and Casualty and
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Among savings institutions, H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. was first,
followed by Great Western Financial Corp. and Calfed Inc. Last
year's leader, Financial Corp. of America, dropped from the list
after Robert Bass acquired the company's troubled American Savings
subsidiary.
   Top retailers were Sears Roebuck and Co. and K mart, followed by
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which jumped from fifth the previous year.
   United Parcel Service swapped places with UAL, parent of United
Airlines, as the top transportation company, followed by AMR,
parent of American Airlines, CSX Corp. and Texas Air Corp., the
parent of Eastern and Continental Airlines, which fell from third
place in 1987.
   GTE Corp., Bellsouth Corp. and Nynex Corp. remained the biggest
three utilities respectively, followed by Bell Atlantic Corp. and
fast-growing US West Inc., which rose from ninth place.

   Minorco SA's attempt to create the world's
largest gold producer through a hostile takeover of Consolidated
Gold Fields PLC finally unraveled after months of wrangling before
U.S. judges and British market officials.
   A federal judge in Manhattan refused on Tuesday to lift his
order blocking South Africa-controlled Minorco from acquiring Gold
Fields before a $5.9 billion takeover bid was to expire.
   ``That Minorco has only until tomorrow to appeal this decision
is regrettable,'' wrote U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey, who
first imposed the injunction last October on antitrust grounds.
   After Mukasey refused to stay his order pending appeal, Minorco
Chief Executive Sir Michael Edwardes said the Luxembourg-based
company, the largest gold producer in the noncommunist world, would
allow the Wednesday deadline to lapse.
   Rudolph Agnew, chief executive of Gold Fields, the
second-largest gold producer, said he was ``highly delighted'' with
the result of the battle, calling it ``a tremendous victory.''
   Last fall, Minorco, which is largely controlled by two South
African corporations _ Anglo American Corp. of South Africa and De
Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. _ launched a hostile takeover bid for
Gold Fields. Minorco already held almost 30 percent of Gold Fields'
shares.
   Gold Fields and its U.S. subsidiary, Newmont Mining Corp., the
largest gold producer in the United States, sued in New York to
block the takeover.
   Mukasey halted the takeover bid, saying the combined entities
would control 32.3 percent of the non-communist world's gold market.
   On Tuesday, the judge said Minorco had ample time to appeal his
earlier rulings but ``for its own reasons and aware of the
onrushing dealine, Minorco chose not to do so.
   ``It should not now complain of unfair prejudice because it
chose voluntarily a strategy which now leaves little time to
appeal,'' he wrote.
   Minorco owns or has tenders for about 55 percent of Gold Fields'
shares, but Mukasey's injunction bars Minorco from buying shares it
doesn't own. The company said it would keep its position ``under
close review.''
   Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers ordered Gold Fields to
drop out of the U.S. lawsuit unless it obtained shareholder
approval. Gold Fields voluntarily dropped out a week ago, leaving
Newmont as the only obstacle to the takeover. Gold Fields owns 49
percent of Newmont.
   Unless Minorco could get Newmont to withdraw its lawsuit, the
bid was to expire Wednesday under British regulations.
   In its last attempt to have the injunction lifted, Minorco
claimed Newmont lacked standing to continue the suit because it
told the British takeovers panel it was a U.S. concern not
controlled by Gold Fields.
   Minorco lawyers claimed that if Newmont was not controlled by
Gold Fields, it could not allege antitrust injury.
   Newmont originally claimed that because its U.S. operations were
more efficient than Minorco's South African mines, Minorco
eventually would shut down U.S. operations if the takeover were
accomplished.
   In upholding Mukasey's earlier rulings, a federal appeals court
said last month that ``Newmont's threatened injury is precisely the
type that the antitrust laws were designed to protect against.''
   Mukasey wrote that the premise of Minorco's argument was
incorrect.
   ``Newmont ... could suffer antitrust injury in the form of
reduced control over pricing and output as an independent
competitor if the takeover succeeded and Minorco controlled a
greater share of the world non-communist gold market,'' he wrote.
   He added that ``Newmont has standing as an independent
competitor to allege that the resulting combination of Gold Fields
and Minorco would substantially lessen competition and injure it.''

   Martin Sorrell, the WPP Group PLC boss who is
closing in on his second record advertising buyout in three years,
makes the assembly of a world-class advertising and marketing
services empire look easy.
   The Ogilvy Group Inc. gave in late Monday to WPP's $864 million
takeover bid less than three weeks after Sorrell first proposed a
buyout to a company whose leaders admit they preferred independence.
   It appears he may have learned some valuable lessons since his
much rockier pursuit of another American advertising giant, JWT
Group Inc., for what was then a record price of $566 million in
1987.
   In getting the Ogilvy board to agree to the buyout quickly,
securities analysts say Sorrell may have avoided offending clients
who tend to get upset if they feel their ad agency's top management
is preoccupied with a messy takeover fight rather than minding the
client's business.
   And he may have scored points with Ogilvy employees by saying he
intended to keep Ogilvy and its management intact and wanted to
have them run Ogilvy autonomously from the former JWT Group's J.
Walter Thompson agency.
   Ogilvy founder David Ogilvy, reported to be vehemently opposed
to Sorrell's overtures initially, was offered and accepted the post
of chairman of WPP. Ogilvy Chairman Kenneth Roman stays on in that
post.
   In addition, Sorrell said he was leaving to Ogilvy and the
managers of its Scali, McCabe, Sloves Group agency the resolution
of whether the employees will be allowed to buy Scali McCabe.
   A little more than a year ago, six top executives of the Lord
Geller Federico Einstein agency that was part of JWT Group walked
out, leaving a still unresolved legal tangle after Sorrell refused
to let them buy the agency.
   ``This will not be another Lord Geller,'' Roman told reporters
on Tuesday, referring to the Scali McCabe matter.
   Ogilvy's board backed WPP's plan to launch a tender offer of $54
a share for all of Ogilvy's stock.
   The agreement, reached late Monday gives WPP another famous
advertising brand name with a list of blue chip clients like
American Express Co., American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Sears,
Roebuck and Co.
   The purchase will elevate WPP, which placed third among the
world's advertising and marketing services companies in 1988, to
second place with $13.5 billion in billings, a shade behind
industry leader Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC, where Sorrell once worked.
   Nonetheless, Sorrell said quality rather than quantity has been
his objective in building WPP.
   At a news conference and in remarks to Ogilvy shareholders on
Tuesday, Ogilvy's Roman said he had investigated every reasonable
alternative but could not find anything to beat WPP's all-cash
buyout offer.
   He said management considered ``everything from white knights to
white squires to recapitalization to leveraged buyouts.'' He
declined to identify an potential suitors.
   Roman said he was confident there would be few if any client
defections in the wake of the buyout agreement.
   Some analysts have said WPP's acquisition of Ogilvy could prompt
some advertisers to take their business elsewhere. Thompson works
for Eastman Kodak Co., for instance, while Ogilvy works for rival
Polaroid Corp.
   Sorrell had proposed a friendly buyout at $45 a share in late
April, sweetened the proposal to $50 a share early last week and
boosted it to $54 a share this past weekend.
   Ogilvy stock closed at $32 a share the day before WPP's initial
proposal was disclosed. Ogilvy closed at $53.12{ a share Tuesday,
down 12{ cents from Monday's close.
   Burt Manning, who heads J. Walter Thompson, said he welcomed
Ogilvy's addition to WPP and said the buyout ``improves WPP's
chances for competing in the marketplace.''
   He said Thompson would nonetheless compete fiercely with
Ogilvy's main agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, for clients.

<HEAD>CNW Management Hopes To Join Buyout Bidding</HEAD>

   Japonica Partners says it is confident it
received substantial support from CNW shareholders in a proxy
contest, but the results won't be known for at least a week.
   Meanwhile, CNW's chairman said Tuesday that the railroad
company's management hoped to assemble a buyout bid to top
Japonica's $722 million offer.
   CNW Chairman Robert Schmiege announced managment's plans at the
company's annual meeting while Japonica, a New York-based investor
group, began a $44-a-share hostile tender offer for CNW's common
stock.
   At the meeting, shareholders were asked to vote to either retain
CNW's seven directors or replace them with a slate of Japonica
nominees.
   Japonica said it was confident its slate won substantial
shareholder support, but the group was disturbed by what it called
CNW's ``contradictory actions.''
   Japonica said CNW purported to be seeking competing bids for the
company while at the same time trying to persuade public officials
to intervene on behalf of the company.
   Schmiege denied that he or other company officials had pressed
federal or state officials to step into the battle between his
company and Japonica.
   Schmiege dropped his bombshell near the end of the annual
meeting when asked by a shareholder to explain management's role in
CNW's ongoing search for prospective buyers.
   ``The management group has been in active discussions _
discussions that were interrupted only to come over to this meeting
_ with an equity partner, with banks, with a subordinated debt
player and with an outside player, all of whom's cooperation and
participation is necessary for us to make a bid,'' Schmiege said.
   ``We are reasonably optimistic that we will succeed in this
effort and will be in a position to make a competing bid,'' he told
the approximately 300 shareholders attending the meeting.
   At a news conference later, Schmiege said he hoped to announce a
management bid within a week. He declined to identify any of the
parties participating in the discussions.
   CNW's stock closed Tuesday at $43.87{, up 12{ cents on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Japonica spokesman C. Howard Hardesty, who would become CNW's
chairman if his group succeeds, said Japonica would welcome any
competing bids but that he hopes CNW's board would set a deadline
for offers.
   In a speech to shareholders, Hardesty said Japonica intends to
sell CNW's real estate, excess equipment and Chicago-area commuter
lines to partially recoup buyout costs, but it is committed to
running CNW's core railroad freight business.
   ``This is an operating group, not a buy-and-sell group,'' said
Hardesty, a former president and chief executive of Purolater
Courier Corp.
   In another development, the Interstate Commerce Commission told
Congress Tuesday that it would continue to examine the possibility
of asserting jurisdiction over any non-railroad takeover of CNW.
But the ICC said any attempt to assert jurisdiction over such a
buyout would ``result in litigation in which the commission's
chances of success are questionable.''
   CNW is the parent of the Chicago and Northwestern Transportation
Co., a 6,000-mile railroad with 8,500 employees that operates in
nine states, most of them in the Midwest.
   CNW also operates Western Railroad Properties, a coal-hauling
franchise in Wyoming's Powder River Basin that Schmiege called
``the most profitable 200 miles of railroad in the country.''
   Japonica has identified the coal-hauling business as one of the
assets that attracted it to CNW.

   The temptation to share inside information about a
corporate takeover apparently proved too much for a 24-year-old
paralegal at a prestigious law firm, the Securities and Exchange
Commission says.
   In a civil complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in
Boston, the SEC charged that Kerry A. Hurton handled confidential
papers about plans for a $230 million buyout of a southern
department store chain while she was working in the Boston office
of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom in 1987.
   By passing information about the takeover to friends and
acquaintances, the SEC said, Ms. Hurton prompted at least five
people to buy a total of 65,020 shares of stock in the Birmingham,
Ala., chain of Parisian Inc. at an average price of $18 a share in
June and July 1987.
   When a buyout by Hooker Corp. was announced later that summer,
Parisian's stock shot up to more than $30 a share, the SEC said.
   The complaint seeks to force the defendants to return alleged
profits of $823,825 and pay up to three times that amount in
penalties. Lawyers for the defendants said they maintain they did
nothing wrong.
   Attorney John Wall, who represents Ms. Hurton, said she has
agreed to sign a consent decree in which she does not acknowledge
any past wrongdoing but agrees to refrain from passing inside
information in the future.
   ``I had asked the SEC to file the consent decree simultaneously
with the complaint,'' Wall said. ``But apparently they want the
publicity to be one-sided.''
   The SEC said Ms. Hurton worked for Skadden, Arps, a leading New
York law firm, from October 1986 to July 1988. During that time,
the firm represented Hooker, an Australian retailing and real
estate company.
   Peter P. Mullen, an executive partner in the 970-lawyer firm,
said Skadden, Arps cooperated with the SEC probe and suspended Ms.
Hurton in May 1988 ``as soon as we learned she was under serious
suspicion.'' He added that she was fired a few weeks later ``when
she refused to cooperate'' with the SEC investigation.
   ``From our point of view, we feel aggrieved, because in effect
she appropriated information she shouldn't have and flagrantly
violated our policies _ if in fact the charges are correct,'' he
said.
   Hooker completed the acquisition of Parisian for $30.65 a share,
or a total of about $230 million, in April 1988. Mullen said he did
not believe the insider trading had any effect on the deal.
Parisian has 16 stores in Alabama, Texas, Georgia and Florida.
   The SEC's year-long investigation was sparked by a tip from ``a
private individual'' said John Sturc, the agency's associate
director for enforcement in Washington.
   In its complaint, the SEC said Ms. Hurton passed the information
to a ``close personal friend,'' Eric Laboz of New York City, and
his former roommate at Boston University, Jonathan R. Beck of North
Hills, N.Y.
   In addition, Ms. Hurton allegedly gave the information to two
real estate investors, Bruce E. Maurice of Danvers and Sheldon M.
Stone of Marblehead, who in July 1987 gave her an $8,500 loan
secured by a second mortgage on a condominium unit sold to her by
Maurice, the SEC said.
   ``There was an initial price agreed on, and subsequently the
financing terms were changed in a way to make it easier for her to
buy the apartment,'' Sturc said. ``You have to draw your own
implications'' about whether the loan was a payoff for the
information, he added.
   Stephen Delinsky, attorney for Maurice and Stone, said they are
``sophisticated investors'' who chose Parisian stock without any
inside information.
   ``There is nothing wrong with buying stock and making money on
it, and there isn't a shred of evidence they did anything more than
that,'' Delinsky said.
   The SEC complaint charges that Sheldon Stone gave the stock tip
to his brother, Bernard Stone of Norwell, Mass., a supervisory
deputy U.S. marshal in Boston. Bernard Stone then advised five
people to buy the stock, but they have not been charged with
knowingly trading on inside information, the SEC said.
   Phone calls to Ms. Hurton's home in Boston were not returned
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Rose Blumkin Wants Back Into Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than a week after Rose Blumkin announced
she quit Nebraska Furniture Mart in a spat with her grandsons, the
95-year-old Russian immigrant wants a piece of the business she
founded 52 years ago.
   ``I would buy it in a minute,'' Blumkin said of the carpet
department of the Furniture Mart, the nation's largest furniture
store at a single location with 300,000 square feet of retail space.
   ``I would pay him a high price,'' she said referring to Omaha
investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought 90
percent of the store in 1983. ``Five million, $8 million, whatever
it takes,'' she said.
   Otherwise, Mrs. Blumkin said she'd be willing to manage the
carpet department for Buffett _ without any direction from each of
the two grandsons she has been know to refer to as ``Hitler.''
   Buffett paid $55 million for his stake in Furniture Mart, but
Mrs. Blumkin retained the title of chairwoman and remained a
fixture on the sales floor, selling carpeting and furniture from
atop her motorized golf cart.
   If Buffett hired her as carpet manager, she vowed to reimburse
him for any losses.
   Either as an owner or manager, Mrs. Blumkin said she wants ``to
show how a business should run . . . That's my point.''
   Mrs. Blumkin, popularly known as ``Mrs. B,'' hasn't talked to
Buffett since she walked out of the store May 3. She announced last
week she quit the business because her authority as carpet
department head had been undermined and she couldn't work with her
two grandsons.
   The two are Ronald, 40, Furniture Mart president and chief
executive, and Irvin, 37, vice president. They are the sons of
Louie Blumkin, 69, vice chairman.
   Because of the way the deal with Buffett was structured, Louie
Blumkin's family has increased its ownership to 20 percent with
Berkshire Hathaway retaining 80 percent. If Mrs. Blumkin can't talk
Buffett into agreeing to either of those plans, she said she might
set up a new wholesale carpet business and run it out of a vacant
warehouse she owns directly north of the Furniture Mart.
   Such a company, which would sell mainly to small furniture
stores and apartment house owners as well as to consumers, would
put her in competition with her former store, she admitted.
   The goal isn't to make money, Mrs. Blumkin said. She would pay
sales people commissions and share profits with them while donating
additional profits to charity.
   Mrs. Blumkin, who typically put in 60- to 70-hour weeks on the
job, said she doesn't know what to do with herself without work.
   The Furniture Mart's sales of furniture, carpets and appliances
reached $152.5 million last year.

<HEAD>Tourism Head Wants Geneva To Liven Up</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CYRIL TUOHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diplomats and other negotiators from all over the
world constantly fill up Geneva's hotels and restaurants, but
ordinary tourists apparently find the place dull.
   Tourism in Geneva has been falling since 1984 and Olivier Vodoz,
head of the Geneva tourist office, believes it's time to liven
things up.
   ``Geneva must provide non-stop cultural, artistic, and athletic
events,'' he said. ``We have to organize large concerts, both
classical and rock, which will attract young people.''
   He thinks the city of 160,000 permanent residents suffers from
its staid image.
   ``Seventy percent of the people who are considered tourists are
either businessmen, representatives to international organizations,
or delegates attending conferences,'' he said. ``The other 30
percent are people simply passing through.''
   With 270 restaurants _ many of them catering to the
expense-account crowd _ a tourist office pamphlet describes Geneva
as ``one of the world's gastronomic capitals.'' But most prices are
out of reach for the backpack crowd. Geneva also has 39 discos and
night clubs but many require membership.
   Vodoz noted that chronic traffic congestion dissuades motorist
travelers from stopping in Geneva, which has one of the world's
highest automobile densities. In order to allviate that problem,
the city is increasing its number of parking places.
   High hotel prices _ $225 a night for a single at a plush
lakeside hotel _ also are listed as contributing to the decline in
tourist business in continental Europe's second most expensive
city, trailing Copenhagen, Denmark.
   ``With the help of the hoteliers we have made efforts to try to
reduce prices but we can still do more,'' Vodoz said.
   Some relief is expected from the recent weakening of the Swiss
franc against the dollar and other major currencies, and tourist
officials hope the forecasts of higher crude oil prices will mean a
return of free-spending Arabs.
   But while it attempts to attract more tourists, Geneva will
definitely not change its cityscape, Vodoz said.
   ``As a result the city may appear less exciting or dynamic than
other cities. We will never become a Hong Kong or a Monaco.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was stronger in early European
trading today ahead of this morning's scheduled release of U.S.
trade figures for March. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said trading was calm with most market
participants waiting for the trade figures to push the dollar up or
down.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose for the fifth consecutive trading day,
closing up 0.70 yen at 137.70 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted
at 137.60 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.9448 West German marks, up from 1.9426; 1.7405
Swiss francs, up from 1.7360; 6.5825 French francs, up from 6.5685;
2.1911 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1820; 1,416.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,408.75; 1.1907 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1892.
   In London, one pound cost $1.6353 compared with $1.6398 late
Tuesday.
   Gold prices hovered in a narrow range and bullion dealers said
the market continues to lack enough volume to push prices one way
or another.
   Gold opened in London at $373.75 a troy ounce, compared with
late Tuesday's $374.25. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $373.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $373.95 compared with $374.40 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.25 to close at $374.74.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.51 a troy ounce, down from
Tuesday's $5.55.

   In one sense, this small native fishing
village was spared. Although the tanker Exxon Valdez hemorrhaged
more than 10 million gallons of crude just 5 miles from their cove,
local folks have seen little of the oil in their waters.
   In another sense, they're not so fortunate. ``It's probably
still going to get us,'' says village president Gary Kompkoff.
   ``Right now most of us would be out collecting salmon spawn,''
he said. ``But that has been canceled. We're not sure if we're
going to be able to fish at all this year. Ninety-eight percent of
the annual income of the village is fishing.''
   Tatitlek, settled in the late 1800s on the northern shore of
Prince William Sound, has 95 residents. All but 10 are Aleut
Indians, and many are Russian Orthodox, typical of this part of
Alaska.
   Tatitlek fishermen have caught salmon in Prince William Sound
for decades, but since the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef
on March 24, the familiar cycle of village life has been disrupted.
   ``Right now we're just trying to understand what this will mean
for us long term,'' said Kompkoff.
   The lucrative herring season has already been canceled.
   In the nearby fishing town of Cordova, loss of the herring catch
will cost $12 million. But Cordova fisherman are making up some of
the loss with income from working booms for Exxon, gathering
remnants of the spill in their boats.
   Few of Tatitlek's fishermen have been offered such work.
   Says Kompkoff, ``We've gone from fear to anger to apprehension
over this thing. It's going to be with us for a long time to come.''

<HEAD>Clothing Retailer Plans New Stores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 48-store Nordstrom chain is shedding its
regional focus as it seeks to establish new ``beachheads'' on the
East Coast and in the Midwest, according to the co-chairman of the
Seattle-based clothing retailer.
   At the department store company's annual meeting Tuesday, Bruce
Nordstrom said the chain will continue to expand. Nordstrom entered
the East Coast market for the first time last year with a store in
McLean, Va.
   The company plans to build 14 new stores totaling more than 2.5
million square feet of space over the next five years. Most of the
stores will be 200,000 square feet or larger, compared to an
average 110,000 square feet for existing stores.
   Among them will be the company's first in the Midwest. Nordstrom
plans a Minnesota outlet in the giant Mall of America, a
5-million-square-foot shopping mall and amusement park under
construction in Bloomington.
   At least six more stores are on the drawing boards for the
Northeast and the company plans five new California stores in
smaller markets, such as Santa Barbara.
   ``I guess we are going to continue to build stores as long as
they continue to do as well as they are doing,'' Nordstrom said.
``The sky's the limit.''
   The company ended 1988 with record sales of more than $2.3
billion and record profits of $123 million.
   Profit in Nordstrom's fiscal first quarter grew to nearly $23
million compared to $19.2 million in the same period in 1988.
   Nordstrom stores averaged sales of $380 per square foot last
year.
   ``We would guess that has got to be at the very top end of the
industry,'' Nordstrom said.
   John Nordstrom, who with his brother James and cousin Bruce
co-chair the company, said after the meeting that developers are
offering to pay the company to locate as anchor stores in planned
malls.
   ``I think it's fair to say that when you go into Minnesota and
Indiana, we got an awful good deal,'' he said, because those
markets aren't particularly hot. Nordstrom plans to open an
Indianapolis store in 1993.
   The expansion program will cost more than $500 million over the
next five years, but John Nordstrom said the company does not want
to use too much debt to finance it. Its debt-to-equity ratio was 43
percent in January, and Nordstrom said the company wants to keep
that ratio below 50 percent.
   The company issued $150 million in long-term debt last year, and
sold $1.3 million in stock to gain equity financing.
   John Nordstrom said he did not think the company would seek
additional equity or debt financing this year, preferring to fund
expansion with retained earnings.
   But additional funds could come from stock sales in the future.
Shareholders Tuesday approved a measure that would allow the
company to issue 250 million shares of stock, up from 100 million.
The provision would allow for additional stock dividends, stock
splits, acquisitions and other purposes.

<HEAD>Continental Drops Higher Fares _ After Competitors Balk At Fare Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines canceled a planned increase
in its summer discount fares after several competitors refused to
follow suit with their own fare hikes.
   ``We can't afford to be non-competitive in our prices,'' John
Nelson, Continental's executive vice president for marketing, said
Tuesday in announcing that the carrier would not increase fares.
   Nelson said Continental decided to back off the fare hikes
because most of the other carriers weren't imposing increases.
   Last month, the Houston-based airline owned by Texas Air Corp.
announced that its popular Max Saver tickets bought after May 26
would increase by as much as $80.
   Continental's decision to raise summer fares was expected to
kick off similar increases at other airlines. But most carriers
didn't match Continental's plan.
   Trans World Airlines and United Airlines said Monday they would
not raise summer fares. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and
USAir rejected the move earlier this month. Braniff, which said
earlier it would match Continental's rates in cities where they
compete, also is reconsidering.
   Air fares typically increase during the summer with demand, and
major airlines usually match each other's fare increases almost
immediately.

<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shareholder proposal to dissolve
Upjohn Co.'s ``poison pill'' takeover defense was withdrawn and the
company is not for sale, its chairman says.
   Theodore Cooper on Tuesday turned aside rumors that Upjohn was
up for sale based on recent heavy activity in the company's stock.
   ``I'm not an auctioneer,'' Cooper told shareholders at Upjohn's
annual meeting. ``The company is not for sale.''
   Upjohn's stock climbed 62{ cents a share on trading of 1.3
million shares Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange to close at
$32.75. There have been rumors that a European competitor has its
eye on the company.
   Two months ago, the company strengthened its takeover defense,
which allows shareholders to buy stock at half-price if any one
stockholder acquires 20 percent of the company's 185 million
outstanding shares.
   The California State Teachers Retirement System, which holds a
block of Upjohn shares, had proposed that the so-called ``poison
pill'' defense be dropped. But Cooper said the proposal was dropped
before the annual meeting after a count of proxy votes showed that
it would fail.
   Two other resolutions were defeated at the meeting. One would
have required the company to cut all ties with South Africa and the
other would have kept proxy voting confidential from company
officials.
   Also at the meeting, Upjohn President Lawrence C. Hoff said
company sales, which last year amounted to $2.2 billion, would
continue to grow if any of four pending federal applications were
approved.
   Two applications before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
would allow use of its Xanax central nervous system medication for
panic and depression. Also pending are applications for approval of
two new products, the antibiotic Zefazone and the antidepressant
Deracyn.

   Oil was dumped early Wednesday into a dry
fountain in front of the Exxon Building in New York City's
Rockefeller Center.
   ``It was a very small amount, and we're cleaning it up,'' said
center spokesman Vince Silvestri. He said the puddle appeared to
have been motor oil and that the center had no information about
its origin.
   A caller identifying himself only as an Alaskan told The
Associated Press at 5 a.m. that he and a fellow Alaskan had dumped
50 gallons of oil in the Exxon fountain.
   They did it so that Exxon executives ``might feel a little
closer to the story'' of the oil spill in Alaska, he said, and ``to
protest that it's taking a long time to clean up.''
   The spill from the Exxon-owned oil tanker Exxon Valdez occurred
on March 24 off the coast of Valdez, Alaska.
   Silvestri said he had no estimate of how much oil was dumped
into the fountain, but said it was ``extremely considerably less
than 50 gallons.''
   The fountain has been undergoing repair and had no water in it.

<HEAD>Record Exports Push Down Trade Deficit in March</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $8.86
billion in March as a record level of export sales helped to offset
rising oil imports, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the improvement in the country's
trade balance came from a 7.4 percent rise in exports, which hit a
record $30.78 billion. Imports were up as well, climbing by 3
percent to $39.64 billion.
   The March deficit represented a 9.9 percent improvement from a
revised February imbalance of $9.82 billion. The March deficit was
the lowest since January, when the deficit fell to $8.68 billion.
   For the first three months of the year, the deficit has been
running at an annual rate of $109.4 billion, an improvement from
last year's deficit of $119.76 billion.
   The size of the March trade improvement was a surprise to many
economists. Analysts continued to insist, however, that the
country's trade performance will show little, if any, improvement
for the whole year as U.S. exports fall victim to recent increases
in the value of the dollar, which make American products more
expensive on overseas markets.
   ``The deficit for this year will be about the same as last
year,'' predicted Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting
firm. ``I think the March number was artifically low.''
   Such an outcome would represent a blow to the Bush
administration, which is counting on continued trade improvement
this year to fuel overall economic growth.
   Last year's dramatic 21 percent drop in the trade deficit from
an all-time high of $152.1 billion in 1987 accounted for almost
half of all U.S. economic growth.
   The administration hailed the March trade report. Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher noted that the deficit for the first
three months of this year was 10 percent lower than the imbalance
in the final quarter of 1988.
   ``These numbers support our contention that a favorable movement
in our exports and imports is under way,'' Mosbacher said in a
statement.
   The trade improvement last year came from a sharp jump in export
sales. The administration is hoping to push exports even higher in
1989 by threatening to retaliate against countries that keep their
markets closed to U.S. products.
   The March improvement came despite the fact that the bill for
foreign oil climbed to $3.69 billion, up 13.6 percent from the
February level, reflecting higher prices.
   The total oil bill was the highest since November 1987. The
$15.97 per barrel price represented the fourth consecutive monthly
increase.
   But U.S. exports fared exceptionally well during the month with
across-the-board increases in most categories. The $30.78 billion
in total sales topped the previous record of $29.06 billion set
last December.
   The strength in exports helped to give the United States a rare
trade surplus of $0.4 billion with Western Europe, the best showing
since March 1983. The deficit with Canada, the largest U.S. trading
partner, fell to $0.2 billion, the smallest imbalance in more than
seven years.
   As usual, the biggest deficit was recorded with Japan, a $4.2
billion imbalance, down from a $4.7 billion gap in February. Other
large deficits were recorded with Taiwan, $0.8 billion; South
Korea, $0.4 billion, and Brazil, $0.3 billion.
   One primary reason that economists believe the overall trade
trend will be negative this year is the recent run-up in the value
of the dollar, which makes U.S. exports more expensive and imports
cheaper for American consumers.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc., forecast
that the trade deficit for all of 1989 should total $118 billion,
essentially unchanged from 1988. Last year, the deficit fell by
21.3 percent to $119.7 billion after hitting an all-time high of
$152.1 billion in 1987.
   ``We are looking for virtual stagnation in the trade balance
this year,'' Ms. Latta said, citing in part the fact that the
dollar has been rising in recent weeks.
   On Monday, the dollar hit its highest point against the West
German mark since the end of 1986 and its highest point against the
Japanese yen since November 1987 despite the fact that the United
States and other governments have been selling greenbacks on the
open market in an effort to brake the rise.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch, said changes
in the dollar's value over the next several months were likely to
reflect what happens to U.S. interest rates.
   ``As long as U.S. interest rates stay up, the dollar will remain
fairly strong,'' he predicted. ``Once interest rates start to come
down as the Fed reacts to the weakening economy, then the dollar
will likely start declining as well.''
   Since a stronger dollar makes American goods more expensive on
overseas markets and makes imports cheaper for American consumers,
any rise in the dollar is viewed with alarm by economists who
believe the U.S. currency needs to fall further for America to have
a chance to narrow the trade deficit to a more sustainable level.
   It also presents problems as the new Bush administration tries
to resist growing protectionist pressures in Congress. The
administration is facing a congressionally imposed deadline of May
30 to issue a report targeting countries which have erected major
barriers to sales of American products.
   If the barriers are not removed during an 18-month negotiating
period, then the trade act passed last year gives the
administration the authority to retaliate by erecting barriers
against that country's imports into the United States.

<HEAD>Protests Against Fax Bill Lead Governor To Sign Law</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 14-15, `Maryland State ...' to CORRECT to Genn, sted
Glenn.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five days after his fax machine was
deluged with messages urging him to veto a bill banning unsolicited
facsimile messages, an annoyed Gov. William A. O'Neill signed the
measure into law.
   A similar campaign in Maryland may lead that state's governor to
do the same, an aide said.
   At least eight states have considered such measures. Proponents
complain that such messages tie up fax machines for a minute a page
and use up expensive special paper. The machines often are left
hooked to telephone lines 24 hours a day.
   O'Neill on Tuesday lashed out at the California-based
organization that generated the unsolicited messages, tying up the
machine while his office was awaiting word on flood conditions from
the state Office of Emergency Management.
   ``I had been following discussion about the legislation, but
frankly, last week was the first time the need for this kind of
legislation was brought home to me,'' he said in a message issued
with the announcement of the signing.
   The new law allows people receiving unsolicited facsimile
machine messages to seek up to $200 in damages.
   The National Fax Users Committee, based in Mission Viejo,
Calif., had told the governor in its messages that it could cost
the average company $6,000 a year in telephone bills to seek
permission to send fax messages.
   Maryland Gov. William Donald Scaefer's office received 343 fax
messages Thursday after the National Fax Users Committee faxed
hundreds of one-page protest fliers to Maryland businesses to relay
to the him.
   ``If we had any important messages coming in we wouldn't have
been able to get them through,'' said David S. Iannucci, the
governor's lobbyist.
   Businesses were urged to sign a protest message on the flier,
tear the message off and fax it to the Statehouse. About one fifth
of the businesses receiving the message sent it on to the governor,
Ianucci said.
   Iannucci called the one-day campaign ``incredibly
counterproductive,'' saying it might help persuade Schaefer to sign
the bill.
   One executive sent his flier with an added message, asking
Schaefer to sign the bill into law and stop people ``from using my
fax machine as their printing press.''
   The Maryland bill would impose a fine of up to $1,000 on anyone
attempting to fax messages to sell goods, services or real estate
unless the receiver gave prior permission or a previous business
relationship existed between sender and receiver.
   Maryland State Del. Gilbert J. Genn, one of the bill's sponsors,
said opposition comes from direct-mail and electronic marketing
firms which frequently are armed with fax telephone number lists
and automatic dialing machines.
   ``You can almost imagine the havoc that this could wreak,'' Genn
said.
   A similar bill was junked earlier this year by the Washington
Legislature.
   One of the sponsors of that legislation, Washington state Rep.
Ken Jacobsen, said of the issue: ``This is the ultimate in abusive
use of a private communication system. You get a message you didn't
want from people you don't know on paper they didn't buy.''

   The stock market showed a modest gain today on a
better-than-expected report on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .36 to 2,453.881 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 581 up, 375 down and
524 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 30.59 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit narrowed to $8.86 billion in March from a
downward-revised $9.82 billion the month before.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street had called for a March deficit
of $10 billion or more.
   The news sent the dollar higher in foreign exchange. But
analysts said it got a less exuberant response in the bond and
stock markets, in part because it suggested that the pace of the
domestic economy might not be slowing as much as had been hoped.
   In addition, brokers said traders were staying cautious ahead of
the scheduled report from the government Thursday on the consumer
price index for April.
   There is some concern on Wall Street that the figures will cast
some doubts on the belief that the Federal Reserve is beginning to
succeed in its effort to restrain inflation.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up \ at
52; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up [ at 34{; McDonald's, up [
at 57~, and Eastman Kodak, up ] at 43].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.21 to 176.13. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .47 at 350.39.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.44 points to
2,453.45.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed issues, with 791 down, 677 up and
500 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 173.10 million shares, down from 179.35
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. on Wednesday
reported flat second-quarter earnings in spite of a 15 percent
increase in revenue.
   Net earnings totaled $203 million, or 86 cents a share, in the
period ended April 30, compared with net earnings of $202 million,
or 82 cents a share, in the second quarter of last year. Net
revenue reached $2.86 billion, compared with $2.50 billion in the
year-ago period.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, the maker of
computers and scientific instruments said its earnings rose 4
percent to $396 million, or $1.69 a share, from $381 million, or
$1.53 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 18 percent to $5.52
billion from $4.69 billion.
   Hewlett-Packard warned on Monday that second-quarter earnings
would be lower than expected.
   The company predicted in Monday's announcement that net earnings
would be 85 cents to 90 cents per share while the average Wall
Street estimate had been $1. That announcement caused a sharp drop
in its stock.
   ``We experienced strong orders for most product lines throughout
the second quarter, yet our net revenues and profits did not meet
expectations,'' said John Young, president and chief executive
officer.

   Char de Vazquez once walked away from a
successful Mexican export business she created from a single animal
skin, but she didn't leave behind the flair for design that has
landed her creations in some of the finest stores from New York to
California.
   Today, her Char Designs Inc. manufactures leather and suede
clothes in New Mexico, home of the ``Southwest'' look glorified by
designer Ralph Lauren.
   Char Design items _ ranging from $33 hand-painted scarves to
$1,800 suede and velvet fox-trimmed opera jackets _ have been a
fashion standard for the last decade. All of the skirts, blouses,
jackets and other items created by de Vazquez and her staff of four
designers are made with lamb skin imported from New Zealand and
dyed in Britain. Many are hand-painted with detailed designs.
   They are found in Saks Fifth Avenue, Bonwit Teller, Lord &amp;
Taylor and Neiman Marcus. Notables from Sam Shepard and Robert
Redford to Johnny Cash and Ronald Reagan have been seen wearing the
buttery-soft shirts and jackets. Musician Joni Mitchell, ``Dallas''
star Linda Gray, and newswoman Maria Shriver also are past
customers.
   Overall, de Vazquez estimates that 100 retailers nationwide,
including her retail outlets in New Mexico and her boutique in Palm
Desert, Calif., carry Char Designs collections.
   The 44-year-old Santa Fe designer recalls ordinary circumstances
marked her business beginnings in Guadalajara, Mexico, where she
moved with the Mexican chef who became her husband shortly
thereafter. At first, he was working and she was not.
   She likens the story to a fairy tale.
   ``It was like the miller's daughter, you throw straw at her and
she's supposed to spin it into gold. I was left alone in this house
with some leather. So I made a handbag and painted it,'' says de
Vazquez, who had been a clothing designer in Sausalito, Calif. ``A
young couple from New York City saw it and asked me to do a
collection.''
   In the fall of 1968, the couple took the small line of handbags
to a boutique show in New York.
   ``Every single big department store in New York saw it. We were
nationally known in three to six months _ an overnight explosion,''
de Vazquez says.
   Within a year, the Mexican business, joined by her husband, was
shipping $25,000 in merchandise a month, and Hollywood provided a
major chunk of the clientele, she says.
   ``People would come down in vans and just stock up,'' she says.
   By 1976, de Vazquez says, ``we had 150 employees, and an entire
town that hand-painted all the leather for us.''
   But while business boomed, the marriage faltered.
   De Vazquez and her two small boys packed up and moved to Santa
Fe, a place she thought would be good for starting over.
   She says the Mexican business ceased within a year after her
departure. But with the help of her retired parents and her sister
Sherry Stein _ a San Francisco fashion designer who moved to Santa
Fe about that time _ it wasn't long before she was back on track.
   With their father helping finance the startup operation, the
sisters began Char and Sher Designs. They had their established
contacts, but decided on a strategy that was the reverse of what
made the earlier Mexican business succeed.
   ``I knew the formula,'' de Vazquez says. ``But we decided that
rather than making a lot of cheap stuff, we would make real
expensive stuff and not much of it and get the same dollar.''
   During the first several years, the family, with the help of a
friend who had worked for de Vazquez in Mexico, worked to establish
a regional market for the designs.
   The turning point came in 1979 when the August issue of
Gentlemen's Quarterly magazine carried a Char and Sher cowboy shirt
on its cover model. Before long, the company was at the forefront
of the Southwestern clothing flurry of the early 1980s.
   ``That exploded our entire business and we started selling to
every single major department store,'' de Vazquez says.
   Stein has since left to study design at Pasadena, Calif., Art
College and de Vazquez is running the business' complex 15 miles
north of Santa Fe in the village of Cuyamungue.
   She and her team of designers work out of studios on the
property, and sewers and cutters work among the reels of soft,
multi-colored lamb skin in an adjacent plant. Her parents, Adelene
and Lynn Blankenship, live in a home just behind her ``Viva''
wholesale outlet, but they and Stein no longer have financial
interests in the venture.
   The peak for the business came in 1984, when it grossed more
than $2 million, de Vazquez says, while recent annual revenues have
been in excess of $1 million.
   De Vazquez says 1982 _ the year the western market ``fell off a
cliff'' _ was the most difficult.
   ``There were millions of prairie skirts and all of a sudden
nobody wanted them,'' de Vazquez says. ``Accounts went broke. But
being small and innovative, we turned on a dime.''
   That meant giving way to variation in design, and, for a time,
veering away from the Southwest style to more conservative or
high-fashion looks.
   For now, thanks to the renewed popularity of Ralph Lauren's
westernwear, and the ever-increasing trendiness of Santa Fe itself,
leather skirts, coats and blouses seem to be in high demand.
   Still, de Vazquez says she is prepared for the death of the
trend.
   ``It won't make any difference any more,'' de Vazquez says.
``We've already entered into high fashion. If it calls for
Southwest we plug it in. If it doesn't, we don't.''

<HEAD>British Airways Confident New Boeing Jets Will Be Approved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said Wednesday
there is ``nothing basically wrong'' with Boeing's new 747-400
series jets but that the American company has not met modern
European standards.
   ``There is nothing basically wrong with the aircraft,'' said a
CAA spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   ``But you can liken the situation to that of a motorist who,
some years ago would not have needed rear seat belts, but who now
does.''
   The U.S. regulatory body, the Federal Aviation Administration,
has approved the new aircraft, but European aviation authorities
are threatening to withhold airworthiness certificates for the
planes unless Boeing agrees to a number of design changes.
   Without the certificates the planes cannot be used for scheduled
commercial flights.
   British Airways, which has ordered 19 of the new planes, said
Wednesday it remains confident it will soon be operating them.
Eight of the planes are scheduled to be delivered to the airline
this year, the first next month.
   ``We are confident the issue will be resolved and that we will
take delivery of the aircraft and introduce them into service as
planned,'' said a spokesman for British Airways, also speaking
anonymously.
   European aviation authorities want changes made in the design of
floor beams supporting the planes' upper decks, and better
separation of certain electrical circuits.
   ``Boeing has not given enough attention to the way standards
have been developed,'' said the CAA spokesman. ``We are telling
them there are more modern standards to be taken into
consideration.''
   The first of the 747-400s to be introduced into Europe is
scheduled to be delivered Thursday to the Dutch airline KLM.

<HEAD>EEC Plans ``Social Charter'' to Guarantee Workers' Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EEC Commission said Wednesday it
had agreed on the outline of a plan for a ``social charter'' which
would guarantee the rights of workers throughout the 12-nation
trade bloc.
   The charter would spell out the obligations of member states to
guarantee the free movement of workers between the 12 European
Economic Community countries. It would also ensure the workers'
social security protection, working conditions and education
programs.
   Vasso Papandreou, the EEC's commissioner for social affairs and
employment, said the Commission wanted to guarantee that everybody
benefited from the EEC's plans to dismantle all trade and other
barriers by the end of 1992.
   ``Europe can be built neither against the wishes of companies,
nor against the wishes of workers or citizens. It needs the full
participation of all social groups,'' she said.
   Ms. Papandreou said she expected a clear mandate for such a
charter to be given to the commission by the EEC summit meeting in
Paris at the end of this year.
   ``There will be a solemn declaration by the heads of government
and state and a clear mandate to the commission to come up with an
action program by June 1990 at the latest,'' she said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade as predictions of rain
continue to drag down prices.
   The drop in prices is due to government and private forecasts of
above-average rainfall in parts of Iowa, Minnesota and other
western crop states affected recently by dry weather, said Rich
Feltes, an analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   The strong dollar is creating anemic demand in Europe for U.S.
soybean products. That and increasing exports of Brazilian soybeans
is putting pressure on soybean futures.
   Traders also are noting that the drag on corn and wheat prices
is being caused by the failure of the Soviet Union to order
additional grain through the U.S. export bonus program.
   In early trading, wheat was a \ cent lower to } cent higher,
with the contract for delivery in May at $4.10 a bushel; corn was a
{ cent to 1\ cents lower with May at $2.77 a bushel; oats were 3
cents to 4 cents lower with July at $1.86 a bushel; soybeans were
1{ cents to 3} cents lower with May at $7.28{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .23 cent lower with June at 71.35
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .13 cent higher
with May at 77.25 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .37 cent
lower with June at 47.80 cents a pound; pork bellies were .47 cent
lower to .23 cent higher with May at 33.30 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled mixed Tuesday, while pork futures were

   Suitors who have made proposals to buy
strikebound Eastern Airlines have been told to ``put up or shut
up'' and put at least $100 million in cash on the table.
   David I. Shapiro, the bankruptcy examiner for Eastern, said
Tuesday there are no ``real live offers'' to buy the carrier.
   In response, one of the two groups bidding for Eastern said late
Tuesday it planned to revise its proposal with a new plan that will
include ``substantial equity capital.''
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, meanwhile, said Eastern
has provided valid reasons for its plan to sell its prized
Northeast shuttle service. Eastern already has an agreement to sell
the shuttle to developer Donald Trump for $365 million, but Lifland
gave the airline until Monday to consider a higher bid by America
West Airlines.
   Joel Zweibel, the attorney representing Eastern's major
creditors, said they support a prompt sale of the New
York-Washington-Boston service.
   At an all-day bankruptcy hearing, Shapiro said there are no
``real live offers out there yet'' for all of Eastern. Two investor
groups have submitted buyout proposals to the court for the whole
airline including the shuttle.
   ``This is not bankruptcy as usual; this is an important case
involving the interests of the public,'' Shapiro told a packed,
humid courtroom. ``It's time to put up or shut up.''
   He asked the interested suitors to put at least $100 million of
their own cash at risk. The two buyout proposals depend heavily on
debt financing, according to sources close to the situation.
   Miami-based Eastern has been under Chapter 11 protection from
creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a paralyzing
strike by its Machinists union that was supported by pilots and
flight attendants. The bankruptcy court must approve any sale of
Eastern or any of its assets, including the shuttle service.
   Two investor groups, one headed by Chicago commodities trader
Joseph Ritchie and the other by former Piedmont Airlines chairman
William Howard, have submitted formal bids.
   Shapiro said the two groups have told him their proposals are
``opening shots'' in an eventual negotiating process rather than
final offers.
   The pilots union released a statement late Tuesday from the
Ritchie group saying it plans to submit a revised offer that would
address Shapiro's ``concerns over the need for substantial equity
capital.'' The statement noted the plan would be the first to
propose putting substantial equity capital _ as opposed to borrowed
funds _ at risk in an Eastern buyout.
   Lewis Kaden, an attorney representing the Howard group, told
reporters outside the courtroom that his group would also consider
buying the shuttle alone at a price below that offered by America
West but higher than Trump's.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes told the court that the shuttle
could easily be detached from the rest of the airline's operations.
Part of the $300 million net profit expected to be gained from the
sale to Trump will go to repay debts and rebuild other Eastern
operations, he said.
   Eastern has proposed a plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and
sell some $1.8 billion in assets separately, including the shuttle.
   As part of the plan, Eastern announced in Miami Tuesday an
agreement to sell 15 aircraft to UAS-Invest, an aircraft leasing
company, for $277.5 million. The airline has announced several
similar deals in recent weeks.
   Phoenix-based America West has offered to pay $415 million for
the shuttle and $336 million for 10 Boeing 757s in a total package
worth $751 million.
   Trump's $365 million agreement with Frank Lorenzo, chairman of
Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., expires on May 27. Under their
contract, the developer would receive $8 million from Eastern if
the shuttle deal collapses.
   Lifland said Eastern had articulated a ``good, sound business
reason'' to sell the shuttle, although he has not yet decided
whether such a sale would be in the airline's best interests. He
postponed the next hearing on Eastern until Monday to give the
airline time to evaluate the offers.
   Lifland denied a request by a group of New York financial
institutions for more time to submit a bid for Eastern because it
couldn't meet last Wednesday's deadline. Shapiro called the group's
bid ``frivolous.''
   The consortium had said it would offer around $1 billion for
Eastern, but only if the deal also included assets that Lorenzo
sold to other airlines after he acquired Eastern in early 1986.

   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit narrowed to $8.86 billion in March from a
downward-revised $9.82 billion the month before.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street had called for a March deficit
of $10 billion or more.
   The news sent the dollar higher in foreign exchange. But
analysts said it got a less exuberant response in the bond and
stock markets, in part because it suggested that the pace of the
domestic economy might not be slowing as much as had been hoped.
   In addition, brokers said traders were staying cautious ahead of
the scheduled report from the government Thursday on the consumer
price index for April.
   There is some concern on Wall Street that the figures will cast
some doubts on the belief that the Federal Reserve is beginning to
succeed in its effort to restrain inflation.

Tuesday it was reevaluating its hostile $20-a-share takeover bid
for the company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.22 to 176.14. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .70 at 350.62.

   Karen O'Connor, vice president of AEMMP Record
Co., hypes the company's latest release in the best tradition of
music promoters.
   ``I really haven't heard anything in a long time that was
powerful as this music,'' she says. ``It's a lot better than what
I've been hearing on the radio lately.''
   O'Connor is pushing a record, but if she pushes a bit too hard,
perhaps she's entitled. The record by the Bad Examples will be
AEMMP's sole release this year and the executive is only 20 years
old.
   AEMMP _ pronounced ``amp'' _ is a real record company owned by
Columbia College, a private liberal-arts school in downtown Chicago
with an enrollment of about 6,500.
   AEMMP also is a class. Company executives and workers are
students learning to operate what singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell
once called ``the starmaker machinery behind the popular songs.''
   For O'Connor, who quit two part-time jobs and spent her spring
break in Chicago to devote more time to this year's project, the
class could become a springboard to a job with a major record
company and advance her toward the goal of managing a big-name
rocker.
   ``This class is going to give us great resumes,'' she said.
   The objective of the class, called ``Decision-Making: Music
Business,'' is to find a musical act, sign it to a contract,
manufacture and market its record and get the band signed to a
major record company.
   So success for O'Connor and her approximately 20 classmates also
would give a boost to the Bad Examples, a pop-rock quartet selected
by the class from among about 200 acts as the brightest star on
Chicago's club scene.
   ``The more different people that are excited about the music and
working for it, the better it helps us,'' said Ralph Covert, the
group's songwriter and lead singer.
   AEMMP released the three-song set by the Bad Examples on April
26 in two formats _ 800 12-inch vinyl records and 200 cassette
tapes. The record-release party at a Chicago-area nightspot marked
the completion of the production phase of the project and the
beginning of the marketing push, which includes pestering radio
stations into playing the music.
   ``If you're going pop, you can't exist without airplay,'' said
Chuck Suber, a co-creator of the class. ``You can't even get into a
record store without something that's been pre-sold on the air.''
   O'Connor said AEMMP would pitch the Bad Examples release to all
national record companies. But she said it was at least as
important to promote the band via airplay, club appearances,
perhaps even a concert tour of college towns.
   ``If we start a buzz in Chicago, they're going to be that much
more interested in the product,'' she said.
   The AEMMP Records class was founded in 1982 by Suber, who had
just stepped down after 24 years as publisher of down beat
magazine, a jazz monthly, and Irwin Steinberg, who had just retired
as chairman of New York-based Polygram Records Inc.
   Suber also had taught part-time for many years in Columbia's
Arts, Entertainment and Media Management Program, for which the
in-house record company is named, although the department is now
called simply the Management Department.
   Suber and Steinberg still teach the academic portions of the
two-semester class. Debra Hale, a graduate student who served as
president of the 1984 AEMMP class, oversees the record company's
progress.
   Steinberg sees the class as a chance for students to do
``something real rather than a mock effort.
   ``They've got to put themselves on the line and go to market
with the artist and experience either the success or defeat,'' he
said in a telephone interview from New York. ``It's more than
theoretical _ it's real.''
   AEMMP's greatest success to date was in 1987, when its release
of a 12-inch single by an urban-dance trio called ATM led to the
group's being signed to a three-year deal with Omni Records, a
Philadelphia label distributed by the Atlantic Recording Corp.
   The group's first Omni release, a 12-inch single titled ``Try
Me,'' got some airplay on the East Coast last summer and a
follow-up is due out this summer, said ATM's leader, Ardie Rowe.
   Suber said ATM's contract with Omni calls for AEMMP to receive 2
percent of the revenues from the group's first two releases after
Omni has recouped the advance it paid the artists. But ATM's first
release didn't sell enough copies to bring any money back to the
college, he said.
   Since the only area of record-company management not covered is
studio recording, the class begins its star search with a call for
production-quality tapes.
   After the students select an act, AEMMP contracts with a record
maker to press the vinyl copies, a tape duplicator to make the
cassettes and an album-jacket company to package the product.
   With only a $1,500 budget, the students often rely on the good
will of manufacturers like AGI Inc., a suburban Chicago album-cover
manufacturer that has donated services to AEMMP since the class was
created.
   This year's musical entries were screened by AEMMP's
artists-and-repertoire committee, which selected five acts to
present to the entire class for a final decision.
   Suber said choosing the right act _ one with a fresh, yet
commercially palatable sound _ is the most difficult task the
students face.
   ``They have to change their attitude from music consumers to
music producers and that's not easy when you're a dedicated music
fan,'' Suber said.
   Student Henry Carpenter, who headed the arts-and-repertoire
committee, agreed.
   ``My personal taste in music is alternative music and heavy
metal,'' he said. ``But when we went through the tapes, I looked
for what I thought would be the most marketable product.''
   The Bad Examples, championed by O'Connor, emerged victorious
after an inter-class battle settled by field trips to two
nightclubs to see the finalists in action.
   ``Seeing them live and seeing the reaction of the people who go
to their show, I'm really behind the Bad Examples now,'' said
Carpenter, who had led the faction favoring another band. ``I'm
really confident they can get a major record deal.''

<HEAD>Cocoa Prices Hit 14-Year Low Before Rallying To Close Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa prices hit a 14-year low Wednesday before
recovering to finish the day higher on the London market.,
   The selling wave reflected the prospect of a glutted market for
the fifth consecutive season in 1988-89, traders said.
   Cocoa for July delivery closed at $1,158 a metric ton, up $1.64
from Tuesday's close. Earlier in the day, the contract traded at
the 14-year low of $1,140.
   Traders said most experts are predicting record world production
this season of about 2.3 million metric tons. That would be about
200,000 metric tons more than expected consumption, the biggest
surplus ever.
   In addition, signs that the Ivory Coast _ which has
international debts of more than $14 billion _ could be close to
abandoning its costly price-support policy also have encouraged
selling, traders said.
   The present price the government pays its cocoa farmers is equal
to about $1,312 a ton, traders said.
   Ivory Coast's international creditors have been pressing
strongly for a cut for some time, according to banking sources.
   Ivory Coast, which is Africa's biggest producer and relies on
cocoa for about a third of its export revenues, has for the past
year been refusing to sell at a price below its break-even level.
   As a result, the nation has accumulated stocks of about 400,000
tons, of which half already have been put into storage in Europe
for at least two years.
   Traders also said there was a likelihood of a record Ivorian
harvest of up to 720,000 tons, 100,000 tones more than initial
forecasts, for the October 1988-September-1989 season.

   The captain of the Exxon Valdez drank
alcoholic beverages with shipmates while ashore before the tanker
struck a reef in Prince William Sound, according to documents
released by a federal panel.
   A stack of documents released by the National Transportation
Safety Board on Tuesday contained interviews detailing drinking by
Capt. Joseph Hazelwood before the ship left Valdez, and on at least
one occasion aboard ship.
   The panel is investigating the nation's worst oil spill, caused
when the Exxon Valdez hit a reef on March 24 and spilled nearly 11
million gallons of crude oil.
   The ship's chief engineer, Jerzy Glowacki, and its radio officer
told investigators they went ashore with Hazelwood as the tanker
was being loaded, according to the documents.
   Glowacki and the radio officer said Hazelwood and a shipping
pilot had non-alcoholic drinks at a restaurant, while the others at
the table had beer.
   Hazelwood and his crewmen split up to do some shopping and met
later at a bar. The radio officer said when he arrived at about
4:30 p.m. March 23, Hazelwood and Glowacki already were there. He
said each bought one or more rounds of drinks.
   He said Hazelwood drank a clear beverage, Glowacki drank gin and
tonic and he drank beer. Glowacki told investigators he had three
gin and tonics, but did not recall how much Hazelwood had to drink.
   ``No further information could be developed concerning the
activities of the three men between lunch at the restaurant and
their meeting at the bar,'' the documents state.
   Glowacki said the three left the bar at about 7 p.m. and
returned to the restaurant where they had lunch and ordered two
pizzas. Glowacki and the radio officer agreed each of the three men
had one alcoholic drink as they waited.
   The radio officer also reported seeing Hazelwood drinking aboard
ship on one occasion, during a long voyage in February.
   According to the documents, Hazelwood admitted drinking
non-alcholic beer aboard the vessel on March 24.
   On Tuesday , shipping pilot William E. Murphy told the NTSB
panel that he smelled alcohol on Hazelwood's breath before the the
March 24 accident, but the captain did not act intoxicated.
   Other crewmen told the panel they didn't notice alcohol on
Hazelwood's breath.
   Third Mate Gregory T. Cousins, whom Hazelwood left in charge on
the vessel's bridge, testified Tuesday that the ship had been on
automatic pilot until 12 minutes before it ran aground in Prince
William Sound.
   Cousins, who was not certified to operate the ship, said he
could not explain why it was on automatic pilot when Exxon policy
limits use of the device to open waters.
   Murphy, who helped pilot the tanker through a narrow part of
Prince William Sound before the ship hit a charted reef, said that
he had a good opinion of Hazelwood's skill before the accident.
   ``I would characterize it as outstanding,'' he said.
   Hazelwood failed sobriety tests administered about nine hours
after the March 24 wreck.
   Murphy said Hazelwood smelled of alcohol but spoke clearly and
gave no sign of impaired judgment. Cousins and four other crew
members agreed that Hazelwood did not seem intoxicated but added
that they did not smell any alcohol on the captain.
   The witnesses said Exxon has a strict policy against alcohol or
drugs on board, and they testified they had never seen the policy
violated. They also said they had never had their bags searched for
alcohol or drugs.
   Cousins said Hazelwood had left the bridge to send out messages
from his office. Although leaving an uncertified crewman in charge
is against company policy, Cousins said other captains have left
him alone at the helm for brief periods.
   Murphy, who left the ship about 45 minutes before it ran
aground, said he found it unusual that Hazelwood was not on the
bridge for much of the time.
   Cousins said Hazelwood had ordered the 987-foot tanker out of
the normal traffic lanes to avoid ice.
   Cousins said he tried to change course back toward the lanes,
but the ship did not respond. He tried a sharper turn but the
tanker continued toward Bligh Reef.
   ``It's a source of trouble for me as to why the vessel did not
track away from that track line,'' he said.
   Moments before the wreck, Cousins called Hazelwood.
   ``I said to him at that time, `I think we're in serious
trouble.' At the end of that talk is when I felt the initial
shock,'' he said.
   ``Several seconds passed and we experienced a series of jolts to
the vessel. By the time we came to a full stop, I'd estimate we
felt a series of six jolts,'' he recalled.
   ``There seemed to be a hesitation, and I spun the wheel hard
left. By that time I believe we were hard aground.''
   Cousins said there had been no discussion earlier about reducing
speed as it neared the ice. Slowing down would have made the ship
harder to maneuver, he said.
   The Exxon Valdez was traveling between half and full speed at
the time of the accident, according to testimony.
   After the grounding, Hazelwood returned to the bridge and
ordered crew members to assess the damage. Then he tried to rock
the tanker free without success, Cousins said.
   ``I cannot think of anything I could've done differently,''
Cousins concluded.
   During the five days of hearings, the panel plans to question
more than two dozen witnesses, including Coast Guard personnel and
Exxon executives. Hazelwood, who is charged with operating a vessel
while drunk, will not testify. The fired captain is free on bail
and faces trial June 20 in Valdez.
   The panel includes representatives of the state, Exxon, the
Coast Guard and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., a consortium of oil
companies that runs the 800-mile trans-Alaska pipeline.
   The board's report on the cause of the accident will take up to
a year to complete.

   The U.S. dollar rose sharply in Europe on
Wednesday, benefiting from a smaller-than-expected U.S. trade
deficit in March.
   Gold prices in Europe dropped to a 33-month low, while silver
was trading at a 26-month low.
   In late European trading, the dollar had moved to a 34-month
high against the Swiss franc, a 32-month high against the Italian
lira, a 30-month high against the French franc and a 28-month high
against the Dutch guilder.
   In London, the British pound slumped to a 20-month low, dropping
to $1.6140 from $1.6398 late Tuesday.
   The dollar also rose in Tokyo to a 18-month high against the
Japanese yen, closing up 0.70 yen at 137.70 yen. Later, in London,
it pushed up further to 138.95 yen.
   After fluctuating in a narrow range early Wednesday, the dollar
surged when the U.S. government reported an unexpectedly narrow
trade deficit of $8.9 billion in March and revised the February
deficit to $9.8 billion down from $10.9 billion.
   Economists had anticipated a $10 billion deficit for the most
recent month.
   ``Since there was no sign of central bank interventions,
everybody was buying,'' said a trader in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Selected late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday:
1.9675 West German marks, up from 1.9426; 1.7580 Swiss francs, up
from 1.7360; 6.6607 French francs, up from 6.5685; 2.2150 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1820; 1,433.00 Italian lire, up from 1,408.75;
1.1925 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1892.
   Gold, apparently pushed lower by the stronger U.S. dollar, fell
in London to a late bid price of $370.75 a troy ounce, down from
$374.25 bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to $370.25 bid from $374.40 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.25 to a closing bid of
$374.74.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.46 a
troy ounce, down from $5.55 bid late Tuesday.

   A federal judge has signed a consent decree
formally ending a nearly 4-year printers strike against the Chicago
Tribune.
   Both sides had previously accepted and signed the basic accord,
which includes an $8.56 million settlement fund, a new three-year
contract and withdrawal of a federal lawsuit filed by the Chicago
Typographical Union No. 16.
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen signed the consent decree
Monday.
   Fifty-one printers who accepted a 1986 unconditional offer to
return to work can remain under terms of the new contract, which
took effect Jan. 3, or take a $30,000 buyout.
   Of the 240 original strikers, 119 remain out of work. They will
receive lump-sum payments based on age and tenure ranging from
about $30,000 to $90,000 and will receive company-paid medical
insurance after age 65.
   The strike resulted from the Tribune's desire to gain greater
control in hiring and assigning printers in the composing room.
   The printers' lawsuit alleged the company had violated a 1975
agreement in which they were guaranteed lifetime employment in
exchange for the introduction of labor-saving technology.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minorco SA, the South Africa-controlled mining
concern, said Wednesday it will continue pursuing natural resources
companies despite its failed $5.9 billion bid for Consolidated Gold
Fields PLC.
   Luxembourg-based Minorco on Tuesday conceded defeat in its
eight-month takeover attempt for Gold Fields in a deal that would
have created the world's largest gold company.
   The concession came after a federal judge in New York refused to
lift an order blocking Minorco from acquiring more than 30 percent
of Gold Fields before the bid was to expire under British takeover
regulations.
   Minorco, which is 60 percent owned by the Oppenheimer family's
Anglo American Corp. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. gold and
diamond mining interests, said its board would meet next month to
decide the company's next move.
   Minorco remains the largest single shareholder in the British
mining giant with a 29.9 percent stake, and deciding whether to
hold on to or sell it likely will be on the board's agenda.
   ``We will now energetically implement our strategy of
transforming Minorco into an operating company,'' Minorco Chief
Executive Sir Michael Edwardes said.
   Minorco had pursued Gold Fields to fulfill that goal.
   ``Minorco is now a familiar name in the market, both in the U.K.
and overseas, and has a very positive future,'' Edwardes said.
   Keith Irons, a Minorco vice president, said he expects the
company to progress toward its strategic goal of being a ``global
business operating in natural resources mainly through 100 percent
owned subsidiaries.''
   That means Minorco might increase or sell one or more of its
existing partial stakes.
   Besides the Gold Fields stake, which represents about one-third
of Minorco's $4 billion in assets, the company also owns 30 percent
of Engelhard Corp. and 48 percent of Adobe Resources Corp., both of
the United States.
   Minorco also holds 56 percent of Inspiration Resources Corp. of
the United States, but controls just 42 percent of the votes.
   In Britain, the company has a 36 percent stake in Charter
Consolidated PLC. The company has $1 billion in cash and borrowing
facilities of $2.3 billion good until September 1991, Irons said,
adding that Minorco would continue to focus on North America and
Europe.

   The stock market staged a moderate advance today
in response to a better-than-expected report on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.29 to 2,467.74
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 853 up, 549
down and 510 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit narrowed to $8.86 billion in March from a
downward-revised $9.82 billion the month before.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street had called for a March deficit
of $10 billion or more.
   The news sent the dollar higher in foreign exchange. But
analysts said it got a less exuberant response in the bond and
stock markets, in part because it suggested that the pace of the
domestic economy might not be slowing as much as had been hoped.
   In addition, brokers said traders were staying cautious ahead of
the scheduled report from the government Thursday on the consumer

   There is some concern on Wall Street that the figures will cast
doubts on the belief that the Federal Reserve is beginning to

<HEAD>San Juan Airlines To Stop Flying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   San Juan Airlines will stop flying
and close its headquarters in Port Angeles if the Canadian
government approves the sale of its four Canadian routes to Horizon
Air, San Juan President Jim Sherrell said.
   ``This is the end of a long era,'' Sherrell said Monday. ``It's
tough to let that go.''
   San Juan will continue to operate its Shuttle Express ground
transportation service at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   San Juan describes itself as the nation's oldest commuter
airline. Its roots go back to Orcas Island Air Service, which began
flying from Orcas Island in the San Juan archipelago to Bellingham,
Wash., in 1947. Sherrell bought the airline in 1979.
   The decision on selling the routes is expected this summer from
Canada's national transportation agency. The sale already has been
authorized by the U.S. Department of Transportation and won
conditional approval from Canada.
   Horizon already is flying the routes, though technically they
still belong to San Juan.
   San Juan has been cutting back flight operations since December,
when it announced that a preliminary sales agreement had been
reached with Horizon on the Port Angeles-Victoria,
Seattle-Vancouver, Bellingham-Vancouver and Seattle-Victoria routes.
   At one time, San Juan employed about 230 people. Only a year
ago, it had 128 workers in Port Angeles, making it one of Clallam
County's top industrial employers.
   Today, just 15 people still work for the airline in Port
Angeles, and a dozen of those jobs should be phased out in 30 days,
Sherrell said.
   San Juan once served Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia;
Portland, Ore.; Seattle, Everett, Bellingham and Port Angeles,
Wash.; and the San Juan Islands. Now the company makes a single
round trip five days a week between Port Angeles and Friday Harbor.
   This year, San Juan has reduced its fleet from 15 aircraft to a
single Cessna 402.
   Sherrell said changes in the commuter airline market were
responsible for the decision to sell San Juan's Canadian routes.
Small, independent commuter airlines are facing increasing
competition from regional carriers, which are growing and aligning
with major airlines, he said.
   ``I didn't want to get out of the airline industry,'' Sherrell
said. ``Time dictated that we get out of it.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors
continued to be influenced by forecasts of heavy rains in western
crop areas.
   Prices have been driven lower in recent sessions because of
government and private forecasts of above-average rainfall in parts
of Iowa, Minnesota and other western crop states affected recently
by dry weather.
   In addition to the weather forecasts, soybeans were pressured by
the continued strength of the dollar, which is cutting European
demand for U.S. soymeal.
   ``We're not seeing much business,'' said Cathy Leow, analyst
with Thomsom McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York. ``But we don't
expect to see much business this time of year,'' with the South
Americans coming into the market.
   Corn futures were lower, forced down by commission house and
professional selling. However, analysts say there is some
expectation that corn should recover, after trading on the same
weather forecasts since Monday.
   Wheat prices were up on reports of heavy exporter buying and
indications that domestic users are starting to buy, Ms. Leow said.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents lower to 3\ cents higher, with
the contract for delivery in May at $4.07{ a bushel; corn was a {
cent to 1{ cents lower with May at $2.77 a bushel; oats were a 3
cents lower to a { cents higher with May at $1.81 a bushel;
soybeans were a { cent to 5{ cents lower with May at $7.30.

   The stock market gained ground today with a lift
from a better-than-expected report on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 15.03 to 2,468.48
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 908 up, 541 down and
501 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit narrowed to $8.86 billion in March from a
downward-revised $9.82 billion the month before.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street had called for a March deficit
of $10 billion or more.
   The news sent the dollar higher in foreign exchange. But
analysts said it got a less exuberant response in the bond and
stock markets, in part because it suggested that the pace of the
domestic economy might not be slowing as much as had been hoped.
   In addition, brokers said traders were staying cautious ahead of
the scheduled report from the government Thursday on the consumer
price index for April.
   There is some concern on Wall Street that the figures will cast
doubts on the belief that the Federal Reserve is beginning to
succeed in its effort to restrain inflation.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up 1] at
53[; Philip Morris, up 2{ at 135]; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,
up \ at 34[, and Eastman Kodak, up ] at 43].
   Prime Computer fell 1~ to 15~. MAI Basic Four Inc. said late

   Upjohn gained { to 33\. The company said the Food and Drug

Upjohn is working on for treatment of head injuries.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.06 to 176.98. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.29 at 351.21.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 161.45 million shares with an

   Northrop Corp.'s revenue on the B-2 stealth
bomber amounted to $657 million, or about half the company's
overall sales, for the first quarter, the company disclosed in a
letter to shareholders.
   The disclosure Tuesday marked the first time the firm has
revealed how much it has taken in from the bomber. The sales figure
was almost exactly what most analysts had been estimating since
Northrop began the B-2 program in 1981.
   Sales overall for the first quarter were $1.28 billion, with a
profit of $9.7 million that was down sharply from the $139.6
million profit of a year ago, the company said. Quarterly sales the
year before were $1.37 billion.
   Northrop failed to disclose stealth sales figures for the first
quarter of last year, saying that information remained classified
by the Air Force.
   Wolfgang Demisch, an analysts at UBS Securities, said revenue
from the bomber appeared to be declining.

   The U.S. government reported that the American merchandise trade
deficit narrowed in March to $8.9 billion from a revised $9.8

   The trade news sent the dollar's value higher in

   Steel imports in March fell to their lowest
level in six years and their share of the domestic market shrank to
17.2 percent, well within the goal of the U.S. import quotas, a
domestic industry group said Wednesday.
   The month's 1.22 million tons of imports represented just 12.9
percent of the market when excluding 129,000 tons of semi-finished
steel U.S. companies imported to supply their own mills, according
to an importers group.
   ``Semifinished imports have been in critical demand by U.S.
rolling mills since early 1988,'' said John Griffin, president of
the American Institute for Imported Steel of New York, which
represents importers.
   Exports, meanwhile, rose in March to 606,000 tons, the largest
monthly total since July 1974.
   First quarter exports totaled 1.1 million tons, compared with
303,000 tons in the 1988 first quarter, the American Iron and Steel
Institute in Washington, which represents domestic producers, said.
   The rival groups interpret Commerce Department information to
serve their competing interests.
   The domestic group said steel prices in foreign markets are
higher than in the United States, making this country less
attractive to foreign producers.
   The leading steel-producing nations appear to be shipping less
metal in than authorized under the individual quotas they
negotiated with the United States, the AISI said. Foreign producers
undershipped their quotas by 25 percent last year.
   Imports were 1.34 million tons in February and 1.84 million tons
in March 1988.
   The 1.22 million tons shipped this March was the lowest since
April 1983. The import tonnage represented even less of the
domestic supply because shipments by U.S. producers were higher
that month, the AISI said.
   The five-year quotas instituted by former President Reagan in
late 1984 were intended to limit foreign steel to around 20 percent
of the U.S. market. Domestic steelmakers are campaigning to have
them renewed beyond their Sept. 31 expiration.

<HEAD>Nation's Top Ports Vying For World's Largest Cruise Ship</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORT EVERGLADES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Port Everglades Director Joel
Alesi swivels around in his leather desk chair, he surveys gleaming
white cruise ships embarking on tropical voyages and giant cranes
unloading cargo vessels at the nation's second-busiest cruise port.
   But in his mind's eye, he envisions a mammoth passenger ship _
bigger than the biggest aircraft carrier _ gliding in from the
Atlantic.
   The dream is also shared by port officials in Miami and near
Cape Canaveral as the competition intensifies for the largest
cruise ship ever proposed.
   Although the Phoenix World City ship is still anchored to the
drawing boards, three ports that handle nearly 80 percent of the
world's cruise ship business are locked in a winner-take-all battle
to become the vessel's home port when _ and if _ it ever sails.
   At stake, say port officials, is a greater share of the rapidly
growing $5.5 billion passenger ship industry and the prestige of
hosting a vessel more massive than the three largest cruise ships
combined.
   Each port director believes he holds the proper blend of
location and amenities to come out on top when the home port is
announced this summer.
   ``We feel we are in very favorable position _ both
geographically and physically _ to accommodate the Phoenix,''
boasted Alesi at the Fort Lauderdale-area port.
   ``I think we have an extremely good shot,'' said Charles
Rowland, executive director of Port Canaveral. ``We're an
up-and-coming port and can give the Phoenix special attention.''
   ``The question is can the Phoenix afford not to come to Miami?''
asked Carmen Lunetta, director of the Port of Miami, which handled
65 percent of the world's 3.5 million cruise passengers last year,
making it No. 1.
   John Rogers, spokesman for the New York-based World City Corp.,
said a home port decision should be made in 30 to 45 days. Until
then, company policy prohibits any comments about the project, he
said.
   Billed in its promotional literature as a ``daring project by
virtue of its size and cost,'' the estimated $1.3 billion Phoenix
project was conceived by Knut Utstein Kloster, who resigned in 1986
as chairman of Kloster Group, owners of Norwegian Caribbean Lines
and Royal Viking Line.
   The plans call for its 5,200 passengers to be housed in three
hotels on the 1,260-foot twin-hulled vessel, more than 200 feet
longer than any operating cruise ship.
   Along its ``Main Street'' would be a chapel, cafes, a
100,000-volume library and a 2,500-seat theater large enough to
handle a Broadway musical.
   At 250,000 registered tons, the proposed ship would be heavier
than the combined weight of the three largest cruise ships. Since
no Caribbean port would be deep enough to handle the ship, on-board
yachts would ferry passengers and the 1,850-member crew.
   Rogers said World City is negotiating with West German
shipbuilders for a scheduled 1992 completion date, but no deal has
been struck.
   The 2,600-passenger Sovereign of the Seas, owned by Miami-based
Royal Caribbean Lines, is considered the world's largest cruise
ship measured by gross tons. But other ships are longer, such as
the 963-foot Queen Elizabeth II and the 1,041-foot France.
   Industry representatives from around the world at a recent Miami
convention predicted the number of cruise ship passengers should
continue to grow at 12 percent annually, topping 22 million
passengers by 2000.
   The efforts to lure the ship are nearly as grand as the project
itself.
   At Canaveral, port officials have offered to lease World City 95
acres of land to build four 350-room hotels and a marina.
Meanwhile, a new dock for the Phoenix is expected to cost between
$70 million and $90 million.
   Canaveral, which handled 644,000 passengers last year, is
expected to add at least two new cruise ships by next year, said
Rowland.
   He also said World City has been studying other cruise lines'
tie-ins with nearby attractions such as Disney World and Sea World.
   ``I don't see how the World City people could ask for anything
more than what we have here,'' said Rowland.
   But that's what they are saying in Miami and Port Everglades.
   Alesi said plans to build a 1,000-room hotel complex and
convention center at Port Everglades are enticing to Phoenix
planners. In addition, the port is the deepest in Florida and less
than 1{ miles from the main Atlantic shipping lanes.
   ``Just in terms of our location, we have to be attractive to the
Phoenix,'' said Alesi, whose port handled 1.6 million cruise
passengers last year.
   In Miami, which expects 3 million cruise passengers this year,
Lunetta said the port is the obvious choice for the world's largest
cruise ship.
   ``We could get ready to handle the Phoenix in 12 months,'' said
Lunetta, who plans to meet with World City executives in New York
later this month. ``It's only natural that the ship come here.''
   From his office near the port, Jay Lewis views the scrambling
with skepticism.
   Lewis, president of Market Scope Inc., a cruise industry
consulting firm, says he is still not convinced Kloster can muster
the financing for the project.
   ``The only thing that's heating up is the competition with the
ports,'' said Lewis. ``I don't think the project is going anywhere
at the moment.''

<HEAD>Local Convention Delegates Election Highlights Division on `Team
Concept'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A United Auto Workers local election
completed Wednesday shows division in the union over the
Japanese-style ``team concept'' management adopted a year ago at
General Motors Corp.'s local Camaro factory.
   Candidates unhappy with the system at GM's Van Nuys plant won
five of seven positions as Local 645's delegates to the UAW's
annual national convention, which runs June 18-22 in Anaheim.
   Opponents believe the company takes advantage of cooperative
management to erase work rules it couldn't negotiate away at the
bargaining table. Union leaders want to give the concept a chance.
   The Van Nuys plant has about 4,000 workers. Voting began
Tuesday, with night shift workers casting their ballots early
Wednesday morning.
   The five successful candidates who ran as opponents of the team
concept were Cal Gutierrez, 876 votes; Pete Lopez, 846 votes; Jake
Flukers, 760 votes; Leroy Padilla, 709 votes; and Mark Masaoka, 699
votes.
   The two other winners, who favor the team concept, were
bargaining committee chairman Richard Ruppert, 828 votes, and
financial secretary-treasurer Joe Garcia, 758 votes.
   Results were released by the union's assistant regional
director, Henry Gonzalez, who said the local president and vice
president did not run.
   Opponents of team management are part of a nationwide movement
within the UAW that calls itself New Directions and favors a more
confrontational approach to GM management. Led by union locals at
GM plants around St. Louis and Detroit, the movement is expected to
challenge the union's leadership at the convention.
   Gonzalez argued in an interview Tuesday that the team system is
slowly improving the lot of workers in Van Nuys. He suggested the
issue was created to use against union leaders.
   ``Anybody that's on the outside looking in has to create an
issue to run against, and I guess their issue is the team
concept,'' Gonzalez said.
   The team management system was instituted last year at plant,
which produces Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds.
   The change came after current union leaders won a close election
in June 1988, ousting officers opposed to cooperation.
   Under the new system, workers are divided into teams of six, and
those teams take part in decisions on how their jobs will be done.
Backers note the systems give a worker the power to stop the
assembly line to make sure his or her task is done right. That
power is said to be a key ingredient in worker satisfaction.
   Dissidents point to temporary layoffs imposed at the plant since
then to buttress their argument that the new system didn't really
save jobs as it was supposed to.
   Management says the so-called rolling layoffs were needed
because of lack of demand for the cars. The other Camaro and
Firebird plant, in Norwood, Ohio, was shut down and some in the
union believe that was because the company saw the Van Nuys
workforce as more accommodating.

<HEAD>FDIC Chairman: Agency Needs Power To Curb Broker Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. said Wednesday his agency needs additional power to curb
abuses by banks and savings institutions that raise high-cost
deposits through brokers.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, testifying before a House
Banking subcommittee, split from other bank regulators who said
current law provides them with enough authority.
   The practice of raising deposits through brokers has been
criticized for making the savings and loan crisis worse. The funds,
raised through brokers who earn fees by channeling clients' money
to institutions paying the highest interest rates, has allowed some
shaky institutions to grow far more rapidly than they could have
through local deposits.
   Healthy banks and S&amp;Ls object to the practice because they often
have to raise their rates to compete.
   But all the regulators, including Seidman, said brokered
deposits, used properly, can be beneficial, allowing institutions
to raise money to make a big loan or meet a temporary cash crunch.
Sometimes they are the only way for troubled institutions to stay
afloat while they wait the government to shut them down.
   Forbidding brokered deposits ``is a little bit like saying we
should abolish the manufacturing of automobiles because some people
drive too fast,'' said Comptroller of the Currency Robert L.
Clarke, who regulates nationally chartered banks.
   Clark, Federal Reserve Board member H. Robert Heller and Federal
Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, who oversees savings
and loans, told the Subcommittee on General Oversight and
Investigations that brokered deposits are currently under control.
They recommended further study before enacting legislation on the
subject.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, sponsored a provision on
brokered deposits in S&amp;L bailout legislation, which passed the
Senate last month. It would bar weak institutions from using
deposits brokers unless the institutions get a waiver from the FDIC.
   That is the reverse of the current practice under which brokered
deposits are assumed to be permissible unless regulators say
otherwise.
   Rep. Stephen Neal, D-N.C., sponsored a similar section in a bill
passed earlier this month by the House Banking Committee.
   Rep. Carroll Hubbard, D-Ky., chairman of the subcommittee, said
he held Wednesday's hearing to serve as a basis for debate when the
S&amp;L legislation reaches the House floor.
   But he said he has not yet decided whether to attempt to delete
the brokered deposit clause.
   Seidman, who under President Bush's proposal to close or merge
failed S&amp;Ls, would get broad new power to oversee savings and loans
in addition to commercial banks, said he would not object getting
specific authority to act against brokered deposits.
   Regulators currently must prove the deposits are being used
unsafely before they can act.
   But Seidman said he would prefer his agency to be permitted to
curb brokered deposits at healthy institutions, which at times use
them unwisely, and that it be able to set general rules on brokered
deposits rather than be forced to grant waivers to individual
institutions.
   Murkowski, testifying before Hubbard's panel, said securities
brokers, who earn fees for placing deposits, are lobbying against
his proposal.
   The deposits have soared in popularity, particularly after
investors fled the market following the 1987 stock crash.
   He said brokered deposits now account for 7.4 percent of S&amp;L
deposits, up from 2.6 percent for S&amp;Ls in June 1983. They account
for 5.3 percent of commercial bank deposits, he said.

   The Democratic-controlled Congress gave final
approval Wednesday to legislation raising the minimum wage for the
first time in eight years, but President Bush said it was
``inevitable'' he would kill the measure with the first veto of his
administration.
   The vote was 63-37 to approve the plan, which would boost the
minimum wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by October 1991. That vote
left supporters four votes shy of the 67 needed in the Senate to
override Bush's veto.
   Only hours earlier Bush had vowed anew that his first veto
awaits the bill.
   ``For me the choice is very clear,'' Bush said. ``If the
majority of the Congress rejects my offer of a reasonable
compromise _ and we have made such a proposal _ a veto is going to
be inevitable.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that when the
legislation reaches the president's desk, Bush will veto it
``instantly, faster than the eye can see.''
   Majority Democrats are also short of that two-thirds override
margin in the House, which passed the bill earlier this month, but
sponsors have promised a veto override attempt nonetheless as part
of an escalating political battle over the minimum wage and a
larger symbolic clash for momentum on domestic initiatives.
   Nonetheless, being able get a minimum-wage bill out of Congress
was a symbolic victory of sorts for its sponsors, who for the past
eight years could not get their proposal even that far because of
then-President Reagan's vehement opposition.
   And they vowed to advance another bill if Bush quashes the
measure passed Wednesday.
   ``We want to make it very clear that this fight is not going to
go away and we are going to continue this battle until we get a
fair and just increase in the minimum wage,'' Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., told reporters after the vote.
   Democratic congressional leaders are planning a mock signing
ceremony before formally transmitting the measure to the White
House, and plan to hold the bill until after Congress returns from
a Memorial Day recess so that Bush cannot veto it while sponsors
are away from Washington.
   Leading the GOP effort in Wednesday's debate, Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, said the legislation ``will translate into the loss of
hundreds of thousands of jobs and job opportunities for those who
most need our help.''
   But Kennedy, the measure's Senate sponsor, rejected such
assertions and made a final call for Bush to change his position.
   ``The fundamental issue, the overriding issue is whether the
Congress of the United State will once again make the minimum wage
a living wage and thereby ease the burden of poverty pressing down
on millions of our fellow citizens on the lowest rung of the
economic ladder,'' Kennedy said. ``The administration proposal is a
sham.''
   In a lengthy attack on Bush's stance, Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell said the president was choosing the wrong issue on
which to test his political muscle, saying the eight year freeze in
the floor wage has cost minimum-wage workers 40 percent of their
buying power.
   ``It is unconscionable and unfair to the weakest and most
vulnerable workers in our country to hold their wages hostage in
this way,'' the Maine Democrat said. ``There should be another,
better way for this test of political will to be conducted than at
their expense.''
   The minimum-wage fight has been brewing since Congress convened
in January, with the arguments little changed although the
legislation itself has been revised significantly since its
introduction, with the final product emerging from a House-Senate
conference committee three weeks ago.
   Sponsors of the leadership measure trimmed their final minimum
wage target from $4.65 to $4.55 but moved up the dates the three,
annual incremental increases are to take effect from January to
October. They also added a provision allowing employers to pay
employees with fewer than 60 days' work experience a subminimum
wage.
   Still the final product is far from a more modest proposal for
Bush, who from the outset has adopted a take-it-or-leave-it stance.
The president's measure, rejected by both the House and Senate,
called for a $4.25 an hour wage floor by January 1992 but would
allow employers to pay all new hires a subminimum for up to six
months regardless of prior work experience.
   Most Democrats have denounced Bush's ``training wage'' proposal
as a blatant attempt to allow employers to skirt paying the minimum
wage. Republicans have countered that it would protect thousands of
jobs that they say will be lost if the minimum wage is increased
and said the Democrats' two-month provision is too restrictive and
would require burdensome record-keeping.
   Bush has been urged by pro-business lobbying forces to venture
outside of Washington for an elaborate veto ceremony in a community
in the South or West where the president could present his argument
about the potential for massive job losses if the minimum wage is
increased without establishing a six-month subminimum. The White
House has not said whether Bush will do so.

<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said
Wednesday it would cut certain long-distance prices by about $140
million to comply with a new federal regulatory plan.
   The price cuts will take effect on July 1, the same time the
Federal Communications Commission's new price-cap plan begins.
   Under the price-cap plan adopted March 16, the FCC limits the
prices AT&amp;T charges rather than the profits it makes.
   The new cuts will bring rates for consumers and small businesses
down to the maximum permitted by the new regulation, AT&amp;T spokesman
Bryant Steele said.
   AT&amp;T's prices for large businesses had already been brought
below the price cap.
   The latest decrease will bring AT&amp;T's total interstate
long-distance price reductions to almost 40 percent in the five
years since the Bell System breakup, the company said.
   MCI Communications Corp. spokeswoman Pam Small said the mandated
cut was not a surprise. ``It's a small number, probably smaller
than we would have expected,'' she said.
   US Sprint Communications Co. spokesman Syd Courson said the
company would have no comment until its analysts had scanned the
price filing.
   Under the filing:
   _Prices on general long-distance service will drop about $60
million a year.
   _The Reach Out America discount calling plan for consumers will
be expanded at no extra charge. Prices of the basic and evening
bonus versions of Reach Out America will be cut.
   _The international Reach Out calling plan will be expanded from
four to 25 countries.
   _AT&amp;T will cut prices on calls its customers make between Mexico
and the United States and on calls from the United States to the
Philippines, Denmark, the Faeroe Islands in the North Atlantic,
Finland, Norway and Sweden. AT&amp;T also will cut prices on
international calls from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   _When holidays occur during the weekend but are legally observed
on a weekday, AT&amp;T will apply its holiday prices on the weekday the
holiday is observed.

<HEAD>Bush Won't Block Possible Foreign Acquisition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will not block the possible
foreign acquisition of Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s interest in a
joint venture with a European company, the administration said
Wednesday.
   Bush made his decision after an investigation by an inter-agency
committee headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. The
president has the power to block foreign acquisitions of American
companies if the sales would endanger national security.
   The latest review involved a joint venture between Westinghouse
and ASEA Brown Boveri LTD (ABB), a manufacturing firm based in
Switzerland.
   The joint venture, known as Westinghouse-ABB Power T&amp;D Co., was
created earlier in the year to manufacture and sell high-voltage
electrical transmission equipment.
   In announcing Bush's decision, the administration said ABB had
confirmed its intention to continue manufacturing the high voltage
transformers in the United States even if it did excercise its
option under the agreement to purchase Westinghouse's share of the
joint venture.
   Under the agreement, Westinghouse, which is based in Pittsburgh,
now owns 55 percent of the joint venture and ABB owns 45 percent.
   The joint company planned to serve the electrical transmission
markets in the United States, Brazil and Argentina with expected
annual sales of $1 billion, according to a company news release.
   The operation employs 10,000 workers in 20 Westinghouse
facilities and three ABB facilities in the United States and Latin
America, the company said.

   Florida officials on Wednesday accused the penny
stock brokerage Blinder, Robinson and Co. Inc. of a variety of
securities law violations and moved to kick the firm out of the
state.
   Comptroller Gerald Lewis said the state named 29 former and
current employees in a civil action to revoke their licenses,
including company President Meyer Blinder and his son, vice
president Larry Blinder.
   Denver-based Blinder, which has offices in 37 states _ including
10 in Florida _ and the District of Columbia was ordered to
immediately stop violating Florida securities laws.
   The company has 21 days to ask for a hearing to stop its Florida
licenses from being revoked.
   Rick Rouse, director of compliance for Blinder, Robinson,
expressed his confidence that the firm was acting in full
compliance with Floirda law, and said it would vigorously defend
itself against the charges.
   ``I feel it is totally irresponsible for the department not to
have related its concerns to me before they filed charges,'' Rouse
said in a statement issued Wednesday. ``Whenever there have been
problems, we have addressed them.''
   The alleged Florida violations could result in more than $5
million in fines.
   The action followed a 2{-year state investigation of Blinder
triggered by numerous complaints and queries from clients, Lewis
said at a news conference.
   The brokerage already is under investigation by state and
federal authorities elsewhere. The Florida comptroller's case is
being turned over to state prosecutors for possible criminal action.
   ``The history of their company is one of litigation,'' Lewis
said. ``We're ready for battle.''
   Thousands of investors in Florida are believed to have been
bilked by Blinder, which has been licensed in the state since 1973,
securities officials said. The officials said they did not have a
figure for the total amount of the alleged fraud.
   Penny stocks are low-priced, thinly traded securities that
generally cost less than $5 per share and are traded over the
counter rather than on a stock exchange.
   Lewis said alleged violations included manipulations in the
market for certain penny stocks, sale of unregistered securities,
unreasonable markups, failure to maintain proper records and
supervise employees, and unauthorized trading.
   He charged that in one case where an 80-year-old client lost
about $30,000 on penny stocks, Blinder employees bought and sold
stocks without the client's permission, conducted excessive stock
trades just to earn commissions and inflated the purchase price of
certain stock.
   The firm's troubles with the Securities and Exchange Commission
date to 1980 and include a probe initiated by the SEC in April 1987
into allegations that Blinder, Robinson had defrauded customers.
   The SEC has been investigating allegations dating to August 1983
that Blinder, Robinson violated federal law by marketing nine
distributions of unregistered securities, by falsely representing
the business prospects of the companies involved, and by
excessively marking up the prices of the securities.
   The SEC had two other actions pending against the company for
alleged bookkeeping violations.
   Last month, a U.S. District Court judge in Denver dismissed
charges in one of those cases _ a 1983 civil case against Blinder
and his brokerage _ and chastised the SEC for misconduct.
   Company attorneys have contended that the government had a
vendetta against the firm and Blinder said negative publicity
devastated business in 1988.
   Blinder began its business in Westbury, Long Island, N.Y., and
moved its headquarters to Denver in the late 1970s.

<HEAD>Dutch Official Optimistic About Boeing 747-400 Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official of the Dutch Transport Ministry
thinks talks Wednesday with Boeing Co. will resolve differences
over some changes the Netherlands and three other European nations
want made in Boeing 747-400 jetliners.
   Boeing spokesmen remained mum on the discussions in Seattle,
except to confirm they had started.
   But Henrik Wolleswinkel, leader of the Dutch negotiators meeting
with Boeing and of the European team that will certify the new jet,
was optimistic about the talks.
   In an interview with The Seattle Times before the discussions
began, Wolleswinkel said he believes a temporary operating permit
might be issued, and that the European agencies might give Boeing
one to three years to modify the plane to their standards.
   Regulatory agencies in the Netherlands, France, Britain and West
Germany have asked Boeing to modify the design of floor beams
supporting the new jets' upper decks and to provide better
separation of some electrical circuits. The four agencies form the
Joint Airworthiness Requirements Committee.
   Dutch Transport Ministry spokesman Harald Hameleers has
characterized the changes as minor. ``We think the 747-400 is a
safe plane but there is always room for improvement,'' he said.
   Boeing spokesman David Jimenez said the aircraft maker was not
commenting on the issues raised by the Europeans. ``We're keeping
that for the table,'' he said, ``but we are confident that these
discussions will lead to approval.''
   The Dutch are taking a lead role in the issue, and
representatives of the other European agencies have said the
Netherlands speaks in the name of all four.
   On Thursday, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is to become the first
European carrier to take delivery of a 747-400. The Europeans'
objections have called that delivery date into question, but
Wolleswinkel said he expects the plane to fly to Amsterdam as
scheduled.
   He also said a temporary operating permit might be issued to
allow the plane to enter commercial service.
   The 747-400, which Boeing began delivering earlier this year, is
the world's largest passenger aircraft, capable of carrying 412
passengers more than 8,000 miles.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Drop on Release of Trade Figures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures were down sharply Wednesday on New
York's Commodity Exchange as investors bailed out following release
of better-than-expected balance of trade figures.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower,
energy prices were down, and livestock prices were down as meat
prices rallied.
   Gold settled $2.20 to $2.30 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in May at $373.20 a troy ounce; silver was 7.1 cents to
7.9 cents lower with May at $5.429 a troy ounce; platinum was
$11.40 to $13.40 lower with May at $509.90 a troy ounce.
   The decline in metal prices came as the Commerce Department
released figures indicating that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to
$8.86 billion in March as a record level of export sales helped to
offset rising oil imports.
   ``The continued strength of the dollar also adversely affected
metals,'' said Don Tierney, an analyst with Stanley Bell &amp; Co. in
New York.
   As the value of the dollar increases, its investment value
surpasses precious metals.
   Despite a recent report that the supply of platinum will
continue to fall short of supplies, platinum futures also were hit
by heavy selling.
   But Peter Cardillo, an analyst with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New
York, said the precious metals market is oversold at current levels.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade as investors continued to be influenced by
forecasts of heavy rains in western crop areas.
   Prices have been driven lower in recent sessions because of
government and private forecasts of above-average rainfall in parts
of Iowa, Minnesota and other western crop states affected recently
by dry weather.
   Soybeans also were pressured by the continued strength of the
dollar, which is cutting European demand for U.S. soymeal.
   ``We're not seeing much business,'' said Cathy Leow, analyst
with Thomsom McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York. ``But we don't
expect to see much business this time of year,'' with the South
Americans coming into the market.
   Corn futures were lower and wheat prices were up on reports of
export buying and indications that domestic users are starting to
buy, Ms. Leow said.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents lower to 3\ cents higher with
May at $4.07{ a bushel; corn was a \ cent to 1{ cents lower with
May at $2.77\ a bushel; oats were a { cents lower to a { cents
higher with May at $1.83{ a bushel; soybeans were a { cent to 5
cents lower with May at $7.29{.
   Energy futures were lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
with gasoline prices off sharply.
   The dropoff in gasoline prices was triggered by an American
Petroleum Institute report that imports of crude oil rose 15.2
percent in April, an average of 8.035 million barrels a day
compared to 6.97 million in 1988.
   There also was concern that overproduction by Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Nations would continue past the group's meeting
in June, said Robert Baker, an energy analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 17 cents to 57 cents lower
with June at $20.13 a barrel; heating oil was 1.15 cents to 1.25
cents lower with June at 47.96 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .43 cent to 2.53 cents lower with June at 63.27 cents a gallon.
   Trading in the cattle market was quiet in anticipation of the
Agriculture Department's release of the cattle-on-feed report.
   The report, released after the close of trading, indicated
higher than expected April marketings and feedlot placement. High
placements in feed lots could mean lower cash prices later in the
year.
   Pork belly prices were up the daily trading limit amid
short-covering and technical buy signals, said Paul Hare, an
analyst with Linnco Futures Inc. in Chicago. The advance was fueled
by expectations of renewed retail demand for bacon. Hogs were
higher, lifted by spillover support from pork bellies.
   Live cattle were .32 cent lower to .07 cent higher with June at
71.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .15 cents
higher with May at 77.27 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent lower to
.45 cent higher with June at 48.42 cents a pound; pork bellies were
1.35 cents to 2 cents higher with May at 35.75 cents a pound.

   A study concluding that changes in procurement
and tax policy hurt the defense industry's profits was based on
erroneous assumptions, a congressional investigative agency said
Wednesday.
   The General Accounting Office found that the conclusions reached
by the MAC Group, a Boston-based consulting firm that reviewed the
financial effects of policy changes implemented from 1984 to 1987,
``cannot be validated for the defense industry as a whole.''
   In its 1988 study, the MAC Group analyzed data on one weapon
program considered representative of nine anonymous defense
contractors. The study concluded that the changes would result in a
23 percent reduction in profits for defense contractors, additional
financing requirements of $8.5 billion for the nine contractors,
and a smaller return on their investment than is necessary to
preserve shareholder value.
   The study was funded by the Aerospace Industries Association of
America, the Electronic Industries Association and the National
Security Industrial Association, whose members include defense
contractors.
   The GAO investigationy, requested by Rep. Charles E. Bennett,
D-Fla., found that available public data and policy changes made
after the study, if projected to the entire defense industry, did
not support the MAC Group's conclusions.
   ``The MAC study seeks to show the impact of policy actions, but
it did not ascertain the industrywide level of profitability of
contractors either before or after these policy changes,'' the GAO
said.
   Bennett said in a statement that the GAO study shows that
``defense contractors have been talking poor but not showing us how
much profits are in their pockets.''
   ``Last year, the big defense companies hired some experts to
prove that defense contractors were hurting. Now we know that their
experts didn't prove anything,'' he said.
   Bennett, the second ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services
Committee, sponsored an amendment last year on profit issues that
was partly included in the fiscal 1989 Defense Authorization Bill.
   Under the law, a group of defense industry representatives and
federal agencies must by this fall recommend a method by which the
Pentagon measures profitability.

<TEXT>
   The Air Force is reviewing a recommendation
that it cancel a $20.4 million contract for radar warning receivers
for F-16 aircraft because the company obtained confidential
information about its competitor's product, a spokesman said
Wednesday.
   The General Accounting Office, a congressional watchdog agency,
recommended this week that the Air Force terminate its Dec. 20
contract with Loral Systems Manufacturing Co., for 19 advanced
radar warning receivers. The agency cited information from
documents released in the investigation of alleged Pentagon fraud
and corruption in its procurement of weapons.
   Litton Systems Inc., a competitor with Loral for the contract,
had filed a protest after documents from ``Operation Ill Wind''
alleged that William Galvin, a defense consultant, obtained
information on Litton's proposal from Victor Cohen, the deputy for
tactical systems in the office of the assistant secretary of the
Air Force for acquisition.
   The contract awarded $20.4 million to Loral for the 19
receivers, but had options that could lead to the production of 673
additional receivers for a total of $188 million.
   Major Donna Pastor, an Air Force spokeswoman, said the service
is reviewing the GAO decision. ``In the interim, the Air Force has
taken steps to preclude the obligation of any additional funds on
the contract'' beyond the $20.4 million, Pastor said.
   ``We won't exercise any production options,'' until the service
completes its review, she said.
   The Air Force has until January 1990 to decide on whether to go
ahead on one of the production options with Loral, but Pastor said
the service would decide on the GAO recommendation well before that.
   The Air Force can accept the agency's recommendation, ask it to
reconsider the decision or reject it outright. If it rejects the
decision, the service must inform the GAO within 60 days.
   The documents, unsealed Dec. 27, alleged that Galvin, who served
as a consultant for Loral and Litton, obtained information from
Cohen about Litton's proposal and passed it on to Loral.
   ``Whether or not the Air Force official was involved in the
actual release, the record establishes that procurement sensitive
documents in the Air Force's possession concerning Litton's product
were obtained by Loral,'' the GAO said.
   The Air Force argued that even if the allegations are true, it
would be difficult to conclude that Loral took advantage of the
improperly acquired information, according to the GAO.
   No charges have been filed against Galvin or Cohen. Galvin has
been suspended from dealings with the Pentagon while Cohen remains
in his post at the Air Force. However, he is no longer involved in
the awarding of contracts, Pastor said.

<HEAD>Davis Extends Tender Offer for NWA Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Los Angeles-based oil billionaire Marvin
Davis on Wednesday extended his $2.7 billion tender offer for NWA
Inc., the Northwest Airlines parent that has several other possible
suitors.
   Davis' $90-a-share offer, which has been rejected as inadequate
by NWA's board, was to expire at midnight Wednesday. Davis said it
will expire at 6 p.m. May 24, unless extended.
   Under a confidentiality agreement with NWA that gave Davis
access to non-public information about the company, no shares can
be purchased under the tender offer ``unless NWA takes certain
specified actions,'' Davis said in a news release.
   Other possible suitors also have signed the agreement, but Davis
has been the only one to launch a tender offer. NWA has urged
suitors to submit proposals on May 30.
   Only 3,134 shares of NWA's 29.1 million outstanding shares had
been tendered to Davis as of Tuesday, Davis said in the news
release.
   Others interested in the nation's fourth-largest airline have
been Pan Am Corp., the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.,
NWA's machinists' union and a friendly partnership led by Los
Angeles investor Al Checchi. Pan Am is backed by a group that
includes investor Richard Rainwater, the Equitable Life Insurance
Co. and Texas' billionaire Bass family.

   The House Interior Committee on Wednesday
unanimously passed a resolution calling on the Exxon Corp. to pay
all expenses surrounding the oil spill in Alaska.
   The resolution, which now goes to the full House, says that
Exxon and the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. ``have failed to keep
their promises and assurances to the Congress and the American
people'' that they could operate the pipeline in an environmentally
safe way.
   The measure gives Exxon until Sept. 15 to cleanup the mess
created March 24 when the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground and
disgorged 10 million gallons of crude oil into the sound.
   It also says that Exxon ``should devote whatever resources are
necessary
   Coast Guard spokesman Jack O'dell emphasized that it was a
proposal and said his agency wouldn't have any response to Boxer's
comments until Thursday. and pay all expenses required to
compensate affected parties expeditiously.''
   The Coast Guard and Alaska state officials, along with federal
officials and the people who were directly affected by the spill,
are to be the ones to determine whether the cleanup is complete,
the measure says.
   Since the spill, the oil has moved more than 550 miles along the
Alaska coastline, killing thousands of sea otters, migratory birds
and other fish and wildlife.
   The result has been devastating to subsistence lifestyle of the
Alaska natives and to the commercial fishing industry, the
resolution states.
   Exxon has repeatedly taken full responsibility for the oil spill
and has been paying the costs of the cleanup.
   In other action related to oil, Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., on
Wednesday called on the Coast Guard to hold public hearings before
it changes rules about oil tanker traffic zones off the West Coast.
   She said the Coast Guard ``bowed to pressure'' from the Bureau
of Minerals Management, which wants more oil development off the
California coast, by decreasing the proposed distance allowed
between ship traffic lanes and oil rigs.
   In 1982, the Coast Guard had recommended a 5-mile ``free zone''
around rigs for 180 miles of the coast from Ano Nuevo to Santa
Barbara, Calif., Boxer said.
   She said the Coast Guard now is considering two one-mile traffic
lanes separated by a two-mile corridor in which rigs could be built.

   The government should create an insurance
program to cover the millions of people who can't afford private
policies to provide nursing home care, witnesses told a House panel
Wednesday.
   The hearing of the Ways and Means health subcommittee ostensibly
was on a measure by Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., the panel chairman,
to set minimum federal standards for the emerging market in nursing
home insurance policies.
   But the witnesses who supported such a measure said what is
needed even more is a federal plan to guarantee nursing home care
for all Americans, regardless of their income.
   That proposition has wide sentimental support in Congress, but
few members are willing to step forward with a concrete to way
raise the estimated $40 billion a year such a program would cost.
   Custodial nursing home coverage was left out of the catastrophic
illness act that took effect Jan. 1.
   Stark, a major architect of the catastrophic coverage bill,
introduced nursing home legislation with a $40 billion price tag
last year, but it went nowhere.
   Testifying in support of Stark's private regulation bill,
Gwendolyn M. Bedford, a board member of the 30-million-member
American Association of Retired Persons, said ``AARP strongly
supports federal minimum standards for long-term care insurance.''
   But she went on to add: ``We believe that it is essential for
the federal government to play a much stronger role in financing
long-term care. ... there is a need for a comprehensive public
long-term care program based on the principles of social insurance
and shared risk.''
   That position was echoed by Gail Shearer, manager of policy
analysis for Consumers Union, which last year published in its
advertising-free magazine, ``Consumer Reports'' a survey of 53
private long-term care policies and found most ``very expensive,
severely limited in their coverage, or both.''
   ``We note that we prefer either a social insurance long-term
care program or government-administered optional long-term care
insurance,'' Ms. Shearer told the panel.
   While supporting regulation in the short term, she told Stark
that Consumers Union wants to work with him on legislation to
``address the larger long-term care problem: extending care to low
and moderate income Americans.''
   Ms. Bedford, of Phoenix, Ariz., went outside her prepared
testimony under questioning from Stark to explain in personal terms
why AARP's support for private insurance regulation is only a
stopgap position.
   ``I'm two years away from 80,'' she said. ``I cannot possibly
afford this (private coverage) in any way, shape form or fashion.
There is no way.''

<HEAD>Fuel Economy Standard to Rise for 1990 Passenger Cars, Skinnner Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. automakers will have to improve fuel economy
to 27.5 miles per gallon on 1990 passenger models, Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner said Wednesday.
   ``I'm hopeful this will be an incentive to (auto makers) to
explore better ways to develop better engines and get better
mileage,'' Skinner said at a news conference after a speech to the
Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry.
   ``We've got to get beyond where we are today, in miles per
gallon, if we're going to deal with this energy crisis.'' He said
the United States is importing more than 8 million barrels of oil a
day for the first time since the 1970s.
   The new standard will be 1 mile per gallon more efficient than
the current 26.5 mile-per-gallon level for 1989 models set by the
Department of Transportation, and 1.5 miles per gallon higher than
the standard in the three previous model years, the department said
in a news release.
   It was 1975 when Congress passed the Energy Policy and
Conservation Act, giving the Transportation Department authority to
set the ``corporate average fuel economy'' standard for passenger
cars sold in the United States.
   The standard, known as the CAFE, is the average fuel economy
measured over the automakers' entire fleets.
   ``Although the standard is tough, Ford will comply,'' said
Donald R. Buist, a spokesman for Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn, Mich.
``For the longer term, alternative ways of measuring fuel-economy
progress should be considered.''
   William Noack, a spokesman for General Motors Corp. in
Washington D.C., said CAFE is a ``misguided regulatory program that
doesn't save energy but does endanger U.S. jobs'' by restricting
the number of family-size American-made cars manufacturers can
produce.
   ``We will, of course, do all we can do to meet the requirements
... even though it is hard to understand why there is such a law
that is harmful to U.S. full-line manufacturers and therefore to
U.S. jobs.''
   Noack said CAFE makes larger cars less available, giving
consumers one of three options: keep their less fuel-efficient
cars; buy trucks or vans _ also less fuel efficient but not covered
by CAFE; or buy larger cars made by foreign manufacturers.
   Though foreign-made cars sold in the United States are governed
by the CAFE standard, most foreign manufacturers have accrued
credits under the program by marketing highly fuel-efficient cars
in past years and can now sell bigger cars without penalty, he said.
   Ben Dunn, a spokesman with Chrysler Motors in Highland Park,
Mich., said ``Chrysler did not take a position on the petition to
roll back the 1990 CAFE standards,'' because the company has always
met the standard. Chrysler sells a larger proportion of small cars
and has higher fuel economy when averaged over its fleet.
   If automakers fail to comply with the CAFE standard, they would
``incur hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in fines, so
the statute enforces itself,'' Skinner said.
   The secretary, who was in Chicago as part of National
Transportation Week observances, said he could not estimate how
much of a saving in fuel the new standard would produce nationally.
   Bob Marx, a spokesman at Skinner's office in Washington, said
the figures were not immediately available.

   Customs agents smashed a ring that smuggled a
``phenomenal amount'' of high-tech equipment to Soviet bloc
countries, but a Belgian believed to be the ringleader remained at
large, officials said Wednesday.
   Four people were arrested Tuesday in Texas on conspiracy and
export law violations, and $1.8 million worth of sensitive computer
equipment was seized in Colorado as it was being readied for
export, said Customs Service spokesman Michael Sheehan.
   The name of the Belgian, who is believed to be living in Europe,
was not disclosed. An arrest warrant also was issued for Warren
Wetstein of Toronto.
   The ring arranged computer shipments from the United States
through European countries for delivery to Bulgaria, ``typically
the procuring agent on behalf of the whole Soviet bloc,'' said
Keith Prager, head of the investigative team code-named ``Miami
Exodus Group.''
   Customs' undercover investigation began 13 months ago, and has
received information on the export of tens of millions of dollars
worth of computer equipment by the ring in the past three or four
years, Sheehan said.
   ``This network of smugglers has been involved in a phenomenal
amount of high-technology smuggling,'' he said. ``This particular
network has been a main supplier, an enormous supplier of high-tech
equipment to Eastern bloc countries.''
   In addition to Romania and Hungary, the network made shipments
to or through Libya, Iran, Iraq, Yugoslavia, Austria and Belgium,
he said.
   The equipment seized from a Colorado Springs, Colo., warehouse
consisted of two Digital Equipment Corp. VAX 8820 computer systems
owned by Pioneer Standard Electronics of Cleveland, Prager said.
   The systems have numerous military and civilian applications, he
said.
   ``It can do virtually anything. It can run anything from a
traffic system in a city to radar to all kinds of military
applications,'' he said.
   The machines were to have been taken to Houston for shipment to
Europe, then to Turkey and finally Bulgaria, Prager said. The final
destination and intended use were not known.
   Customs began its undercover investigation 13 months ago, and
has received information on the export of tens of millions of
dollars worth of computer equipment in the past three or four
years, Sheehan said.
   The Soviet Union and other communist countries have sought
Western computer gear rather than develop their own, he said.
   ``They're willing to pay two, three, four, 10 times as much as
the technology is worth simply because it will save them 100 times
that amount in research and development,'' the spokesman said.
   Steve Smylie and his wife, Carole, who were arrested in Houston,
are accused of acting as brokers and consultants in the ring
through their firm, Technologies International Consultants, Prager
said. The company has no Houston telephone number.
   Jerry Blalock, also arrested in Houston, worked for Pioneer,
Prager said. Company chairman Pete Heller acknowledged Blalock was
an employee, but would not comment otherwise.
   Rick Parish, an employee of Global Computer Corp. of Dallas, was
arrested in Dallas, Prager said. Company president Ron Johnson was
out of the office Wednesday afternoon.
   Wetstein, a broker with Assets Conversion Specialists of
Toronto, was being sought in Canada, and extradition will be
pursued if he is captured, Sheehan said.
   The case will be presented to a federal grand jury in Miami next
week.
   Prager said the ring's members weren't working directly for the
Soviets.
   ``They're profiteers,'' he said. ``They're out to make money.''

<HEAD>US to Lift Curb on Exports Worth $20 Billion</HEAD>

   Security curbs will be lifted soon on
purchases by this country's allies of U.S. goods worth about $20
billion a year, a Commerce Department official said Wednesday.
   The object of the licensing is to prevent strategic items from
falling into the hands of the Soviets or terrorist groups.
   James M. LeMunyon, deputy assistant secretary for export
administration, said some of the allies are considering lifting
similar restrictions on trade among them. He reported that
representatives of several governments recently told him they
wanted to follow the U.S. lead, although he declined to name the
countries.
   LeMunyon was referring to goods traded among the 16 member
countries of the Coordinating Committee on Export Controls, a
publicity-shy body known as Cocom headquartered in Paris. It
includes Japan and all the countries in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization except Iceland.
   LeMunyon said last year the United States required 96,000
licenses for exports to these countries of goods worth about $100
billion. A new regulation will cut down the kinds of technology for
which licenses are required.
   ``About 20,000 licenses will be eliminated by this one
regulation,'' he said.
   LeMunyon would not give a precise date for when the new
regulation will go into effect, but said that in order to get it
out sooner, he was delaying consideration of one provision that
would eliminate additional licenses.
   LeMunyon spoke at a meeting called by the Aspen Institute, a
private policy study group, held in a committee room of the House
of Representatives.
   Among the speakers urging relaxation of export restrictions was
Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn, the new chairman of the subcommittee on
international economic policy of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   ``We have a real opportunity for a change in export controls,''
he said.
   Gejdenson suggested that since the Soviets have withdrawn their
forces from Afghanistan, it's time to lift the restrictions former
President Carter imposed on exports to the Soviet Union when its
troops marched into that country nearly 10 years ago.
   Gejdenson predicted that President Bush will take a more
personal interest in export controls than did former President
Reagan, and said that would lessen what he called the ``lopsided
control'' by the Defense Department. Under Reagan, the Departments
of Defense and Commerce frequently clashed on what exports should
or should not be exported to the allies.
   One major change under the Bush administration has been the
departure of Richard Perle, an assistant secretary of Defense who
is a strong advocate of limiting shipments.
   Mitchell B. Wallerstein of the National Research Council, an
official government advisory body, said in 180 instances either
Reagan or a top aide had to make a decision on issuing a license.
That was no way to run a railroad, he commented.
   Harlan Cleveland, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, presented a
report urging further paring of which items need a license for
shipment to Cocom members. The object is to focus attention on
items considered most important to deny to the Soviets.
   ``We need higher fences around fewer products,'' he said.

<HEAD>FDA Chemist Pleads Guilty In Generic Drug Scam Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former U.S. Food and Drug Administration
chemist snared in the government's investigation of FDA corruption
pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal charges he accepted $9,600 in
bribes from drug companies.
   David J. Brancato, 38, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to
three counts of accepting bribes between 1986 and 1988 from
officials with two drug companies that had products up for review
by the FDA.
   The 38-year-old Rockville man faces up to six years in prison
and $750,000 in fines.
   Gary P. Jordan, first assistant U.S. attorney for Maryland, told
Judge John R. Hargrove that Brancato ``had a reputation in the
generic drug industry for being a fast and efficient reviewer of
applications.''
   ``Several drug manufacturers had expressed an interest in having
him review their applications,'' Jordan said.
   The investigation, which is continuing, has not turned up any
evidence that bad drugs reached the public, Jordan said.
   The first guilty plea in the probe of the FDA's Divison of
Generic Drugs in Rockville came Monday, when Denver drug company
execuitve Raj Maktari, 48, admitted paying a $2,000 bribe to former
FDA supervisor Charles Y. Chang.
   Maktari, vice president for regulatory affairs and product
development for Pharmaceutical Basics Inc., faces up to two years
in prison and a $250,000 fine on the charge.
   Chang, who supervised chemists' reviews of generic drug
applications, has been charged with receiving gratuities from drug
companies.
   According to evidence presented to Hargrove, Maktari gave Chang
$2,000 in cash in August 1987 after Chang said he was having
financial difficulties.
   At the time, Chang and his chemists were reviewing several
applications for new drugs from Maktari's company.
   Chang has also been accused of receiving a free trip to Hong
Kong and thousands of dollars in furniture from a drug company in
New York.
   The investigation began last summer after a U.S. House
subcommittee turned up allegations of corruption involving
government employees, consultants and drug company executives.
   Brancato, Chang and Maktari are cooperating with investigators,
prosecutors said.
   Sentencing dates were not announced.

   Northrop Corp. will cut up to 3,000 jobs or
about 7 percent of its workforce by year's end, the maker of the
B-2 stealth bomber disclosed Wednesday.
   The aerospace company is restructuring its corporate staff and
reducing support staff as its research and development projects
move into production, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas
V. Jones told shareholders at the company's annual meeting.
   ``We expect to be able to decrease our overall employment
requirements by 6 to 7 percent, or about 2,500 to 3,000 positions
between now and the end of the year,'' he said.
   Jones did not say whether the jobs would be cut through layoffs
or attrition. A call to Northrop's office here after hours went
unanswered Wednesday.
   Jones also expressed satisfaction with Northrop's commitment to
build 132 B-2 bombers for the military.
   Revenue generated from the B-2 stealth bomber amounted to $657
million, or about half the company's overall sales for the first
quarter, according to a letter to shareholders.
   The disclosure marked the first time the firm has revealed how
much it has made from the bomber. The sales figure was almost
exactly what most analysts had been estimating since Northrop began
the B-2 program in 1981.
   In the first quarter, the company reported profits of $9.7
million on sales of $1.28 billion, with profits of $9.7 million,
down sharply from a year ago when profits totaled $139.6 million on
sales of $1.37 billion.
   Northrop failed to disclose stealth sales figures for the first
quarter of last year, saying that information remained classified
by the Air Force.
   But Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst at UBS Securities, said that
sales on the bomber appear to be declining.
