   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ Larry and Leona Cottam are trying to
resume a normal life while they fight their murder convictions in
the starvation death of their teen-age son nearly a year ago, the
couple's attorney said.
   ``Under the circumstances, they're doing quite well,'' said Al
Flora Jr., Luzerne County first assistant public defender, of Larry
and Leona Cottam. ``I don't know that they'll ever come back to
normal given what they've been through.''
   Free on bail, the Cottams have found a permanent home since
their third-degree murder convictions Sept. 8, and Larry has taken
a job as a laborer, Flora said.
   The couple recently sold the modest home where their 14-year-old
son, Eric, died in an upstairs bedroom last January, his 5-foot,
10-inch frame wasted to only 69 pounds.
   Eric's death ended the reclusive family's six-week fast,
undertaken despite nearly $4,000 in savings kept as a religious
tithe to God and in hopes God would rescue them from their plight.
   Cottam, a former Seventh-day Adventist pastor, reported his
son's death to police Jan. 4.
   Larry and Leona Cottam were charged with third-degree murder a
day later, while they were still undergoing treatment for
malnutrition at Mercy Hospital in Wilkes-Barre.
   District Justice Ronald Swank read the charges to Mrs. Cottam as
she lay in her hospital bed and to her husband in a hospital
visiting room as he sat in a wheelchair with an intravenous tube in
his arm.
   Laura Cottam, the couple's other child, also received treatment
for malnutrition and later was placed in foster care.
   The Cottams' financial problems began in March 1988 when Cottam
lost his job as a truck driver in a dispute with his boss over the
safety of the vehicle's tires.
   Cottam then refused to sign up for government assistance, and
neighbors said the family declined offers for help and withdrew
into their home on a dead-end street in Nuangola, a community of
700 residents south of Wilkes-Barre.
   Already, the Cottams were teaching their children at home and
had stopped attending church.
   In a seven-week trial, Luzerne County prosecutors claimed Larry
and Leona Cottam should have taken steps other than prayer to
prevent Eric's death and Laura's malnourishment.
   A jury deliberated less than two hours before finding the
Cottams guilty Sept. 8 of third-degree murder and other charges.
Third-degree murder, defined as a killing that is not premeditated
but is done with malice, carries a maximum sentence of 20 years.
   Judge Gifford S. Cappellini allowed Larry Cottam, now 40, and
Leona Cottam, 38, remain free on $50,000 bail each, which was
posted by a bail bondsman. Under the conditions of the bail, one of
their attorneys must see the couple once a week to ensure their
health.
   ``They're keeping their spirits up under the circumstances,''
Flora said. ``Their religious beliefs are still very firm. Would
they ever get into a situation like that again? I don't think so.''
   Mrs. Cottam has had a harder time than her husband, Flora said,
because she does not have a job and stays at home most of the time.
   Laura Cottam, who turned 13 last month, has entered school with
the support of her parents, who even sold Christmas cookies to
raise money for the school, Flora said.
   Flora and co-counsel Joseph Cosgrove claim the Cottams were
denied a fair trial in part because the couple were not allowed to
raise their children's right to freedom of religion.
   At the trial, Laura Cottam testified that her parents didn't
force her to take part in the fast. She said she had used her own
tithe money on food if she wanted.
   Flora and Cosgrove have filed post-trial motions seeking either
a new trial or dismissal of the charges.
   Flora said these motions will be supplemented when the 3,000- to
4,000-page court transcript is completed by the end of January or
early February. A decision by Cappellini on the post-trial motions
isn't expected until summer, he said.
   If the motions are denied, the Cottams have 30 days to file an
appeal the case to state Superior Court.
   ``It's a long process,'' Flora said.

   A fugitive convicted as a leader of a
cocaine-smuggling operation was flown to the United States today
after the Colombian government turned him over to American
authorities, the U.S. Marshals Service said.
   Victor Eduardo Mera-Mosquera, 36, is the 11th person extradited
from Colombia since that country began its crackdown against drug
traffickers in August, U.S. Marshals Service Director K. Michael
Moore said in a statement.
   Mera-Mosquera, a native of Colombia, fled the United States in
1984, just before the trial in New York where he was found guilty
of numerous cocaine offenses, said the statement.
   The fugitive was arrested by Colombian police in the city of
Cali on Oct. 13 and turned over Saturday night to U.S. Marshals,
who flew him back to New York City early today. He was being held
at an undisclosed location pending a court hearing to set a date
for his sentencing, the Marshals Service said.
   According to the Marshals Service, Mera-Mosquera fled the United
States as he was awaiting trial in Feb. 1984 when he was freed from
custody in the mistaken belief that he had been ordered released.
   While still a fugitive, Mera-Mosquera was convicted in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan along with 10 other people of the drug
charges. The indictment charged that he was one of two leaders of
an organization that dealt in ``massive quantities of cocaine,''
the Marshals Service said.
   The Marshals Service carries out the extraditions of persons in
foreign nations who are charged with violating federal laws in the
United States.

   A moderate earthquake shook western Washington
state early Sunday. No damage or injuries were reported.
   The quake, measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale, struck at about
12:46 a.m. PST (3:46 a.m. EST), said Bill Schmeider of the U.S.
Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. He said the epicenter was
located about 40 miles south of Tacoma, Wash.
   People from the Canadian border to Portland, Ore., reported
feeling the tremor. Les Leland of KQEU radio in Olympia said the
shaking lasted about four seconds.
   A resident of Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood said the quake
set off all the car alarms in his apartment complex.
   ``It was like being on a waterbed,'' said Doug Akizuki, who was
on the floor watching television in his apartment.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, and 5
considerable damage.

   Associated Press Correspondent John
Daniszewski was shot and wounded by a group of uniformed men who
stopped his car and was in satisfactory condition in a Timisoara
hospital Sunday, the Yugoslav Consulate said.
   The consulate, in a telephone call to the AP's Belgrade bureau,
said Daniszewski's wounds were not life-threatening. One bullet
entered his arm above the elbow before exiting at his shoulder, and
two more grazed his head, said the consulate, adding that he was at
Judecian hospital in Timisoara.
   Daniszewski, a correspondent based in Warsaw, Poland, was in the
Romanian city about 30 miles east of the Yugoslav border to cover
the revolution in Romania.
   The consulate said it was informed about the shooting and
Daniszewski's condition by Ljuba Pajic, a Yugoslav journalist
working for the Politika Expres newspaper, who was with him in the
car.
   The two were ordered stopped Saturday night by a group of men in
uniform _ either soldiers or men belonging to deposed President
Nicolae Ceauescu's special police, which is resisting
revolutionaries backed by the army.
   As Daniszewski was braking, the group fired at the car, said
Pajic, who was unhurt. They subsequently robbed the two of their
belongings.
   Daniszewski was driven to hospital by a carload of Yugoslav
journalists.

   Buildings burned out of control and
bodies littered the capital Sunday as citizens and allied soldiers
fought savage battles with secret police units loyal to deposed
President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Some of Europe's most brutal street fighting since World War II
continued for a third day in Bucharest and at least four other
major cities nationwide.
   Romanian radio, in the hands of the revolutionaries, called a
cease-fire, but heavy fighting continued in the center of the city
and at the airport. Revenge-minded vigilante groups who plucked
weapons off the dead were adding a new element to the carnage.
   Supporters of Ceausescu penetrated the headquarters of Romania's
revolutionary leaders, shooting and stabbing at random before they
were subdued by armed forces.
   The National Salvation Committee is trying to lead the chaotic
country from inside the television station building, and the army
said the building remained secure after the attack, which
reportedly killed three people.
   Heavily armed secret police forces loyal to the ousted ruler
were fighting fierce battles with army units who joined the popular
uprising on Friday after a week of protests nationwide.
   Fighting eased briefly in the capital after daybreak Sunday, and
some citizens were seen lugging Christmas trees and carrying
shopping bags, as some merchants briefly opened their shops. But
renewed sniping and hit-and-run attacks by Ceausescu loyalists
cleared the streets again.
   Romanian radio said Sunday that soldiers had found a vast
network of safe houses and secret tunnels criss-crossing the city
that Ceausescu forces stocked with arms, ammunition and electronic
monitoring equipment in recent years.
   The tunnels, some with entrances masked by nondescript panels in
subway stations, run for miles, linking Ceausescu's palace with
party headquarters and extending as far as a lake in the northern
part of the city, said the radio.
   The provisional government said Saturday that Ceausescu his
wife, Elena, and other members of the ruling family were captured
by the army.
   Soviet state television said without elaboration Sunday that
Ceausescu and his wife were captured Saturday while hiding in an
underground bunker. Romanian radio said later Sunday that
Ceausescu's daughter, Zoia, also was captured.
   The revolutionary coalition, trying to halt the anarchy in the
streets and disarm civilians as well as Ceausescu loyalists,
ordered a cease-fire and told all non-army personnel to turn in
their weapons by Monday at 5 p.m. local time.
   People violating the cease-fire ``are committing crimes against
the Romanian people and will receive the strictest punishment,''
said the National Salvation Committee decree.
   Fighting was heavy through the night in and around Bucharest and
in the cities of Brasov, Szeben, Sibiu and Timisoara.
   The revolution began Dec. 15 with protests in Timisoara.
Thousands of people were killed when Ceausescu tried to staunch the
massive protests, and hundreds, perhaps thousands more have died in
the armed struggles for control since Ceausescu fled his palace on
Friday.
   Ceausescu's security forces are elite, heavily armed police who
are essentially fighting for their lives against the
revolutionaries, many of whom have vowed revenge for the massacres
of unarmed citizens during the massive pro-reform protests.
   The East Germany news agency ADN said 5,000 people have died in
the fighting Friday and Saturday. That could not be confirmed, but
a head count at one of 14 Bucharest hospital's tallied 100 dead.
   Army units have formed a cordon around the television building,
a focal point of the struggle for the country and headquarters of
the newly formed National Salvation Committee. The committee is a
hastily formed provisional government of officials ousted by
Ceaucescu through the years, dissidents and sympathetic army
officers.
   During the night, witness said that at one point fanatic
Ceausescu supporters appeared in the TV building's corridors,
shooting and stabbing randomly before being subdued.
   People at the TV building said nobody knew where the attackers,
dressed in civilian clothes, had come from. It was unclear whether
they had penetrated army defenses from the outside or if they had
been in hiding within.
   The assault left one woman dead and two men wounded.
   The U.S. Embassy in Bucharest on Sunday was evacuating
dependents and some staff in a convoy to Sofia, said spokeswoman
Agi Kuperman.
   The army claimed control of all major strategic points across
the nation on Romanian radio. But it was difficult to tell how
secure was the revolutionaries' hold on the country.
   In Timisoara, Associated Press correspondent John Daniszewski
was shot and wounded by uniformed men who stopped his car and
robbed him Saturday night, the Yugoslav Consulate said. He was
hospitalized in satisfactory condition. It could not immediately be
determined whom his assailants were.
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said fighting had moved to the
outskirts of Timisoara, with army units apparently engaging fleeing
Ceausescu loyalists.
   Youths armed with clubs or iron bars assumed control in the city
and were directing traffic and performing other routine functions,
said Tanjug.
   Romanian radio also reported fighting in Sibiu and Brasov, both
about 60 miles north of Bucharest.
   In Bucharest, sporadic machine gun and sniper fire could be
heard near the downtown Intercontinental Hotel, and at least two
snipers were believed positioned on the hotel's roof, from where
fire could be heard before noon.
   Firefights raged well into Saturday night in Bucharest, with the
routes once traveled by Ceausescu between his guarded private villa
and the Communist Party headquarters the scene of intense battles.
   The university library and nearby buildings, believed to be the
stronghold of the Ceausescu loyalist forces, were burning out of
control on Sunday, and there were no attempts to put out the fires.
   Groups of teen-agers armed with automatic rifles and pistols
which they took from the dead ``are trying to carry out a vendetta
against the (Securitate) terrorists,'' Stephan Andreescu, spokesman
for the National Salvation Committee, said, referring to the
security forces.
   ``These ... forces are trying to escape and are extremely
dangerous,'' Andreescu told The Associated Press. But he claimed
the army was in ``complete control of the situation in the
country.''
   ``The terrorists are believed to be hiding in the subway and in
secret underground passages below the former presidential palace,''
Andreescu said. ``It will take days before it is all over.''
   The Soviet news agency Tass, reporting from Bucharest, said the
resisting Securitate units were retreating to cemeteries where
there are rumored to be ``hideouts among burial vaults and
entrances to a system of secret underground tunnels.''
   Ceausescu ruled Romania with an iron fist for 24 years, refusing
the Soviet bloc reforms that this year swept through Hungary,
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and East Germany with relatively
little violence.
   In Switzerland, the Justice Minister said Sunday that a
``precautionary'' freeze has been placed on any assets that may be
held in Switzerland by Ceausescu and his family. The action came
after Romanian exile groups claimed the ousted dictator had stashed
millions of dollars of gold in Zurich banks.
   Thousands of people have been killed since Dec. 15, when the
defense by a few hundred people of a defiant pastor threatened with
arrest in Timisoara turned into a mass protests that swirled the
nation.
   Ion Iliescu, a leading figure in the National Salvation
Committee, said in a national broadcast early Saturday evening that
Ceausescu would be tried.
   A committee communique Sunday said courts would mete out
punishments of the ``greatest severity'' to ``the dictator and his
former lackeys.''
   Several aid shipments sent from abroad were said by Hungarian,
Austrian and other media to be tied up at the airport.

<TEXT>
   A military leader charged with drug
smuggling with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega pledged loyalty to the
new government and said he will submit to U.S. military authority,
officials said Sunday.
   Col. Luis del Cid, commander of the 5th Military Zone, held a
news conference Saturday in the western city of David to make his
announcement. Details of the development did not reach the capital
until Sunday.
   U.S. airplanes and helicopters flew observation patrols over the
capital Sunday. No airborne fire or bombing was heard, but gunfire,
heavy at times, crackled in some streets in the working-class
neighborhood of San Miguelitos.
   The U.S.-installed civilian government of President Guillermo
Endara began forming a security force to quell looting and
lawlessness in the streets.
   About 2,000 U.S. troop reinforcements, including a helicopter
company, were sent Saturday, the fourth day of the largest U.S.
combat operation since the Vietnam War, boosting the U.S. troop
strength in the country to 26,000.
   Noriega, the object of a massive U.S. search, remained at large.
   The number of U.S. servicemen killed in the five days of
fighting rose to 25. Two American dependents also have been killed,
241 troops wounded and one was missing. The U.S. military said 139
Panamanian soldiers have died and 95 have been wounded. At least
260 Panamanian civilians have been killed, according to Dr. Elmer
Miranda, director of Santo Tomas Hospital.
   The U.S. Southern Command said 2,250 people have been detained.
   Del Cid, long one of Noriega's principal associates, said
concern for the security of his 10 children weighed heavily in his
decision not to resist the U.S. invasion and occupation force.
   U.S. troops had not reached David, 210 miles west of Panama
City, by early Sunday. The commander ordered David's airfield blown
up Wednesday to prevent the landing of American aircraft.
   Noriega, Del Cid and 14 others were indicted on drug charges in
U.S. federal court in Miami in February 1988.
   Del Cid told reporters his officers should be considered during
formation of a Panamanian military force to replace the routed
Defense Forces of Noriega.
   He also presided over the public surrender of arms by more than
100 members of local ``Dignity Battalions,'' paramilitary units
loyal to Noriega.
   U.S. military authorities were unavailable for comment early
Sunday as to whether Del Cid would be arrested and flown to Florida
for trial.
   Noriega's Dignity Battalions have surprised the U.S. military
with their strength and endurance. Joined by an unknown number of
soldiers and officers from the 15,000-member Defense Forces, they
turned to guerrilla warfare.
   The battalions are ``increasing their activities of harassing
attacks with small arms and mortar fire, threatening the civilian
population and hostage-taking,'' Lt. Col. Jerry Marguila, spokesman
for the U.S. Southern Command, said.
   Earlier, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the Southern Command chief, said
the battalions are believed to have about 1,800 members and to be
operating in groups of about a dozen.
   An Air Force plane repeatedly bombed a hilltop position of
loyalists Saturday in San Miguelito, and dozens of troops then
descended on the district. Residents said eight houses were
destroyed in the bombing, aimed at a house that reportedly stocked
weapons for Noriega supporters.
   Endara, sworn in as president Wednesday at the start of the
invasion, said he did not agree with the intervention but could
work with the Americans.
   The invasion was ``like a kick in the head,'' he said in an
interview. ``It was not the best thing I would have thought.''
   ``We were not really consulted,'' said Endara. He said he was
told of the plans two or three hours before the first attacks were
launched.
   ``I would have been happier without an intervention,'' he said.
Plans for maintaining public order should have been laid in
advance, he said.
   Panama City is a busy duty-free commercial center jammed with
stores that before the political crisis did a booming business in
imported electronic equipment, cameras, watches, clothes, cloth and
other merchandise.
   Looters began ransacking its well-stocked supermarkts and other
stores hours after the invasion began and by Saturday hadn't
stopped.
   Citizens took the law into their own hands, forming patrols and
building barricades to protect their homes.
   Twenty members of the new public safety force were sworn in
Friday, and more were to be sworn in over the weekend, Endara said.
All the members, including the force commander, Col. Roberto
Armijo, had been members of the Noriega-run police force, which was
part of the Defense Forces.
   ``They swore allegiance to a new president, a new constitution
and democracy,'' Endara said.
   Parts of the city of 1 million were in ruins from the U.S.
bombing and debris from the looting littered the streets.
   Supplies of food and medicine were dwindling.
   ``We are trying to open the airport and trying to open the
Bridge of the Americas so we can bring in medicine and food,''
Endara said. The bridge is the main crossing over the Panama Canal,
which divides the country in two.
   On Saturday, Noriega supporters released Jon Meyersohn, a CBS
News producer seized Wednesday at the Marriott Hotel, and Doug
Mullen, an executive with GTE who was taken along with Meyersohn.

   Ernest Dutch Morial, New Orleans's first
black mayor, died early Sunday, apparently of a heart attack. He
was 60.
   Morial was found slumped over the steering wheel of his car on
Lakeshore Parkway, where he had been visiting a friend, at 11 p.m.
Saturday, said Jinx Broussard, a spokeswoman for Mayor Sidney
Barthelemy.
   Morial was taken to Mercy Hospital where efforts to revive him
failed, Broussard said.
   Morial was mayor of New Orleans for two terms from 1978-1986.
   He not only was the city's first black mayor, but from 1967-1970
he was the first black to serve in the state Legislature since
Reconstruction. Prior to that he was a U.S. attorney. From
1973-1977, he was a judge on the Louisiana 4th Circuit Court of
Appeals.

   The losers in a medical malpractice
trial claim in a request for a new trial that an episode of the TV
series ``L.A. Law'' influenced the jurors to vote against them.
   In a motion filed Friday, a lawyer representing a man whose wife
died after a 1981 gallbladder operation suggested jurors were
influenced by the Dec. 7 episode, which portrayed a doctor
wrongfully accused of malpractice.
   The jury in the case of widower Jacob Klein vs. Drs. Harvey O.
Kaiser and Theodore D. Aylward decided on Dec. 8 that the doctors
were not at fault in the death of Lillian Klein.
   ``The show was pure and simple propaganda for doctors defending
malpractice cases,'' said the motion filed on Klein's behalf by
Miami lawyer David F. Ennis.
   ``In effect, the defendant(s) had substantial additional time
for argument made through trained, sympathetic, well-liked,
well-known actors,'' the motion said.
   ``It is highly probable, and more likely than not, in light of
`L.A. Law's' nationwide popularity, that one or more jurors viewed
this segment ... or even discussed same among them,'' Ennis
concluded.
   Tampa lawyer William Hahn, who defended Aylward, said he thought
the motion was humorous.
   Three members of the jury reached Friday by telephone said the
show had no effect on their verdict, the Tampa Tribune reported
Saturday. All said the show was not mentioned by others during
deliberations.
   ``I started to watch it and I fell asleep,'' said juror
Christine Wallace.
   Pat Schultz, corporate spokeswoman for NBC in Los Angeles, said
company officials know of no court case that had to be retried
because of ``L.A. Law.''

   One Emergency Medical Service ambulance crew
declared a man dead and left, then a second crew was called and
found that the man was breathing.
   The first EMS crew was placed on administrative duty until an
investigation is completed, said EMS spokeswoman Lynn Schulman.
   The city agency got a call Saturday that James Manners, 65, had
suffered cardiac arrest, Schulman said.
   The EMS crew declared him dead and left, and a police officer,
following standard procedure, remained at the scene until a vehicle
from the morgue could pick up the body, she said.
   But Manners' roommate suspected that the man was not dead and
called EMS a second time, police Sgt. Mary Wrensen said.
   A second EMS team was sent. ``The guy was breathing when the
second crew got there,'' Schulman said. They took him to Lincoln
Hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later, she said.

   A malfunctioning state lottery computer
allowed sales for 10 minutes after the winning numbers were drawn
and customers helped themselves to more than 250 winning tickets,
officials said.
   Lottery officials, however, said a backup computer caught the
error and recorded which tickets were sold after the drawing. The
late tickets will not be honored, and officials may prosecute those
who try to collect on them as well as revoke licenses from the
agents who sold them, said state lottery director Otho Brown.
   ``Its the worst problem I've ever had,'' Brown said.
   As much as $600,000 in fraudulent winning tickets may be in
circulation, Brown said. While some were cashed, he predicted the
losses will be limited to between $30,000 and $60,000.
   The tickets were in the ``Play 3'' game, which pays $250 for the
winning numbers in correct order, and ``Play 4,'' which pays $2,500.
   ``Somewhere the system burped and nobody saw it,'' said Finance
Secretary Stephen T. Golding.
   The problem occurred when the computer system's clock
malfunctioned and the computer failed to stop selling for
Thursday's games at 6:56 p.m., two minutes before the drawing.
Sales were allowed to continue for 12 minutes until the problem was
discovered and the computer was shut down manually, officials said.
   Brown said Control Data Corp., which runs the computer system
for the Delaware lottery, has acknowledged its liability.

   Three armed men opened fire on the
U.S. Information Service library in Davao City on Sunday,
shattering windows but causing no injuries, police reported.
   Sgt. Rommel Moya said the gunmen escaped after shooting from a
speeding car about 1:15 p.m. The library was closed at the time,
Moya said.
   There was no indication who was responsible for the shooting.
Communist rebels operate in Davao City, 600 miles southeast of
Manila.
   But government troops have been on alert in the Davao area
because of reports that military mutineers who tried to topple
President Corazon Aquino earlier this month were planning attacks
in the Davao area.
   The mutineers were angered when U.S. warplanes flew air cover
missions to support government forces Dec. 1, the first day of the
failed coup. Although they did not fire, the U.S. jets helped turn
the tide in the battle.
   The military said Saturday that five private shooting clubs
associated with the son of Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, were involved in
the failed coup.
   The Philippine Constabulary said about 100 civilian members of
the clubs were identified through photographs and videotapes as
having fought alongside military mutineers who launched the coup
attempt.
   The shooting clubs are part of the Philippine Tactical Shooting
Association, an umbrella organization headed by Juan ``Jackie''
Ponce Enrile Jr., son of the former defense minister and lone
opposition member of the Senate, the constabulary said.
   The statement did not specifically name the younger Enrile as
among those members taking part in the coup attempt.
   The elder Enrile has denied involvement in the coup attempt,
believed to have been led by a clique of officers associated with
him when he served as Mrs. Aquino's defense chief.
   Enrile was fired in November 1986 after a failed coup by his
followers.

<HEAD>East Germans Welcome West Germans as Visa Restrictions Dropped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of West Germans passed through the
Berlin Wall on Sunday after East Germany marked the holidays by
lifting visa and currency requirements on visitors from the West.
   A spontaneous festival erupted on the East side of the wall's
Brandenburg Gate shortly after midnight as West Berliners poured
through the border crossing.
   The East German government, forced to give in to a pro-democracy
uprising, opened the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9 and lifted most
restrictions on East Germans who want to travel to the West.
   Earlier this month, the government lifted currency exchange and
visa requirements on West Germans traveling to the East, fully
opening the border between the nations.
   The new rules went into effect at midnight Saturday, and there
was no shortage of West Germans curious about the East.
   East Berliners tried to return the warm welcome they had
received in West Berlin in November, when bars and cafes stayed
open all night in a riotous celebration of freedom.
   Six weeks later, smiling East Germans rolled out a large keg of
beer, others passed out cognac in the cold drizzle and still others
served as guides for West Berliners, many of whom had crossed into
East Berlin for the first time.
   They strolled down Unter Den Linden, the most elegant boulevard
in East Berlin.
   Berliners from both sides of the crumbling wall broke out in a
chorus of old songs, and couples twirled around to the steady beat
of an organ grinder winding his way around the Brandenburg Gate.
Merrymakers handed flowers to police who grinned in response.
   Others shook metal cans to collect money for medical supplies
for battle-stricken Romania, while the familiar clink of souvenir
seekers chipping away at the wall continued in the background.
   Until Sunday, West Germans were required to obtain a visa to
travel into East Germany and were obliged to change 25 marks, about
$15, each day, a hefty sum for young people and the elderly.
   Now, West Germans simply must show an identity card and fill out
a short form so that the East Germans are able to keep track of the
number of visitors.
   West German border police reported that East Germans greeted
their West German neighbors with flowers and a welcome drink in
numerous villages along the border even before the new rules became
official.
   At many border crossings, East German border guards simply
ignored the rules and allowed West Germans in before the new
regulations went into effect.
   Still, border police reported Sunday morning that the number of
East Germans heading West outstripped the number of West Germans
using their new travel freedoms in the other direction.
   But the number of East Germans traveling to West Germany had
fallen sharply in comparison with previous Sundays. Border police
attributed the drop to the fact that the stores were closed for
Christmas.

   A man convicted of trying to smuggle
foreign currency was sentenced to death Sunday by a military court.
   Sudan Airways pilot Girgis Butrus, who will be hanged, was
convicted Saturday by the special military tribunal of trying to
smuggle more than $100,000 worth of foreign currency out of Sudan.
   The court said he was guilty of ``subversion of the Sudanese
economy,'' a crime punishable by death under laws in effect since a
military coup overthrew the civilian government June 30.
   The tribunal sentenced Mohamed al-Rashid, a driver at Khartoum
airport, to 10 years in jail after convicting him of helping Butrus.
   Earlier this month, the military government hanged one man
convicted of dealing in the foreign currency black market and
another for selling drugs.
   Two other Sudanese are on death row, one for dealing in the
foreign currency and another for leading a one-week strike by
doctors.
   The United States has strongly condemned the death sentences.

<TEXT>
   Residents of an isolated southern city
gave a jubilant welcome to a convoy of barges that arrived with the
first consumer goods in 10 months, the Sudan News Agency reported
Sunday.
   The barges' military escort repelled an attack by the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army as it snaked along the Nile to reach
Malakal, 425 miles south of the capital, Khartoum.
   The agency did not say when the barges arrived. It said they
carried 45,000 tons of sorghum, sugar, cooking oil and laundry soap.
   The city's 100,000 people have faced severe shortages as a
result of fighting between government troops and southern rebels.
The fighting forced the government to suspend relief flights to the
region, and the last commercial barge to reach the city arrived in
February.
   SUNA said the convoy had an army unit guarding it on board and
another walking alongside it on the shore. It left Khartoum on Dec.
4.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party in Yugoslavia's
liberal state of Slovenia on Sunday pledged its full suppport for
the establishment of Western-style democracy in the country.
   ``We shall strive for the creation of a multiparty system,''
Ciril Ribicic, the party's newly elected leader, told delegates at
a regional party congress.
   Slovenia's Communists under Milan Kucan, the regional party's
outgoing leader, have moved quickly over the past three years to
create a pluralistic political system in the republic.
   This has put it at odds with Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's
six republics, where Communist leaders are opposed to any form of
pluralism.
   Numerous independent political movements and opposition parties,
including the Social Democratic and Christian Democratic parties,
have been established in Slovenia and are preparing to compete in
the region's first free legislative elections scheduled for March.
   ``The decision to implement ... radical reforms makes it
possible for Slovenes to be proud,'' Ribicic said.
   Croatia, Yugoslavia's second-largest republic, has also
announced that free elections will be held next spring.
   Only the leadership of Serbia has remained consistently opposed
to pluralism. Last month, Serbia's central republic broke off all
business and government ties with Slovenia over their political
differences.
   The Slovene party congress, which opened Friday and adopted as
its slogan ``Europe Now,'' voted to disband all party cells in
state enterprises and government institutions and decided that
Kucan should head its list of parliamentary candidates at the
upcoming elections.
   The policy-setting body also denounced repression in Romania and
said a similar problem exists in Serbia's province of Kosovo.
   Ethnic Albanians make up about 85 percent of the population in
the province, and tensions are high there because Serbian leaders
are trying to curb the province's autonomy.
   At least 28 people have died in ethnic violence in Kosovo this
year.

   The unraveling of communism in
Eastern Europe should serve as a warning to Marxist rebels who for
20 years have tried to topple the Philippine government, newspapers
said Sunday.
   The insurgents waging Southeast Asia's last major Marxist
rebellion should consider ``a complete and permanent cessation of
hostilities,'' the Philippine Daily Inquirer said in an editorial.
   ``For its part, Congress should think seriously about legalizing
the Communist Party of the Philippines to give its leaders and
members an opportunity to participate freely and legally in the
politics and government of the country,'' the newspaper added.
   It said the historic changes sweeping the Soviet Union and its
allies had undermined the ideological foundation of Marxism.
   Several major newspapers and a political columnist urged an end
to the insurgency just days before the 21st anniversary of the
creation of the Maoist Communist Party of the Philippines, which
was founded Dec. 26, 1968.
   Columnist Jesus Bigornia, writing in The Manila Bulletin, noted
the bloody overthrow of the 24-year regime of Romanian President
Nicolae Ceausescu, the last Warsaw Pact holdout against reform.
   ``The fate of Ceausescu and his Romanian Communist Party could
serve as a warning to the Philippines,'' Bigornia wrote.
``Possibly, the time has come for the Communist Party of the
Philippines to dissolve its New Peoples Army, lay down their arms
(and) join the mainstream of Philippine society.''
   On Thursday, the rebel National Democratic Front hinted it would
be willing to resume peace talks, which broke off in February 1987.
The Front, an umbrella organization of 12 Marxist groups, declared
a Christmas and New Year's cease-fire but expressed no willingness
for a peaceful settlement of the insurgency.
   ``Let the silence of our guns this Christmas deliver this
message loud and clear,'' the Front said. Similar statements were
issued by the Front during the Christmas seasons of 1987 and 1988.
   ``The (Communist) and government forces have declared unilateral
cease-fires during the holiday season,'' said The Manila Chronicle.
``But come January, it's back to mutual destruction; tough luck for
whomever's in the way.''
   President Corazon Aquino has repeatedly insisted that the
Communists and their estimated 19,000-strong New Peoples Army lay
down their arms before talks can begin.
   The government's hard-line position may reflect a perception
that the rebels do not constitute as great a threat as they
appeared to in the months following the 1986 ouster of President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   In the last three years, the greatest immediate threat to the
Aquino government has come not from the Communists but from
soldiers who have launched six armed coup attempts, most recently
this month.

   Queen Margrethe II of Denmark has
decided to return orders she received from toppled Romanian
President Nicolae Ceausescu, press reports said Sunday.
   Queen Margrethe and the Prince Consort Henrik were decorated
with Romanian orders during Ceausescu's official visit to Denmark
in November 1980, the daily Jyllands-Posten said.
   The queen also canceled the Order of the Knight of the Great
Cross, which she gave to Ceausescu's wife, Elena.
   The former president was erased as Knight of the Elephant Order,
Denmark's most prestigious and highest ranking order, which is
awarded only to members of royal families and heads of state.
   Ceausescu was overthrown Friday in a popular revolt against his
hard-line Communist rule.

<TEXT>
   Romanian tennis star Ilie Nastase says his legs
shook as he watched tanks firing at buildings in Bucharest last
week.
   In a statement published in The Sunday Telegraph, Nastase was
quoted as saying he was ``hoping and praying'' that the people won
their fight against forces loyal to ousted Communist President
Nicolae Ceausescu. He said he left Bucharest on Friday, the same
day Ceausescu fled the presidential palace.
   ``All week the rumors were growing of what was happening. But we
believed Ceausescu was too powerful for the people to succeed,''
Nastase said.
   He said he was aware of ``pressure building up in Romania, but I
didn't think things could happen so quickly.''
   ``On Thursday I had to go to see what was happening. ... I did
not fight but I just wanted to be part of what all these people
were doing. I was shocked. I saw people falling down as soldiers
and police opened fire. Then in the evening they were firing on
them from helicopters.''
   Nastase, 43, who had ``never seen a dead person in my life
before,'' was quoted as saying a tank started firing behind him
and, ``I wasn't a normal person, my legs were shaking, everything
was shaking.''
   At Bucharest Airport on Friday, his flight out was delayed
several hours because it was feared anti-Ceausescu forces might
shoot it down, Nastase was quoted as saying.
   Nastase said his army officer rank was an honorary one, ``given
to me because of my tennis playing. I don't have any links with
them. As for the security police, everybody fears them. That's why
we thought a revolution could never succeed.''
   He said he met Ceausescu only once, ``when he gave me a
decoration a long time ago.'' But he knew Ceausescu's son,
Valentin, who he said ``has nothing to do with his father and has
criticized him in the past.''
   In his tennis-playing heyday in the 1970s, Nastase was famous
for his flamboyant on-court antics and won the 1972 U.S. Open and
the 1973 French Open. He now plays on the seniors tour, an
international circuit for veteran stars.

<TEXT>
   Moslem leaders from around the nation are
meeting in an annual conference on the prophet Mohammed, some
American Buddhists are giving new stature to Bodhi Day, and
lighting Hanukkah candles has become the second most widely
practiced observance among American Jews.
   It must be Christmastime.
   While Christian leaders bemoan the commercialization of
Christmas, other religious groups are reporting revived interest in
their own traditions in reaction to the relentless secular presence
of the holiday.
   ``What that reflects, frankly, is the attempt ... to compensate
for the overwhelming presence of Christmas in American society,''
said Rabbi A. James Rudin, national interreligious affairs director
of the American Jewish Committee.
   Rudin said there has been a ``mismatch'' because the Jewish and
Christian holidays fall near each other but are not equal in
importance.
   ``One is a minor Jewish holiday. One is a major Christian
holiday,'' Rudin said. ``The truth is Christmas is not the
Christian Hanukkah and Hanukkah is not the Jewish Christmas.''
   But that has not stopped Hanukkah, the eight-day Jewish Feast of
Lights that began Friday evening, from becoming an important
tradition in the United States. Surveys showed more than two-thirds
of all Jewish people in the United States light Hanukkah candles, a
ritual surpassed only by attendance at a Passover Seder.
   Among many Buddhists, special emphasis has been placed on the
Dec. 8 celebration of Bodhi Day, the day they believe the Buddha
became enlightened.
   The Rev. Carol Himaka, education director of the Buddhist
Churches of America in San Francisco, said Bodhi Day is being more
widely observed ``because of the need to have our own young people
recognize our own tradition.''
   Still, she said, many Buddhists celebrate Christmas the way a
lot of non-devout Christians mark the holiday _ with trees and
presents and little regard for the religious significance of the
birth of the person Christians believe is the son of God.
   ``It's more difficult to explain to young children, especially,
why they should not celebrate Christmas,'' she said.
   The Bahais, who say Jesus was a prophet sent by God, do not
believe there is a spiritual conflict in observing Christmas,
according to Katharine Bigelow, deputy director of the Bahai
National Office of External Affairs in Washington.
   ``I don't observe Christmas with my Bahai friends, but with my
family who is all Christian, I look forward to celebrating with
them,'' she said.
   Some Moslem leaders attending the Seerah Conference sponsored by
the Council of Masajid of United States over Christmas weekend said
that while Jesus also is a respected figure in their faith, all
trappings of Christmas should be avoided.
   ``We want our children to know about our religion and an Islamic
perspective,'' said Habib Malik, a teacher with the Muslim World
League in Philadelphia.
   ``We are concerned when we see some Moslem families bringing
Christmas trees home.''
   Imam Shamsher Ali, director of the Islamic Religious Center of
Long Island, said Moslem religious leaders emphasize at Friday
prayer sessions before Christmas that their faith teaches Jesus was
a prophet of God, but not the son of God.
   Competition with Christmas is not always a positive thing, other
religious leaders said.
   Rudin remembers being told as a child to be thankful he was
Jewish and receiving gifts for eight days during Hanukkah, while
``those quote `poor Christians' were only going to get gifts for
one day.''
   His advice: ``Let Hanukkah be Hanukkah.''
   Some celebrations this time of year are not tied to any religion.
   Kwanzaa, a holiday modeled on traditional African harvest
celebrations, is observed by some black Americans. It begins
Tuesday and runs through Jan. 1.
   And the Southern California wing of Atheists United exchanged
gifts Thursday afternoon to mark the winter solstice.
   ``Basically, it's a time to party,'' said Atheists United
President Alexander Prairie.

<HEAD>Government Approves Fiscal 1990 Draft Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Sunday approved a draft $466.7
billion budget for fiscal 1990 that for the first time in 15 years
does not rely on deficit-financing bonds.
   The Cabinet held a special meeting to accept the Finance
Ministry's draft budget for the fiscal year beginning in March. The
budget represents a 9.7 percent increase over current spending.
   It calls for increases of 5.5 percent in defense spending, to
$29.1 billion; 5.9 percent in aid to developing countries, to about
$5.6 billion; and 6.2 percent in social security spending, to $81.5
billion.
   The increases reflect growing tax revenues flowing from Japan's
booming economy, which just entered its fourth year of continuous
expansion.
   Further negotiations will fine-tune specific allocations for the
final version of the budget, which is expected to be approved
Friday.
   The Cabinet also approved a supplementary budget for the current
fiscal year. The $41.5 billion budget is the largest stop-gap
budget ever.
   ``The greatest thrust of this year's budget is the desire of the
government to end its dependence on deficit-financing bonds,'' a
Foreign Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Since they were first introduced in 1975, we have made earnest
efforts to end this dependency. We were finally able to rid
ourselves of this unhealthy system.''
   The government issued $9.3 billion worth of deficit-financing
bonds last year to cover the budget's red ink. That amount will be
made up in part by an infusion in fiscal 1990 of $9.15 billion from
government sales last year of its shares in Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp., as well as increased tax revenues, the official
said.
   Defense spending will rise to $29.1 billion, but because of
economic expansion, the defense budget will dip below 1 percent of
Japan's gross national product for the first time in four years,
standing at 0.991 percent of the GNP.
   In the mid-1970s Japan adopted a policy of keeping defense
spending to within 1 percent of the GNP, but since 1986 it has
hovered just above that figure.
   Spending on public works will rise 0.3 percent to $43.8 billion
next fiscal year. Although the United States has urged Japan to
increase such publicly funded projects to help ease Tokyo's trade
surplus with Washington, the marginal increase ``is sufficient,''
the Finance Ministry official said.
   The draft budget was compiled on the basis of government
estimates that the economy will grow an inflation-adjusted 4
percent next year, a brisk pace despite a slowdown from the
estimated 4.6 percent growth in fiscal 1989.
   An unusual addition to the fiscal 1990 budget was $39 million
for the formal enthronement ceremonies of Emperor Akihito, and
$958,000 for the wedding of Akihito's second son, Prince Aya.

<HEAD>After Years Of Protest, South African Beaches Open To All Races</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black and white children helped each
other build sandcastles. Their older brothers played soccer
together. White lifeguards shouted warnings in Zulu.
   After years of debate, protests and occasional violence, South
Africa has opened all its beaches to all races and buried one of
its most visible and resented apartheid practices.
   As recently as August, police used whips and dogs to keep blacks
off segregated sand. But at Durban's hotel-lined beachfront, the
busiest in the country, the attitude Sunday was swim and let swim.
   ``I preferred segregated beaches,'' said Charles Erasmus, a
vacationing white. ``But what am I going to do? Spite myself and
not go swimming? The law's been changed and we'll have to accept
it.''
   President F.W. de Klerk last month declared an end to
whites-only beaches, settling a conflict that arose every December
when hundreds of thousands of South Africans travel to the coast
for vacation.
   For authorities, opening the beaches has proved far easier than
keeping them segregated in the face of mounting black protest.
   Shortly before de Klerk's declaration, the Durban City Council
spent six hours debating whether to open the last remaining
stretches of segregated beach.
   Their solution: remove the embarrassing ``Whites Only'' signs
but keep the law in effect. Days after de Klerk's announcement, the
council voted 24-5 to integrate the beaches.
   Morris Fynn, a mixed-race man who was arrested several times for
cutting down ``Whites Only'' beach signs, ceremoniously buried his
saw in the sand to mark the formal death of beach apartheid.
   Three years ago, Allan Hendrickse, the first mixed-race member
of the Cabinet, invited reporters to watch him take a dip at a
whites-only beach at Port Elizabeth.
   One of his next public acts was to apologize for his swim after
being rebuked by then-President P.W. Botha.
   Anti-apartheid groups targeted beaches along with other
segregated facilities when they launched a nationwide defiance
campaign in August.
   When protesters arrived at a beach near Cape Town, it was
cordoned off and accompanied by signs saying, ``Police Dog Training
In Progress.''
   When the demonstrators proceeded, they were met with tear gas,
whips and police dogs. Several people were injured.
   Local authorites have complied with de Klerk's proclamation,
though under protest in some cases. But there have been no reports
of racial violence, or even serious overcrowding, since the beaches
were opened.
   ``Look, there are thousands of people here and no
confrontations,'' said Walter Buthelezi, 19, who was visiting the
beachfront with his sisters. ``There was never any need for
segregated beaches.''
   But Durban's Mayor Derrick Waterson disagrees.
   ``This wouldn't have happened easily five years ago.
Conservative whites weren't ready for it,'' he said.
   Waterson and his council have received more than 400 complaints
from whites. In the town of Mossel Bay, about 2,500 whites signed a
petition asking for a return to segregated beaches.
   Many whites insist they are not racist and say they want
separate beaches because of ``cultural differences.''
   Some blacks swim in their underwear and strip naked when washing
off under the shower nozzles at the beach, the whites complain.
   ``It's mostly older people that get offended, but when we talk
to the blacks they always cooperate,'' lifeguard Liam Halforty said.
   Halforty and his colleagues have been taking a crash course in
Zulu to help them communicate with black bathers. Roughly 15
percent of the beach crowd was black over the weekend,
traditionally one of the busiest of the year in Durban.
   ``I'm sure some whites stayed away,'' said Carol Cilliers. ``It
will take about two or three years before they will come back to
these beaches.''
   De Klerk has promised to remove all discriminatory laws, and
most so-called ``petty apartheid'' measures already have been
scrapped.
   The major remaining areas of segregation are public schools,
residential areas, and public hospitals. De Klerk has pledged to
keep these separate for whites who want them, and many do.
   ``Beaches are one thing, schools and neighborhoods are
another,'' said Leo Kotze, a vacationer.

<HEAD>Waite's Brother Says Events This Year Raise Hopes For Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brother of Anglican church envoy Terry Waite
said Sunday he is optimistic about the eventual release of his
brother and other hostages in Lebanon because of events this year
in Britain, Iran and the United States.
   David Waite said he was encouraged by the election of a new
Iranian president, the inauguration of a new U.S. president and a
letter he received recently from British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd that outlined an avenue for improved Anglo-Iranian relations.
   ``I felt it was quite an important letter because he was saying
in fact that as long as Iran was ready to use her influence to
secure the release of Terry and the other hostages, Britain would
look to improve their relationships with Iran,'' Waite said in a
British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
   Citing the new administrations of Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani and President Bush as well as Hurd's letter, he said:
``So there has been a lot of change and a lot of hope, I feel, for
the future.''
   Waite, 50, the special envoy of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west Beirut
hotel to negotiate with the Shiite fundamentalist group Islamic
Jihad for the release of two American hostages.
   No group has claimed to hold him, but he is widely believed to
be held by Islamic Jihad.
   Waite is one of 18 foreigners and four Britons missing in
Lebanon. American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press, is the longest-held Western hostage. He
was seized March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Baker: `I Regret' Misleading Statement About China Contacts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Sunday ``I regret'' giving a misleading account of the Bush
administration's contacts with China following the massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   Baker on Dec. 10 said in a televised interview that a trip by
two administration officials to China earlier in the month was
``the first time we've had high-level U.S. officials go to the
People's Republic of China.''
   A week later the White House disclosed that the two officials
who made the December trip, national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, had
visited Beijing on a secret mission in July _ just a month after
the Chinese government used force to suppress pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   ``I was trying to protect the confidentiality of a classified
presidential mission,'' Baker said Sunday on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press.'' ``If I misled anybody I regret that but if I did I only
misled them for seven days,'' he said, referring to the public
disclosure of the July trip a week after Baker called the December
Scowcroft-Eagleburger visit a first.
   Asked if the government officials should deliberately mislead
the public to protect secrets, Baker, said:
   ``No, we should not. And that's why I've said I regret it. ... I
could simply have `no commented,' which is what I should have done.
... I regret that and certainly I should have found a better way to
answer the question.''

<HEAD>Rival Moslem Militias Battle For Second Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias battled
Sunday for the second day with tanks and artillery in the hills of
south Lebanon, ignoring a cease-fire appeal from Iran.
   Police said 15 people were killed and 53 wounded in the clashes
between the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
Syrian-armed Amal in the Iqlim al-Tuffah, or the apple province in
south Lebanon.
   By police count, 32 people have been killed and 98 wounded since
fighting erupted before dawn Saturday, when Hezbollah forces
overran four Amal-held villages in the southern panhandle.
   Amal rushed reinforcements from Beirut to the south Sunday.
About 2,500 fighters, backed by tanks, counterattacked under a
barrage of heavy artillery and recaptured two villages, Mjaidel and
Kfar Hatta, police reported.
   The fighting is the latest flare-up in a 2{-year-old power
struggle between the rival factions for supremacy of Lebanon's 1.2
million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   The casualties raised the overall toll since May 1987 to 603
killed and 1,677 wounded.
   The fighting spread to Moslem west Beirut during the night with
Hezbollah and Amal fighters clashing in the Hamra commercial
district.
   Police said the clash erupted when Amal militiamen firing
machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades tried to storm a
Hezbollah religious center. A dozen guards defending the center
held them off for four hours before Syrian troops moved in and
enforced a truce.
   Several cars were wrecked in the fighting and the steel shutters
on several shops were blown off. But police said there were no
casualties reported in the clash.
   Mohammad Ali Besharati, Iran's deputy foreign minister, who flew
from Tehran to the Syrian capital, Damascus, had declared a
cease-fire after meeting Amal leader Nabih Berri, who is also
Lebanon's Water Resources Minister; Sheik Subhi Tofeili, a senior
Hezbollah cleric; and Hussein Musavi, the organization's top
security chief.
   Berri blamed Hezbollah for starting the fighting. Hezbollah
accused Amal of preventing fundamentalist guerrillas from attacking
Israel from south Lebanon.
   Amal opposes raids on Israel on the grounds it provokes
reprisals against the predominantly Shiite south.
   Sheik Mohammad Mahdi Shamsheddin, the senior Shiite religious
leader in Lebanon, also arrived in Damascus seeking to negotiate an
end to the bloodshed.
   As darkness fell, the fighting centered around two other
villages seized by Hezbollah, Kfar Milki and Kfar Kila, about five
miles northeast of Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon.
   Reporters who reached Kfar Hatta said virtually every house in
the village of 2,000 people had been damaged by shells and gunfire.
Broken power cables dangled on burned-out cars.
   Amal's military commander in Kfar Hatta, Mashour Ghossein, told
reporters: ``We'll stop fighting only when we regain every inch of
territory seized by Hezbollah.''
   The disputed villages sit atop a chain of strategic hills that
control the main supply routes to Hezbollah's strongholds further
south in Jbaa, Ein Bouswar and Jarjou.
   These Shiite-populated towns have long been used by Hezbollah
guerrillas for attacks on the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia in south Lebanon.

   The name doesn't matter. Any Democratic
heavyweight will do: They're all professing no interest whatsoever
in taking on President Bush in 1992.
   ``I have no plans to run for president in 1992,'' declares Sen.
Sam Nunn of Georgia.
   ``I'm focusing on my re-election next year,'' says Sen. Al Gore
of Tennessee.
   ``I'm not running and I'm not making any plans to run,'' chimes
in Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   Ditto for Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gov. Mario Cuomo of
New York and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson.
   So is it Bush and Quayle unopposed for re-election in 1992?
   No chance.
   While there is remarkably little overt activity among the
potential Democratic challengers, there is always something
stirring in presidential politics. Even those who deny any interest
find their hearts beat a little faster when they breathe the cool,
clean air of Iowa and New Hampshire.
   Bradley was in Des Moines over the summer to speak at a
fund-raiser for Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who faces a tough
Republican challenge in 1990. While he was there, he met with Tony
Bisignano, a union official and state legislator.
   Bisignano was impressed.
   He said they didn't talk about 1992, but he'd be eager to start
a ``low-key, grassroots organization'' to drum up support for
Bradley.
   Bentsen, meanwhile, was the featured speaker at the Iowa
Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner this fall.
   New Hampshire, the state which has the quadrennial distinction
of holding the first presidential primary, has had visits in 1989
from Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado and Gov. Richard Celeste of
Ohio. Both came close to entering the 1988 presidential race.
   Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska had a long lunch in Boston this
fall with a group of political operatives who have had extensive
experience in Democratic presidential campaigns.
   ``He just wanted to know what was on people's minds,'' said
Larry Rasky, a public relations executive who worked on Sen. Joe
Biden's 1988 campaign.
   Cuomo has said an indication that he is planning a presidential
bid would be an announcement that he will not run for a third term
as governor of New York. He's not giving that signal, at least not
now.
   In a telephone interview, he said he's leaning toward another
gubernatorial campaign.
   ``There's just nothing I can do that's as important as this,''
he said.
   But somehow, Cuomo finds it impossible to stop thinking about
running for president.
   An example of his ambivalence came last summer when he invited a
reporter to ask him about the possibility that he might seek the
presidency.
   ``I want to talk about it, because I want to dispose of it,'' he
said, declaring that he was tired of speculation about his plans.
   ``And so,'' he said, ``for the time being I'm not going to
discuss it.''

   Leonardo da Vinci long ago drew a
flying machine powered by a man cranking levers that could take off
vertically and hover above the Earth.
   Five centuries and thousands of inventors later, da Vinci's
dream of a human-powered helicopter was realized this month by
students at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis
Obispo.
   The Dec. 10 flight of the Da Vinci III, powered by an Olympic
bicyclist, lasted just a few seconds and got the craft only a few
inches off the ground.
   Even so, it was the first ever flight by a human-powered
helicopter and was hailed as a historic aviation achievement.
   As a result, the Cal Poly students are spending Christmas break
raising money and designing the Da Vinci IV.
   ``Until this point, nobody had ever broken the pull of the
Earth. This is a great leap forward,'' said Mark Paris, spokesman
for the American Helicopter Society in Alexandria, Va., an
organization of engineers.
   The 97-pound Da Vinci III, completely designed and built by
undergraduate engineering students, officially flew for 6.8
seconds, rising eight inches off a gym floor on this campus halfway
between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   The Dec. 10 flight, made before an official from the National
Aeronautic Association and a cheering crowd, and two November
practice flights left the inventors feeling like Orville and Wilbur
Wright must have felt at Kitty Hawk.
   ``I was very surprised,'' said Neal Saiki, a 23-year-old senior
and the guiding force of the project since 1987. ``The time it
first took off, I wasn't really expecting it, to tell you the
truth. Then it was just all kinds of emotions going through me.''
   The project has been in the works off and on since 1980, with
much of the work done in a cluttered workshop. The whole project
has cost about $100,000, money donated from aerospace companies and
private contributors.
   It has taken several versions of the helicopter, hundreds of
hours behind a computer, scores of crashes and other mishaps, and
lots of old-fashioned head scratching before the students came up
with a workable design.
   In the end, they found they didn't so much have to refine
helicopter technology as virtually reinvent the machine. What they
have created is a craft that looks more like a spinning wing than a
helicopter.
   The Da Vinci III has a 100-foot rotor made of carbon graphite
fiber (the stuff in expensive golf clubs), heavy-duty foam and a
covering similar to the plastic that dry cleaners put around
clothes.
   The pilot sits in a contraption made of lightweight metal and
balsa wood that hangs from the rotor on a swivel. Bicycle pedals,
rather than the levers in da Vinci's design, operate the Cal Poly
helicopter.
   Even at top speed, the rotor moves slowly, taking about six
seconds for one rotation.
   One key change from earlier helicopters was having the rotor
support a dangling driver, instead of the driver's compartment
propping up the rotor. The change shaved 35 pounds off previous
designs.
   ``Even though this seems like an obvious solution, it took years
to come up with it,'' said Saiki.
   The students hope to save more weight in the next design. Saiki
said, ``We'd like to have someone other that Greg McNeil be able to
drive this thing.''
   McNeil is a Cal Poly student and member of the U.S. Olympic
cycling team who had to pedal as if it were the final lap for the
gold medal before the helicopter got off the ground.
   Even a new and improved human helicopter, the students and their
faculty adviser concede, will have few if any practical
applications. But that doesn't seem to bother them as they go back
to the drawing board.
   ``Saying this isn't practical is like telling the Wright
Brothers, `Sure, you flew, but you didn't make it to Europe,'''
said the adviser, engineering professor Bill Patterson. ``Just
proving the skeptics wrong was enough.''

<TEXT>
   The ouster of Romanian strongman Nicolae
Ceausescu is proving to be the bloodiest phase so far in the
revolution that has ended all six hardline communist regimes in the
Warsaw Pact since the summer.
   Security forces loyal to Ceausescu battled rebels through the
weekend, in contrast to neighboring nations, where reform forces
have come to power relatively peacefully.
   The conflict was part of the heritage of Ceausescu's
quarter-century rule, which virtually destroyed the nation's
economic and political fabric, and makes Romania's future cloudier
than those of other Eastern European countries emerging from the
darkness of dictatorship.
   ``The fact that Ceausescu is gone in itself is fantastic, but we
are not out of the woods by any means,'' said Juliana Geran Pilon,
who was born in Romania and now directs the National Forum
Foundation, a conservative Washington lobbying group.
   When the fighting ends, Romania promises to be in worse shape
than the other Soviet nations.
   ``Romania more than any other of the Eastern Europe countries
needs direct Western help in the form of food,'' said James Brown,
a specialist on the region at the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, Calif.
   Winters can be harsh in Romania, which is as far north as Maine
or Minnesota, and the land is desperately short of food and heating
fuel, Brown said.
   Moreover, thousands of Romanians reportedly died in fighting
before and after Ceausescu's ouster, in contrast to the nearly
bloodless revolutions in Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria and Hungary.
   Ceausescu was replaced by the National Salvation Committee
transitional government, composed of civilian and military leaders,
some of whom had fallen into disfavor or been jailed under the old
regime.
   The leading figure in the new government appeared to be former
Foreign Minister Corneliu Manescu, 73, who has been under house
arrest in Bucharest since he and seven other top communists wrote a
highly critical letter to Ceausescu last March.
   Another civilian in the leadership was Ion Iliescu, who was
ousted as secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee in
1971 and is reputed to be a strong advocate of reforms. Iliescu
attended Moscow State University with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, according to Ms. Pilon and another Romanian emigre,
Michael Radu.
   ``He is the closest you can get to a reformer of the Gorbachev
type in the Romanian Communist Party,'' said Radu, who is now a
resident scholar at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think
tank in Philadelphia.
   Manescu already has promised elections, although it was not
clear when or under what circumstances they would be held, or who
would run.
   Ceausescu eliminated not only the two former political parties,
the National Liberals and the Peasants, but rival communists as
well, said Petre Nicolae, a former Romanian Communist Party member
who emigrated in 1981.
   Equally pressing for the new government will be the economic
recovery of Romania, which ``is by natural resources the richest in
Eastern Europe, but under Ceausescu developed the worst economy,
with the lowest living standard,'' said Brown. Only Albania, a
communist nation not allied with Moscow, is poorer, he said.
   Ceausescu collectivized once-productive Romanian farms, driving
peasants into the cities to work on heavy industry, which he was
simultaneously building, said Radu.
   Romania was forced to import raw materials for its industry,
however, building up a huge foreign debt that Ceausescu paid off
through austerity that forced the people to live on a
``semi-starvation diet'' with inadequate heating oil and
electricity, said Radu.
   Another rock may lie hidden on Romania's course to recovery,
said Brown and Pilon. The population of the neighboring Soviet
republic of Moldavia is composed 65 percent of ethnic Romanians,
and the republic, one of 15 in the Soviet Union, was seized by the
Soviet Union in one of the Nazi-Stalin pacts at the dawn of World
War II.
   Any popular movement to reunite Romania and Moldavia could cause
friction with the Soviet Union.
   ``Romania is the last domino to fall of the Soviets' East
European allies,'' said Brown. The demise of Ceausescu means that
``all of Eastern Europe is farther along on the path to democracy
than the Soviet Union.''
   That could inspire ethnic groups in the Soviet Union to increase
their campaigns for greater freedom.
   ``The leaders of the national front in Moldavia have been rather
shy of seeking to rejoin Romania as long as Ceausescu was alive.''
But the greater freedom in Romania may embolden them, and ``that
will present a problem for the integrity of the Soviet Union,''
said Brown.
   For the time being, however, ``any new regime that emerges in
Bucharest will have other things on its mind.''

   The day before Christmas, Panama City
sits in a pile of its own wreckage. Where a week earlier Christmas
lights glittered, sunlight now shimmers off glass shards in
shattered shop windows.
   More people than usual walk about with bandaged hands. ``Three
more looting days until Christmas,'' one visitor observed.
   Christmas music still filters from a few homes in this mostly
Roman Catholic country, but with shops looted bare and no new
supplies imminent, Monday will be just another hungry day for most
people here.
   At night there is the occasional hollow thump of mortar fire. A
spark ignites against the sky and a flare lights up the tropical
dark, swaying lazily on a parachute invisible from the ground.
   It fades away, leaving a puff of white smoke.

   Driving from place to place involves negotiating roadblocks, set
up every few hundred feet in some neighborhoods by armed residents
protecting their property.
   There are piles of tree limbs, old oil barrels, broken furniture
and miscellaneous rubbish and, in several places, Christmas trees.
   There is so much rubbish that driving even short distances
frequently results in a flat.

   There are a few hints of Christmas left in the capital but they
are tattered.
   These days, white flags flutter from antennas of the few
vehicles still on the usually snarled streets.
   At a destroyed police station in the former Panama Canal Zone,
cardboard cutouts of two of the three kings still stand. The third
lies on the lawn, riddled with bullet holes.

   The traditional nine days of ``posadas'' for children,

   Looters packed boxes and bags from shops. At one supermarket a
man said he arrived too late for food but had clothes for his
children.
   ``This is their Christmas,'' he said.
   Another toted a case of champagne. ``This is mine,'' he grinned.
   One of the few stations selling gas had been taken over by
neighborhood residents who were filling the tanks and pocketing the
money.
   ``How much to fill the tank?'' asked one driver.
   ``Whatever you want to pay,'' came the reply. ``How about five
dollars?'' Gas sells for about $2 a gallon in Panama.
   ``The owner left in a hurry,'' said the ``attendant.'' ``He
forgot the keys. People here don't have any money. The owner won't
miss it.''

   Men guarding roadblocks with antique shotguns and whatever else

   ``Just tell me, where can we get a beer in this country these

   When the phone rang the other day in Joe
Shanahan's office, he wasn't surprised to find an aide to Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen on the line, looking to trade gossip about a
political consultant.
   ``I have a lot of newfound friends in Bentsen's office,'' said
Shanahan, spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party.
   Bentsen, the Texas senator who was the Democrats' vice
presidential nominee in 1988, isn't the only prominent Democrat
keeping tabs on Iowa, the state with the first caucuses in the
presidential sweepstakes.
   Those mulling a run for the White House in 1992 _ or consultants
looking to align themselves with a presidential campaign _ are
keeping an eye on 1990 elections in Iowa, which has tough contests
for governor and Senate.
   ``Anybody who is looking down the road to 1992 has a good reason
to visit the state,'' said Phil Roeder, political director for
Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who is being challenged next year by
Republican Rep. Tom Tauke.
   Indeed, many potential 1992 Democratic candidates have been
stopping in Iowa of late.
   New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley came to raise money for Harkin, and
activists on hand said there was some informal talk about the
possibility of a Bradley presidential bid.
   Bentsen was the featured speaker at the state Democratic Party's
annual fund-raiser this past fall, denying any interest in running
for president in 1992 but nonetheless taking time to talk to
reporters about his ideas for national election strategy.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, winner of the 1988 Iowa
caucuses, visited recently, and Jesse Jackson was on hand the day
after the last election and since to speak at a funeral.
   ``Those people have been out here under the auspices of helping
the Democratic Party,'' said Shanahan. ``You can read whatever you
want into that, but we're glad they're here.''
   And, although President Bush is expected to be unopposed for the
Republican nomination should he seek re-election, Democrats haven't
had the state to themselves.
   Texas Sen. Phil Gramm and television evangelist Pat Robertson,
an unsuccessful 1988 GOP presidential candidate who finished second
in Iowa last year behind Sen. Bob Dole, have dropped in for quick
visits, fueling speculation they might be looking down the road to
1996.
   Iowa political operatives aren't surprised at the early
attention; presidential candidates who have done well here often
began their caucus campaigns a year or more before the vote.
   Said Roeder:
   ``If we get by with 12 to 15 hours of down time between the 1990
elections and the beginning of the 1992 caucuses, that will be a
pretty liberal amount of time.''

<HEAD>200 Soviet Deputies Storm Out Over Georgian Deaths; Ligachev Accused</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 deputies stormed out of the Soviet
Congress on Sunday to protest a defense of the army's brutal
crackdown on ethnic unrest in the republic of Georgia. It took a
personal appeal by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to bring them
back.
   The discussion also implicated conservative Politburo member
Yegor K. Ligachev in the decision to send troops against Georgian
protesters in April. Nineteen protesters died when soldiers armed
with shovels, clubs and gas charged them. Another person was shot
to death later for violating a curfew.
   Delegates condemned those violent tactics on Sunday.
   Georgians, Balts, progressive deputies and others left the hall
to protest a speech by the chief military prosecutor, Alexander
Katusev, who defended the Soviet troops.
   Katusev's speech followed a congressional commission's report
blaming the army, local party leadership and Ligachev for the
incident.
   Ligachev chaired a meeting of top party leaders two days before
the clash that decided to back Georgian party leaders' request for
military help in breaking up the long-running protest, commission
Chairman Anatoly Sobchak said.
   Sobchak read a letter from Ligachev admitting that when the
leadership discussed the protest in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi,
Interior and Defense Ministry officials were informed of ``the need
to provide forces and means in case of dangerous and
life-threatening events.''
   But Ligachev said in the letter he went on vacation the next day
and only learned the extent of the violence from a television
report afterward.
   ``If some leader makes a decision, I'd like to say he bears
responsibility for that decision whether he finds out about its
results on television or in his office,'' Sobchak said.
   The Georgians and other deputies left the 2,250-member Congress
of People's Deputies after Katusev portrayed the Georgian
pro-independence protesters as armed subversives who provoked the
violence.
   Minutes later, Gorbachev, surrounded by security men and
reporters, emerged into the lobby and sought out the Georgian
delegates, some of them in tears, near the cloakroom.
   ``Why are they persecuting the Georgian people?'' a Georgian
teacher, Natella Bokuchava, asked Gorbachev. ``Defend us! Our
children are watching us.''
   Gorbachev soothed the Georgians with general remarks about
ethnic tolerance, and after they returned to the hall he made a
conciliatory speech assuring them of the high respect of the
Congress and the country.
   Congress later passed a resolution condemning the use of
violence against the Georgian protesters.
   Historian Yuri Afanasyev, a leader of a fledgling opposition
group, said he thought the walkout illustrated ``the further
consolidation of democratic forces.''
   Several dozen Baltic deputies have walked out of the Congress
occasionally to protest their helplessness as a vastly outnumbered
minority, but this was by far the largest walkout since the
Congress opened its first session in May.
   In other action on the last day of its 12-day session, Congress:
   _Followed the lead of Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze in condemning the Kremlin's decision to send Soviet
troops into Afghanistan 10 years ago. The panel that examined the
decision said only four people were involved, all of them now dead:
then-leader Leonid Brezhnev, Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov,
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and KGB chief Yuri Andropov. One
deputy proposed the commission consider stripping all privileges
from their widows and families.
   _Was told that the Health Ministry's network of hospitals and
sanitariums reserved for the top party and government elite would
be abolished and given to the public by Jan. 1. Yevgeny Primakov,
head of the panel on privileges, also said the number of country
houses and cars used by officials would be cut.
   _Passed a resolution condemning the 1939 Soviet-Nazi pact that
led to the parceling up of much of Eastern Europe, including the
Baltic states.
   Legislatures in the Baltic republics have already condemned the
pact.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega allegedly
earned millions helping Colombia's cocaine lords launder drug
profits, but if that's true he didn't put too much of it into his
house.
   Compared to the extravagant mansions customary among Latin
American dictators, the Noriega house is modest _ a two-story
affair in a neat, upper middle-class neighborhood. Its walls are
painted white and topped by a red tile roof, classic tropical
architecture.
   ``He would only say `Hello,' very respectfully,'' said German
Sanchez, 53, who was the military leader's next-door neighbor 16
years but was never formally introduced to him.
   ``You may think what you like of Noriega, but we can't say he
was anything but respectful toward his neighbors,'' he said.
   Sanchez's house is between Noriega's and a smaller house on a
corner that Noriega also owned. ``The servants and guests stayed
there,'' Sanchez said.
   Reporters allowed into the house Saturday did not find any
evidence of voodoo or black magic, which Noriega was rumored to
have practiced.
   But the general apparently admired Napoleon Bonaparte and hung
two pictures of the French emperor in his second-story study.
   The house wraps around three sides of a 45-square-foot courtyard
where a stone fountain was bubbling water.
   A small room had been converted into a chapel. A six-foot
crucifix hung on a wall behind an altar. An oil painting of St.
George slaying the dragon hung on another wall.
   Noriega seemed to be in the Christmas spirit. An eight-foot
Christmas tree trimmed with stuffed dolls and other adornments
stood in a back terrace, next to a manger.
   About two dozen cardboard boxes and black plastic garbage bags
were stuffed with toys, games and gifts for children.
   U.S. troops stormed the Noriega family home Wednesday, using
stun grenades that shattered glass jalousies and hand-painted vases
and flowerpots.
   All the windows in Noriega's bedroom were blown away, as was
most of the ceiling over his king-size bed.
   One of two walk-in closets held a combination safe and a locked
metal strongbox. The safe was open and empty, with two plastic bags
of dehumidifying crystals inside. A bullet destroyed the keyhole of
the metal cabinet.
   A U.S. soldier assigned to guard the house picked up a wooden
plaque with ``Battalion 2000'' painted on it. That is the elite
unit Noriega named in honor of the year Panama is to take over the
Panama Canal.
   It is not clear how much Noriega used the house recently. He was
reportedly sleeping in different locations every night, fearing
coup attempts. Little is known of his personal life.
   Sanchez, a lawyer and member of the board of directors of the
Panamanian Chamber of Commerce, said he had just arrived home from
a cocktail party early Wednesday when the U.S. attack began.
   ``About five minutes before that, two small cars with armed men
inside rode up to the house and then everybody left right away,''
Sanchez said.

<HEAD>Disabled Miner Wants No Tree at Tough Christmas</HEAD>

   There's no Christmas tree to brighten Jesse
Crabtree's living room, and the disabled coal miner has no holiday
cheer this season.
   ``He says, `Why get a tree if we don't have any gifts to put
under it?''' said Crabtree's wife, Edith.
   Crabtree, 68, suffers from black lung disease _ caused by
breathing coal dust _ and has been hospitalized for two heart
attacks and prostate gland surgery. He also was hurt in a 1976
mining accident and now spends his retirement money on medicine
rather than Christmas.
   ``Now, Jesse just sits there in the bedroom, day in and day out,
looking out the window. That's his life,'' Mrs. Crabtree said.
   Crabtree blamed their economic plight on the bitter battle
between the United Mine Workers and the Pittston Coal Group Inc. A
union poster is taped to the wall near his bed.
   Nearly 1,700 miners struck Pittston's coal subsidiary in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky on April 5, after working 14
months without a contract. The walkout was prompted by Pittston's
refusal to participate in an industry agreement on how to fund
costly miners' retirement and health plans.
   The UMW and Pittston failed Saturday in a last-ditch effort to
reach a pre-Christmas settlement. Negotiations recessed with an
agreement that both sides would return to the bargaining table
Wednesday.
   Mrs. Crabtree said she and her husband get $911 a month through
retirement benefits and black lung program payments. Their mortgage
and medical bills alone exceed that.
   ``We're making it from hand to mouth. We're poor but we're
proud,'' Mrs. Crabtree said. ``We had a little bit of savings put
away.''
   For a while, the couple's Christmas dinner was uncertain.
   ``I don't even know if I'm going to have a turkey or a ham,''
Mrs. Crabtree said just before the president of a UMW local arrived
with a 15-pound turkey.
   ``She said she needed a turkey for Christmas. I told her it
would be no trouble,'' said Bethel Purkey from UMW Local 5815.
   Crabtree is upset Pittston changed its pensioner health policy.
After the old contract ran out, the policy began providing 80
percent coverage after a $200 deductible. It had been 100 percent.
   ``Pittston owes him and should pay his medical bills. They are
the ones that caused his problems,'' his wife said.
   Pittston spokeswoman Susan Copeland said 80 percent coverage is
a nationwide standard.
   Cheryl van Tilburg, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross-Blue Shield in
Chicago, the nation's largest health insurer, said ``80-20 is
definitely the norm for group coverage.''
   Crabtree, a union miner for more than 37 years, also is upset
the UMW worked for Pittston for 14 months without a contract. He
said it's possible the company would have continued full coverage
for pensioners if a contract had been reached.
   ``If they had gone on strike then, they'd have a contract now,''
Crabtree said. ``No contract, no work. If a fellow (strike breaker)
wanted to go on in, you keep him from going. You can't have anyone
going in while others are staying out.''
   Mrs. Crabtree said a 100 percent health plan would give her one
less thing to worry about.
   ``I'm 4 feet, 11 inches tall. He's 230-some pounds and I handle
him alone,'' she said. ``I take him to the doctor alone, pull the
car up to the garage. Don't ask me how I do it.''
   One way she does it is by letting Christmas pass virtually
unnoticed.
   ``He needs me and he knows I'll be there,'' Mrs. Crabtree said.
``Mister, I'll never let him down.''

   A powerful explosion rocked the storage

   No injuries were immediately reported, but the explosion touched
off a roaring fire and sent a plume of smoke 500 feet in the air,
said East Baton Rouge Civil Defense spokesman Ed Wright.
   The tank storage area is near a pipeline, Wright said.
   The blast shattered windows in the surrounding area and the
concussion could be felt as far away as 15 miles, residents said.
   A brief power outage was reported immediately after the
explosion, Wright said.

   Did it seem like a script for a movie? Former
President Reagan showed up on the Southern Cal practice field for a
pep talk and a short but snappy pass with the Rose Bowl-bound
Trojan squad.
   ``Win one for the Gipper,'' Reagan said, repeating Pat O'Brien's
line from the 1940 film ``Knute Rockne-All American'' in which
Reagan starred as the doomed George Gipp.
   Reagan, wearing blue jeans, a checked shirt open at the collar
and track shoes, spent about 20 minutes Saturday chatting at the
50-yard line with the players.
   Reagan, who was a right guard in college for the Eureka Golden
Tornadoes, has shed his presidential neutrality since leaving
office and is a big Trojans fan, Coach Larry Smith said.
   ``He's in Southern California now, so he's a fan of the Southern
California football team,'' said Smith, whose squad will meet the
Michigan Wolverines in Pasadena for the Jan. 1 Rose Bowl game.
   Reagan was asked to throw a football to USC's top receiver, John
Jackson, who ran about 10 yards and cut to his right.
   ``I think at my age, you better keep it a very short pattern,''
said Reagan, 78, as he cocked and fired a bullet right into
Jackson's grip.
   ``I'll take him,'' Jackson, 22, later said. ``He's got a nice,
tight spiral.''
   Reagan was presented with a large-sized, cardinal and
gold-colored sweatsuit and he slapped ``high-fives'' with the
players and crouched on one knee for a team photo.
   Then he strolled off.
   ``Everybody's familiar with the president, but few get to catch
a pass from him,'' Jackson said. ``I'm going to go call my mom
right now.''

   Dave Stewart is pitching in to help put
his hometown back on its feet following the October earthquake that
devasted the Bay area and delayed the World Series in which the
Oakland A's pitcher won two games.
   Stewart, the series' most valuable player, has been making
appearances at local business functions to help raise money for
community rebuilding. He also will spend a week next month talking
about the drug problem at area schools, is on the board of
directors of the Oakland Boys Club and frequently speaks for the
Just Say No drug campaign.
   ``I'm born here; I'm raised here,'' he said last week. ``That's
the difference. I wouldn't expect a player born in Mobile, Ala.,
and playing in Oakland to care as much as I do. Part of my
character comes from this city. It's my roots.''
   During the series in which the A's shut out the San Francisco
Giants in four games, Stewart spent his days at the ballpark and
his nights driving to the Oakland freeway that collapsed during the
quake to watch rescuers pull bodies from the wreckage.

   Some 7,000 fans showed up at a party to say
goodbye to Steve Largent after he played his last game for the
Seattle Seahawks.
   ``I wish I was as neat as you all think I am but I'm not,''
Largent told the capacity crowd at the Washington State Convention
Center.
   Seattle's homeless will benefit from the $70,000 the party
produced, including $5,500 given by Largent's teammates.
   Largent, the Seahawks' record-setting wide receiver, went out in
a losing game Saturday, a 29-0 beating from the Washington Redskins.
   But judging from the tribute, Largent, 35, was anything but a
loser.
   ``You are one of those people who really have made a
difference,'' President Bush told Largent by videotape. ``I offer
my heartfelt thanks not only from the community of Seattle but from
this president.''
   ``Several times when I've watched you, I wanted to shout, `Win
one for the Gipper,''' former President Reagan said in another
videotaped message. ``You are truly a role model for the rest of
us.''
   ``For a guy too slow and too short, you sure fooled a lot of
people,'' Los Angeles Raiders defensive back Mike Haynes said in a
telegram.

   Sting says the idea that rock 'n' roll music is
rebellious is ``totally dead.''
   ``It has the semblance of rebellion but all these bands with
their long hair, wearing their sister's clothes and playing heavy
metal music, they strike me as being very close to Las Vegas
bands,'' he told Street News, a newspaper sold by the homeless, for
its January edition.
   ``They're not rebellious at all; they're conforming to very
obvious norms and I'm not particularly impressed by that. I just
don't think rock and roll is dangerous at all. It's everywhere, on
all the airwaves day and night. There's nothing new or unusual
about it,'' he said.
   The 38-year-old musician left his band, The Police, after it
became one of the most popular groups.
   Sting says it doesn't always make sense even to him that he is
starring in ``3 Penny Opera,'' a Broadway musical closing at the
end of the year.
   ``From a commercial point of view there's no benefit whatsoever
for anybody. It's just a way of saying, `I want to try something
else,''' he said. ``What I try to do in my life is kind of throw
curves all the time.''

   Here is the text of President Bush's radio
address Sunday to U.S. armed forces.
   Hello to all our men and women in uniform and to your families,
and a special salute to those right now engaged in restoring
democracy and freedom in Panama.
   This has been an historic and extraordinary year for our nation
and, indeed, the world. Just sit back and think for a moment, about
the dramatic events of 1989, so many of them events about freedom,
democray, man's quest to determine his own destiny.
   You know, Chancellor Kohl of Germany called me just after the
Berlin Wall came down. And he told me that this incredible event
could not have occurred without America's resolve demonstrated in
Europe and around the world over the last 40 years. You, the men
and women of our armed forces, you are the embodiment of America's
resolve.
   I have talked with you before tonight during this past year at
Elmendorf, or Rhein Main, and Pease, and on the landing decks of
the America and the Forrestal, or the bridge of the Belknap, and
seen first hand, the job you do for our country. And I've seen you
at the times when America remembers her fallen sons and daughters,
at the cemetery in Nettuno, Italy, last May; at the Iwo Jima
memorial in June or at the Texas Vietnam memorial, just last month.
   And finally, I've been with you when we must share our grief for
those more recently lost in defense of freedom. In April, with the
men behind the guns of the proud battleship Iowa.
   Now, brave Americans have died again in combat, just last week.
In Panama, as in every other such test in our history, Americans
put their lives on the line for the basic values of liberty and
decency on which our nation is founded.
   Our hearts and those of every American go out to the families of
those who fell. To all those who mourn a husband, a son, a brother,
a father or a friend, I can only offer the thanks of a grateful
nation. Your loved ones served a noble and just cause with honor
and distinction.
   Not long ago, I shook the hand of a woman who had lost two sons
in war. She'd said that it would be an honor to shake the hand of
the President of the United States. But in truth, I was the one
honored to shake her hand, for it is she and millions of other
mothers and fathers, daughters and sons, whose decency, service,
and courage embody the spirit of America.
   Wherever you are, whatever your rank or branch of service, I
want you to remember something about America. We are a people with
the endurance to work day and night for peaceful solutions when we
can. But we are also a people with the strength to confront tyranny
when we must. General Noriega is the latest one to learn that
lesson.
   It is Christmas Eve. Forty-five years ago to this very day, I
arrived home from the Pacific. History has long since passed
judgment on those years of conflict. But that war did not end all
wars, and today we still live in times of great challenge, and
there are still times when America must sacrifice in the cause of
peace.
   Years from now, let it be said that America used her strength
for good, and let it be known that she honored her defenders of
freedom.
   Merry Christmas to all of you, and thank you. God bless you, and
God bless the cause of freedom.

Backed</HEAD>

   Hearts and wallets opened all over the world for
the embattled Romanian people Sunday, and the United States and
France said they would not oppose Soviet bloc military intervention.
   The International Red Cross led new efforts to send in food and
medical aid, but fighting prevented most relief flights from
landing in Bucharest and many convoys were stalled at the borders.
   France said it was willing to help muster a ``brigade of
volunteers'' if asked to aid Romanians fighting security forces
loyal to ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said on radio station RTL that he
told Soviet officials if Moscow decided to intervene, France ``not
only would not object to it, but would support this action.''
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III said in a television
interview that the Romanians were fighting a ``repressive
dictatorship, so I think that we would be inclined probably to
follow the lead, follow the example of France, who today has said
that if the Warsaw Pact felt it necessary to intervene on behalf of
the opposition that it would support that.''
   The Dutch government said military intervention would ``support
the aspirations of the Romanian people,'' but it recognized the
``enormous dilemma'' over the issue, given the bitter memories of
past Soviet interventions in East bloc countries.
   But Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov on Saturday all but ruled out
military Soviet intervention. Moscow has mobilized humanitarian
aid, and the Soviet news agency Tass reported Sunday that trains
were massing on the Soviet-Romanian border with medical supplies,
food and clothes.
   Hungarian radio said 250 trucks and an equal number of cars
loaded with medicine, bandages and food reached Romania from
neighboring Hungary but that little was getting through the
country's other borders.
   An East German aircraft carrying medical supplies landed at an
unidentified Romanian airport Sunday, the East German news agency
ADN reported.
   Public collections went up in virtually every country of Eastern
and Western Europe.
   In Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, Communist Party officials
donated party membership fees for the month of December to
suffering Romanian families.
   The British Red Cross said it collected $80,000 in just 24 hours.
   Sweden pledged $3.1 million in assistance.
   The Portuguese Red Cross said it collected donations over the
weekend and would send 30 aid workers with a planeload of food and
medicine to Romania.
   Queen Margrethe II of Denmark decided to return decorations she
received from Ceausescu, news reports said. On Friday, Britain's
Queen Elizabeth II stripped Ceausescu of his honorary knighthood.
   In Tripoli, Libya, students marched ``in support for and
solidarity with the Romanian people's revolution,'' the official
news agency JANA said.
   They handed a petition to the Romanian Embassy saying events in
Romania ``show the falsehood and failure of the goverment idea,
parties, the tyranny and oppression as well as dictatorship,'' JANA
said.
   Grigor Gysi, the East German Communist leader, welcomed the
Ceausescu government's ouster, saying in a statement carried by
ADN: ``Its monstrous anti-human terrorism, slaughter and bloodshed
prove once again that the regime of the Ceausescu clan has nothing,
absolutely nothing to do with socialism.''
   At least 23 Romanian embassies switched allegiance to the new
provisional government, and three states recognized the National
Salvation Committee that claimed to control Romania.
   Romania's first deputy prime minister, Gheorghe Oprea, who was
in Turkey on an official visit when Ceausescu was toppled, told
reporters in Istanbul Saturday night that he rejoiced in Romania's
liberation.
   ``As a Romanian citizen, I will do everything I can for my
country. I support the freedom movement and will return to my
country to fight and work for the success of the new system,'' the
Anatolia news agency quoted him as saying.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual leader of the
Church of England and head of the 70 million member Anglican
Communion, asked all congregations to pray for the Romanian people
at Christmas services.
   Prince Carol of Romania, half-brother of King Michael of Romania
who lives in Switzerland, was in the congregation at a special
service for London's Romanian community at the Russian Orthodox
Church in Kensington.
   ``We are here to remember those who have fallen,'' he said.
   ``It hurt me to see the pictures of violence coming out of
Romania, where they are trying to get rid of a madman who is only
there for his own benefit.''
   In Hong Kong, hundreds of people put wreaths in a downtown park
on Saturday to mourn Romania's dead and held a candle-lit rally.
   The Geneva-Based International Committee of the Red Cross said
an eight-member team that flew to Bucharest on Friday night
remained trapped in the airport vicinity with four tons of urgently
neeeded medical supplies. Spokesman Joerg Bischof said members have
cared for at least 600 wounded civilians and military since their
arrival.
   On Christmas Day, a DC-10 chartered by the Netherlands Red Cross
was to stop over at Geneva to pick up 60 tons of medical supplies
provided by the Swiss Red Cross.
   The French government sent two planeloads of medical supplies
and emergency medical teams to Romania.

<DATELINE>ORADEA, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this northern city, rejoicing that
``the rat'' Ceausescu had fallen was tinged with fear, rumors of
retribution and an almost crazed desire to talk after 24 years of
dictatorship.
   Oradea, about 10 miles from the Hungarian border, saw no
fighting in the revolution that toppled the country's autocratic
leader, Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Revelers with a foot on the gas pedal and hands on the horn
honked and screamed their joy as they careened down streets in a
wild outburst of euphoria.
   In the local city hall, a group of intellectuals, Communists who
fell from Ceausescu's favor, and students was in session
continuously from Friday, when word of the dictator's fall in
Bucharest reached Oradea, about 300 miles northwest.
   Thousands of people milled outside, listening to speaker after
speaker grab a microphone to repeat how bad the old regime was,
proclaim the new freedom and and urge everyone to remain vigilant.
   But jubilation was tempered with the creeping fear that the
dreaded Securitate secret police forces loyal to Ceausescu would
attack the city of 198,000.
   In Oradea hospital, there were no wounded _ in fact, there
seemed to be no patients at all _ but scores of soldiers
outnumbered hospital staff, manning windows and exits in case the
Securitate arrived.
   A nurse said people were afraid even to enter the hospital after
hearing that Ceausescu forces had entered a hospital in another
city and shot the wounded as they lay in bed.
   Residents throughout the region warned visitors against picking
up hitchhikers. They might be security men dressed in dirty clothes
trying to move west toward the Hungarian border, they claimed. They
will leave unpinned grenades in your car, they warned.
   The fear swirled everywhere amid the small joys, such as eggs
being available for the first time in weeks.
   On the road toward Cluj, a truck driver stopped, his windshield
shot through by a bullet. Don't go on, he warned. There's fighting.
   He heard that a car had sped down a main street in Cluj, with
plainclothes men shooting indiscriminately from its window. Twelve
people died, he heard.
   ``Tyrant'' and ``rat'' were the only words anybody used for
Ceausescu here.
   ``The rat is finished!'' the crowd yelled outside city hall
Saturday. ``Timisoara! Bucharest!'' they chanted, honoring the two
cities where thousands of people died in the revolt.
   ``Toekes! Toekes!'' was another chant, in honor of Laszlo
Toekes, the ethnic Hungarian pastor whose attempted arrest Dec. 15
sparked the revolt.
   The privations Ceausescu imposed on his people while himself
living in opulent homes were evident in Oradea's sparse food stores.
   One large shop Saturday had virtually nothing but shelves and
shelves of jam of uncertain vintage.
   Crowds of ethnic Hungarians gathered around two visitors from
Hungary. After almost 25 years of dictatorship, it was as if the
floodgates had opened for them.
   ``You know they don't let kids speak Hungarian in the schools!''
yelled one man.
   Such discrimination has been well known and publicized for years
in Hungary, but this crowd chronicled it regardless, talking as if
everybody in the outside world knew nothing of Romania because they
themselves had been kept silent for years.
   Only younger ethnic Hungarians voiced any hope that the revolt
would mend torn relations between their community and ethnic
Romanians.
   Dezsoe Kovacs, a man in his 60s, recounted years of humiliation
imposed not only by authorities, but also ordinary Romanians. He
was never promoted from his job as a factory engineer, he said,
while much less qualified Romanians climbed the career ladder.
   The area used to be almost 100 percent ethnic Hungarian. Now, it
is only 33 percent.
   Dozens of people besieged troops and civilian guards protecting
city hall entrances. One, who identified herself as Julia Sz.,
wanted only one thing _ her husband.
   In August, she said, the couple tried to flee across the border
to Hungary with their four children, aged four to 10. They were
caught.
   At Securitate headquarters, she said, she and her husband were
severely beaten as their weeping children watched. Her husband was
hauled off to jail, and she wants him back.
   ``That,'' she said, ``would make this the most beautiful
Christmas ever.''

   Revolutionary soldiers found a vast
labyrinth of safe houses and tunnels used by police forces loyal to
Nicolae Ceausescu, some with secret entries hidden in cemetery
burial vaults and subway systems.
   Army officers speaking on Bucharest radio Sunday said the
sprawling maze of tunnels criss-cross the city and link two
airports, Communist Party headquarters and Ceausescu's palace in
downtown Bucharest.
   Army units siding with pro-reform protesters have been battling
Ceausescu's secret police for control of the country. The highly
trained and heavily armed security forces have been making
hit-and-run guerrilla attacks, mostly at night.
   The radio report went into stunning detail about the hundreds of
safe houses and miles upon miles of underground tunnels stuffed
with weapons.
   Ceausescu's downtown palace contained a bunker designed to
resist nuclear attack and was outfitted like a war room, with
sophisticated command operations, the radio said.
   The tunnels also linked his so-called ``Spring Palace'' in the
north of the capital and the old royal palace downtown, near the
party headquarters, the radio said.
   One tunnel from the party headquarters ran to a lake north of
the city, apparently designed as a Ceausescu escape route.
   The revolutionary government said that the Communist dictator
who ruled for 24 years was captured Saturday along with his wife,
Elena. On Sunday, state-run Soviet television reported that the
couple was found hiding in an underground bunker. It gave no
details.
   The tunnels contained huge weapons caches and were designed for
Ceausescu's most loyal security troops, the radio said.
   Romanian radio broadcasts monitored in Vienna have appealed
repeatedly in recent days to architects involved in building the
web of tunnels to divulge the layout to the army and other forces
behind the revolt.
   ``The army found and neutralized 48 terrorists' safe houses on
just 20 streets in Bucharest,'' Bucharest radio said Sunday.
   Knowledgeable Romanians said they had heard of such safe houses
in the capital and in all major cities, but few imagined their size
and scope.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said guards had living quarters
along the most frequently traveled Ceausescu routes.
   Quoting informed Romanians, Tass said some ``terrorists'' under
fire from the army retreated to cemeteries, where they had hideouts
among burial vaults and entrances to the tunnels.
   Exiled Romanian architects who apparently were involved in
building the tunnels on Saturday called the U.S.-financed Radio
Free Europe radio station, describing details of their layout.
   ``There is one linking the Baneasa and Otopeni airports,'' in
northern Bucharest along three miles, an unidentified architect
calling from New York told the station. The broadcast was monitored
in Vienna.
   Bucharest radio said a tunnel several miles long contained
sophisticated monitoring equipment.
   On Friday night, Ceausescu's loyal troops hiding in a tunnel
opened fire on a crowd gathered in the palace square to listen to a
proclamation of the National Salvation Committee, Romania's
provisional government.
   There were new reports, meanwhile, that Arab guerrillas may be
taking part in the fighting for Ceausescu.
   Ceausescu's Romania for many years was one of the main training
camps for Arab and African guerrillas. The dictator established
cordial relations with PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Libyan
strongman Moammar Gadhafi.
   Knowledegable Romanians abroad told Radio Free Europe about two
terrorist centers at Branesti, east of Bucharest, for Arab students
and another one in a wood near the capital for senior Arab officers.
   Romania has been home to some 10,000 Arab students who study
petrochemistry, medicine and enigneering. Some of them also
attended special courses in terrorist training, reliable sources
said.
   Several years ago, obsessed with his own protection, Ceausescu
``borrowed'' Arafat's guard unit of about 50 men, Mircea Stoica, a
law professor at Bucharest University, told The Associated Press
after fleeing to Hungary last week.
   A Romanian radio announcer Saturday appealed to army units and
the population to help defend the national radio station against
``Arab troops.''
   A Syrian diplomat in Budapest told Hungarian Deputy Foreign
Minister Jozsef Benyi on Sunday that he did not exclude that
``Syrian citizens (students) were involved in the fight.''
Officials in Damascus denied Syrian involvement.
   Bucharest radio said Romanian army took prisoner several
``Arabs,'' while killing others in gunfights around the radio
building in the heart of the city in recent days.

   The revolutionary government pleaded
for peace on Christmas Eve as soldiers and citizens waged a savage
war in the streets with secret police loyal to ousted dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Sniper fire paralyzed the capital, and bodies piled up in
morgues as anarchy seemed to grip this nation struggling to break a
quarter-century of Stalinist rule.
   The embattled revolutionary government issued a cease-fire call
in a bid to disarm not only pro-Ceausescu secret police but
vigilante groups that plucked weapons from dead soldiers and sought
personal revenge against the fallen regime's supporters.
   A few families carried freshly cut Christmas trees through the
capital during a morning lull in the fighting, but sniper fire by
pro-Ceausescu forces quickly cleared the streets.
   Secret police infiltrated the television station building _
headquarters of the revolutionary governing coalition _ and three
people were reported killed before army units subdued the attackers.
   Fighting between secret police and soldiers backing the revolt
continued in the capital, but the army appeared to be winning in
the western city of Timisoara, where the revolt began a week ago.
Four Western journalists, including Associated Press correspondent
John Daniszewski, were shot and wounded there over the weekend.
   Romanian radio said secret police used scores of secret safe
houses and vast networks of tunnels in Bucharest and in Timisoara
to store weapons and launch attacks.
   Ceausescu's downtown palace was connected to the maze of tunnels
and contained a bunker designed to resist nuclear attack, Bucharest
radio said.
   The revolutionary government said the Communist dictator who
ruled for 24 years was captured Saturday along with his wife,
Elena. Soviet television said they were found hiding in an
underground bunker.
   His son, Nicu, was reported arrested Friday and on Sunday a
daughter, Zoia-Elena, appeared dazed as she was shown on Romanian
television after she was caught at one of her Bucharest apartments.
   The television also showed jewelry and cash it said totaled
nearly $100,000 in U.S. currency that was allegedly seized from the
family. Ordinary Romanians are not allowed to hold foreign currency.
   The Bush administration and the French government both said they
would not object if the Soviets or other Warsaw Pact nations use
their militaries to assist the revolution in Romania.
   Thousands of people were believed killed as Ceausescu tried to
stop the massive protests that began on Dec. 15 in Timisoara, 300
miles southwest of Bucharest. The protests spread to the capital,
forcing Ceausescu to flee his palace Friday.
   Since then, army units backing the revolt have battled the elite
secret police and security forces loyal to Ceausescu. Hundreds and
perhaps thousands have died.
   Offers of emergency aid poured in from around the world, but
East bloc media said few supplies were able to get through because
of the fighting, some of the worst street battles Europe has seen
since World War II.
   Ceausescu's secret police and security guards are essentially
fighting for their lives against the revolutionaries, who have
vowed revenge for the massacres of unarmed citizens during the
protests.
   The U.S. Embassy in Bucharest on Sunday evacuated dependents and
some staff members in a convoy to Sofia, Bulgaria, said spokesman
Agi Kuperman.
   The British ambassador's residence in Bucharest was set on fire
Saturday night and burned until Sunday morning.
   Fighting raged near Bucharest airport, although Hungarian
television later said the airport was open. In the city center,
sniper fire brought barrages of shots from the army and volunteers.
Roadblocks often manned by children searched cars and passengers,
sometimes four times in two blocks.
   At Bucharest Emergency Hospital, doctors who had not slept in
three days said they had treated 2,000 civilians since Thursday. By
noon Sunday, 90 bodies had arrived at the morgue, one of many in
Bucharest.
   The East German news agency ADN said the National Salvation
Committee estimated more than 5,000 people were killed between
Friday and Saturday night.
   Bodies lay on concrete floors at Bucharest Emergency Hospital,
identity papers taped to bare chests. Sobbing family members spent
Christmas Eve looking for lost loved ones. Victims included a
pregnant woman.
   ``It is horrible murder,'' said Dr. Stepshan Miliesescu. He said
victims came in with single shots to the head from well-trained
snipers.
   Doctors had to sedate and strap down one security guard who
raved that the revolution had upset Ceausescu's socialist paradise.
   Several heard him repeat: ``You are criminals, and we will kill
you all.''
   Ceausescu was the lone East bloc leader to resist a wave of
democratic reforms sweeping the region. He imposed harsh austerity
programs, rationing and other hardships on the nation's 23 million
people to pay off the nation's $11 billion foreign debt.
   The National Salvation Committee said in was in control of the
nation and pledged in a communique Sunday that the courts would
mete out punishments of ``the greatest severity'' to ``the dictator
and his former lackeys.''
   Ion Iliescu, a leading figure in the committee, appealed for
unity.
   ``May the first free New Year bring to Romania, together with
the joy of liberation, the quiet and calm enabling us to assume all
the responsibilities of a people asserting its dignity,'' he said.
   The group called for a cease-fire and urged civilians and
pro-Ceausescu forces to disarm by 5 p.m. Christmas Day. People who
violate it ``will receive the strictest punishment.''
   In Timisoara, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that
pro-Ceausescu security forces who parachuted into the city Friday
night were beginning to fall into the hands of the army.
   Austrian television showed film of the security forces
surrendering and being marched off by soldiers. On Saturday in
Bucharest, some security men captured by the army were shot by
soldiers on the spot.
   AP correspondent Daniszewski was shot and wounded in Timisoara
on Saturday, as was John Tagliabue of The New York Times. Both were
reported in stable condition at a hospital.
   In Bucharest, groups of teen-agers with weapons snatched from
the dead ``are trying to carry out a vendetta against the
terrorists,'' said National Salvation Committee spokesman Stephan
Andreescu.
   ``These ... forces are trying to escape and are extremely
dangerous,'' Andreescu said of the secret police. But he claimed
the army was in ``complete control of the situation in the
country.''
   ``The terrorists are believed to be hiding in the subway and in
secret underground passages below the former presidential palace,''
Andreescu said. ``It will take days before it is all over.''
   The doctors at Bucharest Emergency Hospital said pro-Ceausescu
forces were holed up in secret apartments, firing at targets in the
street. The army could not respond with heavy weapons without
blasting neighboring apartments.
   ``They are fighting like Hitler's people at the end of World War
II, just to kill in desperation,'' said a Romanian news agency
editor who did not want to be identified.
   ``They killed thousands and thousands of people,'' he said,
recounting the last years of Ceausescu. ``They killed young people,
children. You cannot imagine how awful it was. We must write about
these things.''

<HEAD>Challenge To Mandatory Retirement Provision Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER GRAFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Supreme Court Justice Louis Peck
turned 71 on Sunday, putting him a year beyond the state
constitution's retirement age for judges. But he still sits on the
bench, making decisions and waging his battle against a rule he
says is age discrimination.
   Peck's case, which goes before a federal appeals court next
week, pits him against the state of Vermont, which argues that a
federal anti-discrimination law cannot supersede a state's power to
choose its judges. On his side are others who believe that people
should be judged on their ability, not on the calendar.
   ``The right of an able person to work regardless of his or her
age is among the most basic in our society,'' the American
Association of Retired Persons, which has more than 30 million
members, said in its legal brief siding with Peck.
   ``It is the people of each state who establish the state's
judiciary,'' the state of New Mexico countered in a brief filed on
the side of Vermont.
   Peck won the first round of his case last July when a federal
judge, also 70, ruled that the federal age-discrimination law
protects appointed state judges. But federal judges in neighboring
Massachusetts have ruled the other way.
   The federal law exempts elected officials and top appointed
policy-makers, but does not specify whether appointed judges fit in
the latter category.
   The state has appealed the ruling favoring Peck to the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments are scheduled for Jan. 5
in New York.
   Peck, who was appointed to the bench in 1981, said he never
expected his fight to attract such attention, and has said he would
consider retiring after proving his point in court.
   ``When this first started, I didn't want any publicity. I just
wanted this to be settled quietly,'' he said recently. ``I must
admit the publicity it has received has stimulated my own interest
in the case and my determination to see it through.''
   Under the Vermont Constitution, Peck should have retired last
Dec. 31, at the end of the year in which he turned 70. But he
stayed on, refusing an order to step down.
   The state attorney general sided with Peck, but a series of
rulings in federal judges in neighboring Massachusetts supported a
state's right to impose mandatory retirement on state judges. The
state court administrator placed Peck on retirement status
effective June 30.
   Peck filed an age discrimination charge with the federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission challenging the retirement order.
The EEOC picked up Peck's case and filed a complaint in federal
court that resulted in the ruling in favor of Peck last July.
   The state's rights argument, however, found favor with the 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a ruling on Massachusetts'
mandatory retirement provision. The court ruled it could not find
``a sufficiently clear statement by Congress that it intended to
overrule the clear intent of the people of a state in an area
intimately and fundamentally related to that state's
self-governance.''
   The 1st Circuit ruling has meant judges in Massachusetts must
retire at age 70.
   With the conflicting rulings, lawyers on both sides are eager to
see a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``I think that's what we hope for,'' said Peck. ``Until we get
that, you are going to have courts ruling different ways.''
   Rep. Peter Smith, a Vermont Republican, has introduced
legislation designed to amend the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act to clarify that appointed state judges are covered under the
act.
   His bill, if enacted, would not be retroactive.

   Here is a brief summary of events Sunday in Romania:
   _The revolutionary government called for a cease-fire as
citizens and soldiers allied with them fought secret police loyal
to ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Sniper fire paralyzed
Bucharest and bodies piled up in morgues.
   _Vigilante groups plucked weapons from dead soldiers and sought
revenge against the fallen regime's supporters.
   _Four Western journalists, including Associated Press
correspondent John Daniszewski, were shot and wounded while
covering the fierce fighting in the western city of Timisoara.
   _Revolutionary soldiers found a vast labyrinth of safe houses
and tunnels used by police forces loyal to Ceausescu.
   _The United States and France said they would not oppose Soviet
bloc military intervention in Romania.
   _France also said it is willing to help muster a ``brigade of
volunteers'' if asked to aid the Romanian insurgency.
   _The International Red Cross led new efforts to send in food and
medical aid, but the fighting prevented most relief flights from
landing in Bucharest.
   _Romanians who long suffered religious oppression play Christmas
music throughout the country for the first time in 42 years.

   Jurors have convicted two men, acquitted
another and split on a fourth accused of killing two teen-age
brothers who failed to deliver the proceeds from $500 worth of
crack.
   Miguel Martinez Jr., 17, and Mark Christian, 26, both of New
York City, were convicted Saturday of first-degree murder,
kidnapping, conspiracy and related offenses in the deaths of
Cornell Williams, 15, and Anthony Williams, 13.
   Martinez, because of his age, was automatically sentenced to
life in prison. A hearing to determine if Christian will receive
the death penalty will begin Tuesday.
   Thirteen-year-old Joseph Jones testified that he and the
Williams brothers received $500 worth of crack to sell for a gang.
   However, the Williams' mother took $100 worth and $80 worth was
stolen by neighborhood kids, Jones said. He did not know what
happened to the rest.
   When the youths failed to deliver the money, they were kidnapped
March 12, 1988, and ordered to work off the debt in a drug house,
Jones said.
   Police said Anthony Williams was shot March 15 and died the
following day.
   Jones said he and Cornell Williams were taken to a desolate area
to be killed March 18, but he escaped. Martinez then shot Cornell
Williams twice in the head, police said.
   The jury split in the case of John Garrett, 26, of Philadelphia,
acquitting him in the murder of Anthony Williams and deadlocking in
the case of Cornell. He faces a retrial, Assistant District
Attorney Joseph McGettigan said.
   Kelly Robinson, 17, of New York City, was acquitted.

   _U.S. troops discovered a huge cache of arms in a rented house
near Noriega's family home in an upper-middle class section of
Panama City. Neighbors who tipped off the military said the house
had been rented by Noriega.

   Elena Ceausescu often was praised as
``the best mother of Romania'' and a ``scientist of world fame.''
   Insiders say she was ill-educated, arrogant, had a taste for
furs and expensive jewelry, and referred to ordinary Romanians as
``worms.''
   Official biographies even shaved two years off her age, to make
her one year younger than her husband, Nicolae Ceausescu. Mrs.
Ceausescu actually is 72, a year older than the deposed dictator.
   A member of the Politburo and the virtual second-in-command of
the country, she was one of the dozens of Ceausescu relatives who
held influential positions in the government. She often was at
Ceausescu's side in public.
   They acted much like a royal family, traveling together abroad,
conducting well-staged visits to farms and factories, and making a
regal promenade to greet lined-up guests at state receptions.
   Mrs. Ceausescu was said to be a trained chemist, and works by
her filled Romanian bookstores and were translated into foreign
languages. But they were believed to be ghost-written by other
scientists.
   Gen. Ion Pacepa, chief of Romanian intelligence operations
abroad until 1978 when he defected to the United States, said in a
book published last year that among his duties was to collect
classified technological information to be used in the books by
Mrs. Ceausescu.
   As chairman of the national council for science and education,
Mrs. Ceausescu was in charge of all curricula, from elementary
schools to higher education.
   The Marxist indoctrination and the official adulation amounting
to public worship of the Ceausescus have ``poisoned the soul and
mind of our children and deprived them of the genuine values of
Romanian and universal culture,'' Bucharest Radio quoted a Romanian
writer as saying Sunday.
   Official biographies listed Mrs. Ceausescu as being born in
1919. In fact, she was born in Petresti, a village in southern
Romania, in 1917.
   She met and married her husband when both were teen-age
revolutionaries.
   Her celebrated competence in science was less than genuine.
During her time as director of the Central Institute of Chemical
Research, she took the floor at several national conferences and
meetings but spoke on general matters. Whenever a specific
scientific theme arose, she deferred to a ``Comrade Engineer'' who
then had to explain the details.
   She joined the Communist Party in 1937 in Bucharest where she
worked in a textile factory.
   After Ceausescu's takeover in 1965, she rapidly rose in the
party hierarchy. She was named a member of the party executive
committee in 1973, and also was a member of the Politburo and first
vice premier.
   She once was elected ``queen'' of a workers' parade on May 1,
1939, and Mrs. Ceausescu lived like one once she and her husband
ruled Romania.
   Pacepa said he was ordered to ensure Mrs. Ceausescu could shop
for jewelry whenever she wanted.
   He also said he reported to her once a week with tapes secretly
recorded at the residences of their children _ two sons and a
daughter _ and other high officials, so she could keep tabs on them.
   Romanian TV on Sunday showed footage from one of Ceausescu's
residences, displaying some of her jewelry and Western currency
allegedly prepared in a bag for escape.
   They had a mountain retreat in the Carpathians, a villa at the
Black Se resort of Neptune, and a marble-floored mansion by a lake
on the outskirts of Bucharest. At the time of the uprising, work
was being completed on the huge presidential palace.
   One of her many expensive fur coats was found at the Communist
Party headquarters Friday and paraded in front of photographers
after she and her husband fled the capital by helicopter. They are
both in detention, and awaiting trial.
   Sources close to her entourage said she was cynical, and paid no
attention to the real needs of the 23 million Romanians, whom she
despised.
   ``The worms never get satisfied, regardless of how much food you
give them,'' she was once overheard saying, referring to their
complaints about food shortages that have plagued Romania for a
decade.

   The persistent cold wave gave Florida record lows Sunday, and
stirred up a snowstorm that piled snow in 8-foot drifts in the
Carolinas, but a slight warming trend moved onto the Plains
   Record or record-tying lows were reported for 56 cities from
Texas to Florida and north to New England.
   Temperatures dipped below zero as far south as Tennessee and
freezing temperatures were reported as far south as southern
Florida, where Miami cooled to a record 31 degrees.
   The Florida Keys was the only place in the eastern half of the
country without freezing temperatures from late Saturday into
Sunday morning.
   Sunday's official low for the Lower 48 states was 27 degrees
below zero at Houlton, Maine, with unofficial lows of 33 below zero
reported in the West Virginia mountain valley communities of Glady
and Cheat Bridge.
   Wind blew at 40 to 50 mph along the Outer Banks of North
Carolina, causing considerable blowing and drifting snow and
knocking down power lines. In Hyde County, on the coast of the
mainland, the wind created snow drifts up to 8 feet high.
   Snowfall totals in eastern South Carolina ranged up to 14 inches
at Myrtle Beach, with 8 inches at Charleston.
   Light snow dusted northern Florida, but much of the state got
ice on roads and crops.
   Light snow also dusted the southeastern corner of New England.
   In the central part of the nation, temperatures rose rapidly.
   The temperature hit 40 degrees at Chamberlain, S.D., and
Minneapolis warmed into the 20s after nearly five straight days
below zero. Kansas City, Mo., had a December record of 16 below
zero Saturday, but highs in the 30s and 40s were predicted for
Monday in the region.
   Temperatures even remained above freezing overnight across parts
of the northern Plains. Sunday's low of 33 at Dickinson, N.D., was
66 degrees higher than the city's morning low on Friday.
   Clouds and light snow accompanied the warmer weather from Kansas
and Arkansas to Minnesota and Michigan.

   A group seeking housing for the elderly
used a Christmas tree and its own version of the ``12 days of
Christmas'' to lobby Gov. Steve Cowper for a state ``gift'' of $5.6
million.
   Seniors for Congregate Housing wants the money to build a
40-unit housing complex in Kenai. The city has donated land and
promised to pay for utilities and operation of the complex.
   To get the state to chip in, group members made ornaments
representing an Alaska-style 12-day countdown. They mailed them to
a Juneau senior citizens' group, which delivered them to the
governor's office over the 12 days ending Friday.
   The ornaments depicted:
   ``Twelve seniors humming,
   ``Eleven just for the halibut,
   ``Ten cords of timber,
   ``Nine moose a-prancing,
   ``Eight grizzlies growling,
   ``Seven salmon spawning,
   ``Six derricks pumping,
   ``Five-point-six million dollars for senior housing,
   ``Four gold nuggets,
   ``Three spruce hens,
   ``Two king crabs,
   ``And a drifter in a spruce tree.''
   The drifter refers Cowper himself, who speaks with a drawl, has
a fondness for cowboy boots and is sometimes called Alaska's
``high-plains drifter.''

<HEAD>Embassies Provide Sacrosanct Ground</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Under international law, embassies are sacrosanct ground. An
embassy's territory belongs to the country it represents, not to
the country where it is situated. Forces from the outside cannot
legally enter embassy territory to seize a person the embassy wants
to shelter.
   But an embassy's right to grant sanctuary to someone does not
mean that person has a right to free passage out of the country. A
refugee may have to wait inside the embassy for years until
political conditions permit his departure.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega took refuge Sunday in the papal
nunciate, or Vatican Embassy, in Panama City, and asked for
political asylum. It was not clear what action the Vatican would
take.
   In June, Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi took refuge inside the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing. Although talks since then between U.S. and
Chinese officials have reportedly touched on Fang's case, he
remains holed up in the embassy, liable to arrest if he comes out.
   
   Perhaps the longest instance of political refuge in an embassy
involved Hungarian Cardinal Josef Mindszenty, who hid for 15 years
at the U.S. Embassy in Budapest. He was arrested by Hungary's
Communist rulers in 1948 as an enemy of communism and sentenced to
life in prison.
   Hungarian revolutionaries freed him during the 1956 uprising,
but Mindszenty took refuge in the U.S. mission in Budapest after
Warsaw Pact forces crushed the revolt. He lived there until the
Vatican arranged for his release to the West in 1971.
   Elsewhere in the East bloc, seven Pentecostalists claiming
religious persecution lived for five years in a cramped room at the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow, leaving in 1983.
   
   Thousands of East Germans seeking to go West took refuge in
various West German embassies in September, leading to a
pro-democracy campaign that forced the lifting of travel
restrictions, toppled the Communist government, and ultimately
spread across the East bloc.
   The largest number of people to seek refuge at a foreign embassy
at once may have been in Cuba in April 1980, when 10,000 Cubans
entered the grounds of the Peruvian Embassy seeking to emigrate.
Cuban authorities finally persuaded the crowd to go home, and
eventually almost all of them received exit visas.
   In 1973, after Salvador Allende was overthrown as president of
Chile and died in a battle in the presidential palace, his widow
and her children received refuge in the Mexican Embassy in
Santiago. The Mexican government then flew them out of the country.
   In South Africa, some 20 prisoners and anti-apartheid activists
have taken refuge in the U.S., British, West German and Dutch
diplomatic missions in recent years. Most were eventually allowed
to go free, with South African government assurances that they
would not be punished.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was a
shrewd and ruthless survivor, and it was often said that he would
prefer death to losing power.
   Even after U.S. troops invaded Panama last week, he broadcast a
defiant message from hiding, vowing ``to win or die _ not one step
back.''
   On Sunday, Noriega came out of hiding and sought political
asylum at the Vatican embassy in Panama City.
   During his tenure as ruler of Panama he eliminated political
opposition, nullified the May 7 elections when they were going
against him and repeatedly defied the United States, which indicted
him on drug trafficking charges in February 1988.
   In a speech after the indictments in Floria, Noriega brandished
a machete above his head and slammed it down on the podium, again
using the phrase ``Not one step back!''
   It had long been known that ``Tony'' Noriega enjoyed a crisis
and it was widely said he would prefer death to losing power. He
reveled in thumbing his nose at the United States, which he called
``the colossus of the north.''
   Noriega, who comes from El Chorrillo, the Panama City district
where the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters is located,
created a mystique that won him the nickname ``The Man,'' the
English word his initials spell.
   Noriega wrapped himself in nationalism, saying it was part of
the historic mission of his generation to take control of the
Panama Canal. Under an accord with the United States, Panama is to
take over the canal by the year 2000. Noriega claimed his enemies
were plotting to abrogate the canal pact.
   He said Washington wanted to oust him to make it easier for the
United States to renege on the canal treaties.
   On Oct. 3, elements of the 15,000-man Defense Forces he
commanded rebelled and claimed they had deposed him, but troops
loyal to him suppressed the rebellion and he personally accepted
the rebels' surrender.
   During his last crisis in May after the opposition swamped his
candidate the annulled presidential elections, Noriega was seen
standing alone before the tomb of his patron, Gen. Omar Torrijos.
   The epitaph on the tomb is: ``I don't want to enter heaven. I
just want to enter the Canal Zone.''
   Torrijos, who seized power in a 1968, signed the 1977 accord
with former President Carter to turn over the canal. Torrijos died
in a plane crash in 1981, and Noriega became commander of the
Defense Forces in 1983, giving him de facto control of the
government.
   Noriega was raised by foster parents and joined the Defense
Forces in 1962. His ascent began when he caught the attention of
Torrijos, then an ambitious young officer.
   In his climb to the top, he dealt with everyone from the CIA to
Colombian cocaine cartels.
   Less than a year after Torrijos took power in 1968 coup, he made
Noriega, then an obscure major, chief of intelligence with the rank
of lieutenant colonel.
   It was like having the keys to the city. Noriega immediately
began compiling dossiers on everyone who counted in Panama. The job
also gave him close contact with U.S. intelligence agencies, and he
formed powerful alliances.
   One U.S. official who dealt with Noriega at the time, on drug
enforcement efforts, said Noriega was polite but when it came to
something he wanted, he was ``the coldest man I ever met.''
   After Noriega became the Defense Forces commander, he acquired a
fleet of expensive cars and a home in an exclusive neighborhood.
   His financial interests reportedly included a vast array of
businesses including hotels, casinos, a television station, radio
stations, maritime services, duty-free liquor stores and
prostitution.
   Rumors about his personal life were plentiful, but there were
few facts. Even his age was disputed. The general has said he is
51, but the date in his high school yearbook would make him 54.
   He is married and has a daughter who lives in the Dominican
Republic.
   Although wealthy, he worked hard to develop a populist image
modeled on the revered Torrijos, spending weekends meeting with
residents of towns and villages in this nation of 2.2 million.
   Noriega often speaks of his humble origins and characterizes his
domestic opponents as rich and white. ``The humble, the poor and
the blacks, they are the utmost authority of the people,'' he once
said.
   As the standoff with the United States dragged on, Noriega
enjoyed underlining what he termed Washington's helplessness,
despite the 12,000 troops it stationed in Panama.
   Noriega exercised power with ruthless assurance. He closed
newspapers for months at a time. Presidents served at his pleasure.
   Rumors of opposition inside the Defense Forces were met with
purges and reorganizations. ``Kisses,'' was how he described the
bullets fired in an attempted coup in March 1988.
   The United States, long his ally, began to distance itself after
the headless body of one of his opponents, Hugo Spadadora, was
found in a U.S. mailbag in Costa Rica in 1985.
   A full break came in February 1988, when two federal grand
juries in Florida indicted Noriega on drug-trafficking and
money-laundering charges.
   The domestic opposition began to intensify its campaign against
Noriega and Washington imposed crippling economic sanctions, but
Noriega didn't budge.
   An intelligence source in Washington said that in the months
leading up the October coup attempt, there had been reports of a
deterioration in Noriega's mental state, including increased
paranoia and constant drinking.
   Through his control of the Defense Forces, he was named chief of
    government on Dec. 15 by a rubber-stamp assembly. It said his
leadership was needed to confront a ``state of war'' caused by U.S.
economic sanctions and other efforts to oust the general.

   Pope John Paul II heralded the birth of
Jesus in a Christmas Eve midnight Mass in St. Peter's Basilica
beamed to millions on television.
   ``I bring you good news of a great joy,'' John Paul said,
opening his homily quoting from Luke. ``To you is born this day a
Savior.''
   Pilgrims and tourists packed St. Peter's, the largest church in
Christendom, and the pope greeted ``all people, on every
continent'' who listened on radio or watched on television.
   The Vatican said it expected the Mass to be televised to about
50 countries, including John Paul's native Poland, the Soviet
Union, Hungary and _ for the first time _ East Germany.
   Earlier, in an interview broadcast by Italy's state-run RAI-TV,
the pope praised the wave of democracy sweeping Eastern Europe,
lamenting only that the bloodshed in Romania at Christmas time was
a ``sad and painful'' exception.
   ``But it's a step in the same process. (It is) the past and the
future of our continent.''
   He called the European events ``extraordinary'' and said Eastern
Europeans who suffered as a result of World War II were ``finally
emerging as winners.''
   John Paul began his Christmas activities blessing a
100-foot-high tree from Austria and a nativity scene with life-size
figures in the center of St. Peter's Square at noon on Sunday. He
said Christmas eve was a ``wait full of hope as we prepare to
welcome Christ who comes to us as savior of the world.''
   In brief remarks, he said that while wars, rivalries, arrogance
and selfishness were obstacles to peace, ``the optimism of hope is
not naive.''
   Later, in his homily, the pope said, ``On this Bethlehem night
all of us are called _ once again _ to rejoice in the work of
creation.''
   ``The church, which on this night proclaims `a great joy,' knows
that this joy comes completely from God. It is the gift of his
love,'' the pope said.
   On Christmas, the pope will celebrate another Mass in St.
Peter's and then deliver his traditional message ``Urbi et Orbi'' _
Latin for ``to the city (of Rome) and the world.''

<TEXT>
   In groups or alone, with or
without their weapons, members of the Panamanian Defense Forces are
surrendering.
   Even before ousted dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega went to
the Vatican embassy Sunday to ask for political asylum, hundreds of
his troops were giving up the fight.
   The baseball field at Rodman Naval Station, on the west bank of
the Panama Canal, is one of several detention centers the U.S.
military has set up to process those who turn themselves in or are
captured.
   About 1,400 surrendered or were caught in the first 24 hours of
the U.S. invasion early Wednesday. They continue to trickle in, and
more than 100 have passed through Rodman by Sunday.
   They sit in brightly colored tents on the baseball field,
waiting to be questioned and sent elsewhere for processing. The
barbed wire and police dogs are reminders that it's a war, not a
picnic.
   ``They tell us what they have to say and we make a
determination,'' said Eugene Richley, the master-at-arms in charge
of the center. He said some of those who appear at the gate are
refugees and some are allowed to stay on the base if they are
perceived to be in danger.
   ``But most just walk up to a checkpoint. They appear friendly,''
he said.
   Richley said most are former members of the Defense Forces who
expressed interest in joining a new security force being formed
under President Guillermo Endara. He said these men are being
screened further.
   Col. Roberto Armijo, who switched allegiance from Noriega to
Endara and was put in charge of the new police corps, appealed
Saturday to the former Defense Forces members to join the new
government and re-establish harmony ``as soon as possible.''
   ``I ask all members of the Defense Forces to come to the nearest
garrison,'' he said.
   Vice President and Interior Minister Ricardo Arias Calderon, the
man in charge of domestic security, said he holds ``no rancor or
desire for revenge'' against the military under Noriega.
   ``I offer you the absolute respect of the civilian authority but
we have the right to demand that you be loyal to your oath,'' Arias
added. He asked for reconciliation.
   Naval and Marine officers said those suspected of being
criminals or looters are kept in jail.
   A Marine Corps spokesman, Chief Warrant Officer Charles Rowe,
said Panamanians are held if they are caught in combat with U.S.
forces, if they give themselves up, or if they are turned in by
people believed to be reliable.
   ``Most of them just walked up to a checkpoint and say they want
to avoid more problems,'' Richley said. He said the ``detainees'' _
the U.S. military here is not using the term ``prisoner of war'' _
are treated in accord with the Geneva Convention.
   Those who surrender their arms along with themselves receive a
bonus, depending on the weapons. The United States is paying $150
for an automatic rifle, a princely sum to many Panamanians.
   Government TV runs a message on the screen almost constantly
notifying watchers of ``Passports to Freedom'' _ U.S.-issued
documents given to people who turn themselves in. The announcement
said the ``passports'' assure the bearer of safety, food, medical
attention and, eventually, another job.
   ``Remember: You don't have to suffer any more,'' the message
concludes.
   At the U.S. military's westernmost checkpoint on the Pan
American Highway, about 15 miles west of the capital, Marine Lt.
Dan Krauss of Portland, Ore., said several members of the Defense
Forces had presented themselves, including one lieutenant with his
Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifle, a pistol and all of his uniforms.
   ``He said his people _ there were about 25 men _ wanted to give
up. He told us that they had waited a long time for this, that they
were just laying low in their barracks,'' Kraus said.
   ``He had a full seabag issue of uniforms. It was clear that he
didn't want to resist,'' he added.
   Krauss said three soldiers surrendered before the U.S. takeover
began.
   ``We understand there was already some shooting, and they didn't
think that was a very good idea,'' he said, adding that the three
eventually were freed.
   Krauss said dozens of residents have given information as to
where to find Rigoberto Paredes, a Noriega crony and former member
of Panama's National Assembly who owned much of the property in the
area and wielded power ruthlessly.

   Two military hospitals treating more than 100
soldiers who suffered wounds while fighting in Panama were
festooned with holiday decorations on Christmas Eve, as gifts
poured in from around the country.
   ``Everybody's been sending them Christmas cards, flowers and
fruit baskets,'' said Senior Airman Cynthia Fontenot of Lackland
Air Force Base, where Wilford Hall Medical Center is located.
``There's cases of cookies, potato chips, chocolate candies,
shaving cream, razors and different things.''
   Twenty-five injured Army Rangers returned to Fort Lewis, Wash.
Thirty more GI's were treated at a Fort Bragg Army hospital Sunday,
bringing to 67 the number of servicemen brought back to North
Carolina in time for the holidays.
   ``The wounds are not that serious. We're able to pretty quickly
give them treatment,'' said Fort Bragg spokesman Doug Foster.
``Their morale is good.''
   In San Antonio, 65 patients wounded in Panama were being treated
at Wilford Hall and Brooke Army Medical Center across town at Fort
Sam Houston was treating 47 soldiers, officials said.
   Cooks at both hospitals began preparing a traditional Christmas
meal for the patients.
   The soldiers' relatives have been treated to free lodging and
rental cars from local companies, Sgt. Maj. Raymond Morris said at
Brooke.
   ``All this is really unsolicited. We have asked for nothing and
we have received so many things,'' Morris said.
   About 20 families have used an assistance center at Brooke, he
said.
   At Saturday night's San Antonio Spurs basketball game, the
city's Chamber of Commerce asked for donations of sweatshirts and
tennis shoes for the soldiers. The number donated could not
immediately be determined and chamber officials did not return a
phone call Sunday.
   Since Wednesday, 244 soldiers have been flown to San Antonio in
seven transport planes. The latest were 11 patients flown in
Sunday. Three died en route and one died after arriving. Dozens
have been transferred to other military hospitals or released to
their units, officials said.
   At Fort Bragg, the original estimate of 3,000 soldiers from that
base still in Panama by Christmas Eve had been revised to 4,000.
   At Fort Lewis, one soldier, a foot in a cast, was asked how his
mission in Panama City had gone. He smiled, and yelled back, ``It
was great!''
   ``To a man, they all want to get well and get back to their
units,'' said Lt. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller, commander of Fort Lewis
and I Corps, who shook each soldier's hand as they returned. ``They
are outstanding young Americans.''
   Most of the injuries sustained by the members of the 2nd Ranger
Battalion, 75th Regiment, were to the lower back and legs, caused
from parachuting from C-141 transport planes at an altitude below
500 feet to avoid being detected by radar, said Capt. Martin
Eckert, Fort Lewis spokesman.
   ``If they are considered to be fully recovered and forces are
still needed in Panama, the soldiers would probably be sent back
down,'' Eckert said.

   The foreign minister Sunday offered to help put
together a ``brigade of volunteers'' to help Romanians fight forces
loyal to ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   If the Soviet Union thought it necessary to intervene in Romania
on the side of the anti-Ceausescu forces, France ``not only would
not object to it, but would support this action,'' Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas told Soviet officials.
   There was no indication, however, of imminent military
intervention by Soviet or other forces. Soviet Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov said Saturday that sending the Red Army to Romania would be
``impermissible'' and a repetition of past mistakes.
   In a later interview Sunday on French TV, Dumas said the Soviets
``have just now let us know today that they are in agreement to
begin with us to coordinate all our aid.''
   He did not elaborate, but it was clear he meant humanitarian,
rather than military aid.
   The French army said it will provide 10 trucks and 30 soldiers
to help deliver medical aid to Romania.
   In a short statement Sunday, the Foreign Ministry said France
recognizes the National Salvation Committee as the legal authority
in Romania.
   So far, France has only been asked for humanitarian aid, but it
stands ready to respond if asked to go beyond humanitarian
measures, Dumas said on French radio.
   ``If other requests are made _ I don't know how the events will
unfold _ if another demand is made, we will appraise it. I can tell
you we are ready to respond to any new situation,'' he said.
   The foreign minister then added, ``Myself, I could very well see
the constitution of a brigade of volunteers. France could help in
it.''
   Interviewed by Agence France-Presse, Dumas recalled the
volunteers who participated in the Spanish Civil War and in the
liberation of France from Nazi occupation in 1944.
   ``Many people talk, but don't take enough action,'' he said.
   In an interview on French TV, however, Dumas said Western
participation in military intervention in Romania ``would pose
problems, because the region is a zone of the Warsaw Pact.''
   Romanian-born playwright Eugene Ionesco, who lives in France,
urged the West ``to provide military aid in arms and ammunition to
the regular Romanian army so it can defend the people against the
agents of the security police.''
   France has sent two planeloads of medical supplies and emergency
medical teams to Romania in a mission led by Bernard Kouchner,
minister for humanitarian action in the Socialist government.

   President Bush had just returned from a
Pentagon briefing on the situation in Panama on Christmas Eve when
he learned that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega had sought refuge from
Vatican authorities.
   Bush had interrupted his holiday vacation to fly by helicopter
from the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., for 90 minutes of
briefings from Pentagon officials on Panama, and he had called Gen.
Maxwell Thurman, commander of the U.S. Southern Command in Panama.
   At the time, he said he had no idea when U.S. troops might
accomplish one of the key goals for their invasion of Panama early
Wednesday, the capture of the deposed Panamanian dictator who is
under U.S. indictment on drug-trafficking charges.
   ``If I knew that, why both of us would be a lot smarter,'' Bush
told reporters after the Pentagon sessions.
   Just a few hours later, Thurman announced in Panama City that
Noriega was at the Papal Nunciate there and was seeking asylum.
   Bush, through White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, announced
a few minutes later, ``I am pleased that the general is now under
the control of diplomatic authorities. His reign of terror is
over.''
   It was not immediately clear whether the U.S. government would
be able to bring him to the United States to stand trial. The
Italian news agency ANSA quoted the papal nuncio in Panama City,
Monignor Sebastiano Laboa, as indicating he would not hand over
Noriega to the United States or U.S.-installed government in Panama.
   After the Pentagon sessions earlier Sunday, Bush told reporters
outside the Pentagon that ``the emphasis now is on cleaning up the
last parts of resistance, seeing that civilian government take
over, (restoring) tranquility in the city and then moving on food
and medicine.''
   Noting the holiday, Bush said he wanted to express ``my
gratitude to the fine military officers and men who are taking part
in this operation. It's been outstanding.''
   ``I must say that the military, having fulfilled a major
objective _ knocking out the Panamanian Defense Forces almost
entirely _ is now putting a great deal of proper emphasis on
humanitarian concerns,'' he said.
   Bush said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was on his way to
Panama, where the president said a ``real turnaround'' had occurred
in restoring order.
   ``It's a very good pre-Christmas report that I have received,''
Bush said after his briefing by Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, and national security advisor Scowcroft.
   Bush also commented briefly on the tumult in Romania, saying he
had just spoken to the U.S. ambassador in Bucharest.
   He called the events there ``a very traumatic pre-Christmas
uprising'' but said it appeared that pro-democracy forces, which
include the nation's army, appeared to be gaining ground.
   He said the Romanian military had gained ``a little more
control'' of the country in fighting with remnants of the secret
police, who remain loyal to deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   While at the Pentagon, Bush taped a radio message to U.S. troops
around the globe, offering a ``special salute'' to those in Panama
and a tribute to U.S. servicemen who died in the fighting there.
   ``In Panama, as in every other such test in our history,
Americans put their lives on the line for the basic values of
liberty and decency on which our nation is founded,'' he said.
   ``Our hearts and those of every American go out to the families
of those who fell. To all those who mourn a husband, a son, a
brother, a father or a friend, I can only offer the thanks of a
grateful nation. Your loved ones served a noble and just cause with
honor and distinction.''

   Manuel Antonio Noriega is the perfect villain
_ but there are drawbacks in a policy heavily hinged on the capture
of one man, whatever his crimes.
   One nagging administration problem was resolved on Christmas Eve
when Noriega turned himself in to Vatican diplomats in Panama City,
seeking asylum.
   In power and in hiding, the Panamanian strongman had been
taunting the United States for nearly three years.
   That dilemma was resolved Sunday night, after a five-day U.S.
manhunt in Panama, complete with a million dollar bounty.
   The U.S. commander in Panama, then the White House announced
that Noriega had turned up and turned himself in, not to U.S.
forces but to envoys of the Roman Catholic church.
   The White House said ``the demise of General Noriega'' was a
signal that the forces of democracy and freedom in Panama were on
the rise.
   Noriega apologists are certain to note that he was not captured
and did not surrender to the American troops sent to Panama.
They'll call it sanctuary, not surrender.
   It also leaves open the question of whether Noriega ever will
stand trial on U.S. drug indictments.
   But those are technicalities; the administration already had
indicated a willingness to spare him prosecution if he would yield
power and get out of Panama.
   And it hardly seems likely that a man like Noriega would have
surrendered himself even to the sanctuary of the church had his
position not become impotent and impossible.
   Noriega had slipped away when the U.S. intervened early last
Wednesday and had eluded American forces for five days as the most
wanted of men.
   The plot in the Panama story has taken bizarre turns before, and
the crafty, elusive target of a manhunt ordered by the White House
could have gained a sort of a perverse popularity among some Latin
Americans had he remained at large, evading the Yankees.
   The United States posted a $1 million bounty for information
leading to his arrest. President Bush said he wouldn't be satisfied
until Noriega was brought to justice.
   Noriega's capture was a major objective from the moment the
American troops moved in at 1 a.m. last Wednesday.
   ``His picture will be in every post office in town,'' Bush said
Thursday. ``That's the way it works. He is a fugitive drug dealer
and we want to see him brought to justice.''
   Noriega's pockmarked face, brandished machete and defiance of
his own countrymen when they voted for his opponents all add to the
image of the prototype dictator. U.S. officials say there is
evidence he meant to attack unarmed American civilians, that he was
involved in voodoo or Satanism, that he admired Adolf Hitler, that
he plotted a terrorist takeover of the Panama Canal.
   Overall, hardly a sympathetic figure.
   But there was a risk in a superpower policy centered on one man,
even a man such as Noriega.
   The White House bounty had made him a million-dollar man.
American troops by the thousands couldn't take him, although the
likelihood is that unless they had been closing in, Noriega would
not have turned in his hand.
   One man against all that might was one man who could become a
Latin legend, as outlaws sometimes do.
   Noriega's decision to seek refuge with Vatican authorities
should ease the crisis in Panama; he and his henchmen prolonged the
agony with sniping, raids, looting, urban guerrilla warfare. Had he
escaped to sanctuary with his Nicaraguan allies, it could have
pointed to a war of words, even raids, against the new government
in Panama.
   Now that danger has eased.
   Stripped of power and confined to an embassy sanctuary, Noriega
should fade to insignificance.
   In the first Pentagon briefing on the Panama operation, Gen.
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Noriega
had been decapitated as the leader of Panama. ``Yesterday's maximum
leader is today's fugitive,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said later.
   Bush said Thursday that Noriega ``controls no forces, and he's
out.''
   If all of that is so, and Noriega is powerless, his arrest would
seem a side issue, one that could wait.
   The capture of that one, elusive fugitive had remained a major,
declared objective in the biggest military operation since the
United States withdrew from South Vietnam.
   He wasn't captured by the Americans who sought him, but he is no
longer at large. And that is a major break for the Bush
administration.

   Disruptions of everything from bus
service to church services made life a chore Sunday while this
northeastern Florida river city fought record cold and treacherous
ice.
   ``It's a winter wonderland in Jacksonville. It's a beautiful
sight for a city that doesn't get snow very often, and it's also a
very dangerous situation for the same reason,'' said Mayor Tommy
Hazouri.
   Throughout late Saturday and early Sunday, most of
Jacksonville's bridges were closed to traffic. Police responded to
dozens of traffic accidents, most fender-benders from skidding cars.
   For the first time since Hurricane Dora in 1964, the
Jacksonville Transportation Authority suspended bus service.
   Worrying that heavy use of electricity might force power
reductions to some neighborhoods, electric utility officials asked
that outdoor Christmas lights and hot water heaters be shut off.
   ``That may not sound like much, but if you multiply that several
thousand times ... it can make a difference,'' said Clyde
Montgomery, a spokesman for the Jacksonville Electric Authority.
   The authority had a record for power use for the year Saturday
at 2,100 megawatts, Montgomery said.
   Interstate 10 between Jacksonville and Tallahassee was closed
for hours.
   All flights were cancelled at Jacksonville International Airport
on Saturday and Sunday.
   Many passengers were stranded while carrying colorfully wrapped
Christmas packages intended for friends and relatives elsewhere.
   Some hospitals were short on nurses because many could not get
to work.
   Numerous churches canceled Sunday's regular and special
Christmas Eve services.
   An 8-year-old boy died after a malfunctioning kerosene heater
started a fire in a bedroom where he, his mother and three other
children were sleeping, authorities said.
   Cindy Mosling, operator of BEAKS, a bird emergency care center,
said she had received more than 100 calls from people who had
sighted birds injured by the cold and ice.
   However, icy bridges to her bird sanctuary prevented her from
rescuing any of the birds.

   The temperature was only 40 and the
wind was blowing, but Sunday's record cold was accompanied by good
waves that attracted die-hard surfers.
   ``It's not often to find waves that big,'' said Paul
Meccariello, 27. ``It's something to do with the weather. Usually
the big waves are blocked by the Bahamas Islands.''
   More than 50 surfers clad in insulating wetsuits gathered in the
67-degree water waiting for good waves. Earlier in the day, Miami
had cooled to a record low of just 31 degrees.
   Meccariello couldn't estimate how high the waves were. There
were swells that appeared several feet high in a small area.
   He had called a recorded surf report from his home in Hollywood,
Fla.
   ``They said this was the spot to be. This is where they're
breaking,'' he said. ``I guess they all called there, too,'' he
said of the other surfers.
   In spite of the good surf, Ben Alloche, 17, was going home.
``It's too crowded,'' he said.
   It was too cold to work on a tan, so tourists with coats
buttoned and hands thrust into their pockets watched the surfers
from the beach.
   Marcus Lemmler, 23, arrived Thursday from Switzerland, which he
said has had record high temperatures.
   ``There's no snow in Switzerland, so we came to Miami to find
it,'' he laughed.

   Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney arrived in Panama on Sunday to share Christmas dinner with
U.S. troops and celebrate Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's decision to
seek asylum.
   ``I am delighted that General Noriega has finally been run to
ground,'' said Cheney after being told, as his plane approached
Panama, that Noriega had sought political asylum at the Vatican
Embassy.
   ``I think it is clear at this point that the Panamanian people
have no use for him, that he has had to take sanctuary in a foreign
embassy,'' said Cheney.
   He spoke to reporters shortly after his plane landed at Howard
Air Force Base four miles west of Panama City.
   ``He no longer is a factor in Panama. Now it is up to the
lawyers and the diplomats to figure out what is next,'' Cheney
said. ``As far as I'm concerned, the military has done its job.''
   Although there were 26,000 U.S. military personnel in Panama,
there were none around the embassy when Noriega arrived there. An
informed military source said Noriega, the ousted Panamanian
strongman, drove himself or was driven to the embassy at about 3
p.m. and entered unaccompanied.
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, said
he ordered the embassy surrounded afterward because ``I have the
security responsibility for all of Panama, so I don't want digbats
(Dignity Battalions loyal to Noriega) blowing into the place. I
would not want them to come with an armored car and blow their way
into the embassy.''
   ``I can imagine all the Vatican lawyers are going to be up at
this hour,'' he added.
   It was unclear whether Noriega's decision will hasten the
withdrawal of U.S. troops from Panama, said Col. Miguel Monteverde,
a Pentagon spokesman. Military officials hoped Noriega's decision
to seek asylum would ``take the spirit to resist'' out of scattered
Noriega loyalists who were still fighting, Monteverde said.
   Cheney went to Panama to ``spend Christmas with troops in the
field ... and of course to celebrate'' Noriega's surrender,
Monteverde said.
   ``He is very interested in how they're doing, but I think he
wants to show in a very real way that he appreciates their
sacrifice in giving up Christmas and putting themselves in harm's
way,'' Monteverde said.
   Cheney will return to Washington either Monday evening or
Tuesday morning, Monteverde said.
   President Bush announced the surprise Cheney trip after a
briefing at the Pentagon on Sunday, the fifth day of the U.S.
invasion that drove Noriega from power.

   Hundreds of bundled-up but jubilant
demonstrators, chanting ``Freedom'' and ``Victory,'' rallied in a
downtown plaza Sunday to show their support for democratic change
in Romania.
   ``Death to the communist regime and the security forces and all
the rest of the bandits,'' said Ionel Mikleu, who emigrated from
Romania 20 years ago. ``They ruled Romania for 40-some years. It's
enough.''
   The crowd, estimated by police at 500, waved Romania's flag with
the communist emblem torn out, burned portraits of deposed dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, and sang the country's national anthem.
   Earlier Sunday, hundreds more Chicagoans with Eastern European
roots wore black armbands at church services for victims of the
turmoil in Romania.
   In New York, about 200 people demonstrated across the street
from the Romanian Mission to the United Nations.
   Princess Margaret, daughter of exiled King Michael, told the
crowd in English of her support for the popular movement in
Romania, then said ``Thank you'' in Romanian, according to the Rev.
Aurel Radulescu, head of the coalition Romania 21.
   Romania 21 has organized daily demonstrations outside the
mission since the uprising in Romania began, more recently to
celebrate and appeal for international aid.
   In Portland, Ore., more than 125 people gathered in downtown
Pioneer Square to sing Christmas carols and light Christmas
candles. Three men held high a Romanian flag.
   ``We want to express our joy at the freedom,'' said John Pirva,
who has lived in Portland for the past eight years.
   One man held a sign with a picture of Ceausescu captioned
``Wanted for Mass Murder,'' referring to the massacre of thousands
of protesters in Timisoara, Romania, last weekend.
   Romania's massive protests began Dec. 15 in Timisoara. The
protests spread to Bucharest, forcing Ceausescu to flee his palace
Friday.
   The revolt was sparked when ethnic Hungarians in Timisoara
rallied to the defense of Presbyterian-Calvinist minister Laszlo
Tokes, who was about to be deported for preaching in his native
Hungarian tongue.
   During the afternoon rally in single-digit temperatures at
Chicago's Daley Center Plaza, demonstrators carried signs reading,
``Make my day _ kill a dictator today'' and ``Ceausescu = Murder.''
Others called for U.S. military aid to partisans battling with
security forces loyal to Ceausescu.
   ``If the State Department would permit us to go there we would
have a battalion ready,'' said Mikleu, a history professor at
Oakton College in suburban Des Plaines.
   Speakers attempting to address the rally could not be heard
above the chanting crowd.
   At the morning mass at St. Stephen King of Hungary Church,
parishoners mourned the deaths of ethnic Hungarians and others in
the violence that has engulfed Romania since last weekend.
   ``I hope that this will bring about a more democratic society
with freedom of speech and religion where people can practice their
own culture and language,'' said Gabriel Pataky, a member of the
congregation.
   The 250 worshipers expressed hope that any new regime in Romania
would respect the rights of the 2 million ethnic Hungarians in the
country.
   ``To replace one repressive regime with another repressive
regime doesn't benefit anyone,'' Pataky said.
   The Hungarians were joined by representatives of other East
European ethnic groups, including Romanians, Poles and Ukrainians,
who pledged their support for democratic change.
   ``We're here as proof of our intentions of cooperation among our
peoples,'' said Vasile Bouleanu, a Romanian.
   Chicago Alderman Roman Pucinski, a leader of the Polish
community, praised the Romanians who stood up to Ceausescu's
security forces.
   ``What we are witnessing today is that people power is the
greatest power in the world,'' Pucinski said. ``We are hopeful that
it won't be long before all the nations in the world will be able
to live in freedom and dignity.''
   One man held a sign with a picture of Ceausescu, captioned
``Wanted for Mass Murder,'' referring to the massacre of thousands
of protesters in Timisoara, Romania, last weekend.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega sought refuge at the Vatican embassy Sunday after five days
on the run, and he requested political asylum to evade U.S. troops
sent to capture him.
   As word spread that Noriega had surfaced, hundreds of people
converged on the two-story embassy, which was surrounded by U.S.
troops and armored vehicles. A helicopter hovered overhead. Some
young men yelled that Noriega should be lynched.
   Although U.S. officials expressed relief and pleasure, Noriega's
move may have thwarted a main purpose of the invasion launched last
week: the capture of the elusive leader so he could stand trial in
the United States on drug charges.
   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted the papal nuncio in Panama
City, Monignor Sebastiano Laboa, as indicating he would not hand
over Noriega to the United States or U.S.-installed government in
Panama.
   Sources familiar with the situation said the papal nuncio had
mentioned to other diplomats the possibility of Noriega going to
Spain or Cuba.
   The papal nuncio is the Vatican's diplomatic representative in
Panama, and under international law, embassies are sacrosanct
ground.
   Word that the elusive Noriega had resurfaced came first from
Gen. Maxwell Thurman, chief of the U.S. Southern Command. President
Bush announced later in Washington that Noriega had surrendered and
``his reign of terror is over.''
   Noriega turned himself in just hours after three high-ranking
members of his army surrendered and another pledged loyalty to the
U.S.-backed government.
   In a dispatch from Panama City, ANSA quoted unidentified sources
as saying Noriega sought political asylum to negotiate his transfer
to another country.
   The report also said there were 32 people in the embassy,
formally known as the papal nunciatura, including high officials of
the Panamanian Defense Forces and political parties of the Noriega
regime.
   The Rev. Joseph Esspeteri, the nuncio's secretary, confirmed
that Noriega was at the embassy but refused to say whether he had
been granted asylum or anything else on his status. Vatican
Secretary of State Agostino Casaroli, leaving midnight Mass at St.
Peter's Basilica in Rome, declined to comment on Noriega's action.
   Noriega's move appeared to put the Vatican in a delicate
position, with a choice of offending the United States by refusing
to turn Noriega over or appearing to condone the U.S. invasion by
doing so.
   ``It's a very complex problem,'' said a senior Vatican official
early Monday. The official, who works in foreign policy issues and
spoke under the usual ground rule of anonymity, noted that the
Vatican has no tradition or policy of accepting asylum seekers.
   ``I don't think they could directly hand Noriega over to the
Americans, who are an invading army,'' the official said. ``They
would be recognizing the Americans as the local authorities.
Instead, they could hand him over to the government there on
condition of a fair trial.''
   Noriega arrived by car at the embassy about 3 p.m., said an
informed military source. At the time, there were no U.S. troops
around the building, which occupies about half a city block in a
well-to-do Paitilla neighborhood.
   Witnesses said they saw several former officials of the
Noriega-controlled government entering the Vatican Embassy this
afternoon, including Manuel Solis Palma, who was acting president
on Sept. 1.
   In Panama City, shattered after five days of fighting between
U.S. troops and Noriega loyalists, people banged pots and pans
together, cheered and honked horns when they heard the news about
Noriega.
   ``Now we can have Christmas!' said one man, who grabbed a friend
and hugged him. ``I don't have a turkey in the house, we don't even
have any hamburger. All we have is a can of sardines, but what the
hell!''
   ``Is it true?'' yelled a woman on a balcony. She squealed with
delight when told it was.
   ``Mission accomplished,'' said a passing cab driver. ``That
coward.''
   Noriega had been at large since U.S. troops invaded Panama at
midnight Tuesday in an effort to capture him. The Bush
administration offered a $1 million bounty for the military
strongman.
   Ironically, opposition leader Guillermo Endara, installed as
president shortly after the invasion, obtained shelter at the papal
nuncio's residence in October after being beaten and thrown out of
his office by Noriega's soldiers.
   There was no immediate comment from the Vatican. There was no
answer at the phone number of Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro in
Vatican City.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who flew to Panama, said he
was ``delighted'' at the news on Noriega.
   ``He no longer is a factor in Panama,'' Cheney said. ``Now it is
up to the lawyers and the diplomats to figure out what is next. As
far as I'm concerned, the military has done its job.''
   Thurman said he had the embassy surrounded because ``I have the
security responsibility for all of Panama, so I don't want (Dignity
Battalions) blowing into the place. I would not want them to come
with an armored car and blow their way into the embassy.''
   The 26,000-member U.S. force, bolstered by reinforcements sent
in Saturday, made headway earlier Sunday in its fight to put down
the resistance of Noriega holdouts after three high-ranking members
of Noriega's army surrendered and another pledged loyalty to the
U.S.-backed government.
   U.S. authorities said about 1,800 of Noriega's original 15,000
Defense Force members were still fighting U.S. troops. It was not
immediately clear how Noriega's move Sunday would affect them.
   Since the invasion, 25 U.S. soldiers and two American civilians
have been killed, according to the Pentagon. One soldier was
missing, and 281 were wounded, U.S. officials said.
   The U.S. military said 154 Panamanian soldiers had died, 113
were wounded, and 2,969 had been captured.
   Dr. Elmer Miranda, director of Santo Tomas Hospital, put the
Panamanian death toll at 260 and said many victims were civilians.
   Many families in the capital of 1 million had nothing to give
their children on the usually joyous holiday in this predominantly
Roman Catholic nation.
   ``What am I going to tell my 6-year-old daughter? I cannot tell
her Santa Claus was killed by a bomb,'' said one woman in a
middle-class neighborhood.
   A few Christmas lights twinkled in some homes, but most shops
and supermarkets were looted bare. Food and medical supplies were
dwindling, and officials were arranging to fly in fresh supplies.
   ``Three more looting days until Christmas,'' observed one
visitor.
   Many neighborhoods formed groups to clean up streets littered
with glass and trash and put up Christmas lights.
   ``We have to forge ahead and not be thinking this country is
sinking without a chance to make a better future,'' said a man who
lost about $100,000 when his furniture store was looted.
   At his first presidential news conference Sunday, Endara said he
wished the ``foreign army'' could leave soon but that it probably
would take Panama longer to return to normal.
   ``I wish it were a month,'' he said. ``But I don't think so. I
do not know when.''
   Col. Luis del Cid, a key military commander charged with drug
smuggling along with Noriega, said he would turn himself in to U.S.
military authorities because he was worried about the safety of his
10 children.
   Del Cid, commander of the 5th Military Zone in the provincial
capital of David about 200 miles outside Panama City, had ordered
David's airfield blown up Wednesday to prevent the landing of
American aircraft. He said he would surrender when U.S. troops
reached the city.
   Noriega, Del Cid and 14 others were indicted on drug charges in
U.S. federal court in Miami in February 1988.
   Also Sunday, Lt. Col. Daniel Delgado, Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon
and Lt. Col. Carlos Arosemena turned themselves in to U.S. troops
in Panama City.
   U.S. troops discovered a cache of arms in a rented house near
Noriega's family home in an upper-middle class section of the city.
Found were 300 G-3 rifles, 72,000 rounds of ammunition, at least
360 concussion grenades, about 300 AK-47 assault rifles with 20,000
rounds of ammunition and 30 light anti-tank weapons.
   Neighbors said the house had been rented by Noriega, said Sgt.
John Stowe.
   The house was sparsely furnished with two bunkbeds, a sofa, TV
and VCR with a supply of tapes including two copies of ``Rambo
III,'' ``Tougher Than Leather,'' ``Messenger of Death,'' ``Midnight
Run'' and ``Going Undercover.''

<TEXT>
   An attorney representing deposed Panamanian leader
Manuel Antonio Noriega said Sunday there was little chance he would
be returned to the United States for trial on drug charges.
   Noriega ended an intense manhunt Sunday when he drove to the
Vatican's mission in Panama City and asked for sanctuary. It
remained unclear that night what the Vatican's response would be.
   ``I'm really quite surprised. I was sure he'd die in Panama,''
said Raymond Takiff, Noriega's attorney in Miami. ``Honest to God,
I am really surprised. I'm glad he's alive.''
   Takiff said he tried without success to contact Noriega on
Sunday, but an ambassador from a third country arranged for them to
speak by phone early Christmas morning.
   Takiff said the papal embassy is so well known as a sanctuary in
Panama that he found it hard to believe Noriega could arrive there
unobserved.
   ``Maybe it was a setup, that U.S. troops would look the other
way,'' Takiff said.
   The attorney said he doubted the Vatican would turn Noriega over
to the United States.
   ``The Roman Catholic Church has been sanctuary forever,'' he
said. ``An individual who comes to seek sanctuary will be given
sanctuary. That goes back to the very roots of the Catholic
church.''
   Takiff said prosecuting Noriega, who has a long association with
the Central Intelligence Agency, would reveal so much sensitive
information about U.S. foreign policy that a trial is unlikely.
   ``I've always said they will never want to try him. I always
thought the only option was to kill him,'' Takiff said. ``I never
was clever enough to think of sanctuary in the Vatican. In either
event, he doesn't get tried.''

   There's no Christmas tree to brighten Jesse
Crabtree's living room, and the disabled coal miner has no holiday
cheer this season.
   ``He says, `Why get a tree if we don't have any gifts to put
under it?''' said Crabtree's wife, Edith.
   Crabtree, 68, suffers from black lung disease _ caused by
breathing coal dust _ and has been hospitalized for two heart
attacks and prostate gland surgery. He also was hurt in a 1976
mining accident and now spends his retirement money on medicine
rather than Christmas.
   ``Now, Jesse just sits there in the bedroom, day in and day out,
looking out the window. That's his life,'' Mrs. Crabtree said.
   Crabtree blamed their economic plight on the bitter battle
between the United Mine Workers and the Pittston Coal Group Inc. A
union poster is taped to the wall near his bed.
   Nearly 1,700 miners struck Pittston's coal subsidiary in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky on April 5, after working 14
months without a contract. The walkout was prompted by Pittston's
refusal to participate in an industry agreement on how to fund
costly miners' retirement and health plans.
   The UMW and Pittston failed Saturday in a last-ditch effort to
reach a pre-Christmas settlement. Negotiations recessed with an
agreement that both sides would return to the bargaining table
Wednesday.
   Mrs. Crabtree said she and her husband get $911 a month through
retirement benefits and black lung program payments. Their mortgage
and medical bills alone exceed that.
   ``We're making it from hand to mouth. We're poor but we're
proud,'' Mrs. Crabtree said. ``We had a little bit of savings put
away.''
   For a while, the couple's Christmas dinner was uncertain.
   ``I don't even know if I'm going to have a turkey or a ham,''
Mrs. Crabtree said just before the president of a UMW local arrived
with a 15-pound turkey.
   ``She said she needed a turkey for Christmas. I told her it
would be no trouble,'' said Bethel Purkey from UMW Local 5815.
   Crabtree is upset Pittston changed its pensioner health policy.
After the old contract ran out, the policy began providing 80
percent coverage after a $200 deductible. It had been 100 percent.
   ``Pittston owes him and should pay his medical bills. They are
the ones that caused his problems,'' his wife said.
   Pittston spokeswoman Susan Copeland said 80 percent coverage is
a nationwide standard.
   Cheryl van Tilburg, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross-Blue Shield in
Chicago, the nation's largest health insurer, said ``80-20 is
definitely the norm for group coverage.''
   Crabtree, a union miner for more than 37 years, also is upset
the UMW worked for Pittston for 14 months without a contract. He
said it's possible the company would have continued full coverage
for pensioners if a contract had been reached.
   ``If they had gone on strike then, they'd have a contract now,''
Crabtree said. ``No contract, no work. If a fellow (strike breaker)
wanted to go on in, you keep him from going. You can't have anyone
going in while others are staying out.''
   Mrs. Crabtree said a 100 percent health plan would give her one
less thing to worry about.
   ``I'm 4 feet, 11 inches tall. He's 230-some pounds and I handle
him alone,'' she said. ``I take him to the doctor alone, pull the
car up to the garage. Don't ask me how I do it.''
   One way she does it is by letting Christmas pass virtually
unnoticed.
   ``He needs me and he knows I'll be there,'' Mrs. Crabtree said.
``Mister, I'll never let him down.''

   The holidays are prime time for the
nation's retailers, but they're also high season for the
storeowners' nemesis, the shoplifter, industry officials say.
   ``Thirty-five percent of store losses happen from Thanksgiving
to Jan. 15,'' said Glenn Ricker, a former Sears, Roebuck and Co.
loss prevention security manager and now a district manager of
investigations for Pinkerton, the nation's oldest private
investigative and security agency.
   Shoplifting is a $40 billion a year scourge for retailers _ and
it is becoming increasingly lucrative for criminals such as
burglars, said Lt. James Hughes, head of the Tucson Police
Department's major offenders unit and burglary task force.
   ``It's newer merchandise, easier than breaking into homes and it
has better resale value when the burglars take it to their fence,''
Hughes said.
   Uniform crime report statistics compiled by the FBI, based on
information from 12,019 law enforcement agencies reflecting a
population of 211.6 million Americans, showed 982,552 shoplifting
offenses in 1988, 3.9 percent more than the 945,671 reported in
1988. The average value of stolen property was $104.
   There was a 35 percent upswing in shoplifting between 1984 and
1988, the FBI said.
   According to Hughes, for every shoplifting incident reported,
another three to four go unreported.
   The National Retail Merchants Association said a study shows
``stock shortages'' _ largely a combination of shoplifting and
employee theft _ account for nearly 2 percent of net retail sales
in department stores.
   The spectrum of shoplifters cuts across age, class and gender
lines, and their methods vary widely, said Ricker.
   ``I've caught 5-year-olds and I've caught 75-year-old ladies,
I've caught guys in wheelchairs,'' he said. ``You don't find too
many 70- or 80-year-olds breaking into houses or cars, but trust
me, you find 70-and 80-year-olds shoplifting.''
   Among shoplifters' schemes:
   _Working in teams, allowing one person to distract a clerk while
the other steals merchandise.
   _Sneaking empty store bags inside the store and filling them
with goods.
   _Detaching electronic alarm tags from merchandise.
   _Loading items into false-bottom bags, coats or loose-fitting
clothing.
   _Razor-cutting the top off a cereal box, emptying the contents
and filling the box with more expensive items, such as cigarettes,
then retaping the top and going through the checkout line.
   An item's size doesn't deter shoplifters. Ricker said he caught
one man who tried to steal a chain-saw.
   Ricker estimated that 75 to 80 percent of all such crime is
drug-related.
   Attempts to combat the problem are almost like ``trying to dam a
river with sand,'' he said.
   Many retailers are turning increasingly to security firms for
help.
   ``We're getting more and more calls from retail sales'' asking
both for uniform security and for undercover investigative
services, said Ronald Janick, Pinkerton senior vice president of
investigations in suburban Philadelphia.
   Said Ricker: ``A lot of corporations now are going to contract
loss prevention agents rather than their own in-house (staff)
because it's a lot more cost-effective.''
   Agencies such as Pinkerton take on responsibility for hiring,
screening and training agents, insurance, turnover and paperwork.
   Pinkerton also supplies undercover operatives who blend in with
regular shoppers and the shoplifters.
   One such is Dianne Ruhl, a private investigator who previously
worked as a security agent in department stores in Tucson.
   Ms. Ruhl said suspicious or unusual behavior is a tipoff to a
trained observer.
   Frequently, those caught shoplifting ask if they can just pay
for the items. But, increasingly, merchants are prosecuting.
   Ms. Ruhl said she recently caught a 25-year-old unemployed man
who had stuffed two packs of Camels between a liner and the outside
part of his coat.
   ``And so he's got a record now for $2.70,'' she said. ``Isn't
that stupid?''

<HEAD>Connecticut: Uncertain Gun Market Makes State Wary of Colt Buyout
Role</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Connecticut officials are reconsidering a
possible investment in the buyout of Colt Industries Inc.'s
firearms division because of uncertainty in the market for guns,
state Treasurer Francisco L. Borges said.
   The state's hesitation is causing concern among the investor
group seeking to buy the firearms division. The group, CF Holdings
Corp., sees Connecticut's investment as the last hurdle before new
owners can take over the troubled gunmaker.
   Borges said state officials have several concerns about joining
the buyout, including a declining world market for handguns and the
possibility of new gun control legislation that could hamper the
new company.
   However, Borges said, ``This does not mean we won't get to a
point where we have something acceptable,'' and he added that talks
were continuing.
   Colt Industries put the Firearms Division on the market last
spring and agreed in late November to sell the division to CF
Holdings in a deal that was to include the state as a shareholder.
   CF Holdings includes Anthony Autorino, former president of
United Technologies' Hamilton Standard division and now president
of Shared Technologies in Wethersfield, Conn.; Richard F. Gamble,
another former Hamilton Standard president; and Ronald F. Stilwell,
Colt Firearm's vice president for military sales.
   The price of the deal was never disclosed but analysts estimated
it could range from $50 million to $200 million. The state has
refused to disclose the size of its possible investment in the
project.
   Autorino said the investor group was becoming anxious about the
state's hesitation.
   ``We have a firm price and an agreement, and time's getting
short,'' he said.
   One obstacle to completing the sale was removed earlier this
week when the United Auto Workers and the investors who would run
the plant agreed to a full settlement of the 3-year-old UAW-Colt
strike and endorsed a contract to return to work.
   ``The union was supposed to be the last hurdle in the deal,''
said Philip Wheeler, chief negotiator fo UAW Local 376. ``That was
the agreement and everybody was happy the union settled. This deal
should be done now.''
   Wheeler would not disclose the details of the strike settlement
and the new union contract Friday ``because financing for the deal
is still pending.''
   ``This is a difficult situation, but as far as we are concerned,
we had an agreement with the state,'' Wheeler said. ``We are still
confident (Borges) will finalize the deal. The deal is still
sound.''

<HEAD>Boeing Computer Services Investigated For $25 Million In Overcharges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co.s' Computer Services division is under
investigation for allegedly overcharging the federal government
about $25 million for research work, a published report said Sunday.
   Boeing confirmed that it was being investigated by the Defense
Criminal Investigative Service and Air Force Office of Special
Investigations, but disputed the results of a Pentagon audit that
said it had exceeded government limits on billable research costs,
the Seattle Times reported.
   An ``investigation is ongoing ...'' said Boeing Chairman Frank
Shrontz in an interview with the Times. ``We don't think there's
been any evidence uncovered to date of any kind of willful fraud or
mischarging.''
   The investigation could result in felony or lesser charges,
administrative action or no action at all.
   There was no answer at the offices of Boeing spokesman when a
reporter called for further comment Sunday.
   The government allows companies to charge some research costs,
within limits, even if the research is used to develop and sell the
companies' own products.
   But auditors from the Pentagon's Defense Contract Audit Agency
said in an April 1988 report that Boeing had exceeded those limits
and improperly charged the expenses to a different account paid by
the government, the Times said.
   About $5.9 million of the $25 million in alleged research
overcharges was publicly revealed in July when Rep. John Conyers
Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Legislation and National Security
subcommittee, released an audit of Boeing Computer Services by the
General Accounting Office, a congressional watchdog agency.
   Parts of the investigation also have been previously revealed,
including a subpeona last summer for documents.
   If Boeing has to repay the costs, it would be a major setback
for the company's money-losing military side. Boeing has faced
numerous allegations of fraud and overcharging related to its
military contracts this year.
   Boeing has agreed to pay $11 million for overstating aluminum
prices in Wichita. It paid more than $5 million in restitution and
fines after pleading guilty to receiving classified Pentagon budget
documents in Virginia.
   Boeing also is facing a critical audit and criminal
investigation of $20 million in charges related to leases with
developer David Sabey in Seattle.
   Shrontz told the Times his company emphasizes ethics, and blamed
Boeing's trouble on ``a significant ... resentment by both the
public and maybe some of the procurement people'' toward the
defense contracting business.
   Boeing was the country's 10th largest defense contractor last
year, with $4.79 billion in government contracts. Military work
accounted for only 25 percent of Boeing's total sales this year.
   The subpoena concerned both Boeing Aerospace and Electronics and
Boeing Computer Services documents, Boeing spokesman Paul Binder
has confirmed.
   Binder told the Times the criminal investigation into billing
practices was not new, but there has been no previous official
acknowledgement of it.
   Maj. Gen. Charles Skipton, commander of the Air Force Contract
Management Division based in New Mexico, wrote in a letter to the
Seattle regional GAO office in September that he had been told
collection of the overcharged amount was being held up for two
reasons, the Times said.
   He wrote that he had been told the investigation was holding
payment up and also that a recent analysis by the Air Force Plant
Representative Office, or on-site contracting officials, did not
totally support the findings of the final GAO report.
   Kent Godfrey, Defense Contract Audit Agency manager in charge of
the Boeing audit work in Seattle, and Phillip Rogers, the agency's
executive officer in Alexandria, Va., declined any comment.
