<HEAD>Former Law Student Called `Viable Suspect' in Green River Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former law student is a ``viable suspect'' in
the Green River slayings, the nation's worst serial murder case,
according to court documents released Thursday.
   The Green River case involves the deaths of 41 women and the
disappearance of at least eight others in Washington state and
Oregon in 1982-85. Most of the victims were young and almost all
were linked to prostitution.
   Former law student William Jay Stevens II, 38, was named in an
affidavit made public Thursday. The affidavit was filed to support a
search warrant for two of Stevens' residences in Spokane, 290 miles
east of Seattle.
   The searches Wednesday yielded a truckload of crime reports,
maps, credit card receipts, 1,800 videotapes, 14 police badges and
two Seattle police uniform shirts, other court documents showed.
   Stevens is serving a one-year term in the King County Jail for
the burglary of a police equipment supply store in Seattle in 1979.
   Police say Stevens walked away from a work-release program in
1981 and was not located until last December, when he was in his
final year at the Gonzaga University law school in Spokane. He was
arrested and returned to jail Jan. 9.
   Stevens has not been charged in the Green River investigation.
   His father, William Stevens Sr., when reached by telephone in
Spokane on Thursday, said, ``I've been advised by my attorney not to
answer any questions.''
   The Green River case takes its name from the river south of
Seattle where the bodies of the first five victims were found. Most
of the bodies were found in the Seattle area. Four were found in
Portland, Ore.
   The tip to Stevens' whereabouts came in a call from Portland,
Ore., after a television program last December about the Green River
killings, police said.
   The search warrant for a house rented by Stevens and for his
parents' house said there was ``probable cause to believe that the
crime of murder has been committed.''
   Green River investigators have long theorized that the victims
might have been lured into the killer's car by someone posing as a
police officer or otherwise in a position of trust.
   ``One of the things that was speculated ... the killer could be a
cop or someone posing as a cop,'' King County Police Capt. Bob
Evans, commander of the multi-agency Green River Task Force, said
Thursday.
   Before Stevens was arrested in January, Spokane police determined
that he owned a former Everett, Wash., police car which had been
equipped and made to appear like a real police car, the affidavit
said.
   The police car had been falsely registered by Stevens, who had
represented himself as the police chief of Spangle, a town 15 miles
south of Spokane.
   Part of the investigation includes a time line which traces his
travels from Seattle to Portland to Vancouver, British Columbia, and
to Spokane.
   The 405 entries on the 1981-88 time-line ``tended to place
Stevens in the area during the time space of a Green River victim's
disappearance,'' the affidavit said.
   ``None of the documented contacts, telephone records or credit
card charges served to eliminate Stevens as a suspect in any of the
Green River cases,'' the affidavit said.
   ``Instead, interviews and records have produced the following
facts that tend to establish that Stevens is a viable suspect in the
Green River homicides,'' the document said.
   Other material taken in the searches included boxes of 1982
newspapers, Portland sex crime reports and Portland police crime
synopses from 1983.
   The affidavit said task force files contained several tips
suggesting Stevens might have been linked to the killings.

   A small plane with a stricken pilot flew hundreds of
miles down the Atlantic Coast on autopilot shadowed by military jets
Thursday, finally running out of gas and spiraling into the ocean.
The pilot then emerged from the wreckage and swam toward his
startled rescuers, authorities said.
   Thomas Root, a 36-year-old lawyer from Alexandria, Va., was
pulled from Bahamian waters by Air Force parachutists four hours
after he had first radioed he was in trouble. He was first taken to
Nassau and a Coast Guard helicopter then flew him to Florida.
   ``For him to survive a crash like that, it just sent us all into
shock,'' said Petty Officer Veronica Cady, a Coast Guard
spokeswoman. ``We didn't expect this story to have a happy ending.''
   Coast Guard Capt. Dr. James Rahman said Root may have passed out
from carbon monoxide poisoning in the cockpit of his single-engine
Cessna and that water splashing in his face apparently roused him.
   Root was taken to Memorial Hospital in Hollywood, where he
underwent three-hours of exploratory surgery for possible internal
injuries.
   After the operation, his condition was upgraded from critical to
stable, said hospital spokeswoman Cynthia Wine. Root's family
requested no information be released on his injuries, she said.
   Root's wife, Kathy, 35, told reporters from the porch of the
family home that her husband had been awake and talking to doctors.
She said she told hospital officials to send her husband the
following message: ``Root, you really did it this time.''
   The drama began about 8:30 a.m. when Root, who had taken off from
Washington National Airport about 6:30 a.m. for Rocky Mount, N.C.,
radioed air traffic controllers in Virginia.
   ``Yessir, we're having a little problem up here,'' Root told
controllers, according to a tape of the conversation played by
Washington television station WRC-TV.
   ``Seem to have a little trouble breathing,'' said Root, who also
reported chest pain. ``How far am I to Rocky Mount now?''
   ``You're about 17 minutes from Rocky Mount,'' replied an
unidentified controller.
   ``Uh,'' said the pilot.
   ``Niner niner one three Yankee, do you hear?'' said the
controller, calling the plane's number.
   There was no further radio contact, and military pilots who
tailed the plane reported he was slumped behind the controls as his
plane flew south off the coast, occasionally getting within 100
miles of the shore.
   Military pilots and rescuers trained to parachute into the ocean
to save ditched pilots could only watch helplessly as their aircraft
tracked the plane until it ran out of gas.
   After more than 3{ hours of radio silence, the plane spiraled
into the water and Root was rescued, 800 miles from his original
destination in North Carolina and 250 miles southeast of Miami.
   ``The words you keep hearing are, `You're kidding,''' said Ms.
Cady.
   The Coast Guard said the plane went down about 15 miles east of
the island of Eleuthera. ``It spiraled into the water, so it didn't
make the best of all possible landings,'' said Chief Petty Officer
Lou Parris.
   Coast Guard Lt. Commander Gary Poll, who was at the scene in a
jet when Root crashed, said the plane was at about 7,000 feet when
it began spiraling in like a corkscrew and spinning down at about
2,000 feet per minute.
   Poll said the nose and left wing hit the water at the same time
and the plane swiveled on its belly on a 360-degree spin. He said it
stayed afloat for several minutes and started to sink.
   Air Force Sgt. Paul Hayden, one of four Air Reserve Technicians
who parachuted into the water, said Root was first spotted swimming
away from the wreckage dressed only in pants and socks.
   Root was pulled onto a raft and given first aid, said Hayden,
based at the 301st Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron in
Homestead, about 20 miles south of Miami.
   ``He told us his abdomen is hurting a lot and we could see he was
bleeding,'' said Hayden. ``It was incredible. He had a sense of
humor about it.''
   Rahman, the doctor who treated Root in Nassau, said Root was
alert and could speak well but seemed to be in shock and had
abdominal injuries and fractured ribs. Rahman said there was no
indication of a heart attack and Root had no history of heart
trouble.
   ``It's definitely a miracle he's alive. He's a little confused by
it all,'' the doctor said.
   After its distress call, the plane was intercepted by two Marine
Corps F-A-18 jet fighters when it entered Norfolk Naval Station
airspace at 8:45 a.m., said Lt. Cmdr. Mike John, a Navy spokesman.
The pilots of the intercepting planes tried unsuccessfully to
contact the pilot by radio, he said.
   The Cessna 210 Centurion can seat four to six people, counting
the pilot, and cruises at about 190 mph. Bill Pierman, shift
supervisor in the air traffic control tower at Washington National,
told Raleigh radio station WPTF that the autopilot was set on a
heading that would have sent the plane toward Bahamas.
   ``Put an airplane on automatic pilot and it's going to continue
just exactly on the course that the automatic pilot is set for,'' he
said.
   At time of crash, Root was followed by a C-130 cargo plane from
Homestead Air Force Base near Miami and an HH3 helicopter from
Patrick Air Force Base, also on Florida's East Coast, said Lt. Col.
Margaret Stanek of Homestead. A flight surgeon was part of the
rescue teams, she said.

<HEAD>Soviets Plan to Launch Ads Into Space, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has hired a British advertising
company to sell broadcast rights and corporate sponsorships for the
first British-Soviet space mission, scheduled for 1991, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
   The New York Times said the Soviets have hired the Saatchi and
Saatchi Company, the world's largest advertising and marketing
conglomerate, to exploit the commercial opportunities of the Juno
mission.
   The mission, which will carry Britain's first astronaut into
orbit from a launching pad in the Soviet Union, will be financed
entirely by the sale of commercial opportunities, the newspaper
said. That includes the sale of space aboard the Soviets' Mir space
station for scientific payloads.
   The Times reported that more than 10,000 men and woman responded
to an advertisement Saatchi placed in several British newspapers in
late June that carried the headline: ``Astronaut wanted. No
experience necessary.''
   If the Soviets are successful in this and other commerical
ventures, a soft drink or cheesburger may be advertised on the side
of a Soviet Soyuz rocket, while commericals to promote a sneaker as
the official athletic footwear of the space product, the newspaper
said.
   The Soviet space agency, Glavkosmos, two weeks ago gave Space
Commerce Corporation in Houston, Texas, the exclusive right to
market its goods and services in the United States.
   Glavkosmos has signed commerical agreements with several Western
companies. In March, a Japanese televison network paid the agency 12
million U.S. dollars for the right to send a correspondent into
space in 1991.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which
administers the U.S. space program, does not accept advertising or
payment from private citizens for flights.
   In the past, U.S. space shuttles have carried some projects for a
fee, but that practice was canceled after the Challenger explosion
in 1986 that killed seven astronauts.

<DATELINE>SALFIT, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For nearly a year, this was a
``liberated'' village. Outlawed PLO flags fluttered from light
poles, activists patrolled the streets, slogans covered the walls,
and popular committees did the work of city hall.
   No longer.
   At dawn on July 5, Israeli soldiers stormed the village of 5,000
people, and reopened army-run government offices, which had been
attacked and burned by rioters in January.
   ``This is a test case. We went in because Salfit had been
portrayed as a main center of the intefadeh,'' or Palestinian
uprising, said Col. Udi Sagey. He referred to Palistinian statements
that the village had been ``liberated'' from Israeli occupation.
   Of the 420 villages in the occupied West Bank, several dozen like
Salfit have declared themselves ``liberated.''
   Sagey, head of the army's Civil Administration unit in the area,
said he planned to reopen its medical center, reconnect the
telephones, restore postal and agricultural extension services, and
resume construction of a new road.
   ``The first goal of the intefadeh leaders has been to cut the
ties between the Israeli authorities and the people,'' he said. ``If
the economic support to these people is greater, maybe they will be
less radical towards Israeli authorities.''
   He said he hoped if normal life was restored in Salfit, it would
have an impact on neighboring villages that depend on Salfit for
services.
   Since the start of the 19-month Palestinian uprising, Salfit was
largely ignored by the army because it is isolated at the end of a
single-lane road. The village is only 18 miles northwest of
Jerusalem, but it is in rocky hills far from main highways and
Jewish settlements.
   In January, Palestinian rioters forced the closure of all
government offices and activists bedecked Salfit with symbols of
independence: red, black, white and green PLO flags and a map of the
would-be Palestinian state on a wall in the town center.
   Popular committees made up of activists aligned with the Fatah
PLO faction and communist groups organized underground schools,
medical services, street cleaning and agriculture.
   In short, Salfit became a microcosm for the independent state
that Palestinians hope they can achieve if Israel's 21-year
occupation is ended.
   ``There is no higher voice than the voice of the intefadeh,''
declared graffiti, freshly painted on a wall where the army had
covered over previous slogans.
   Rafaat, 29, a blacksmith talking with friends at a shop on the
village's main Gamal Abdel Nasser Street, said there has been little
resistance to the army takeover because about 200 activists fled
into the countryside to avoid arrest.
   ``We were liberated for a few months. But now there is more
tension because at any moment a soldier can stop you or arrest
you,'' said Rafaat, who declined to give his full name for fear of
reprisal.
   The streets still bear the evidence of past protests: the remains
of burned tires and scorched stones blocking part of one entrance to
the village.
   Ahmed, a 25-year-old grocer, said soldiers patrol frequently, but
there were some small acts of defiance. He said youths had hung
about 100 flags the previous night.
   This was disputed by a soldier standing guard outside the new
military encampment that sported an Israeli flag. He said there had
been only two flags.
   ``The town is so quiet now that we go on patrol with just our
berets and no helmets,'' he added.
   About a dozen Palestinians gathered at the Civil Administration
offices. One man said he wanted an entry permit to the West Bank for
a relative who lives in Jordan; another said he wanted a travel
document to return to his job in the Arab Gulf.
   Yet another, wearing a bandage to cover a head wound he said was
inflicted by soldiers, had come to get his ID card that had been
taken during a search-and-arrest raid.
   All were kept waiting several hours even though a reporter who
entered the encampment found two army offices sitting alone in their
offices. ``Let them wait for awhile,'' said the guard with a shrug.
   Bassam Abu Maadi, a doctor who lives in a spacious villa on the
edge of town, said Palestinian activists and the army were watching
each other carefully to see what would happen next.
   ``It will not stop in Salfit as long as the intefadeh continues
elsewhere in the West Bank. It will not stop until there is some
hope offered for the future,'' said Abu Maadi, 37.
   During the course of the uprising, he said, three Palestinians
from Salfit had been shot to death and about 50 wounded. About 250
had been detained at one point or another.
   Abu Maadi said arbitrary actions and collective punishments had
left a feeling of resentment toward Israel.
   He said that after a Jewish settler was killed in the West Bank
in June, soldiers came to his house, broke the porch lights and
smashed a front window.
   ``I came downstairs and opened the door. An officer hit me in the
face without warning or comment. He then ordered me to go to the
school where everyone was being rounded up,'' Abu Maadi said.
   ``If I do something wrong, I will accept punishment. But this is
punishing everyone.''

   Norwegian defense officials have added
turbans to the military dress code after a year-long battle by a
Sikh immigrant who demanded the right to keep his traditional dress
during military service.
   Harvinder Singh, 25, became the first Norwegian soldier ever
allowed to wear a turban on duty, the newspaper Verdens Gang
reported Wednesday.
   Singh, who came from India in 1978, was called up in July for a
year of compulsory military training. He wanted to serve but refused
to remove his turban, the newspaper said.
   Singh was sent home while military officials mulled over the
problem.
   The supreme command decided that Norway must adapt to recruits
from various cultures and ordered that standard issue turbans be
prepared to fit the military dress code, defense spokesman Erik
Sinstad told the newspaper.

<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABOARD THE SOVIET CRUISER TALLINN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet navy sought a
high seas show of glasnost, but dense fog obscured much of the
Pacific Fleet's two-day maneuvers and hampered its planned display
of firepower.
   It invited reporters from the United States, Japan, Britain and
Australia, who went aboard the anti-submarine vessel Tallinn to
watch the exercises in the Sea of Japan. Also on board were
officials from India, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia.
   The United States rejected an invitation but dispatched the
frigate USS Holt and at least one helicopter to keep an eye on the
maneuvers, Soviet officials said.
   The fog, which rolled in Monday evening and remained for the next
two days, made much of the observation of the ships, planes and
helicopters impossible. The navy was forced to alter its plans for
mock battles and conduct a short-range demonstration of anti-ship
missiles, depth charges, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-launched
torpedos.
   The Soviets also arranged a tour of a destroyer at fleet
headquarters in Vladivostok and a launch ride to view the task force
at anchor. They allowed reporters to wander about the ships to which
they were assigned.
   Inquiries about specific weapons and plans were ignored, however,
and a request to visit the Tallinn's Combat Information Center, the
nerve center of a modern naval vessel, was politely rejected with
the explanation that the captain was too busy.
   Observers did see two ships ready for inspection. Gray paint,
some of it fresh, covered most surfaces on the Tallinn and the
destroyer Stoiki. Brass name plates were polished. The portraits of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin
were in place along the gangways.
   In the sailors' quarters, personal belongings were put away and
all bunks were made. No space was wasted. Each ordinary sailor,
practically all of whom are drafted, gets one-third of the space
beneath the bottom bunk for uniforms, a cubbyhole for toiletries,
and a cabinet large enough to hold about three books for personal
belongings.
   Asked how he liked maritime life, a 17-year-old sailor standing
watch for the visitors replied with a shrug. ``Service is service,''
he said.
   One officer said only 10 percent of the conscripts re-enlist
after their three-year stint.
   The exercises were designed to demonstrate the Soviet navy's
defensive posture and its ability to protect a convoy from attack,
but the traditionally secretive navy also tried to score some
political points.
   The fleet commander, Adm. Gennady A. Khvatov, called the tour an
example of the ``new political thinking'' supported by Gorbachev.
Others emphasized the ethnic diversity of the sailors from a country
with searing ethnic disputes.
   Capt. Viktor V. Obraztsov, head of the Communist Party's
political department for the task force, said members from 29 of the
Soviet Union's more than 100 nationalities make up the Tallinn's
321-man crew.
   Western naval specialists say most Soviet officers come from the
Slavic republics of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and the Russian
federation.
   The United States refused to send observers to watch the
exercises partly in solidarity with Japan, which considered them a
provocation because they were held near islands that the Soviets
seized in the closing days of World War II.
   The Soviet Union and Japan have never signed a peace treaty
ending the war, largely because of the dispute over possession of
the Kuril islands, known as the Northern Territories in Japan.
   Western naval experts, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the United States encouraged its Pacific allies to stay away because
it does not want to feel obligated to invite Soviet officers aboard
ship during annual exercises by the U.S. 3rd Fleet.

   The Beijing zoo has become the world's first to
artificially breed a crested ibis, a long-billed wading bird that is
near extinction, the China Daily said today.
   The 2-ounce bird was born Monday, ending a three-year effort by
the zoo to find a way to artificially propagate the species, the
official daily said.
   It said the 4-year-old mother delivered two eggs in mid-June, but
pecked one of the babies to death. The other was removed to a
breeding box for special care.
   The crested ibis was once found in the Soviet Union, the Korean
peninsula, Japan and Taiwan as well as China, but its population has
declined dramatically because of destruction to its environment, the
daily said.
   It said only about 48 of the species survive, two in Japan and
the rest in Yangxian County of central China's Shaanxi province.

   A horse that knows when it's safe to cross
intersections allows a blind former cowboy to keep his independence,
but the city says the man must clean up after the animal or lose the
privilege.
   George Bradford, 69, who retains about 1 percent of his sight in
one eye, has a year to persuade the City Council to let him keep two
horses, Blue Rocky and Buck, in his back yard.
   When Bradford rides Blue Rocky through town, the horse stops at
intersections and doesn't move until traffic is flowing in the
direction the horse is supposed to go.
   In 1981, the City Council granted Bradford a lifetime zoning
variance allowing him to keep the horses in town.
   But inspectors reported in 1987 that Bradford wasn't cleaning up
after the horses and was bothering neighbors with the smell. The
variance was revoked and a judge fined Bradford $100. The fine was
thrown out on appeal.
   Last month, a judge gave Bradford a year to change the council's
mind or move the horses.
   ``Now, hopefully, what we're doing is right,'' said Mayor Ernest
Thompson. ``As far as being unfair, he's the one who's being unfair
to his neighbors.''
   Bradford said the neighbor behind the complaints is Eddie
Wallace, who wanted to sell his house next door but was afraid
Bradford's horses would lower property values.
   Wallace is not on speaking terms with Bradford nor with reporters.
   ``I don't want to say nothing about that crap. No, bye,'' he
said, hanging up.
   Bradford, who likes to smoke hand-rolled cigarettes and reminisce
about the days when he worked as a cowboy in Texas and New Mexico,
had to stop working in 1964 because of retinitis pigmentosa, a
hereditary degenerative eye disease.
   But Bradford likes to ride Blue Rocky the two miles to downtown
Artesia, across six intersections with stoplights.
   He could see better about 10 years ago, when he got Blue Rocky
and started leading the horse on his walks into town. When Bradford
heard traffic going in the direction he was walking, that meant the
light had turned green and he would cross the intersection.
   Now the horse decides when it's time to cross.
   ``He automatically stops anyhow at any intersection,'' Bradford
said. ``I guarantee you he won't go unless the traffic is going my
way. Whether he can read the light is the $64 question.''
   Other times, Bradford rides his horse into the hills west of his
house.
   ``You know, I can get kind of down and out because I can't work,
and get on that old horse and ride five or six miles and, hey, I got
a different outlook on life all of a sudden,'' Bradford said. ``I'm
completely independent.''
   He shudders at the thought of losing his horses.
   ``Oh, I suppose somebody could take me places, but you have to go
back when they want to go back _ you know, you're not independent.''

<HEAD>Olivier's Death: The End of An Era?</HEAD>

   Laurence Olivier is gone. Will the theater world
ever see his like again?
   Said critic Bernard Levin, who wrote in The Times after Olivier
died Tuesday: ``No one will replace the splendor that he gave his
native land with his genius.''
   Other critics say that while another Olivier may be in the wings,
they feel today's entertainment industry makes it doubtful.
   Primarily a man of the stage, Olivier became a superstar in all
media. The sheer quantity of his work is among the most noteworthy
aspects of a career that ended with his death at age 82, at his
country home south of London.
   But Olivier was also the consummate actor-manager _ a passionate
theater advocate as important behind the scenes as a director and
organizer as he was on stage as a performer.
   Few theater observers would dispute that first-rate British
actors continue to abound. Derek Jacobi, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony
Hopkins, Glenda Jackson, Alan Bates, Maggie Smith and Ian McKellen
are just some of the generation after Olivier who have been widely
and often acclaimed.
   Then there's a still younger generation less known abroad but
already staring greatness in the eye: Kenneth Branagh, Antony Sher,
Juliet Stevenson, Fiona Shaw.
   And although Olivier's death is being called the end of an era,
he is survived by such stalwart knights and dames of stage as John
Gielgud, John Mills, Rex Harrison, Alec Guinness, Wendy Hiller and
Peggy Ashcroft.
   But it's Olivier's level of commitment to the art form he
cherished that may be in shorter supply.
   ``Will anyone ever again go on for so long, play so many great
parts, run so many companies?'' asked Michael Coveney in The
Financial Times. ``Will they want to enough? We must doubt it until
they do.''
   Milton Shulman in The Evening Standard also feared such
dedication was dying. ``The likes of Olivier, nurtured on
greasepaint, the footlights, and the effrontery of daring an
audience to like you, are fast becoming an endangered species.''
   The stage instead, he wrote, is ``fast becoming the casting
kindergarten for film and TV.''
   The trend is increasing in Britain as talented young theater
actors opt for the greater financial rewards of film and TV.
   Natasha Richardson, Hugh Grant, James Wilby, and Amanda Donohoe
are just some of the classically schooled young English talents who
work mostly on screen.
   Among the older generation, none has matched the initiative of
Olivier, who in 1963 realized an old dream of establishing a
National Theater of Great Britain.
   ``The quality of work we do here is mostly due to him,'' veteran
actor Michael Bryant told Tuesday night's audience at the National's
production of ``The Voysey Inheritance.''
   Some feel Olivier's death ends a kind of theatrical majesty that
transcends issues of talent.
   In an editorial entitled ``Stage Colossus,'' The Daily Telegraph
wrote: ``He was the undisputed leader of his profession, its
spokesman, and the brightest jewel in its crown. We shall not look
upon his like again.''
   Levin wrote: ``What we have lost with Laurence Olivier is glory.
... You could practically see it growing around him like a nimbus.''
   Denis Quilley, Olivier's co-star in a celebrated London
production of Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,''
said in an interview, ``There are people today (like Olivier) but
not on the same scale.''
   Would-be inheritors most frequently mentioned are men like
Michael Pennington and the protean Branagh, Guy Pringle in the TV
series ``Fortunes of War,'' who combine thespian dynamism with a
team spirit.
   Both have started theater companies _ Pennington, the English
Shakespeare Company, which finished a world tour in Britain this
spring, and Branagh, the Renaissance Theater Company, which had a
sell-out Shakespeare season on the West End last fall.
   Branagh, 28, tempted further comparisons to Olivier by starring
on stage and screen as Shakespeare's Henry V, one of Olivier's most
celebrated achievements. Branagh's film is due out in the fall.
   Antony Sher's 1984 Richard III also was likened to Olivier's. But
South African-born Sher, 40, has forsaken the spotlight to focus on
writing.
   Diana Rigg, who appeared with Olivier at Stratford-upon-Avon and
in his 1983 TV ``King Lear,'' says the case isn't closed on
greatness.
   ``It's impossible to say you'll never see the likes of him
again,'' she said in an interview. ``The profession is full of
incredibly talented people, some in the cradle.''

<UNK>Briton Claims Record As First Woman To Cross English Channel By Hang
Glider</UNK>
<DATELINE>DOVER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Briton has claimed a place in the record
books as the first woman to cross the English Channel by hang
glider, making the 21-mile trip to France in 22 minutes.
   Strapped into her frail craft, 29-year-old Judy Leden was first
lifted to 13,500 feet over Dover by a hot air balloon Wednesday
morning.
   The balloon's pilot, Ron Griffin, then cut the rope on which the
hang glider was suspended 30 feet below his craft, sending the
glider into a spinning 200-foot nose dive before it leveled out and
began its downward glide.
   Miss Leden came down on a beach at Le Chatelet midway between the
French north coast ports of Calais and Boulogne.
   After landing, she admitted to being scared at the start of the
flight: ``It was the highest I had ever been with a hang glider so I
was going into the unknown.
   ``I am not frightened very easily but I was terrified for a short
time. Because of the thinness of the air at 13,000 feet I went to at
least 110 degrees and was rotating very fast, which is the way the
hang glider recovers and begins to fly.
   ``I kept my nerve ... but once that horrible moment was over I
had a lovely smooth glide over to France.''
   Preparations for the flight, which was sponsored by an auto
company, were dogged by technical problems for a year. But Miss
Leden said Wednesday's crossing was ``incredibly smooth, without any
serious complications.''
   Miss Leden, from Derbyshire in northern England, holds the
women's world open distance hang gliding record of 145.34 miles.
   That flight, listed in the Guinness Book of Records, was between
Nevada and California over Owens Valley on July 13, 1983.
   She was honored by Queen Elizabeth II this year by being made a
Member of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of her
services to the sport.
   British news reports said the only other hang glider pilot to fly
across the English Channel was Briton Ken Messenger in 1977. He
suffered frostbite because of cold at the high altitude from which
he started.
   Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement after Miss
Leden's crossing Wednesday that for safety reasons it will not allow
any further hang gliding attempts across the English Channel.
   The skies above the Channel are a major commercial air route.

   Britons are witnessing something that has become
unusual in the past decade of union-curbing Thatcherism: a striking
blue-collar union is enjoying a measure of public sympathy.
   Wednesday saw the fourth one-day strike in a month of the
national rail network and London subways. Yet the union leaders,
while hardly popular national figures, appear as people with a real
grievance.
   ``They're enjoying a remarkable amount of public support
considering how hard the public is hit directly,'' said Richard
Hope, editor of the Railway Gazette, a independent monthly.
   He attributes this to a general sense that British Rail is
underpaying its staff as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher cuts the
state-owned company's subsidies to the lowest in Europe.
   The goal, in line with the free-market philosophy of Mrs.
Thatcher's Conservative Party, is to make British Rail
self-financing. But what the public mostly sees is higher fares,
demoralized staff and falling service standards.
   A Gallup poll shows 69 percent of Britons favor more subsidies,
not less.
   With unfortunate timing, British Rail announced in the middle of
the pay dispute that its profits were a record $492 million last
year, largely from real estate sales.
   Meanwhile, the media are focusing on recent hefty pay increases
for top executives, such as the 86.5 percent raise for Lord Sharp,
chairman of Cable and Wireless, who now earns $630,780 a year.
   With overtime, train drivers average $24,840 a year and they want
a 10 percent raise to beat the 8.3 percent inflation rate.
   A poll Wednesday in the usually pro-Thatcher Daily Mail showed
that of 2,770 rail passengers questioned, only 23 percent placed
sole blame on the unions. It said 33 percent blamed management, 20
percent blamed the government, and 14 percent thought all sides were
guilty. Ten percent had no opinion.
   Mrs. Thatcher's last big battle against organized labor ended
with a crushing defeat for the coal miners in 1985, and widespread
applause for the prime minister's tough stand.
   But Jimmy Knapp, head of the 75,000 member National Union of
Railwaymen, is a benign figure, when compared to Arthur Scargill,
the Marxist miners' leader who led surging crowds of pickets in
pitched battles with police.
   A gruff man with tufts of snow-white hair, Knapp sticks to a
simple unpolitical message: that British Rail's 7 percent pay raise
offer is below inflation, and that it wants to break up the union
and weaken its collective bargaining power.
   Mrs. Thatcher says the strikers are selfish and dominated by
left-wing extremists, but in the image war, Knapp puts up a credible
challenge. It has been some time since a British union boss was
described in print as ``cuddly.''
   Transport Minister Paul Channon's well-publicized walks to work
on strike days were dismissed by the conservative Sunday Telegraph
as ``embarrassingly unconvincing.''
   And British Rail apparently miscalculated when, instead of
waiting for the result of an arbitration effort, it asked the courts
to ban the strike.
   The courts refused, and the public's sense of fair play was
offended because the union had scrupulously obeyed Mrs. Thatcher's
union-curbing laws by balloting its members and obtaining the
necessary 55 percent majority for a strike.
   There are no mass pickets at train stations, just silence.
Columnist Alan Watkins, in the liberal Observer newspaper, wonders
what ``has happened to all those gentlemen, usually wearing bowler
hats, who would enliven any railway dispute by assaulting station
staff with their umbrellas?''
   The transport strikes are part of a wave of industrial unrest
also hitting the docks, the BBC and local government services.
Coupled with resurgent inflation and rising interest rates, they
have pushed Mrs. Thatcher to 10 points behind the socialist Labor
Party in opinion polls.
   Ironically, Mrs. Thatcher's own success in taming organized labor
may now be working against her. Britons elected her in 1979 because
they wanted a tough response to unions that were perceived as too
left-wing and powerful. That perception has since waned.
   ``A decade ago, 80 percent of people thought the trade unions
were too powerful. Now it's down to three in 10,'' says Bob
Worcester, head of Market and Opinion Research International.
   ``A decade ago, 53 percent said most trade unions were controlled
by extremists and militants, now it's only 20 percent.''
   ``In a sense, the ballot has given strikes a spurious sense of
legitimacy,'' said Graham Mather of the right-wing Institute of
Economic Affairs. He wants the government to implement its threat to
ban strikes in essential services.

   A newlywed couple looking through the ashes
of what had been their home found most of their belongings destroyed
by a wildfire. Their dog found a stray cat _ singed but alive _
inside the refrigerator.
   ``We lost everything. I don't even have proof of who I am,'' said
Laurie Voit-Perry.
   Voit-Perry said she and her husband, Pete, a former University of
Colorado football player, were married June 24 and were on a
honeymoon until July 5, four days before the fire broke out.
   The blaze, which started Sunday, burned 2,000 acres in the
Boulder Canyon, and destroyed 37 homes and numerous other
structures. Officials expected to bring it under control today.
   The couple fled as fire engulfed the ridgetop house where they
had planned to begin married life.
   Voit-Perry, 29, said among the items lost in the blaze were
wedding gifts, including cash, a gas barbecue and handmade quilts
from friends.
   ``I would say, `I'm going to take a picture of the property,'''
Voit-Perry said after looking over the damage Tuesday. ``Pete would
say, `We don't have a camera any more' ... the realization is
setting in.''
   But her dog, Zack, sniffed at the refrigerator, which the cat
somehow managed to use as a shelter.
   The 3-year-old, 9{-pound female cat was taken to the All Pets
Clinic in Boulder where it was treated for injuries to its paws and
a high fever.
   Dr. Brenda Gurule said it should survive.

   Upsetting a time-honored tradition of the House of
Commons, Deputy Speaker Betty Boothroyd told a legislator to stop
calling her Mr. and start calling her Madam.
   In accordance with usual practice, legislator Ann Winterton of
the governing Conservative Party on Wednesday referred to Miss
Boothroyd as ``Mr. Deputy Speaker'' during a late-night debate in
the absence of Speaker Bernard Weatherill.
   But Miss Boothroyd told her: ``I long to be a female. Vive la
difference. I am Madam Deputy Speaker.''
   Mrs. Winterton replied: ``I am a traditionalist and I hope you
will not mind, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if I refer to you as Mr.''
   But Miss Boothroyd did. ``While I am in the chair, I am to be
addressed as Madam Deputy Speaker,'' she ruled.
   The Commons clings to a variety of strange customs and rituals
inherited from the past. The ``Mr. Deputy Speaker'' tag dates back
to the all-male days before 1919, when Lady Astor became the first
woman legislator.

   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, accompanied by an
entourage of up to 200, including his wives, plans to enter the
Cleveland Clinic for a physical examination and possible knee
surgery, a hospital spokesman said.
   Twenty rooms are being refurbished for security reasons and to
suit the 67-year-old monarch's tastes, said Gary Weiland, a clinic
spokesman.
   The exam will coincide with Fahd's official state visit to the
United States, Weiland said Wednesday night.
   Fahd is to meet with President Bush on July 27.
   A spokesman at the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Washington would
neither confirm nor deny Fahd's visit to Cleveland. Such a trip
would be announced once he arrived in the United States, the
spokesman said.
   Weiland said he did not know when the king would arrive.
   An advance team scouted hospitals in four U.S. cities and chose
the clinic because of its expertise in orthopedic surgery, and
because the king's half-brother, Khaled, had heart surgery there
twice, Weiland said. Khaled, who preceded Fahd as Saudi Arabia's
king, died in 1982.
   Extensive remodeling of the Clinic Center Hotel, which had been
scheduled this year, has been speeded up in preparation for the
visit, Weiland said. Some of the entourage will stay at other hotels.

   Jose Canseco, the Oakland Athletics
slugger who has more speeding citations than major league hits this
season, had another brush with the law.
   Canseco got his latest ticket Tuesday while driving his new white
Porsche home to watch the All-Star game. He was ticketed for driving
51 mph in a 35 mph zone, said California Highway Patrol spokesman
Nick Verhoek.
   The officer who stopped him believed he was going over 65 mph on
winding Crow Canyon Road but couldn't get a radar reading, Verhoek
said. Canseco was ticketed on the same road a few months ago.
   ``I got stopped for going 13 miles over the speed limit. Can you
believe that?'' Canseco asked at a workout Wednesday at the Oakland
Coliseum.
   When asked if he got a ticket, Canseco said, ``Me? Not get a
ticket?''
   Canseco was voted the American League's Most Valuable Player last
year, but he hasn't played in major league games this year because
of a wrist injury.
   In February, Canseco was ticketed in Florida for driving 125 mph
in his $75,000 red Jaguar. Canseco said later he was doing only 120
mph. In March, he was ticketed again in Arizona.

   A libel suit against pop rocker Daryl Hall has been
dismissed by a judge who ruled the plaintiff was ``forum shopping''
when he filed the lawsuit in Florida.
   U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King noted neither Hall nor
the plaintiff, fellow entertainment figure John Madera, had any
Florida connections.
   Madera claimed he was libeled in an interview given by Hall to
Music Connection magazine for its November-December 1986 issue.
   Hall described the deterioration of his relationship with Madera
in the interview. He was quoted as saying, ``He had his day in the
sun. But he was pretty much a small-time kind of guy.''
   Madera said Hall's statements damaged his reputation in the
entertainment industry.
   The judge noted that Hall, whose hits include ``Private Eyes''
and ``Rich Girl,'' lives in New York and the magazine was based in
California.
   Madera tried to sue before in New York and California, but the
cases exceeded the statute of limitations in those states, King said.
   He sued in Miami in May 1988, about 18 months after the alleged
offense. Florida has a two-year statute of limitations.

   When arriving for Wednesday's arraignment, she was met at the
courthouse by a crowd of reporters and several relatives, who held
signs that said ``Free Zsa Zsa.''
   Miss Gabor was arrested June 14 after Kramer pulled over her
Rolls-Royce for an expired registration. She drove off as Kramer was
checking for other infractions, then slapped him when he got her to
stop two blocks later.

   Thousands of country music fans will head
for the hills this weekend to see Kathy Mattea, Willie Nelson, The
Charlie Daniels Band and other stars at one of the nation's largest
outdoor country concerts.
   At least 60,000 people are expected at the 13th Annual Jamboree
in the Hills, said concert spokeswoman Kathy Oliver.
   More than 20 recording artists and bands will perform during the
19-hour festival, scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. Saturday with an
appearance by Louise Mandrell.
   One of the regular performers is Tom T. Hall, who has missed only
one of the outdoor jamborees.
   ``It's kind of like a homecoming for me,'' Hall said.
   Other stars scheduled are The Bellamy Brothers, Patty Loveless,
Mel McDaniel, Highway 101, Restless Heart, K.D. Lang, Michael Martin
Murphey, Mel Tillis and George Jones.

   The Marines were battling for every
inch of beachhead and met no resistance from about 2,000 spectators.
   Four amphibious landing craft from the USS Boulder bounded ashore
Wednesday and disgorged 90 Marines in full battle gear.
   Instead of charging deadly pillboxes and lethal snipers, the
leathernecks directed blank fire toward toward a pop stand, three
port-a-johns and a festively colored tent where a six-piece Navy
band had been playing.
   With bases concentrated on ocean coasts, the Navy and Marines
rarely get to show their stuff to Midwesterners, said Navy Lt. David
Knox.
   Spectators on the Lake Michigan beach broke into applause as the
blank automatic weapons fire finally ceased.
   ``It was really cool,'' said 13-year-old Ryan Huff.
   Mayor Robert Behler, an ex-Marine, rode in the assault wave
carrying a fantasy instead of a rifle.
   ``I wanted to dress like (Gen. Douglas) MacArthur and just stand
on the beach with my corncob pipe and glasses,'' he said.

   A man climbed into a hot tub with a joke
and planned to keep up the routine for three days to set a new mark
for hot tub humor.
   ``It's great. Surf's up,'' John Parker said about a half-hour
into his marathon Wednesday. He plans to stay there for at least 73
hours, until Saturday morning.
   He started out with some elephant jokes.
   ``Why do elephants have flat feet?'' he asked. ``It's obviously
because they jump out of trees.''
   ``Most of the jokes are off the top of my head and are jokes I've
collected from 19 years in the radio business,'' said Parker, 36.
``Of course, after 27 hours or so you begin to hallucinate, so
fortunately the Guinness people allow me to use cue cards.''
   The 1989 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records lists him
as the record-holder for time spent telling jokes in a hot tub with
a 52-hour effort, but someone in Portugal has topped that mark.
   The effort to regain the title has its risks.
   ``I've got to keep the temperature of the water between 85 and 90
degrees,'' Parker said. ``Any lower than 85 and hypothermia sets in
without me knowing it. I can go numb, nod off. Any higher than 90,
and I can boil myself without knowing it.''
   Wrinkled feet are another hazard, said Parker, who has survived
four tub-joking marathons. He plans to solve the problem by keeping
his feet out of the water much of the time.
   Parker has a penchant for spending long periods in odd places.
``I once sat in spaghetti for three days,'' he said.
   Unfortunately, Guinness lists no record for spaghetti-sitting.

   House Republicans and Democrats are forecasting
a rocky congressional ride for the stealth bomber despite the Air
Force assessment that the half-billion-dollar aircraft is key to
U.S. strategic forces.
   ``The B-2 program is in a lot of trouble,'' Rep. William
Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the House Armed Services
Committee, told Air Force officials who pleaded their case Wednesday.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was to present his argument for the
bomber today before the House panel.
   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice and Chief of Staff Larry Welch
met with stiff resistance from lawmakers Wednesday as they urged
members at House and Senate sessions to continue spending for the
$70 billion program.
   Rice and Welch told the committee that stretching out the B-2
program would increase the cost significantly. Current estimates put
the pricetag of a single bomber between $500 million and $750
million, making it the most expensive plane in history.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said extending the program could raise the price of a
single bomber to $1 billion.
   ``If you make the annual cost acceptable, the sticker price
becomes unacceptable,'' Aspin said. ``If you make the sticker price
acceptable, the annual cost becomes unacceptable. I don't know how
to fix it.''
   Moments after Aspin's comments, Dickinson put it more bluntly to
the Air Force officials.
   ``When the chairman tells you you're not going to get it
politically, you can put it in your pocket and take it to the
bank,'' Dickinson said.
   Rep. Herbert H. Bateman, R-Va., added: ``I want to put my head
down and cry. You made a compelling case but I don't know where to
get the money to pay for it.''
   Two committee Republicans _ Reps. John Rowland of Connecticut and
John Kasich of Ohio _ have joined forces with liberal Democrat
Ronald Dellums of California on an amendment to shut down production
of the B-2 after the manufacturer, Northrop Corp., produced 13
planes.
   The amendment, which the lawmakers said they will introduce on
the House floor, would allow the 13 planes to be developed and
tested and then a decision would be made on whether to continue the
program.
   ``It's a reasonable, moderate position,'' said Rowland, who
believes the coalition can win support from members stunned by the
cost of the radar-evading aircraft.
   But the Air Force argues the B-2 outpaces improvements in Soviet
air defenses, is important to nuclear deterrence and can be used in
a conventional role.
   Despite the sticker shock, the B-2 ``comes down as the only
candidate for some categories of things we want to do,'' Rice said.

   Parisians here see oil derricks instead of
the Eiffel Tower and favor crape myrtles over crepes, but don't
expect them to call July 14 anything other than Bastille Day.
   When Parisians in France toast the 200th anniversary of their
revolution on Friday, their namesakes here will, too _ Texas-style.
   The fete will include a barbecue, quilting contests, music, plays
and ``Tour de Paris'' bike races expected to draw up to 1,500
entrants to this town of 27,000 people 200 miles northeast of Dallas.
   City leaders and businesses started the Bastille Day celebrations
10 years ago thinking, ``Why not?'' said Linda Suarez, program
coordinator of the Paris Chamber of Commerce.
   ``It started out as a downtown merchants' promotion, a sidewalk
sale, real small and kind of quaint,'' she said. But as word of the
festival grew, ``We just thought we'd take advantage of it.''
   France and Texas have fraternal ties, she said. ``France was one
of the first to recognize Texas as an independent (republic) ... and
the French flag was one of the six that flew over Texas,'' Ms.
Suarez said.
   As part of the celebration, about 20 high school girls will
compete for the title of Crape Myrtle Queen, with the winner
receiving a bouquet from the flowering trees.
   Hungry revelers can feast on pastries from ``Marie A.'s Cake
Company,'' named for Marie Antoinette, the haughty monarch known for
saying ``Let them eat cake.''
   The U.S. Postal Service even has a commemorative cancellation
mark for July 14 letters.
   ``It's got a little Eiffel Tower on one side and an oil derrick
on the other,'' Ms. Suarez said. ``Our logo, on little pins, is a
little Eiffel Tower with a cowboy hat on top. ... They're a real big
hit.''
   The only thing missing will be a French dignitary, she said.
``But, they've got their own birthday party.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1989 wheat crop is turning out better than
many believe possible a few months ago, but it still is far short in
many areas where last year's drought lingered on.
   New Agriculture Department estimates put the harvest at 2.12
billion bushels, a 17 percent increase from last year's 1.81 billion
bushels and the most since 1985 when farmers produced 2.43 billion
bushels.
   For the first time this season, the USDA estimates issued
Wednesday included durum and ``other'' spring-planted wheat, in
addition to winter wheat planted last fall.
   Reggie Wyckoff, president of the National Association of Wheat
Growers, said the USDA estimate was ``a little higher'' than he had
expected and that there will be adequate supplies through the
1989-90 marketing year if the current projections are correct.
   ``But it also shows evidence that there is disaster in many
areas'' where wheat yields have tumbled, Wyckoff said in a telephone
interview. ``It's pretty rough in hard, red winter wheat areas.''
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said the average
yield, based on indications as of July 1, was estimated at 33.4
bushels per acre, down from 34.1 bushels last year.
   But farmers are expected to have about 63.5 million acres of
wheat for harvest this year, up from 53.2 million in 1988, the board
said in its report.
   The USDA's first official estimate of 1989 production of corn,
soybeans and some other major spring-planted crops will be issued on
Aug. 10, along with revised figures for wheat.
   However, the July report did show new figures for 1989 plantings
of major crops. Corn plantings were estimated at 65.8 million acres
for harvest, up from 58.2 million acres in 1988, and soybeans, 60.2
million acres, up from 57.4 million.
   Cotton plantings were estimated at 10.5 million acres, down 16
percent from 1988. That was also 5 percent below a preliminary
forecast in March.
   Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.46 billion bushels,
down 6 percent from 1988, reduced sharply in Kansas and some other
parts of the Great Plains by lingering effects of last year's
drought. It makes up about three-fourths of total U.S. wheat
production.
   The Kansas wheat crop estimate, however, was boosted slightly to
211.2 million bushels from the June forecast of 202.4 million. Even
so, it was down by more than a third from last year.
   Winter wheat fared better in 1988 because most was harvested or
had matured before the full impact of heat and drought was felt.
   Durum wheat production was estimated at 111.3 million bushels, up
from 44.8 million in 1988, and ``other'' spring wheat was indicated
at 544.1 million bushels, compared with 205.5 million last year.
   Department economists say the decline in wheat supplies since
last year's reduced harvest is having only slight effect on consumer
food prices, which are expected to rise an average of 4 percent to 7
percent, compared with a 4.1 percent gain in 1988.
   A related supply-and-demand report showed that U.S. wheat
inventories may total 592 million bushels by the end of the current
marketing year next May 31, down from 694 million bushels this June
1.
   Last month, when the crop was thought to be smaller, analysts
projected inventories could decline to 500 million bushels next
spring.
   The report showed wheat prices could average $3.75 to $4.10 per
bushel in 1989-90, down from the range of $3.80 to $4.20 projected
in June but still above the $3.72 average for last season.
   Wheat exports were projected at around 1.23 billion bushels, down
from 1.44 billion bushels in 1988-89.
   Corn production, based on past trends and the current outlook,
was projected at 7.45 billion bushels, up from last year's
drought-shriveled 4.92 billion bushels.
   But the July corn outlook was down from June's projection of 7.85
billion bushels, due partly to late plantings in the eastern Corn
Belt and ``continued limited moisture'' conditions in the west.
   The soybean crop was projected at 1.95 billion bushels, unchanged
from the June forecast and up sharply from 1988 output of 1.54
billion bushels. The price outlook also was unchanged at $4.75 to
$6.25 per bushel, compared with an average of $7.35 in 1988-89.

   The United States has proposed a technical
measure designed to speed the reduction of barriers to trade in farm
products.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills says the Bush
administration wants other nations to convert non-tariff import
barriers, such as quotas and restrictive licenses, to tariffs.
   ``By converting to tariffs, barriers would be more transparent
and uniform, making it easier to negotiate worldwide reductions in
agriculture support and protection,'' she said Wednesday in a
statement.
   The proposal was made in Geneva in trade negotiations with 100
other nations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT), which regulates world trade treaties and settles
commerce disputes. The current series of talks, known as the Uruguay
Round, began in 1986 and are scheduled to run through next year.
   In April, GATT negotiators achieved a breakthrough in the talks,
which had been deadlocked since December, reaching broad agreement
in four key areas, including a compromise on a U.S. demand to do
away with all trade-distorting agricultural subsidies. The talks
since then have been aimed at nailing down specifics of how to
achieve the goals of the larger compromise.
   Hills said the U.S. ``tariffication'' proposal must be part of a
more comprehensive package including fundamental reforms in domestic
farm subsidies, export subsidies and sanitary rules.

   The Pentagon disagrees with American scientists
who say their visit to a long-secret Soviet laser research center
convinces them the facility is not a threat to U.S. satellites.
   A Defense Department official said Wednesday that videotape taken
by the scientists of the Sary-Shagan laser facility in Soviet
Central Asia ``only firms up'' the department's view that the laser
facility is capable of incapacitating U.S. satellites.
   The scientists, however, said Wednesday their inspection of the
facility last week convinced them it poses no military threat. They
said the Pentagon had greatly exaggerated the facility's importance.
   ``This facility really hasn't had large resources devoted to it
since the 1970s,'' said Frank von Hippel of Princeton University,
one of the scientists who visited the site as part of a broader
inspection program sanctioned by the Soviet government.
   The scientists showed the videotapes at a news conference
Wednesday.
   No U.S. government officials were included in the visit.
   The Pentagon official, who asked that he not be identified, said
the Pentagon still believes that while the Sary-Shagan laser center
may be unable to knock a satellite out of space, it can do enough
damage to ``negate our satellite capabilities.''
   John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists told reporters
the Sary-Shagan laser is not powerful enough to shoot down
satellites or ballistic missiles.
   He said it was 100 to 1,000 times less powerful than an American
power laser at White Sands, N.M., that he called only marginally
capable of shooting down satellites.
   Pike was not on the tour but described for reporters his analysis
of the photographic and other evidence gathered by the tour group,
which also visited a Soviet nuclear weapons production center and
conducted radiation experiments on a nuclear-armed Soviet Navy
cruiser in the Black Sea.
   He noted the Pentagon, beginning in 1984, had described the laser
center as the heart of an ominous Soviet anti-satellite program with
ground-based lasers that could shoot down satellites and in the
future might be able to destroy ballistic missiles.
   ``It is clear that the threat posed by this facility has been
wildly exaggerated over the last several years,'' Pike said, adding
the U.S. claims represented either a major intelligence failure or a
deliberate effort to mislead the American public.
   Thomas Cochran, a staff scientist with the Natural Resources
Defense Council and a member of the tour group, said Bush
administration officials were invited to go along but declined.
   Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., who participated in the tour, said Soviet
willingness to allow Americans to inspect the previously secret
laser facility and other military installations was clear evidence
of ``extraordinary steps'' being taken by Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev to promote the arms control process.
   Carr said Soviet officials told him during the tour that
legislation was being prepared to permit more public disclosures
about Soviet nuclear weapons production.

   FOOD for Africa, a pet charity of a former top
official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has
raised thousands of dollars without proper registration in several
states, according to records.
   A check by The Associated Press of the offices of state attorneys
general and other agencies regulating charities found FOOD is not
registered in New York, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, the District of
Columbia, Colorado, California, Massachusetts or its home state of
Michigan.
   The organization raised at least $580,000 from 1986 to 1988, much
of it in those states, and half of that came from individuals or
firms known to be involved with HUD programs, according to an
internal agency report released in April.
   ``I was told we didn't have to have a license,'' Vasilios
Damavolites, FOOD's treasurer, said in an interview from Novi,
Mich., where the organization is headquartered.
   Damavolites, who is president of Dial Construction Corp. and goes
by the anglicized name of Bill Damas, said contributions have been
difficult to raise since the release of a HUD report that touched on
the organization and its links to former agency official Thomas T.
Demery.
   ``We don't want to operate illegally,'' Damas said. ``We're not
going to do anything else until we receive the proper license.''
   Despite lacking appropriate state registration, FOOD holds
federal tax exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service, meaning
that donations are tax deductible.
   Damas said information about state licenses is kept by Peter
Pretorius, who runs FOOD's relief operations from his home in South
Africa. Pretorius could not be reached for comment. His secretary in
South Africa said Tuesday that Pretorius and his wife, Ann, were
attending an evangelical conference in Manila, Philippines.
   FOOD for Africa was an obscure relief organization delivering
food and clothing to war refugees in Mozambique until the release of
a HUD audit in April. The report probed possible connections between
donations to FOOD by real estate developers and contracts awarded
under HUD's Moderate Rehabilitation program.
   The HUD rehabilitation program, which gave rent subsidies to
developers to renovate housing for low-income residents, was
suspended after the audit's release because of charges of favoritism
in the awarding of contracts.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said Tuesday he had instituted new
controls and restarted the program.
   Demery's links to FOOD date to 1985, when he helped establish the
charity. He quit his position as director after he moved to HUD as
assistant secretary for housing, according to the report.
   The report said Demery continued to work for the charity,
attending at least eight fund-raisers in the 20 months after he
became assistant secretary. A check of Demery's phone logs, obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that Demery often
spoke to FOOD officials during working hours.
   After the investigation, HUD Inspector General Paul Adams
concluded that Demery may have violated the department's standards
of conduct, which prohibit employees from directly or indirectly
soliciting anything of value from anyone with ``interests that may
substantially be affected'' by HUD.
   Demery says the conclusions were based on circumstantial
evidence, and says he never asked for contributions from any HUD
developer.
   FOOD for Africa at one time held a license to solicit
contributions in its home state of Michigan, but allowed it to lapse
in September 1987, according to documents obtained from the Michigan
attorney general. A reapplication made this year has been delayed
until FOOD can provide notarized signatures of two officers, the
documents show.
   Yet FOOD held two fund-raisers in Michigan in 1988 and 1989, the
organization's treasurer said in a telephone interview this week.
FOOD also held at least 10 fundraising events in six other states
and the District of Columbia in 1987 and 1988, according to the HUD
audit.
   FOOD also filed papers with the Michigan attorney general in June
saying that it had ``pending applications in other states'' for
licenses, although Damas said he did not know which states.

<HEAD>Congress Urged to Toughen Regulations on Kids' TV</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Television is sending one message to the
nation's most impressionable viewers, says a senator _ ``buy, buy,
buy.''
   Witnesses urged Congress at a hearing Wednesday to restore
restrictions on children's TV programs and join other nations that
use television to enlighten rather than exploit the young.
   They said that since 1984, when the Federal Communications
Commission weakened time limits on advertising for children's shows,
the only messages American kids have been getting from U.S.
broadcasters are sales pitches.
   The barbs at the broadcast industry came at a hearing by the
Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee on
communications on two bills that would restore the restrictions and
give the federal government new authority over children's fare.
   ``Instead of inspiring children to learn, broadcasters are
pushing them to buy, buy, buy,'' Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, an
author of one of the bills, testified.
   Metzenbaum said commercials in children's shows have increased
since 1984 and some programs urge young viewers to dial 900
telephone numbers to hear taped messages from cartoon characters.
Unsuspecting parents then get hit with huge telephone bills.
   Dr. Francis Palumbo, representing the American Academy of
Pediatrics, contrasted U.S. television with Australia, Japan and
Great Britain, where up to six hours of instructional programming
for children is offered each day.
   ``In the United States, our commercial networks may offer one
hour each week,'' Palumbo said. He did not include figures for
public television stations.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., _ who is sponsoring a bill that goes
further than Metzenbaum's _ testified that in the wake of the
``deregulation frenzy'' of the Reagan years, ``broadcasters seem to
have abandoned educational children's programs altogether.''
   He said Congress must pressure broadcasters to ``transform
children's television from a `vast wasteland' to a source of
intellectual stimulation and enrichment for American children.''
   Wirth's bill includes provisions to:
   _Impose tougher limits on advertising time in children's TV
shows. Currently, those limits are 9.5 minutes of commercials per
hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour during weekdays.
   _Require TV stations, as part of the FCC license renewal process,
to show they are providing programming ``specifically designed to
serve the educational and informational needs of preschool and
school-aged children.''
   _Require broadcasters to give advance public notice of programs
designed specifically to educate and inform children.
   The bill by Metzenbaum and Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., is
identical to a measure that passed Congress last year, only to be
pocket-vetoed by President Ronald Reagan. A similar measure is
before the House.
   The Metzenbaum bill would hold commercials on children's shows to
10.5 minutes per hour weekends and 12 minutes weekdays, and require
stations to demonstrate to the FCC they are serving the educational
and information needs of children through their ``overall
programming.''
   Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, said his group supported the Metzenbaum bill, which he
called a ``fair and reasonable compromise.''
   He complained that broadcasters are losing young audiences to
cable TV and VCRs, while production costs for children's shows are
increasing.
   ``Further restrictions and more stringent programming
requirements run the risk of knocking the children's television
marketplace even further out of balance,'' Fritts told the
subcommittee.
   DeWitt Helm, president of the Association of National
Advertisers, opposed both bills. He called the restrictions
unconstitutional and said they don't protect children.
   Helm said there was no evidence children are any more susceptible
to five minutes of commercials than to 15 minutes of ads.

Bethesda, Md., this weekend and ask for Jim Smith, expect
exasperation.
   There will be about 50 Jim Smiths registered.
   They're members of the Jim Smith Society. They'll be attending
its annual summer get-together, reveling in what they have in common
_ a name.
   They're only a fraction of the Jim Smiths who belong to the
society. Its membership numbers 1,502, from virtually every state
and many other countries.
   And the 1,502 are just the tip of the Jim Smith iceberg. No one
knows how many Jim Smiths there are _ the Census Bureau keeps this
sort of information confidential _ but the Department of Veterans
Affairs counts more than 16,000 on its roles.
   The Jim Smith Society is the brainchild of _ this will come as no
surprise _ a gent named Jim Smith.
   A good-natured James H. Smith Jr., 68, of Camp Hill, Pa., retired
public relations man, he is the self-described
``founder-president-newsletter editor-chief bankroller.''
   He established it 20 years ago.
   No goals for this society, no high purpose, except to exist and
count noses.
   ``My membership application includes a line in which I ask
applicants to list their most significant achievement,'' founder
Smith recalls. ``One Jim responded by writing: `Living up to the
name by being completely undistinguished.'''
   No Jim Smith has ever occupied the White House, Smith concedes.
There once was a U.S. Sen. Jim Smith from New Jersey. A handful of
congressmen, a couple of governors went by that name, history shows.
   But ask him to come up with really famous Jim Smiths and he won't
bowl you over.
   Currently, he'll list the secretary of state of Florida, a
Republican who used to be a Democrat; a state senator in Alabama,
and the commissioner of the California highway patrol. That's about
it for the Jim Smith Hall of Fame.
   But the Jim Smiths have fun when they get together.
   Everybody enjoys the annual softball game _ except maybe the
scorekeeper.
   Most valuable player: Jim Smith. Winning pitcher: Jim Smith.
Losing pitcher: Jim Smith. In the bullpen: Jim Smith.
   ``We've had instances when someone inadvertently calls out, `Hey,
Jim!''' recalls Camp Hill's Jim, ``and 50 heads turn.''
   Somewhere in the club's past, it lost its purity. It began
admitting people like F. Jim Smith and R. Jim Smith.
   It started with Timmy James Smith, son of member in good standing
James Smith from somewhere in Michigan, founder Smith recalls.
   Timmy used to love coming with his dad to the summer festivals
but hated it when he had to stand by the sidelines while they took
the class picture.
   So founder Smith bent the rules; Timmy could come in if he would
go by T. Jim.
   Another Jim Smith, this one a former Army colonel from Columbus,
Ohio, designed the society T-shirt. It proclaims ``Jim Smith power.''
   On their T-shirts, Jim Smith says, the members will tell each
other apart by wearing nametags. He says it with a straight face.

<HEAD>Congress Tackles Spending, Deficit-Cutting Bills</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress is speeding up work on an assortment
of deficit-cutting and spending bills with the start of the 1990
fiscal year looming closer.
   The House passed the second of 13 annual appropriations
Wednesday, an $11 billion measure for the Interior Department and
cultural programs, on a 374-49 vote. The Senate has yet to approve
any appropriations measures, which provide money for federal
agencies.
   The House Ways and Means Committee gave preliminary voice vote
approval to a measure raising $5.3 billion in new tax receipts,
mainly by boosting a series of levies on businesses. The panel
rejected 22-11 President Bush's pet tax proposal _ a cut in the
capital gains tax that Democrats say benefits only the rich.
   But a deficit-slashing measure ran into problems in the House
Energy and Commerce Committee. The legislation would raise $50
million by increasing fees the Securities and Exchange Commission
charges investors and another $300 million by boosting Nuclear
Regulatory Commission fees imposed on utilities.
   It would also expand the Medicaid program an estimated $5 billion
to $13 billion over five years. That brought objections from Rep.
William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., who called the measure an example of
``the insidious practice of how we expand the liberal welfare
state.''
   Lawmakers returned this week from their Fourth of July recess to
eight weeks of work left until the Oct. 1 start of the next fiscal
year. They take a four-week break in August.
   They must keep the federal deficit to the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law's limit of $100 billion for 1990, out of a
$1.17 trillion budget, to prevent automatic, across-the-board cuts.
   Two House Appropriations subcommittees, meeting behind closed
doors, tried to finish spending bills for transportation programs
and for labor, health, and education initiatives.
   Across the Capitol, the Senate Appropriations Committee divided
programs worth $658 billion among its 13 subcommittees, opening the
way for those panels to begin writing their own versions of the
spending bills. Members of the committee complained that last
spring's budget deal between President Bush and congressional
leaders would not allow increases for programs that need more money.
   ``I wish we could do better, but we could only cut the cake so
many ways,'' said Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va.
   The House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service voted 23-0
for a package that claims $2.8 billion in savings. Some $1.8 billion
would come from a bookkeeping move _ shifting the Postal Service
``off-budget'' so its losses don't count towards federal red ink.
   Other claimed savings would come by shifting the date on which
the Postal Service reimburses the government $330 million for
workers compensation payments from fiscal 1991 into fiscal 1990.
Another $700 million in savings would be realized by spreading
federal civilian employees retirement payments over two years,
instead of in one single check.

<HEAD>Hastings Dim About Chances at Senate Impeachment Trial</HEAD>

   Judge Alcee L. Hastings, fighting to save his
seat on the federal bench in a Senate impeachment trial, says his
chances of winning are a long way from bright.
   ``The political reality is not good,'' the Miami jurist said
during a break in the impeachment trial Wednesday when reporters
asked how he thinks he will come out in the long run.
   ``I think I'll get a fair hearing, but I understand politics in
America,'' Hastings added. He expressed hope, however, that there
will be a surge of grassroots support for him that could improve his
chances.
   Hastings, 52, the first black federal judge in Florida history,
is accused of plotting to receive a $150,000 bribe, lying to a jury
that acquitted him of criminal charges in 1983, and improper
disclosure of information obtained from a federal wiretap.
   Hastings is accused of plotting with Washington attorney William
Borders to get the payoff in exchange for returning $845,000 in
forfeited cash to two convicted racketeers and keeping the two out
of prison.
   Hastings was impeached by the House a year ago and now is on
trial in the Senate. If convicted, he would be removed from the
bench and deprived of his judicial salary of $89,500 a year.
   A panel of 12 senators is hearing evidence in the case and will
report later to the full Senate, which will make the final decision.
   Panel members on Wednesday donned earphones to monitor tapes made
by the FBI when undercover agent H. Paul Rico met twice in September
1981 in Miami with Borders, a friend of Hastings.
   Rico _ a former agent called out of retirement for the assignment
_ was posing as Frank Romano, one of two brothers in the restaurant
business convicted of racketeering in connection with a Teamsters
pension fund loan and sentenced by Hastings to three years in prison.
   The real Frank Romano, who has since died, did not respond to
overtures sent by Borders through a go-between, according to
witnesses.
   On the tape, Rico arranged what he and Borders called a
demonstration of Borders' influence over Hastings.
   While Borders was in Las Vegas at a boxing match, Hastings was to
have dinner at the Hotel Fontainebleau in Miami Beach. Hastings did
have dinner at the hotel at the appointed time on Sept. 16, 1981. He
denies it was on Borders' instructions.
   The following Saturday, however, Rico met Borders at Miami
International Airport and is heard to say he is handing the attorney
$25,000 in cash in what prosecutors call a down payment on the
payoff.
   Borders did not discover that ``Romano'' was actually Rico until
several weeks later when he was arrested pulling out of a suburban
Virginia parking lot with the undercover agent and a garment bag
containing $125,000 in cash. He was subsequently convicted in the
case and sent to prison.
   Hastings has said repeatedly that he had nothing to do with the
bribery scheme and that Borders, a longtime friend, was ``a
rainmaker'' who was playing on their friendship to squeeze
defendants for money.
   House members acting as prosecutors at the trial questioned that
theory Wednesday after an FBI agent and a former Justice Department
strike force prosecutor testified that they witnessed two meetings
between Borders and Santo Trafficante, the late kingpin of organized
crime in Florida.

   This is not another one of those jokes
about New Jersey. It is about a museum filled with garbage.
   The Hackensack Meadowlands Environment Center's museum will
feature windows, tires, bottles, paper cartons and toys once
destined for landfills in New Jersey, which produces 26,000 tons of
trash daily _ enough to fill nearby Giants Stadium to the top of the
scoreboard every 2{ weeks.
   ``The fundamental purpose is educational. We want to show people
that garbage doesn't just disappear. That it's not just by magic,''
said Robert Grant, a spokesman for the center.
   The plans for the museum come at a time when communities across
the nation are considering ways to recycle some of their trash. A
third of the country's 6,000 dumps will close during in the next
five years, driving up disposal costs.
   The exhibit, which will be permanent and will be operated by the
Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, is under
construction. An official dedication is planned for October.
   From the garbage-filled entry, visitors will move to viewing
holes where mirrors show the trash producers themselves.
   There's a display showing something that won't decay _ a glass
bottle. Another display will explain disposal options, such as
making a compost pile at home or recycling motor oil. And computer
games on trash are planned.
   ``The purpose is to show the public what is thrown away, what
could be recycled, and what their responsibilities and concerns
should be to reduce the waste,'' said Grant.
   Each American generates an average of 3.5 pounds of refuse a day,
adding 160 million tons to the nation's trash pile each year. Only
10 percent is recycled; the federal government has set a goal of 25
percent in four years.
   ``We are trying to change habits that have been with us since man
first walked upright. ... What society has done is to find a useless
piece of land and fill it up, then find another piece of land,''
Grant said.
   ``People still think you put it out on Tuesdays and Thursdays
and, `Poof!' it disappears.''
   The development commission, created 20 years ago by the
Legislature, is responsible for environmental education, overseeing
garbage disposal has four northern New Jersey counties and managing
surrounding wetlands.
   The solid waste museum is one of three planned for the new
7,000-square-foot exhibit area, being built mostly with money from
the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which funds the
environment center. The other exhibits will show area history, and
animals and plants found in the wetlands around the center.
   The $400,000 museum will be geared to children. About 1,200
students now visit the center each month.
   Anne Galli, the commission's director of environmental
operations, said she hopes children could persuade their parents to
cut down on what they throw away. For example, she said school
lunches could be put in reusable plastic containers instead of paper
and foil.
   ``We want people to see it as a fun and also a learning
experience,'' she said during a recent tour of the half-finished
exhibit. ``While each of us is part of the problem, each of us is
part of the solution.''
   Grant said the exhibit is getting attention from foreign media,
including Japanese television stations and an Irish radio station.
   ``I think people worldwide are beginning to come to grips with
the garbage crisis,'' he said. ``A museum of trash has a lot of
anthropological and archaeological interest.''
   As visitors leave the exhibit, they'll see trash as art _
sculpture and wall hangings made out of garbage.
   ``We wanted to leave them with an upbeat feeling instead of
depressed and overwhelmed,'' Ms. Galli said. ``They leave thinking,
`I can take control of this situation by my own actions.'''

<HEAD>Painkiller Ordered Removed From Marketplace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered a prescription
painkiller removed from the marketplace because it never was
approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
   The order was issued Monday by U.S. District Judge William L.
Hungate but was not immediately made public.
   The drug _ Esgic with Codeine _ has been distributed nationally
by Forest Pharmaceuticals in Maryland Heights since 1986. It
contains 50 milligrams of butalbital, 30 milligrams of codeine, 40
milligrams of caffeine and 325 milligrams of acetaminophen. It is
described as an analgesic for coping with moderate to severe pain.
   Ken Goodman, vice president of finance for Forest Laboratories,
the parent company in New York, refused to answer any questions
about the drug, saying the matter was in litigation.
   The company contended that the drug was generally recognized by
experts as safe and therefore not a new drug requiring approval by
the FDA.
   But the FDA contended that it was not widely recognized as safe
because there were no published studies on the drug or any similar
product.
   Hungate noted that the company failed to cite any published
studies to refute the FDA's argument, and he concluded that ``where
there are no published studies, there can be no general
recognition'' of a drug as safe.
   Hungate's order suspends manufacture and distribution of the drug
or any similar product unless the FDA approves of it. He gave the
agency power to inspect Forest's facilities to ensure compliance. He
also assessed unspecified costs of the case against the company.

<HEAD>Capital Gains Tax Cut Left Out of Deficit-Reduction Plan _ For Now</HEAD>

   President Bush's proposed cut in the capital
gains tax is still alive, but the House Ways and Means Committee is
refusing for now to make it part of a deficit-reduction package.
   The committee, after giving tentative approval to a $5.3 billion
revenue increase, is putting finishing touches on the package. Aides
say the subject of capital gains likely will be raised again before
the final vote, as will an attempt to defer a new tax that finances
catastrophic health insurance.
   The revenue-increase plan, a mishmash of mostly technical changes
affecting corporations, was approved by voice vote in a closed-door
session Wednesday after the committee, by a 22-11 margin, rejected
Bush's call for a capital gains cut.
   Another voice vote eliminated a proposed one-year extension of
the 3 percent tax on telephone service, which is due to expire Dec.
31, 1990.
   Still left in the bill are increases in taxes on snuff and
chewing and pipe tobacco; imposition of income tax withholding on
some farm workers who now are exempt; a one-year extension of the 8
percent airline ticket tax and the 5 percent levy on air freight,
and imposing Social Security taxes on some deferred compensation.
   Tentatively approved but still subject to change are the biggest
revenue-raisers in the bill: repeal of special dividend and interest
deductions benefiting lenders and employers for investments in
employee stock-ownership plans.
   Those changes would bring in more than $1.6 billion of the $5.3
billion of revenue increases that the committee is under orders to
raise for deficit reduction in the budget year that begins Oct. 1.
   The committee attached a provision wiping out most of the
disputed parts of a 1986 law, known as Section 89, that requires
employers to use complex tests to prove their employee health-care
plans are not weighted in favor of higher-paid workers.
   Under the committee's action, no Section 89 provisions would be
enforced before Jan. 1. After that date, any employer-paid health
plan would be acceptable if made available to 90 percent of
employees and the employer paid at least half the premium.
   The health premium charged a worker earning under $20,000 a year
could not exceed $1,000 for a policy covering only the employee and
$2,000 for a policy covering a family.
   Small businesses would get an additional break. The health
insurance provided by an employer with fewer than 20 workers would
pass federal muster as long as the company gave coverage to all
workers and contributed the same premium for all.
   Section 89 was enacted to encourage expansion of health coverage
to more workers. The committee proposal, similar to changes approved
by the Senate, does not repeal anti-discrimination requirements;
they simply free employers from complex tests to prove their plans
are fair.
   Most of the votes against the cut in capital gains taxes, which
apply to profits from the sale of stock and other assets, were cast
by Democrats. They are wary of voting a capital gains cut because
almost all the benefits go to upper-income people.
   However, aides working for members of both parties say there is a
chance Democrats might change their minds if Bush offers to support
other tax changes that they favor.
   The administration proposed the capital gains tax cut as a way to
raise revenue. Although there is general agreement that such a
reduction would boost revenues during the first year, by encouraging
investors to sell some long-held assets, congressional economists
insist a cut would lose money later.

   A congressman outraged over artworks depicting
explicit sexuality and religious desecration says the House's
decision to strip $45,000 from the federal arts budget is ``a slap
on the wrist.''
   The House approved the cut in the National Endowment for the Arts
budget after attempts to first take away all the agency's money and
then reduce its budget by 10 percent failed.
   ``I'm afraid the long and the short of it is that they will get a
message they can get away with anything and take nothing but a
modest slap on the wrist,'' said Rep. Richard Armey, R-Texas.
   The action Wednesday came as an amendment to the $11 billion
Interior Department appropriations bill, which was eventually
approved by a 374-49 vote. The Senate has not voted on the Interior
appropriation.
   The fight over arts funding, heightened by recent controversial
exhibits that had federal money behind them, was debated for five
hours before the amendment trimming the NEA's budget was approved
361-65.
   The bill earmarked $144.2 million for the endowment, which
provides grants to artists, writers and art exhibitors.
   ``We were concerned about the way the endowment was moving on
certain taxpayer-funded projects,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm,
D-Texas, who proposed the funding cut.
   Stenholm's amendment was an alternative to one offered by Rep.
Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., that would have wiped out the NEA's
entire appropriation, and another by Armey that would have cut the
NEA budget by 10 percent.
   Armey said the vote would do force the ``arrogant'' NEA to use
``standards of taste, decency, sensitivity, tolerance'' in its arts
funding decisions.
   But Hugh Southern, acting endowment chairman, said the NEA takes
congressional concerns seriously.
   ``We shall continue to work with the Congress to assure the
integrity and effectiveness of the arts endowment processes and to
maintain the independence of the peer review system and its
affirmation of diverse aesthetic views and expressions,'' he said
after the vote.
   The fight centered around a photograph by Andres Serrano of a
plastic crucifix submerged in a container of the artist's urine, and
an exhibition of photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe that
included depiction of homo-eroticism, child nudity and sadomasochism.
   The NEA gave the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University
of Pennsylvania $30,000 to display the Mapplethorpe works, and the
Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C.,
$70,000 from which it awarded Serrano a $15,000 prize.
   The Serrano award also included funds from the Equitable
Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, said Josh Dare, spokesman
for the NEA.
   Congressional criticism grew after the Mapplethorpe photos were
included in a catalogue for an exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of
Art in Washington, D.C. The gallery withdrew Mapplethorpe's work
from the exhibition.
   Stenholm said most of the public is not aware of these works, but
``my district would be overwhelmingly opposed to them,'' he said.
``They are in such poor taste.''

   FOOD for Africa, a pet charity of a former top
official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has
raised thousands of dollars without proper registration in several
states, according to records.
   A check by The Associated Press of the offices of state attorneys
general and other agencies regulating charities found FOOD is not
registered in New York, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, the District of
Columbia, Colorado, California, Massachusetts or its home state of
Michigan.
   The organization raised at least $580,000 from 1986 to 1988, much
of it in those states, and half of that came from individuals or
firms known to be involved with HUD programs, according to an
internal agency report released in April.
   ``I was told we didn't have to have a license,'' Vasilios
Damavolites, FOOD's treasurer, said in an interview from Novi,
Mich., where the organization is headquartered.
   Damavolites, who is president of Dial Construction Corp. and goes
by the anglicized name of Bill Damas, said contributions have been
difficult to raise since the release of a HUD report that touched on
the organization and its links to former agency official Thomas T.
Demery.
   ``We don't want to operate illegally,'' Damas said. ``We're not
going to do anything else until we receive the proper license.''
   Despite lacking appropriate state registration, FOOD holds
federal tax exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service, meaning
that donations are tax deductible.
   Damas said information about state licenses is kept by Peter
Pretorius, who runs FOOD's relief operations from his home in South
Africa. Pretorius could not be reached for comment. His secretary in
South Africa said Tuesday that Pretorius and his wife, Ann, were
attending an evangelical conference in Manila, Philippines.
   FOOD for Africa was an obscure relief organization delivering
food and clothing to war refugees in Mozambique until the release of
a HUD audit in April. The report probed possible connections between
donations to FOOD by real estate developers and contracts awarded
under HUD's Moderate Rehabilitation program.
   The HUD rehabilitation program, which gave rent subsidies to
developers to renovate housing for low-income residents, was
suspended after the audit's release because of charges of favoritism
in the awarding of contracts.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said Tuesday he had instituted new
controls and restarted the program.
   Demery's links to FOOD date to 1985, when he helped establish the
charity. He quit his position as director after he moved to HUD as
assistant secretary for housing, according to the report.
   The report said Demery continued to work for the charity,
attending at least eight fund-raisers in the 20 months after he
became assistant secretary. A check of Demery's phone logs, obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that Demery often
spoke to FOOD officials during working hours.
   After the investigation, HUD Inspector General Paul Adams
concluded that Demery may have violated the department's standards
of conduct, which prohibit employees from directly or indirectly
soliciting anything of value from anyone with ``interests that may
substantially be affected'' by HUD.
   Demery says the conclusions were based on circumstantial
evidence, and says he never asked for contributions from any HUD
developer.
   FOOD for Africa at one time held a license to solicit
contributions in its home state of Michigan, but allowed it to lapse
in September 1987, according to documents obtained from the Michigan
attorney general. A reapplication made this year has been delayed
until FOOD can provide notarized signatures of two officers, the
documents show.
   Yet FOOD held two fund-raisers in Michigan in 1988 and 1989, the
organization's treasurer said in a telephone interview this week.
FOOD also held at least 10 fundraising events in six other states
and the District of Columbia in 1987 and 1988, according to the HUD
audit.
   FOOD also filed papers with the Michigan attorney general in June
saying that it had ``pending applications in other states'' for
licenses, although Damas said he did not know which states.

<HEAD>US Not Meddling in Israeli Politics, Officials Say</HEAD>

   A senior U.S. official says there have been
some unspecified contacts between Israel and its longtime enemy, the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Assistant Secretary of State John H. Kelly said Wednesday it
would be an ``exaggeration'' to say an official dialogue between the
two sides is taking place. But he added there is ``classified
reporting about contacts'' between the two sides that he would
discuss only in a closed-door session.
   Israeli officials vehemently denied any contacts with the PLO.
   Kelly's statement came in an appearance before a congressional
panel in which he also said hard-liners in Israel are damaging
prospects for elections in the occupied territories. He denied
Israeli radio reports that the United States is trying to interfere
in Israel's affairs.
   Asked about the six-month-old diplomatic talks between the PLO
and the U.S., Kelly said they have yielded no tangible results and
that the talks wouldn't go on forever.
   In Israel, Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, and Danny Naveh, spokesman for Foreign Minister Moshe Arens
denied to Israeli radio that Israel had had contacts with the PLO.
``There are no, and there will be no, contacts with the PLO,'' Naveh
was quoted as saying.
   Kelly also was asked about PLO comments on last week's attack on
an Israeli bus in which 14 civilians were killed. He said U.S.
Ambassador Robert Pelletreau was instructed last week to ``bring up
short'' Bassam Abu Sharif, the PLO spokesman who labeled the attack
a legitimate part of Palestinian resistance efforts.
   Yasser Arafat, in an interview with Hearst News Service, said
Wednesday he regretted the loss of life and denied any PLO
involvement.
   ``It is painful for me to witness the loss of all these civilian
lives,'' Arafat said in the interview.
   Kelly, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee
on Europe and the Middle East, denied that next week's high-level
State Department mission to Israel was aimed at persuading the
parties in the coalition government to stay together.
   He said the delegation, whose participants and schedule were not
yet final, would discuss future prospects for Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the subcommittee chairman, noted news
reports that the Bush administration was signaling Israeli leaders
that it hopes the Labor Party will not leave the coalition
government, and Hamilton said it was ``rather extraordinary for the
United States to inject itself into domestic politics.''
   Kelly said he was ``a little distressed at that interpretation of
the trip,'' which he said is only for the purpose of having ``a
healthy exchange'' about prospects for peace.
   ``It is not up to us to try to stage-manage domestic politics in
Israel. ... We're not going to have a public position on an issue
like that.''
   He said the United States still regards Israeli policy as
supporting the concept of elections among the 1.7 million
Palestinians under Israel's occupation in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. That is ``the operative and legally binding basis for the
Israeli government to proceed,'' he said.
   Limits that hard-liners imposed on the election proposal at a
Likud Party conference last week ``did not advance the process,''
Kelly said. ``If they became government policy ... that would make
it more difficult. But we do not believe the final act has been
played.''

<HEAD>US Team Calls for Safeguards for Soviets Sent to Mental Hospitals</HEAD>

   The Soviet Union is still hospitalizing
citizens who are not mentally ill, says a team of U.S. health
experts who recommend additional reforms to prevent confinement of
political dissidents.
   The 26-member delegation's report, released Wednesday, said broad
concepts of ``social dangerousness'' have contributed to the Soviet
practice of hospitalizing people who are not mentally ill.
   In response, the Soviet side expressed disagreement with some
aspects of the study but nonetheless called it a ``valuable and
useful document.''
   The delegation visited the Soviet Union from Feb. 26 to March 12
to assess recent changes in Soviet psychiatry. They examined 15
patients and 12 former patients who had been released within the
preceding two years.
   Among the 12, ``the U.S. team found no evidence of any past or
current mental disorder in nine, and the remaining three had
relatively mild symptoms that would not typically warrant
involuntary hospitalization,'' said delegation member Darrel A.
Regier, director of clinical research at the National Institute of
Mental Health.
   The delegation's report said it ``recommends that additional
steps be taken to revise the Soviet Criminal Codes to remove all
prohibitions against expression of political or religious beliefs.''
   In addition, the report said new legislation or regulations
appear necessary to limit involuntary hospitalizations solely to
those who are a direct danger to themselves or others.
   The report also recommended increased use of defense lawyers to
guard against abuse of patients, and the use of periodic reviews to
ensure that hospital stays are not excessively long.
   According to the report, the Soviet hosts generally complied with
the terms of the agreement under which the visit was made although
there were some ``significant procedural obstacles'' that made
completing the task more difficult.
   The preliminary Soviet response to the report acknowledged the
existence of such obstacles but said the problem ``by no means meant
that the Soviet specialists artificially created difficulties and
tried to limit access to the necessary information on the patients.''
   The Soviet response said efforts are being made to bring Soviet
laws into conformity with international standards.
   In addition, it said, there has been discussion of the creation
of an independent commission ``to examine any and all complaints of
wrongful acts by employees of the psychiatric service, and for
public monitoring of the activity of psychiatric institutions.''
   The U.S. team made the visit against a background of allegations
about misuse of psychiatric treatment in the Soviet Union. One
report cited 346 cases of alleged psychiatric abuse between 1977 and
1983.
   The perception that the problem was rampant prompted the World
Psychiatric Association to condemn Moscow in 1977 for the alleged
practices.
   Faced with expulsion from the group, the Soviet All-Union Society
of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists resigned from the WPA in 1983.
   But the American delegation acknowledged there has been progress
in recent years toward establishing some legal protection for
patients subject to forced confinement.

<HEAD>Northrop Division Temporarily Suspended By Air Force</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A division of the Northrop Corp. won't be
allowed to do business with the government because of alleged fraud
connected to two weapons systems the division worked on.
   Precision Product Division of Norwood, Mass., was suspended
temporarily because of criminal charges brought last spring over the
division's work on the flight data transmitter for the air-launched
cruise missile and a stabilization system for the Navy's AV-8B
Harrier jet, Northrop said Wednesday.
   The suspension is temporary pending completion of the legal
proceedings, according to the Air Force letter informing Northrop of
the suspension.
   The letter, obtained by The Associated Press, said the indictment
returned in the federal court in Los Angeles alleged Northrop and
others ``conspired to defraud the government by knowingly supplying
untested and out-of-specification flight stabilization and control
packages and making false, fictitious and fraudulent statements and
representations'' regarding the cruise missile and the Harrier jet.
   The suspension involves only future business at Precision
Products, not contracts elsewhere at Northrop or contracts at
Precision on which work is now underway. The company said the
division accounts for about 2{ percent of sales and less than 4
percent of its $5 billion order backlog.
   Northrop is a major defense contractor, building the new B-2
``stealth'' bomber.
   Northrop spokesman Loye Miller called the government's charges
``unwarranted and exaggerated,'' and the suspension ``unnecessary.''
   ``The company intends to provide information in opposition to the
government's temporary suspension of the unit,'' the statement said.
   Northrop's statement said the company has taken ``strong
actions'' to assure that it is a responsible contractor, including
the closure of a facility in Pomona, Calif., and the dismissal of
several employees.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the world's seven major industrial
democracies gather in Paris on Friday for their 15th annual economic
summit, surrounded by France's bicentennial hoopla and with a
comfortable sense of economic self-satisfaction.
   The oil crises, inflationary pressures, monetary instability and
other woes that dominated previous summits seem contained, giving
the government leaders time to take an unhurried look at matters
such as the environment and Third World debt.
   The surge in the dollar that started in June, sending economic
shivers down the backs of many a government official, has been
cooled after massive intervention by central banks selling dollars.
   An optimistic U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady emphasized
the Western economies are doing well and the coordination process
among the seven _ the United States, Canada, Japan, West Germany,
France, Italy and Britain _ is working. There is no need for
tinkering during the three-day summit beginning Friday, he said.
   ``The summit is taking place in a period of growth,'' noted
Jacques Attali, a special adviser to French President Francois
Mitterrand. ``The discussions will be on how to manage this growth.''
   Lack of an immediate economic crisis is good news for debtor
nations and the Third World in general. While debt is not a new
subject for the seven, this year it will be the ``priority of
priorities,'' according to Attali.
   Both Mitterrand and Brady are pushing plans that involve
forgiving part of Third World debts in exchange for guarantees that
the rest will be paid. Nobody opposes the idea, but there are
differences over where to find the money to finance the plan.
   Mitterrand long has cast himself as the champion of the poor,
underdeveloped and indebted. He hopes the summit will end with a
``Paris plan'' for debt reduction. In May, he announced France will
forgive 16 billion francs, the equivalent of about $2.5 billion, in
public debt owed by Africa's 35 poorest countries.
   President Bush recently said the United States will forgive about
$1 billion in debt owed by 16 sub-Saharan African nations starting
Oct. 1.
   Bush, making his first outing at a ``Big 7'' summit, on Monday
proposed a $100 million American aid package to help private
entrepreneurs in Poland, coupled with debt relief and new loans.
Bush said he will be seeking similar funds from the other
participants at the Paris summit.
   On Wednesday, Bush announced an aid package for Hungary, which
includes plans to ask Congress for $25 million in new aid to spur
that country's moves toward a free-market economy.
   The French expect Washington to make a major debt initiative at
the summit.
   Not everybody is enchanted with the idea of holding the summit of
the world's richest countries at the same time as the celebration of
the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution that overthrew the
monarchy. Some believe the bicentennial celebrations ignore today's
politically and economically oppressed.
   Thousands of people demonstrated and tens of thousands attended a
protest concert Saturday organized by the French singer Renaud.
   Leaders of 31 countries are to attend the bicentennial
celebrations, which include a series of lunches, dinners,
ceremonies, parades and receptions.
   As is usual with these summits, politics will be the first item
on the menu. French officials stress that the seven leaders will
talk about anything that interests them, but that it is virtually
certain that the situation in China and Poland will be at the top of
the political list, along with the Middle East and terrorism.
   A joint political statement probably will be issued in addition
to a final communique.
   The themes for the summit are the classic ones: economic and
monetary cooperation, trade, protectionism and development.
Mitterrand also wants a discussion on the laundering of drug money.
   But the new topic, and the one being emphasized here after the
question of debt, is the environment.
   The French, in particular, want to get into detail on air and
water pollution and action that can be taken in cases such as the
Alaska oil spill.

   Doctors said he would never smile and would
be lucky to live more than a few weeks, but a boy born without a
brain is now 5 years old and laughs at Disney Channel programs, says
his adoptive mother.
   ``Andrew just glows,'' said Kaye J. Vandal. ``He laughs, he
giggles, he smiles. He has an outgoing, bubbly personality that
really draws people to him.''
   Doctors ``said he would never smile, never respond, never grow,''
Ms. Vandal said. ``All those things have proved to be untrue.''
   Andrew, who celebrated his 5th birthday Wednesday, is in
excellent health, said Ms. Vandal, a pediatric nurse who lives in
Wallingford, Conn.
   ``He had not even had a cold until this past year when he
developed the flu,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``But he got
over it in normal fashion and went back to nursery school.''
   Soon after Andrew was born in Roanoke, doctors ran tests that
showed he had no brain. A cyst had formed at the stem of the brain
and kept the rest of it from forming, leaving his skull filled with
fluid _ a condition known as hydranencephaly.
   He survived because the brain stem contains the nerve center that
controls breathing and circulation. The parts of the brain that
allow humans to think and coordinate muscular movement _ the
cerebrum and cerebellum _ never formed.
   Dr. Robert T. Leshner, a professor of neurology and pediatrics at
the Medical College of Virginia, said there is no known treatment
for hydranencephaly and that the prognosis for such patients is poor.
   Most children with the condition ``don't make it past the first
year of life,'' he said. The cause of the condition is not known.
   Andrew's biological mother had decided before his birth that she
would give up her child for adoption.
   Foster parents took care of the boy for five months while the
Richmond-based Children's Home Society of Virginia, a private
adoption agency, searched for prospective parents.
   ``Andrew was the hardest adoption I ever did,'' said Sharon E.
Peterson, the society's director of development. ``We decided we're
not putting this kid in an institution. We're going to place him.''
   Ms. Vandal sought to adopt Andrew after reading a newspaper story
about him.
   Andrew, who is 3 feet tall, weighs 32 pounds and has golden,
curly hair and blue eyes, will start his third year of nursery
school in the fall, Ms. Vandal said.
   ``Other children treat him wonderfully. He participates in all
activities other children do, and is very much a part of
everything,'' she said.
   Ms. Vandal has two girls with conditions similar to Andrew's. One
is 12 years old, the other 3. She said all three will never walk or
be able to sit or stand unsupported.
   Andrew ``is constantly on the move,'' she said. ``He lies on the
floor on his back and kicks around the floor. As soon as we open the
sliding glass door, he heads right out the door and onto the porch.''
   Andrew cannot speak and is cortically blind, which means images
are being seen but not interpreted.
   Still, said Ms. Vandal, ``he laughs when he watches the Disney
Channel on TV.''
   Ms. Vandal, a single parent, lives with her parents. They help
care for the children.
   ``We let him do what he wants to do,'' she said. ``The more he
does, the more he gains. I'm not sure how long that will go on, but
it hasn't stopped yet. We're giving him the best quality of life for
however long he lives.''

   The Navy says its safety record is ``second to
none,'' even though its submarines have been involved at least 42
collisions with other vessels since 1983.
   Navy spokesman Cmdr. Mark Baker said Wednesday that the number
includes 15 incidents with other U.S. Navy vessels and work boats,
including minor collisions with the tugboats that help a sub enter a
harbor.
   Baker was commenting on a report in the Long Beach, Calif.,
Press-Telegram over the weekend that said Navy documents revealed
that the service's submarines have been involved at least 42
collisions with other vessels, including five fishing boats, since
1983.
   In the most serious incident, the attack submarine USS Houston
snagged a towing cable of the commercial tugboat Barcona off Long
Beach last month. The tug was sunk and one member of the three-man
crew drowned.
   The Navy has that case under investigation.
   Baker said the Barcona fatality ``is the only one that we know
of.''
   The spokesman said a Navy study of collisions involving
submarines from 1983 to 1987 found that five collisions had occurred
with other submarines, one with a destroyer and one with a rescue
salvage ship.

<NOTE>Senate Panel Approves Health Insurance Bill</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee has approved a measure by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to require American employers to provide
health insurance to all their workers and their workers' dependents.
   The measure cleared Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee
on a 9-7 party-line vote Wednesday. But it's strongly opposed by the
administration and other powerful groups, including many business
organizations.
   The Kennedy bill is intended to provide coverage for the
estimated 37 million Americans not now covered by any public or
private health insurance.
   Although many of the details have been reworked, the bill is
similar to one that cleared the committee last year but was not
considered in either the full Senate or House.
   Kennedy noted that the majority of businesses already insure
their workers, ``yet two-thirds of all the Americans who lack basic
health insurance protection are workers or members of working
families.''
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, argued against the measure in a
letter to Kennedy, saying enactment of his bill ``would result in a
significant loss of job opportunities, impair our nation's economic
competitiveness, and interfere with the right of employees and
employers to determine between themselves the most appropriate
compensation package to meet their circumstances.''

<NOTE>Cable Association Says Baseball Growing on Local TV, Too</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local television stations, not just cable TV
networks, are increasing the number of Major League baseball games
they carry, a cable TV group says.
   The National Cable Television Association on Wednesday disputed
claims that cable companies are stealing baseball from ``free TV.''
   Local broadcast coverage of professional baseball has grown by
nearly 40 percent over the past 15 years, from 1,190 games in 1975
to 1,647 games in 1989, the association said.
   The number of baseball games televised by both local broadcast
stations and by regional cable sports networks has increased 7
percent since 1985, the NCTA said.
   ``As a result, cable's baseball coverage has served to
supplement, rather than reduce, the number of games aired by local
broadcasters,'' the cable association said in a report,
``Availability of Baseball Games on Broadcast and Cable Television.''
   It said some broadcasters have contended that baseball on cable
has reduced the number of games carried by local television stations.

<TEXT>
   National Guardsmen have joined police in
their battle against violent, drug-dealing gangs from Los Angeles
that have wreaked havoc on Portland's north side.
   Mayor Bud Clark and state officials said Wednesday the first of
36 National Guardsmen reported to work late last week with the
Portland Police Bureau and the Oregon State Police.
   The rest will join the ranks by the end of this week and eight
others will be on call, said the guard's director, Gen. Fred Rees.
   The guardsmen will fill support roles, acting as Spanish
interpreters, taking telephone tips and doing paperwork. That will
enable police to deploy more officers on the streets.
   Portland is beset by gang violence, with five killings blamed on
drive-by gang shootings since August.
   There have been about four dozen gang-related shootings this
year, including one Tuesday night that seriously wounded a
13-year-old boy.
   ``It's clearly a problem,'' said Gregg Kantor, Governor Neil
Goldschmidt's spokesman. ``It's not as big as Los Angeles' gang
problem, but it is very serious for us and one we don't intend to
tolerate.''
   Officials have not decided how long the guardsmen will remain in
Portland, but the effort has federal financing through October.
   ``It's just one more increment, one more step,'' Robert Jackson,
the governor's anti-crime coordinator, said at a news conference.
``The gang problem is bigger than this; the narcotics problem is
bigger than this.''
   Drive-by gang shootings were unheard of in the Pacific Northwest
until last summer, when the rival drug-dealing Crips and Bloods
gangs began expanding from Los Angeles to Portland and other cities.
   Turf battles ensued and the region's first fatal drive-by gang
shooting occurred last Aug. 17.
   ``We're not going to walk away from this saying 36 or 40 troops
is enough until we have gotten rid of the drug problem in Oregon and
specifically in Portland,'' Jackson said.
   Portland Deputy Chief Dan Noelle said the guardsmen will free up
more officers for street deployments.
   ``In terms of looking at raw numbers, it's not a big deal,''
Noelle said, but in terms of support work, ``it's a real asset.''
   The state received $474,000 from the Department of Defense to use
the National Guard to fight crime. About half that money will be
used to pay troops in Portland through Sept. 30, Rees said.
   Congress specifically said the National Guard could be used only
for support when it passed an act giving states $300 million for
anti-drug efforts, Rees said.
   ``The National Guard is not supposed to be in the arrest or
seizure business,'' he said.

   A grand jury indicted 13 people on charges
they conspired to defraud a federally subsidized housing program
that was designed to help low-income residents become homeowners.
   The indictments, which followed a two-year investigation of a
Brookhaven program called Save-a-House, were handed up Wednesday.
Two of the 13 charged are former law enforcement officers.
   ``We're talking about people that would steal the pennies off a
dead man's eyes,'' said Suffolk County District Attorney Patrick
Henry.
   The charges come at a time of numerous reports of fraud,
corruption and influence-peddling in similar programs funded by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development across the country.
   Under the Save-a-House program, 18 houses were designated to be
sold to low-income families for $500 each.
   The indictment alleges that 14 of these homes were fraudulently
obtained for between $500 to $5,000 by people representing
themselves as eligible recipients under the HUD guidelines.
   ``These people are devoid of any conscience,'' Henry said. ``The
sad part is that they deprived deserving families of a roof over
their heads.''
   A source close to the investigation who spoke on condition of
anonymity said that the investigation was proceeding into all
housing programs in Suffolk County that received federal funds
during the past eight years.
   More indictments are expected, the source said.
   All of the people who allegedly bought the houses fraudulently
were either close friends or relatives of three of the defendants:
Thomas Brazier, 43, of Westhampton, a former U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms agent; Albert Iannuzzi, 45, of Smithtown, a
former Suffolk police officer; and Garrett Story, 50, of Bellport.
   They were charged with grand larceny.
   The three defendants still control the houses through their real
estate companies and rented out the houses for an average of $800 a
month, in some cases to people whose rent is subsidized by welfare.
   James O'Rourke, defense attorney for Brazier and Iannuzzi, said
the charges were part of a vendetta against his clients.
   ``They didn't do anything illegal, or criminal,'' O'Rourke said.
``An opportunity was presented and they took advantage of an
opportunity.''
   The 13 each pleaded innocent at arraignments in Suffolk County
Court. Some were released on their own recognizances. Others had
bail set from between $5,000 to $25,000.
   Only one of the 13 was not a friend or relative of Brazier,
Iannuzzi, or Story.
   Linda Spahr, the assistant district attorney who led the probe,
said that investigators are still searching for the county employee
who approved the applications for the houses.

<HEAD>Growth Hormone Speeds Wound Healing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ointment that makes skin grow faster can speed
up nature's healing process and could capture a substantial share of
the billion dollar market for wound care products, researchers
reported today.
   The experimental treatment is based on a natural substance called
epidermal growth factor that is produced through gene splicing.
   In a report on the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors found
that it could cut more than a day off the healing time of people
undergoing skin grafts.
   ``It had always been taught in medical school that you could not
stimulate wounds to heal faster,'' said Dr. Gregory L. Brown, who
directed the study. ``We set out to show that you could.''
   The hormone was produced for this experiment by Chiron, a
biotechnology firm in Emeryville, Calif.
   ``To the best of our knowledge, no one has ever before made a
claim for a prescription drug on the basis of its favorable effect
on wound healing,'' according to an editorial in the journal.
   The editorial, by Drs. Thomas K. Hunt and Frederick B. La Van of
the University of California, San Francisco, said the latest
research appears to be the long-awaited first carefully conducted
study showing that the approach actually works.
   ``The annual market for products used in the care of wounds in
this country is more than $1 billion, and a successful growth
factor-based product would be expected to capture a substantial
share of the market,'' they wrote.
   Brown and colleagues conducted the study on 12 people being
treated for burns and broken legs at Emory and Vanderbilt
universities. Each patient received separate applications of cream
on side-by-side wounds where skin had been removed for grafts. One
application contained the growth factor, the other did not.
   In every patient, the wound getting the hormone healed faster.
The healing time varied from person to person, but on average the
wounds getting the growth factor completely healed in about 11 days,
while those without the treatment took 1{ days longer.
   Brown said that while the benefits of the treatment were minor
for these people, the study was a necessary first step to
demonstrate that the hormone actually spurs healing the way
scientists had theorized.
   ``The important thing is to show efficacy and then to open
different areas where is it clinically more important,'' he said.
   Brown noted that the treatment could help save the lives of
people who have extensive burns and little skin available for
grafts. Doctors must repeatedly harvest skin from the same unburned
area, allowing time for healing in between.
   Brown also said he has used the treatment on two people with
burns over 80 percent of their bodies. With the growth hormone,
doctors were able to take skin from the same area five times, while
ordinarily they would have only been able to do so three times.
   Brown said the hormone also may heal chronic wounds, bed sores or
diabetic ulcers. He speculated that someday it might even be sold
over the counter to help clear up minor cuts and burns.

   Three East German soccer stars defected
just hours before their team played a Swedish club in an
international cup match, the Swedish team manager said today.
   The leaders of the East German first division club Wismut Aue and
their Swedish hosts Orgryte IF believed the three; one member of the
national team and two from the junior national team left the country
Wednesday.
   ``They are probably already in West Germany,'' Orgryte's manager
Lennart Magnusson said.
   He said the players asked for their passports Wednesday to go
shopping. When they did not show up before the game, their hotel
rooms were searched and found empty.
   ``It's very sad. The East German leaders were in despair and said
they would lose their jobs,'' Magnusson said.
   ``East German teams may never be able to come here again,'' he
added.
   The team left Sweden early today without the missing players.
   Orgryte won the match 2-0.

<HEAD>Questions Raised About Authenticity of Warhol's Superman Collages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The authenticity of 19 Superman collages by Andy
Warhol has been called into question by two comic book experts who
say the Superman cut-outs didn't appear in print until years after
the date on the artworks.
   ``Either they were misdated or somebody has made some work that
is not what it purports to be,'' said Robert Miller, a New York art
dealer who owns 18 of the collages.
   The discrepancy was detected by comic book experts Arlen Schumer
and Richard Sheinaus during independent visits to a Warhol
retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which ran
from Feb. 6 to May 2.
   Schumer said in a telephone interview Monday he was looking in
the exhibition catalog at an untitled Superman collage, dated
1960-61, when he recognized the inking style of the artist who did
the cartoon panel.
   ``I remembered that Jack Abel did not start inking Superman until
the late 1960s, maybe 1969. And I thought `Hold it, something is
wrong here!'''
   ``When I met Sheinaus a month later, he said, `Did you notice
anything funny about the Warhol exhibition?''' Schumer said. ``I
looked him right in the eye and said `One has got to be a fraud.'
   ``He said, `You won't believe this but there are about 15 of
them.'''
   The series of 19 collages has been estimated to be worth about $5
million. Each piece was signed twice and dated 1960-61. The DC
Comics they came from _ like ``Superman's Greatest Blunder'' (1968)
and ``Muto vs. the Man of Tomorrow'' (1966) _ sold for 12 cents each.
   Seven of the collages _ cut-outs from original comic books that
were pasted on paper and splattered with red or blue paint _ were on
display during the MOMA retrospective; six were loaned by Miller,
one by an unidentified private collector, said Jeanne Collins, a
museum spokeswoman.
   In a statement, the museum said, ``Works of art are selected for
exhibitions based on careful research and on the best information
available at the time.
   ``In any retrospective of an artist there may be questions
regarding dating; however, we have no reason whatsoever to doubt the
authenticity of any of the works included in the Andy Warhol
retrospective,'' it said.
   Edward Hayes, a lawyer for the Warhol estate, said that the
discrepancy in dating was being investigated but that a preliminary
examination indicated the collages were authentic.
   However, Vincent Fremont, a director of the estate, told the San
Francisco Chronicle, which reported on the mismatch in dates on
Monday, that he didn't recall seeing the collages during the '60s
and '70s.
   ``I've worked with Andy since I was 18, and you didn't see them
being bought and sold,'' he said. ``You see what I am saying?''
   Gerard Malanga, who in 1963 became Warhol's first studio
assistant, said he saw the collages for the first time at the
exhibition.
   ``I was fascinated because I knew almost everything Andy was
doing at that time, and I thought `Why didn't I know about these
things?'''
   He said that later when he learned about the discrepancy in
dates, he doubted that the works were Warhol's.
   ``Those pieces require someone to sit down at a kitchen table
with scissors and glue,'' he said. ``Andy would not have taken the
time to do something like that.''
   He also noted that during 1961-62, Warhol's comic book images
were paintings not collages. Warhol quit using comic book images
after about 1962, when he learned Roy Lichtenstein was also using
them.
   Malanga also noted that Warhol often had his assistants sign his
works for him.

<HEAD>Leningrad Party Chief Becomes First Soviet Leader Ousted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: LEADS with six grafs to ADD reasons for unhappiness with Solovyov,
his age. Picks up 6th pvs, `Gorbachev had ...' ^By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The immensely unpopular chief of Leningrad's
Communist Party has been removed from the post, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev announced, calling the move a critical step in the
democratization of the ruling party.
   The official, Yuri Solovyov, was rejected by voters in March
elections for the new Congress despite running unopposed. It was an
embarrassing vote of no confidence; a majority of voters scratched
his name off the ballot.
   The 60-year-old Solovyov, who had headed the country's second
most powerful regional party organization, is also likely to lose
his seat on the party's 20-member ruling Politburo.
   Gorbachev had gone to Leningrad to oversee the leadership change
and announced that Solvyov was being replaced by Boris Gidaspov, a
56-year-old industrial chemist credited with economic innovation.
   Voters in Leningrad, the country's second-largest city with 4.8
million residents, rejected virtually their entire party leadership
in the historic spring elections for the Congress of People's
Deputies.
   Solovyov has shared the blame with other Leningrad officials for
pollution in the region and taking a hard line on dissent.
   Gorbachev said the Leningrad party Central Committee's decision
Wednesday to retire Solovyov is a critical step in ``developing the
process of democratization of the internal life of the entire
party.''
   In an extraordinary television interview that included both
Solovyov and Gidaspov, the Soviet leader said the decision to change
leadership came in response to party dissatisfaction.
   The president, who had promoted Solovyov to the Politburo three
years ago, said the party is lagging in its efforts to restructure
the Soviet Union.
   ``Many things are not being solved in the proper time, and this
is due to the fact that the party itself does not act in time,'' he
said.
   Gorbachev's statement followed several days of similar comments
in the Soviet press, including the Communist Party daily Pravda.
   After the March election defeat of 12 members of the Leningrad
leadership, a poll found that 68 percent of the city's residents and
66 percent of its party members did ``not believe the current party
leadership has the ability to radically change the situation in the
city.''
   Solovyov, seated next to Gorbachev in the television interview,
said the most important task he leaves for his successor is
increasing the authority of the party on a democratic basis and
``eliminating its complacency.''
   In April, Gorbachev sharply reprimanded Solovyov at a Kremlin
meeting for complaining that the party had lost its unity and was
becoming ``a discussion club.''
   Gidaspov, who was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies,
has been touted as a leader in economic experimentation for his work
as head of an enterprise that runs joint ventures of several
industries without interference from Moscow ministries.
   In the television interview, Gidaspov promised to open discussion
of the city's problems to a variety of groups, including
environmentalists.
   He said 18th-century central Leningrad, marked by crumbling
pastel facades, should be restored.

<HEAD>Dollar Drops In Tokyo, Stocks Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen in quiet
trading in Tokyo today, while stock prices slipped.
   The dollar closed at 139.05 yen, down 1.45 yen from its finish on
Wednesday. After opening lower at 139.63 yen, the U.S. currency
ranged between 138.82 and 139.68 yen.
   Currency dealers said the market was quiet as players waited for
the release of U.S. economic figures, including producer prices for
June, retail sales and industrial production, all due out Friday.
   ``There was some profit-taking, causing the dollar's fall,'' said
Masato Sanjo, a dealer in the Tokyo office of Manufacturers' Hanover
Trust.``But I don't expect any major movements in the market until
the release of economic indicators tomorrow.''
   Another dealer said a comment Wednesday by the governor of the
Bank of Japan also encouraged the dollar-selling. Satoshi Sumita
reportedly told journalists that the U.S. currency was still too
strong against the yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which shed 45.25 points Wednesday, lost another
70.36 points, or 0.20 percent, closing at 33,631.16.
   Securities dealers said the recent strong performance of overseas
stock exchanges was encouraging investors on the Tokyo market, but
the low volume of trading reflected investors' lack of interest and
concern over continuing political uncertainties in Japan.
   ``The external environment is not too bad, but investors find it
hard to particapate in trading as long as political uncertainties
persist,'' said Ichitaro Watanabe, a dealer for Nikko Securities.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party's majority in the upper
house of the Diet, Japan's parliament, is widely seen in jeopardy in
upcoming elections because of the party's involvement in scandals
and a public uproar over an unpopular 3 percent consumption tax
which began April 1.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, which lists
major issues, was estimated at 550 million shares, compared with
Wednesday's 600 million shares.

<HEAD>Mentally Retarded Killers: One Spared Electric Chair, Second Awaits
Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A killer was spared the electric chair as state
justices reviewed conflicting laws on executing mentally retarded
people, while federal judges considered the same issue in the case
of an Alabama killer.
   The cases followed the U.S. Supreme Court decision two weeks ago
that allows states to execute mentally retarded murderers as long as
sentencing juries or judges have considered the defendant's mental
condition.
   The Georgia Supreme Court voted 4-3 Wednesday to delay the
scheduled execution of Son Fleming, who was sentenced to die for the
1976 slaying of a Georgia police chief. The stay came Wednesday five
hours before the 59-year-old Fleming was to go to the electric chair.
   In the second case, attorneys for murderer-rapist Horace Franklin
Dunkins Jr. turned today to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta in a bid to halt his execution at 12:01 a.m. Friday in
Alabama. The lawyers claim Dunkins is mentally retarded.
   A U.S. District judge on Wednesday turned down the appeal.
   In the Fleming case, a new Georgia law bans executions of the
mentally retarded but it does not apply retroactively. Fleming's
death warrant runs for a week, and he could be executed at any time
during that period if the court rules by then. Court officials said
the review could take several days.
   Fleming's IQ scores range from 64 to 72; a person with an IQ of
70 is considered mentally handicapped.
   ``The execution of the mentally retarded in Georgia is cruel and
unusual punishment,'' said Fleming's attorney, Ken Shapiro. ``There
should be no fine line between those who happen to be tried in 1989
and those who happen to be tried in 1976. That's an arbitrary
distinction, happenstance that should not be applicable.''
   On Tuesday, the Pardons and Paroles Board rejected Fleming's
appeal for clemency. Board chairman Wayne Snow said the decision was
made on grounds that Fleming was aware of the consequences of his
actions, no matter what his IQ.
   Snow said the U.S. Supreme Court decision also was a factor in
the board's decision.
   Fleming, of Rochelle, was convicted along with Henry Willis III
of killing Ray City Police Chief Ed Giddens in 1976. Willis was
executed May 18. Fleming's nephew, Larry Fleming, is serving a life
sentence for murder in the case.
   Dunkins' attorneys, meanwhile, argued his execution should be
halted on grounds that a jury didn't consider Dunkins' alleged
mental deficiency during his 1981 trial. In court documents,
Dunkins' IQ was listed at 69.
   In Wednesday's denial of a stay of execution, U.S. District Judge
James Hancock said that even if jurors didn't consider Dunkins'
mental condition, the trial judge did. The judge sentenced Dunkins
to die in Alabama's electric chair.
   Alabama has no state law prohibiting the execution of the
mentally retarded.
   A jury convicted Dunkins in May 1981 of capital murder in the
rape and slaying of Lynn McCurry, a 26-year-old mother of four from
Warrior, Ala.

   Supreme Court Justice John Paul
Stevens said death penalty cases are ``a very severe burden on the
judicial system'' and questioned whether executions deter crime.
   Stevens, speaking Wednesday to the annual conference of the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, said states should consider the
judicial burden when the issue of capital punishment arises.
   ``I would think from time to time, when legislators confront
whether the capital sentencing, whole death-penalty business, is
really worth the cost, one of the elements of the costs that ought
to be factored into the equation is the very severe burden on the
judicial system, both state and federal,'' Stevens said.
   He cited the Supreme Court's emergency hearings on requests for
stays of execution. The hearings are often late at night.
   ``As the number of executions is continuing to increase ... one
can raise the question whether they're really doing all that much to
deter crime,'' Stevens said.
   Asked afterward whether he thought the burdens of the death
penalty on the legal system outweighed the benefits, Stevens said,
``There is a serious question,'' and declined to comment further.
   Stevens, a 1975 appointee of President Ford, has voted to allow
some executions but dissented from the court's recent rulings that
allowed states to execute 16-year-olds and mentally retarded adults.
   On another topic, Stevens said the court wasn't affected by the
flood of letters before last week's abortion ruling.
   The only problem was ``sorting that stuff out and throwing it in
the wastebasket, because nobody read any of it,'' said Stevens, who
voted against the decision that gave states to more power to
regulate abortions.

<HEAD>Beginnings of Ozone Loss Detected Over Arctic, Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists said today they have found a
high-altitude deficit in ozone over the Arctic, revealing what may
be an early step toward periodic ozone depletions like those seen
over Antarctica.
   Arctic depletions would be smaller than those forming the annual
``ozone hole'' over Antarctica, said D.J. Hofmann, a University of
Wyoming physicist and an author of the study published in the
British journal Nature.
   But ``anytime man can perturb the natural ozone profile in any
way I think we should be worried,'' he said. ``Then we're in a
situation where we (can) better know ... exactly how we're doing it,
so that we can correct it.''
   Manmade chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons are blamed for
destroying ozone, a form of oxygen found high in the atmosphere.
Ozone blocks ultraviolet rays that cause skin cancer, so scientists
are concerned by signs of ozone loss.
   The Antarctic hole is an area in which up to 50 percent of
atmospheric ozone disappears for a limited time. In the Arctic,
perhaps 25 percent could disappear under highly unusual worst-case
circumstances, said Hofmann, who conducted the study with scientists
from France, Japan, New Zealand and the University of Houston.
   Previous studies also have suggested ozone depletions over the
Arctic.
   The study does not prove that the observed deficit is an early
step in ozone depletion, but it is very suggestive, said James
Friend, an atmospheric chemistry professor at Drexel University in
Philadelphia.
   ``I think they're probably right, but they have a lot of
suppositions,'' Friend said.
   The new observations were made by balloon-borne instruments
launched last January in northern Sweden. The instruments detected
the apparent ozone deficit at altitudes between about 14 miles and
16 miles.
   The Antarctic ozone hole develops as such high-level deficits
spread to lower altitudes, where most polar ozone is found, Hofmann
said in a telephone interview.
   But the Arctic atmosphere presents obstacles to that process,
Hofmann said.
   One is that a funnel-like wind pattern needed for the deficits to
spread tends to break down in the Arctic, in contrast to its
stability in the Antarctic. In fact, researchers reported, this
pattern disintegrated soon after the high-altitude ozone deficit was
discovered.
   Another barrier is that very low temperatures needed for
destruction of ozone do not typically appear in the Arctic at lower
altitudes where ozone is depleted in Antarctica, Hofmann said.
   But Arctic air is cold enough at higher altitudes, and if the
crucial wind pattern remained stable, perhaps 25 percent of
atmospheric ozone could be destroyed over an affected area, he said.
That situation is highly unlikely, he said.
   The deficit, which appeared under conditions unusually favorable
for ozone depletion, represents about a 3 percent decline, he said.

<TEXT>
   Although it's said Ernest Hemingway may
have felt his hometown was Death in the Afternoon, this Chicago
suburb is planning a Moveable Feast to honor the writer on what
would have been his 90th birthday.
   ``He was a failure as a person, but as a writer, he was the
greatest,'' Morris Buske, historian of Oak Park's Hemingway
Foundation, said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
   ``He antagonized people. At his death he had few friends. He was
a braggart, he was cruel. He was basically insecure.''
   Then why honor such a person?
   ``Because he was the great writer,'' said Buske. ``It appears
more and more that he was the best American writer of this century.''
   Ernest Miller Hemingway _ Nobel Prize-winning author of ``Death
in the Afternoon,'' ``A Moveable Feast,'' ``The Sun Also Rises,''
``For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' ``A Farewell to Arms'' and ``The Old
Man and the Sea'' _ was born July 21, 1899, in Oak Park and lived
here until he was 18.
   Every July, the foundation marks the occasion with a week of
events. This year, a new U.S. postage stamp with Papa's portrait on
it will be presented.
   ``The biggest thing is the stamp, which will appear first in Key
West on July 17 and in Oak Park on July 21,'' said Buske.
   ``The Post Office announced they were issuing the stamp in Key
West _ his home in later life _ and when we found about it, we
raised such a fuss, they caved in and agreed to let us in on the
event. It's unusual for a bureaucracy.''
   On July 21, Hemingway's son Jack will speak at a ceremony at the
Oak Park Post Office dedicating the stamp.
   The weeklong birthday tribute begins Friday with a Bastille Day
street party at a restaurant.
   Also scheduled are: a Hemingway film festival introduced by
another son, Patrick; tours of the two houses the writer-to-be lived
in; a gourmet picnic at $40 a person with menu items from
granddaughter Joan's cookbook; and a family reunion of the burly
writer's two sons and assorted nieces, nephews and in-laws.
   Buske said Oak Parkers who don't like Hemingway are quick to
quote a line attributed to the bearded writer, that the suburb has
``broad lawns and narrow minds.''
   But Buske said he has done extensive research and has never been
able to confirm Hemingway ever said such a thing.
   Scott Schwar, chairman of the Hemingway Foundation, said the
quote ``gives the impression that he didn't like Oak Park and that
isn't true. He had a normal, happy childhood, and he got a good
education here.
   ``His family was active in community affairs and in photographing
themselves. So we have plenty of photos,'' Schwar said.
   Although Hemingway only wrote short stories of his Chicago-area
roots, Buske thinks the author, who committed suicide while gravely
ill in 1961, actually was deeply influenced by the suburb's morality
and hard-work ethic.
   ``He didn't feel right when he wasn't following Oak Park
traditions. Let's take sexual morality. He married the girls he went

<BYLINE>Repeal of Confidentiality Measure Sent to Texas Governor ^By PEGGY
FIKAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill repealing a new law that allowed
police to withhold the names of all felony victims has been sent to
Gov. Bill Clements, who will sign it, a spokeswoman says.
   ``At the direction of the governor, our staff worked with
sponsors of the bill to make sure the problem was straightened
out,'' said Rossanna Salazar, deputy gubernatorial press secretary.
   The repeal was approved by the House with a 134-0 vote after it
was amended to protect certain crime victims from being contacted by
companies soliciting business, such as those selling home security
systems.
   The Senate concurred with the amendment, 27-0, and sent the bill
to Clements.
   News organizations decried the confidentiality law after several
law enforcement agencies began withholding information they
previously had made public.
   The law was passed during the regular session that ended May 29.
   Some agencies withheld information on missing children and
accident victims, said San Antonio Light Publisher George Irish in
testimony this week to a House committee. Irish represented Texas
Media, a first amendment and freedom-of-information coalition of
seven news organizations, in urging repeal.
   Rep. Fred Blair, who sponsored the confidentiality law and the
bill repealing it, said the original measure ``was being broadly
applied to accident victims, DWIs, missing children _ all the kinds
of things that we want to provide information on.''
   ``So we repealed it, and we're going to take a look at it in the
future,'' said Blair.
   Blair said the bill sent to the governor accomplishes ``about
half'' of what he wants in order to protect crime victims, but that
he wanted ``an ample opportunity for full discussion'' before
attempting further changes.
   The bill, in addition to the repeal, would prohibit using crime
victim information obtained from law enforcement agencies to solicit
business from the victim or a family member of the victim.
   The prohibition would apply to victims who were injured in a
crime or whose home was illegally entered.
   The bill would give the attorney general power to sue under the
Deceptive Trade Practices Act to stop such use of the information.
Violation of the law would be punishable by civil penalties up to
$10,000 plus court costs and attorney's fees.
   The repeal would be immediate, and the solicitation section would
take effect Jan. 1.

   An infant was killed with a gun her
6-year-old sister found under their parents' pillow hours after Gov.
Bob Martinez signed a bill intended to protect children from
accidental shootings.
   Ten-month-old Enercida Suarez was shot late late Wednesday and
died early today at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa, police said.
   She was the seventh victim of such an accident since June 1.
   ``The 6-year-old found the .38-caliber revolver laying on their
parents' bed under a pillow ... and thinking it was a toy, and fired
it one time, striking the girl in the head,'' said Tampa police
officer S. Middleton.
   Possible charges are pending against the girls' parents, Amancio
and Reina Suarez, and police are continuing to investigate the
shooting, Middleton said.
   But the law Martinez signed Wednesday doesn't take effect until
October 1 and won't apply in this case, he said.
   The law requires gun owners to take reasonable precautions to
keep loaded weapons in their homes and businesses out of the hands
of children age 15 and younger by using trigger locks or keeping the
weapon in a locked box.
   ``This will assist in protecting our children throughout the
state,'' Martinez said. ``The added public awareness will prompt
adults to keep guns out of reach.''
   Wednesday's signing ceremony also came one day after a 9-year-old
Clearwater boy shot himself in the finger. Tomy Zemko found the
.25-caliber pistol after climbing onto a chair to get some potato
chips from atop the refrigerator in his grandmother's home. He was
treated for a broken finger.
   Three children died and two were wounded in the earlier
shootings, inspiring lawmakers to push for the first-of-its kind
legislation during a special session last month.
   The law provides for adult gun owners to be charged with a
felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine,
if a child shoots himself or another child because of the owner's
carelessness.
   If a minor threatens someone with the gun or displays it in
public, its owner faces a misdemeanor charge and up to 60 days in
jail with a $500 fine.
   No grieving parent of an injured or fatally wounded child shot by
another member of the family could be arrested until seven days
after the shooting.
   There are exemptions for hunting and target-shooting accidents
and those involving guns taken illegally.
   The measure also will authorize the development of a gun safety
program in the state's public schools.
   The Unified Sportsmen of Florida, the state affiliate of the
National Rifle Association, helped lawmakers write legislation it
could support after a stronger version it opposed was rejected
during the Legislature's regular 60-day session, which ended June 3.
   The Florida law may inspire similar legislation in other states,
said Bernard Horn, state legislative director for Washington-based
Handgun Control Inc.
   Lawmakers from states including California, New York, Illinois,
Ohio, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland and Virginia
have contacted Horn's organization about the law, he said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Jury to Avoid Movie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge cited parallels between an
international money laundering case and the plot of ``Lethal Weapon
2'' in forbidding a jury to see the film until after the trial.
   None of the jurors in the trial of three men _ including the
Yugoslavian consul general in Chicago _ had seen the film as of
Tuesday when U.S. District Judge Jan E. DuBois issued his order.
   He told jurors to avoid seeing the film, reading reviews of it,
and talking to anyone who has seen it for the trial's duration.
   DuBois said the order was a ``small imposition'' to ensure a fair
trial, which began June 19. It is expected to last into August.
   The film, which stars Mel Gibson and opened in Philadelphia over
the weekend, is about an international money laundering scheme
involving a South African diplomat and an eccentric accountant who
has laundered money for the mob and has decided to cooperate with
prosecutors.
   The trial has a similar theme. The key prosecution witness is
Hubert F. Cole, a chemical engineer and tax protester who aspired to
be a money launderer for the mob.
   Cole was arrested Dec. 1 at Philadelphia International Airport
and in April pleaded guilty and became the prosecution's key witness.
   A spokesman for Warner Bros. said the similar plot lines of movie
and trial were coincidental. ``Lethal Weapon 2'' began filming in
November and the script was written months earlier.
   Michael C. Goode, the attorney for Bahrudin Bijedic, 48, the
Yugoslavian consul general on trial, asked DuBois for the order. He
said Bijedic was ``deeply depressed'' after seeing the film. Goode
added that he felt the movie could sway a juror against his client.
   The others on trial are Vinko Mir, 54, of New York City, chairman
of the board of LBS Bank of New York Inc.; Vjeskoslov Spanjol, 31,
of Plano, Texas, a naturalized U.S. citizen; and the bank itself.
   They are charged in a conspiracy to launder $3.5 million provided
by undercover Customs Service agents during 1987 and 1988 in a sting
operation.
   Spanjol is also charged with violating the Arms Export Control
Act by allegedly smuggling two restricted underwater breathing
devices into Europe.
   Another man, Larry Card, 50, of Chattanooga, Tenn., has pleaded
guilty to the scheme.

   Anyone can move a harp, but few can do
it with the charm and wit of Hans Verbugt and George Bruls.
   Organizers of the USA International Harp Competition realized
this when they invited the ``Dutch boys'' to move harps here during
the 10-day competition.
   ``They're just really fun to have around,'' said Elizabeth
Hainen, one of four finalists. ``They're good for everyone's
spirits.''
   The two have been known to dance all night and move harps all day
without losing their charm. They take seriously the task of
entertaining contestants who have been eliminated.
   Their responsibilities, however, are not all fun and games.
   Carrying the harp with its 47 strings and 2,000 moving pieces is
serious business. Elaborate charts are required to get the right
harp in the right place at the right moment.
   ``Contestants are very nervous normally,'' Bruls said. ``To break
a harp is one thing. If you put it down with a bump, then they start
saying, `Oh no, the tuning is gone.' Before you break it, you can
really screw up the tuning.''
   The men also shuffle two piano benches and several special harp
chairs for contestants.
   ``They want their own chairs,'' Verbugt said. ``It has to be in a
particular position, with this side facing out or that one.
Everything has to be that way, otherwise they cannot get into their
proper mood.''
   ``They take the load off our shoulders,'' said Robert G.
Campbell, president and executive director of the competition.
``We'd have to hire somebody who'd have to be trained how to handle
harps.''
   During this competition at Indiana University, Bruls and Verbugt
have moved harps from practice rooms to the stage for 37
competitors. They also have stood on their heads to evoke smiles and
held a harpist tightly when a painful finger forced her to quit the
competition.
   Verbugt, a musicologist, and Bruls, a physicist, are the last to
see a harpist before she goes onstage and the first to congratulate
or console her after the performance.
   ``Some need a shoulder to cry on. Some need someone to laugh
with,'' Bruls said. ``This stupid carrying, anyone can do it. The
atmosphere you have to create, that makes it interesting to us.''
   The men came upon their hobby by accident. Bruls' former
girlfriend in Holland was a harpist, and he was enlisted to help
move instruments at the first World Harp Congress there in 1983.
   That led to an invitation to the second congress in Israel in
1985 and the third in Vienna in 1987.
   ``It's a very nice way to see the world,'' Bruls said.
   The two say they've noticed that it also is a nice way to meet
beautiful women. Ninety-nine percent of the world's top harpists are
women.
   ``They need special attention,'' Verbugt said with a knowing
smile.
   Verbugt comes to harp competitions to research a book he is
writing on Dutch harpist Phia Berghout.
   Bruls uses them to escape the stress of physics and enjoy the
heavenly sounds.
   ``I really like the music,'' he said. ``It's the best music there
is.''
   In addition to Ms. Hainen, 22, of Toledo, Ohio, the other
finalists are Kirsten Agresta, 18, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; Maria
Casale, 26, of North Hollywood, Calif.; and Marie-Pierre Chavaroche,
19, of France.
   All four will perform solo and with orchestra Friday night in the
last stage of competition.
   The first-place winner will receive a Lyon and Healy concert harp
worth more than $17,000 and a New York debut recital March 13 at
Lincoln Center.

<HEAD>Exxon, Coast Guard Debate Source of Oily Slick</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An oily slick several miles long may be from
residue dissolving in the tanks of the Exxon Valdez as the damaged
tanker goes in circles outside San Diego Bay, Coast Guard officials
said.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Jack Scarborough said Wednesday the residue may
have dissolved as the ship entered the waters of Southern
California, where the Valdez is to undergo extensive repairs.
   The 987-foot ship was damaged in March when it crashed into a
reef in Prince William Sound off Alaska. It spilled nearly 11
million gallons of oil, the worst spill in U.S. history.
   Officials were awaiting results of samples sent to a Coast Guard
laboratory in Connecticut to determine the source of this week's
leak. Exxon officials say the material is leaking from the Valdez,
but they don't know what it is.
   The Valdez remained about 50 miles off San Diego early today. It
has been barred from entering the bay until it is free of
environmental and navigational hazards.
   Scarborough said the difference in the water temperatures may
have caused the recent leaking: ``That would explain why the folks
in Alaska felt they had a clean ship when she sailed and would
explain why we have a dirty ship now.''
   But Exxon Shipping President Frank Iarossi said he doubted that
was the case. ``I don't think temperature is a significant factor,''
Iarossi said. ``The reason is, we operate in 80-degree temperatures
all the time.''
   Alaskan waters were about 35 degrees; San Diego's are about 60
degrees.
   Scarborough said the ship was trailing an oily slick about 11
miles long Wednesday but that the discharges have become
intermittent and less concentrated.
   Two longer slicks that formed Monday and Tuesday were said to be
dissipating. Exxon agreed Wednesday to hire a cleanup vessel to
mitigate any environmental damage.
   Officials said the impact on fish and wildlife was expected to be
negligible.
   Once the leakage stops for at least a 24-hour period, the ship
will be towed to a sheltered cove, probably off Navy-owned San
Clemente Island, so divers can remove five pieces of metal hanging
from the hull to allow the ship to enter the shallow harbor.
   After the repairs, the ship is to enter the harbor to begin a $25
million overhaul at National Steel and Shipbuilding Co, where it was
built in 1986.

<HEAD>Woman Accused of Delivering Drugs to Her Unborn Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANFORD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge must decide whether a cocaine addict
whose two children were born with the drug in their bodies should be
found guilty of delivering drugs to her unborn babies.
   A prosecutor said Jennifer Johnson, 23, knew she was feeding her
daughter cocaine through the umbilical cord.
   ``She knew full well a long time ago that when she took cocaine,
it went to that baby,'' Assistant State Attorney Jeff Deen said.
   But Johnson's lawyer, Michael Sweeting, questioned whether her
addiction justified charges of drug trafficking and child abuse. He
said Johnson could not have known that she was committing such a
crime and should be acquitted.
   ``No matter how egregious my client's behavior was, you cannot
make her criminally responsible for that which was not a crime
yet,'' Sweeting said.
   Seminole Circuit Judge O.H. Eaton Jr., who is hearing the case
without a jury, presided over the first day of testimony Wednesday
and said he may issue a verdict today.
   Johnson, of Altamonte Springs, faces drug delivery charges
normally reserved for drug pushers. Her daughter born in January and
a son born in 1987 were found with traces of the illegal drug in
their bodies.
   Her mother testified that Johnson admitted to using cocaine
during the past three years and while pregnant.
   The only other woman in the state to face similar charges had her
case dropped recently on technical grounds.
   A grand jury in Rockford, Ill., refused to indict a woman for
manslaughter in May in the cocaine-linked death of her 2-day-old
daughter. In 1987, a California judge dismissed a charge of failure
to provide medical care to a child, lodged against a woman whose son
was born damaged and later died. Prosecutors had accused her of
ignoring a doctor's advice not to abuse drugs.
   The Johnson case could set a dangerous precedent, according to
the American Civil Liberties Union, which sent a representative from
New York City and a doctor who testified on Johnson's behalf.
   Dr. Stephen Kandall said it could not be proven without a doubt
that the umbilical cord carried the illegal drug from Johnson to her
babies.
   ACLU staff counselor Marjorie Smith the state could better spend
its time finding ways to treat addicted women, and warned that a
conviction could discourage cocaine users from seeking medical help
when pregnant out of fear they may wind up in jail.
   ``Word travels fast,'' she said.
   But Deen argued that by holding Johnson criminally liable, the
state could take an active role in preventing women from having
cocaine-addicted babies.
   Johnson, who now lives in an Apopka drug treatment center, did
not testify. Her mother and aunt have custody of her children, who
are healthy.

   Here is a state-by-state glance at details on fires in the West:
   _Utah: Nine fires still active that had burned 34,480 acres, with
all but a 100-acre fire near Green River contained. Largest, a
15,500-acre fire 20 miles west of the Colorado line, was contained
Wednesday. About 950 firefighters had been on the lines, but most
were being demobilized Wednesday.
   _Arizona: Firefighters were being sent to other states Wednesday
after rain helped them contain and control most of the state's
lightning-caused fires, and 360,000 acres in the Coconino and
Apache-Sitgreaves national forests in the northern and eastern
sections of the state were reopened.
   _California: Four fires still active that had burned 16,473
acres, with two of them contained. Largest fire, east of San Diego,
had burned 4,670 acres and was 80 percent contained. Officials
pushed back the target for containing a 2,900-acre fire in rough
terrain near Big Sur to Friday evening.
   _Colorado: A half-inch of rain fell in Boulder Canyon, helping
crews contain a 2,000-acre fire that destroyed 37 homes and damaged
19 other buildings, and a 2,600-acre fire in Mesa Verde National
Park was controlled without damaging ruins left by 13th century
Anasazi Indians. Four fires still active that had burned nearly
6,000 acres, with three of them contained.
   _Nebraska: Fort Robinson fire was contained Wednesday but several
hot spots remained well within the fire line. Land burned by the
5-day-old fire was estimated at 50,000 to 100,000 acres. Believed to
have burned 14 unoccupied structures.
   _Wyoming: Four fires still active, with three of them contained.
Largest fire, in Bridger-Teton National Forest, had burned 3,447
acres and was contained Monday but still burning.

   Kimberly Stroud arrived at federal court to
hear her husband plead innocent to charges of stealing three Air
Force jet engines. By the end of the hearing, she was standing next
to him as a defendant.
   Mrs. Stroud, who was unaware of the allegations against her, was
named in a 22-count grand jury indictment released Wednesday at a
detention hearing for her husband, Senior Airman Danny Joe Stroud,
and Airman 1st Class Brian David Roth, both military policemen at
Hill Air Force Base.
   Roth, 22, of Chesterland, Ohio, and Stroud, 23, of Wichita, Kan.,
were arrested Monday in the July 3 theft of three 3,200-pound F-16
fighter jet engines from the northern Utah installation. The jets
are valued at $2 million each.
   Mrs. Stroud, 22, was charged at the detention hearing, where all
three defendants pleaded innocent to the counts and were given Sept.
10 trial dates by U.S. Magistrate Ronald Boyce.
   The Strouds' attorney, Stephen Madsen, said Mrs. Stroud had been
due to be summoned to court rather than arrested.
   ``She did appear voluntarily and she was not aware of this until
she did appear,'' he said.
   The arrests and 12 other indictments against as-yet unidentified
people capped an FBI sting operation aimed at servicemen, civilians
and wholesalers in stolen goods at Hill, other Utah military
installations and elsewhere, the FBI said.
   Roth and the Strouds were charged with selling or disposing of
government property valued at more than $8.1 million, including the
three engines, a flight-line tow tractor and three engine trailers.
   Mrs. Stroud's alleged involvement was not explained.
   In Count 2, Roth and Stroud were charged with aiding and abetting
each other in stealing and selling $64,000 worth of Zenith computers.
   Roth alone was named in Counts 3 through 22, which charged theft
of such items as a combat helmet, chemical protective clothing,
military supplies, aviation instruments, radios and bullet-proof
vests.
   Boyce ordered Roth held in the Salt Lake County jail after FBI
agent Donald Roberts testified that Roth told undercover agents that
if he was caught, he would ``run and not be found.''
   The magistrate ordered Stroud confined to barracks pending an
agreement between prosecutors and his commander and also granted
Stroud supervised visits with his 5-month-old daughter and wife, who
was released.

   A tiny video camera and cable used in a federal
investigation of political corruption were uncovered by a busboy at
a restaurant across from City Hall, an attorney for the restaurant's
owners says.
   ``The FBI planted the listening devices, and they were discovered
by one of our busboys,'' attorney Nicholas M. Spina was quoted as
saying in today's editions of the Chicago Tribune.
   George Borovilos, co-owner of the restaurant, said he waited
several days to call the FBI about the equipment because ``we didn't
know who it belonged to.''
   Borovilos said that after he talked to the FBI Tuesday, agents
removed the camera from the restaurant. They left behind the
connecting wire that ran under a seat cushion, through a concrete
wall and down into the basement of the building, he told the Tribune.
   Spina said the sophisticated wide-angle camera, with a lens the
size of a little finger, was found Friday hidden in the base of a
booth at Counselors Row Restaurant, a popular spot for lawmakers,
lawyers, government workers and other City Hall employees.
   He said the camera was pointed at a table often used by Alderman
Fred Roti, Democratic ward Committeeman John D'Arco and influential
businessman Pat Marcy.
   The paper quoted unidentified sources as saying the FBI also
tapped a telephone on a pedestal next to the table.
   Spina said the restaurant's owners were ``shocked, outraged and
extremely upset that this type of conduct exists in the United
States.''
   Gary Shapiro, the federal prosecutor in charge of organized crime
investigations in Chicago, said he had authorized planting the
device, Spina said.
   Spina said a judge approved the installation of the surveillance
equipment and it was placed in the restaurant without the owners'
consent, apparently on a weekend when the place was closed.
   Alderman Richard Mell, who also frequents the table or ones
nearby, said, ``I have no problem with (the bugs). Is it true?. It
looks like a very interesting story.''
   Roti said in a statement, ``There is no reason for me to be
investigated, and no reason to believe that I am being
investigated.''
   The NBC network affiliate WMAQ-TV reported that the strike force
has been investigating possible corruption in the 1st Ward,
including gambling in its Chinatown section.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas declined to comment, as did Shapiro,
director of the U.S. Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike
Force, the television station said.
   Dan Gillogly, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office, told The
Associated Press early today he didn't know anything about the story.
   D'Arco and Marcy didn't return telephone messages, WMAQ and the
Chicago Tribune said.

   An aide to Finance Minister Shimon Peres said
today that Israel was conducting ``clear, official and unequivocal''
negotiations with the PLO via intermediaries from the United States
and other countries.
   ``Whoever doesn't admit or recognize this, whoever tries to
ignore it is like a small boy who closes his eyes and thinks the
world doesn't see him,'' said the aide, Deputy Finance Minister
Yossi Beilin.
   He spoke on army radio after testimony by U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State John H. Kelly raised a storm in Israel, which has
officially boycotted the PLO, calling it a terrorist group bent on
Israel's destruction.
   Kelly, replying to a question during a congressional hearing in
Washington on Wednesday, said it would be an ``exaggeration'' to say
an official dialogue is taking place between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   But he said there was ``classified reporting about contacts''
between the two that he would discuss only in a closed-door session.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Peres, chairman of the
left-leaning Labor Party that is a partner in the governing
coalition, deny any Israeli talks have taken place with the PLO.
   ``It's an absolute lie. We are not speaking either directly or
indirectly with that group,'' Shamir's spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said,
reiterating the premier's remarks in a telephone interview today.
   But Beilin claimed the denials were only technical.
   ``For 2{ months, clear, official, unequivocal negotiations have
been under way between the Israeli government headed by Yitzhak
Shamir, via the Americans,'' Beilin said.
   Other foreign diplomats, including Egypt's minister of foreign
affairs, Butros Ghali, were also involved in these contacts, he
added.
   Beilin said the entire process was indirect and that Israel, in
keeping with its policies, had not sent any official messages to PLO
leaders.
   ``We speak to the Americans, raise proposals, the Americans go to
the PLO in Tunis,'' Beilin said. ``They come back to us. If they
tell us they talked to the PLO we shut the door, if they say they
spoke to Palestinians, we open it and listen to what they have to
say.''
   Beilin also urged the government to ``recognize and take
advantage of it (the contacts) before it will be too late.''
   He said the government should deal with PLO Chief Yasser Arafat
or would have to face more radical Palestinian leaders.
   Israel has held indirect contacts with the PLO in the past, most
notably in 1981 when former U.S. Middle East envoy Philip C. Habib
and U.N. official William Callahan helped negotiate a cease-fire
agreement between the two along the Lebanese border.
   The pact fell apart a year later when Israel invaded Lebanon to
rout guerrilla strongholds in response to attacks on Israelis in
Europe by Palestinian extremists.
   The Labor Party, meanwhile, toned down its threats to leave the
governing coalition after appeals from the Bush administration to
give Shamir's peace plan another chance.
   Labor charges that the plan has been damaged by new hard-line
conditions imposed by Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc July 5 that
decrease chances for Palestinian acceptance.
   But after Labor ministers met Wednesday night, Peres said: ``We
have no aspiration to break up the government. The Labor Party aims
to work for the advancement of the peace plan.''
   The easing of Labor's threat appeared aimed at giving Shamir time
to renew his commitment to the peace initiative.
   The plan calls for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip to elect representatives for negotiations on limited
self-rule.
   Likud's new conditions demand that the 19-month Palestinian
uprising end before a vote occurs and specify that the Arabs in
Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem cannot cast ballots, a key
Palestinian demand.
   Meanwhile, Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian in the
Gaza Strip when a gang of masked youths attacked a patrol with
knives and axes, the army said today.
   The victim was identified as Riad Hashem Ali El-Shakra, 18. Arab
reports said he was shot in the chest at the Khan Yunis refugee
camp, and the army said he died after he was evacuated to Soroka
Hospital in southern Israel.
   The death raised to at least 560 the number of Palestinians
killed since Arabs launched their uprising in the West Bank and Gaza
against Israel's 22-year occupation. Thirty-five Israelis also have
been slain.
   Five other Palestinians were shot and wounded today as protests
broke out during the Moslem holiday of Eid Al-Adha, or Feast of
Sacrifice, the climax of the annual pilgrimage to Islam's holiest
shrine in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
   Four of the wounded were in the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza.

   Portrait artist Ralph Cowan quickly
put his talents to work after someone snatched a gold chain from his
neck in a restaurant parking lot.
   This week, Cowan added a painting of a common thief to his
credits of nearly 2,000 portraits, including members of four royal
families.
   ``Do you know how many people who have been robbed wished they
could have been able to do this?'' asked Cowan. ``I remember saying
many years ago if anybody robs me, they better hide because I'll
have a life-sized painting of them out immediately.''
   Cowan, 57, of Palm Beach County, was leaving a fast-food
restaurant Monday night when someone walked up to him and told him,
``Pops, how about 50 cents,'' according to police. Cowan ignored the
man and kept walking.
   ``He got in his car and the guy reached in and grabbed his neck
and pulled off the chain,'' Mark Deren, Cowan's studio director,
said Wednesday.
   The chain and scarab were worth $1,000, police said.
   Police who searched the area didn't turn up anything.
   Cowan then went home and drew a sketch, and the following morning
completed his portrait, Deren said.
   Within 12 hours of the snatching, Cowan handed the West Palm
Beach Police Department a signed and framed 24-by-30-inch oil
painting of the suspect.
   Deren said the painting shows the suspect with his hand up,
holding the chain. Next to the portrait is a description of the man,
who police said remained at large Wednesday.
   ``People have come in before with sketches,'' said Detective Jack
Yates. But ``this is the first time anyone has ever brought a
portrait with such clarity.''
   Cowan usually charges $25,000 or more for his portraits. In 1969,
he painted an Elvis Presley portrait that hangs at his Graceland
estate in Memphis, Tenn.
   He did a portrait of former President and Mrs. Reagan as a state
gift from the Philippines' Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos in 1984, two
years before they fled to Hawaii.
   Cowan also has painted portraits of Monaco's royal family, King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II in Morocco, and of the Sultan
of Brunei and his family.

   President Bush joined President Francois Mitterrand
and more than 30 other world leaders today to commemorate the French
Revolution's ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity.
   The 15-minute noontime ceremony at the Place du Trocadero
launched a busy weekend of bicentennial parties and international
diplomacy, grouped around the annual summit of the seven biggest
industrial democracies.
   Actors read portions of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and
the Citizen, proclaimed in October 1789 before the French Revolution
turned to terror and tyranny. Interspersed were choral segments and
quotations from revolutionary leaders.
   At the end, children dressed in white ran to a stone inscribed
with the declaration and ringed it with wreaths and flowers. Five
hundred doves were released to fly freely into the almost cloudless
sky.
   The presidents and prime ministers, with several hundred invited
guests, sat in warm sunshine overlooking the Trocadero esplanade and
_ across the Seine River _ the Eiffel Tower.
   The leaders arrived in a steady stream of limousines and were
greeted by Mitterrand. A cheer went up from a crowd on the street
when Philippines President Corazon Aquino arrived.
   Among the other guests were Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India,
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Mobutu Sese Seko of
Zaire and other African leaders, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, Brazilian President Jose Sarney, President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Uruguayan President Julio Maria
Sanguinetti.
   Barbara Bush sat to the left of Danielle Mitterrand in the front
row of a section of temporary stands set aside for the leaders'
spouses.
   The capital was prepared for another Bastille mob scene later in
the day, but unlike the storming 200 years ago that began the French
Revolution, this crowd was gathering for celebration.
   The inaugural concert of the Opera Bastille was expected to
attract a range of dignitaries, including 30 heads of state, and the
cream of French society.
   Operagoers descending the dramatic gray stone staircase leading
to the modern glass-and-steel opera house late tonight were to face
a cultural event of an altogether different sort.
   Thousands of Parisians and tourists will be dancing in the
streets at a bicentennial bash billed as the ``World's Biggest
Ball.''
   The street dance, one of 36,000 outdoor parties taking place in
France during the three-day nationwide celebration, will take
bicentennial bingers into the wee hours of Friday morning.
   A traditional military parade marches down the Champs Elysee
early Friday, accompanied by tanks, fighters and helicopters roaring
overhead.
   In the evening, impresario Jean-Paul Goude's bizarre
opera-ballet-parade called ``La Marseilleise'' will strut and
struggle down the famous avenue in a salute to the international
spirit of 1789.
   Britons will parade in an artificial rain, Russians will dance
with a bear on ice and an American marching band will boogie
backward all the way.
   The parade will be broadcast to millions of viewers worldwide.
   Paris festivities will conclude with a bang, as a spectacular
display of fireworks illuminates the City of Lights on Saturday.

   Homicide detectives believe a 22-year-old woman
is the latest victim in a series of 41 killings dating back to 1985.
   Sheriff's deputies found Nicolette Jean Frye's body Monday in a
ravine in East San Diego County. The investigation of her death has
been taken over by a task force looking into the deaths of the other
women in similar circumstances.
   Frye had been dead three or four days when her body was found
lying at the bottom of a steep embankment near La Mesa, which is
north of San Diego.
   Her body was fully clothed, unlike most of the other victims, who
were left naked or partially clad.
   Court records show that Frye had a history of prostitution and
drug use as did most of the other victims.
   An autopsy on Frye's body was inconclusive. The cause of death
will not be known until further tests have been conducted.
   Metropolitan Homicide Task Force spokesman Jim Cooke said there
are no suspects.
   Frye's boyfriend, Fernando Astorga, and others said she was
trying to put her life back together.
   But Astorga said Frye's problems with drugs were not over and
that she probably was working as a prostitute on the streets shortly
before she died.
   Many of the deaths are similar to an unsolved string of 48
killings in the Seattle area from 1982 through 1984.

   Cable television mogul Ted Turner called
anti-abortion activists ``Bozos,'' and proclaimed that if anyone
doesn't like his station's soon-to-be-broadcast abortion program
with a pro-choice angle, then tough.
   ``You bet your bippy we're taking a position,'' Turner said
Wednesday of the program ``Abortion for Survival,'' scheduled for a
July 20 broadcast on his TBS SuperStation.
   Turner told a gathering of television critics and writers at the
National Cable Forum that he didn't even try to find sponsors for
the half-hour show.
   ``We'll just take a lick for a night. You know, so it'll cost us
four or five hundred thousand dollars,'' he said.
   Turner, his language weaving in and out of what's allowed in a
family newspaper, criticized anti-abortion activists, saying they
try to impose their views on others.
   ``I don't want anybody else telling me what my daughter's got to
have, or my wife, or my girlfriend,'' said Turner. ``We live in a
free country. There is absolutely no way that that's anybody's
business but the person that's involved. That's my opinion.''
   Despite his convictions, Turner will broadcast a panel discussion
after ``Abortion for Survival,'' with people on both sides of the
issue. Just don't expect him to listen.
   ``We'll give the other Bozos a chance to talk back,'' Turner
said. ``They look like idiots anyway.''
   And that's not all, he said.
   ``The pro-lifers say we don't want people to have sex for fun,
only to have babies. It's sinful. Sex is sinful,'' Turner said.
``Well, that's fine if those people don't want to ever have sex.
Swell. I happen to enjoy it. I don't get near as much as I want to.''

   A woman wearing a wig and dark glasses shot and
killed a college maintenance chief in the school courtyard, then
fled into a nearby subway station and escaped in the morning
rush-hour crowds, police said.
   George Roscoe, 43, was shot three times in the back Wednesday. He
died a short time later at New York Hospital.
   The woman, wearing a red jogging suit, had been seen lurking that
morning at Hunter College, on Manhattan's East Side, for Roscoe to
show up for work, authorities said.
   The killer, described as in her 20s, yelled, ``You lying
mother,'' before shooting Roscoe with a small-caliber handgun, a
security guard told police, according to the New York Post in
today's editions.
   Before disappearing into the subway station, the woman shed the
black wig and sunglasses, which were retrieved, said police
spokesman Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell. The gun was not recovered.
   About 50,000 subway commuters were delayed for more than 30
minutes after police stopped a train to search for the suspect, said
Transit Authority spokesman Termaine Garden.
   The New York Post and New York Newsday both reported that Roscoe
had recently moved out of his girlfriend's apartment. The woman was
questioned but released without charges, police sources said.
   Roscoe, the divorced father of two children, was acting director
of housekeeping services, said Hunter spokeswoman Patricia Falk.

   Bush's wife, Barbara, said today the raincoat belonged to a
Secret Service agent who was accompanying the president to an
arrival ceremony in a downtown square Tuesday.
   After making an abbreviated speech, Bush spotted the woman in the
crowd, drenched to the bone after a heavy downpour. He took off his
raincoat and gave it to her _ a seemingly selfless gesture that
attracted a lot of publicity.
   Promising to replace the agent's coat, Mrs. Bush said she and the
president know the exact brand they have to get.
   ``We're going to buy one right away,'' she promised. ``We know
where to get them _ in Kennebunkport'' Maine where they have a
vacation home and where discount outlet stores abound.

<TEXT>
   A man who was accused of spreading rumors after he
spoke to an American television crew about the military assault on
Tiananmen Square was sentenced to 10 years in prison today.
   The television news said Xiao Bin, 42, also was deprived of all
political rights for three years in a decision by a court in Dalian,
northeast China.
   Xiao, vice section chief in a rubber factory, was charged with
spreading counterrevolutionary rumors after telling an ABC
television crew that 20,000 people were killed when the army fired
on pro-democracy protesters and their supporters June 3-4.
   During the interview with ABC, Xiao said Tiananmen Square was
covered with blood and that tanks had run over people.
   China denied anyone was killed in Tiananmen Square. It says about
200 civilians died when soldiers were forced to fire on rioters who
blocked their way as they entered Tiananmen Square. Chinese sources
and Western diplomats have put the figure as high as 3,000 and say
troops fired randomly into crowds.
   China Central Television apparently intercepted the unedited
video as ABC sent it by satellite to its New York headquarters.
   China's state-run television broadcast the interview and urged
viewers to help find the man. Two women reported him within hours,
and he was arrested June 11.
   ABC said it was ``deeply distressed'' over the use of its tape,
and it began covering the faces of students it interviewed.
   Foreign travel agents today urged China to end martial law in
Beijing, lower tour prices and mount a public relations campaign
abroad if it wants to bring back tourists scared by the crackdown.
   During a daylong meeting, many agents said China should invest in
overseas tour promotions, something it does not normally do.
   ``They want people to come in _ they have to go outside,'' said
Peter Spreadborough of Silk Route Travel in Melbourne, Australia.
``Our problem is destination credibility. We know it's safe, but
until there is some sizeable effort from big guns in Chinese
tourism, we're fighting an uphill battle.''
   Ken Chang of Pacific Delight Tours in Hong Kong said his company
lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on promotional material for
now-canceled China tours.
   Since the military crackdown, tourism in China has nearly halted.
When 16 foreigners arrived in the eastern province of Jiangxi today,
local officials gave them a ceremony and welcomed them as the first
foreign visitors in two months, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Earlier today, the Foreign Ministry denied China has suffered a
diplomatic loss of face and said most nations support its tough
measures to eliminate political dissent.
   ``The fact is that there are only a few countries who are
interfering in China's internal affairs,'' ministry spokeswoman Li
Jinhua said at a weekly briefing. ``The majority of countries have
expressed their understanding, sympathy and even support for us.''
   Most Western governments have suspended high-level official
contacts and taken other measures to protest the violence and mass
arrests of protesters. Some socialist and non-aligned countries,
such as Hungary and Yugoslavia, have joined in criticizing China.
   Li criticized France for sheltering two fugitives, student
activist Wu'er Kaixi and political theorist Yan Jiaqi, who are
wanted by Chinese police for instigating and organizing protests.
   ``The fact that France allowed them to go to France and to openly
carry out activities there aimed at subverting the government of the
People's Republic of China is a flagrant violation of international
law, and the norms governing international relations, and it is also
a gross interference in China's internal affairs and a serious
violation of China's sovereignty,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A suspended Roman Catholic priest is rejecting
a call by the church's U.S. black bishops that he abandon his
unsanctioned African-American Catholic congregation.
   ``The people have spoken,'' the Rev. George A. Stallings Jr.,
said Wednesday, citing the number of people who attended the first
two weeks of services at his Imani Temple.
   Stallings told The Washington Post the bishops' statement was
``predictable'' and said they ``opted for office and position over
their ability to exercise a prophetic voice'' in the leadership of
the 53-million-member American church's nearly 2 million black
members.
   The priest said he has no intention of abandoning his church,
adding instead that he plans to expand it. He has contended that the
Catholic church fails to address the needs of its black parishioners.
   The bishops, in a statement, said Stallings ``possesses the
vibrancy of our culture and spiritual heritage'' but should make
those changes within the church.
   ``We implore him to return to the unity of the church,'' the
bishops said, ``and to continue to urge reform ... within the unity
of the one Catholic church.''
   Cardinal James A. Hickey, archbishop of Washington, said in a
column published in the Post today that the controversy over
Stallings' church ``is not a dispute between those who oppose racism
and those who support it.''
   The dispute ``has more to do with the problems and expectations
of one individual than broader questions about the adequacy of the
church's ministry in the black community,'' Hickey said. ``To Father
Stallings, I say come home.''
   In a statement distributed by the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops, the 13 bishops said racism exists in the church but that
the problem must be solved by dialogue between the black community
and the church leaders.
   Baltimore's auxiliary Bishop John Ricard said in an interview,
``It is the absolute intent of the black bishops to seek some type
of reconciliation with Father Stallings. In no way do we want to cut
off dialogue.''
   The bishops said they had a ``dual love and devotion'' to the
faith of the church and to their black cultural heritage, but unlike
Stallings, they did not feel the two were in conflict.
   Stallings' suspension means he may not celebrate mass or
administer any Roman Catholic sacraments.
   An estimated 1,000 people have signed up for the Imani Temple,
and Stallings has received more than $39,000 in church offerings in
just two weeks.
   Stallings has said he wants to see establishment of an
African-American rite within the Catholic church. Earlier this week,
he said he would present a reconciliation plan to the archdiocese of
Washington, but only on his terms.
   Signing the statement were Ricard and Archbishop Eugene Marino of
Atlanta, Bishop Joseph Howze of Biloxi, Miss.; and auxiliary bishops
Harold Perry of New Orleans, Joseph Francis of Newark, James Lyke of
Cleveland, Emerson Moore of New York, Moses Anderson of Detroit,
Wilton Gregory of Chicago, J. Terry Steib of St. Louis, Carl Fisher
of Los Angeles, Curtis Guillory of Galveston-Houston, and Leonard
Olivier of Washington.

   Somewhere in this Central European
capital there is a tiny elderly woman who will forever treasure
President Bush's visit.
   She bears his raincoat as a souvenir, given to her by the
president after he spoke Tuesday in a driving rainstorm in Kossuth
Square. (The raincoat, it turned out, belonged to a Secret Service
agent accompanying Bush.)
   But among the vast populace of Hungary and Poland, there was
little evidence that the people have fallen victim to Georgiemania
to rival the emotion Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev stirred
in his own recent travels to Western Europe.
   Still, Bush was a hit, especially in Gdansk, the Baltic seaport
city that gave birth to the Polish trade union movement Solidarity.
Roughly 25,000 people swarmed around the monument to slain workers
to cheer Bush with chants of ``Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush!'' They sang
the Solidarity anthem and flashed the Solidarity ``V'' for victory
salute beneath the 80-foot-high monument at the shipyard gates.
   Shouts of ``Stay with us, stay with us!'' rang out after Bush
said that if he were a young man he would want to stay to
participate in Poland's transformation to a free-market economy. But
the prediction of Steve Studdert, a White House advance man, that
tens of thousands would turn out for Bush in Warsaw did not
materialize.
   Nor was there an immense turnout in Hungary even though Bush was
the first American president to visit the country _ and he brought
promises of U.S. aid to Budapest, as he had to Warsaw.
   Gorbachev, by contrast, made a tremendous political impact on
both West Germany and France, though the turnout in Paris, at least,
was widely considered to be a disappointment.
   The reason may be the Soviet leader represented a historic change
in Moscow's approach to the East-West problem.
   Bush, on the other hand, also promoted a relaxation of tensions,
but he is a relatively colorless American leader who does not
approach Gorbachev's charisma.
   Besides, for policy reasons, Bush forswore any intended rivalry
with Gorbachev.
   ``We're not trying to make things more difficult for him,'' the
president said before setting out for Europe. ``Just as when he goes
to France and Germany I don't think he's trying to make things more
difficult for the United States.''
   Gorbachev was welcomed last month in Bonn by large crowds
shouting ``Gorby, Gorby'' everywhere he went. He constantly outranks
all Western leaders in popularity polls in West Germany.
   During a ceremony at the official residence of West German
President Richard von Weizsaecker, the Soviet leader kissed a high
school girl. The next day, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper ran
the picture on the front page with a banner headline: ``A kiss for
Annette, a kiss for Germany.''
   In Paris, though, Gorbachev's public appearance stirred less of a
public response.
   ``French crowds simply tend to be less demonstrative than German
ones,'' said Dominique Moisi of the French Institute of
International Relations.
   But Gorbachev's political impact was unquestioned.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, in a rare gesture, invited
Gorbachev and his wife to dinner at their apartment in the Latin
Quarter.
   This may have been the first time a Soviet leader was invited to
dine at the home of a Western leader, and it signaled how important
Gorbachev's visit was taken by the French. And yet, Gorbachev was
supposed to work the crowd at the Place de la Bastille, but shook
only a few hands and did not stay long.
   On the other hand, in Kossuth Square, about 2,000 drenched
Hungarians withstood a driving rain to see Bush on Tuesday.
   The president appeared to be touched by their tribute. He tore up
his speech and said he wanted to ``just speak from the heart.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, clearly not an impartial
observer, was asked to compare Bush's travels with Gorbachev's at a
news conference Wednesday.
   He said he thought the president's crowds were ``pretty good _
pretty terrific, as a matter of fact, in Poland, and particularly in
Gdansk.''
   But Baker urged reporters to keep in mind the president's
objective _ active engagement with Poland and Hungary as they pursue
fundamental reform efforts.
   ``And that's why we're here,'' Baker said, ``not out of any idea
that we need to compete with General Secretary Gorbachev.''

   A propane gas explosion at a refinery in the oil
fields east of Moscow killed four workers, injured six and shattered
windows a half-mile away, Tass reported today.
   The official Soviet news agency said the explosion occurred early
Wednesday at a distillation plant within the Minnibayevsky Gas
Refinery in Almetyevsk, an oil center 500 miles east of the capital.
   A government inquiry determined the explosion was caused by a
propane gas leak, Tass said. All local gas pipelines were shut off
after the accident, and a fire that followed the explosion was
extinguished, it said.
   Last month, a gas pipeline leaked and exploded as two passenger
trains were passing in the Ural Mountains. More than 600 people were
killed.

<HEAD>Panel Recommends No New Effort To Find Cold Fusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Energy Department advisory panel says it
found no convincing evidence that the phenomena attributed to ``cold
fusion'' in University of Utah experiments would produce useful
sources of energy.
   The panel recommended Wednesday that no new government effort be
made to verify the experiments that startled the international
scientific community last March.
   ``Evidence for the discovery of a new nuclear process termed cold
fusion is not persuasive,'' the panel's draft report said. ``Hence,
no special programs to establish cold fusion research centers or to
support new efforts to find cold fusion are justified at the present
time.''
   The report by 22 non-government scientists will go to the Energy
Research Advisory Board, which is due to make an official
recommendation to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins by July 31.
   The advisory panel said in its report, based on eight weeks of
study, that while no new efforts to find cold fusion were justified,
there remain ``scientifically interesting questions'' about the Utah
experiments that ``should be handled by carefully focused and
cooperative efforts within current programs.''
   Cold fusion is the claim of University of Utah scientists that
the decomposition of water at room temperature into hydrogen and
oxygen by an electric current passing through a palladium electrode
leads to the absorption of hydrogen atoms in the electrode, which
then fuse to produce helium and large amounts of heat.
   If such a process could work on a large scale, it would make
possible limitless supplies of cheap energy. Some laboratories have
duplicated parts of the Utah experiment, but most that have tried
have been unable to do so.

<HEAD>City Council Bans Wood Shake Shingles For New Construction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council voted to ban roofs made of
wood shingles to protect buildings from fire, despite objections
from industry officials who said the shingles are safe.
   The proposal, approved 11-1 Wednesday, would apply to new
buildings and to roofs requiring repairs to 10 percent or more of
their surfaces. The measure goes to Mayor Tom Bradley, who has taken
no position.
   If the proposed ordinance is signed into law and survives a
possible legal challenge, Los Angeles would become the first major
American city to ban wood shake shingles.
   The measure was strongly opposed by the cedar-shingle industry,
which counts on the Los Angeles area for three-quarters of its $50
million in annual sales of shingles treated with fire-retardant
chemicals.
   At stake are hundreds of jobs and millions of investment dollars
in the Pacific Northwest and Canada, where most of the lumber for
the shingles is harvested and processed.
   The industry contends that the treated shingles are as safe as
those made of asphalt or Fiberglas.
   But city fire officials said the treated shingles lose their
effectiveness with time. ``There is not one shred of doubt in my
mind,'' City Fire Marshall Craig Drummond told the council.
   If Bradley approves the ban, the industry will take the matter to
court, said Michael M. Westfall, president of the Cedar Shake and
Shingle Bureau.

<HEAD>Eight-year-old Swims the Golden Gate Waters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An 8-year-old girl has become the youngest
person on record to swim the rough, icy waters of the Golden Gate,
the mile-wide passage where the Pacific Ocean meets San Francisco
Bay.
   ``It was scary and the waves were high and I wanted to give up
100 yards from the finish,'' Emma Macchiarini-Mankin said Wednesday
at a news conference after the 68-minute swim.
   Hypothermia and the tortuous, 60-degree current were the biggest
risks for the 5-foot, 75-pound, freckle-faced swimmer, who avoided
an outgoing Navy ship during the swim from Fort Point to the
seaweed-covered rocks at Lime Point. The distance is one mile and 52
feet.
   Emma was accompanied on the swim by her distance coach and
father, Danny Macchiarini. Macchiarini, who made his 12th crossing
of the strait, introduced Emma to pool swimming at 10 months and
dunked her in the bay when she was 5.
   Asked why she wanted to swim from San Francisco to Marin County,
she said, ``Because I don't know how to drive a car there.'' She
then added, ``I want to be famous and have all the money.''
   She alternated strokes _ seven minutes freestyle, seven
breaststroke and seven on her back, spouting seawater. Her father,
who has coached her in thrice-weekly swims, said her speed improved
dramatically in the past week.
   The fourth-grader, who wore a green, red and purple suit with a
pink bow in the back, held both arms up like a winning boxer as she
emerged from the water.
   Before Emma, the youngest swimmer was Mike Lynch, who was 12 in
1964 when he made it in 54 minutes and 30 seconds.
   Emma said she feared sharks during the swim, although her father
insisted there were none in the bay.
   ``I made a deal with the sharks,'' she said. ``I wouldn't eat
them if they wouldn't eat me.''

<HEAD>Jury Recommends Death For Man Convicted In Oakland Mass Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted of a shooting rampage that
killed a former girlfriend, three of her relatives and two others
should receive the death penalty, a jury recommended.
   Sentencing was set for July 26 for David ``Moochie'' Welch, 31,
after the jury issued its recommendation Wednesday.
   The same jury on June 19 convicted Welch of six counts of murder
stemming from the Dec. 6, 1986, rampage, described as Oakland's
worst mass killing.
   Welch and his girlfriend burst into the home of Dellane Mabrey,
17, his former girlfriend, and went from room to room shooting
occupants, some of whom were asleep. Welch had a long-running feud
with the woman's family.
   Ms. Mabrey died, along with two of her brothers, Sean, 21, and
Darnell, 20; her 2-year-old daughter, Valencia Morgan, 2; and two
houseguests, Kathy Walker, 34, and her 4-year-old son, Dwayne
Miller. Two other people, including Ms. Mabrey's 3-month-old son,
were wounded.
   Welch, 31, showed no emotion as the verdict was read. However,
after the jury had been dismissed, he said he was ``relieved for the
victims' families and for mine that this ordeal has finally come to
rest.''
   Throughout the proceedings, Welch had been combative with his
attorneys and the judge.
   Prosecutor James Anderson told the jury before sentencing that
Welch was a ``miserable, miserable, violent thug,'' and said he was
elated about the jury's verdict.
   ``The jury saw the gravity of his offenses, his lifestyle and his
violent conduct in prison and did what it had to do,'' Anderson
said. The prosecutor had produced evidence that Welch assaulted
guards and his wife while he was an inmate at San Quentin on
previous convictions.
   Spencer Strellis, one of Welch's two attorneys, said defense
witnesses included a psychologist and a psychiatrist who testified
that Welch had a history of mental illness.
   ``In our case, we asked, `Do you execute a sick man?''' Strellis
said. ``The jury answered, `yes.'''
   Rita Lewis, Welch's girlfriend who participated in the attack,
pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder and was
sentenced in December 1987 to 51 years to life in prison.

<TEXT>
   A military court today acquitted 23
soldiers of massacring 17 civilians. Another tribunal dismissed
charges against a prominent officer accused of taking part in a
bloody coup attempt in 1987.
   A six-member court-martial ruled unanimously that there was
insufficient evidence to convict the 23 members of the army's 14th
battalion of killing the civilians in the town of Lupao on Feb. 10,
1987.
   ``I am very happy because that means I can go back to the
field,'' said Sgt. Nestor Garcia, one of the defendants. A survivor,
Ricardo Carnate, had testified he saw Garcia stab his father to
death during the slayings.
   In a separate case, another court dismissed charges against air
force Lt. Col. Eduardo ``Red'' Kapunan. He had been accused of
organizing cadets at the Philippine Military Academy to join the
Aug. 28, 1987 attempt to overthrow President Corazon Aquino in which
53 people were killed and hundreds wounded.
   Kapunan was an associate of the coup leader, former Lt. Col.
Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, and a prominent member of a clique of
officers loyal to Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the former defense
minister. Kapunan was placed under house arrest in September.
Honasan remains at large.
   In the Lupao case, human rights groups and the military
prosecutors expressed surprise over the verdict because witnesses
had identified that several of the accused as having taken part in
the killings.
   Three of the defendants also were acquitted of charges they stole
$500 from the survivors in the village, 85 miles north of Manila.
   Survivors told officials that troops dragged villagers from their
homes and shot them with semi-automatic weapons after their
lieutenant was shot and killed by communist New People's Army
guerrillas.
   Mrs. Aquino visited the village soon after the slayings and
promised justice to the villagers. Human rights organizations cited
the Lupao killings as an example of civil liberties abuses under the
Aquino administration.
   Filipino and international groups also had criticized the
military because no one had been punished in the incident.

   Iranians beating their heads and chests in
grief flocked to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's gold-domed tomb today
to mark the end of 40 days of mourning for the founder of the
Islamic Republic.
   The official media, including Tehran Radio and the Islamic
Republic News Agency, said millions of people braved scorching heat
and turned out for the ceremony at the Baheshte Zahra cemetery.
   IRNA said 20,000 people ``suffered heart problems,'' were
injured, or simply collapsed as temperatures soared to 104. Some
were reported in serious condition even after treatment at makeshift
medical facilities set up along roads leading to the cemetery, said
the agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   The crowds began gathering at the cemetery at 5 a.m., more than
13 hours before a religious ceremony at the grave.
   Broadcasting live from the graveyard 10 miles south of the
capital, Tehran Television showed mourners being carried over the
crowds, apparently after fainting. Firefighters sprayed the crowd
with water.
   Mourners beat their heads and chests in a traditional Shiite
Moslem expression of grief, stopping occasionally to wipe sweat away
with handkerchiefs or the sleeves of their shirts.
   Loudspeakers along the roads and at the cemetery blared recitings
from the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   Relief facilities included a central clinic with 1,000
physicians, nurses and relief workers on duty round the clock. Fifty
makeshift medical centers and four rest houses also were set up to
offer services to motorists and pedestrians, IRNA said.
   It said dozens of stands offering food and refreshments dotted
highways and streets connecting Tehran with other cities and
provinces.
   The government provided about 600 vehicles to ferry mourners to
the cemetery, but many ended up walking as human waves blocked the
streets.
   Khomeini died June 3 at age 86.
   At least eight people were killed and thousands collapsed from
exhaustion in the mayhem of his funeral June 6 when millions packed
Tehran's streets.
   A government insurance program covered all those who gathered at
the tomb today, the end of the period of mourning in the Shiite
Moslem faith.
   Iran's state-run insurance companies announced that $13,500 will
be paid to the family of anyone who dies or is seriously injured
during the ceremony today. Medical expenses of up to $2,000 will
also be paid.
   Khomeini, who toppled 2,500 years of monarchy, was buried in a
dusty plot alongside thousands of followers killed in the 1979
revolution and thousands who died later in the war with Iraq.
   The grave has become a shrine, with hundreds of thousands of
Iranians gathering around it each day.

   Seven U.S. Army soldiers were wounded early
today when an ``explosive device'' was thrown at them as they were
walking through a village in northern Honduras, the Pentagon said.
   The condition of the soldiers was not immediately available, but
they are being treated in a local hospital, said a Defense
Department spokeswoman, Army Maj. Kathy Wood.
   She said said nine soldiers were involved in the incident, but
only seven were injured. She said the military personnel apparently
were off duty and were walking through the village at the time of
the attack.
   ``They were just walking down the street in La Cieba,'' the
spokeswoman said. ``Some sort of explosive device was thrown at
them.''
   She said she had no specific information about the identities of
the personnel, their specific units, rank or sex.
   ``The facts are very sketchy,'' she said.
   The soldiers are based at Sotocano Air Base, near Comayanga in
central Honduras, where the United States has temporary facilities.
   U.S. personnel are currently involved in a road-building exercise
near La Cieba, a northern coastal town, Maj. Wood said, but she was
not certain whether the wounded soldiers were assigned to that task.
   The spokeswoman said various reports have come in about the
incident, and that one said the explosion occurred at 2:30 a.m. EDT.

   An Armenian motorist was shot to death in a
disputed enclave of Azerbaijan, and a government official said he
was probably a victim of the ethnic unrest that has plagued the
region since early last year.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman, Alexander Timokhin, said the
Armenian's body was found Wednesday on the road to Stepanakert, the
main city in the enclave, Nagorno-Karabakh. The body of Artur
Toniyan was left by his car near two villages populated by
Azerbaijanis, Timokhin said in a telephone interview.
   The official said the attack was probably ethnically motivated.
   Tensions between Armenians, who are in a majority in
Nagorno-Karabakh, and Azerbaijanis have run high since February 1988
because of a territorial dispute over the tiny, fertile region 1,200
miles south of Moscow.
   Armenians, who are predominantly Christian, claim they are
persecuted by Azerbaijanis, who are mostly Moslem, and want
Nagorno-Karabakh to be placed under the control of the nearby
republic of Armenia.
   Two Azerbaijanis were killed and a third was seriously wounded on
Tuesday near the village of Kirkidzhan. Reports conflicted about the
circumstances, with some saying the men were ambushed by Armenians
and others claiming they died in a car accident or killed each other
in a dispute.
   A 1 a.m.-5 a.m. curfew remained in force in Nagorno-Karabakh, a
two-month-old strike was keeping most businesses closed, and armored
personnel carriers patrolled the streets of Stepanakert.

   The director of the District of Columbia Jail
has overturned a decision that placed jailed plastic surgeon
Elizabeth Morgan in punitive confinement for possessing contraband
jewelry and perfume.
   Morgan, who has been held for 23 months on contempt charges for
failing to divulge the whereabouts of her 7-year-old daughter in a
child custody case, was sentenced to special confinement by a
disciplinary review board on Monday.
   A search of Morgan's cell uncovered earrings, a gold chain and
perfume that authorities said were not authorized.
   Jail director David Roach reversed the review board's ruling
Wednesday. ``The review panel had made some procedural errors'' in
reaching the decision, so Roach granted Morgan's appeal that she be
released from punishment that kept her in her cell 23 hours a day,
said corrections department spokeswoman Pat Wheeler.
   The spokeswoman did not specify what errors had been made but
said Morgan was being returned to the jail's general female inmate
population.

   U.S. Air Force officers helped rescue a
Canadian who was severely burned when a stove exploded and a fire
broke out aboard his yacht in the Atlantic Ocean, officials said
today.
   The sailor, Albert Edward Wilson of Ontario, Canada, was taken
from the burning 30-foot yacht Wednesday night, Portuguese air force
officials said. Wilson was the only person aboard the vessel.
   The officials said the sailor's distress call was heard at a U.S.
Air Force base in Lajes, on the Azores island of Terceira, and a
U.S. reconnaissance plane located the yacht while vessels rushed to
the scene.
   Wilson was saved about 130 miles west of the Azores, mid-Atlantic
islands owned by Portugal, the officials in the Azorian city of
Ponta Delgada said.
   Lorne Bawers, a Canadian ham operator in Charlottetown, Prince
Edward Island, said he was in contact with Wilson all night and that
the sailor was coherent and cheerful despite his ordeal.
   He said Wilson told him he was trying to circumnavigate the
Atlantic.
   Portuguese officials said Wilson was very badly burned. Reports
overheard by a ham radio reporter in Maine said Wilson was near
death after sustaining burns on his hands, arms, legs and stomach.
   Wilson was taken aboard a merchant ship identified as the
Charlotte Lake, they said, adding they did not know the nationality
of the ship.

   Three gunmen shot nine people on a crowded
street before leading police on a 12-mile chase that ended when
their vehicle smashed into patrol cars at a roadblock, police said
today.
   Police had no motive for the Wednesday night shootings, which
witnesses said appeared to be indiscriminate.
   ``All of a sudden I saw these dudes coming down the middle of the
street, shooting up in the air,'' said one witness, Ernie Dumas.
``They were saying things like `You think you're bad.'''
   Stamford police Lt. Joseph Falzetti said today that nine people
were wounded.
   ``None of the injuries are life threatening although some are
more serious than others,'' Stamford Deputy Police Chief John
Perrotta said.
   After firing at the people, the gunmen led police on a
circuitous, 60-mph car chase that ended in New Canaan when their car
crashed into two police cruisers and a stone wall, said New Canaan
Police Capt. Christopher Lynch.
   One of the suspects was listed in critical condition at St.
Joseph Medical Center in Stamford, a hospital official said. The
other two suspects are in serious condition.
   Charges were pending against the men, Perrotta said. Two were
identified as James McGraw, 18, and Damian Jackson, 21, both of New
York City. The third was not identified.
   Falzetti said five of the victims were taken to St. Joseph's;
four others were taken to Stamford Hospital. Each hospital treated
and released one person. The others remained hospitalized today in
serious conditon.

   A small aircraft, its pilot apparently unconscious
or dead, flew southward over the Atlantic Ocean off the East Coast
this morning and was rapidly running out of gas, officials said.
   Military jets and a cargo plane with a parachute rescue team
aboard chased the twin-engine Cessna 210 as it flew down the coast.
   The unidentified pilot reported to air traffic controllers at
8:30 a.m. that he was having chest pains and difficulty breathing.
   ``There has been nothing more from the pilot,'' said Fred Farrar,
a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman in Washington.
   Pilots who tracked the plane later said he appeared to be slumped
over the controls. There was no one else visible in the plane,
officials said.
   Officials gave conflicting reports on how much fuel the plane,
apparently on autopilot, had left at midmorning and on its location.
Farrar said that at 10 a.m. the plane was about 250 miles northeast
of Brunswick, Ga.
   Farrar said the plane would run out of gas about 11:30 a.m.,
while Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Karonis of the Coast Guard said the pilot
indicated at 8:30 a.m. that he had four hours of fuel left.
   Steve Sapp, Coast Guard spokesman in Miami, said an Air Force
C-130 with a parachute rescue team aboard and a Coast Guard C-130
plane were following the plane down the coast. If it runs out of
fuel at 11:30 a.m., he said, it would be about 250 miles east of
Cape Canaveral.
   ``There's apparently nothing more we can do until it splashes
down,'' Sapp said. ``When it does, the pararescue people will jump
out of the plane.''
   A helicopter would likely be sent from the Coast Guard's Cape
Canaveral station, he said.
   The Cessna aircraft took off from Washington National Airport at
about 6:30 a.m. Its flight plan indicated it was headed for Rocky
Mount, N.C., Farrar said.
   After its distress call, it was intercepted by two Marine Corps
F-A-18 Hornets when it entered Norfolk Naval Station airspace at
8:45 a.m., said Lt. Cmdr. Mike John, a Navy spokesman.
   The pilots of the intercepting planes saw the pilot slumped over
the controls, John said. The Marine fliers were unable to establish
voice contact with the Cessna pilot, he said.
   Karonis said the plane was flying steadily at 10,000 feet. He
said its heading varied from southeast to southwest ``as it gets
pushed about by the wind.''

<HEAD>Body Identified As That of AID Employee</HEAD>

   A body that ashed ashore near a southern
Mexican village six weeks ago has been tentatively identified as
that of an employee of the U.S. foreign aid agency who had been on a
hiking trip, U.S. officials said today.
   The officials said dental records appeared to confirm that the
victim was Frank Fairchild, 43, who went to Guatemala on a hiking
trip alone in May and crossed into Mexico on June 1.
   The cause of death has not been established. The remains have
been sent to Mexico City for further examination, said the
officials, who insisted on anonymity.
   Fairchild's body washed ashore at Puerto Arista, in the Mexican
state of Chiapas, on June 5 and was buried by Mexican authorities.
There was no identification on the body.
   The Mexican officials informed the State Department about the
incident after U.S. officials became concerned about Fairchild's
disappearance and began making inquiries about his whereabouts in
late June.
   Fairchild joined the Agency for International Development in 1979
and spent his first seven years with AID in Guatemala. He was
preparing for reassignment to Washington this summer after a
two-year tour of duty in Pakistan.
   Fairchild was born in Los Angeles and was raised in High Point,
N.C.

   NASA's chief said today a new government ethics
law that has cost his agency several top managers has created ``a
very disturbing situation.''
   ``There are people who have left who could have given us three or
four more years of service and that's a crying shame,'' Richard H.
Truly told a news conference.
   He spoke a day after Richard O. Aller, head of NASA's Office of
Space Operations, resigned. It was the ninth high-level agency
resignation this year and Aller was the third to say publicly he is
leaving because of the ethics law.
   Truly said the law, which becomes effective Sunday, has created
``a very disturbing situation.''
   ``We know of a few others who are making their final decisions
today and tomorrow literally,'' he said.
   ``It's not so much the number, but the quality and experience of
these people,'' he said. ``When 10 senior service executive people
leave you, they take with them 250 to 300 years of government
leadership and experience when they walk out the door.''
   The resignations and retirements have added to the management
woes of Truly, who was sworn in just two weeks ago as administrator
of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``Frankly, it's so vague and undefined that I'm not aware of
anybody in government or on Capitol Hill or in industry that really
understands its implications,'' Aller said of the ethics law after
his resignation was announced Wednesday.
   ``For one that had planned at some point in time to go into
private industry, (the law) almost insists that you resign before
the 16th of July,'' he said.
   The ethics law, aimed at curtailing the ``revolving door''
personnel relationship between some federal agencies and private
industry, takes effect Sunday after having been postponed once.
   The rules will bar federal contractors from hiring government
officials who have supervised their competitors' projects.
   Truly said that despite the losses, NASA still will be able to
manage its programs, ``but it's not a good situation and one we need
to deal with.''
   Another who is quitting Saturday is William Ballhaus, director of
NASA's Ames Research Center in California. NASA said Ballhaus was
unhappy with ``inadequate compensation for senior federal executives
and vague new post-government employment regulations.''
   ``My family situation is such that public service in the current
environment is no longer a viable option for me,'' said Ballhaus,
who had been with the agency for 18 years.
   Aller joined NASA in 1964 and was deeply involved in the Apollo
program, which culminated in man's first landing on the moon. NASA
celebrations of that anniversary next week are expected to include a
call by President Bush for a revitalized space program perhaps
including a goal of landing on Mars or colonizing the moon.
   NASA's announcement said Aller ``accelerated his departure
because of the vague new post-government employee regulations'' and
because of ``many disappointments in the treatment of government
employees.''
   Among those disappointments, Aller told a reporter, are the pay
caps that have been imposed for several years on members of the
Senior Executive Service of which Aller is a member. President Bush
last week proposed a substantial pay increase for the SES.
   John Logsdon, a space analyst at George Washington University in
Washington, characterized the law recently as ``a sledgehammer
instead of (the) scalpel it was supposed to be.''
   NASA's No. 3 official, Dr. Noel Hinners resigned effective May 14
_ a day before the new law had been expected to go into effect _
citing ``uncertainty in interpretation of new post-employment laws.''
   John Thomas, who was in charge of the effort to redesign the
space shuttle's solid rocket boosters at the Marshall Space Flight
Center, resigned and went to work as an executive in the Lockheed
Space Operations Company at the Kennedy Space Center.
   The other resignations included E. Ray Tanner, deputy director of
space station operations, in June, after only five months on the
job; James Odom, associate administrator for space station, in April
after a year in the post, and Thomas L. Moser, acting associate
administrator for space stations for less than a month when he left
in May.

   A former furniture salesman testified
today that former PTL executives David and James Taggart used a PTL
credit card to pay off a $15,000 debt for furniture that was
delivered to their New York apartment.
   Preston Mitchell, who worked at the Mecklenburg Design Center in
Charlotte in 1985, said the Taggarts purchased more than $20,000
worth of furniture for their $640,000 one-bedroom apartment in Trump
Tower. Mitchell said he went to New York to set up the sofas,
tables, custom area rug and chairs.
   The Taggarts are charged with evading $487,000 in federal income
taxes from 1984 to 1987.
   Mitchell said David Taggart used a credit card issue to PTL to
pay off the $15,350 balance on the purchase. The credit card receipt
introduced by Justice Department prosecutor David Brown carried a
hand-written notation that the furniture was purchased for the
Heritage Grand Hotel.
   The hotel is on the grounds of Heritage USA, the PTL Christian
theme park south of Charlotte.
   Brown also entered documents showing David Taggart had used his
personal credit card to purchase $6,200 in bedroom furniture for the
Taggarts' home in Charlotte.
   A handwritten note on that charge slip indicated the canopy bed,
mattress and armoire were to be used in the presidential suite at
the Heritage Grand Hotel, the suite used by PTL founder Jim Bakker.
   On Wednesday, friends of the Taggarts testified that the two told
friends their wealth came from a family inheritance.
   ``They told me about growing up in Detroit, that they got an
inheritance from their grandfather,'' Penny Hollenbeck, who became
friends with David and James Taggart when they worked together at
PTL in the early 1980s, testified for the prosecution Wednesday.
   Federal prosecutors say the brothers diverted $1.1 million of
ministry funds to their personal use by taking cash advances on PTL
credit cards and using blank ministry checks to pay the credit card
bills. They have argued that the Taggarts lied even to their closest
friends about the source of their wealth to conceal their actions.
   Eugene Shelton IV, another former PTL aide and friend of the
Taggarts, said he asked David Taggart about his money while the two
were on a trip to Florida in 1985.
   ``I believe I was blunt, I came out and asked,'' Shelton said.
``He told me he had received a trust fund from family ... I believe
from his parents. It was $6 million _ $3 million each.''
   Last week, testimony from the Taggarts' father, Henry Taggart,
established that the claims of family wealth recalled by their PTL
co-workers were false.
   Two women who described themselves as longtime friends of the
Taggarts described being taken on expensive trips to California,
Florida and London.
   Lucinda McLellan and Darlene Peterson said the trips included
$3,000 hotel bills, dinners costing $600 each and shopping sprees
that cost several thousand dollars.
   In other testimony, a representative from a New York City fur
shop said the Taggarts spent about $35,000 on mink coats and other
furs for themselves at her store. And a salesman for a New York shoe
store said the Taggarts spent nearly $100,000 from 1982-86 on shoes
for themselves.
   Television evangelist Rex Humbard, a former PTL board member,
testified that he keeps tight spending controls at his ministry in
Boca Raton, Fla.
   ``Nobody in our organization is authorized to spend more than
$10,000 outside the budget without authorization from the board of
directors.''
   If convicted on the tax evasion charges, the Taggarts each could
be sentenced to 25 years in prison and face fines totaling about $1
million.

   A volcano erupted near an uninhabited island today,
spewing plumes of steam and smoke into the air and raising concerns
about a region of the nation where thousands of earthquakes have
occurred recently.
   The eruption happened at 6:30 p.m. about 1{ miles northeast of
the island of Teishijima, the Central Meteorological Agency reported.
   The island is just off the coast of Ito city on the Izu
peninsula, 60 miles southwest of Tokyo. The extent of the volcanic
activity several hundred yards beneath the ocean's surface was not
immediately known, the agency said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries, and a tsunami, or
seismic wave caused by earthquakes or volcanic activity, was not
expected, the agency said. However, it issued a navigation warning
to ships operating in the area.
   Many people in Ito, a seaside spa known for its many hot springs,
were seen leaving their homes, but no evacuation order was issued,
the Japan Broadcasting Corp. said. Hundreds of people called local
officials asking about the volcano.
   ``Right now, we don't know if this will lead to another, larger
eruption and can only tell people there to watch for further
warnings,'' said a Central Meteorological Agency official who
requested anonymity. ``Obviously, there could be danger to Ito if a
larger eruption occurs.''
   More than 20,000 earthquakes have been recorded around Izu over
the past two weeks, and officials from the Construction Ministry's
Geographical Survey Institute began today to check movement of the
earth's crust at Ito, the town nearest the epicenter. Ito has a
population of 72,000.
   Also seismologists from the University of Tokyo started surveying
the movements of underground magma with monitoring equipment in Ito.
   The stepped-up investigations followed an emergency meeting late
Wednesday of the government's Coordinating Committee for Earthquake
Prediction, which called for ``careful monitoring'' of the
continuing earthquakes.
   The 16-member committee, led by Professor Daisuke Shimozuru of
the University of Tokyo, said in a statement that the successive
minor quakes occurring since Tuesday night ``may be caused by
activities of underground magma, and there is a need to monitor them
carefully.''
   Two million people visited Ito last year, where there are 450
inns and hotels for visitors, Hidekatsu Takei, acting director of
the Hot Spring Tourist Cooperatives in Ito, told The Associated
Press.

   The Soviet Union today welcomed a U.S. effort to
speed up negotiations to reduce conventional forces in Europe and
said a deal might be possible within six months.
   ``We have no intention of delaying this important matter of
reducing the level of military confrontation,'' said the Foreign
Ministry spokesman, Gennady Gerasimov. But he said it might be hard
to meet a Bush administration proposal to make the cuts by 1992.
   President Bush proposed at a NATO summit May 29 that the United
States and Soviet Union reduce their troop levels to 275,000 each in
central Europe.
   According to NATO, that would mean a reduction of 30,000 U.S.
troops from Europe, and a cut by the Soviet Union of more than 10
times that, or 325,000 troops.
   Gerasimov said that in general the NATO ideas ``are viewed by us
as serious and constructive proposals, meeting our own proposals
halfway.''
   The Soviet spokesman noted that President Bush ``also proposed to
conclude an agreement on conventional forces during the next six to
12 months and aim to comply with this agreement in 1991-92.
   ``The Vienna talks, given a constructive approach, can arrive at
specific agreements by next year. We will do everything to reach
those agreements within six months.
   ``Of course, to reduce substantial numbers of personnel and
material by 1992 is not an easy matter. We may suppose that the
schedule proposed is an unusual one for NATO countries and has been
created mostly by political considerations,'' he said.
   Gerasimov did not comment on a proposal by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III to limit each side to a ceiling of 5,700 combat
aircraft, of which 1,900 would be helicopters.
   The official Tass news agency, however, said the NATO proposal
contained some ``disturbing points,'' especially the inclusion of
combat aircraft able to carry out both offensive and defensive
missions.
   ``It is precisely strike aircraft of frontline (tactical)
aviation that constitute an important component of surprise attack
capability. NATO has a considerable advantage in this area,'' Tass
commentator Vladimir Chernyshev said.
   Gerasimov also noted that Soviet and U.S. warships would pay
reciprocal visits this summer in a program of expanding military
cooperation.
   From July 21-25, the cruiser Usinov will be among the Soviet
warships visiting visit Norfolk, Va., home of the U.S. Atlantic
Fleet.
   From Aug. 4-6, U.S. Navy ships will return the visit by stopping
at Sevastapol on the Black Sea.
   The visits will be the first of their kind in 14 years, said
Gerasimov.

<TEXT>
   Paula R. Cooper, convicted of a murder
committed when she was 15, cannot be executed, the Indiana Supreme
Court ruled today.
   The court unanimously upheld Cooper's conviction in the 1985
stabbing death of an elderly Bible teacher but said she should be
sentenced to 60 years in prison.
   Cooper's case has drawn international attention, and in 1987 Pope
John Paul II appealed for mercy on her behalf.
   The court based its decision on a 1987 change in Indiana law
raising the minimum age for a death penalty defendant from 10 to 16
and on a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision barring executions of
juveniles under 16 at the time of the crime.
   But the court said although the law was compelling, ``this is a
difficult conclusion to reach because of the gruesome nature of
Cooper's acts.''
   ``We won! I'm elated, relieved,'' said Cooper's attorney, William
Touchette. ``I'm very happy for Paula. I'm just so relieved that
this is over. It was not an easy case.''
   Cooper pleaded guilty to the stabbing death of Ruth E. Pelke, 78,
a retired Bible teacher in Gary. According to court records, Pelke
was stabbed 33 times after Cooper and three friends broke into her
home to get money and jewelry.
   The three other young women received prison terms ranging from 25
to 60 years for their roles in the crime.
   Cooper, now 18, is an inmate at the Indiana Women's Prison in
Indianapolis.
   Roman Catholics and some European leftist groups have adopted
Cooper as the figurehead of their campaign against capital
punishment. Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties
Union have also pleaded on her behalf.
   In March an Italian group presented a petition with 1 million
signatures to United Nations officials urging clemency for Cooper,
and in 1987 the pope wrote to then-Gov. Robert D. Orr to ask for
mercy for the young woman.
   Orr and current Gov. Evan Bayh have said they didn't want to
intervene in the Cooper case until the appeal was resolved.
   In today's opinion, the Supreme Court concluded that executing
Cooper would be unfair because she would be the only person under 16
ever executed in the state.
   The General Assembly, after much debate in 1987, changed the
minimum age for a death penalty defendant but made it clear that
Cooper wasn't to be affected by the change. But the court said
exempting Cooper from the change is inappropriate.
   ``Now that Indiana law establishes 16 as the minimum age for the
imposition of the death penalty, Paula Cooper would be both the
first and last person ever to be executed in Indiana for a crime
committed at the age of 15,'' Chief Justice Randall T. Shepard wrote
for the court.
   ``This makes her sentence unique and disproportionate to any
other sentence for the same crime,'' Shepard wrote.
   The state court also said that last year's divided U.S. Supreme
Court ruling on an Oklahoma case signals that four justices believe
``it is cruel and unusual punishment to execute a juvenile convicted
of a murder committed before the age of 16, and one justice believes
it is unconstitutional to executive a juvenile unless the death
penalty itself identifies a minimum age for the death penalty.''
   While sparing Cooper from the electric chair, the Supreme Court
said the circumstances surrounding her crime ``clearly support the
next most severe penalty under the statute, namely, the maximum
sentence of imprisonment.''
   Cooper will be eligible to apply for parole after serving half of
the 60-year sentence.

   Firefighters finished digging a fire lane around a blaze that
burned tens of thousands of acres in Nebraska, and officials in New
Mexico tried to steer endangered trout to waters free of ash from a
nearby forest fire.
   Crews were released from sites in several Western states
Wednesday as wet weather helped firefighters bring several blazes
under control.
   ``We have rain ... it's cooler and we've got firefighters going
home. Isn't that good news?'' asked U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman
Merle Young in Utah, where three fires burning on more than 20,000
acres were subdued.
   The number of firefighters battling active blazes was expected to
fall to around 5,000 today from more than 11,000 as recently as
Tuesday, the Boise Interagency Fire Center reported. Firefighters
were winding up work in Arizona, New Mexico, California, Colorado,
Wyoming, Utah and Nebraska.
   ``Every fire that we have has been contained or will be contained
today or Friday,'' Arnold Hartigan, spokesman at the Boise center,
said this morning. ``We're doing very well with the fires.''
   The weather forecast also continued to be good, with more rain
and higher humidity in most regions, he said.
   In Colorado, a half-inch of rain fell in Boulder Canyon, helping
crews fighting a 2,000-acre fire that destroyed 37 homes and damaged
19 other buildings. The blaze was contained, or surrounded,
Wednesday and declared under control this morning. A 2,600-acre fire
in Mesa Verde National Park was controlled without damaging ruins
left by 13th century Anasazi Indians.
   But a 2,000-acre blaze in Colorado's Poudre Canyon was still to
be contained, officials said, and they weren't planning on anything
more than a brief respite.
   ``If we had two days of 98 degrees, we'd be right back where we
were Sunday,'' said fire information officer Ed Nesselroad.
   Officials in California pushed back the target for containing a
2,900-acre fire in rough terrain near Big Sur to Friday evening,
said Maeton Freel, a Forest Service spokesman. More than 900
firefighters had contained a little more than half of the blaze,
which investigators believe was started by an arsonist, he said.
   A wildfire that temporarily shut busy Interstate 15 between the
San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains east of Los Angeles was
partially contained before it could threaten a housing development,
authorities said. About 100 firefighters battled the blaze in
100-degree heat and 35 mph winds.
   Crews in northwest Nebraska used heavy equipment and shovels to
encircle a grass and tree fire in an area eight miles wide by 22
miles long.
   ``We have fully contained the fire,'' said Jerry Larson, deputy
state fire marshal. ``Full control could be a couple of days and an
exact estimate on burned acreage can be made after that.''
   After flying over the area, Larson scaled back the size of the
fire to between 50,000 and 100,000 acres from more than 100,000
acres. The Forest Service confirmed at least 48,000 acres had
burned, he said.
   The lightning-caused fire destroyed 14 unoccupied structures but
spared buildings in historic Fort Robinson, an old cavalry post
where Sioux Chief Crazy Horse was killed by his jailers.
   The blaze burned nearly half of 22,000-acre Fort Robinson State
Park, but officials planned to reopen it Friday, said state parks
chief Charles Duncan.
   ``I'm sure we'll get some people in here out of curiosity, but
this is still a beautiful place,'' he said.
   In southwest New Mexico, rainfall on Tuesday washed ash from a
10,000-acre blaze in the Gila National Forest into Diamond Creek,
threatening Gila trout, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Andrea
Garcia said.
   Biologists began luring the trout into a mile-long section of
clear water in the creek on Wednesday and planned to transfer the
fish to nearby holding areas today with helicopters and mules.
   Most fire crews headed home from the Gila fire, which was
contained Monday, as well as from two fires contained Wednesday in
El Malpais National Monument, which burned a total of about 5,400
acres, said Nancy Neskauskas of the state forestry office.
   In Arizona, firefighters hoped to contain today the last large
fires, a 800-acre fire near Lake Havasu City in the west-central
part of the state. Others began leaving for other states still
threatened by fires, and 360,000 acres in the Coconino and
Apache-Sitgreaves national forests in the northern and eastern
sections of the state were reopened to the public.
   ``We're winding down,'' said U.S. Bureau of Land Management
spokesman Gordon Warren.
   In eastern Utah, crews began going home after the 4,500-acre Ryan
Creek fire near the Colorado line was contained Wednesday evening.
Firefighters extinguished two other fires that burned nearly 18,000
acres, but officials still battled a 100-acre fire in steep terrain
in Desolation Canyon.

   Tommy Tucker, a big band leader of the
1940s, died of heart failure in a hospital Tuesday. He was 86.
   Tucker led his traveling dance band, Tommy Tucker and his
Orchestra, in worldwide appearances from 1936-1958.
   Tucker, who played the piano, trumpet and trombone, was familiar
to radio fans who tuned into the shows ``Sing for Your Supper with
Tommy Tucker,'' ``Thirty Minutes in Hollywood'' and ``Hit Parade.''
And he made numerous television appearances on ``The Kate Smith
Show,'' ``Cavalcade of Bands,'' ``Arthur Murray House Party'' and

   Funerals for 14 people killed by an
emotionally troubled farmer who went on a rampage with a shotgun
will replace Bastille Day festivities in this small, close-knit
village, the mayor said today.
   Christian Dornier killed his mother and sister and wounded his
father Wednesday before getting in his car and driving around
shooting at everyone in his path, police said. The dead included
several children.
   Authorities said Dornier, who is about 30, wounded nine people,
including a police captain, and was himself shot and wounded before
being captured.
   Mayor Roger Clausse, whose 5-year-old niece was among those
killed, said Dornier was believed angered by his elderly father's
decision not to turn over to him management of the family farm in
Luxiol, which is near the Swiss border.
   He said funerals would be held Friday in this village of 128
people and the nearby communities of Baumes-les-Dames, Verne and
Voillans.
   Street dances and fireworks displays scheduled in
Baumes-les-Dames were canceled and will be replaced by a solemn
ceremony with placing of wreaths in memory of the victims.
   All over France, the traditional July 14 celebrations were to be
especially lively this year in honor of the 200th anniversary of the
storming of the Bastille prison in the French Revolution.
   A French anti-hunting group called for tighter controls on
firearms used by hunters, which are much easier to get than tightly
regulated handguns and other weapons. The Rally of Opponents to
Hunting issued a statement urging tougher laws on the possession of
hunting weapons that would ``take them away from people under
medical treatment and away from hunters out of season.''
   The mayor's son, Joel Clausse, said today that he was upstairs at
home when Dornier drove toward him shooting. He said he shot at
Dornier from an upstairs window with a rifle and wounded him, but
not badly enough to stop him.
   ``I saw the blood spurting out of his neck,'' Joel Clausse said.
Dornier then continued on until he was finally stopped by police
gunfire in the village of Autechaux, 1.5 miles from Luxiol, the
mayor's son said.
   The mayor said 40 officers had given chase.
   Police said Dornier had been working on his father's farm. Roger
Clausse said Dornier was known in the village to be emotionally
troubled.
   Archbishop Lucien Daloz from the nearby city of Besancon was
among the mourners who came to visit the makeshift chapel at City
Hall where the bodies of six of the victims were laid. Besides the
mayor's niece, a 10-year-old girl was also among the dead, police
said.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse said a local police
spokesman, whom it did not identify, called Dornier ``a huge man,
solitary and wild, someone who inspires fear.''
   Police at their regional headquarters in Besancon said the 14
were killed by buckshot.
   Georges Dornier, the suspect's uncle, said in a telephone
interview Wednesday that his nephew was ``mildly depressive. I saw
him this morning, and he was very calm.''
   A neighbor of Dornier, Marie-Therese Barraud, said she hid behind
a wall as he fired shots into her kitchen. ``My husband, who was
outside, was shot in the legs and the head. He's in the hospital,''
she said by telephone.
   ``I knew he was sick, he had shot at my husband once before,''
Mrs. Barraud said of Dornier. ``Our neighbors advised us not to go
out in our garden.''
   A young woman reached by telephone in Luxiol said she heard
gunshots that she thought at first were firecrackers.
   ``Then a neighbor told me a black car was driving around the
village and the driver was shooting at everybody,'' she said on
condition of anonymity. ``I went to tell the mayor. I saw an old
woman lying on the ground dead.''
   Premier Michel Rocard sent a telegram to the mayor of Luxiol
offering condolences. The village is about 275 miles southeast of
Paris.
   The mass killing was the worst in memory for France. Death tolls
have been higher in similar recent attacks in the United States and
Britain.
   In San Ysidro, Calif., James Huberty shot and killed 21 people
and injured 19 others at a McDonald's restaurant on July 18, 1984.
   On Aug. 19, 1987, in Hungerford in southwestern England, Michael
Ryan killed 16 bystanders with an assault rifle and revolver before
he was killed.
   Under French gun-control regulations, a license is required to
buy a shotgun. Handguns and assault rifles, which are more tightly
controlled, are very rare in this country.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today dismissed
reports that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is unable to meet
a NATO target date for the Soviet Union to reduce its conventional
military forces.
   ``The idea that some Soviet spokesman yesterday said they can't
meet these timetables _ I don't want to believe that that's Mr.
Gorbachev speaking,'' the president said in an impromptu news
conference as Air Force One flew to Paris from a two-night stop in
Budapest, Hungary, the second leg of a 10-day trip.
   Lt. Gen. Viktor Starodubov, chief of the disarmament branch of
the Communist Party's policy-making central committee, said Tuesday
that Moscow would not be able to meet the timetable.
   The Soviet official said that although Gorbachev, like the
Western nations, is seeking an early agreement, ``there are
realities which cannot be suppressed.''
   ``Experience shows that even when the principal elements are
resolved, we need a considerably longer period for solving the
details of the document,'' Starodubov said.
   In Moscow today, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov provided a more tempered response, saying his country
welcomed a U.S. effort to speed up negotiations to reduce
conventional forces and indicated that a deal might be possible
within six months.
   ``We have no intention of delaying this important matter of
reducing the level of military confrontation,'' said Gerasimov who
was questioned about the NATO proposal submitted today.
   But the Soviet official said reductions in ``substantial numbers
of personnel and material by 1992 is not an easy matter. We may
suppose that the chedule proposed is an unusual one for NATO
countries and has been created mostly be political considerations.''
   Gerasimov did not comment on Starodubov's remarks Tuesday.
   The NATO proposal calls for military cutbacks that would fix the
same ceiling of 275,000 troops in Europe for each superpower.
According to NATO statistics, that would require the United States
to remove 30,000 troops from Europe while the Soviets would have to
pull out more than 10 times that, or 325,000.
   The proposal, which also includes deep cuts in armaments, called
for reaching agreement in six months to a year, and for reductions
to be carried out by 1992 or 1993.
   The NATO members, seeking an early agreement at talks in Vienna
on conventional disarmament, submitted a proposal today that
specifies the types of combat aircraft it wants covered by an arms
accord.
   Bush told reporters that he is convinced that ``Gorbachev knows
that we're serious. Indeed we have an opportunity now to encourage
him to move along faster on conventional force reduction.''
   The president also said his journey to Poland and Hungary had
been ``watched by the people of other Eastern European countries and
hopefully given encouragement to those who want to go the path of
reform, political change, economic change.''
   On the Middle East, Bush said the United States will not overhaul
its policy on the Middle East in response to political turmoil in
Israel, a nation he said is having ``great difficulties.''
   Bush emphasized that Israel should go forward with elections
among Palestinians in the occupied territories as a step toward
peace.
   Amid charges that the United States is meddling in Israeli
politics, Bush said, ``The U.S. policy is set. I am the president of
the United States. Israel is a friend and will remain a friend. but
I have to say what our policy is.
   ``I don't think there is great heartburn here but I just want to
continue to articulate what we believe,'' he said.
   The decision by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc to
harden its stand on peace negotiations has strained U.S.-Israeli
relations. In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State John H. Kelly
said hard-liners are damaging prospects for Palestinian elections in
the occupied lands.
   ``If anybody can make a case to me that the recent deliberations
in that (Likud) party will enhance the election process, then I
would say `great.' But I am afraid that other people are looking at
it and saying that what has happened does not enhance the possiblity
of elections,'' the president said.
   The Bush administration plans to send an emissary to Israel to
discuss U.S. differences with its longtime ally, but the president
said, ``there are no plans for high-level shuttle diplomacy.''

<HEAD>Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Urges Bill to Outlaw Flag Burning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
today urged a House panel to pass quickly his bill to outlaw flag
burning, but other lawmakers said nothing short of a constitutional
amendment would suffice.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said regular legislation was the best
way ``swiftly and simply'' to overcome the Supreme Court ruling last
month that protected flag burning as a form of free speech.
   ``No matter how we cut it, a constitutional amendment is going to
take some time'' and leave a gap in the law during which flag
burning would remain legal, Biden said. A bill could take effect
almost immediately, and if it still didn't meet constitutional
muster, then an amendment could be pursued, he said.
   ``Let's heal the wound, pass the legislation and move on,'' urged
Biden.
   Biden's testimony came as the House subcommittee on
constitutional law opened a series of hearings on what to do about
the Supreme Court ruling.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., testified in favor of
the constitutional amendment supported by President Bush.
   ``We believe there is no quick legislative fix on this issue,''
said Michel, who was joined by Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss.,
chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said he opposed a constitutional
amendment on flag burning, although he conceded most people
disagreed with him.
   ``It is that very freedom, the right to protest even when it is
offensive, that makes us different from the rest of the world,'' he
said, comparing the United States with the current repression
against protesters in China.
   Legislative efforts short of an amendment might be impossible, he
said.
   ``I'm not certain it is possible to draft a constitutionally
solid statute,'' he said.
   Subcommittee chairman Don Edwards, D-Calif., urged his colleagues
to be cautious.
   ``The flag is sturdy, flying proudly through every fierce battle
of every war and through times of social upheaval,'' he said. ``The
Constitution, however, is fragile and can be amended by the votes of
legislators caught up in the emotional whirlwinds of the moment.''
   Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the ranking Republican on
the subcommittee, said he believed the constitutional amendment
should be quickly passed and sent to the states for ratification
because of the uncertainty that a statute would hold.
   ``If we want to heal the wounds'' of the Supreme Court decision,
``we ought to make sure the patient doesn't have a relapse,'' he
said.

   The health gap between white and non-white
Americans is widening, and closing the disparity will be tough,
Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan told the NAACP
today.
   Sullivan, the third member of the Bush administration to address
the civil rights group's national convention, spoke a day after Vice
President Dan Quayle. House and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp spoke on Monday.
   ``There is a large, and growing disparity in the health of our
minority population and the white population,'' Sullivan said.
   He said the average life expectancy was up to 74.8 years in 1986.
   ``But the shocking news is that, for the second year in a row,
the life expectancy for black Americans declined _ falling to 69.4
years, having been 69.5 in 1985 and 69.7 years in 1984,'' he said.
   Those figures, and the infant-mortality rate that is twice that
of whites, are ``a national tragedy,'' said Sullivan, who is black.
   Sullivan said the Bush administration favored a plan to make
Medicaid more available to infants and pregnant women and increase
funding for demonstration projects on maternity care.
   Quayle told delegates that President Bush was committed to civil
rights and black economic progress. Some listeners weren't impressed.
   ``His speech lacked any real substance,'' said Keith M. Jones,
president of the New Jersey branch of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People. ``This administration vetoed a
minimum wage bill and there is nothing kinder and gentler about
that.''
   The convention closes tonight with a speech by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson.
   In his speech to nearly 3,000 delegates Wednesday, Quayle did not
address one of the hotter convention topics _ recent U.S. Supreme
Court decisions that have been interpreted as setbacks for civil
rights.
   The high court struck down contract guarantees for minority firms
and made it tougher to prove bias in the workplace, while making it
easier for white males to contest affirmative action.
   When pressed on the issue later at a news conference, Quayle
said, ``The president does not feel that those decisions need to be
overturned to advance the cause of civil rights.''
   He said the president might reconsider if the impact of the
rulings proves discriminatory.
   Quayle was asked if the president planned to respond to the
decisions affecting civil rights with a constitutional amendment
like the one he proposed to counter a ruling that upheld
constitutional protection for burning the American flag.
   ``He feels very strongly about civil rights, he's talking about
civil rights, he's talking about decency,'' Quayle said.
   Earlier, Quayle told delegates: ``I am committed and President
Bush is committed to fostering good and better relations with the
civil rights community.''
   Bush has met with civil rights leaders in the White House and
held ceremonies honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King's legacy and
observing the 25th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
Quayle said.
   He cited equal opportunity programs including the Job Training
Partnership Act that he co-wrote as a senator, and educational
initiatives including establishment of a $60 million fund during the
next four years to build endowments of historically black colleges
and universities.
   ``We are the ones who are going to give a person a job,'' Quayle
said.
   On the Supreme Court's decision giving states more power to
regulate abortions, Quayle said he and the president won't take part
in state-level debates on the issue.
   But, he added, ``both of our positions are pro-life.''
   Quayle also said the administration stands behind its February
nomination of former Wayne County Executive William Lucas to head
the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division.
   Groups including the NAACP have opposed the black Republican.
NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks said Sunday that Lucas lacks
the necessary legal knowledge.
   ``We know of the opposition of the NAACP, and we have talked to
them about that, but we stand foursquare behind Bill Lucas,'' Quayle
told reporters.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the country:
   
   July 10
   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on President Bush's plan for federal
pay raises:
   President Bush faces a difficult task in selling Congress and the
American people on his broad and generous pay raise plan for federal
employees.
   It's not that some relief isn't probably justified overall,
critical for retention of key specialists in a few areas. It's just
that the federal government is low on money _ most taxpayers are too
_ and the economy is slowing down to boot.
   Public sentiment on public salaries was demonstrated unmistakably
in the congressional pay raise bloodbath earlier this year. Bush is
proposing hikes of from 8 to 25 percent for some 7,900 top
government employees, plus $100,000-plus salaries for a few hundred
specialists with critical skills. Administration spokesmen said they
had had many qualified government service candidates who couldn't
afford the pay cut to accept government service.
   Congress _ and the voters _ should educate themselves on this
situation before rejecting Bush's proposal out of hand.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   July 11
   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on Bush's pay plan:
   President Bush's proposal last week to give 7,900 federal
executives pay raises of 8 to 25 percent is both prudent and timely.
Congressional action authorizing the increase is merited.
   Equally worthy of approval is the president's additional proposal
to ban congressional honoraria, though he would delay it for 18
months. Honoraria should go immediately.
   The raise for senior government officials should have been
proposed first and separately from the proposed 51 percent
congressional pay raise that sank after an angry public outcry early
this year.
   The pay of these officials has eroded significantly in comparison
to comparable jobs in the private sector, and as a result, the
administration says, about 40 potential executives turned down
government appointments.

   Seattle Post-Intelligencer, on arms reduction:
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev continues to make dramatic
proposals and declarations that are ratcheting down the historic
tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States and its West
European allies.
   In France last week, at a meeting of the Council of Europe,
Gorbachev once again commanded world headlines by, in effect,
nullifying what has come to be known as the Brezhnev doctrine. That
was a seemingly bedrock philosophy that the Soviet Union was
justified in using force to keep communist-bloc nations of Eastern
Europe within the fold. ...
   Gorbachev's talk in France also sought to spur negotiations on
reductions of tactical nuclear weapons, which have represented the
cornerstone of U.S. and NATO deterrence to Warsaw Pact forces in
Europe.
   Bush is right to insist on a U.S.-Soviet agreement on
conventional force reductions prior to talks on tactical weapons,
which also is the adopted policy of NATO.
   As welcome as Gorbachev's tension-reducing overtures are, the
West must not be stampeded into risky arms agreements it might come
to regret.

   The Bulletin, Bend, Ore., on racial quotas:
   Some minorities, especially Asian-Americans, are discovering that
ethnic and racial quotas can cut both ways _ and that neither way is
very good for American society.
   The latest quota controversy stems from reports that many of the
nation's finest colleges and universities are explicitly limiting
admissions of Asian-Americans. At the University of California at
Berkeley, for example, officials admitted that their policies in
effect imposed a quota on the number of Asian-Americans accepted to
their school.
   Congress is in an uproar over the reports, and 23 members of the
House have co-sponsored a bill that would put Congress on record
against college admission ceilings based on racial or ethnic
origins. The bill shouldn't be necessary: The Civil Rights Act of
1964 prohibits discrimination based on race or ethnicity in any
institution that receives federal funding. ...
   All quotas erode the ability of employers (or college recruiters)
to hire or accept the best, most qualified people.

   The Honolulu Advertiser, on the sentencing of Oliver North:
   Oliver North's no-jail sentence is surprisingly light. It will do
little to remind the nation of the serious wrongs of the Iran-Contra
affair or to deter other gung-ho government officials from breaking
the law in the name of ``following orders.''
   The mild sentence is also a break for President Bush. It will
both reduce right-wing pressure for a North pardon and further
eclipse bids to find out what role Bush really had in the
Iran-Contra dealings. He can continue stonewalling.
   Few felt the former National Security Council aide should have
gotten the 10-year maximum sentence, but some time in custody would
have dramatized the seriousness of this affair.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   July 6
   The Rapid City (S.D.) Journal, on North's sentence:
   Oliver North may never understand, jingoists lack the ability to
understand, but U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell showed he
understood when he sentenced North Wednesday for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair. ...
   Gesell's sentence was just. North was a small fry caught in a net
designed to let larger fish go free. Putting North in prison would
not be wise. He poses no physical threat to others.
   Unless he is returned to a position of public trust, he is
unlikely to repeat his offenses. And North would not gain
understanding through imprisonment. He may gain understanding by
working with vulnerable youths trapped in a more important war than
the one North thought he was waging in Nicaragua _ the war to save
souls from the scourge of drugs.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   July 7
   The Bellingham (Wash.) Herald, on North's sentence:
   Instead of throwing the book at Oliver North, U.S. District Court
Judge Gerhard Gesell threw a handful of the pages and expressed the
hope that North, and the rest of the country, would get the message.
   That message is that North deserved punishment for misusing his
power as a National Security Council employee during the Iran-Contra
arms-for-hostages dealing, but that the punishment should fit not
only the crime but the criminal.
   Some observers believe North got off with a wrist-slap, and
should have done time in prison. Others, supporting North, believe a
$150,000 fine and a ban from holding public office is a high price
to have to pay for merely following orders. ...
   We probably all lack ``full understanding'' of the case, even
though it was widely reported. Left undocumented, for example, was
the extent of President Reagan's role in the illegal activities. But
one thing Gesell seemed to understand fully was that jailing North
would have achieved little more than making him an unjustified
martyr.
   Future Iran-Contra trials will help us understand more about the
case and North's role in it. Until then, the judge has relegated him
to minor-player status, which is probably where history will keep
him.

<TEXT>
   July 8
   San Luis Obispo County (Calif.) Telegram-Tribune, on North's
sentence:
   Oliver North has been spared going to jail. The fact remains
there was ample justification for putting him behind bars.
   Given his heroic war record and his bristling performance as a
super-patriot before, during and after his trial, the former Marine
colonel whipped up widespread sentiment against his going to prison.
   But it can be persuasively argued, it seems to us, that the
penalties imposed by Judge Gerhard Gesell were hardly commensurate
with the gravity of his crimes _ fraud, lying to Congress and
destruction of government documents ...
   At the same time _ and this no doubt was central to the judge's
determinations _ he held that North was ``not ... a leader at all''
in the Iran-Contra scandal but ``really a low-ranking subordinate
working to carry out initiatives of a few cynical superiors.''
   Gesell obviously was referring to the late CIA director William
Casey and John Poindexter and Robert MacFarlane, both former
national security directors.
   Much of the American public also believes that Ronald Reagan,
then president, was the most culpable superior ...
   His (North's) diehard supporters also are clamoring for a pardon.
President Bush, whose role in Iran-Contra also begs for further
examination, would be well advised to ignore such sentiment lest a
fresh firestorm of bitter debate sweep the country.

   The Providence (R.I) Journal-Bulletin, on use of animals to test
cosmetics:
   Two cheers for Avon and Revlon, the cosmetics manufacturers,
which recently announced that they would no longer use animals to
test new products. Both companies have been under siege in recent
years _ indeed the whole industry felt the pressure, here and in
Europe _ to stop using animals and start employing computer models,
existing safety records, and even human volunteers, for new formulas
and toiletries.
   It is not widely understood that a significant proportion of the
animals killed or injured annually in laboratories are not used for
medical research but for product testing.

   Bangor (Me.) Daily News, on Vietnamese immigrant's appointment to
U.S. Naval Academy:
   The latest wave of immigration, from Southeast Asia, is adding
cultural and ethnic diversity to this country, and it also is
re-energizing society, as eager people, aspiring and hungry to
achieve, work toward their goal of realizing a dream of freedom and
security in the United States.
   One man who personifies the spirit of the new wave is Thaison
Nguyen of Atlanta, Ga., who in 1983 successfully fled Vietnam in a
small boat, and was rescued at sea by a U.S. destroyer. Nguyen
started learning English in the eighth grade, and this month was
accepted into the U.S. Naval Academy. He had to ovecome initial
rejection because he was one-quarter inch too short (5 feet, 2
inches is the requirement); and his verbal skills were said to be
mediocre, but he was able to make a powerful, eloquent and
compelling case in his own behalf.
   Seen through the eyes of a naturalized citizen, who braved
gunfire and starvation for the opportunity to succeed, America looks
like a very different place:
   ``Somebody picked me out of the ocean, got me here, educated me,
and gave me a chance. This is my country.''
   America is fortunate to have him.

   Daily Record, Morristown, N.J., on changing American coins:
   If Diane Wolf of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts has her way the
nickel, the dime, the quarter, the half dollar and the penny could
all get a facelift. The U.S. Senate has already given its go-ahead
and the House appears to be right behind, leaving only President
Bush between the venerable, 70-year-old Lincoln penny and a more
modern 20th-century version.
   Commissioner Wolf says we're the ``only western country in the
world that hasn't changed its coins in recent years. We're the only
ones that have been stuck in a rut.''
   Doesn't sound broken to us, so why spend all the time, effort
and, assuredly, tax dollars on the project?

   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on President Bush's fireworks
show:
   What a bust! They came _ some 40,000 people _ and assembled in
Kennebunkport. The purpose of the assembly, attracting visitors from
far and near, was to celebrate the most important revolution in
history and to see a fireworks display which had received advance
hype as the American equivalent of a royal command performance: the
best in the world, because this is for the president.
   Then, when all was in readiness and the expectant throng stood
waiting for its thrill of thrills, it is reported that Barbara Bush
sent word to the fireworks maestro to in effect ``start early and
make it short.'' So in less than 15 minutes the anxiously awaited
``extravaganza'' was over _ to the acute disappointment of many
onlookers.
   It's still not clear why the fireworks display was cut short.
Considerations of safety to the president were cited, though it's
hard to see why no one thought of that beforehand. The president and
Mrs. Bush were reported to have spent part of the next morning
cleaning up after the display, so perhaps housekeeping was the issue.
   But since the town of Kennebunk canceled its fireworks show in
favor of the president's, expectations were naturally high. Next
year, the Bushes ought to deliver as promised, or withdraw from the
extravaganza buisness.

   Hundreds of cows rampaged through the
capital's crowded markets, injuring about 50 people waiting to buy
the animals for an Islamic celebration, officials said Thursday.
   Thousands of cows and goats were on sale in 20 bazaars for
sacrifice during Friday's Eid Al-Adha festival. Animal slaughter
during Eid is a traditional symbol of sacrifice.
   On Wednesday, police said, several hundred cows in the central
Fulbaria bazaar and Gabtali market on the northeastern outskirts
panicked because of noisy crowds.
   Eight people were admitted to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital
with head injuries, doctors said. The rest were treated and released.
   Eid al-Adha is the second-biggest Islamic holiday, observed 40
days after Ramadan, the month of fasting. About 90 percent of
Bangladesh's 110 million people are Moslems.

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a million Moslems today
descended Mount Arafat and crossed a scorching plain to the holy
city of Mecca for prayers culminating their annual pilgrimage.
   This year's pilgrimage, or hajj, to Saudi Arabia was conducted
under the guard of anti-terrorist security squads.
   The worshipers filed past the road in Mecca where two bombs
exploded Monday, killing one person and injuring 16.
   Waves of men in white seamless robes _ signifiying equality in
the eyes of Allah _ and women in long dresses and head scarves
participated in the prayer, broadcast live via satellite to scores
of countries.
   About 1.8 million Moslems came from more than 80 countries for
the hajj, which every financially able Moslem is expected to make at
least once.
   Iran boycotted this year's hajj to protest restrictions on the
number of pilgrims. Each nation was given a quota of 1,000 pilgrims
per million people.
   Iran alleged the restrictions were intended to limit the number
of Iranian pilgrims. It also accused Saudi authorities of
fabricating Monday's bomb incident to discredit Iran. The Saudis
have not accused Iran of planting the bombs.
   At twilight, the pilgrims offered the Eid Al-Adha, or Feast of
Sacrifice, prayers before slaughtering hundreds of thousands of
sheep, cows and camels.
   They then streamed down Mount Arafat to the Mina plain and on to
Mecca for the farewell prayer before dispersing. Arafat, Mina and
Mecca are all about four miles apart.
   Some pilgrims walked from Mina to Mecca, but most took advantage
of air-conditioned buses provided by the Saudis.
   In traditional messages, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and his crown
prince, Abdullah, made no mention of the bombings.
   The king said it was a ``sacred duty'' for him as ``custodian of
Islam's holiest shrines'' to complete renovation and modernization
plans at Mecca to provide pilgrims with better conditions for future
pilgrimages.
   Saudi Arabia cited the construction under way as the main reason
for curtailing the number of pilgrims. Limits on pilgrims first were
imposed in 1988.
   The previous year, demonstrations by thousands of the
150,000-strong Iranian hajj contingent led to clashes with Saudi
police. At least 402 people died, most of them Iranians.
   Scores of Iranians were arrested during the 1986 hajj when they
tried to bring in explosives.
   Princes and dignitaries from Arabia, merchants and paupers from
Bangladesh and India, Cossack and Tartars from the Soviet Union,
mingled with other pilgrims from Poland, Hungary, Spain, Senegal and
Indonesia _ all chanting in union ``Allah Akbar Kabeera,
Walhumdillah Katheera,'' Arabic for ``God is so great and to Him we
pay high tribute.''
   The hajj is performed during the Islamic lunar months of Shawwal,
Zul-Quideh and Zul-Hijjeh. Similar rituals performed out of the
season are called ``Umrah,'' or lesser hajj.
   The hajj proper is limited to six days. A pilgrim may commence
the rituals at any time during the three months, but the actual
congregational rites were conducted this year between July 8 and
July 13.
   Hajis are required to pray at the Grand Mosque in Mecca and
circle its Kaaba, a granite cube draped with gold-embroidered black
brocade. Moslems honor the Kaaba as the house of Allah. As they
circle the cube, pilgrims often bend to kiss the sacred black stoe
set in silver on the east corner of the granite structure.
   The pilgrims also run back and forth seven times between Safa and
Marwa, two hills 800 yards apart, enclosed within a huge mosque.
They commemorate the agony of Hagar, Abraham's estranged wife, who
ran frantically in the same spot searching for water for her son
Ismail, until Allah guided her to a spring.
   The spring today feeds the sacred well of Zamzam in the heart of
the Grand Mosque.
   When they go to Mina, each pilgrim throws seven stones at each of
the three ``devil pillars,'' a spot where Moslems believed the devil
tried to tempt Abraham to disobey Allah and refuse to sacrifice his
son.

   Black nationalist leader Nelson
Mandela said from prison that the white-led government can only end
the bloodshed in South Africa through dialogue with the banned
African National Congress.
   ``I would also like to confirm that my release is not an issue at
this stage,'' said Mandela, who heads the ANC. ``I only would like
to contribute to the creation of the climate which would promote
peace in South Africa.''
   Mandela met for 45 minutes on July 5 with President P.W. Botha at
the president's Cape Town residence, and the report fueled
speculation that the man considered the leader of South Africa's 28
million blacks may soon be freed.
   The statement Wednesday from Mandela, who has been in prison for
more than 26 years, was his first since 1985 that was approved by
the government for public releace.
   ``Dialogue with the mass democratic movement, and in particular
with the African National Congress, is the only way of ending
violence and bringing peace to our country,'' he said.
   Anti-apartheid groups, which initially dismissed the talks as
government propaganda, later called the meeting a positive
development.
   For example, anti-apartheid leader Frank Chikane, head of the
South African Council of Churches, on Wednesday said the meeting was
a ``calculated attempt by the government to make maximum political
gain.''
   But on Thursday, Chikane said: ``I welcome Mr. Mandela's
commitment to contribute in any way possible to the creation of a
climate which will promote peace in South Africa.''
   Mandela, who is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting
to overthrow the government, has over the years occasionally sent
messages out through his lawyer and other visitors.
   The ANC is the leading guerrilla group fighting apartheid, under
which South Africa's black majority has no vote in national affairs.
It is based in Lusaka, Zambia and seeks a South African state based
on one man, one vote.
   Neither the president nor his heir apparent, National Party
leader F.W. de Klerk, have commented on the Botha-Mandela meeting.
The government announced the talks in a brief statement Saturday,
but nothing has been added since.
   Botha has said he wants to create conditions to free Mandela and
has dropped his requirement that the founder of the guerrilla
movement's military wing renounce violence. Instead, he has talked
of political prisoners being willing to work for peace.
   ``There is something Oriental in the way (Mandela) has turned
weakness into power,'' Business Day, the country's leading financial
daily, said today.
   ``He has achieved much by doing virtually nothing, forcing his
jailers progressively to ease the conditions of his release,'' the
editorial added. ``It is not too much to say that the government is
now the prisoner of its prisoner: it cannot escape his embrace.''
   In 1985, Botha gave permission for a statement from Mandela to be
read at a rally in Soweto, the black township outside Johannesburg
where the black leader's family lives.
   Mandela's daughter, Zindzi, read the statement before a huge
crowd.
   It was Mandela's response to Botha's offer to release him if he
would renounce violence. Mandela refused, saying Botha should
renounce violence and racial segregation.
   ``Only free men can negotiate,'' Mandela said in 1985.
``Prisoners cannot enter into contracts.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was quoted Wednesday as
saying Mandela's release is crucial.
   ``No black South African will accept negotiating with the
government as long as Mandela is in prison. ... But I believe there
is now a hope of seeing him freed, although I have received no
guarantee,'' she was quoted as saying in an interview with the Paris
newspaper Le Monde.
   The South African Press Association quoted Mrs. Mandela as
saying, ``We do not condemn the meeting at all. ... For us to get to
the negotiation table, we have to start somewhere. We believe we
would have to talk to the government at some stage or another.''

<TEXT>
   Parliament voted today to investigate a
former minister accused of responsibility for a major agricultural
scandal that defrauded the European Economic Community.
   Nikos Athanasopoulos, deputy finance minister in the former
Socialist government, is accused of arranging for a shipment of
9,000 tons of Yugoslav corn to be issued with Greek certificates of
origin in 1986 and sold to a member state of the European Community
by a Greek state company.
   The European Court ruled against Greece in May this year, citing
lost revenues of $2 million which should have been paid on corn
imported from a non-member country. Sentencing is expected later
this year.
   Legislators from the conservative New Democracy party claimed in
Parliament that Greece will be made to pay at least $3.6 million in
reparations.
   Legislators from the governing alliance of the New Democracy and
the Coalition of the Left and Progress carried the motion to
investigate Athanasopoulos with 168 votes in the 300-member
Parliament.
   The Panhellenic Socialist Movement, which was swept from office
amid a series of scandals in June 18 elections, abstained from the
vote.
   Athanasopoulos, who was not re-elected, submitted a memorandum
denying involvement in the scandal.
   ``We have to note our international disgrace and the irreparable
ethical damage done to our country in the eyes of our community
partners,'' said one legislator.
   ``Where did the money go?'' New Democracy party leader
Constantine Mitsotakis asked Parliament about the money from the
duties that were not paid.
   Under the law governing the culpability of Cabinet ministers, a
special committee of 12 legislators will investigate the charges
against Athanasopoulos and decide whether the former minister should
stand trial.
   The coalition government has pledged to investigate and punish
those involved in scandals in banking, the arms industry and alleged
phone-tapping by the former socialist administration.

<TEXT>
   Seeking to shock legislators into supporting a tax
increase, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis today outlined $491 million in
cuts in the Massachusetts state budget.
   ``I'm today doing the worst thing I ever had to do in my
political career,'' Dukakis said at a noon news conference, at which
he blamed himself and the Legislature for the state's fiscal mess.
   The package of impounded funds and vetoes cuts into a $12.3
billion state budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.
   The cuts include a freezing of welfare benefits at current
levels, cuts of $16 million in environmental affairs and $17 million
judiciary and district attorney accounts and a reduction in state
scholarship funds. The welfare move means that the state's poor
receiving general relief will get no cost-of-living increase.
   ``All of us in state government have arrived at this unhappy
moment through a combination of miscalculations, mistakes and
misinformation,'' Dukakis said. ``I'm disappointed in myself. I'm
disappointed in the legislature. I'm disappointed in all of us who
have let the talkmasters and the columnists define our values, our
commitment to public service, our commitment to each other.''
   The Dukakis plan includes an across-the-board reduction in
administrative costs by 10 percent.
   ``The first 250 million hits the bone and will cause real pain,''
Dukakis said. ``The balance hits raw nerve and will be devastating
to people, to families and to communities. I'm doing what I'm doing
today because I have to do it to avoid fiscal chaos. I can't let the
state go down the drain financially and I won't.''
   Key pieces of the Dukakis package of state spending reductions
include:
   _Total cuts in public education and higher education of $62
million.
   _A cut in the state human services budget of $97 million.
   _Reduction in the state AIDS program of $2 million.
   _A cut in Aid to Families with Dependent Children of $22 million.
   _$8 million from the state mental health budget.
   The Legislature has already given initial approval to a tax
increase to balance the previous year's budget. Now the issue of a
tax increase for this year looms.
   Using the line-item veto and his power to impound funds, Dukakis
said he also plans to eliminate the office of University of
Massachusetts President David Knapp and cut two-thirds of the 2,100
additional state employees planned for in the budget, leaving prison
guards as one of the few categories to be increased.

   NATO today presented the Warsaw Pact with
new proposals on reducing conventional arms and aircraft in Europe,
two months ahead of schedule in a bid to accelerate a disarmament
agreement.
   The early presentation provided ``further evidence of ... our
desire to achieve early results,'' Michael Edes, the head of the
British delegation speaking on behalf of NATO, told a news
conference.
   Presenting the proposal today instead of in September, as
originally planned, gives the Warsaw Pact time to frame a response
during an eight-week recess in the talks. Negotiations broke today
and resume Sept. 7.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III outlined details of the
NATO proposal Wednesday. He said NATO was recommending a ceiling of
5,700 combat aircraft and 1,900 combat helicopters for each
alliance. The inclusion of an aircraft cutback complied with a
long-standing East bloc demand.
   According to NATO data, the Warsaw Pact countries have about
9,600 combat aircraft versus about 6,700 NATO aircraft.
   The Western proposal is based on a blueprint for deep reductions
in conventional arms and troops in Europe first unveiled by
President Bush at an alliance summit in May and subsequently
endorsed by NATO members.
   Bush called for military cutbacks that would fix the same ceiling
of 275,000 troops in Europe for each superpower. According to NATO
statistics, that would require the United States to remove 30,000
troops from Europe while the Soviets would have to pull out more
than 10 times that, or 325,000.
   The proposal also foresees deep cuts in armaments, with a
proposed ceiling of 20,000 tanks for each side and reductions in
combat aircraft and artillery.
   The decision to make the proposal was reached by a panel of
senior North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials in Brussels on
Friday, a U.S. official in Budapest said.
   It complied with East bloc appeals that the presentation be
speeded up.
   The head of the Soviet delegation, Oleg A. Grinevsky, welcomed
the NATO proposal but said he was ``sorry'' it did not go further.
   ``At first glance the proposal tabled by NATO today has no new
elements,'' Grinevsky, said in a news conference.
   ``Rather it is a more detailed elaboration of the positions that
were stated in Brussels, and only in respect of aviation and
helicopters at that,'' Grinevsky said.
   At a meeting in Bucharest, Romania, last weekend, leaders of the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact praised Bush's NATO proposal and said an
initial accord on reductions could be reached as early as next year.
   However, the East bloc summit did not produce any new concrete
proposals on arms control of its own.
   The Bush proposal called for reaching agreement in six months to
a year, and for reductions to be carried out by 1992 or 1993.
   In a statement issued at the end of the two-day Bucharest summit,
the Warsaw Pact said, ``The situation of the negotiations is such
that the first understandings may be achieved already in 1990.''
   Last week, the head of the Polish delegation to the Vienna talks
called on NATO to submit the proposal before the recess rather than
waiting until the third round of talks opens in the fall.
   The Soviet military bloc has a proposal on the table to reduce
six kinds of weapons 10 percent to 15 percent below present levels
by 1994, then add a further 25 percent reduction by 1997 before
moving to purely defensive forces in the year 2000.
   The Soviet Union has also begun unilateral troop withdrawals from
Eastern Europe that are to reduce the number of Soviet troops in the
region by 50,000 by 1990.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, the
longest-serving incumbent governor in the nation, announced today he
would not seek a fifth term in 1990.
   Near tears and with his voice wavering at times, Thompson told
reporters that his decision was based on family and career reasons.
   ``My wife and daughter said they would support another term, but
I wasn't ready for that,'' Thompson said at a news conference. ``My
family and their happiness and security is the most important thing
to me at this time.''
   He added that he would ``enjoy the challenge of the private
sector.'' Thompson also said he might seek another government office.
   ``That's entirely possible,'' he said. ``I do not intend to
retire from politics _ only from this office.''
   The 53-year-old Thompson, a moderate Republican who has served 12
years, was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate early in
his career and as a vice-presidential candidate last year.
   More recently, speculation has centered on whether Thompson would
leave state government to accept a federal appointment or a
partnership in a Chicago law firm.
   The speculation became increasingly intense over the past few
months, particularly within the Republican Party. Both Secretary of
State Jim Edgar and Lt. Gov. George Ryan are interested in running
for governor, but both have said they would not challenge Thompson.
   Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls have also awaited Thompson's
move as a guide to their own strategies.
   Thompson first burst into the national spotlight during his
four-year tenure as U.S. Attorney in Chicago from 1971-75, when he
sent several prominent allies of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley to
prison on corruption charges.
   Passing up an offer to run against Daley, Thompson instead
claimed the GOP gubernatorial nomination in 1976 and defeated a
Daley-backed Democrat, Michael Howlett, by 1.39 million votes _ the
widest margin in Illinois history.
   His first term lasted only two years because Illinois was in the
process of switching its gubernatorial elections to non-presidential
election years.
   He was re-elected to a four-year term by another record margin in
1978 and then twice turned back challenges by Democrat Adlai
Stevenson III _ in 1982 by the narrowest margin in state history,
and again in 1986 to become the state's only four-term governor.
   Though titular leader of the state GOP and a key backer of Bush,
Thompson has frequently been at odds with his fellow Republicans on
fiscal and social issues. His political reputation is one of a
pragmatic, non-ideological bridge-builder, evidenced by his support
among traditionally Democratic groups such as organized labor and
his warm relations with some conservative Chicago Democrats.
   Thompson's most successful year in office may have been 1985,
when he played a key role in passage of landmark school reform
legislation, won approval of a massive infrastructure renewal
program and landed the much sought-after Diamond-Star auto assembly
plant.
   Those promising achievements gave way to frustration in his
fourth term as his efforts to gain approval of a state income tax
increase were blocked by Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan.
   Earlier this month, he wound up signing a two-year tax increase
drafted by Madigan and approved with mostly Democratic votes over
the objections of Thompson's fellow Republicans. That set the stage
for a potentially bruising battle over renewal of the tax in the
months following the 1990 election.

rainfall in Sichuan province has killed 367 people, the People's
Daily reported Thursday.
   The heaviest casualties were in cities along Jialing River in
eastern Sichuan, the newspaper said.
   Officials say recent rains and flooding have been the most severe
disaster to hit the province _ China's most populous _ in eight
years.
   Heavy flooding also has been reported in coastal Zhejiang and
Fujian provinces, in the southeastern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region and northeastern Qinghai province.
   Deaths have been reported in Jiangxi province, and other
provinces along the Yangtze River have been warned to prepare for
high water.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, buoyed by his landmark visit to
Eastern Europe, joined dozens of world leaders today for a
spectacular Parisian party celebrating the 200th anniversary of the
French Revolution.
   Bush helped kick off the festivities by helping present to France
the historic key to the Bastille fortress, birthplace of a rebellion
against the French crown two centuries ago. The key, in U.S. hands
since 1790, is on temporary loan.
   On his way to the French capital, Bush voiced hope that his tour
of Poland and Hungary had ``given encouragement to those who want to
go the path of reform, political change, economic change'' in those
communist nations.
   The gala events preceding a summit meeting of the world's seven
largest industrial democracies contrasted sharply with the
president's trip to Poland and Hungary, where he promised to help
both communist nations with major economic reforms.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, said
Bush would encourage the summit partners to formulate their own aid
programs for Poland and Hungary. He said the idea was to create sort
of a ``clearinghouse'' to avoid duplication of assistance by the
summit countries: the United States, Britain, France, West Germany,
Japan, Canada and Italy.
   Also, Scowcroft said the United States would consider giving food
and other commodities to Poland if austerity measures add to the
hardships of the Soviet bloc country.
   Bush was greeted by French President Francois Mitterrand at the
inaugural bicentennial event at the Place du Trocadero commemorating
the Declaration of the Rights of Man. That statement, issued in
August 1789, set forth the French Revolution's aims of liberty,
fraternity and equality for all people.
   The world leaders sat on a blue and white grandstand listening to
a young man and woman who took turns reading the 17 articles of the
declaration. A children's choir dressed in white sang a ``song of
joy,'' played games and threw peace laurels, flowers and children's
toys on the esplanade.
   At the end of the ceremony, the leaders burst into applause as a
flock of doves flew over the palace. Then, chatting amiably, they
left for a lunch given by Mitterrand, who sat next to Bush during
the ceremony.
   Security was tight with an estimated 30,000 police, including
rooftop marksmen, guarding the summit events. Police also towed away
about 1,000 vehicles as part of their ban on traffic in the main
thoroughfares.
   Before leaving Budapest for the French capital, Bush told
Hungarian leaders that ``as your economy modernizes, you will play
an even greater role in the evolution of a new Europe, a Europe that
is whole and free.''
   Bush told his Hungarian hosts, ``you are proving, here in the
heartland of Europe, that the Rights of Man are the proper
birthright of us all.''
   In an impromptu news conference on Air Force One during the
flight to Paris, Bush said his East European visit ``has been
watched by the people of other Eastern European countries and
hopefully given encouragement to those who want to go the path of
reform, political change, economic change.''
   Bush also dismissed a Moscow spokesman's statement that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is unable to meet a NATO target date
to reduce conventional military forces. And he said the United
States will not overhaul its Middle East peace policy in response to
political turmoil in Israel.
   He said that in Poland and Hungary, ``the thing that is so
impressive is the determination of all of these leaders to move
towards economic freedom and political freedom.''
   Bush said he had stressed publicly and privately that reforms,
including austerity measures, are essential to building strong
economies.
   ``There is no point going there under false colors and to try to
have everything sweetness and light,'' he said. ``It's a message
that it isn't going to be easy, but that's part of the message.''
   The president said no one expressed disappointment over the
relatively modest aid programs he proposed for Poland and Hungary.
``I think that they understand that we are restricted in what we can
do in terms of dollars ...,'' Bush said.
   In Paris, Mitterrand greeted each leader arriving by limousine at
the ceremony site near the Eiffel Tower. The crowd in the street
cheered when Philippines President Corazon Aquino appeared. Other
guests included Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, President
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and
other African leaders, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, Brazilian President Jose Sarney, Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari and Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti.
   The French festivities features concerts, fireworks and parades.
   After a 40-minute meeting with Mitterrand, Bush took part in
ceremonies marking the return _ actually a brief loan _ of the key
to the Bastille, the site where the French Revolution began when the
fortress was stormed in an uprising against the crown on July 14,
1789.
   Bush planned to present the large iron key to Mitterrand for
display through July 22 at the new Bastille Opera house, adjacent to
the site of the famous fortress.
   The key was given to George Washington nearly 200 years ago by
the Marquis de Lafayette. Since 1797, the key has never left
Washington's estate in northern Virginia.
   Since 1858, the historic artifact has been in the possession of
the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, the private, non-profit
organization that owns and operates Washington's home.
   When the bicentennial party reaches its peak Friday, the Champs
Elysee will be the site of a parade featuring Britons maching under
artificial rain, Russians dancing with a bear on ice and an American
band strutting backward all the way down the famed avenue.
   Amid extraordinary political uncertainty in Poland and Hungary as
they struggle with democratic reforms, Bush devoted the first half
of his 10-day European journey to encouraging advocates of change.
   Aside from strong messages of moral support, he left behind
packages of U.S. aid of $100 million for Poland and $25 million for
Hungary to spur development of private enterprise.
   ``Your challenge is enormous and historic: to build a structure
of political change and decentralized economic enterprise on the
ruins of a failed Stalinist system,'' Bush said in a speech
Wednesday at the Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences.
   Imre Pozgay, one of Hungary's four communist leaders, told Bush
the changes in his country were ``irreversible'' and added the
government would ``accept the results of free elections'' set for
next year and step down if defeated.
   Bush promised he will press for a coordinated plan of further
assistance for Poland and Hungary at the annual economic summit with
leaders of France, Britain, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan.
   The summit meeting begins Friday evening and concludes on Sunday
with the reading of a final communique.
   Aside from aid for Poland and Hungary, major topics are expected
to be environmental problems and Third World debt.

   A truck filled with hot asphalt overturned
onto a woman's car, nearly sealing it with the steaming goo, police
said Thursday.
   Patrons of a restaurant nearby used shovels to clear a space so
the woman could breathe, and she let her rescuers know she was alive
by honking the horn.
   The woman, Pamela Cohen, 26, of Bay Shore, was in stable
condition Thursday at the Nassau County Medical Center with leg
injuries.
   County police said the truck was turning into the restaurant
Wednesday when it toppled, spilling much of the 325-degree asphalt.
Rescuers poured water on the asphalt periodically to cool it down.
Steam injured three firefighters.
   The driver of the truck, Ralph Uliano, 37, of Huntington Station,
was charged with driving while intoxicated.

<HEAD>Norway Wants Treaty With Soviets on Military Accidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norway will propose a bilateral agreement
with the Soviet Union covering warnings on military accidents, a
report said Thursday.
   Norway began drafting the treaty two years ago and made it a high
priority after a recent Soviet navy accidents off northern Norway,
according to the newspaper Klassekampen.
   ``Norway is ready to enter an agreement with the Soviets about
warnings on military incidents,'' acting Foreign Ministry spokesman
Oeyvind Nordsletten told the newspaper. He did not say when the pact
would be presented.
   Oslo complained of Soviet slowness in providing warnings and
details of accidents aboard two Soviet nuclear submarines near
Norwegian territory.
   On April 7, a Soviet submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea. On June
26, another Soviet sub suffered a reactor breakdown off northern
Norway.
   Nordsletten said the draft treaty is similar to those the Soviets
recently signed with the United States, Britain, France and West
Germany.
   The treaty also would require warning when ships or aircraft from
the countries approach each other, he said. There is heavy air and
sea traffic off northern Norway from Soviet miltary bases on the
Kola Peninsula, just across the Norwegian-Soviet border.
   ``One example of an incident that might have been covered was
when a Norwegian Orion surveillance plane was damaged by a Soviet
fighter that flew too close over the Barents Sea in 1987,'' he said.
   Last fall, the two nations agreed to inform each other of
civilian nuclear accidents, such as the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant disaster in 1986.

<HEAD>The Environment, East-West Relations Will Dominate Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The annual economic summit meeting that begins
Friday will be dominated by environmental pollution and East-West
relations because, this year, there's little bad economic news for
the seven participants to discuss.
   President Bush and the leaders of the six other large,
industrialized western democracies will meet through Sunday. Along
the way, they will take time for lavish dinners, fireworks displays
and festive parades organized by French President Francois
Mitterrand to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the French
Revolution.
   Almost as gleaming as the French celebrations has been the
performance of the world's economy.
   In contrast to the gloom-and-doom forecasts following the October
1987 stock market crash, growth in 1988 and through the first half
of this year has been stellar.
   Virtually all the summit nations enjoyed an acceleration of
economic activity last year with total growth for the seven nations
averaging 4.2 percent, the best showing in four years.
   Such a performance clears the way for other topics to take center
stage.
   Bush, attending his first economic summit, hopes to use the
meetings to assume the mantle of leader of the Western alliance on
economic and environmental issues, much as he did on military
matters in May with his troop reduction proposals at the NATO summit
in Brussels, Belgium.
   Bush has said the environment is coming on like a ``freight
train'' as an international issue and leaders of the other summit
nations _ Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada _
are facing growing political pressure to do something as well.
   The president arrived in Paris after unveiling relatively modest
aid proposals for Hungary and Poland during his history-making trip
to the economically troubled nations. He looked to his summit
partners for similar commitments to boost economic and democratic
reforms in Eastern Europe.
   ``I'm going to tell them that there is dynamic change taking
place in Eastern Europe,'' Bush told reporters during the flight to
Paris from Budapest, Hungary.
   The recent turmoil in China will also be a primary topic when the
seven leaders hold their discussions at a modernistic arch on the
outskirts of Paris. But the talks are unlikely to produce any calls
for new sanctions in retaliation for the crackdown on dissent in
China. Most of the Western leaders fear that any further isolation
of the Beijing government might derail economic reforms the country
is undertaking.
   Not that there aren't economic concerns as well.
   Trade imbalances have begun to widen again with the threat that
an unruly rise in the dollar could make America's trading woes even
worse in the coming year.
   Inflation is on the rise, as well, although U.S. leaders insist
that the increase is a blip and not the start of a long-term problem.
   There is also the seemingly intractable problem of the $1.2
trillion debt burden that has depressed growth in the developing
world for over a decade.
   As for environmental concerns, Bush is bringing along
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly to help
explain the administration's new proposals to cut carbon monoxide
and the pollutants that cause acid rain.
   The talks also are expected to cover such topics as depletion of
the ozoe layer, global warming, deforestation and ocean dumping.
   Reilly said he was expecting something of a race between the
summit leaders ``to be the greenest of all on this issue.''
   Bush is also looking to the summit to give a boost to his
administration's Third World debt proposals. On March 10, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady unveiled a strategy emphasizing debt
forgiveness and interest-rate reductions instead of simply adding
new lending to the huge debt burden being carried by developing
countries.
   The administration's desire to present the summit with an early
success story got a boost over the weekend with the announcment that
negotiators for the commercial banks and Mexico were near a bargain
on a debt-reduction package for the Third World's second largest
debtor.
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, one of the dozens of
world leaders in Paris for the bicentennial celebration, said
Thursday that the negotiations were at a critical stage and urged
the summit nations to back the Brady plan.
   The communique that will formally end the summit is expected to
endorse the overall principals of the Brady debt plan and the
Japanese, who already have pledged $4.5 billion to support the
debt-reduction effort, are coming to Paris with an even larger
lending program to help the Third World.
   The United States is likely to be criticized for what the other
participants view as a high-handed approach taken by the Bush
administration to remove trade barriers by threatening stiff
sanctions against nations that fail to remove trade barriers America
finds onerous.
   Bush, in a pre-summit press conference, defended his targeting of
Japan, Brazil and India for possible sanctions if talks on
eliminating barriers do not produce results.
   While the U.S. trade deficit narrowed for the first time in seven
years in 1988, there is concern that the rising dollar, which makes
American products less competitive overseas, will halt the
improvement with the U.S. deficit still at record levels.
   The summit countries, beginning in 1987, have tried to coordinate
their economic policies in such a way as to keep the dollar's value
on foreign currency markets within narrow ranges.
   But earlier this year, despite those efforts, the dollar broke
through the upward boundaries, leading some to question whether the
economic coordination process was in need of a drastic overhaul.
   However, just in recent weeks, the dollar finally fell back
within the accepted ranges, taking the pressure off the summit
leaders to come up with any significant new agreements aimed at
dollar stabilization.
   With the economy now in a record seventh year of peacetime
expansion, Brady said the United States and the other summit
countries are not anxious to embark on broad new initiatives.
   ``Nobody should be mistaken about the fact that we have very,
very good economic conditions around the world,'' he said. ``So
let's not try and fiddle with the controls too much when you've got
that kind of backdrop.''

   Britain's first cosmonaut, due to join a Soviet
mission in 1991, may soar into space in a suit covered with
commercial plugs in the style of a racing driver, an advertising
agent said Thursday.
   More than 11,000 people reportedly have applied for the honor
ahead of Friday's deadline.
   The advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi has been involved in
lining up commercial sponsorship for the trip. Some sponsors may
support scientific projects, others may simply want to be identified
with the flight.
   ``It may well come down to the type of camera the British
astronaut uses of what sort of shoes he, or she, wears,'' said
agency spokesman Bill Jones.``If we are successful, this guy will go
up looking like a racing driver!''
   Britain has to raise $25.6 million by commercial sponsorship,
much of which will go to the total $51.2 million cost.

<HEAD>Group Says US Lacks Comprehensive Controls on Toxic Runoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation needs a comprehensive plan for
controlling poison runoff into waterways from city streets, farms,
mines and other sources, an environmental group said Thursday.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council said some state and local
governments have taken effective measures to reduce the pollution,
but the problem is growing worse in many areas because of inadequate
national standards.
   ``Poison runoff is the leading source of pollution of at least
half of the nation's rivers, lakes and coastal waters, yet this
problem has received a small fraction of government funds and
attention,'' said Bob Adler, director of the group's clean water
project.
   Adler said the runoff, containing poisonous quantities of lead,
zinc, copper, phosphorus and agricultural pesticides and other toxic
substances, poses a ``potentially major'' health hazard for swimmers
and fish and other wildlife.
   This runoff has been more difficult to control than water
pollution from factories and sewage treatment plants because it is
diffuse and is given less federal attention, he said.
   Adler's group announced the publication of a book, based on two
years of study of poison runoff, that provides case studies of ways
to combat the problem.
   Among its conclusions is that farms are the single largest
contributor to the problem because of the use of fertilizers and
pesticides that pollute surfrace and ground water, soil erosion that
carries excess nutrients and soil particles into rivers and streams
and pollution from livestock.
   ``We're going to have to start thinking about regulating
farmers,'' Adler said.
   The book also said logging, mining, grazing, and construction
also contribute to the problem.

   A bomb exploded today outside a
discotheque patronized by American military personnel, wounding
seven U.S. Army soldiers, three of them seriously, officials said.
   The attack occurred shortly after midnight at La Ceiba, more than
200 miles north of Tegucigalpa, U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles V.
Barclay said in a telephone interview. There was no claim of
responsibility.
   It was the fourth attack on U.S. soldiers in Honduras since Feb.
1. Three soldiers were injured in the previous incidents.
   Today's victims were Army military police, who were in La Ceiba
to act as escorts for about 150 American soldiers taking part in a
joint road-building exercise with Honduran troops, Barclay said. He
said the entire group was due to leave La Ceiba today.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said the explosive was thrown as the Americans left a disco. Barclay
could not confirm that.
   ``We don't know if the explosive device was hurled from a passing
automobile or had been detonated in place,'' Barclay said. He said
the device exploded outside a discotheque.
   The injured soldiers were part of a group of nine who had been
given a night's leave and were in civilian clothes. Two uninjured
soldiers fled and were arrested by Honduran troops because they had
no identification, a Honduran military commander said.
   Barclay said three of the wounded soldiers were in serious
condition, while the other four suffered lesser injuries. He said
all were assigned to the Enrique Soto Cano Air Base, 50 miles
northeast of Tegucigalpa, a major center for U.S. troops in Honduras.
   The wounded soldiers were rushed to a private hospital in La
Ceiba, Barclay said. Their names were not released.
   Col. Eric Sanchez said the uninjured Americans were being held
until they could be officially identified by U.S. officials.
   Sanchez, the Honduran military commander at La Ceiba, said the
attack occurred at 12:30 a.m. and involved a ``homemade explosive
device.''
   Barclay said the troops were part of a convoy that had been
building roads in a province 120 miles east of La Ceiba. The convoy
had stopped for the night during its trip back to Soto Cano.
   About 15,000 American troops and Honduran soldiers were taking
part in an exercise called Strong Roads that began in December and
ended Tuesday. The exercise involved bringing in troops from the
United States a few hundred at a time for road-building.
   At least 20 American soldiers have been wounded in attacks in
Honduras since 1982, when the United States started increasing its
military presence in this country and holding joint exercises with
Honduran troops.
   Today's attack came three months after unidentified assailants
used gunfire and an explosive to attack a jeep convoy carrying 11
U.S. and six Honduran soldiers outside Olanchita, near La Ceiba.
   One jeep was disabled in the April 11 attack, but no injuries
were reported.
   A shadowy leftist group calling itself the Morazanista National
Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the attacks earlier this
year and for attacks in 1983 and 1987.
   Since 1982, the United States and Honduras have carried out
around 80 military exercises jointly, involving a total of 100,000
American soldiers, under a 1954 reciprocal military assistance
treaty.
   The exercises were intended partly as a political signal to the
leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua, which borders Honduras
to the south.
   Some elements of the Honduran population strongly resent the
increased U.S. military role in the Central American nation, as well
as the use of Honduran territory by the Contra rebels battling the
leftist government in Managua.
   Honduras was used by the U.S.-supported Contras in their attacks
on Sandinista forces. U.S. military aid to the Contras was cut off
about 17 months ago, and U.S. assistance to the Contras has been
limited to humanitarian aid.
   Thousands of Contras still live in the border area, but fighting
has declined substantially as a result of a cease-fire agreed to in
March 1988.

<HEAD>Foreign Travel Agents Seek Discounts, Chinese Promotion Help</HEAD>

   Foreign travel agents Thursday urged China to end
martial law in Beijing, lower prices and mount a public relations
campaign abroad if it wants to lure back tourists scared by the
crackdown on pro-democracy protests.
   One after another, travel agents told Chinese tour officials
their ideas for salvaging what both sides had expected to be a
lucrative summer season.
   ``We need very practical solutions and we need them very
quickly,'' said Peter Spreadborough of Silk Route Travel in
Melbourn, Australia. ``We may have lost the entire 1989-90 program.
We've invested heavily in promoting China. The return will be zero
for most of us.''
   His suggestion, echoed by many other agents, was for China to
invest in overseas tour promotions, something China does not
normally do.
   ``They want people to come in _ they have to go outside,''
Spreadborough said. ``Our problem is destination credibility. We
know it's safe but until there is some sizeable effort from big guns
in Chinese tourism, we're fighting an uphill battle.''
   Ken Chang of Pacific Delight Tours in Hong Kong, said his company
lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on promotional material for
now-canceled China tours.
   ``We want our Chinese friends to share the risk and the profit,''
he said, calling on China to help fund an advertising campaign.
   Some travel agents said they still planned to bring in groups in
September, although July and August tours were canceled. Patrick Woo
of Amerasia Travel in Washington predicted that if the Chinese get
30 percent of what they had last year, ``they'll be in good shape.''
   More than 4.3 million tourists visited China in 1988 on organized
tours alone, and several times that many are estimated to have come
individually. China reaped $2.2 billion in hard currency in a major
boost to the country's development program.
   But since the army shot its way into Beijing on June 3-4, killing
hundreds and possibly thousands of civilians, tourism has nearly
halted. When 16 foreigners arrived in the eastern province of
Jiangxi on Thursday, local officials gave them a ceremony and
welcomed them as the first foreign visitors in two months, the
official Xinhua News Agency said.
   China decided two weeks ago take emergency action, and invited
about 400 tour agents from Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, the United
States and other countries for a two-day, all-expenses-paid seminar.
   At the conference's end, the director of the Beijing Tourism
Administration, Bo Xicheng, promised that China would give 20
percent discounts to foreign tour groups ``in the near future or at
least before the end of the year,'' Xinhua said.
   Some cities' branch offices of the national tour agency also have
announced price cuts, according to the Toronto-based Travel China
Newsletter. Individual hotels in Beijing have begun charging their
off-season rates.
   However, under an austerity program imposed by the government to
counter inflation and other economic problems, China's state-run
tour organizations may not have the money to conduct the large-scale
promotion the agents demanded.
   Instead, they concentrated on winning over the travel agents.
Tour workers from Beijing and other cities pressed their name cards
and glossy brochures into as many hands as possible, and some gave
out gifts of sandalwood fans and tea.
   The Chinese also handed out political promotional material:
copies of a government report that condemned the student-led
protests and booklets with pictures of soldiers' burned and beaten
bodies.
   For $8, the tour agents could buy a government videotape called
``The True Story of the Turmoil,'' with footage of civilians
attacking soldiers. The video, a compilation of footage shown on
Chinese TV, does not show any violence by soldiers against civilians.
   Some tour agents defended China's action, while others privately
expressed anger and sorrow. But all agreed that China must either
lift martial law or reduce the military presence before large
numbers of tourists will return.
   One suggested putting soldiers on the streets only at night.
Henry Wong of Holi Asia Tours in San Francisco said soldiers should
be told to take their fingers off rifle triggers and ``smoke a
cigarette or drink a Coke in order to ease the tense situation.''
   Added Australia's Spreadborough: ``Australians find it
unacceptable for soldiers to have guns on the street. It makes them
jittery. Australians are used to taking vacations on beaches, and
you don't find men with guns on beaches.''

   A German-speaking man wounded a
policeman in a shootout today, took a woman hostage in her home, and
demanded that authorities bring him heroin and his West German
girlfriend, police said.
   The man, whose name was not known, broke into the house of the
52-year-old woman around 2:30 a.m. after exchanging gunfire with
police and slightly injuring one officer, said police spokesman
Herman Naberhuis.
   A radio report said he is West German.
   The kidnapper demanded a supply of heroin and that his West
German girlfriend be allowed to join him, Naberhuis said.
   Police gave him some heroin and his girlfriend was being
interviewed at police headquarters in this southern Dutch city near
the West German border.
   ``I don't know whether she wants to join him at all,'' Naberhuis
said.
   He said the confrontation began when the man broke into a nearby
house known to police for its connections with heroin trafficking,
he said. A woman living there alerted police who were fired on six
times when they arrived.
   The suspect then fled into another house, where he seized his
hostage.
   Heerlen is known for its relatively large population of Dutch and
West German drug abusers.

<HEAD>Kemp Says HUD Scandal Won't be Used to Cancel Programs</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Inserts new 7th graf, Rep. Bill, with HUD to be ordered not
to use consultants</HEAD>

   A Senate committee voted today to launch its
own investigation of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, as a House panel said it has voted to strip money from
a rehabilitation program at the heart of the burgeoning scandal
involving the agency.
   Although Housing Secretary Jack Kemp has said he would not
sacrifice programs for the poor to cure the problems he inherited, a
House Appropriations subcommittee voted earlier this week to deny
money in the fiscal 1990 budget year for the Moderate Rehabilitation
Program.
   ``It was a program shot full of fraud and abuse,'' subcommittee
chairman Rep. Bob Traxler said today in xplaining the panel's
action. ``It's time we step back and determine what fixes may be
necessary.''
   Traxler, D-Mich., said the decision was neither ``irrevocable''
nor ``permanent'' because the Senate traditionally had allocated
money for the program despite its omission from Reagan
administration budget requests.
   Traxler said the Bush administration, like its predecessor, also
made no provision for funding the Moderate Rehabilitation Program in
its proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   ``I will not predict what the Senate's view of this will be,'' he
said.
   Rep. Bill Green of New York, the ranking Republican on Traxler's
subcommittee, said the panel will direct HUD, in an upcoming report,
to write regulations prohibiting the use of consultants in any
future use of the $200 million in unspent Moderate Rehabilitation
funds.
   The little-noticed vote on Tuesday made the Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation Program the first casualty of the series of internal
HUD investigations and congressional inquiries into widespread
influence-peddling, mismanagement and corruption at the department
during the Reagan years.
   Meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee voted today to begin its
own investigation of the HUD scandals. An investigation already was
under way by a House Government Operations subcommittee.
   The panel will look at ``management and other activities'' in
connection with the Moderate Rehabilitation Program, the use of
government co-insurance and income tax credits between 1978 and 1988.
   The committee also voted to send the nomination of Frank Keating
as HUD's general counsel to the full Senate for confirmation.
   The panel's vote follows two days of intensive questioning of
Kemp by two House panels about the future of several of the agency's
troubled programs.
   Kemp assured worried members of Congress that he acted within his
authority in suspending some programs amid allegations of
influence-peddling and mismanagement.
   Members of the House Banking Committee on Wednesday questioned
Kemp's legal authority to suspend programs and warned him not to use
scandals at his agency to eliminate programs for low- or
middle-income Americans.
   ``I wish to emphasize once again, we are the committee that
authorizes programs, makes the changes in them, or terminates
them,'' said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking
Committee.
   Saying he has suspended rather than terminated programs, Kemp
replied that he will submit a legal analysis supporting his
authority to act.
   Keating said Thursday he was ``confident'' Kemp had authority to
cancel the Title X Land Development Mortgage Insurance program which
was the focus of the panel members' questions.
   Kemp pledged not to allow problems at the housing agency to be
used as a ``subterfuge'' to eliminate programs.
   Meanwhile, the New York Times reported today that auditors have
determined that losses in the department's Federal Housing
Administration will reach $1 billion, twice the previously estimated
figure, largely because of losses in the ``co-insurance'' program.
   Under that program, private insurers assume responsibility for 20
percent of the insurance for the department's mortgages. The
newspaper said the FBI has begun to look into the affairs of DRG
Funding Corp., once the largest co-insurer but now suspended from
the program.
   Kemp has in recent months suspended or revised several federal
housing programs after allegations by HUD's inspector general and
others that they were riddled with abuse, mismanagement,
influence-peddling and favoritism.
   Much of his time since taking over the agency six months ago has
been spent answering questions about possible abuses during the
eight years of the Reagan administration.
   ``I do not want to be known as the secretary who abandoned the
needs that people have,'' Kemp told the House Employment and Housing
Subcommittee on Tuesday.
   ``Your good intentions are not questioned here, but the tools you
use to respond to these scandals must be reviewed by us,'' Gonzalez,
D-Texas, told Kemp at Wednesday's Banking Committee hearing.
   ``We need to know where you are going with the termination of
programs,'' added Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie, R-Ohio.
   Several committee members expressed concern that program
cancellations would harm poor people in their districts.
   ``The national scandal is the tip of the iceberg,'' said Rep.
Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio. ``There are some local scandals.''
   In one such case, 13 people were indicted in Hauppauge, N.Y.,
Wednesday on state charges of fraudulently obtaining funds from a
federally subsidized program that made houses available to poor
families.
   Kemp also pledged to curb the use of consultants on HUD
subsidized projects.
   Several congressmen have introduced legislation to limit the role
and fees of consultants in such projects, and to require full
disclosure of the use of consultants.
   Kemp said he will seek to revoke waivers granted by the Office of
Government Ethics to the post-employment lobbying restriction for 58
senior jobs at HUD in an effort to close the revolving door between
government agencies and private firms that do business with them.
   In April, Kemp suspended 1989 funding for the moderate
rehabilitation program after an inspector general's report said
projects were chosen as the result of influence-peddling and
favoritism for former HUD and other government officials who
received big fees as developers and consultants.

   At age 8, Emma Macchiarini-Mankin not only
conquered the treacherous waters of the Golden Gate but also proved
herself a master of the athletic interview.
   ``I made a deal with the sharks _ I wouldn't eat them if they
wouldn't eat me,'' she said Wednesday after becoming the youngest
person to swim the mile-wide passage where the Pacific Ocean meets
the San Francisco Bay.
   With coach and father Danny Macchiarini at her side, Emma
completed the swim in 68 minutes, braving 60-degree temparatures and
tricky currents and maneuvering around a Navy ship.
   Emma, who took to the pool at 10 months and had her first dip in
the bay at 5, bested the youngest-swimmer record set by 12-year-old
Mike Lynch in 1964.
   The 5-foot, 75-pound athlete admitted having doubts near the end
of the swim, but was more than ready when the press asked the
inevitable, ``Why?''
   ``Because I don't know how to drive a car there,'' she said,
adding, ``I want to be famous and have all the money.''

   When it comes to fighting City Hall, Dr. John
Pittman sure knows how to raise a stink.
   When zoning authorities rejected the heart surgeon's request to
put up low-rise office buildings on his 68-acre property in this
wealthy suburb, Pittman turned the place into a hog farm.
   The unexpected whiff of rural Indiana is anything but welcome
among tenants of the new tinted-glass office buildings in the
neighborhood.
   ``There's an old adage you don't have a pig in a parlor,'' said
F. Richard Rembusch, executive vice president of Browning
Investments and one of many unhappy purveyors of office space.
``There is just a foul odor.''
   Pittman swears he didn't bring in the pigs out of spite. He said
it was the only thing he could do with the property after his
building plans were blocked.
   There are signs the standoff may be easing. Recently, Pittman
sold about 200 of his 300 hogs _ because of declining prices, he
said.
   But Mayor Dorothy Hancock maintained she struck a ``gentlemen's
agreement'' with Pittman to scale back the pig operation ``in the
interest of not making people madder.''

   Hamburg residents turn out to celebrate the
104th anniversary of the ``Birth of the Burger'' Saturday, but
there's a sizzling debate over the true origin of that most American
of meals.
   Seymour, Wis., boosters spurn the Hamburgers' claim that the meat
patty was first served in this Buffalo, N.Y., suburb at the 1885
Erie County Fair by entrepreneurs Francis and Charles Menches.
   Dick Tepp, organizer of a 100th anniversary bash for the burger
in Seymour on Aug. 5, says he can prove the hamburger was first
fried and sold by Charles Naygreen at the Outagamie Country Riding
Fair in Wisconsin in 1889.
   ``We've done a lot of research, and we have factual, hard
evidence _ pictures, newspaper clippings and even a living
descendant,'' Tepp says.
   Violet Gauerke, daughter of ``Hamburger Charlie,'' says her
father was 15 when he got the idea to flatten out meatballs and
stick them between slices of bread to make them easier to eat.
   ``He was known all over the country for it,'' she says.
   Hamburg Mayor Richard Hansen is unimpressed.
   ``We believe that we were the first,'' he says. ``And that's all
that matters.''

   Tropical Storm Barry has swirled to life, packing 40
mph winds but posing no immediate threat to land, the National
Weather Service said today.
   At noon EDT, the center of the storm was near latitude 24.5
north, longtitude 55.5 west, or about 675 miles northeast of the
northern Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles.
   That was precisely the same position the storm held six hours
earlier.
   Satellite pictures indicated Barry became nearly stationary
during the night, forecasters said. Some strengthening was expected
before tonight, but the storm's steering currents have diminished
and its movement was expected to be slow and erratic.
   Barry, which had been moving northwest, turned sharply to the
north Wednesday night and posed no immediate threat to land, said
forecaster Hal Gerrish at the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables.
   The storm formed as a depression earlier this week off west
Africa. It became the Atlantic hurricane season's second named storm
when its maximum sustained winds reached 39 mph Wednesday.
   If winds reach 74 mph, it would become the first hurricane of the
June-November season.
   The season's first named storm was Allison, which caused
widespread flood damage in Texas and Louisiana last month.

   Barbara Bush, taking time out Thursday from the
festive French bicentennial celebration, inaugurated a wing at the
American Hospital with an extemporaneous speech _ an informal touch
recently adopted by the first couple.
   ``I had a long speech here but I learned something from my
husband,'' Mrs. Bush told the audience as she tore up her prepared
remarks. President Bush had done the same in Budapest on Tuesday as
a courtesy to the crowd standing in the rain.
   Mrs. Bush opened the new Florence Gould Pavilion and high-tech
medical center at the hospital, which is located in a posh Parisian
suburb.
   ``This is the most wonderful thing that's ever happened to me,''
she said. ``You've stretched my life a little bit. I'm on a
plaque.'' The plaque, which notes the inauguration, will be hung at
the hospital.
   The American Hospital, which Mrs. Bush toured for 30 minutes,
includes the new C.V. Starr International Center for Medical
Exchange, the first facility in Europe with a communications network
for teaching and diagnostics link directly to the United States.
   Before leaving the podium, Mrs. Bush bent down to shake the hands
of four children, out-patients at the facility, who presented her
with a silver cup and a spiral-notebook style cookbook written by
Americans living in Paris.
   Earlier, Mrs. Bush joined her husband and about 30 world leaders
at a reading of the Declarations of the Rights of Man, the 1789
document that set forth the French Revolution's aims of liberty,
equality and fraternity.
   The Bushes later took part in the presentation of the key to the
Bastille prison. The key, given to George Washington nearly 200
years ago by the Marquis de Lafayette, is on temporary loan to
France for the bicentennial celebration.

   The West made a new proposal Thursday on
reducing conventional arms in Europe, acting two months ahead of
schedule in an attempt to hasten agreement. A Soviet delegate said
it contained nothing new.
   In Moscow, the Kremlin welcomed the effort to speed negotiations
and said a deal might be possible within six months.
   ``We have no intention of delaying this important matter of
reducing the level of military confrontation,'' said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov. He added, however, that it
might be difficult to meet a Bush administration proposal to make
the actual cuts by 1992.
   He said the NATO ideas, in general, ``are viewed by us as serious
and constructive proposals, meeting our own proposals halfway.''
   Negotiators for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization offered
the proposal on the last day of second-round talks on reducing
conventional forces, giving the Warsaw Pact an eight-week recess to
study it.
   This provided ``further evidence of ... our desire to achieve
early results,'' Michael Edes, head of the British delegation, told
a news conference on behalf of the Western alliance.
   Oleg A. Grinevsky, head of the Soviet delegation, said agreement
by 1990 ``seems quite possible ... if all sides are agreeable.''
   He welcomed the NATO plan, but said he was ``sorry'' it did not
go further.
   ``At first glance the proposal tabled by NATO today has no new
elements,'' Grinevsky said. ``Rather, it is a more detailed
elaboration of the positions that were stated in Brussels, and only
in respect of aviation and helicopters at that.''
   The Western suggestion is based on a blueprint for deep
reductions in conventional forces in Europe presented by President
Bush at the NATO summit in May and endorsed by the alliance.
   Including combat aircraft and helicopters met a longstanding
demand of the Warsaw Pact.
   Edes said the West initially opposed including aircraft because
their mobility posed verification problems in a zone stretching from
the Atlantic to the Ural mountains.
   Because of NATO's concession on the point, he said, its
``political will to achieve agreement can't be doubted.''
   Bush's proposal in Brussels would put a ceiling on U.S. and
Soviet troops in the reduction zone of 275,000 each. NATO said that
would mean removal of 30,000 American soldiers and a cut by the
Soviet Union of 325,000.
   It also called for deep cuts in armaments, with equal limits on
tanks, personnel carriers and artillery.
   The proposal submitted Thursday also includes limits on the
number of combat aircraft and helicopters, and provides for
destruction of equipment withdrawn. Edes said destroying the
hardware was a new element and would require detailed verfication
procedures.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III revealed the figures to
journalists Wednesday in Budapest. NATO proposes equal ceilings of
5,700 on combat aircraft and 1,900 on combat helicopters. According
to NATO, the Warsaw Pact has about 9,600 combat aircraft and the
Western alliance about 6,700.
   Edes said the new levels would ``adequately safeguard defensive
needs of either side.''
   Western delegates would not give the precise numbers of various
armaments that would have to be removed from Europe.
   ``Precise figures will emerge in the course of negotiations,''
Edes said. ``The numbers game is not very fruitful at this stage.''
   Accompanying the Western proposal were definitions of types of
NATO aircraft included in the proposal.
   Stephen J. Ledogar, the chief U.S. delegate, said NATO wanted
comparisons on the basis of aircraft capabilities, which he called a
``look alike, count alike'' policy.
   Grinevsky criticized the NATO idea of reducing all combat
aircraft. He said the suggestion that defensive systems be included
was ``totally at odds'' with an agreement that first-stage reduction
cover only offensive armaments.
   Asked about Western concern that defensive aircraft could be
modified for strike capability, he said the Soviet Union would be
``ready to invite inspectors'' and even to have ``permanent
inspector teams to verify that there is no cheating.''
   The Warsaw Pact has a proposal on the table to reduce six kinds
of weapons 10 percent to 15 percent by 1994, with a further 25
percent reduction by 1997 and a move to purely defensive forces
three years later.
   Grinevsky complained about the lack of verification procedures in
the NATO proposal. Western delegates said measures on verification
and related issues remained to be worked out.
   Ledogar said NATO ``will will be working hard ... to have the
full proposal on the table at the next round,'' scheduled to begin
Sept. 7. He called Bush's original one-year timetable for an
agreement ``perfectly realistic.''

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. didn't get favored
treatment from banks that loaned him $1.6 million for his
unsuccessful run for the Democratic presidential nomination, the
Federal Election Commission said Thursday.
   Most of the loans were taken out around the time of a group
Southern primaries in March 1988. The Tennessee senator had pinned
much of his hopes for winning the nomination on those primaries.
   Election commission auditors initially questioned whether some of
the banks making the loans had gotten enough collateral and
assurances of repayment. Four of the banks are in Tennessee, and the
other is in the District of Columbia.
   Gore's campaign argued that the loans had been repaid in full,
which should serve as the ultimate proof of the soundness of the
decision to lend the money.

   The revolutionaries who stormed the hated Bastille
prison on July 14, 1789, found only seven inmates to free, locked up
not for their politics but for fraud, incest and lunacy.
   The structure, built in the 14th century to defend Paris against
English attackers, had earlier held such famous prisoners as Nicolas
Fouquet _ believed to be ``The Man in the Iron Mask,'' _ the poet
Voltaire and the Marquis de Sade.
   By 1784, the Bastille was due to be demolished, but five years
later it was still being used as a prison and as a rest home for 82
retired soldiers.
   On the fateful day of July 14, bread in the bakers' shops of
Paris reached its highest price in a year, and the old fortress
became the target of hungry workers from the adjacent Faubourg St.
Antoine district.
   Some accounts suggest the crowd feared they would be caught
between the heavy naval guns mounted in the Bastille's 75-foot
towers and regiments of the king's cavalry.
   Leaders of the 3,000-strong gathering asked the garrison for
gunpowder and arms. When they were refused, the crowd, reinforced by
the unemployed from Montmartre and with army deserters, attacked,
crying ``The Bastille for us! Troops out!''
   The cannon in the towers had alarmed the attackers, but there
were no cannonballs or shot. The garrison of 32 Swiss Guards had
only an assortment of light rifles. Still, about 170 people were
killed in the action, and 115 wounded on both sides.
   The marquis Bernard de Launey, governor of the Bastille, was
taken away and murdered on the way to City Hall.
   The attackers opened the dungeons to find seven prisoners: Jean
Bechade, Bernard Larouche, Jean La Courrege, and Jean-Antoine
Piyarde, imprisoned for fraud; a Monsieur Tavernier and the Comte de
Whyte de Malleville, both mentally deranged; and the Comtes de
Solages, imprisoned for incest.
   The edifice was then set afire, and the traces of the blaze are
still visible, burned into the walls of a canal that runs through
the fortress' foundations.
   Soon afterward, the Bastille was demolished. Some stones were
sold as souvenirs and others were used in the construction of the
Concorde bridge over the Seine in 1790.
   July 14 was declared France's National Day in 1880, 91 years
after the prison fell.

   Cuban war hero Arnaldo Ochoa and three other
former army officers were executed by firing squad today for
shipping tons of drugs into the United States, the official Cuban
news agency said.
   The executions ended a court-martial and appeal process that
revealed a ring in the army and Interior Ministry engaged in drug
trafficking, black marketeering, smuggling and other crimes.
   The Prensa Latina news agency said the four were executed at dawn
in Cuba. In addition to Ochoa, a former army general, they included
former Col. Antonio de la Guardia Font; former Maj. Armado Padron;
and former Capt. Jorge Martinez.
   They were sentenced to death last week, stripped of their
military ranks and thrown out of the Communist Party.
   Ochoa, 57, fought in the guerrilla war that brought Fidel Castro
to power and was made a Hero of the Revolution, Cuba's highest
honor, for heading Cuba's 50,000-man expedition in Angola and an
earlier one to Ethiopia. Ochoa also headed a mission to Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government.
   The defendants appealed their sentences to the Council of State.
The council's 29 members voted unanimously Sunday to uphold the
death sentences.
   Castro, giving a five-hour summation to the panel, said the four
must face a firing squad to restore faith in the Cuban revolution,
ensure discipline in the armed forces and set an example for others.
   In addition to drug trafficking, they were convicted of treason
and other crimes.
   The court-martial also handed out prison sentences ranging from
10 years to 30 years to 10 other defendants in the case. They were
stripped of rank and decorations and were dishonorably discharged.
   The scandal shook Castro's government, embarrassing him and the
Communist Party. He had for years been denying U.S. accusations his
nation was being used for drug shipments, saying the reports were a
plot to embarrass the revolution.
   But he had to admit the accusations were true. In addition to the
officers put on trial, the transportation and interior ministers
have been sacked, and there have been unconfirmed reports that other
officials were arrested.
   Castro said the drug scandal did immense internal damage, eroded
Cuba's international image and crippled the tourism industry it has
been trying to foster.
   Castro accused the United States of trying to score propaganda
points on the drug trafficking issue. He also said Ochoa had stolen
from Nicaragua and Angola, and he held him responsible for defeats
suffered by Cuban forces supporting the government of Angola against
South Africa-supported guerrillas.
   Instead of sharing information on drug smuggling, Castro said,
the United States engaged in a propaganda campaign to discredit
Cuba, its communist revolution and his younger brother, Defense
Minister Raul Castro.
   In Washington, the State Department Deputy spokesman, Richard
Boucher, said the Bush administration did not have access to all the
evidence in the case and therefore cannot make a judgment about the
executions.
   ``With regard to policy, we, of course, support vigorous
prosecution of alleged drug traffickers whoever they may be,'' he
said.
   As for the possibility of U.S. cooperation with Cuba, as
suggested by Castro, Boucher said the United States is waiting to
see what Cuba will do ``in terms of efforts to combat drug-related
activity that still continues.''
   ``You don't automatically start negotiating cooperation until you
have an indication the other side is really serious. And that's what
we're looking for,'' he said.

<HEAD>Police Hiring Plan Gets OK from Senate Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate panel Thursday approved a $127 million
bill to pay for 700 additional District of Columbia police in an
effort to stem the burgeoning murder rate in the nation's capital.
   The House already has approved the plan for the federal
government to pick up the tab for the extra officers.
   By Thursday, 229 people had been killed in the district this
year, compared with 159 at the same time in 1988. A record 372
people were killed last year.
   Police blame more than 60 percent of the slayings on drugs.
   Before the Governmental Affairs committee approved the five-year
plan, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said he might introduce an amendment
requiring the city to pay for part of the program.
   The city already has agreed to pay about $2 million in recruiting
and training costs.
   However, Levin may drop plans to have the city pay for the
officers if he's convinced the district is also making efforts to
hire police, said Levin aide Linda Gustitus.
   The city is adding 200 officers in the current fiscal year, while
300 more are to be hired in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
   The panel also approved an amendment by Sen. Jon Heinz, R-Pa.,
that requires the city to share routine arrest information and other
police data with the FBI and other federal law enforcement groups.
   Because of a 1968 law establishing a balance of power between the
federal and local police departments, the district is the only
jurisdiction in the nation not to share such information.

<HEAD>Proposed Soviet Law on Emigration Boosts Applications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed liberalization of emigration laws has
nearly quadrupled the number of Soviets seeking to settle in the
United States, a U.S. official said Thursday.
   About 33,000 Soviets moved to the United States in 1988. This
year, Soviets are registering their intent to emigrate at an annual
rate of 120,000, and that could reach a quarter-million by 1990,
said Max Robinson, consul-general at the U.S. Embassy.
   ``The United States has a policy of giving all Soviets who seek
to emigrate to the United States the chance to do so,'' Robinson
said. ``That dates back to a very recent time when we were engaged
in a major human rights struggle with Soviet officials to free up
emigration. They are doing so at rates that we did not expect but
are delighted to see.''
   ``I think that once the new emigration law comes into effect and
a pattern is established, it could double next year and come awfully
close to a quarter million,'' he said.
   That many Soviet emigres could overwhelm the U.S. immigration
system, since 200,000 would approximately equal the number allowed
into the United States from rest of the world, Robinson said.
   ``That creates an imbalance that we are going to take a good hard
look at from a policy perspective,'' said Robinson. ``The policy is
under review Washington,'' by the administration and Congress.
   President Bush has said if the Soviets enact the proposed changes
in their emigration law, he will urge Congress to pass a one-year
waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, thereby reducing the tariffs
on Soviet goods exported to the United States. The law, passed in
1972, was sponsored by the late Sen. Henry Jackson and then-Rep.
Charles Vanik.
   Soviet officials involved in drafting the liberalized emigration
law want it enacted as speedily as possible, said Yuri Reshetov,
head of the Foreign Ministry human rights department.
   ``The draft law ... establishes freedom of entry and departure.
Exit or entry on a permanent or temporary basis will be free,''
Reshetov told a news conference. ``The law is on par with
international practice in this area.''
   The key change will be dropping the requirement that Soviets
seeking to emigrate obtain an invitation from an immediate family
member abroad. Instead, Soviets will need only an invitation from a
friend, relative or commercial enterprise saying the emigre will be
supported, according to U.S. officials familar with drafts of the
law.
   The draft addresses two other often-criticized points in the law,
which deny visas to people who have conducted classified research
and require would-be emigres to secure statements from relatives
that they leave behind no outstanding financial obligations,
Reshetov said.
   Terms of secrecy will expire after five years, and the cases of
so-called ``poor relatives'' will be handled by family courts, he
said.
   Foreign Ministry officials have tried to impress upon members of
the new legislature, the Supreme Soviet, ``the necessity of the
speedy adoption of this law,'' Reshetov said.
   The U.S. consul-general said Soviet citizens were lining up for
visas in anticipation of the new legislation.
   Of the 33,000 Soviet citizens who entered the United States in
1988, said Robinson, 20,000 first went to Rome on Israeli visas and
then on to the United States, and the remainder went directly on
U.S. documents.
   So far in 1989, Soviets are registering with U.S. officials at
the rate of 60,000 a year, and at the same rate at the Dutch
Embassy, which handles consular affairs for the Israeli government.
   In any recent week, he said, 1,200 to 1,500 Soviets registered at
the U.S. Embassy, of whom 40 percent were Armenian, 25 percent
Jewish, 15 percent ethnic Russians, 5 percent to 8 percent
Ukrainians and 5 percent Balts. Others were Azerbaijani, Turkish,
Georgian or Tadzhik or another nationality.
   Of the comparable number that register weekly at the Dutch
Embassy for Israeli visas, he said, about 95 percent are Jewish.

   President Bush said Thursday the United States will
not relax its policy on the Middle East to accommodate political
turmoil in Israel, a nation he said is beset by ``great
difficulties.''
   Bush, talking with reporters on Air Force One as he flew here
from Hungary, said Israel should go forward with elections among
Palestinians in the occupied territories as a step toward peace.
   And he said the United States will not change its policy of
opposing Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. The U.S.
view is that such settlements are obstacles to peace.
   Bush's comments reflected the strain in U.S.-Israeli relations
caused by the July 5 decision by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc to harden its stand on conditions for Middle
East peace negotiations.
   At a press conference in Paris, Brent Scowcroft, the president's
national security adviser, drew a distinction between the decision
of the Likud party and the Israeli government. ``What Likud does is
a party matter and what we deal with is the Israeli government,'' he
said.
   Scowcroft said the purpose of a planned visit to Israel by a U.S.
delegation was ``just to ascertain in the wake of the Likud
conference whether or not there has been a change in Israeli
government policy.''
   Bush said the delegation would not be part of any high-level
diplomacy.
   Amid charges in Israel that the United States is meddling in
Israeli politics, Bush told reporters:
   ``The U.S. policy is set. I am the president of the United
States. Israel is a friend and will remain a friend but I have to
say what our policy is.
   ``I don't think there's great heartburn here but I just want to
continue to articulate what we believe,'' he said.
   Bush said, ``I want to see things go forward in terms of the
peace process over there. And we want to see the election process go
forward.
   ``And if anybody can make a case to me that the recent
deliberations in that (Likud) party will enchance the election
process, then I would say `great.' But I am afraid that other people
are looking at it and saying that what has happened does not enhance
the possiblity of elections.''
   Rejecting suggestings that the United States is rattled by
developments in Israel, Bush said, ``I don't know that the United
States is so shook up but they (Shamir and his allies) know the
United States policy and the United States policy on settlements has
not changed and it is not going to change.
   ``We might as well be frank with our friends because that is what
friendship is about,'' the president said.,
   He said, ``They have great difficultes inside of israel. I
understand that. I understand the political pressures but I can't be
varying U.S. policy everyday to accommodate political change. I am
not going to do that.''

   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd doesn't just slip
quietly into the hospital.
   Twenty rooms of the Cleveland Clinic are being refurbished to
accommodate the 67-year-old monarch, his wives and retinue of 200
when he arrives in a few weeks for a physical and possible knee
surgery, said clinic spokesman Gary Weiland.
   Taste and security are both concerns, the spokesman said
Wednesday.
   The Saudi Embassy in Washington refused to confirm or deny that
the king is headed for the clinic, but Weiland said that Fahd will
come to the hospital during a state visit. The king is scheduled to
meet President Bush on July 27.
   The clinic was picked because of its staff's experience in
orthopedic surgery and because the king's half-brother, Khaled, had
heart surgery there twice, Weiland said. Khaled, who preceded Fahd
as king, died in 1982.

buildings relented Thursday after the British rockers agreed to keep
the volume down.
   Organizers of the weekend concert agreed also to move the
floating stage in the Venice lagoon farther from St. Mark's piazza
than planned, city officials said. The top volume will be cut to 60
decibels from 105 decibels.
   The Jericho scenario was raised by city preservation officials,
who threatened Wednesday to deny permission for the concert.
   The concert Saturday is free, and spectators are expected to

from her childhood in Mesquite.
   The 33-year-old actress and model says she brings 5-year-old
Elizabeth Scarlett Jagger and 3-year-old Leroy Augustine Jagger to
Texas from their home in England five or six times a year.
   Ms. Hall, who has a supporting role in the hit movie ``Batman,''
was in Dallas this week to introduce a line of swimwear she
designed. The children in came along.
   ``It's so nice to be out in wide open spaces with the beautiful
skies, riding horses and having fun,'' Mrs. Hall said. ``In England,
they go to school and they're always confined. ... I also want them
to know part of where I come from. They're part Texan, and I want to
be sure they know it.''
   Mrs. Hall said she was designing a swimsuit in honor of a reunion
tour Jagger and his Rolling Stones bandmates plan in the United

   Kirk Douglas settled his lawsuit Thursday against
Sperry Corp., which dropped him as spokesman two years ago when it
merged with Burroughs Corp. to form Unisys Corp.
   The settlement, for an undisclosed amount, occurred as jury
selection was to begin in federal court. ``I am grateful to go back
to the world of make-believe,'' said Douglas, who was accompanied in
court by his wife, Anne.
   Douglas filed a $1.25 million breach of contract suit two years
ago against Sperry and Unisys, claiming termination of the contract
wrecked his chances of getting a similar job with another big
corporation.
   The star of ``Spartacus'' and 70 other movies wouldn't reveal

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ Alberto Zoppe, who tours the country
with his Zoppe Circus Europa, got his big break when his family
traded him for an elephant.
   Zoppe, a sixth-generation circus performer, was working with his
family circus in Italy in 1947 when the Ringling Brothers Barnum and
Bailey Circus asked him to take his bareback horse-riding act to the
United States.
   His family was struggling after World War II and he didn't want
to leave them shorthanded, so he agreed to leave on one condition _
the American circus had to give his family an elephant.
   ``I knew they had 52 elephants and we didn't have any, so I
didn't want to leave my family without anything,'' the 67-year-old
circus owner said as he prepared for a Friday opening here.
   Forty-two years later, Zoppe, 67, tours with his own family
circus in the United States and Canada.

   Much more than cold hard cash, President Bush left
behind hin in Poland and Hungary the shining symbol of an America
that cares about the people of Eastern Europe as they struggle
through a trial period of transformation from Marxist to market
economies.
   He did it with his earnest presence, by neither overpromising
U.S. support nor encouraging a backlash from the Soviet Union.
   ``We were not there to poke a stick in the eye of Mr.
Gorbachev,'' said the obviously pleased president as he chatted with
reporters Thursday aboard Air Force One on the way to Paris.
   ``Just the opposite,'' he said. His aim was ``to encourage the
very kind of reforms that he (Gorbachev) is championing _ and more
reforms.''
   Reflecting Thursday on the uniformly friendly reception he
received in Hungary and Poland, Bush told reporters on Air Force One:
   ``I think it shores up their desire for change because I think it
shows all of us the genuine affection for the United States that
exists in these countries.''
   Bush's message to the leaders and people of the two countries as
they transit this wrenching period of change was that they have, in
the United States, a new partner to lend a hand.
   Clearly, however, the modest aid packages Bush outlined are not
enough to put either Poland or Hungary in the capitalist column.
   Poland is reeling under 100 percent inflation annually. Running
against global trends, the average life span in the country has
declined to 65 years. Pollution is heavy.
   Hungary, the showcase of socalism, has an inflation rate of at
least 20 percent a year. The poverty line is $52 a month and,
according to research by the Heritage Foundation of Washington, 40
percent of Hungarians fall under it.
   Bush acknowledged on his flight here to a seven-nation economic
summit meeting that the aid packages, including a $100 million
developmment fund for Poland and a $20 million fund for Hungary,
were inadequate to rescue the economies.
   But Bush said that in his ``very frank'' talks with Polish and
Hungarian leaders he found ``they understand we are restricted in
what we can do in terms of dollars _ of aid, or dollars of support
for some very worthy project.''
   Even Lech Walesa, the leader of the Polish union Solidarity,
backed away from his quest for $10 billion in aid.
   As it turned out, Bush said, Walesa told him over lunch in Gdansk
on Tuesday that Solidarity was seeking loans from international
banks amounting to $10 billion _ not direct U.S. help.
   Earlier, a spokesman for the Polish government, Col. Wieslaw
Gornicki, complained that there was ``very little concrete
material'' in what Bush offered. He specifically noted the
president's repeated calls for further sacrificies.
   Two years ago, the Poles refused to kick out the props from a
government support system that makes rent and food staples cheap.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, did
say here on Thursday that the United States would be ready to ease
Poland through an austerity period with food aid and other
commodities.
   Bush also plans to ask the leaders of the other six nations at
this economic summit _ Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and
West Germany to help out _ in what Scowcroft called a
``clearinghouse'' effort to avoid duplicating aid.

   A small plane with a stricken pilot ran out of gas
and crashed into the ocean today after flying hundreds of miles on
autopilot. Astonished rescuers said the man swam toward them and was
pulled alive from the water.
   The pilot, identified as a Washington, D.C., lawyer, was taken by
helicopter to Nassau, the Bahamas, and will be flown by jet to
Florida, the Coast Guard said.
   ``The words you keep hearing are: `You're kidding,''' said Petty
Officer Veronica Cady, a Coast Guard spokeswoman.
   Military pilots and rescuers trained to parachute into the ocean
to save ditched pilots could only watch helplessly as their aircraft
tracked the single-engine plane for nearly four hours while it
slowly ran out of gas. The plane crashed in the Atlantic in the
Bahamas.
   ``With all that time he didn't answer us, no communciation
whatsoever, seen slumped behind the wheel, we assumed he was at the
least unconscious,'' Ms. Cady said. ``For him to survive a crash
like that, it just sent us all into shock. We didn't expect this
story to have a happy ending.''
   Rescuers didn't know how he got out of the plane, she said. There
was no immediate word on the man's condition.
   The Federal Aviation Administration declined to identify the
pilot, but staff members at the Washington law firm of Thomas Root,
36, a communications lawyer, confirmed that he was the man.
   Nothing more was heard from him after he reported to air traffic
controllers in Virginia at 8:30 a.m. that he was having chest pains
and difficulty breathing. He had taken off from Washington's
National Airport at about 6:30 a.m., bound for Rocky Mount, N.C.
   The man was glimpsed, apparently unconscious, at one point as the
plane headed southward roughly parallel to the East Coast. There was
no one else visible in the plane, and radio messages to the plane
went unanswered.
   The Coast Guard said the plane ran out of gas and crashed into
the ocean in the central Bahamas, about 15 miles east of the island
of Eleuthera. The site is about 250 miles southeast of Miami and 800
miles from the pilot's original destination.
   Reports from the planes tailing the Cessna were that ``it
spiraled into the water, so it didn't make the best of all possible
landings,'' Chief Petty Officer Lou Parris said.
   FAA spokesman Jack Barker in Atlanta said that as the plane
headed southward it had gotten as near as 100 miles from the East
Coast shore because of the curvature of the coastline.
   Hans Hess, manager of the Rocky Mount-Wilson, N.C., airport, said
the plane had been due to arrive there at 7:49 a.m. Hess said a
person had been waiting to meet the pilot and the plane. He did not
know if that person was a relative and did not identify the person.
   After its distress call, the plane was intercepted by two Marine
Corps F-A-18 Hornets when it entered Norfolk Naval Station airspace
at 8:45 a.m., said Lt. Cmdr. Mike John, a Navy spokesman.
   The pilots of the intercepting planes tried unsuccessfully to
establish voice contact with the pilot, he said.
   The Cessna 210 Centurion can seat four to six people, counting
the pilot, and cruises at about 190 mph.
   Bill Pierman, shift supervisor in the air traffic control tower
at Washington National, told Raleigh radio station WPTF the plane
``very easily'' could wind up in the Bahamas.
   ``Put an airplane on automatic pilot and it's going to continue
just exactly on the course that the automatic pilot is set for.''
   He said the automatic pilot was set on a heading that would have
sent the plane toward Bahamas, but the pilot would have made a turn
for the Rocky Mount-Wilson Airport.
   The two rescue teams are part of the 301st Aerospace Rescue and
Recovery Squad. The C-130 part of the squad is based at Homestead,
the helicopter part at Patrick, said Lt. Col. Margaret Stanek of
Homestead Air Force Base.
   A flight surgeon was part of the rescue teams as well as the
people trained to parachute in the water, she said.
   Root's staff gathered around a portable radio to hear news that
he had been fished out of the water alive, but Signe Schilperoort, a
paralegal in the office, said they had received no word on the
rescue or on Root's condition from authorities.
   She said Root had no history of medical problems and had been
flying since he was a teen-ager.

   A national group of engineers, urged by a White
House official to take a stand, called Thursday for actions to
combat overheating of the Earth without waiting for absolute proof
it is happening.
   The steps should include efforts to improve the cleanliness of
coal burning, to increase use of nuclear energy and to plant more
trees, according to the report released by Ernest L. Daman,
president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
   While there are still scientific uncertainties about the
``greenhouse effect,'' there is enough evidence to show that the
amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing, said A.
Alan Moghissi, who headed the society's risk analysis task force.
   ``A prudent course of action may consist of assuming that adverse
effects may take place and that corrective actions may be
necessary,'' said Moghissi of the University of Maryland-Baltimore.
   The society released a position paper entitled ``Energy and the
Environment,'' including a wide-ranging series of recommendations
for improving energy efficiency as a means of helping the
environment.
   Daman said the decision to issue a position paper on global
change, a controversial issue in recent years, had generated debate
within the 116,000-member society of mechanical engineers.
   However, he said White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, an
engineer and a member of the society, helped spur the group to
action.
   Daman said that Sununu had told him that if technical groups want
to be listened to they have to stop issuing ``general,
do-good-things'' reports and instead take positions on issues.
   ``We have to do that, I think Sununu is right,'' Daman said.
   Some environmental groups have criticized the Bush administration
for taking what they consider a too-cautious approach to the issue
of global warming.
   Bush officials have said the issue is hardly clear-cut, but a
report last month by the White House advisory Council on
Environmental Quality said the government might find it necessary to
plan ``future projects considering climate change even before all
the uncertainties are known.''
   The engineering society's report deals with the theory that
increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could cause the climate
to warm, melting polar ice caps, disrupting farming and leading to
other major changes in society. Carbon dioxide allows shortwave
radiation from the sun to pass through to the earth but blocks the
long-wave radiation from earth that ordinarily travels out into
space.
   Many scientists believe that this change will result in an
increase in the average temperature of the Earth, although others
say too little is known to reach any conclusions yet.
   The mechanical engineers conclude in their study that research
should be accelerated on the greenhouse effect, including an
international agreement on reforestation.
   The group called for an international fund to help maintain
tropical rain forests, plus a national effort toward planting more
trees across this country. Trees and other plants remove carbon
dioxide from the air.
   Other proposals put forth by the engineers include:
   _Incentives for improving the efficiency of coal-burning plants.
   _Substantial research to develop safer nuclear reactors, based on
currently operating reactors.
   _Development of technology to improve the fuel efficiency of
automobiles.
   _Continued support for the development of renewable energy
systems.
   _Establishment of a central facility for receiving, evaluating
and packing spent nuclear fuel and preparing it for final disposal.
   _A national effort to reprocess and recycle nuclear fuel.
   _Improvement of material requirements and safety of hydrogen
energy.
   _Increased research on acid rain reduction.

<HEAD>Group Says Secret Grant Approval System Unfair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A public group charged Thursday that the
National Science Foundation uses a secret system ``ripe for abuse''
to evaluate grant applications from scientists, and urged the agency
to make the process more open.
   Public Citizen, a non-profit advocacy organization, told NSF
director Erich Bloch that the system violates ``the letter and the
spirit of various federal laws that are designed to make federal
agency decision-making fair and accountable.''
   Eric Glitzenstein, a lawyer for Public Citizen, said at a news
conference that the NSF for 14 years maintained a system of record
keeping that blocked grant applicants from learning what had been
put into their permanent file.
   That meant unfounded allegations about a scientist were kept
secret, even if the information played a role in denying his grant
application, Glitzenstein said.
   ``The scientist cannot learn about the allegation, cannot respond
to it, and has virtually no ability to appeal the denial,'' he said.
``Anytime you have system based on secret reviews, you have a
potential for abuse.''
   The NSF is distributing about $1.8 billion to about 16,000
research projects for the 1989 fiscal year, officials said.
   The petition sent to Bloch also alleges that the NSF has an
inadquate system for dealing with potential conflicts of interest
that may affect approval of an applicants grant. Applicants,
Glitzenstein said, aren't allowed to know who is reviewing their
proposal, which means reviewers could include scientists who compete
with the applicant.
   That system also is ``ripe for abuse,'' Glitzenstein said.
   The NSF changed its filing system last summer to allow future
applicants to have have some access to grant-review records, but
those before 1988 remain closed, he said.
   Lewis Grotke, NSF assistant general counsel, said the agency
would consider the petition but is under no legal obligation to act.
The agency, he said, has tried to develop a fair system to review
grant applications.
   Individual scientists or research teams apply for grants to
finance projects. The NSF distributes the applications to experts in
the field who evaluate the proposals and make recommendations.
   Glitzenstein said Public Citizen became involved after a
University of Texas geologist, Jon Ervin Kalb, learned that two of
his applications in the 1970s had been denied after reviewers
discussed an incorrect and unfounded rumor that Kalb worked for the
Central Intelligence Agency.
   Kalb and the NSF settled a lawsuit on the issue in 1987. The
agency gave Kalb $20,000 in cash, apologized and agreed to correct
its records, Glitzenstein said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a Senate committee drafting a
Puerto Rican plebiscite bill criticized the Bush administration
Thursday for failing to answer questions concerning the economic
impact of proposed statehood or ``enhanced'' commonwealth status.
   Those alternatives to Puerto Rico's commonwealth status will be
on the ballot when the people of Puerto Rico vote in a referendum
scheduled for 1991, and Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., thinks the
voters should know in advance what their choice will entail.
   Johnston, irritated by the absence from Washington of President
Bush's aide handling Puerto Rican affairs, told a U.S. Treasury
official that his request to leave the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee hearing early was an ``insult to this committee
and to the Puerto Rican status issue.''
   Kenneth W. Gideon, assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax
policy, responded that the administration is willing to work with
the Senate committee on the plebiscite. He told the committee, ``The
choice facing the people of Puerto Rico is fundamentally a political
one, with long-term implications for their rights and obligations as
citizens.''
   But this view clashed with that of Johnson, who believes Puerto
Rican voters should know in advance what they should expect in terms
of future U.S. funds for food, health and other basic programs under
any transition afforded under independence or statehood.
   Johnston is asking the administration to spell out in detail the
fiscal impact of major federally funded programs and is seeking
information regarding all 385 federally funded programs on the
island.
   Puerto Rico presently participates in all but 30 U.S.-funded
programs under its present commonwealth status.
   In seeking ``enhanced'' commonwealth status, Gov. Rafael
Hernandez Colon seeks a larger voice for the island in determining
which federal laws should be applicable to the island. The governor
first proposed the holding of a status plebiscite during an
inaugural address earlier this year.
   Johnston, who earlier scored President Bush for remarking on his
personal preference on the island, said he hopes for an evenhanded
approach to all options during the referendum. He said the Bush
administration needs ``a totally new attitude'' regarding the
plebiscite and the present hearings on legislation setting up the
federally supported referendum.

<HEAD>Fahd Calls For Islamic Unity As Pilgrimage Ends</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By ALY MAHMOUD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia called for
Islamic unity Thursday as 1.8 million Moslems ended the annual
pilgrimage to their holiest shrines guarded by anti-terrorism squads
deployed after two bombings.
   Fahd made no mention of the explosions Monday that killed a
Pakistani pilgrim and wounded 16 other people near the Grand Mosque
in Mecca, the birthplace of the prophet Mohammed.
   ``Our prayer is ... that the coming feasts will see the sons of
the Islamic nation in solidarity, united and cooperating for the
good of our causes and efforts to strengthen security, spread peace,
establish justice, and restore rights,'' he said in a message
broadcast by Saudi radio and television.
   As twilight descended around Mecca, the army of pilgrims prayed
before they slit the throats of more than 1 million sheep, cows and
camels for Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice.
   The meat traditionally went to poor Saudis. But since the
discovery of oil virtually eliminated poverty in the kingdom, most
is flown to poor Moslems in 26 countries.
   The faithful then streamed down Mount Arafat to the scorching
Plain of Mina and went on to Mecca for final prayers during the
pilgrimage, or hajj.
   Waves of veiled women and men in white seamless robes, signifying
equality before Allah, took part in the prayers televised live by
satellite to scores of Islamic countries.
   Monday's bombings were the only incidents to mar this year's
pilgrimage, and came amid an intensifying war of words with Iran
over the Saudis limit of 1,000 pilgrims for every 1 million
population in Moslem countries.
   Iran boycotted the pilgrimage, as it did when the limits were
introduced last year and cut its usual contingent of 150,000 by
two-thirds.
   Saudi security authorities have detained an undisclosed number of
suspects in the bombings. The Saudis have not accused any group or
country, although Persian Gulf newspapers pointed to Iran. Iranian
leaders denied involvement and accused Saudi authorities of trying
to discredit them.
   Tehran has used the bombings to strengthen its calls for the
overthrow of Saudi Arabia's royal family, which it accuses of being
anti-Islamic, underscoring the historic rift between the world's 1
billion Moslems.
   Iran's estimated 50 million people are overwhelmingly of the
Shiite sect. Saudi Arabia's 12 million people, like most Moslems,
mainly are from the mainstream Sunni sect.
   The Saudis cited vast renovation and construction projects in
Mecca and other holy sites for reducing the number of pilgrims.
   They severed relations with Tehran in April last year, citing
terrorism and subversion.
   Relations between the two countries, soured by Saudi support of
Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war, worsened during the 1987 hajj when the
Saudis charged Iranian pilgrims started riots that killed more than
400 pilgrims, mostly Iranians.
   The Saudis have spent billions of dollars modernizing the holy
cities and providing all manner of services for what has become a
logistical nightmare.
   Pilgrims once trudged in the sweltering heat on foot or by camel
to make the hajj. Now, they are transported free in 7,500
air-conditioned buses, hundreds of trucks and scores of helicopters.
   The hajj, which must be made at least once by all Moslems who can
afford it, is the world's largest religious congress. It brings
together Arabian princes, merchants from Indonesia, paupers from
Bangladesh and India.
   Each year, Moslems from Soviet Uzbekistan, Poland, Hungary,
Spain, Senegal and other states join in chanting ``God is so great
and to him we pay high tribute.''
   At Mina, each pilgrim throws seven stones at each of the three
``devil pillars,'' a spot where Moslems believe the devil tried to
tempt Abraham to disobey Allah and refuse to sacrifice his son.
   It was 120 degrees Thursday when swarms of hajjis rushed to a
Mina gorge to ``stone the devil.'' Many were hospitalized for
sunstroke.
   During the hajj, pilgrims must abstain from sex and may not
quarrel, cut their hair, or even kill a fly.

<HEAD>Leaders at Summit Bring Different Agendas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of the world's seven largest industrial
democracies are in Paris for the 15th annual economic summit. Here
are sketches of the leaders and their priorities for the summit.
   
   UNITED STATES
   President Bush, 65, is attending his first economic summit. He
arrives with proposals on global pollution, a new strategy for
resolving the Third World debt problem and recommendations to foster
economic and democratic reforms in communist Eastern Europe.
   The administration is hoping that these initiatives will allow
Bush to assume the leadership role in the Western alliance on
economic and environmental matters in much the same way he
established his leadership on military policy at the NATO summit in
May.
   On the environment, Bush will also be seeking international
cooperation in combating depletion of the ozone layer, global
warming, deforestation and ocean dumping.
   On debt, the administration will be pushing the plan unveiled
March 10 by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, which stresses
voluntary forgiveness by commercial banks of a portion of the $1.2
trillion in Third World debt. In return, the banks would receive
guarantees underwritten by international lending agencies that the
remaining debt would be repaid.
   While economic growth in the United States is slowing, most
economists believe the country will be able to avoid a recession
this year. However, there is concern about an uptick in inflation
this year and worries as well that improvement in America's huge
trade deficit may have stalled out.
   Given Bush's extensive international experience, he at least
won't have the handicap that former President Ronald Reagan faced at
his first economic summit. In 1981, the other world leaders viewed
Reagan as something of an oddity, an actor-turned-president with
strange ideas about supply-side economics.
   
   
   BRITAIN
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, 63, is the most senior of the
summiteers, having celebrated her 10th year in office in May. But
she goes to Paris with her Conservative Party government in trouble.
   In June 15 elections for the European Parliament, the
Conservatives were routed by the opposition socialist Labor Party.
It was Mrs. Thatcher's first defeat in a national election since she
won office.
   And for the first time since she won a third consecutive
five-year term in the 1987 general election, Thatcher's personal
approval ratings are behind those of Labor leader Neil Kinnock (34
percent versus 41 percent for Kinnock).
   In Paris, Thatcher expects major debate on the resurgence of
inflation. British inflation has risen from an annual rate of 4.2
percent a year ago to 8.3 percent, double the average for other
European nations.
   The high inflation, accompanied by steep increases in interest
rates, has led to consumer unrest and rising union militancy. There
have been simultaneous one-day strikes by railroad and London subway
workers, mainly over pay.
   
   FRANCE
   Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, 72, ranks No. 2 in
seniority behind Thatcher, having just been re-elected to a second
seven-year term last spring. He is still riding comfortably high in
the opinion polls as his conservative opposition flounders in
divisive squabbles.
   His biggest economic headache is the same one he has had since
first elected in May 1981 _ unemployment, which has been at or above
10 percent for several years. The French trade deficit has also been
rising in recent months.
   Mitterrand's top priority is debt. He has long cast himself as
champion of the downtrodden, debt-ridden Third World.
   In May, Mitterrand unilaterally forgave 16 billion francs ($2.5
billion) in public sector debt to Africa's 35 poorest countries. The
French are looking for other summit countries to match that
generosity.
   On the issue of the debt burden being carried by larger Third
World nations such as Brazil and Mexico, the French want to come up
with a package amalgamating the Brady plan with ideas put forward by
the Japanese and by Mitterrand last September.
   All those plans generally call for forgving a portion of the big
debtor countries' debts in exchange for guarantees that the rest
will be paid.
   
   JAPAN
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, 66, is the newest leader at the
summit and the most besieged. He comes to Paris at a time when his
government is shaken by an influence-peddling scandal and by
allegations that he kept a number of paid mistresses.
   Uno, then foreign minister, succeeded former Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita a little over a month ago when Takeshita resigned
in the wake of the bribery scandal. Now Uno is rumored to be near
resignation because of the sex scandal and his political party is at
its lowest point in 34 years of rule.
   In an effort to shore up his image as an international leader,
Uno will pledge nearly $40 billion in new funds for debt relief and
environmental assistance to developing nations, an impressive
package which should deflect criticism that Japan, now the world's
largest creditor country, has not done enough to relieve the
crushing debt burden faced by the Third World.
   But it remains to be seen whether the new assistance package and
other Japanese initiatives would be enough to defuse Ono's worsening
political position back home.
   
   WEST GERMANY
   Despite a vibrant economy, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 59, head of
government since October 1982, is another summit leader facing major
problems at home. Kohl's ratings in opinion polls have slid
dramatically in the past six months and some observers say he may
not win federal elections slated for December 1990.
   In an effort to bolster his image, Kohl announced a major Cabinet
shakeup in April. At the summit, West Germany is expected to caution
against doing anything that would unleash inflation.
   West Germany, which is expected to post a growth rate of 3.5
percent this year, recently boosted a key interest rate in an effort
to guard against inflation. The move, however, displeased the Bush
administration, which believes the interest rate increase will slow
German consumer demand and dampen the country's appetite for
imported goods including U.S. products.
   It is expected that both Kohl and Bush will press their
respective sides of this dispute during the Paris summit.
   
   ITALY
   Italy is going though one of its recurring government crises. The
coalition led by Premier Ciriaco De Mita, a Christian Democrat,
resigned May 19 and negotiations to form a new government are still
under way.
   De Mita, 61, will represent Italy at the summit in his capacity
as caretaker premier. This has not been an impediment in the past. A
caretaker Italian government hosted the economic summit in Venice in
1987. De Mita has headed up the government since April 1988.
   Italian officials are focusing on three issues at the summit _
cleaning up the environment, fighting the drug epidemic and Third
World debt. On the environment, Italy would like to see standards
established to measure performance by each country.
   According to one forecast, Italy's economy is expected to grow at
a healthy annual rate of 3.5 percent this year and slow only
marginally in 1990. But the upbeat forecast on growth is clouded by
concern over inflation, which has been creeping up to an annual rate
of 7 percent.
   
   CANADA
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, 50, will be looking in
Paris for confirmation that inflation poses a threat on the
international front. His government has insisted that interest rates
remain high to avert the threat of inflation, despite complaints
that they could speed the start of a slowdown or even, in the worst
forecasts, recession.
   The Canadian inflation rate of 5 percent so far this year is the
highest in five years.
   Mulroney is in the first year of his second term and has embarked
on a program intended to eventually bring the government's budget
deficit under control. But other than his austerity message, critics
say his government is adrift in the second term without any major
theme after the big drive to win approval in 1988 for a free trade
agreement with the United States.
   The environment has emerged as a hot topic in Canada, so Mulroney
is interested in pushing the environmental agenda at the summit in
hopes that he can portray himself as a world leader on the issue
back home.

   Rooftop marksmen, airborne television cameras and a
security force of 30,000 protected the leaders of 34 nations
Thursday as they kicked off the bicentennial celebration of the
French Revolution.
   Extra radar installations and even ground-to-air missiles were in
place for the three-day celebration and for the summit of the
world's seven leading industrialized democracies, which begins
Friday.
   ``It's going well, very well,'' said Jean Hanot, chief of police
at the summit site in western Paris. ``Anyhow, you can't be a
pessimist in this business.''
   The guns and guards were focused first on Paris' main boulevards,
where red, white and blue flags flew and noisy motorcades carried
leaders to an array of bicentennial events _ not always to the
pleasure of pedestrians.
   On the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore, the elegant street on which
the Elysee Palace of President Francois Mitterrand is situated,
police shoved Parisians back into their shops as motorcades sped by.
   ``I thought this was our city,'' one resident grumbled.
   Parts of the city were closed to drivers through the weekend.
Although many residents fled the city to avoid the mess, police said
1,000 cars were towed Thursday alone.
   Popular low-lying ``fly boats'' for tourists were forbidden from
plying the Seine River running through Paris.
   A 200-foot-long blimp, which can carry a crew of 10, relayed live
television pictures from two cameras to ground command centers.
   The dirigible, estimated to cost $7 million, was used earlier
this month for surveillance during the visit of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Mirage fighters and Crotale ground-to-air missiles backed up the
blimp, and six radar systems were added to the four normally
installed around Paris to ensure that uninvited guests did not enter
the skies, security officials said.
   At the Arch, the gleaming arch-shaped building where the seven
summiteers will meet, police also planned air protection, said Hanot.
   He said that in addition to 4,000 police in and around the steel
fence ringing the site, 200 sharpshooters were to be stationed on
the rooftops of the jumble of skyscrapers in the area.
   During the summit, traffic will be halted along the five-mile
route from central Paris to the Arch for an hour each in the morning
and the afternoon to allow the foreign leaders to travel, said
police.

   Fellow villagers expected something
terrible of Christian Dornier, but the madness of the strange,
brooding man was worse than they had feared.
   Dornier shot and killed 14 people _ including his mother and
sister, and wounded eight others, including his father, in a
two-hour rampage on Wednesday.
   ``It was a bloodbath,'' Dominique Cuenot of the village council
said Thursday. ``We knew he would create havoc one day and the
police should have dealt with him months ago. Unfortunately, our
laws don't allow such preventive action.''
   ``Everyone here was afraid of Christian Dornier,'' said Joel
Clausse, whose father, Roger, is mayor. ``His behavior was strange.
No one ever complained to the police about him, but we all knew.''
   This farming village in eastern France had 128 residents when
Dornier, 31, picked up his shotgun Wednesday. When his murderous
spree was over, seven of them were dead, including three children.
   He killed seven more from nearby villages and seriously wounded
eight people.
   Joel Clausse saw Dornier driving up in his car Wednesday,
pointing his double-barreled shotgun through the window.
   ``From my upstairs window, I saw he was pointing his gun directly
at my mother, so I aimed my own gun at him and fired,'' Claussee
said. ``I saw the blood spurting from a wound in his neck, but then
he fled and I saw nothing more of him.''
   Joel's mother, Ginettte, said she owes her life to her son. Her
5-year-old niece, Pauline, was killed while playing in the garden.
   Christian Dornier's killings began with his sister, Corinne, 26,
who was married only last Saturday.
   ``There was no argument or quarrel of any kind,'' said Dornier's
younger brother, Serge. ``He picked up his gun and fired it
point-blank at Corinne, killing her instantly. Then in the mad scene
that followed, my mother, Jeanne, telephoned to the police for help.
He fired and killed her, too.''
   Dornier's father, Georges, 63, was one of the eight people
hospitalized with serious wounds.
   Daniel Maillard, Corinne's husband, escaped only because he was
in the toilet, Serge said.
   Then Christian Dornier got in his car, a black Volkswagen, and
set off on his shooting spree. He was seriously wounded when police
caught up with him and opened fire, and was being treated in a
Besancon hospital Thursday under police guard.
   In Paris, an anti-hunting group called for tighter controls on
firearms used by hunters, which are much easier to obtain than
tightly regulated handguns and other weapons.
   The Rally of Opponents to Hunting issued a statement saying
hunting weapons should be taken away from ``from people under
therapeutic medicine,'' and even hunters out of season.
   Serge Dornier works for the Peugeot automobile manufacturing
plant at Montbeliard and, like many young Frenchmen, has little
interest in farming. He said the family had agreed Christian should
ultimately take over the farm from his parents, and it would be sold
if if he could not work it on his own.
   Serge estimated the 148 acres were worth about $60,000.
   ``Christian was a taciturn, depressed fellow,'' Serge said of his
brother. ``He had no friends, hardly ever talked to anyone. A few
weeks ago he suddenly got a punk haircut. He did strange things like
that and we did not pay much attention.''
   People in the village began to talk, including neighbor Remy
Barrand, who said Christian shot at him last month, and a farmer's
wife who said he pelted her with stones early one morning a few
weeks ago.
   The village council discussed what to do and decided no action
was called for because Christian Dornier had never been in trouble
with the law.
   ``We advised the family to get him psychiatric treatment, and
they did,'' said Jacques Fleury, a council member.
   A psychiatrist came regularly from nearby Baume-les-Dames and
prescribed tranquilizers, but Serge said his brother did not take
them.
   ``We thought something happened to him during his 12 months'
military service about eight years ago,'' Serge said. ``He was never
the same after that.''
   Three children playing in their gardens or bicycling were among
those killed from Christian Dornier's car. So were several elderly
people in nearby villages, a farmer driving his tractor in a field,
the schoolteacher at neighboring Autechaux and the wife of the mayor
of nearby Voilans.
   The teacher and mayor's wife arrived at a crossroads, in separate
cars, simultaneously with Dornier. Both were shot to death and their
cars crashed.
   Capt. Rene Sarrazin, police commander at Baume-les Dames, was
struck by bullets in his neck and groin while driving to Luxiol in
response to Mrs. Dornier's call. He was undergoing emergency
treatment Thursday.
   The bodies of the victims were laid out in the various town halls
and were to be buried simultaneously Friday.
   All celebrations of Friday's 200th anniversary of the French
revolution were canceled in the region.

   The leaders of Egypt, India, Venezuela and Senegal
on Thursday urged French President Francois Mitterrand to help
organize a summit meeting as soon as possible between developed and
developing nations.
   Mitterrand endorsed the proposal but said he would not seek a
decision on the issue at a summit meeting of the leaders of seven
major industrialized nations that starts here Friday.
   In a communique issued on the eve of the annual economic summit,
Presidents Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela
and Abdou Diouf of Senegal joined with Indian Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi in saying:
   ``We believe that steps must be taken to organize a summit-level
meeting as soon as possible with a view to discussing global
economic and environmental questions of mutual interest.''
   Mitterrand told the four that he was ``ready to take the steps
necessary to bring about the project,'' said presidential spokesman
Hubert Vedrine.
   But Vedrine said Mitterrand did not intend to ask the other
nations participating in the economic summit _ West Germany, Canada,
Italy, Japan, the United States and Britain _ to decide on the
request for a major conference among the developed and undeveloped
nations.
   ``This is not something for the immediate future,'' Vedrine told
a press conference.
   The four leaders, representing nations in Africa, the Mideast,
South America and Asia, said the proposed conference should mark the
beginning of a consultative process between leaders from the
developed and developing world.
   The call for a summit among the leaders of the developed and
undeveloped nations was the first publicized result of some 20
bilateral meetings as well as informal lunchtime conversations among
the leaders of 34 nations gathered here for the summit and the
bicentennial celebration of the French Revolution.
   During their 15th annual economic summit this weekend, the
participants are expected to address the problem of the $1.2
trillion debt that has stunted the developing world's growth for
more than a decade.
   Both Mitterrand and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady are
expected to push for partial forgiveness of Third World debts in
exchange for guarantees of repayment of the balance.
   Officials said Mubarak discussed the issue with President Bush at
a luncheon at the Elysee Palace for almost three dozen heads of
state and government attending the French Revolution bicentennial
events.
   Gandhi, who sat next to Margaret Thatcher, raised the issue with
the British leader.
   The developing nations' leaders made their pitch for the ear of
the richer nations at a time when the industrialized countries are
steeped in a sense of economic optimism, with the economic woes that
dominated previous summits apparently under control.
   Summit host Mitterrand, to whom the communique was addressed, has
cast himself as a champion of poorer nations and announced in May
that France would forgive debts totalling $2.5 billion owed by 35
African nations.
   In his response to the four leaders, Mitterrand expressed ``his
appreciation of this idea, which is in line with his ongoing action
in view of restarting the ... dialogue'' between the world's rich
and poor nations, his spokesman said.
   The United States, too, announced earlier this month it would
forgive the debt of the poorest nations of sub-Saharan Africa.

<HEAD>Bank May Seek Cut of Jackpot for Ex-Employee's Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bank says it's considering going after a cut of
the $6 million lottery jackpot won by the husband of a former
employee who cheated the bank.
   ``Our attorneys are examining possible options,'' said Beth
Smith, spokeswoman for First Interstate Bank of Denver. ``We're
exploring, in light of her recent good fortune, our options to
recover some of our losses that she caused.''
   The jackpot was won this week by William Romero, whose wife,
Darlene, a former bond trader for the bank, pleaded guilty in
December to federal charges of making false entries in bank ledgers
to make it appear the bank was profiting from her bond trades when
it in fact was losing money.
   Mrs. Romero was placed on five years' probation and ordered to
pay $12,000 restitution.
   The purported profits brought her $66,000 in commissions before
she was fired from her job, which carried a $60,000 annual salary.
   First Interstate says the scheme cost it $3.5 million in 1987.
   It isn't clear if the bank can tap Romero's winnings for his
wife's actions because state lottery rules require the money be paid
directly to the winner, said Marlene Desmond, a lottery spokeswoman.
The couple has declared bankruptcy.
   Mrs. Romero's lawyer, Scott Robinson, said he would oppose any
move to go after the winnings. ``At the time of the sentencing,
that's all the money she had,'' he said. ``They can't take it away
from her now just because she has more.''
   It's the second time a Lotto jackpot has proved a bittersweet
victory since the game was launched six months ago. In April, Albert
Tecci, a public relations and political consultant, and his
girlfriend won a $7 million jackpot. Within days, Massachusetts
tapped him for $24,700 for eight years of child support.

<HEAD>Worker Interviewed by U.S. TV Crew Sentenced to Prison</HEAD>

   China sentenced an office worker to 10 years in
prison Thursday for telling an American television crew that the
military massacred thousands of people in its attack on
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   An intermediate court in the northeast port city of Dalian found
Xiao Bin, 42, guilty of ``spreading counterrevolutionary rumors.''
It deprived him of all political rights for three years.
   The national evening television news showed Xiao, a junior
section chief in a rubber factory, being led by police into the
court to receive the verdict.
   Xiao, in an interview with an ABC television crew, said 20,000
people were killed in the military assault to re-capture Tiananmen
Square from students demonstrating for democratic reforms. In an
emotional statement, he told ABC that military tanks had run over
people and troops had shot to death people wounded by beatings or
gunfire.
   China Central Television apparently intercepted the unedited
video as ABC sent it by satellite to its New York headquarters.
   The state-run television subsequently broadcast the interview and
urged viewers to help find the man. Two women reported him within
hours and he was arrested June 11. The women were commended and
given cash rewards.
   ABC said it was ``deeply distressed'' over the use of its tape
and began covering the faces of students it interviewed.
   China denies anyone was killed on Tiananmen Square. It says about
200 civilians were killed as troops battled rioters who threw stones
and firebombs to stop them from reaching the square.
   Chinese sources and Western diplomats have said up to 3,000 may
have died when troops opened fire on unarmed protesters.
   Earlier Thursday, the Foreign Ministry denied China has become a
diplomatic outcast because of the bloody events at Tiananmen. A
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said most nations support China's tough
measures to eliminate political dissent.
   Spokeswoman Li Jinhua, asked at a weekly briefing how China
reacts to the outpouring of international criticism, said: ``Your
assessment is different from mine.
   ``The fact is that there are only a few countries who are
interfering in China's internal affairs. The majority of countries
have expressed their understanding, sympathy and even support for
us.''
   She repeated China's protests to France for harboring wanted
dissidents Wu'er Kaixi and Yan Jiaqi and said France was guilty of
``flagrant violation of international law and the norms governing
international relations.''
   Most strong criticism has come from the West, although some
communist countries such as Hungary and Yugoslavia also have
deplored the loss of life in the Tiananmen attack.
   The only countries to support China's crackdown have been
hard-line communist states such as North Korea, Romania and East
Germany. Most Third World countries have said only that they have no
wish to interfere in China's internal affairs.
   On Wednesday, Premier Li Peng and new Communist Party chief Jiang
Zemin told a gathering of ambassadors and diplomats they must
``increase their work in explaining the truth to counter rumors of
Western reports.'' Jiang said the diplomats must ``help foreign
friends get rid of their misunderstandings'' of recent events in
China.
   Chinese authorities also tried to present their version of events
Thursday at a seminar with foreign tour agents in which they handed
out copies of a government report that condemned the student-led
protests as counterrevolutionary and carried pictures of soldiers'
burnt and beaten bodies.
   The travel agents, invited to Beijing as China seeks ways to
salvage its nearly defunct tourist industry, agreed that Beijing
must either lift martial law or reduce the military presence before
it can expect foreign tourists to return.
   China earned $2 billion in hard currency from tourism last year.
   Beijing also has lost several major international conventions,
including a meeting of the World Trade Centers Association that was
scheduled for September.
   China's representative Zhang Ming expressed ``great regret''
Thursday over the association's July 5 decision to change the site
of the 23-nation conference to Geneva.
   He said China has been preparing for the annual meeting for a
year and that social order in Beijing has returned to normal and
will be further stabilized, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   ``We will unswervingly carry out the policy of reform and opening
and our trade and economic relations with other countries and
regions will further develop. All foresighted economists and
entrepreneurs can see this,'' Zhang said.

   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Thursday it will add 52 military installations, nuclear fuel
facilities and nuclear laboratories to its list of the nation's
worst hazardous waste sites. It gave no sign how much the required
cleanups will cost.
   ``Many of these facilities are much larger and more complex than
other Superfund sites, with wide varieties of of hazardous and
radioactive wastes,'' EPA administrator William Reilly said in a
news release announcing the additions.
   Because they are federal facilities owned by various agencies,
mostly the Defense and Energy departments, the cleanups mandated by
Superfund legislation will come out of the agency budgets, the EPA
said.
   ``You will see (budget) demands ballooning in future years as
remedies are selected and the cleanup process, the expensive part of
the process, kicks in,'' Jon Cannon, the assistant EPA administrator
in charge of the Superfund said.
   The list includes such facilities as the Feed Materials
Production Center in Fernald, Ohio, the Oak Ridge Reservation in
Tennessee, Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, Savannah
River nuclear military plant in South Carolina and the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory in California.
   The Picatinny Army Arsenal in New Jersey, a 100-year-old
munitions testing and storage depot, is also listed.
   Most of the sites slated for addition to the National Priorities,
or Superfund, list are military installation.
   The 52 sites announced Thursday are in 26 states. California had
the most sites _ 10 _ followed by Alaska and Florida, each with
four. Of the 52 sites, 41 belonged to the Department of Defense,
nine to DOE, one to the Transportation Department and one to the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   All the DOE sites contain both hazardous and radioactive waste,
except the Bonneville Power Administration's Ross Complex in
Vancouver, Wash.
   Those eight DOE sites are Brookhaven, in Upton, N.Y.; Lawrence
Livermore, in Livermore, Calif.; the Fernald center; the Mound Plant
in Miamisburg, Ohio; Savannah River in Aiken, S.C.; Oak Ridge, in
Oak Ridge, Tenn.; Monticello Mill Tailings in Monticello, Utah; and
the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho Falls.
   So far the priorities list has 1,224 hazarous waste sites, 889 of
which are final and 335 are proposed. Federal sites account for 115
of that total, with 41 final and 74 proposed.
   EPA says the list will evenually include more than 200 federal
facilities.
   Once a site is proposed for inclusion, that proposal is open for
public comment, usually about 60 days. The list then becomes final.
   According to EPA officials at a news briefing, the first step
once a site makes the list is a period of study and negotiations
lasting up to two years to determine a cleanup course. Federal law
requires that actual cleanup work begins no more than 15 months
later.
   States and concerned citizens of the states, as well as the EPA,
may intervene to make sure the cleanup proceeds as scheduled.
   The EPA officials noted that the Defense Department had $500
million in cleanup money in its budget proposal for fiscal 1990, but
they refused to comment on whether the funds would be adequate.
   ``We have not engaged in budgeteering relating to these
cleanups,'' said Cannon. Cannon did say there were Government
Accounting Office estimates that the cleanup of DOE facilities would
cost between $80 billion and $115 billion.
   The problem with time and cost estimates, he said, is ``we don't
know what the ultimate remedies are going to be.''
   The EPA says that to speed up the negotiations over the
individual site cleanups it is asking to increase the number of its
specialized Superfund fieldworkers from 34 to 116.

   A choir of children from 15 countries, including
three from the United States, highlighted a theme of international
peace Thursday at the start of celebrations for the bicentennial of
the French revolution.
   The children sang, played games and cast laurels, toys and
flowers before 32 world leaders assembled at Trocadero, across the
Seine from the Eiffel Tower, to honor France's 1789 declaration of
human rights.
   President Francois Mitterrand, seated between President Bush and
Ivory Coast leader Felix Houphouet-Boigny, smiled as the children
ran toward the world leaders and put down the laurels.
   ``We wanted to symbolize peace,'' said Harvey K. Smith, director
of the Phoenix Boys' Choir.
   Smith brought three boys from Phoenix and helped train the
48-member choir, titled ``Little Singers of the World.'' It was
assembled by the United Nations Children's Fund.
   ``The children brought things from their world and shared them
with those here today,'' Smith said.
   The children sang ``Song of Joy,'' a piece of composed for the
celebrations.
   The choir also included three Soviet children, and youths from
Poland, Finland, West Germany, France, Japan, Rwanda, Togo,
Australia, Canada, Mexico, Hungary, Lebanon and the Philippines.
   The children gathered up the toys after the ceremony and then
sang in English the song, ``Nobody Knows The Troubles I've Seen.''

<TEXT>
   One hundred and ninety-nine years ago, the Marquis
de la Fayette gave the key to the Bastille to President George
Washington. On Thursday, the Americans gave it back. Well, for a
week anyway.
   The Bastille was the central Paris prison stormed by the populace
on July 14, 1789. That action became the symbol of the French
Revolution.
   The Bastille later was destroyed. But the marquis, who served as
a general under Washington during the American Revolution, made a
gift of the key as ``a tribute, which I owe as a son to my adopted
father, as an aide de camp to my general, as a missionary of liberty
to its patriarch.''
   The key has hung in the central corridor of Washington's Virginia
home, Mount Vernon, since the end of his presidency.
   The key was presented to President Francois Mitterrand on
nine-day loan by Eugenia Seamans, regent of the Mount Vernon Ladies'
Association, a non-profit organization that has owned and operated
Mount Vernon since 1858.
   The large iron key will be displayed through July 22 at the new
Paris Opera on the Place de la Bastille in central Paris, next to
where the prison once stood, as part of France's bicentennial
celebrations.
   The very brief ceremony was held at the Elysee Palace immediately
after the 40-minute meeting between Mitterrand and President Bush,
here for the bicentennial festivities and to attend the summit of
the seven major industrial democracies.
   As Bush looked on, Mrs. Seaman told the French president it had
hung in the central hall of Mount Vernon since 1797.
   ``Now it's again in Paris,'' she said, handing transparent box
containing the key to a beaming Mitterrand.
   As photographers and cameraman recorded the event, Mitterrand
shook hands with Bush and said: ``I thank the successors of
Washington.''
   The loan of the key was arranged through the American Embassy in
Paris and the U.S. Information Agency.
   By Aug. 1, the famous key is expected to be hanging back in the
hallway of the Mount Vernon mansion.

<HEAD>FCC Gives Smaller FM Stations a Boost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday approved new rules that will allow thousands of FM stations
serving small communities to double their signal strengths and reach
larger audiences.
   The commission, in a 3-0 vote, said so-called Class A FM stations
could boost their power from the present limit of 3,000 watts up to
6,000 watts.
   The commission said the increased power will allow these stations
to provide better service to their listeners without causing
interference problems with other stations.
   The commission also revised the distances by which Class A
stations must be separated from other stations in order to limit
interference. The current separation is about 65 miles (105
kilometers), while the new separation will be about 71 miles (115
kilometers), effective Oct. 2.
   ``The area covered will be 40 percent greater,'' said Jay
Jackson, an official in the FCC's mass media bureau.
   Existing stations that do not meet the revised separation
requirements will be ``grandfathered,'' and will be allowed to
relocate their antennas or request permission to use directional
antennas, Jackson said.
   There are more than 2,000 Class A FM stations nationwide, the
most numerous of the FCC's seven classes of FM stations and those
which have the smallest service areas. The largest FM stations have
signals with 100,000 watts or more.
   The commission said the small communities to which Class A
channels were originally allotted have grown over the years, while
the coverage of these stations has remained unchanged.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick expressed concern about the
commission being hit with a wave of applications from stations that
need permission to boost their signal strength. He said the current
backlog was six months in processing such applications and that it
could increase to 18 months under the crush of new filings.
   He said he hoped Congress will allocate additional funds to the
agency to handle the expected glut.
   ``But we should not forgo good policy decisions because it will
strain bureau resources,'' Patrick added.
   He acknowledged that some FM stations had asked that the rules be
applied in a ``blanket'' fashion, rather than on a selective basis.
Patrick said a blanket approach would have caused too many
interference problems.
   ``We have not granted all the latitude that was requested,'' he
said.
   To allow many stations to increase their power without delay, the
commission said it will publish a list of existing Class A stations
that will be able to boost their signal without interfering with
other stations. It estimated that about 500 stations will be on the
list.
   Licensees who can increase their power with simple technical
changes will be allowed to do so on or after Dec. 1, the commission
said, provided that the changes will not subject workers or
residents to hazardous levels of radio frequency energy radiation.

<HEAD>Botha-Mandela Visit Sows Confusion Among Anti-Apartheid Groups</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid groups, unsure
how to react to talks between President P.W. Botha and black leader
Nelson Mandela, reversed course Thursday and said the meeting was a
positive development.
   ``We do not condemn the meeting at all,'' Mandela's wife, Winnie,
was quoted as saying Thursday by the independent South African Press
Association. ``For us to get to the negotiation table, we have to
start somewhere.''
   Neither Botha nor his heir apparent, National Party leader F.W.
de Klerk, has commented on the July 5 meeting at the presidential
residence in Cape Town.
   Anti-apartheid groups, including Mandela's African National
Congress, initially dismissed the talks as government propaganda
that involved no shift in policy.
   But in a statement Wednesday, Mandela appeared to welcome his
chance to talk with Botha.
   ``I only would like to contribute to the creation of the climate
which would promote peace in South Africa,'' the jailed, 70-year-old
activist said. ``I would also like to confirm that my release is not
an issue at this stage.''
   The statement was Mandela's first since 1985 that was approved by
the government for public release.
   Member of Parliament Helen Suzman, a longtime apartheid foe, had
lunch with Mandela on Thursday but would not disclose anything he
said except, ``He told me he was pleased to have met ... President
Botha.''
   She had not seen him since August, when he was being treated in
hospital for tuberculosis. She said he described his health as good
and he was in very good spirits. ``He keeps fit with the help of an
exercise bicycle and he is visited regularly by his doctor,'' she
said.
   Anti-apartheid leader Frank Chikane appeared with Mrs. Mandela on
Sunday and said the meeting was ``political mischief'' intended to
``sow confusion in the minds of black people.''
   The South African Council of Churches, which Chikane leads, said
Wednesday it was a ``calculated attempt by the government to make
maximum political gain.''
   However, Chikane said Thursday: ``I welcome Mr. Mandela's
commitment to contribute in any way possible to the creation of a
climate which will promote peace in South Africa.''
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Mandela's statement was
``remarkably statesmanlike'' and should dispel the belief among many
South African whites that Mandela is a ``so-called terrorist.''
   ``White South Africa is going to be quite, quite amazed when they
get to hear him speak for himself,'' Tutu said.
   The outlawed African National Congress dismissed the meeting
Monday as a ``public relations exercise.'' It has not commented
publicly on Mandela's statement.
   ``Mandela Wants Peace,'' said the front-page headline in Die
Burger, a pro-government Afrikaans-language newspaper. ``Mandela:
Peace By Dialogue,'' said The Citizen, a pro-government
English-language daily.
   Such headlines were considered unthinkable until recently. Both
newspapers regularly referred to the African National Congress as a
terrorist organization.
   ``There is something Oriental in the way (Mandela) has turned
weakness into power,'' said the anti-apartheid Business Day, the
leading financial daily.
   ``He has achieved much by doing virtually nothing, forcing his
jailers progressively to ease the conditions of his release,'' the
editorial added. ``It is not too much to say that the government is
now the prisoner of its prisoner: it cannot escape his embrace.''
   The government has said Mandela, founder of the congress'
guerrilla wing, must renounce violence before he can be freed. But
Botha this year has suggested those terms may be eased.
   Mandela, serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the government, has said he will not disavow violence
until his organization is legalized and apartheid is dismantled.

   Harvey W. Georges, 71, who covered eight
presidents during a career that spanned 41 years as an Associated
Press photographer, died Thursday.
   Georges, who had been under treatment for cancer, died after a
heart attack at a health care residence in nearby Reston.
   He joined the AP in Washington in August 1941, bent on becoming a
photographer. He reached that goal in 1945, after serving as a
dictationist, copy boy, Wirephoto operator and darkroom technician.
   He photographed presidents from Harry S. Truman to Ronald Reagan,
covered Congress, space shots, demonstrations, political campaigns
and conventions, and along the way became known for his
double-jointed humor as well as his photos. He could stand with one
foot on the floor and one near the ceiling, and sometimes did.
   He made exclusive photographs of the Pennsylvania Avenue scene
after the attempted assassination of Truman in 1950, a shooting in
which one policeman was killed and another wounded.
   One memorable Georges photo was of actress Lauren Becall sitting
atop Truman's piano.
   Georges retired from the AP in 1982.
   He was born on April 19, 1918, in Evansville, Ind., and will be
buried there.

   Consumers are seeing more pork this year and
some easing of prices at meat counters, the Agriculture Department
said Thursday.
   ``Hog producers have experienced a steep drop in returns over the
past year but have made only a modest cutback in hog numbers,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said.
   Commercial output of pork for all of 1989 is estimated at 15.9
billion pounds, up 2 percent from last year and the most since 1980,
the agency reported. Market prices of hogs going to slaughter are
expected to average $40 to $43 per 100 pounds, compared with $43 in
1988.
   The all-cut retail price of pork may be around $1.80 per pound in
1989, down 3 to 5 cents per pound from last year's average, the
report said.

<HEAD>Shooting Reported in Ethnically Troubled Territory</HEAD>

   People are shooting at towns and roads and setting
up roadblocks to disrupt traffic in Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed
territory swept by ethnic violence last year, Tass said Thursday.
   An Armenian motorist was found shot to death on a road leading to
Stepanakert, and ethnic Azerbaijanis ``started a pogrom'' in the
city of Shusha, the official news agency reported.
   Rioters destroyed a store and the airport dispatcher's office in
Stepanakert, the territorial capital, it said.
   The Tass report said roving bands erected barriers on many roads,
and ``bus connections between Stepanakert and other towns have been
interrupted. Automobile traffic into the territory is blockaded.''
   Soviet central authorities have sent a group of ranking police
and internal affairs officials to direct law enforcement in
Nagorno-Karabakh, where ethnic conflict started riots last year that
killed more than 90 people in the neighboring southern republics of
Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   Ethnic Armenians, most of them Christians, make up three-quarters
of Nagorno-Karabakh's population, but the fertile region was
assigned in 1923 to Azerbaijan, a predominantly Moslem republic. It
is about 1,200 miles south of Moscow.
   Tass said Thursday that one man was hospitalized because of the
trouble in Shusha, but also quoted authorities as saying many
injuries were not being reported.
   ``Recent days have been marked by people firing hunting guns on
towns,'' it said. A highway checkpoint in the Askeransky region was
shot at Thursday night, according to Tass, and officers at another
were fired on when they sought to check the documents of a truck
with no license plate.
   Because of the roadblocks, ``bus connections between Stepanakert
and other towns have been interrupted,'' the news agency reported.
``Automobile traffic into the territory is blockaded.''
   In Moscow, Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Timokhin said
Artur Toniyan, the Armenian found dead Wednesday on a road between
two Azerbaijani villages, apparently was the victim of an ethnically
motivated attack.
   Two Azerbaijanis were killed and a third seriously wounded
Tuesday near Kirkidzhan village. There were conflicting reports that
Armenians ambushed the men, that they died in a car accident or
killed each other in a fight.
   A 1 a.m.-5 a.m. curfew is in force in the territory, a
2-month-old strike is keeping most businesses closed and armored
personnel carriers patrol the streets of Stepanakert and other
cities.
   Residents of the capital spoke in telephone interviews of rumors
that Azerbaijanis attacked the ethnic Armenian village of Dashpulag
on Wednesday.
   ``Two buses went there yesterday to help the wounded,'' said
Armen Khachaturyan, who works at the Stepanakert television station.
   Timokhin, the Interior Ministry spokesman, said no reports of
such an attack had reached Moscow.

<TEXT>
   An addict who gave birth to two children
with traces of cocaine in their system was convicted of drug
delivery Thursday under a law routinely used against drug dealers.
   ``A derivative of cocaine which the defendant had introduced into
her body passed into theirs'' through the umbilical cord, Circuit
Judge O.H. Eaton Jr. ruled in the non-jury trial.
   Jennifer Clarise Johnson, 23, faces up to 30 years in prison, but
prosecutor Jeff Deen said he would recommend that she continue in a
drug-treatment program and receive a long period of probation.
   The single mother is believed to be the first person tried in
Florida under the drug-delivery law for transmitting drugs to a
newborn.
   Deen said the verdict is ``a new tool for prosecutors to put a
stop to this great problem in this state and in the nation.''
   A key issue in the case was whether a newborn is a person after
birth but before the umbilical cord is severed. The state made that
argument to justify prosecution under a law making it a felony to
deliver drugs to minors.
   The judge agreed.
   ``I am convinced and find that a child who is born but whose
umbilical cord has not been severed is a `person' within the intent
and meaning'' of Florida law, the judge said. He also ruled that the
term ``delivery'' includes passage of cocaine through the umbilical
cord after birth, Eaton said.
   Ms. Johnson refused to comment. Defense attorney Jim Sweeting
said he would appeal, noting the judge invited review by appellate
courts and the Legislature.
   Sweeting said the ruling was a signal to pregnant addicts to
avoid prenatal care and to give birth to their babies outside of a
hospital. ``I think what we found today is that having a baby's a
crime for pregnant addicts,'' he said.
   But judge said he believed the opposite to be true _ that
pregnant addicts are being put on notice that they have a
responsibility to seek treatment.
   Ms. Johnson gave birth to a boy in 1987 and a girl in January.
Her aunt and mother care for the children, who are seemingly
healthy. Ms. Johnson lives at a drug treatment center in Apopka.
   Sweeting had argued that the law was being bent to punish his
client belatedly for her drug addiction and that the drug-delivery
law was not meant for mothers, fetuses or newborns.
   ``This is a social policy issue,'' Sweeting told Eaton. ``Let's
leave those issues to those elected to resolve them'' in the Florida
Legislature.
   Arguing that a mother and child ``did not constitute two separate
people at birth,'' Sweeting said Ms. Johnson ``did not physically
deliver cocaine'' to her children. If it happened, he said, ``it was
done by osmosis.''

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Medicaid Expansion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee on Thursday approved
expansions in the Medicaid health-care program for the poor that
would cost the federal government about $4 billion over five years.
   The expansions would bring into the federal-state program many of
the pregnant women, infants and children who are not now covered and
have no private health insurance.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee also unanimously approved
a non-binding resolution calling for the Medicare program covering
catastrophic illnesses to be made voluntary, saying Congress cannot
ignore the outrage among the elderly over the program.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the panel's health
subcommittee, said, ``I think we need to make some changes in the
catastrophic care program because so many people are upset.''
   ``I don't believe there's any other issue I've had people talk to
me about,'' said Rep. Carlos Moorhead, R-Calif.
   Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., who proposed the resolution,
called the program a ``catastrophic catastrophe,'' under which many
elderly citizens are being forced to pay for coverage they already
have through their former employers and other sources.
   The measures were approved 30-13 as part of a huge
deficit-cutting package for fiscal year 1990, which begins Oct. 1.
The package now moves to the House Budget Committee.
   The Medicaid expansions would add about $183 million to the
projected $38 billion cost of the program in the next fiscal year.
   One change would require states to phase in over five years
coverage of pregnant women and infants with incomes of up to 185
percent of the federal poverty level. The requirement would begin at
130 percent of poverty by April 1990, which is what the Bush
administration has proposed, but would rise to 185 percent by July
1, 1993.
   A similar expansion has been proposed in the Senate.
   The committee shot down an attempt by Rep. Sonny Callahan,
R-Ala., to protect states like his own where the median income is
low and a large proportion of residents live below the federal
poverty line. He said that under the proposed expansion, more than
half of Alabama's newborn children would become eligible for
Medicaid at a prohibitive cost to the state, which shares in the
cost of the program.
   Another expansion would phase in coverage of children in families
with incomes below the federal poverty level, beginning July 1,
1990, with children born after Sept. 30, 1983. As long as these
children remained poor, they would be covered by Medicaid.
   The committee also approved a change in the way physicians are
paid under the Medicare program, replacing the current fee schedule
with a new one based on such things as the skill, training and time
required to perform a service. The fee structure is intended to
correct inequities in the current system that reimburses specialists
like surgeons and ophthalmologists at higher rates than general
practitioners and internists whose services are mainly ``cognitive.''
   The House Ways and Means Committee has approved a similar plan,
but included another change that would set an annual target for
Medicare spending on physicians. Under the target, physician
reimbursement rates could be lowered to recoup overspending of the
target.
   The different versions are expected to be worked out in a
conference committee later.

   Congress opened hearings on the Supreme Court's
flag-burning decision Thursday, with one lawmaker foreseeing
violence if the decision isn't overturned and another decrying
``shameful and crass demagoguery'' by those trying to amend the
Constitution.
   ``We have to take action, otherwise people will be burning flags
throughout the country on every holiday occasion,'' said Rep. G.V.
``Sonny'' Montgomery.
   ``If we don't do something, I fear Americans, and especially
veterans' groups, are going to stop the desecration of the flag in
their own way and people are going to get hurt,'' he said.
   Montgomery is co-sponsor with House GOP Leader Bob Michel of an
amendment endorsed by President Bush to overcome last month's 5-4
decision by the court. The justices said burning the flag was a
constitutionally protected form of political dissent.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, a liberal Democrat from Ohio, took strong
issue with those supporting a constitutional amendment.
   ``No amendment in our history has restricted individual
freedom,'' he said. ``This is not the time to break faith with two
centuries of tradition.''
   Metzenbaum said the court ruling had triggered ``a crude form of
political one-upmanship, a crass competition about who loves the
flag more ... shameful and crass demagoguery, all with a cold eye
toward the next election.''
   Many politicians have been scrambling to embrace the flag issue
since the court's ruling.
   Bush quickly called for a constitutional amendment to overturn
the ruling, but leading congressional Democrats have been pushing
instead for a law that would address the issue without altering the
Constitution.
   The argument played out Thursday at a hearing by the House
Constitutional Law Subcommittee, the opening shot in Congress over
what is sure to be an extended debate.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, urged the House panel to approve legislation like his own
bill, which could take effect almost immediately. A constitutional
amendment would require approval by the states after Congress acted.
   But supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment said they
doubted anything short of that would succeed.
   ``We believe there is no quick legislative fix,'' said Michel.
   Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs
Committee, said the subcommittee should swiftly approve the
amendment instead of tinkering with legal nuance which might still
offend the court.
   But subcommittee chairman Don Edwards, D-Calif., urged his
colleagues to be cautious.
   ``The flag is sturdy, flying proudly through every fierce battle
of every war and through times of social upheaval,'' he said. ``The
Constitution, however, is fragile and can be amended by the votes of
legislators caught up in the emotional whirlwinds of the moment.''
   Edwards told reporters after the hearing that he believed more
lawmakers were becoming leery of a constitutional amendment.
Opponents of an amendment hope that by swiftly passing legislation
on flag burning, perhaps by the August recess, they can further cool
the fervor for an amendment.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he and other
lawmakers were finding their constituents were opposed to flag
burning but also concerned about a constitutional amendment.
   ``I find it encouraging, because it seems to me that people are
calmly looking at the question of whether the Constitution should be
amended, and I am glad that it is being examined with that calm,''
Foley said.
   Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, ranking Republican on the
subcommittee, said he would fight attempts in Congress to
``obfuscate the issues with legal mumble-jumble.'' Lawmakers should
respond to the will of the people, he said, distributing a Milwaukee
Journal article with a poll saying 75 percent of those surveyed in
his state favor an amendment.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said the issue might be more
complicated than it appears at first glance.
   She held up for the television cameras various uses of the flag
which might or might not be construed a desecration. She included a
picture of herself wrapped in the flag which appeared on the cover
of Ms. Magazine, and one of Barbara Bush wearing a flag around her
neck.
   ``I really wonder how we know which of these are desecrations and
which aren't,'' she said.

   Millions chanting ``Death to America!''
and beating themselves in grief surrounded the gold-domed tomb of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Thursday to end 40 days of mourning
for the founder of the Islamic republic.
   His successor as Iran's religious leader, President Ali Khamenei,
appeared in public for the first time since Khomeini's June 6
funeral and delivered a tirade against the ``terrorists'' of the
United States and its allies.
   The speeches by Khamenei and other Iranian leaders turned the
religious ceremony into an rally against the United States, Israel
and Saudi Arabia.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, seen as Khamenei's
successor, was cheered when he appeared on a podium some distance
from the grave, accompanied by bodyguards carrying automatic rifles.
   Khomeini's son, Ahmad, and Khomeini's elder brother, Ayatollah
Morteza Pasandideh, were also hailed by the crowd when they appeared
on the podium.
   Ahmad, 43, flanked by his weeping uncle, said Iran should stand
firm ``against plots in the region against us,'' an apparent
reference to Saudi Arabia's curb on Iranians from making the annual
pilgrimage to Mecca that climaxed Thursday.
   As the representative of Khomeini's family, he declared the
mourning period over.
   Iranian media monitored in Cyprus said ``millions'' of people
rhythmically thumping their chests and heads in a ritualized frenzy
of grief packed an area 1{ miles deep around the shrine in the
Behesht-e Zahra cemetery outside Tehran.
   There was no independent estimate of the crowd, but aerial views
shown on Iranian television indicated it was as big as the gathering
at Khomeini's funeral, which authorities estimated was attended by
10 million people.
   Khomeini died June 3 at the age of 86, 10 years after his Islamic
revolution toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   Iranian TV showed swarms of wailing mourners pressing around
Khomeini's shrine, which is considered sacred. They believed
Khomeini's blessing and protection would be bestowed on anyone who
touches the temporary square monument that has been constructed over
Khomeini's grave.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said 10,000 people
collapsed with ``heart problems'' or were injured in the suffocating
throng. Another 10,000 were overcome by the 110-degree temperatures,
IRNA said.
   The live broadcast from the cemetery 10 miles south of the
capital showed those who had collapsed being handed by other
mourners over the heads of the crowd to first aid teams waiting on
the fringes. Iranian media reported many were in serious condition
even after treatment at 50 medical stations set up along roads
leading to the cemetery.
   Firefighters sprayed water on the people to cool them down as
loudspeakers blared readings from the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   Many traveled from across the country before Thursday's
ceremonies to keep an all-night vigil around the shrine, IRNA
reported.
   Only low-ranking officials from a few countries attended
Thursday's ceremonies. Major world leaders also shunned Khomeini's
funeral.
   Khamenei denied Iran was behind the bombings in Mecca on Monday
that killed one person and wounded 16 during the pilgrimage.
   ``If exporting the revolution means exporting explosives, and
creating havoc among other nations, then this accusation is far from
the hands of the Islamic republic,'' he said.
   ``Exporting mischief and corruption belongs to America and ...
other aggressive governments,'' he declared.
   ``The hands of the America and its underlings ... are stained
with the blood of innocents. They are the terrorists. The Islamic
republic is absolved of these allegations.''
   Thursday's scene was similar to the mass outpouring of grief at
Khomeini's funeral, when at least eight people died and 11,000 were
injured as frenzied crowds struggled to catch a glimpse of his
shrouded body.
   But this time the authorities were better prepared and
organization was more evident, with medical tents, a fleet of 600
buses, centers for lost children and enough food for 10 million.
   This time, mourners were also covered against death and injury by
a special government insurance scheme.
   Iran's state-run insurance companies announced that the
equivalent of $13,500 will be paid to the family of anyone killed or
seriously injured in the service. Medical expenses of up to $2,000
also will be paid.
   IRNA said 7,000 workers toiled since the funeral to erect the
monument over the grave and levelled a a 43-acre area around it to
accomodate the hundreds of thousands who gather there every day.

   If President Bush lays down a major new
challenge for American space exploration next week NASA won't be
ready, the new head of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said Thursday.
   ``Today's NASA can't do it,'' said Richard H. Truly in his first
news conference as NASA's administrator.
   ``We have been through several years of very marginal funding,''
he said. ``We have a lot on our plate and to take on new challenges
would require buttressing the facilities and the people to do the
job.''
   The National Space Society has urged Bush to announce a national
goal of establishing a settlement on the moon in his speech July 20
commemorating the first landing on the moon 20 years ago, just as
President John F. Kennedy established a moon landing target nearly
30 years earlier.
   ``Any new goal in whatever year is going to require adequate
resources to do it,'' said Truly. ``Given the adequate resources, I
think NASA is very strong and I think that we have a NASA that can
be built upon to take on major new challenges. But I'll tell you
this: Today's NASA can't do it.''
   Truly denied a published report that the National Space Council,
of which he is a member, has decided to make a formal recommendation
for such a major effort when Bush returns from Europe next week.
   Earlier Thursday, however, Vice President Dan Quayle briefed
about a dozen congressmen about ``a major new initiative'' the
council is considering.
   ``They basically outlined three options,'' said Rep. Robert
Walker, R-Pa., the ranking Republican member of the House Space
Science Subcommittee. ``One, for the United States to move ahead
with a robotic program and gradually phase men out of the space
program; another to go back to the moon ... and then going from
there to Mars, and third, to take us directly to Mars after the turn
of the century.''
   Walker said the council was trying to decide among the three
options before making a recommendation to Bush.
   He said the preferred option, as it was outlined to the
congressmen, ``is the mission that would take us back to the moon,
establish a permanent base some time after the first of the century
and to Mars within the first decade.''
   ``It will require doubling the size of NASA and the NASA
budget,'' Walker said.
   The space agency has asked for $13 billion in the next fiscal
year.
   Truly said a new government ethics law that goes into effect on
Sunday along with a pay cap on senior executives has cost his agency
several top managers and has created ``a very disturbing situation.''
   ``I think this ethics legislation has caused us to lose an
inordinate number compared to the average,'' he said.
   ``There are people who have left who could have given us three or
four more years of service and that's a crying shame,'' he said.
   He spoke a day after Richard O. Aller, head of NASA's Office of
Space Operations, quit suddenly _ the ninth high-level agency
resignation this year. Aller was the third to say publicly he is
leaving because of the ethics law.
   ``We know of a few others who are making their final decisions
today and tomorrow literally,'' Truly said.
   ``It's not so much the number, but the quality and experience of
these people,'' he said. ``When 10 senior service executive people
leave you, they take with them 250 to 300 years of government
leadership and experience when they walk out the door.''
   Truly said it is ``an unhealthy situation'' to have a public
service that people can't afford to work for. ``That's not a good
situation,'' he said, ``and it's one we need to deal with.''

   The rescue team aboard the HC-130 Hercules that
participated in Thursday's dramatic water rescue of a stricken pilot
is composed of Air Force reservists trained to ``bring 'em back
alive,'' a spokesman said.
   ``We're called weekend warriors, and we're really not,'' said Air
Force Lt. Col. Robert Dubiel.
   Dubiel, interviewed by telephone from the Air Force Reserve
Headquarters in Robins, Ga., said the rescuers came from the 301st
Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squad, based at Homestead Air Force
Base on Florida's east coast.
   The Florida unit, composed of 235 reservists, is one of three
such rescue teams based around the country. The others are based
near Detroit, Mich., and near Portland, Ore., he said.
   The three squads have racked up more than 400 military and
civilian saves, or rescues, over the past 10 years, Dubiel said.
   ``They've been trained to bring 'em back alive,'' he said.
   ``We do all kinds of things _ we search for lost hikers on
mountaintops. We provide standby rescue support for the space
launches,'' Dubiel said. From the Florida base, the crews ``are
regularly called to assist the Coast Guard in the Atlantic and the
Caribbean,'' he said.
   The parachutists are specially trained to dive into the ocean to
make their rescues. And not only do the resuers have to be trained
medically to assist victims in distress, ``they have to know how to
pull them from the water, pluck them off a mountian if they have
to,'' Dubiel said. ``They have to be in super condition.''
   The job of the Air Force Reserve _ composed of some 82,000 people
_ is to augment the Air Force in crises and in peacetime and provide
backup and ``daily support'' to the military force, Dubiel said.
   A certain percentage of the reservists are on duty full time.
   Dubiel said they tend to bristle at the idea that they are called
to duty only part-time or on the weekends.
   Of the six crewmen aboard the HC-130 and the four parachutists
who dove into the water, only the co-pilot is a part-time reservist,
Dubiel said.
   The HC-130 is a four-engine turboprop plane that has been
outfitted specifically for search and rescue missions. It can also
refuel helicopters in flight.
   On Thursday, six crewmen and four parachutists aboard the plane
participated in the rescue, and all were from Florida, Dubiel said.

   The Coast Guard has released a Taiwanese
fishing vessel held in Midway Island after Taiwan agreed to
prosecute its captain and crewmembers on charges of illegal driftnet
fishing and trying to bribe U.S. personnel, a State Department
official said Thursday.
   ``We have assurances from the president and prime minister (of
Tawian) that both counts will be prosecutued to the maximum extent
possible under their laws,'' said Ed Wolfe, the department's
ambassador for oceans and fisheries.
   The Ta Chieh No. 3 left for Taiwan on Saturday after being
detained at Midway for several weeks while the State Department and
Taiwanese Foreign Ministry worked out details of its release and the
prosecution.
   A Coast Guard party, suspecting illegal fishing, boarded the Ta
Chieh No. 3 with permission on July 6, and was offered gold, money,
alcohol and sexual favors in return for ignoring the violations.
   When the bribes were turned down, Coast Guard officials said, the
vessel's captain ordered the boarding party to leave.
   U.S. personnel were allowed to reboard the ship two days later
and found a ship's log that indicated the vessel had been fishing in
prohibited waters for at least three years.
   The Midgett then escorted the Ta Chieh to Midway while the two
nation's negotiated over its release and the prosecution of the
captain and crew.
   State Department officials had previsouly said the incident
helped prompt the Taiwanese to the negotiating table and eventually
led to a tentative monitoring and enforcement agreement for North
Pacific driftnet fishing.
   The agreement will allow U.S. officials to board Tawianese
vessels suspected of illegal fishing on the high seas and will
require that all Taiwanese driftnet vessels be equipped with
satellite transponders in 1990.

   The FBI has arrested three members of the
Provisional Irish Republican Army and accused them of developing
devices to set off for remote-controlled bombs to be used against
British targets, the agency announced Thursday.
   Richard Clark Johnson, 41, of Nashua, N.H., and Harwich, Mass.,
Martin Peter Quigley, 27, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who
has been living since April in Bethlehem, Pa., and Christina Leigh
Reid, 25, of Sunnyvale, Calif., were arrested Wednesday by agents in
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and California, the FBI said.
   The three face federal charges of conspiracy to injure and
destroy the property of a foreign government, specifically Britain,
the FBI said.
   Details on bail and the current status of the three were not
immediately available, said FBI spokesman Mickey Drake.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions said in a statement that the
three had backgrounds in electrical engineering and were developing
highly sophisticated circuits to be used in remote-controlled
explosive devices.
   The arrests, Sessions said, ``demonstrate the high level of
technical sophistication being employed by terrorist organizations
to further violence worldwide.''
   The FBI will continue its investigation into the organization to
try to identify other operatives of the Provisional Irish Republican
Army, the PIRA, in the United States, he said.
   A federal magistrate in Boston has issued an arrest warrant for
Peter Eamonn Macguire, an Irish citizen national living in Ireland
who is linked to the organization's explosive research program, the
FBI said.
   Drake said he had no additional information on those arrested or
Macguire.
   In affidavits filed Wednesday in U.S. District Courts in
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and California in support of search
warrants, the FBI detailed the PIRA's efforts to obtain devices
known as tone frequency switches, which are electronic encoders that
allow radio commands to detonate explosives.
   The affidavits recounted a 1982 seizure in Newark, N.J., of a
quantity of the switches destined for the PIRA.
   Since then, the FBI said, British and Irish authorities have
recovered at least six switches in unexploded PIRA bombs in Northern
Ireland.
   It was the 1982 seizure which ultimately led to the FBI's
interest in Johnson, the FBI said. Sessions said cooperation among
the FBI and British and Irish authorities led to the arrests.

<HEAD>Scientists Try New Tactics in Fly War</HEAD>

   Old-style swat teams haven't worked, so
Agriculture Department scientists are trying new tactics to curb
flies where the nation's farms meet the cities.
   ``We've seen instances all over the country where urban
encroachment in agricultural areas has caused problems for
homeowners and agricultural producers,'' said Ralph A. Bram of the
department's Agricultural Research Service.
   Cities are sprawling into the countryside at an estimated rate of
900,000 to 1.5 million acres a year, he said Thursday in an agency
report. And to the newcomers, flies and barnyard odors aren't part
of their idyllic country dream.
   Some flies can travel great distances from manure piles or other
barnyard breeding places to find targets. The stable fly can migrate
up to 135 miles.
   Bram is the national program leader for insects affecting humans
at the agency's research facility in Beltsville, Md.
   ``We have to learn how to increase non-chemical fly control and
how to make the save chemicals we have work better,'' he said. ``It
goes beyond relying on screen doors, sprays and swatters.''
   Possible tactics include non-chemical baits in traps to lure
flies; natural predators such as wasps that prey on flies while in
their pupa stage of development; and natural organisms such as fungi
and bacteria that attack flies in cattle feedlots.
   The USDA attack is directed at four main kinds of flies:
   _Stable flies, which have biting mouth parts and feed on blood.
   _House flies, which secrete digestive enzymes onto their food,
then suck up both enzymes and food.
   _Horn flies, which bother only livestock on pastures and
rangeland.
   _Face flies, also pests of livestock, but an annoyance to
homeowners in the fall.
   Stable flies and house flies from farms are the major problem
species for homeowners, said Gustave D. Thomas, an entomologist and
research leader at the agency's Midwest Livestock Insects Research
laboratory, Lincoln, Neb.
   ``In the United States, the stable fly is estimated to cost $400
million annually in damage to cattle,'' he said.
   ``It's hard to put a dollar value on the damage caused by the
house fly. But worldwide, this fly may rank in the top 10 insect
problems because it can transmit a lot of diseases.''

<HEAD>Siberian Coal Miners End Strike After Gov't Agrees to Better Conditions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 12,000 striking Siberian coal miners agreed
Thursday to return to work after the government agreed to provide
better work and living conditions, mine officials and strikers said.
   The two-day strike began Tuesday at all five mines in
Mezhdurechensk, prompting Communist Party and Coal Ministry
officials to rush to the western Siberian town of 107,000 to settle
the dispute, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said.
   Strikers said Thursday they were satisfied with government
concessions that included better night-shift pay, said Victor
Ivanov, a member of the government commission negotiating with the
strikers.
   Strikes are becoming more common in the Soviet Union, where they
once were considered a Western phenomenon brought on by capitalist
exploitation of workers. Strikes used to be brutally repressed and
hushed up, but this year miners' strikes have generally ended within
days with government concessions.
   Night-shift workers at the Shevyakov mine began the strike
Monday, and it spread Tuesday to about 12,000 workers citywide,
Pravda said.
   The newspaper described the strikers' demands sympathetically,
including calls for round-the-clock cafeteria service, meat and
sausage for underground workers, free soap, one free towel per month
and a quilted jacket in winter.
   The strikers' 30 demands included economic independence for the
mines, extended vacations for underground workers and improved food
and housing, the labor daily Trud reported.
   Calls for greater financial independence of individual mines and
for increased night-shift pay were among those immediately granted,
said Alexander Kolmagorov, a worker at the Shevyakov mine.
   Requests for better food supplies and housing will take more
time, Kolmagorov said by telephone from the mine's strike
headquarters.
   ``People are back at work,'' Ivanov said. ``All their demands are
legal and are being decided. Most of them are satisfied, but some
will take time.''
   Trud said the demands resulted from long years of neglect by
authorities interested only in coal production and not in the
miners' needs.
   Mezhdurechensk, about 1,600 miles southwest of Moscow, produces
30 million tons of high-quality coal per year, Trud said.
   In a bitter letter Trud published in January, Mezhdurechensk
miners complained that 10,000 families are waiting for apartments;
hospitals and clinics are as crowded ``as anthills,'' with patients
waiting a week or more to see a doctor; and schools are overcrowded.
   The situation was aggravated when the ministry recently took away
two housing complexes from miners to accommodate other workers, Trud
said.
   A top Soviet official said in May that new legislation is being
drafted that will give unions the legal right to strike.
   Similar strikes were reported in March and April in the Urals
Mountain city of Vorkuta and the Siberian city of Norilsk but both
ended without incident.

   Former Premier Andreas Papandreou on
Thursday married the woman with whom he once had a secret
relationship that contributed to his ouster in last month's
elections.
   Papandreou, 70, wed Dimitra Liani, a 35-year-old former airline
stewardess, were wed in the evening in this northern Athens suburb.
   The wedding was put off twice because of Papandreou's ill health.
He was released from an Athens hospital on July 6 after two weeks of
treatment for pneumonia and a kidney ailment. Nine months earlier,
he underwent open heart surgery in London.
   His relationship with Ms. Liani became public at that time, when
he was seen at the hospital holding hands with her. He was married
then to the former Margaret Chant, but he divorced his American-born
wife of 38 years several days before the June 18 elections.
   His Panhellenic Socialist Movement was swept from office in that
vote amid controversy over his personal life and a series of
financial scandals. Conservative and communist opponents allied to
form an interim government.
   Parliament, which is now controlled by that alliance, on voted
Thursday to investigate a former official in Papandreou's
administration who is accused in one of the scandals.
   Nikos Athanasopoulos, former deputy finance minister, is accused
of arranging for a shipment of 9,000 tons of Yugoslav corn to be
issued with Greek certificates of origin in 1986 and sold to a
member state of the European Economic Community by a Greek state
company.
   The European Court ruled against Greece in May this year, citing
lost revenues of $2 million that should have been paid on corn
imported from a non-member country.
   A special committee of 12 Greek legislators will investigate the
charges against Athanasopoulos and decide whether the former
minister should stand trial in Greece.
   Athanasopoulos, who was not re-elected, has denied involvement in
the scandal.
   The coalition government has pledged to investigate and punish
those involved in scandals in banking, the arms industry, and
alleged phone-tapping by the Papandreou administration.
   About 50 people attended Papandreou's Greek Orthodox ceremony at
the church of Panagia Eleftherotria. They included ranking members
of his party, Ms. Liani's relatives and journalists.
   Papandreou looked drawn but dapper in a dark suit and silver tie.
Upon arriving in a chauffeur-driven car, he waved at hundreds of
supporters who had gathered at the entrance chanting ``Long live our
Andreas!''
   Minutes later, he walked into the church with Ms. Liani, who was
wearing a white strapless gown and a veil of white lace.
   The couple did not kiss as the priest declared them man and wife.
But as they drove off, Papandreou obligingly leaned over for
photographers and kissed Ms. Liani on the lips.
   Papandreou's four adult children did not attend.
   Ms. Liani divorced her husband, Alexis Kapopoulos, a
Revolutionary Greek Communist Party member, earlier this year after
her relationship with Papandreou became public.
   She said in a radio interview last month that her relationship
with Papandreou had been going on for three years.

   Trumpeter Al Hirt, who played at New Orleans
Saints football games during their early years, was honored by the
Saints Hall of Fame Thursday.
   ``I have Grammies and gold records, but this means more,'' Hirt
said of the Fleur De Lis Award the museum gave him. ``I've been a
fan forever. I love this team.''
   Hirt played at Saints games during the late 1960s, the early
years of the franchise, and said he was their biggest cheerleader.
   ``We used to play right behind the bench and I'd lead the fans in
cheering `Go Saints Go.' Sometimes I'd forget to shut the microphone
off and lead them in something I wasn't supposed to,'' Hirt said.
``Pete Rozelle finally called the team and said `get that guy off
the field.'''
   Hirt, 66, no longer plays at games, but says he still attends.
   ``I never miss a game unless I'm out of town,'' he said. ``This
is the greatest team ever.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Outlines $491 Million In Cuts; Says Tax Hike Unlikely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis cut nearly half a billion
dollars from the state budget Thursday in a move he said was made
necessary by ``miscalculations, mistakes and misinformation.''
   He said the needy would be hurt the most, and he renewed his call
for a tax increase.
   The spending cuts in the $12.3 billion budget include a $210
million reduction in aid to cities and towns, a freeze in welfare
benefits and a $62 million cut in public and higher education
spending.
   Dukakis, whose state's budget problems have called into question
the ``Massachusetts Miracle'' he touted during his Democratic run
for the presidency, had argued for six months for tax increases to
avoid such cuts.
   The House has given initial approval to a $744 million tax
increase, but that is a temporary, two-year hike that only pays
leftover bills from the fiscal year that ended June 30. The cuts
made by Dukakis are for the new fiscal year.
   The state constitution effectively requires a balanced budget.
   ``All of us in state government have arrived at this unhappy
moment through a combination of miscalculations, mistakes and
misinformation,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I'm disappointed in myself for not being more effective and
persuasive. I'm disappointed in the Legislature's failure to send me
a balanced budget. I'm disappointed in all of us who have let the
talkmasters and the columnists define our values, our commitment to
public service, our commitment to each other.''
   The mood was somber as Dukakis outlined the cuts before about 700
state employees, lobbyists and others who packed a Statehouse
auditorium.
   ``This state is bankrupt and somebody better realize it,''
Worcester Mayor Jordan Levy said afterward. ``The Democratic Party
is going to be finished business in Massachusetts.''
   Dukakis insisted the Legislature's budget understated expenses by
about $351 million and overestimated revenue by $140 million. He
used his line-item veto authority and his power to withhold funding
to cut the budget.
   Targets of cuts include human services; aid for the mentally ill;
environmental programs, and the state AIDS program.
   Of the $491 million in vetoes and ``conditional cuts'' that would
be restored if money becomes available, the $210 million local and
school aid reduction is most likely to generate controversy.
Communities depend on the state for about 40 percent of their
revenue for everything from schools to police and fire protection.
   Barbara Anderson, head of Citizens for Limited Taxation, said of
higher taxes: ``It isn't going to happen. There aren't going to be
any more taxes than they've already done.''

<HEAD>Scientology Case Sent to National Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $2.3 million fraud and tax evasion case
against the Church of Scientology International has been sent to a
national court after a district judge ruled it was too big for his
jurisdiction, court sources said Thursday.
   Scientology President Heber Jentzsch and 10 others arrested in a
police raid on a Madrid hotel in November remain free on bail
pending formal charging in connection with the case.
   Jentzsch, now in the United States, must report to court
officials July 18, the sources said.
   In a 41-page court order issued Wednesday, Madrid 21st District
Court Judge Jose Maria Vazquez Honrubia said his nine-month
investigation showed that Scientology officials in Spain had
violated 13 laws.
   The Spanish Justice Ministry twice has denied the church status
as a religious entity.
   The accusations included massive fraud, document forgery,
operating without a license, illicit association and several public
health violations.
   Several church-related organizations, including the drug
rehabilitation program Narconon, were named in the court order,
which Vazquez Honrubia remanded to the investigative division of the
national court.
   The national court must now decide whether to accept the case. If
it refuses, the Supreme Court will decide which court has
jurisdiction.
   A lawyer for three of the accused said he was pleased the case
would be in the hands of another, ``less obsessed judge.''
   ``The accusations reflect religious prejudice and are closer to
science fiction than penal reality,'' said the lawyer, Luis
Rodriguez Ramos.
   Lawyers for Jentzsch and the others have filed several complaints
of bias against Vazquez Honrubia, who drew national attention for
his handling of the case after the Nov. 20, 1988 arrests.
   Vazquez Honrubia said the investigation was ``far from complete.''
   Police arrested 71 people in the raid, 60 of whom were released
by the judge after questioning. Jentzsch and the others spent 20
days in jail before Vazquez Honrubia agreed to free them Dec. 10 on
a combined bail of $1.1 million.
   The court document described the Church of Scientology and its
sister organizations as making up ``a multinational dedicated to
sales of goods and services, courses and classes.''
   The judge said the organizations promise ``mental and physical
health based on totally unscientific theories in order to obtain
growing sums of money from captive (adherents).''
   The order said the organizations defrauded Spanish tax
authorities of the equivalent of $1.71 million between 1985 and 1988.
   It also said investigators received complaints against the groups
from 95 people in 10 Spanish provinces alleging personal and
material damages totaling $632,000.
   At the time of the arrests, Vazquez Honrubia blocked church bank
accounts holding $900,000.
   The Church of Scientology, founded in the 1950s by American
science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard, is based on Hubbard's 1949
book, ``Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health.''

<HEAD>Foreign Secretary Meets With PLO Official</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's foreign secretary met with a Palestine
Liberation Organization official Thursday and urged the PLO to
follow a moderate line despite ``disappointing'' moves in Israel,
the Foreign Office reported.
   It said Sir Geoffrey Howe's 10-minute meeting with Bassam Abu
Sharif was the first between a British Cabinet officer and a senior
PLO official.
   Sharif told reporters afterward it was a ``very important
political meeting, especially at this delicate moment in the Middle
East, due to the decisions taken by the Likud party giving a blow to
peace efforts.''
   Last week, the right-wing Likud bloc of Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir set new Israeli conditions for elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. They are expected to make
Palestinian acceptance of the elections less likely.
   Israel's deputy foreign minister, Benyamin Netanyahu, said in a
television interview the Howe-Sharif meeting was ``a setback not
only for genuine peace in the Middle East, but ... for British
policy against terrorism.''
   Despite the its public renunciation of terrorism and recognition
of Israel's right to exist, he said, the PLO supports terrorist
activity and openly declares in the Middle East that it plans to
destroy the Jewish state.
   The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had ``strongly
protested'' to Howe.
   Sharif was invited last week to confer with Minister of State
William Waldegrave, whom he last met in May. After 35 minutes with
Waldegrave, he was taken to see Howe.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said the purpose was for Howe ``to
encourage the PLO to stick to its moderate policy despite the
disappointing outcome of the Likud meeting and the rising tide of
violence in the occupied territories.''
   More than 550 Palestinians and 35 Israelis have been killed
during a 19-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank
and Gaza.
   Likud's new conditions for elections, which would choose
Palestinians to negotiate peace with Israel, demand that the
uprising end before they are held and specify that Palestinians in
Arab east Jerusalem cannot participate.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former aide to Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, Gwendolyn King, will soon be nominated by the White
House as head of the Social Security Administration, a source close
to the situation said Thursday.
   A news release announcing the nomination has been sent by the
White House to Paris, where President Bush flew Thursday for a
summit meeting, according to a source familiar with the release. The
source spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   If nominated by Bush and confirmed by the Senate, King would take
over an agency criticized by organized labor and by congressional
Democrats for cutting back from 80,000 to 65,000 employees during
the Reagan administration.
   She would also face questions of whether to continue to invest
the mounting Social Security surplus into government securities, or
channel funds into financially pressed domestic programs.
   Reached Thursday at the government relations firm of Gogol &amp;
Associates, where she is executive vice president, King said it
would be premature to comment. When told in April she was being
considered for the post, she told The Associated Press, ``I will be
pleased to serve wherever the president needs me.''
   Dorcas Hardy resigned as commissioner last month after lobbying
to keep her job in the face of congressional criticism and
indications that Bush wanted to replace her. She had worked for
Reagan on welfare issues when he was governor of California, and was
a health and human services assistant secretary before being named
to run Social Security in 1986.
   King, a former legislative aide to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., also
headed the Washington office of Thornburgh when he was Pennsylvania
governor.

   Communist Party officials who lack the gumption to
respond to the passionate demands and complaints of Soviet citizens
should quit, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in a speech
reported Thursday.
   Gorbachev offered that blunt opinion to Leningrad Communist Party
leaders Wednesday just before they sacked their local party chief,
Yuri F. Solovyov, a candidate member of the ruling Politburo.
   ``Passions are boiling on the streets, but in many party
organizations there is silence,'' Gorbachev said in his speech,
which was released by the official news agency Tass Thursday. ``It
is necessary to quickly blast out this silence, this dangerous
silence!
   ``It is necessary to face life, to go into life. Whoever doesn't
have the strength, whoever cannot find his place, let him leave,''
Gorbachev said. ``Before anything else, we must think of the party,
of perestroika, of socialism.''
   Perestroika, or restructuring, is Gorbachev's campaign to
overhaul Soviet society and the economy.
   Although Gorbachev never mentioned Solovyov by name, he was
clearly referring to him. When Soviet election law was reformed to
allow multiple candidates, Solovyov and other Leningrad leaders
engineered their parliamentary races to run unopposed. Then they
suffered humiliating defeats when angry citizens crossed their names
off ballots, denying them the required 50 percent approval.
   Solovyov also ignored calls for his resignation and the issues
raised during the election campaign, which brought thousands of
Leningraders into the streets for public meetings.
   In his speech, Gorbachev charged that the Leningrad regional
party committee failed to pay attention to the roots of people's
complaints, in particular their demand for practical results from
perestroika.
   The party, he indicated, must defend itself through its actions.
   As an example, he cited local authorities for failing to improve
a particular factory's working conditions. He said the conditions
were like those facing laborers in the time of Peter the Great, who
founded Leningrad in 1703.
   ``They've been talking about ventilation for two years, and they
cannot put it right. The dust is terrible, the conditions
unbearable. It's shameful!
   ``Well, comrades, for this, you need billions?'' Gorbachev asked
rhetorically.
   ``So people look at this and say, `Perestroika has been going on
for four years, and nothing has changed. This is where we get
irritation, indignation and criticism,'' he said. ``Where is their
(official) union? Where is their party organization?''
   Local authorities often blame Moscow for failing to solve purely
local problems ``which the central government doesn't handle, and
shouldn't handle,'' he said.
   Gorbachev also told his audience not to fear new ideas _ a
failing he had previously found in Solovyov. In April, Gorbachev
reprimanded the Leningrad party chief for complaining that the party
was becoming ``a discussion club.''
   The current period of change, Gorbachev said Wednesday, brings
forth diverse opinions, ``which many people perceive as a threat to
what we have achieved, as a threat to perestroika. Comrades, we must
preserve our strength of spirit, our tolerance, our realism in
evaluating the progress of perestroika, in predictions for the
future.''

   The House Ways and Means Committee voted
Thursday to speed up elimination of the tax deduction for interest
on consumer loans in order to keep a tax break for bankers and
corporate executives.
   The quicker loss of the interest deduction will affect about 24
million couples and individuals. The other part of the bargain is
expected to benefit a few dozen people, committee aides said.
   The panel, working on a broad package of tax changes, rejected an
effort to delay the new surtax that older Americans pay for
catastrophic health insurance. That change would have been financed,
in turn, by cutting the tax on capital gains.
   That combination of changes, proposed by Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, was defeated on a 25-11 vote. All Democrats and Republican
Reps. William Gradison of Ohio and Ray McGrath of New York opposed
it.
   However, committee aides said the panel appears ready to make
some significant change in the financing of catastrophic insurance,
since many older Americans have been vocal in their opposition to
the present law. Aides also indicated there still is considerable
sentiment among members to make some reduction in the capital-gains
tax, even though chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., has ruled out a
reduction on the grounds that his Democratic troops won't support it.
   The committee completed action on the assembly of $5.3 billion
worth of deficit-reduction revenue increases that it is under orders
from the Budget Committee to produce for the budget years that
begins Oct. 1. However, work will continue next week on a variety of
other tax proposals, including catastrophic medical insurance,
capital gains and child care.
   By a voice vote, the panel overturned a decision taken 24 hours
earlier and eliminated from the package an increase in taxes on
snuff and pipe and chewing tobacco. The three products would have
been taxed at $2.67 a pound; snuff now is taxed at 24 cents; pipe
tobacco at 45 cents and chewing tobacco at 8 cents.
   In place of those increases, the committee voted to speed up
collection of taxes from dividends received from mutual funds.
Instead of being liable for taxes on the date a dividend is
received, a shareowner would have to pay from the time the dividend
is declared.
   The biggest single revenue-raiser, affecting corporations that
use employee stock-ownership plans to avoid takeover and banks that
lend to them, was scaled back. It was to finance part of that
retreat that the committee agreed to a quicker end to deductions for
interest on consumer loans.
   Under the 1986 tax reform legislation, those deductions have been
reduced year by year on their way to complete elimination. This year
only 20 percent of interest paid on loans for automobiles, education
and credit cards is deductible.
   That had been scheduled to drop next year to 10 percent. Under
the committee's action, the interest deduction would die at the end
of this year.
   The committee wants to reduce two existing tax benefits connected
with ESOPs, under which workers are given shares of the companies
where they are employed.
   Under the committee's action Thursday, a banker that lends to an
ESOP will be allowed to continue avoiding tax on half the interest
earned from such loans only if the ESOP owns 30 percent or more of
the corporation. The same 30 percent test would be applied before a
corporation could take a tax deduction for certain dividends paid on
ESOP stock.
   A second change would make the new rule effective on July 10 _
more than a month later than the committee originally had agreed to.
This change would allow dozens of corporations that are in the
processing of setting up ESOPs to qualify for treatment under the
old rules.
   Most of the provisions in the committee's deficit-reduction plan
are technical changes that generally affect only corporations.

<HEAD>US Negotiator Predicts Soviets Will Agree on Nuclear Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets eventually will accept an accord on
defense against nuclear weapons if the United States insists,
America's chief Star Wars negotiator said Thursday.
   ``A separate defensive space treaty, in fact, could meet the
stated needs of both sides and could be completed on its own merits,
at its own pace,'' said Henry Cooper.
   ``We have arrived in our discussions with the Soviets over the
past several years at a basic formulation ... for such an
agreement.''
   The Soviets have said the Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly
known as Star Wars, is holding up agreement to limit
intercontinental missiles.
   Cooper, speaking at the Center for Peace and Freedom, said the
Soviets are worried the United States may make important technical
advances and want to be sure it doesn't pull out of a treaty that
prohibits additional defenses.
   ``If we maintain a robust system ... (are) patient in Geneva and
(are) just ... willing to say `nyet' ... the Soviets will eventually
come to join with us in ... a transition to a different strategic
regime in which defenses play an ever-increasing role,'' Cooper said.

   The last two of three Van Gogh paintings
stolen from a museum last year were recovered Thursday, Dutch
television and other news reports said.
   Vincent van Gogh's 1887 work ``Wilted Sunflowers'' and an early
version of his famous ``Potato Eaters'' painted in 1885 were
recovered, slightly damaged, the national news agency reported.
   Recovery of the paintings, whose total value has been estimated
at $72 million to $90 million, followed the arrests in recent weeks
of four people suspected in the Dec. 12, 1988, theft from the
Kroeller-Mueller Museum, 13 miles from Ede.
   In April, the thieves returned the third stolen painting, the
Dutch impressionist's 1884 work ``The Loom,'' in an attempt to
enforce a ransom demand of $2.2 million for the others.
   According to the agency report, the paintings were delivered to
police Thursday afternoon by the lawyer for one suspect. The lawyer
was not identified and police refused to confirm the report.
   The news agency said the four arrests followed another ransom
demand made early last month, but did not give a figure or say
whether any money had been paid.
   None of the four suspects, aged 22-37, has been identified, in
keeping with Dutch police practice. Two have been released pending
charges, the agency report said.
   The thieves smashed a 6-foot-wide hole in a window of the
Kroeller-Mueller Museum, in a remote location in the middle of a
large national park near the village of Otterlo.
   Police, stymied by an almost total lack of clues, put the case on
the back burner. In March, after several months of silence, the
thieves contacted museum director R.W.D. Oxenaar to demand the
ransom.
   On April 6, Oxenaar received a telephone call at his home from a
man who said ``The Loom,'' valued at $18 million to $22 million,
could be found in the trunk of a car parked nearby.
   The painting, wrapped in a blanket, was found with only a few
scratches so minute that officials first thought it had not been
damaged at all.
   A few days later, a caller told Oxenaar to have a driver standing
by with the money, but the ransom exchange fell through.
   Art experts had speculated the paintings would be held for ramsom
because they are so well-known that they would be virtually
unsellable on the open market.
   The final and most famous version of ``Potato Eaters,'' also
dated 1885, is on display at the Vincent van Gogh National Museum in
Amsterdam. The museum has the largest collection of works by the
impressionist, who lived from 1853 to 1890.

<HEAD>Senate Chairman Attacks Administration's Drug War As `Phony'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a Senate narcotics
subcommittee, attacking the anti-drug campaigns of the Reagan and
Bush administrations as ``phony,'' proposed a $120 million program
Thursday to help local police establish and expand drug intelligence
units.
   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., introduced legislation to provide
direct aid to local police departments for computers, electronic
intelligence-gathering equipment and added personnel for anti-drug
task forces.
   ``It's time we gave police officers .... the kind of support they
deserve,'' Kerry said at a news conference. ``We would be expanding
the kind of police work which prevents drug-related crime from
happening in the first place.''
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations narcotics
subcommittee said $63 million would go to state governments _ at
least $500,000 to each state _ for drug intelligence units and
equipment. About two-fifths of that money would be passed on to
cities with fewer than 100,000 people.
   The rest of the money, $57 million, would go directly from the
Justice Department to big cities.
   Kerry said the Drug Intelligence Act would ``provide an extra
boost to local police departments at a time when their budgets are
the tightest but their needs in fighting a real war on drugs are the
greatest.''
   ``Police drug intelligence units that already exist in major
cities are important components in the war on drugs,'' he said.
``But even where these units exist, they need upgrading and more
equipment.''
   Kerry, deriding the anti-drug efforts of Republican
administrations through the 1980s, said the Bush administration has
spent only $500 million of the $2.7 billion Congress allocated last
year for the government's anti-drug effort.
   ``We don't have a real war on drugs today,'' Kerry said.
``They're talking out of both sides of their mouth. ... It's phony.''

   France uncorked three days of bicentennial hoopla
Thursday by inaugurating a gleaming, high-tech opera house at the
site of the Bastille, the despised prison where its revolution began.
   President Francois Mitterrand, President Bush, and their wives
sat in front-row balcony seats at the Opera Bastille for an opening
concert featuring singers Placido Domingo and Barbara Hendricks.
   Also present were 32 other presidents and prime ministers who
came to Paris for this weekend's celebrations of the revolution's
200th anniversary and for the annual summit of the world's seven
richest countries.
   Sharpshooters were posted on rooftops and in windows of buildings
surrounding the Place de la Bastille as the leaders arrived.
Authorities have clamped tight and highly visible security around
the capital this week.
   Later Thursday, more than 100,000 people jammed into the large
circular plaza for the beginning of the largest of about 30,000
outdoor popular balls around the country to celebrate Bastille Day
on Friday.
   Surrounding streets were packed with people of all ages, enjoying
the balmy summer night. The air was filled with the smell of
grilling sausages and the sounds of exploding firecrackers and
accordion music pouring from a giant white tent opposite the new
Opera.
   ``I usually prefer smaller parties, but I wanted to come be part
of the most popular of French celebrations,'' said Gilles Driate,
from a southeastern suburb. He then grabbed the hand of a surprised
and delighted lady with gray hair, and they danced away.
   Meanwhile, Mitterrand and his guests had a late dinner at the
Musee d'Orsay, the spectacular museum of 19th century art converted
from a train station.
   Earlier in the day at the Opera Bastille, the political leaders
were joined by a star-studded crowd including actress Catherine
Deneuve, tennis player Yannick Noah, and Nobel Peace Prize-winning
author Elie Wiesel.
   A rousing orchestral rendition of the Marseillaise, the French
national anthem, opened the show. The 75-minute program ended with
an even more stirring version, with all the performers joining in.
   Bush, smiling broadly, applauded enthusiastically as the show
closed.
   The visiting leaders earlier joined Mitterrand in an outdoor
ceremony honoring the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the
Citizen proclaimed in 1789.
   Mitterrand was flanked by Bush at the Trocadero, across the Seine
from the Eiffel Tower, during the brief celebration of what many
consider the chief legacy of the French Revolution.
   At the new opera house, Domingo, Miss Hendricks and Teresa
Berganza sang selections from French operas such as Charles-Francois
Gounod's ``Faust'' and Camille Saint-Saen's ``Samson and Delila.''
   France's Georges Pretre conducted the orchestra and chorus of the
Orchestre de Paris in a work titled ``La Nuit d'avant le Jour,'' or
``The Night Before the Day.'' The staging and the stark, elegant
decor were the work of American Bob Wilson, the darling of French
avant-garde theater.
   The Opera Bastille was conceived early in Mitterrand's first
presidential term as a much-needed alternative to the ornate but
inadequate Palais Garnier, known worldwide as the Paris Opera.
   From the start, the project was beset with administrative,
political and financial problems, and it even came close to being
canceled.
   Designed by Canadian architect Carlos Ott, the huge
glass-and-steel building boasts state-of-the-art sound, lighting and
staging technology, including special acoustical fire curtains, a
movable proscenium and electronically controlled stage dollies that
bring in sets for an entire opera in minutes.
   The 2,700-seat main auditorium _ a contemporary blend of black
and white with oak-paneled walls and hardwood floors _ was designed
for acoustics.
   Expert opinion on the new hall was not all positive, however.
Music critic Frank Erikson of the weekly L'Express said he was
``terribly disappointed'' by the hall's acoustics.
   ``The voices do not project into the room,'' he said. ``The
singers were standing at the edge of the stage and yet the sound was
completely muffled. This is quite serious.''
   The Opera Bastille, which is shaped like an ocean liner, was
captainless until May when Myung-Whun Chung of South Korea was named
musical director by Pierre Berge, the financial wizard behind the
Yves-Saint Laurent fashion empire. Berge was chosen by Mitterrand to
oversee the project in its final days.
   Chung, a soft-spoken but determined optimist known as a
consummate artist, fills the vacancy left in January when Berge
fired Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim for his high fees and
elitist ideas about opera.
   Chung has promised to present the first production in February.
The Opera Bastille will close July 20 so the building can be
finished.
   The human rights celebration at the Trocadero was a simple but
dramatic reading of the 17 articles of declaration adopted by the
French National Assembly on Aug. 26, 1789.
   Punctuating the reading was a group of 48 children singing ``The
Song of Joy,'' a hymn composed for the occasion. The choir members,
who have been rehearsing since July 1, were from the United States,
Poland, Finland, the Soviet Union, West Germany, France, Japan,
Rwanda, Togo, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Hungary, Lebanon and the
Philippines.
   The three American singers were from the Phoenix, Ariz., Boys'
Choir. ``We wanted to symbolize peace,'' said Harvey Smith, director
of the Phoenix choir who helped train the Paris group. ``The
children brought things from their world and shared them with those
here today.''

<HEAD>House OKs Fee for Ham Radio Operators</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A House committee voted Thursday to levy
licensing fees on ham-radio operators and satellite-launching
companies and to increase fees on communications businesses to help
reduce the federal budget deficit by $50 million.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee also voted to outlaw
obscene dial-a-porn messages on interstate and intrastate telephone
calls and to restrict access to indecent dial-a-porn messages.
   It adopted a new fairness doctrine that requires broadcasters to
air opposing views on controversial public issues.
   The committee attached the dial-a-porn and fairness doctrine
motions to a budget reconciliation bill. The $50 million in
increased fees were to help Congress meet the $110 billion deficit
limit established by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law for
fiscal 1990.
   Under the committee's bill, existing licensing fees charged by
the Federal Communications Commission will go up an average of 12.6
percent.
   Seventeen communications areas that were exempted will have fees
for the first time, ranging from $30 for an amateur radio license to
$70,000 for a permit to launch a satellite, said committee spokesman
Mike Connolly.
   FCC fines that have not been changed since 1934 also will be
increased, Connolly said.
   He said the ``vast majority'' of the $50 million will come from
new fees, with about a third of the money coming from private radio
operations such a rural radio, national paging services, offshore
radio and mobile and cellular phones.
   Minimum fees in nearly all cases will be $30, as opposed to $5
currently. The $70,000 for satellites is the maximum. Other fees
include a $6,760 fee for a telephone company that requested an FCC
hearing.
   The dial-a-porn provision is in response to a Supreme Court
ruling last month that invalidated a 1988 law that had outlawed the
$2 billion dial-a-porn business.
   The court said indecent speech was protected by the constitution
but that obscene speech was not.
   The court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that is
patently offensive, purient and has no serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value.
   Connolly said the committee's action ``takes the ruling of the
court and works with those constitutional restraints. It bans
obsecne speech ... and it regulates indecent speech.''
   The bill requires telephone companies to block dial-a-porn calls
to their customers' lines unless a customer formally asks to have
access to the service.
   The fairness doctrine was added only after the committee voted
35-8 against an amendment by Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, to strip the
provision from the bill.
   Tauke said the fairness doctrine, a set of guidelines the FCC
repealed in 1987, was unnecessary, unconstitutional and made the
bill ``veto bait'' at the White House.
   The House and Senate Commerce committees both passed fairness
doctrine bills in April. President Bush has indicated he would veto
a fairness doctrine law, and fairness doctrine proponents were not
assured of enough votes to override a veto.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Hungarians on
Thursday mourned longtime Communist Party leader Janos Kadar, who
died last week more than a year after being eased from power by
reformers.
   ``We came to thank him for what he did for us and the Hungarian
people,'' said Viktor Segre, who said he and his wife, Eva, waited
more than three hours to view Kadar's red and black shrouded casket
lying in state at the Central Committee headquarters in Budapest.
   Kadar, 77, died on July 6. He is to be buried Friday in a state
ceremony attended by Hungary's new leadership and delegations from
the Warsaw Pact.
   On Thursday, mourners, many weeping and carrying flowers,
gathered in the late afternoon to pay their respects to Kadar, who
took power as Soviet troops crushed the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising.
   In the 32 years before he was ousted by a new generation of
reformers in 1988, Kadar was conciliatory or ruthless by turns as he
searched for consensus in party ranks.
   But Kadar gained respect at home and abroad by the 1970s after
launching economic reforms and ushering in a new spirit of tolerance
that was in stark contrast to the early years of his rule and many
neighboring communist countries.
   Kadar's legacy of stability and reform efforts appeared to have
drawn many to the austere center of communist power in Hungary,
bedecked on Thursday with wreaths and floral displays in his memory.
   ``He gave us peace and a sense of security,'' said Eva Segre.
``He got the country going again after 1956 and won international
respect for Hungary.''
   ``Comrade Kadar was a great man,'' said an elderly woman, who
asked not to be identified. She said she waited four hours and
``would have waited longer if I had to.''
   The line of those waiting to file through the hushed gallery of
the Central Committee building stretched more than four city blocks.
Hundreds clutched small bouquets of carnations and roses and many
carried large wreaths.
   In May 1988, Kadar lost his post as party general secretary. A
year later, he was removed as honorary party chairman and stripped
of his membership in the policy-setting Central Committee, which
criticized him for mistakes during his long rule.
   Although he ushered in economic reforms in the late 1960s and
early 1970s, Kadar was increasingly blamed for an economic decline
after the reforms stalled. Many in the party leadership viewed him
as an obstacle to renewal in the country.
   The Communist Party's re-evaluation of the 1956 uprising as a
popular revolt and the rehabilitation of Imre Nagy, the prime
minister who led it, eroded the legitimacy of Kadar's rule for many.
   Nagy was executed in 1958 and was buried in an unmarked grave.
His remains were reburied in an elaborate ceremony June 16 that was
attended by hundreds of thousands of Hungarians.
   Under the leadership of a new generation of reformers, Hungary
has embarked on an ambitious program of economic and political
reforms designed to move the nation toward a market economy and
closer ties to the West.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Elections Will Be Fair: Dodd</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said Thursday that
Nicaragua's national elections next year will be fair and free and
that its Sandinista government deserves some credit for that from
the Bush administration.
   Dodd, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
Latin America, also said he expects significant progress in the
Latin American peace process at the Aug. 7 meeting of the region's
presidents.
   Dodd returned early this week from a visit to the region, and
told a news conference the Bush administration should be encouraging
the process by rewarding the Sandinista government for its progress.
   The administration, he said, has characterized its policy toward
Nicaragua as one of ``carrots and sticks,'' rewards when progress is
made toward democratic reforms and sanctions when there are reverses.
   ``At this point, there have been no carrots offered,'' Dodd said.
``You almost get the sense that the administration is disappointed
that the Nicaraguans have made progress in some areas.''
   Asked for an example of positive steps taken by the Sandinistas,
Dodd cited the provisions made for election observers to be present
in the country for a full six months before the balloting and for
impromtu political rallies.
   ``On paper it doesn't look bad,'' he said. ``I can see these
words come back to haunt me in 10 months. But on paper, it's not
bad.''
   On another subject, Dodd sharply criticized the Organization of
American States for taking no action against Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, Panama's military ruler, who retained power in May after
nullifying the results of presidential elections.
   ``If the OAS cannot be supportive on Noriega, I don't think we
can get together on anything,'' Dodd said.

<HEAD>Nurses Strike Puts Hospital Group at One-Fifth Patient Load</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patients of the state's largest hospital company
had to cross picket lines to see their doctors Thursday as 1,300
nurses began striking for higher wages and guaranteed hours.
   The strike left Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound with a
non-union staff capable of handling only one-fifth of the normal
patient load at its three hospitals.
   About 130 patients were moved to other hospitals and 72 remained,
said Phil Nudelman, the health maintenance organization's executive
vice president and chief operating officer.
   Negotiations broke off shortly after midnight Thursday, and
picketing began at 6 a.m. at Group Health hospitals and clinics in
five Puget Sound counties that include this city and Tacoma.
   Picket lines were up at all Group Health centers except its
specialty medical center, which provides urology, oncology, internal
medicine and other services, Sosne said.
   The cooperative also runs 23 family medical centers and four
specialty medical centers. All the centers will be open and staffed
by physicians and other staff, Nudelman said.
   Group Health began hiring non-union nurses and preparing to lay
off non-nursing staff in preparation for what's expected to be a
long strike, Nudelman said. The layoffs were intended to save money.
   Diane Sosne, president of Local 1199 of the National Union and
Health Care Employees, said the talks broke off because Group Health
refused to compromise on key issues, particularly staffing decisions.
   Nudelman said the cooperative's latest offer was still on the
table, and that a phone call was all that was needed to reopen talks.
   ``Our wage and benefit package would make Group Health nurses the
best paid in the state of Washington,'' he said. ``It would also
give our nurses significant input into decision-making that directly
affects their workplace.'' The latest contract offer would boost
yearly pay for a first-year nurse to $27,706 from $23,000, based on
a 40-hour work week. A nurse with 15 years' experience would earn
about $41,000, up from $33,000.
   The nurses were seeking raises of 16 percent in the first year
and 14 percent in the second. Management's offer amounts to 23.5
percent over two years.
   Also at issue in the talks is the company's practice of cutting
nurses' hours when there are few patients in the hospital. The

<HEAD>Biologists Rescue Rare Trout From Ashy Creek; Fires Contained Elsewhere</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `The creek ...,' to restore dropped word `began.'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SILVER CITY, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Biologists on Thursday used long-handled
nets to scoop an endangered species of trout from a creek polluted
with ash from a nearly beaten wild fire. Firefighters mopped up
blazes in five other Western states.
   The Gila trout, lured into a clear section of Diamond Creek a day
earlier, were collected along a three-quarter mile stretch and put
in holding tanks on the sides of mules or horses to be taken
eventually to an Apache fish hatchery.
   ``They are hoping to remove at least 300 of the fish from the
creek and more if possible,'' said Andrea Garcia, a U.S. Forest
Service spokeswoman.
   The creek was becoming choked by ash from a lightning-caused fire
in Gila National Forest that burned more than 10,000 acres before
being contained on Monday. The blaze began June 30 and burned 50
miles northeast of Silver City.
   The fire should be controlled in two to four days, Ms. Garcia
said.
   Fires in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nebraska and Utah were
largely contained Thursday. Firefighters mostly mopped up and
monitored hot spots.
   Ash kicked up by the New Mexico blaze had settled in Diamond
Creek, choking off oxygen and possibly boosting the water's
alkalinity.
   The netted fish were to be transported in 250-gallon aerated
tanks aboard two trucks to a hatchery run by the U.S. Bureau of
Indian Affairs on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in south-central
New Mexico, said Ms. Garcia.
   She said the fish are fairly hardy.
   Gila trout once were widespread in mountain streams in the Gila
River Basin. But timber cutting, overgrazing, irrigation and the
introduction of rainbow trout have diminished their numbers.
   The fish has been on the federal endangered species list since
1967.
   The rescue was undertaken by the state Department of Game and
Fish, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service.
   In Utah, fire bosses took a wait-and-see attitude Thursday on the
state's only active wildfire, a 100-acre blaze in an inaccessible
area of Desolation Canyon, 140 miles southeast of Salt Lake City.
The fire was within a mile of an Uintah and Ouray Indian reservation
and threatened important deer and elk winter ranges, said Bureau of
Land Management district manager Gene Nodine.
   ``If the fire does make a major run, we would have to wait until
it reached a more accessible, less hazardous area to actively
suppress it,'' he said.
   Humidity rose significantly in eastern Utah, helping firefighters
subdue a 4,500-acre fire 28 miles from Grand Junction, Colo. Thirty
miles to the northwest, firefighters demobilized after battling a
15,500-acre fire for more than a week.
   In California, a fire near the Ventana Wilderness in the Los
Padres National Forest was 70 percent contained. More than 1,500
firefighters were on the firelines at the blaze, which burned 3,087
acres. Three other fires were contained.
   Five of six fires that have blackened nearly 9,000 acres in
Colorado have been declared contained. The sixth, a 2,000-acre blaze
fire in north-central Colorado near Fort Collins, was 95 percent
contained, officials said.
   In Nebraska's northwest corner, the Fort Robinson fire, which
destroyed 10,000 acres of the 22,000-acre Fort Robinson State Park,
was contained with full control expected by Friday, said Fire Chief
Bill Gartner. The blaze destroyed 14 structures and injured nine
people, none seriously.
   Arizona firefighters battled a 225-acre fire next to the Mogollon
Rim in east-central Arizona and expected to contain it on Saturday.
Every other major fire in the state was declared contained
Wednesday. Some 3,000 acres burned.

   Sri Lankan soldiers and police will
take charge of law and order from Indian troops in the northeast,
who then will be treated as an occupational army, Foreign Minister
Ranjan Wijeratne said Thursday.
   He said the takeover will occur July 29, the deadline President
Ranasinghe Premadasa set for the pullout of 40,000 Indian troops
deployed in Sri Lanka. India is refusing to withdraw them.
   A moderate Tamil leader who supported the deployment of Indian
soldiers in Sri Lanka and a party colleague were killed in a Colombo
home Thursday, officials said.
   In his comments Thursday, Wijeratne said President Ranasinghe
Premadasa would stick to the pullout deadline.
   ``Sri Lankan army and police will come out of their barracks to
maintain law and order in the north and east, because after July 29
the Indian troops will be treated as an occupational army,''
Wijeratne said.
   On Wednesday, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said a pullout
of the troops could only be decided through negotiations and had to
be accompanied by increasing powers for the Tamil government in the
Northeastern Province. The message was tantamount to refusing to
withdraw the troops by Premadasa's deadline.
   In a reply Thursday, Premadasa said military action by the Indian
armed forces was ``unnecessary and prejudicial to a settlement by
discussion and negotiation.''
   He said his government was willing to hold talks on the issue but
the pullout and political issue were ``totally unconnected.''
   Indian soldiers were deployed in Sri Lanka's Tamil-dominated
north and east on July 29, 1987, under an agreement between the two
countries. The Indian-mediated accord was aimed at ending a
rebellion by Tamil insurgents.
   The rebels were to give up their weapons in exchange for limited
autonomy in regions where they dominated and Indian soldiers were to
ensure peace.
   But the peace plan fell apart after the largest rebel group, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, backed out and began fighting the
Indians. Smaller Tamil groups surrendered and were voted to power in
the province's local elections last year but now accuse the
government of not giving them enough power.
   The moderate Tamil leader who was killed was identified by an
Information Department official as Appapillai Amirthalingam, the
62-year-old leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front. The
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said another party
member was also killed and three people were injured.
   In New Delhi, the United News of India news agency said
Amirthalingam and his colleague were killed by three gunmen
belonging to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The three gunmen
were later shot and killed by Amirthalingam's bodyguards, the news
agency said.
   India and Sri Lanka exchanged sharply worded letters after
Premadasa asked India on June 1 to pull out its soldiers by the
second anniversary of the agreement. The request followed talks in
May between his government and the Tamil Tigers, the first direct
contact between the two sides since the insurgency began in 1983.
   Under the 1987 agreement, Indian soldiers took over law and order
in the north and east and Sri Lankan troops were confined to their
barracks.
   India became involved in the troubles of the island nation off
its southern coast because of the sympathies of its own 60 million
Tamils for the rebel cause. Sri Lankan Tamils launched a war for a
separate nation complaining of discrimination by the majority
Sinhalese community.
   The predominantly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people, and the Buddhist Sinhalese make up 75 percent.
   Also Thursday, officials announced that more than 40,000 public
transport workers ended a crippling monthlong strike after reaching
a wage agreement with the government.
   Bus drivers, clerks and mechanics of the state-owned transport
company walked off their jobs on June 12, demanding higher wages.
But the government said the strike was sponsored by Sinhalese
militants using the wage issue to fuel civil unrest.
   The militants say the government has been too soft on the Tamils.
   Transport Minister Wijepala Mendis said in a statement that the
government would increase workers' monthly salaries by $5.60 and
give monthly back pay of $1.50 retroactive to January 1982.

   The Labor Party backed away from a threat to
leave the government after the Bush administration and American Jews
asked it Thursday not to upset Israeli peace proposals.
   An aide to Finance Minister Shimon Peres said Israel had indirect
contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization through U.S.
intermediaries.
   Peres, who leads the party, said Labor ``has no aspiration to
break up the government. The Labor Party aims to work for the
advancement of the peace plan. Now the campaign is on continuing the
peace initiative.''
   In Jerusalem, a tear gas grenade exploded Thursday night during
the closing ceremony of the international Maccabiah Games for Jewish
athletes.
   Thousands of people, including Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamire,
attended the ceremony at the Western Wall in Arab east Jerusalem,
holiest site of Judaism.
   The cloud of acrid smoke set hundreds of people running. Several
were treated for smoke inhalation.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandouri said the grenade could have been
thrown by Arab nationalists or accidentally dropped by a police
officer. Israel army radio said several suspects were detained, but
did not elaborate.
   Jerusalem police chief Aryeh Bibi said later the grenade was not
of the type used by police and was not dropped by a policemen.
   In the occupied territories, Israeli soldiers killed a
Palestinian on Wednesday night when masked youths attacked an army
patrol in the Gaza Strip with knives and axes, the army said.
   The death raised to 560 the number of Palestinians killed in the
19-month uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and
Gaza. Thirty-five Israelis have been slain.
   Eight Arabs were reported wounded Thursday.
   In London, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe met with Bassam
Abu Sharif of the PLO and urged the PLO to follow a moderate line,
the Foreign Office reported. It said the meeting was the first
between a British Cabinet officer and a senior PLO official.
   Israel's deputy foreign minister, Benyamin Netanyahu, called the
meeting was ``a setback not only for genuine peace in the Middle
East, but ... for British policy against terrorism.''
   Peres spoke after Labor ministers met Wednesday night and decided
to stay in the governing coalition if Shamir reaffirms his
commitment to the peace initiative.
   Labor Party leaders recommended Monday the party quit the Cabinet
to protest hard-line conditions for peace talks with the
Palestinians. The conditions, including an end to the uprising
before peace talks are held, were adopted by Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc July 5.
   Labor leaders did not cancel a party vote on the issue set for
next month, but many ministers said a compromise was possible.
   The Labor move followed appeals from Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and American Jewish leaders for Labor to stay in the
government. The State Department denied it sought to intervene, but
Israeli officials confirmed the appeals.
   President Bush said Thursday the United States will not change
its Middle East policy. He said Israel should go forward with
elections in which the 1.7 million Palestinians of the occupied
lands would elect representatives to negotiate with Israel.
   Leading voices within Likud said they wanted Labor to stay and
the peace plan remained intact.
   Netanyahu said: ``If they want to leave, it's their business,''
but added: ``I don't think it would be proper at this moment.''
   Shamir aide Yossi Ahimeir said the prime minister met with
Palestinian leaders from the occupied lands about the election plan,
and some observers said the meetings were timed to pacify Labor.
   ``There have been, there are and there will be meetings with
Palestinians from the territories ... but there were no meetings
with PLO people or those linked or close to the PLO,'' Ahimeir said.
   Israeli radio reported that PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdel-Rahman said
his organization has had direct contacts with Israeli officials,
including a discussion with a messenger of Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, and that Shamir was aware of it.
   Shamir, Peres and Rabin, as well as the Foreign and Justice
ministries, denied direct or indirect contacts with the PLO.
Shamir's office director, Yossi Ben-Aharon, dismissed such reports
by describing the PLO as ``the embodiment of cheating, lies and
obscenity.''
   Peres deputy Yossi Beilin said, however, that indirect but
``clear, official, unequivocal negotiations have been under way ...
via the Americans'' for more than two months.
   Israel television said U.S. Ambassador William Brown routinely
briefs Peres and Rabin on the U.S.-PLO talks in Tunisia and the PLO
is briefed on Israeli positions.

   The Senate on Thursday approved an overhaul of
the immigration system that would limit new arrivals to 630,000 in
each of the next three years and expand the number coming from
Western Europe.
   ``This bill not only carries forward and increases the present
emphasis on family reunification, it also opens opportunities for
new immigrants with new skills,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., one of the bill's sponsors.
   The bill, approved 81-17 after two days of debate, now goes to
the House. It was originally designed to cap immigration at 600,000
in each of the next three years but was expanded by 30,000 visas
before final passage.
   The ceiling represents 136,000 more visas than were issued in
1988, but but critics say the bill still could reduce visas for all
but the closest relatives of American citizens and permanent
residents of the United States.
   The Senate approved a similar bill in 1988 but it died in the
House.
   The measure now goes to the House with Kennedy and the measure's
co-sponsor, Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., saying they are optimistic
about the prospects this year.
   Lawmakers voted 78-21 to expand the cap by 30,000 visas a year
following an emotional appeal from Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who
recalled how his father fled ``the boot of the czar'' in 1911 and
arrived in America ``with no rubles in his pocket. He had to come
steerage.''
   ``There is nothing magic to me about the number 600,000,''
Specter said.
   But senators fought back 52-46 a move by Sen. Rudy Boschwitz,
R-Minn., to expand by 40,000 the number of brothers and sisters of
American citizens that would be allowed into the country annually.
   ``My heart is on the side of what Sen. Boschwitz is doing,'' Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., said. But he added that ``there is a saturation
point with the American public and I want to be prudent as we move
ahead.''
   Simpson said it was ``time to face the unfortunate but hideously
cold reality that there are many more people who want to come here
than there is room or intent to accommodate them.''
   Following intense floor skirmishing, the Senate did approve an
amendment from Sen. Richard C. Shelby, D-Ala., that would force the
Census Bureau to halt its practice of including illegal aliens in
its official count.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said that under the current system
``states like California would gain a (congressional) seat at North
Carolina's expense'' because their populations are swollen with
illegal aliens.
   Kennedy called the amendment ``flatly unconstitutional,'' but
lawmakers refused 58-41 to kill it and eventually adopted it on a
voice vote.
   The legislation would reserve 120,000 visas annually for those
entering on a basis other than family ties.
   That category includes 54,000 visas subject to a point system
giving credit for those with special skills needed by American
industry but who do not have employers ready to sponsor them.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-2 to delete the provision
that would provide extra points to individuals who speak English.
Simpson appealed to the Senate in vain to restore the point system
but lawmakers rejected the idea, 56-43.
   ``English is the language of success,'' he declared. He said
those who are unable to understand English will have a tough time
obtaining jobs and urged lawmakers not to be swayed by sentimental
portrayals as immigrants as the heart and soul of the American dream.
   ``The heart and soul disappears when you can't get work,'' he
said.
   Simon, however, quoted a news clipping that said 13 of the 16
valedictorians in Boston's publish high schools this year were born
in foreign countries and the majority apparently did not have
English for a mother tongue.
   Simpson expressed frustration that the sentiment-tinged debate
appeared to be going against him.
   ``You have snorted and ripped and rolled around in it and you
have just given birth to a mouse,'' he declared.
   Meanwhile, the House approved, 358-44, and sent to the Senate
separate legislation to ease immigration of certain Soviet and
Southeast Asian refugees.
   It would temporarily re-establish the legal status of Soviet Jews
and evangelican Christians as well as certain categories of
Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians as persecuted, without
individuals having to prove it in their own cases. That would aid
them in obtaining standing as refugees.
   The measure is opposed by the Bush administration, which contends
it unnecessarily establishes special preferences for certain
refugees and makes it more difficult to administer the U.S. refugee
program fairly.
   Those voting against the measure were Sens. John Breaux, D-La.;
Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.; Kent Conrad, D-N.D.;
Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; J. James Exon Jr., D-Neb., Wendell Ford,
D-Ky.; Albert Gore, D-Tenn.; Howell Heflin, D-Ala.; Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.; Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md.; Harry Reid, D-Nev.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Shelby,
and Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   Not voting were Sens. James Jeffords, R-N.H., and Spark
Matsunaga, D-Fla.

   President Bush supplied the key to help unlock the
biggest birthday party in French history Thursday as swanky dinners
and the opera took center stage after the president's four-day trip
to Eastern Europe.
   Bush and more than 30 other world leaders were treated to a swirl
of festivities celebrating the 200th anniversary of the French
Revolution.
   The events ranged from a solemn ceremony commemorating the
drafting of the French version of America's Declaration of
Independence to an offbeat parade capping the celebration Friday
that will feature Russians dancing with a bear on ice, Britons
marching under artificial rain and a Florida band moonwalking up the
famed Champs Elysee.
   To guard against terrorist attacks, 30,000 police were deployed
around the city with rooftop marksmen and even ground-to-air
missiles added to the security dragnet.
   Amid the hoopla of the birthday bash, more weighty issues were
being discussed as well. The president's other reason for being in
Paris was to attend his first economic summit of the leaders of the
world's seven richest nations.
   The 15th annual economic conference among the leaders of the
United States, Japan, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and
Canada was to feature for the first time a major emphasis on ways to
clean up the global environment.
   With his historic trip to Poland and Hungary still very much on
his mind, Bush indicated he would be urging the other summit leaders
to step forward with assistance packages of their own to further
economic and political reform behind the Iron Curtain.
   Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on the flight from
Budapest to Paris, Bush said he believed his four-day trip had
``given encouragement to those who want to go the path of reform,
political change, economic change.''
   His national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said the
president would encourage his summit partners to create a
``clearinghouse'' to avoid duplication of the assistance packages
offered by the rich nations.
   On the Middle East, Bush said that the United States would not
relax its policy of opposing Israeli settlements in the occupied
territories in order to accommodate political turmoil in Israel, a
country Bush conceded is best by ``great difficulties.''
   Bush was greeted by French President Francois Mitterrand, with
whom he later met, at the inaugural bicentennial event, a reading of
the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the document that proclaimed
in October 1789 the French Revolution's aims of liberty, equality
and fraternity for all.
   At the end of the ceremony at the historic Place du Trocadero,
children threw peace laurels, flowers and children's toys on a stone
inscribed with the declaration while 500 doves were released into a
cloudless sky.
   Bush also participated in a ceremony in which the key to the
Bastille prison was turned over to Mitterrand. The Bastille was the
central Paris prison stormed by the populace on July 14, 1789,
setting off the revolution.
   The key to the fortress had been presented 199 years ago to
President George Washington by the Marquis de la Fayette, who had
served as a general under Washington during the American Revolution.
   The key ceremony represented a brief loan with the artifact
headed back to Washington's home in northern Virginia after the
bicentennial is over.
   Bush and the other world leaders attended the inaugural concert
of the Opera Bastille Thursday night where they descended a dramatic
gray stone staircase leading to the modern glass-and-steel opera
house.
   Mitterand, who considers himself a champion of the rights of the
poor, invited several leaders of poor Third World countries to
partake in the festivities, hoping to formulate a dialogue between
the haves and have-nots.
   Leaders from both the rich and poor nations dined together
Thursday night on an opulent meal of lobster with artichokes, lamb,
Roquefort cheese with figs and nuts and, for dessert, almond ice
cream with apricot sauce. They washed it all down with four
different wines.
   The leaders of Egypt, India, Venezuela and Senegal issued a call
to Mitterrand to help organize a North-South summit between
developed and developing nations and the French president endorsed
the idea.
   East-West relations and developments in Eastern Europe, said
French presidential spokesman Hubert Vedrine, figured prominently in
Mitterrand's 40-minute discussions with Bush. ``The two men are on
the same wavelength,'' Vedrine told reporters.
   He said Bush and Mitterrand agreed the economic and democratic
reforms in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union ``offer a whole new
perspective for the first time in 40 years.''

<TEXT>
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, the
longest-serving incumbent governor in the nation, said Thursday he
will not seek a fifth term in 1990.
   The announcement set off a political scramble for the governor's
seat. But the 53-year-old Republican, who was mentioned early in his
political career as a presidential contender, said he hoped his
legacy would go far beyond the coming battle to succeed him.
   ``I believe with all my heart that in most ways this is a better
state, with a better chance for the future, than when I entered the
governorship in January of 1977,'' said Thompson, who was near tears
during a 30-minute news conference at the State of Illinois Center.
   Thompson, flanked by his wife, Jayne, and their 10-year-old
daughter, Samantha, said he chose to leave public life because he
needed to provide for his family and sought the challenge of
returning to the private sector as a lawyer or businessman.
   Thompson declined to rule out running for another office, and
said he could have won another term as governor.
   ``My wife and daughter have told me they are willing to support a
campaign for re-election, but I am not willing at this time to ask
them to do that,'' Thompson said. ``My family and their happiness
and security are more important to me than anything else in the
world.''
   Mrs. Thompson, who spent a month earlier this year at the Betty
Ford Clinic in California undergoing treatment for alcoholism, said
she supported the decision and acknowledged that public life
extracted a toll from the family.
   ``I think it's sometimes difficult to live your life in the
public eye,'' she said.
   Jockeying for position has already begun among possible
candidates for next year's primary race for governor. At least three
Democrats and as many Republicans are considered possible
candidates, with Democratic Attorney General Neil Hartigan and GOP
Secretary of State Jim Edgar among top likely contenders.
   Though titular leader of the state GOP and a backer of President
Bush, the moderate Thompson has frequently been at odds with fellow
Republicans on fiscal and social issues.
   Thompson was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate after
his 1976 and 1978 victories made him one of the few Republicans to
buck the post-Watergate wave that swamped many GOP colleagues.
   He first burst into the national spotlight during a four-year
tenure as the U.S. attorney from 1971-75, when he sent several
prominent allies of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley to prison on
corruption charges.
   Passing up an offer to run against Daley, Thompson instead
claimed the GOP gubernatorial nomination in 1976 and defeated
Daley-backed Democrat Michael Howlett by a record 1.39 million votes.
   He bested former Democratic U.S. Sen. Adlai Stevenson III in his
last two campaigns _ in 1982 by the narrowest margin in state
history, and again in 1986 to become the only four-term governor in
state history.
   The son of a Chicago physician, Thompson once autographed a
high-school yearbook, ``Vote for me for president.'' But he spent
much of his early career in law _ as a Cook County prosecutor, a
Northwestern University law professor and an assistant state
attorney general.

<HEAD>Child Kills Sister Hours after Gun Bill Signed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A baby died Thursday after being shot by
her 6-year-old sister hours after Gov. Bob Martinez signed a bill to
protect children from accidental shootings in the home.
   Nine-month-old Enereida Suarez of Tampa was the fourth Florida
child killed this summer in an accidental shooting.
   She was shot late Wednesday after her sister, Llasmin, found a
.38-caliber revolver lying under a towel on their parents' bed,
police said.
   Martinez was horrified by the news, said his press secretary,
Jack Peck.
   ``It just underscores the whole problem, when a child is shot
just hours after he signs a bill to stop these things from
happening,'' Peck said.
   Although the law signed by Martinez doesn't take effect until
Oct. 1, Tampa authorities could bring charges under existing laws.
   ``We will gather all the information and turn it over to the
state attorney's office for review under the culpable negligence
statute,'' said police spokesman Steve Cole.
   Under the new law, no grieving parent of an injured or fatally
wounded child shot by another member of the family could be arrested
until seven days after the incident.
   The law provides for adults to be charged with a felony,
punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine, if a
child shoots himself or another because of the owner's carelessness.
   If a minor threatens someone with the gun or displays it in
public, the gun owner faces a misdemeanor charge and up to 60 days
in jail and a $500 fine.
   The law requires gun owners to prevent loaded weapons kept in
homes and businesses from falling into the hands of children 15 and
younger by using such precautions as trigger locks or keeping a
weapon in a locked box.
   Three children died in early June in similar household shootings,
inspiring lawmakers to push for the legislation during a special
session intended to deal with other issues last month.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell in much of the eastern two-thirds of the nation
Thursday, including storms that caused flooding in the Philadelphia
area and a thunderstorm that unleashed 81-mph winds in Georgia.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms stretched from western
portions of the central Plains to central Oklahoma, and from eastern
Texas to the central Gulf Coast states, Florida and southern Georgia.
   Rain and a few thunderstorms lingered in eastern North Carolina,
in rain-soaked areas of West Virginia and the mid-Atlantic states
and in portions of the Rockies.
   The Philadelphia area received more than 2 inches of rain,
causing minor flooding in low-lying areas. In northwestern West
Virginia, more than 1{ inches of rain fell in three hours in parts
of Calhoun County, where some roads were closed by high water.
   A severe thunderstorm with wind gusts to 81 mph dumped 1{ inches
of rain on Albany, Ga., within 40 minutes Thursday afternoon. Strong
thunderstorm winds snapped tree limbs at Abbeyville, Ala., where 1{
inches fell within an hour.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1} inches at Polk Mountain, W.VA., and about 1{ inches in
New Jersey at Wrightstown, McGuire Air Force Base and Lakehurst
Naval Air Station.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 53
degrees in Marysville, Calif., to 110 degrees in Palm Springs,
Calif. The low in the Lower 48 states Thursday was 34 degrees in
Burney, Calif.
   The forecast for Friday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the northern and coastal Rockies to the Great
Plains, from the Gulf Coast states to Florida, and along sections of
the Eastern Seaboard, with storms most numerous over Nebraska, South
Dakota and northeast Wyoming and from the central Gulf Coast to
northern Florida.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 70s from the Great Lakes
region to the upper Ohio Valley and the northern Atlantic Coast, in
Montana and Wyoming, and along the Pacific Coast; a few 100-degree
readings along the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and in inland valleys
of California; 100 to 115 degrees in the desert Southwest and in the
80s and 90s elsewhere.

<HEAD>Guards Kill 10 Who Tried to Kill Leftist Councilman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gunmen stormed a leftist city
councilman's house in Medellin and tried to assassinate him
Thursday, but his bodyguards killed 10 of the attackers, including
two police officers, the national police said.
   Elsewhere, leftist guerrillas kidnapped a federal congressman and
blew up the country's biggest oil pipeline for the 25th time this
year.
   The 10 slain attackers had tried to kill councilman Gonzalo
Alvarez Henao in Medellin, where drug traffickers have been
financing right-wing death squads to exterminate members of a
leftist party.
   Alvarez is the leader in Medellin of the Patriotic Union party,
organized six years ago with the support of leftist guerrillas.
   Right-wing death squads have killed 729 members of the Patriotic
Union in the last four years.
   Alvarez was attacked twice, first while he was in his car shortly
before midnight Wednesday, police Col. Antonio Sanchez Vargas said
at a news conference in Medellin.
   Alvarez's guards held off the attackers while the councilman and
other guards got away, Vargas said.
   Then, shortly after midnight, gunmen stormed the councilman's
house, and his guards killed 10 attackers, Vargas said.
   ``Unfortunately, among the dead attackers we found two policemen
who had broken their vows to serve society,'' Vargas said.
   Medellin, a city of 2 million people in northwest Colombia, is
the the headquarters for Colombia's biggest drug traffickers. The
traffickers began killing leftists after guerrillas kidnapped and
held for ransom members of some of the traffickers' families.
   Traffickers and guerrillas also are at war because the guerrillas
demand that the drug traffickers pay for having their
cocaine-processing laboratories in rebel controlled areas.
   The congressman kidnapped by guerrillas was Alfonso Campo Soto,
according to the national police in the northwest state of Cesar. He
was kidnapped Thursday in Cesar state near his ranch, the police
said.
   Police blamed the National Liberation Army, which has abducted 54
persons this year, including congressmen, mayors, city councilmen,
policemen and news reporters.
   The police quoted Campo's family as saying that the guerrillas
told them that Campo would be released soon.
   Most of the people who have been kidnapped by the guerrillas, of
the National Liberation Army, have been released after being
lectured on the guerrillas' political objectives.
   The National Liberation Army also blew up the country's main oil
pipeline Thursday for the 25th time this year, the national police
said.
   The attack again forced suspension of the pumping of 220,000
barrels of oil a day from the big Canon Limon field in northeast
Colombia.
   Colombia's oil production has plunged to 312,000 barrels a day
from 420,000 barrels a day in January because of the guerrilla
attacks, the state oil company Ecopetrol said last week.
   The pipeline runs 500 miles from the Cano Limon field to the
Caribbean port of Covenas. Cano Limon is operated jointly by
Occidental Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell and Ecopetrol.
   The National Liberation Army wants foreign oil companies out of
Colombia.
   In another development, the national police said antinarcotics
police arrested a captain and two lieutenants of the national police
on suspicion of drug trafficking.
   The three police officers were arrested Wednesday as they landed
in a helicopter in the southwest state of Valle, the police said.
The police had $259,000 in U.S. currency with them, the police said.
   The chief of the national police, Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla,
began raids on drug laboratories two hours after taking over in
January from a general who was fired by President Virgilio Barco for
allegedly trafficking in cocaine.
   Gomez has fired more than 1,000 policemen for their associations
with known drug traffickers or other criminals.

<HEAD>Senate Goes to Work On Drought Relief</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators from the South and upper Midwest
pressed Thursday to get aid for weather-damaged crops in their
states included in drought-relief legislation lawmakers are rushing
to finish this summer.
   ``We've got a comprehensive problem that's going to take a
comprehensive approach,'' Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told fellow
members of the Senate Agriculture Committee. ``The loss is great ...
and the time is short.''
   The Bush administration and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas have been backing off their insistence that drought relief be
limited to winter wheat farmers. However, it is uncertain whether
enough money would be available to cover losses of other crops.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter had said he would recommend
President Bush veto a drought relief package approved by the House
that would cover more than 500 crops and cost more than $900 million.
   However, recent flooding has severely damaged crops such as
cotton across the South, and North Dakota Gov. George Sinner this
week declared his entire state a disaster area because of hot, dry
weather.
   Soybean and cotton crops are rated fair to poor in Arkansas,
Mississippi and Louisiana primarily because of heavy rains. Crops
also have been hurt in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South
Carolina, nine southern senators said in a letter Thursday to
Yeutter.
   Parts of Louisiana have received up to 60 inches of rain, said
Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
   The committee is scheduled to vote on a drought-relief bill next
week that lawmakers hope to get approved by Congress before the
August recess.
   Dole said Yeutter could be authorized to provide aid to other
crops where farmers can demonstrate weather-related losses.
   However, he argued that the legislation should first take care of
winter wheat farmers, who already have lost much of their crop.
   ``What we need to figure out in this committee, hopefully on a
bipartisan basis, is how we're going to deal with areas that have a
demonstrated loss and how we're going to find the money,'' Dole said.
   Winter wheat farmers deserve first crack at drought relief
because most of the money the government is saving in the farm
program this year is because of the lower wheat production, Dole
said.
   The Agriculture Department estimated the government would save
$950 million in farm program payments to winter wheat growers
because wheat prices are high. The Congressional Budget Office has
said overall savings to the farm program from wheat and other crops
this year could run as high as $1.5 billion.

   The B-2 stealth bomber sped down a runway
Thursday, successfully completing its final ground test and setting
the stage for a first flight that could come as early as Saturday,
an Air Force general said.
   The sleek, bat-winged bomber raced down the runway at Air Force
Plant 42, achieving a top speed of 75 mph, said Brig. Gen. Richard
Scofield, director of the B-2 program.
   Although Scofield said the bomber's long-delayed first flight
could come Saturday, he cautioned that the Air Force is being
prudent and will not be rushed despite political controversy
harrying the bomber's progress toward full production.
   ``The plane will fly when it is ready,'' he said.
   However, Scofield said that B-2 builder Northrop Corp. and Air
Force officials believe they have all the data they need to send the
bomber airborne.
   The radar-evading bomber was tested in high winds that kicked up
clouds of dust on the 11,000-foot runway at the Air Force's prime
research and development plant in the Mojave Desert.
   During the test, the bomber's nose wheel lifted up into the air,
a procedure that was anticipated, Scofield said.
   ``It was not an aborted takeoff,'' he said.
   The bomber rolled to the end of the runway and one of its tires
became stuck in soft asphalt, making it necessary to tow it back to
its hangar.
   However, Scofield said everything went perfectly in conducting
the test as far as the Air Force was concerned.
   No first flight is anticipated Friday because the crew and the
pilots needed rest, the general said.
   The flying wing was decked out with orange highlights that were
used to cover sensors and test equipment.
   On Monday, the gray bomber built from composite materials rather
than metal conducted slow-speed tests on the ground, achieving a
speed of approximately 102 mph.
   In Washington on Thursday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney pleaded
with Congress not to ``nickel and dime to death'' the B-2, saying
the stealth bomber is essential for U.S. capability to ``penetrate
improving Soviet air defenses.''
   Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee, Cheney
urged lawmakers to try to overcome ``sticker shock'' at the $500
million to $750 million price for each plane and to restore some
$800 million the panel cut from the B-2 budget last month.
   Lawmakers warned Air Force officials earlier this week that the
B-2 faces a tough uphill fight in Congress despite the warplane's
strategic importance.
   ``Put it in perspective or there's a real possibility that the
B-2 will become a museum piece,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman
of the House Armed Services Committee, told Air Force officials at
the start of a hearing.
   The Air Force campaign comes amid growing opposition to the
bomber, which recent estimates indicate would be the most expensive
aircraft in history.
   The Pentagon announced last week the first flight tests of the
bomber, which are 18 months behind schedule, would be held during
the next two weeks.
   The Pentagon is proposing a $4.7 billion budget in fiscal 1990
for the B-2.
   The plane will cost about $24 billion over a three-year peak
period beginning in fiscal 1992, according to Defense Department
figures.
   The department has invested about $22.4 billion in the plane so
far.

<HEAD>House Wants to End Tongass Forest Timber Deals</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Changes references to ``lumber'' to timber throughout.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved environmentalist-backed
legislation Thursday that would cancel 50-year deals under which two
timber companies have been harvesting trees from Tongass National
Forest at bargain basement prices.
   The legislation, which passed 356-60, also establishes more
wilderness areas in the forest in southeastern Alaska and creates
buffer zones around many streams and tributaries to protect fish
from logging operations.
   The timber contracts have been a ``raid on the taxpayers,'' said
Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., who led debate in favor of the bill.
``We say get your hands out of our pockets.''
   ``The timber companies keep the bureaucrats employed and the
bureaucrats keep the timber companies wallowing in federal
subsidies,'' said Miller.
   ``I'm terribly disappointed,'' said Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, who
led the fight against the bill in the name of jobs for his state's
residents. ``It goes to show the influence of the environmentalist
point of view.''
   The legislation is directed at Louisiana Pacific-Ketchikan and
Alaska Pulp Co., a Japanese firm, and Young said 6,000 jobs could be
lost if the companies go out of business.
   Proponents of the bill, however, said it throws the door open to
competition from independent timber companies, owned by Alaskans,
which could create more jobs for the state population.
   ``If we cancel these contracts, it doesn't drive the timber
industry out of Alaska,'' said Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., co-sponsor of
the bill. ``It simply puts these companies on same footing as other
companies.''
   Young, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper and many members of Congress,
including Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
favored a version of the bill that would have called for
renegotiation rather than cancellation of the timber contracts. The
Agriculture Committee oversees the Forest Service, which is part of
the Agriculture Department.
   But that version, offered as an amendment, failed on a 269-144
vote.
   The bill now goes to the Senate, where Young said he expected an
outcome more to his liking. If the legislation is not changed, it
will be vetoed by President Bush, said Young.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has said he would recommend
a veto of legislation that called for termination of the contracts.
   The House bill eliminates the $40 million that now goes annually
for such activities as road-building to aid the timber companies in
Tongass and requires an amount to be set each year in the federal
budget. Proponents said that could save the government $205 million
over the next five years.
   It also would end the requirement that the government make 4.5
billion board feet of the forest's timber available each decade.
   The bill would designate 23 areas as wilderness, barring timber
harvesting and development on 1.8 million acres. The legislation
also would ban logging within 100 feet of salmon streams.
   In an effort to establish a stable economy in southeast Alaska,
Congress in 1947 authorized the Forest Service to later sign the
unprecedented 50-year contracts with timber companies. The contracts
with the two firms expire in 2004 and 2011.
   The forest is the size of West Virginia and Delaware combined and
stretches over most of Alaska's 500-mile long panhandle.
   It's one of the few remaining temperate rain forests, with an
annual precipitation of averaging 150 inches. It and the Olympic
National Park in Washington are the last remnants of a rain forest
that used to stretch from northern California to Alaska.

<TEXT>
   A tanker carrying desperately needed fuel
for Lebanon's besieged Christians broke through a Syrian blockade
Thursday, sparking heavy artillery battles in Beirut.
   Police reported three people killed and 10 wounded in shelling
duels that raged from late Wednesday night through Thursday
afternoon, further undermining cease-fire efforts by Arab League
envoys.
   Thursday's casualties raised the toll to 409 killed and 1,614
wounded since fighting erupted March 8.
   Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun hinted he might use
surface-to-surface missiles against Syria if it keeps the blockade
in place, the Mideast Mirror newsletter reported Thursday.
   Tension has risen over the reported delivery of Soviet-designed
Frog-7 missiles to Aoun's troops by Iraq. The missiles have a range
of 43 miles, enough to hit the Syrian capital of Damascus if fired
from the eastern edge of the Christian enclave.
   The Christians have never had that capability in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war.
   The London-based weekly quoted Aoun saying that ``as far as the
blockade is concerned ... there is so much one can take before an
explosion occurs.
   ``I'm not for a Frogs war with Syria, but patience has its
limits,'' Aoun was quoted as saying in the telephone interview.
   The Syrians, alarmed at the reports of the missiles, last week
tightened their naval blockade.
   However, police said the tanker that broke the blockade docked at
the port of Byblos, 19 miles north of Beirut, at noon and began
unloading its cargo, triggering a fierce Syrian bombardment.
   Christian army gunners retaliated, firing 155mm howitzers at
Syrian batteries along the seaside Ein Mreisseh boulevard in Moslem
west Beirut, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   He declined to name the tanker or say how much fuel it carried
for the 1 million Christians trapped in their 310-square-mile
enclave for 16 weeks.
   The Syrians have been trying to stop fuel, food and arms from
reaching the Christian forces led by Aoun, who also leads the
Christian half of this country's dual government.
   It was not clear how the tanker dodged Syrian gunboats patrolling
off the Christian coast. They have turned back several ships trying
to run the blockade this week.
   Several others have been sunk by Syrian shellfire.
   Three shells hit the campus of the American University of Beirut,
which overlooks Ein Mreisseh, during the night. Classes have been
suspended, and there were no casualties.
   But customers at Uncle Sam's restaurant across the street were
blown off their chairs.
   ``The whole place turned orange with the blast,'' said
photographic technician Janine Haidar.
   Beirut's Moslem sector also was rocked overnight Wednesday by
gunbattles between rival Shiite militiamen who traded hit-and-run
grenade assaults on each other's strongholds behind mortar barrages.
   No casualties were reported from the fighting that raged in the
southern slums between the Syrian-backed Amal militia and
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The hostilities ebbed into sporadic sniping at daybreak as Syrian
troops in charge of west Beirut's security sought to enforce a
cease-fire, the police spokesman said.
   Eighteen people have been killed and 51 wounded in two weeks of
sporadic street battles.
   The secular Amal and fundamentalist Hezbollah have been vying
since April 1988 to control Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the
country's largest sect. The fighting flared after several months of
relative calm.
   The artillery duels between the Syrian and Christian forces
smothered the festive mood of Moslems marking the first day of Eid
al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, which is Islam's holiest.
   Children who were setting off firecrackers fled the streets.
Packed candy stores and sidewalk cafes quickly emptied.
   The shelling underscored the failure of three Arab League envoys,
the foreign ministers of Morocco, Algeria and Saudi Arabia, to end
the war.
   The ministers have talked with Syrian President Hafez Assad in
Damascus and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in the last
few days. All three left Wednesday to spend the feast holidays in
their own countries.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe, backs Aoun and has been supplying
his estimated 20,000 troops, which are outgunned and outnumbered
4-to-1 by the Syrians and their Lebanese Moslem allies.
   Saddam seeks to thwart Syrian ambitions in Lebanon, which Assad
considers vital to his country's security, and take revenge for
Assad's support of Iran in the eight-year Persian Gulf war.
   Aoun has vowed to drive the Syrians out of Lebanon, where they
came in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.

<HEAD>Busboy Finds FBI Camera in Restaurant Favored by Politicians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A busboy who found a video camera and wire hidden
in a booth at an eatery near City Hall has blown the cover on an
apparent federal corruption probe, the restaurant's lawyer said
Thursday.
   Owners of Counselors Row Restaurant, a spot popular with
lawmakers and others with clout, were ``shocked, outraged and
extremely upset that this type of conduct exists in the United
States,'' said restaurant attorney Nicholas M. Spina.
   ``The FBI planted the listening devices, and they were discovered
by one of our busboys,'' Spina said.
   The FBI also tapped a telephone on a pedestal next to a table
often used by influential politicians, the Chicago Tribune reported,
quoting unidentified sources.
   The sophisticated, wide-angle camera with a small lens was found
Friday hidden in the base of a booth, Spina said.
   FBI spokesman Bob Long declined to comment on whether the FBI was
involved, as did U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas. The federal prosecutor
added that ``Counselors Row is not the target of any investigation.''
   Restaurant co-owner George Borovilos said that after he talked to
the FBI Tuesday, agents came to the establishment and removed the
camera. They left behind a connecting wire that ran under a seat
cushion, through a concrete wall and down into the basement of the
building, Borovilos said.
   Spina said Gary Shapiro, the federal prosecutor in charge of
organized crime investigations in Chicago, confirmed that he had
authorized planting the device.
   Shapiro has refused to comment on the case.
   A judge approved the installation of the surveillance equipment
and it was placed in the restaurant without the owners' consent,
apparently on a weekend when the place was closed, Spina said.
   ``We are awaiting word from Valukas' office to see if they'll
agree to make the sealed court order a public one,'' Spina said
Thursday.
   Spina said the camera was pointed at a table often used by
Alderman Fred Roti and Democratic ward Committeeman John D'Arco,
among other local politicians.
   Roti said in a news release, ``There is no reason for me to be
investigated, and no reason to believe that I am being
investigated.''
   He added in an interview broadcast by WGN-TV Thursday, ``I don't
like it. I'm sure a lot of other people don't like it. But whether
we like it or not, they have court jurisdiction and the right to do
it, so being angry is meaningless to me.''
   The telephone rang unanswered at D'Arco's office Thursday.
   Alderman Bernard Stone told WGN, ``It's an open restaurant. It's
an open table. When we leave at 9 o'clock, God knows who sits here.''
   Alderman Richard Mell, who also frequents the table or ones
nearby, said, ``I have no problem with (the bugs). Is it true? It
looks like a very interesting story.''

   A war hero who fought with Fidel Castro in
Cuba's revolution was executed by firing squad at dawn Thursday with
three other officers for smuggling tons of drugs into the United
States, the official Cuban news agency said.
   The drug scandal has stunned and embarrassed Castro and his
communist government, which for years denied U.S. accusations that
Cuba was being used to smuggle cocaine and marijuana to the United
States.
   In a brief dispatch monitored in Mexico City, the Cuban news
agency Prensa Latina said the sentences against Maj. Gen. Arnaldo
Ochoa, Col. Antonio de la Guardia Font, Maj. Amado Padron and Capt.
Jorge Martinez had been carried out.
   Ochoa was a trusted aide to President Castro, commanding Cuban
forces in Ethiopia and Angola and heading a Cuban military mission
to Nicaragua.
   The news agency noted that the four men, along with 10 other
officers, were convicted by a summary court-martial and that the
deliberations on their appeal were broadcast to the Cuban nation.
   Castro, who long rejected U.S. drug smuggling accusations as a
plot to defame Cuba, said Sunday the scandal had done immense
internal damage and eroded Cuba's international image.
   He called the sentences a ``bitter decision,'' but added that he
also thought about ``others who have died.''
   ``I think of those who fell to build a decent society ... to
create a republic where justice ruled, where there was no
corruption, dishonesty, fraud or treason,'' Castro told the Council
of State before it voted to affirm the death sentences.
   U.S. officials said Thursday the United States isn't convinced
Cuba is serious about combating drug trafficking, despite the
executions.
   Deputy State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the
administration has had information linking Cuba to narcotics
smuggling since 1982 and has expressed its concerns since then.
   He reacted coolly to a suggestion by Castro that the United
States and Cuba join to wage this ``common battle'' against drugs.
   ``You don't automatically start negotiating cooperation until you
have an indication the other side is really serious. And that's what
we're looking for,'' Boucher said, asserting that drug smuggling
through Cuba continues.
   The investigation, court-martial and appeal were given
unprecedented publicity aimed at showing they had a fair trial and
at erasing a stain on the honor of Cuba and the Communist Party.
   Ordinary life virtually came to a halt during televised
proceedings that began June 12. Cubans gathered around their sets in
fascination not just at the drug scandal but also because of the
scenario of unbridled greed that unfolded.
   The trial indicated that Ochoa helped smuggle tons of cocaine and
marijuana into the United States in alliance with Colombia's
Medellin cartel, the world's largest drug trafficking organization.
   The officers were also convicted of black marketeering and
smuggling diamonds, ivory, sugar, fine woods, manufactured goods and
U.S. dollars.
   All confessed guilt but asked for mercy based on their records
and contrition. Ten of the officers, including one woman, were
sentenced to terms that ranged from 10 to 30 years in prison.
   In a statement before a military court of honor that stripped the
accused of military ranks and decorations, Ochoa said he deserved to
die for betraying Castro and the revolution.
   Defense Minister Raul Castro, Fidel's brother, told an earlier
court of honor that Ochoa had been ``spreading around gifts and
handing out objects of value, mainly to officers ... in a delirious
exercise of self-indulgence, for the creation of an image and links
of gratitude to his person.''
   That seemed to imply that Ochoa was trying to bring others into
his ring. There was speculation that Ochoa was either trying to
avoid being turned in or even building his own power base, perhaps
to challenge or gain some measure of independence from the Castro
brothers, who have ruled Cuba since 1959.
   Ochoa, 57, fought in the guerrilla war that brought Castro to
power and was made a Hero of the Revolution, Cuba's highest honor,
for heading the Cuba's 50,000-man expedition in Angola and an
earlier one to Ethiopia.
   In his summation to the Council of State, made up of top
government and party officials and constituting Cuba's final court
of appeal, Castro tried to distance himself from Ochoa, citing
mistakes he made in Angola that led to battlefield defeats.
   Castro said Ochoa had concentrated on his illicit activities and
risked defeat by South African forces aiding Angolan rebels. He said
people must wonder how an officer ``so out of control'' could have
been given such responsibility.
   In addition to the officers on trial, the transportation and
interior ministers have been sacked for failing to detect and halt
the ring, according to Cuban media reports. Unconfirmed reports said
other officials were arrested.
   Castro said commuting Ochoa's sentence could create an impression
that high-ranking officials could get away with anything. Ochoa and
his cohorts ``must have felt like the most untouchable people in the
world,'' Castro said.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Test Shows No Oil Present In Slick From Valdez</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preliminary tests showed no oil in a slick from
the Exxon Valdez, the Coast Guard said Thursday, but the damaged
tanker will remain outside San Diego Bay while more tests are
conducted.
   The tests conducted by a Coast Guard laboratory conflict with the
preliminary conclusion of the state Fish and Game Department's lab.
   State officials said traces of petroleum were discovered in
samples taken from the 18-mile-long slick that developed when the
Valdez arrived off San Diego from Alaska on Monday.
   The Coast Guard test also used a sample from that slick.
   ``The results indicate no presence of oil,'' Coast Guard Cmdr.
Jack Scarborough said. ``They indicate the presence of some
unidentified organic matter.''
   A team of federal and state scientists, coordinated by a
specialist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
has been assembled to analyze fresh samples from subsequent Valdez
discharges.
   ``There are questions that have been raised relative to the
sampling procedures used by both laboratories,'' said Pete
Bontadelli, director of the state Fish and Game Department. ``That
is the reason we are establishing a single, coordinated team so we
can resolve the question once (and) for all.''
   The Valdez was towed 2,500 miles to San Diego from Alaska, where
it was responsible for the nation's worst oil spill. The vessel was
damaged March 24, when it struck a reef in Alaska's Prince William
Sound, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil.
   Coast Guard officials have barred the Valdez from entering San
Diego Bay for repairs until they are sure it poses no environmental
or navigational threat. The ship remained about 50 miles off San
Diego on Thursday.
   ``We're quite comfortable with where it is and until everyone
understands what the analysis tells us. We are in no hurry to
move,'' said Frank Iarossi, Exxon Shipping Co. president.
   Before the Valdez can enter the harbor, five steel slabs that
peeled away from its hull during the trip from Alaska must be
removed so it can navigate the shallow harbor channel. For the
safety of the divers, the salvage work must be performed in a
sheltered cove or inlet, but officials don't want to move the ship
until they determine what's being discharged.

<TEXT>
   Sidney Hook, a philosopher, author and
educator who had been a leading figure in American intellectual
circles since the late 1920s, died of congestive heart failure at
the age of 86.
   Hook died Wednesday at Stanford University Hospital.
   Since 1973, he had been a senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution and Peace on the Stanford University
campus. He took the position after retiring from New York
University, where he had taught since 1927 and had been chairman of
the philosophy department until 1968.
   Hook became a leading proponent of philosopher John Dewey's
ideals, known as pragmatism, a peculiarly American philosphy that an
idea must be judged by how it works rather than by how it looks.
Under the philosophy, an idea may be true under certain
circumstances but false under others.
   Hook first became known as a secular humanist. His first book,
``The Metaphysics of Pragmatism,'' published in 1927, was an
exposition of Dewey's thought.
   Hook became an international figure in 1933 upon publication of
``Towards the Understanding of Karl Marx,'' which was viewed as a
sympathetic interpretation of ideas of the philosophical founder of
Marxist Communism.
   Hook tried to integrate Marxism with the pragmatist philosophy
expounded by C.S. Peirce, William James and Dewey. His second book,
``From Hegel to Marx: Studies in the Intellectual Development of
Karl Marx,'' published in 1936, is a scholastic classic, considered
one of the best critical expositions of Marxism ever by an American
philosopher.
   Hook never joined the Communist Party and rejected the idea that
the attainment of socialism or a planned economy could or should be
accomplished by sacrificing democratic ideals and institutions.
   His best-known work, ``The Hero in History,'' published in 1943,
is still widely used in college classrooms.
   In 1951, Hook founded the American Committee for Cultural
Freedom. He was an early critic of Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, a
controversial Republican who charged that communists had infiltrated
the U.S. government.
   Hook expounded his views on issues of that era in two books, one
titled, ``Heresy, Yes _ Conspiracy, No!''
   He was born in New York City on December 20, 1902. He graduated
from City College of New York in 1923, earned a master's degree at
Columbia University in 1926 and received a doctorate from Columbia
in 1927.
   He is survived by his wife, Ann, two sons and a daughter.

   An underwater volcano erupted Thursday off central
Japan, spewing plumes of smoke and ash into the air and creating
tremors that shook the Izu peninsula.
   There were no reports of injuries or damage, but callers jammed
telephone lines for hours after the eruption a mile off the coast of
Ito city, a seaside resort 62 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Hundreds of Ito's 72,000 residents fled, and city officials were
considering evacuating people living near the shore, according to
the Japan Broadcasting Corp. The Central Meteorological Agency
issued a navigation warning to ships in the area.
   The volcano erupted at 6:30 p.m. on the ocean floor at a depth of
330 feet, the Meteorological Agency said. Officials said earlier it
occurred at a depth of up to about 1,000 feet.
   ``Right now, we don't know if this will lead to another, larger
eruption and can only tell people there to watch for further
warnings,'' said an agency official. ``Obviously, there could be
danger to Ito if a larger eruption occurs,'' he said, requesting
anonymity.
   The Japanese archipelago is of volcanic origin, and 80 volcanoes
are believed to be active.
   For hours after the eruption, calls to the Ito Police Department
and City Hall were met with recorded messages asking callers to try
later due to ``extremely crowded lines.''
   Along with the strong jolt of the eruption, slight tremors,
possibly caused by the volcano, were felt throughout the evening,
said the official from the Meteorological Agency.
   Seismologists were surveying movements of underground magma in
the area. Large movements of magma can cause earthquakes, which
often preceed volcanic eruptions.
   More than 20,000 earthquakes have been recorded around Izu over
the past two weeks.
   An official of the Seismic Division of the Central Meteorological
Agency, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the nature of the
quakes had changed since Tuesday night, with the most recent quakes
occurring more frequently and lasting up to 20 seconds.
   On Wednesday, there were eight such temblors recorded, he said.
   Between June 30 and noon Thursday, 22,328 temblors were recorded
off the Izu peninsula, the Central Meteorological Agency said. Most
were at depths of two to 4.5 miles under the sea.
   Twenty-one people suffered minor injuries when two earthquakes
registering 5.5 on the Richter scale hit Ito on Sunday.

<HEAD>Gun Dealer Selling Weapons Reportedly Tied to Sniper</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A gun dealer is offering for sale seven
guns purportedly used by a sniper when he shot and killed 14 people
from the top of a University of Texas tower in 1966.
   The three rifles, one shotgun and three pistols are said to be
the ones used in the attack by Charles Whitman. In all, Whitman
killed 16 people and wounded 31 others. He killed his mother and his
wife before climbing the 307-foot tower in the center of the Austin
campus, where he was a student.
   Police stormed the tower and killed Whitman, 25.
   Austin Police Capt. Robert Gross said Thursday that the guns used
in the attack were turned over to Whitman's estate and were later
sold at auction.
   The guns have been advertised by Wayne Buxton in the past three
issues of a gun collectors' publication, the Austin
American-Statesman and the Houston Chronicle reported Thursday.
   The American-Statesman said Buxton instructed editors of
``Shotgun News'' not to divulge his name or phone number to callers.
The newspaper said it linked the post office box number given in the
classified ad to Buxton, who owns a gun and pawn shop in the Dallas
suburb of Garland.
   Buxton did not return telephone calls Thursday to his home and
shop from The Associated Press.
   The gun dealer told the newspapers he doesn't want to discuss
what the ads call The Whitman Colection because ``there's too much
pain in the state of Texas'' associated with the slayings.
   ``I have no interest whatsoever in resurrecting pain or any sad
feelings,'' he said. ``It's a source of pain to certain people, and
I don't want to get into that.''
   The Chronicle said Buxton, who is seeking $7,500 for the
collection, would not say how he obtained the weapons, but claims
they are authentic. He said he is not a Whitman relative.
   KDFW-TV in Dallas said Buxton told the station he does not own
the weapons, but is acting as the agent for the owner, whom he would
not identify.
   The ad offers the guns, a radio, binoculars, cameras and a knife
for money or in trade for historical Winchester rifles or Colt
pistols, the Chronicle said. The ad also offers a copy of a 1966
Life magazine reporting the slaughter.

   Leaders of the world's seven major industrial
democracies gather in Paris on Friday for their 15th annual economic
summit, surrounded by France's bicentennial hoopla and with a
comfortable sense of economic self-satisfaction.
   The oil crises, inflationary pressures, monetary instability and
other woes that dominated previous summits seem contained, giving
the government leaders time to take an unhurried look at matters
such as the environment and Third World debt.
   The surge in the dollar that started in June, sending economic
shivers down the backs of many a government official, has been
cooled after massive intervention by central banks selling dollars.
   An optimistic U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady emphasized
the Western economies are doing well and the coordination process
among the seven _ the United States, Canada, Japan, West Germany,
France, Italy and Britain _ is working. There is no need for
tinkering during the three-day summit beginning Friday, he said.

   A suspended Roman Catholic priest is rejecting
a call by a group of black bishops that he abandon his unsanctioned
African-American Catholic congregation.
   ``The people have spoken,'' the Rev. George A. Stallings Jr.,
said Wednesday, citing the number of people who attended the first
two weeks of services at his Imani Temple.
   Stallings told The Washington Post the bishops' statement was
``predictable'' and said they ``opted for office and position over
their ability to exercise a prophetic voice'' in the leadership of
the church's nearly 2 million black members.
   The bishops, in a statement, said Stallings ``possesses the
vibrancy of our culture and spiritual heritage,'' but should make
those changes within the church.
   ``We implore him to return to the unity of the church,'' the
bishops said, ``and to continue to urge reform ... within the unity
of the one Catholic church.''

   The Soviet Union is still hospitalizing
citizens who are not mentally ill, says a team of U.S. health
experts who recommend additional reforms to prevent confinement of
political dissidents.
   The 26-member delegation's report, released Wednesday, said broad
concepts of ``social dangerousness'' have contributed to the Soviet
practice of hospitalizing people who are not mentally ill.
   In response, the Soviet side expressed disagreement with some
aspects of the study, but nonetheless called it a ``valuable and
useful document.''
   The delegation visited the Soviet Union from Feb. 26 to March 12
to assess recent changes in Soviet psychiatry. They examined 15
patients and 12 former patients who had been released within the

   This is not another one of those jokes
about New Jersey. It is about a museum filled with garbage.
   The Hackensack Meadowlands Environment Center's museum will
feature windows, tires, bottles, paper cartons and toys once
destined for landfills in New Jersey, which produces 26,000 tons of
trash daily _ enough to fill nearby Giants Stadium to the top of the
scoreboard every 2{ weeks.
   ``The fundamental purpose is educational. We want to show people
that garbage doesn't just disappear. That it's not just by magic,''
said Robert Grant, a spokesman for the center.
   The plans for the museum come at a time when communities across
the nation are considering ways to recycle some of their trash. A
third of the country's 6,000 dumps will close during in the next
five years, driving up disposal costs.

   The rehearsal room fills with British accents as
actors break for lunch after spending a recent morning trying to
sound as American as apple pie.
   It's all in a day's work at the Royal Shakespeare Company, which
is reviving the classic 1939 American comedy ``The Man Who Came to
Dinner,'' by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart.
   The RSC had a 1979 hit with Trevor Nunn's production of Kaufman
and Hart's ``Once in a Lifetime,'' which went on to a commercial
West End run. ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' opens at the Barbican
Theater on July 20, and runs in repertory through September 12.
   ``This play is superlatively well put together. With any luck,
it's one of those wonderful comic machines,'' said John Wood, the
Englishman who plays the irascible dinner guest, Sheridan Whiteside.
   The supporting cast includes such RSC stalwarts as Richard Haddon
Haines and Marjorie Yates as Whiteside's hosts, the Stanleys, and
Ralph Fiennes as the local newspaperman, Bert Jefferson.
   Whiteside, a wicked caricature of the celebrated wit and theater
critic Alexander Woollcott, is a New York radio celebrity who ends
up housebound with an Ohio family when a dinner invitation becomes a
comedy of misadventures.
   Monty Woolley originated the part in New York and in the 1941
film, and Robert Morley was its first London star. Morley's son,
theater critic Sheridan Morley, was born that year, and was named
after Sheridan Whiteside.
   The play is ripe with Whiteside's acid-tongued lines:
   _ Whiteside in introducing his secretary to Bert Jefferson:
``This aging debutante, Mr. Jefferson, I retain in my employ only
because she is the sole support of her two-headed brother.''
   The play was most recently seen in New York in 1980 at Circle in
the Square, directed by and starring Ellis Rabb.
   The latest revival marks the RSC directing debut of Broadway
veteran Gene Saks, who is most often associated with the plays of
Neil Simon. His staging of Simon's farce, ``Rumors,'' is a current
Broadway hit.
   Saks had only worked in London once before, restaging his
Broadway musical hit ``I Love My Wife'' for the West End, when the
RSC approached him.
   ``I found this offer very flattering,'' said Saks in an
interview. ``They said, `We wanted an American to do it and who
knows more about American comedy than you do?' I said, `Well, now
I'll have to do it.'''
   Saks came to London in March to meet with John Wood, whom he knew
socially during Wood's longtime residency in New York starring in
``Deathtrap,'' ``Travesties'' and ``Amadeus.''
   He called Wood ``a very special, tremendously talented and
experienced actor who can teach anybody a lot.''
   Wood stars as Prospero in ``The Tempest'' at the RSC, and will
play the doomed Halvard Solness in Henrik Ibsen's ``The Master
Builder,'' opening there Sept. 26.
   The actor said he responded with some diffidence to the offer to
play Whiteside, adding that the role's unusual demands require a
masseur.
   Whiteside is wheelchair-bound for much of the play, having
slipped and broken his hip. ``This is lower backpain on an operatic
scale,'' said Wood.
   Saks liked the lesser pressures and diminished intensity of
working at the RSC, where shows are guaranteed a run, as opposed to
New York, where they can close overnight.
   ``I'm always shocked at the reaction of the (New York) press and
of some of the public,'' said Saks, who, besides his string of Neil
Simon hits, directed two recent Broadway flops: Bob Larbey's play
``A Month of Sundays,'' and the musical ``Rags.''
   ``I want to say, `It's after all only a play. If you didn't like
it, that's your prerogative, but let's go on to the next one.'''
   Instead, New York failures are, he said, ``left like a street
accident with blood all over them.''
   The RSC reminded Saks of the Actors' Studio, where he trained as
an actor in the 1940s.
   ``There's a real revolution against phony, traditional acting,''
he said. ``They all seem to want to be truthful and get underneath
things, the same as good actors are doing in America.
   ``There's less and less difference between the two.''

   A new world is coming in which people
will behave like fish, predicts Jackson Hlungwane, a self-made
preacher and perhaps South Africa's most significant sculptor.
   ``Fish shine. They're peaceful. They don't fight with
everything,'' Hlungwane said in an interview, wiggling his hips to
show how fish move smoothly through water.
   Massive carved fish lie on the earth, amid chickens and barefoot
children in Mbhokota, Hlungwane's village near Elim, in the
northeastern black homeland of Gazankulu. More of the sculptor's
fish rest among the black art collection at the prestigious
University of the Witwatersrand.
   In August, Hlungwane will have his first one-man show in
Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city. The works of this
unschooled former laborer command thousands of dollars in the
white-controlled world of galleries and art connoisseurs.
   The Weekly Mail newspaper called him ``one of the real innocents
among the rural carvers.''
   ``He's unself-conscious, a visionary who happens to be an
artist,'' said painter Ricky Burnett, one of a committee of friends
formed to manage Hlungwane's funds and artistic career, and who is
organizing the August exhibit.
   ``He's probably the most important sculptor in the country. The
content of his work points to peace, freedom and ethical values,
like love.''
   Visitors to Mbhokota may find Hlungwane in a field, digging holes
for the foundation of a new house of worship for women. Men who
belong to the sculptor's ``One Galileo Christ Alpha and Omega
Church'' worship higher up a hill, at a site called Jerusalem. He
preaches twice a week.
   Hlungwane says religion and art are the same thing. ``I do the
work of God by carving,'' he said. ``Art comes from all my body.''
   He prefers to talk about his apocalyptic vision of sin and strife
being replaced by brotherhood, and about peace in racially divided
South Africa.
   ``When you go up (to heaven) in the big smoke, you must carry
everything you've done and show God,'' he said. ``It is better to
negotiate than to kill. Whites must stop the gun and blacks must
stop the club.''
   Collectors value Hlungwane's work for its form, as well as its
meaning. The Jerusalem site contains skillfully shaped figures of
Cain, Abel, the angel Gabriel and Christ. A tall pole bears
automobile lights and reflectors, crosses and a representation of
the Holy Ghost.
   The pieces, cut from large limbs found in nearby forests, are
unprotected. They turn gray and crack in wind and rain. Nearby lies
a huge tree trunk from which Hlungwane is carving a figure of Adam.
   ``There are touches of Japan and South America in his work. He
has a feel for nature and observes it closely,'' Burnett said.
   Hlungwane is vague about the details of his life. The son of a
miner, he is about 66, married with 12 children. He quit work after
losing a finger in an industrial accident, declaring that any
machine that could take a finger would wind up taking an arm.
   ``I don't take money; money is trouble. I want your heart,''
Hlungwane tells visitors. ``When you have given me your heart, you
have paid me.''
   After people took him at his word and began carrying off
sculptures without paying for them, Burnett and others in the
Johannesburg art world formed a management committee for Hlungwane.
   Near the village is a riverbank where Hlungwane once buried deep
in the earth a life-size carving of a horse. He later spent days in
an unsuccessful search to retrieve the sculpture.
   Near the river is a hill where Hlungwane has dug foundation holes
for a new and different project _ a gasoline station and hotel.
Members of his management committee are puzzled, but Hlungwane has
no doubts.
   ``The garage and Jerusalem are the same thing,'' he said.
``Jerusalem is the center of the whole world. And all routes go by
this garage, from Zimbabwe, Zululand and Johannesburg.''

<HEAD>North Carolina Growing Fast in Movie Industry</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   This is another in occasional series of articles
on the proliferation of moviemaking outside Hollywood. Tempted by
friendly officials eager to please, filmmakers are flocking to
out-of-state locations, spending billions of dollars that once would
have stayed in California.

<DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stars are hanging out in North Carolina,
and they're not just in the sky.
   Projects featuring such movie actors as Faye Dunaway, Robert
Duvall, Natasha Richardson, Debra Winger and Nick Nolte are
solidifying North Carolina as a hotbed for moviemaking.
   ``They're major caliber people and major caliber projects. Both
of those are looking at Academy Award-type situations,'' said Bill
Arnold, director of the North Carolina Film Commission.
   In the past few months, two movies with those actors have been
shooting in North Carolina: ``The Handmaid's Tale'' in Raleigh and
Durham, and ``Everybody Wins'' in Wilmington.
   ``I think we started out with major films and higher caliber
pictures than had been the general rule in the South,'' Arnold said.
   Starting with such movies as ``Being There,'' starring Peter
Sellers, in 1979 and ``Brainstorm,'' starring Natalie Wood, in 1983,
North Carolina has also made Steven Spielberg's ``The Color
Purple,'' ``The Year of the Dragon'' and many others.
   North Carolina is one of the fastest growing moviemaking
locations in the country, and is second to California in the number
of sound stages and studios, Arnold said, with 18 sound stages and
four studios with plans for a fifth.
   ``We also have the largest resident work force of crew and
technical people on the East Coast, after New York,'' he said.
   Still, even though 42 states have film offices and actively
compete for business, California remains the film leader of the
United States, with New York close at its heels.
   Though not always cheaper, it's easier to make a movie outside
California. One-stop, state-controlled film offices are preferred to
California's patchwork approach, where local governments issue
permits with fluctuating fees and have requirements that are 70
years old.
   And the long-held belief that Hollywood could re-create anything
from the Tara plantation in ``Gone With the Wind'' to the Las Vegas
Strip in ``One From the Heart'' has been abandoned by filmmakers who
want greater realism.
   North Carolina's moderate climate and diverse landscape are
attractive to Hollywood producers.
   ``It's the best,'' said Michael Stroud, location manager for
``The Handmaid's Tale.''
   ``Everyone makes it so easy for you, and the bureaucracy is nil.
This really is the ideal place to film _ I think the South, in
general.''
   The movies ``Bull Durham,'' a delightful romp about life in minor
league baseball, and ``Winter People,'' a drama about intense
relations starring Kelly McGillis were both filmed in 1987.
   ```Winter People' is a depression-era, very cold, snowy film.
`Bull Durham' is just the opposite,'' Arnold said. ``But they were
both shot in November and they both got what they want.''
   Since North Carolina can offer a variety of ``looks,'' film
company have fewer location moves.
   ``The Handmaid's Tale,'' which is being filmed entirely in the
state, needed seasonal changes and also the look of a New England
college, which it found at Duke University. Based on the acclaimed
novel by Margaret Atwood, the book is a daring move into the future
and tells the tale of what happens after a right-wing religious
revolution has swept America, imposing a dictatorial regime and
ruthlessly executing any dissenters.
   In 1982, the science-fiction movie ``Brainstorm'' filmed in six
different locations without leaving North Carolina.
   Lake Lure in the North Carolina mountains served as the backdrop
for much of the musical ``Dirty Dancing,'' which Arnold calls one of
the most successful made in the state.
   ``It cost them (Vestron Pictures) $2.3 million to shoot that
here,'' Arnold said. ``They've been back here twice since. That
movie has generated more than $750 million. That's a tremendous
return. That's the kind of thing that really sells the state.''
   North Carolina's return also has been tremendous.
   Since the state's film office was established in 1980, it has
spent only $1.05 million to attract moviemakers _ none of it on
advertising like many states do, such as Texas, Ohio, Massachusetts
and Pennsylvania. Arkansas even offered a 5 percent rebate.
   ``The film industry is really very small,'' Arnold said. ``If
North Carolina is a good place to shoot, everybody will know it. We
have put our emphasis on making sure the people who come here get
what they were promised they'd get.''
   Films, TV movies, commercials and videos have pumped $1.6 billion
into the North Carolina economy over the past nine years, including
$297 million generated by 19 productions in 1988.
   Producers say they can make a movie cheaper in North Carolina _ a
right to work state _ partly because they have a choice of whether
to use union or non-union actors and technicians.
   Money can be saved by hiring non-union extras for movies with
large casts, but many films made outside California use union crews
because their Hollywood-based production companies must honor
contracts with talent and craft unions. ``The cost of an average
movie in Hollywood is $18 million,'' Arnold said. ``Dino De
Laurentiis (whose studio was based in North Carolina) two years ago
said the average cost in North Carolina is $9 million.
   ``It has grown at a rate that it's been comfortable for the state
to accommodate. It's been very beneficial.''
   The economic impact is mostly indirect, through money film
companies spend on hotels, food, supplies, equipment and location
fees.
   When Stephen King's ``Firestarter'' was filming in 1983, Orton
Plantation in Wilmington was used as major location.
   ``They needed to burn that to the ground in a final scene,''
Arnold said. ``What they had to do was re-create the facade, and
they spent $80,000 ... to burn it in one whack.''
   A service station operator pumped $6,000 worth of gas in one day
for production company trucks and cars when ``Brainstorm'' was being
shot.
   The direct impact, though, comes by way of income taxes.
   The movies made in North Carolina have created 53,000 jobs,
including actors, extras, crew people and drivers.
   ``Basically, a film company will come into a community and drop
literally millions of dollars _ it's a great economic boost,''
Stroud said.
   ``You don't have to go out and browbeat a community to get
involved,'' said Arnold. ``In general, the citizens are very excited
about making movies.''

<HEAD>Animated `Simpsons' Moving to Own Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Matt Groening had been asked to pitch ideas
for an animated television show before, but network executives
didn't quite get it.
   ``They would say, what do you want to do?'' Groening recalled,
``and I'd say, I want a show with the wit and charm of `Bullwinkle.'
And they'd say, you don't understand, we're trying to appeal to
3-year-olds. I'd say, I do a cartoon called `Life in Hell'. Why did
you want to talk to me?''
   Producer-director James L. Brooks (``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,''
``Broadcast News'') knew exactly what Groening's ``Life in Hell''
cartoon was all about.
   The strip is carried by ``alternative'' weekly newspapers around
the country, such as The Village Voice. Brooks asked Groening to
create the brief ``bumpers,'' cartoon vignettes, that lead in and
out of commercials during ``The Tracey Ullman Show,'' of which
Brooks is executive producer.
   The Simpsons, a homely, squabbling brood of Middle-Americans,
became such a hit on ``Ullman,'' Fox is spinning them off into their
own series.
   Fox won't yet say when, but sometime during the next season,
Tracey Ullman and company will bid adieu to the Simpsons, the week
before they embark on their own show. It will be the first
prime-time, network animated series since ``The Jetsons'' and ``The
Flintstones'' in the 1960s.
   ``The Simpsons'' is set in the mythical Midwestern city of
Springfield, a burg replete with a nuclear power plant and a toxic
waste dump.
   The voices of Homer, Marge and their kids, Lisa, Bart and Maggie,
are provided by Dan Castellanata and Julie Kavner, both of ``The
Tracey Ullman Show,'' Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith and celebrity
guest voices, such as Harry Shearer and Penny Marshall.
   Brooks, Groening and producer-writer Sam Simon told a meeting of
television critics that they just don't know what America will think
of the Simpsons once audiences start getting a bigger dose of their
darkly funny sitcom antics.
   Someone wondered whether America was in fact receiving enough
cutting satire of sitcom families in Fox's ``Married ... With
Children.'' Simon insisted, almost maintaining a straight face, that
the Simpsons are unlike the unscrupulous and conniving Bundys and
really do love each other, deep down.
   ``They don't hate each other,'' Simon said. ``If they do
occasionally strangle each other or hit each other over the head,
it's just an impulsive act.''
   ``Whether they will go over, whether these drawn figures will go
over, we don't know,'' Brooks said.
   The Simpsons, who look very much like the wild-eyed rabbits who
populate Groening's ``Life in Hell'' strip, derived from an
``unpublishable novel'' Groening said he wrote in high school,
``Mean Kids.''
   Groening said he never expected to become a cartoonist, since
``my drawing didn't improve much after sixth grade.'' He describes
the Simpsons as having ``large, round eyes, and a tremendous
overbite problem'' _ basically, his rabbits without the giant ears.
``Maybe someday Marge will take off a wig and reveal her true
identity,'' he teased.
   Groening said he does fervently hope that Binky and the other
rabbits from ``Life in Hell'' might get their own TV series, too,
someday.
   ``Someday,'' Groening said, ``maybe television will be ready for
my hellish stuff.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   `COPS' IN RUSSIA _ Fox's reality-based ``COPS'' went on location
to the Soviet Union earlier this year, and the resulting special,
``COPS in Russia,'' airs Saturday. Three American and three Soviet
camera crews followed the Soviet police as they went about their
patrols in Moscow and Leningrad.
   The one-hour special includes Soviet police investigations of
homicides, suicides, black marketing, domestic disputes and drug
offenses.
   ``We were incredibly pleased with the openness and cooperation
that the government displayed in welcoming us to ride along with
their police,'' said Stephen Chao, vice president of Fox television
stations.
   ``People will be amazed at the similarities, and differences,

<HEAD>Capital Gains Tax Cut: Dead or Alive?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While President Bush still supports a cut in the
capital gains tax rate, the chances of it occurring this year have
dimmed, largely because it got caught up in politics.
   Opposition to a cut, which would have made it financially less
costly to sell stocks that have risen in value, was largely based on
fears among elected officials that the public would view a cut as a
gift to the rich.
   Lost amid the concern were such arguments that a cut might
actually raise federal revenues, helping to lower the deficit; that
it might be fairer, and that it might encourage business formations
and the creation of jobs.
   True or false, the ``gift to the rich'' brand, promoted by
opponents of a cut, is a brand that could harass an elected official
for the rest of his or her political days, which could be brief if
voters took it to heart.
   True, it might help the rich, but true also is the assertion that
it might help the less-than-rich, as Professor Lawrence Lindsey of
Harvard University indicated in testimoney before the House Ways and
Means Committee.
   Suppose, he said, that 20 years ago you managed to buy one unit
of the Dow Jones industrial average, which at the time was selling
for about $900. A small investment, to be sure, but one that grew to
a high of $2,700 in 1987.
   You would have an $1,800 capital gain, which might seem to be a
compliment to your great patience and your ability to withstand the
risk of violent market ups and downs. Then you figure the tax: state
and federal, roughly one-third.
   Quite a belt, but that isn't even the tough part. Even tougher to
digest is the realization that an enormous amount of that is simply
inflation. Inflation is bad enough, but you might conclude that to
be taxed on it is insulting.
   The fact of the matter is you would have come out a loser _ not a
gainer _ for your risk-taking and patience. Economist Lindsey points
out that for you to have merely broken even you would have had to
sell at $3,000, not $2,700.
   That, of course, would have been impossible, since the Dow Jones
industrial average has never in its history reached that level,
having plunged right after reaching 2,700 points. It is now around
2,500 points.
   Drowned out by the gift-to-the-rich contention is the assertion
that a cut would raise federal revenues by billions of dollars a
year. The thesis is backed by various studies, but most convincingly
by history, since a capital gains tax reduction in 1979 was followed
by a sharp increase in revenue.
   Not everyone agrees that a cut would increase revenues year after
year. Some critics say the impact might be felt mainly in the first
year or two, when investors with long-term gains would be enticed
into cashing in their assets.
   And, in fact, Joseph Minarik of the Urban Institute argues, ``the
history of the last decade is not favorable to the claims of revenue
raising through capital gains tax cuts.''
   But, while Congress and academics argued about the numbers, the
thesis was never shot down, i.e., proven without any doubt to be
incorrect.
   Instead, the lure of extra billions of dollars in revenues, even
by a Congress desperately searching for ways to close the budget
gap, just wasn't strong enough to withstand the political damage of
a gift to the rich.
   In theory, anyway, a capital gains tax might also lead to higher
federal revenues in an entirely different way, by spurring investors
and entrepreneurs into forming new businesses which, if they grow,
become taxpayers.
   But, unless Congress has a change of heart, such a cut is not
destined to be passed this year _ for rich investors or ordinary
folks such as those who buy mutual funds.

<HEAD>Couple Educated Two Teen Sons in the Ways of Violent Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT LEISNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like a lot of couples, Matthew and Pamela
Schultz taught their teen-age sons the family business. It wasn't
your typical Mom-and-Pop operation _ the Schultzes were into robbery.
   For William, 16, and Matt, 15, the tools of the trade were
AK-47s, police scanners, surveillance and survival gear, maps, wigs,
even hypnosis, police say. They were trained in hand-to-hand combat,
went through daily routines of jogging, situps and pushups, and
memorized streets, zones and police codes.
   There were dry runs and days of scrupulously logging police
movement.
   Files police found in a rented home near Sarasota included
blueprint-like drawings and maps showing distances to police and
fire stations, hospitals, malls, railroad terminals and streets
leading to interstate highways.
   After a job, the two teens would be hypnotized and debriefed.
   ``Some sessions were more detailed than others,'' said Detective
Bob Drone in Kenneth City, 50 miles north of Sarasota. ``The reason
was if any mistakes were made during a robbery they could be
corrected before the next one.''
   One mistake the Schultzes made cost them; they pleaded guilty in
Tennessee to a botched robbery and drew a 10-year prison sentence.
   Documents police found in the house left no doubt the Schultzes
thought of it as a business. There were ledger entries for
expenditures. A contract dealt with firearm purchases, handling of
loot, and standards of behavior.
   ``No greed will be tolerated for personal use and pleasure,'' it
warned, according to investigators.
   Police don't know much about the family. Schultz, 29, was at one
time a trucker. His 35-year-old wife was a onetime exotic dancer and
was married to a Rochester, N.Y., man named Hinton, who fathered the
boys and since has died.
   The Schultzes told their landlady, Stella Penney, they were Matt
and Pat Avery last September when they rented the three-bedroom
country home she owned on 10 acres near Sarasota. They said they'd
be there two years.
   Schultz told Mrs. Penney he was a Marine on special assignment at
MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, 70 miles away. ``I wasn't
suspicious. I didn't know they were criminals,'' she said, adding
that the boys were polite, but didn't seem to go to school and
dressed mostly in military clothes.
   Over the months, Mrs. Penney grew wary of Mrs. Schultz, who
demanded several days' notice before the landlady could visit, then
was rude to her. ``I was getting kind of scared of her. The others
would come around and apologize, make excuses for her that she was
having a bad day or the like.''
   The first police knew of the Schultzes was a six-month spree of
robberies and burglaries that began in the Sarasota area in May
1988. On Nov. 26, the Schultzes sat outside a Kenneth City
restaurant while the two teens and a runaway they had picked up took
$3,000-$4,000 at gunpoint, Drone said.
   On Dec. 1, Mrs. Penney got the November rent. ``Matt opened his
wallet and I saw a stack of big bills, two inches thick. It was
loaded; there were hundreds. I said, `What did you do, rob a bank?'
''
   Schultz said no, then told her he was going to Tampa on business
and would be back in a few weeks. But the family fled.
   ``It looked like they got out in a hurry,'' Mrs. Penney said.
They left behind two big dogs, their clothes and a $300 electric
bill.
   Gone were the stove, dining room table and fans, and the carpet
was ruined. One bedroom was painted in military camouflage colors. A
barrel on the wooded lot had been used for target practice and
looked like swiss cheese. Shots had been fired into the barn. Empty
ammunition shells were scattered around and there were three
homemade obstacle courses in the front yard.
   Scared by a local crime-reenactment TV show, the Schultzes headed
home to Churchville, N.Y., starting back south in January or
February, police say.
   They made it as far as Red Bank, Tenn., outside Chattanooga,
where police nabbed the two Schultz boys and a runaway from New York
after the botched armed robbery of a businessman as he made a night
deposit, said Sgt. Dan Dyer.
   Police recovered all but $110 of the $1,180 cash and $300 in
checks. Some was stashed in a motel light globe and $300 was in a
refrigerator drip tray, he said. ``The light globe had been lined
with tissue paper so the money was not visible even when you shined
a flashlight on it. Some of the stuff was ingenious.''
   Police confiscated an AK-47 and 750 rounds of ammunition, a
.45-caliber pistol with 130 rounds, an automatic rifle with 300
rounds, magazine clips and a number of military-type knives, Dyer
said. ``They had enough weapons and ammo to keep us held off the
better part of a week.''
   The Schultzes pleaded guilty last month to the robbery. A judge
sentenced the adults to 10 years to run concurrently with any
sentence in Florida. The boys' unspecified sentence is to be
parallel and concurrent to Florida's.
   The family was extradited last month and pleaded innocent July 7
to charges stemming from three shoe-store robberies, one each at a
computer software store and a yogurt shop, and burglaries of a
restaurant and three schools.
   Matthew and Pamela Schultz and William Hinton, now 17, face 24
counts each of conspiracy, robbery with a firearm, burglary and
grand theft. Each is being held on nearly $500,000 bond. Matt Hinton
was indicted by a grand jury on 19 counts as an adult and is being
held on $200,000 bond.
   They are to be tried Oct. 23.
   Police traced the family to the rented home and found shotguns,
ammunition and 60 pounds of spent shells. They also seized a
three-inch-thick file giving more than a glimpse into the carefully
orchestrated, resourceful operation that included runaways the
adults brought into the fold.
   The contract they found reads in part:
   ``Any and all firearms will be bought by the business and held by
the overseer for proper use.'' Stolen money would be ``cleaned and
unmarked by overseer Matt.'' Big expenditures ``would not be allowed
in one lump sum as it might be traced back.'' Anyone who took drugs
or alcohol within seven days of a job would be excluded. Traceable
items had to be destroyed.
   There also were individual's notes: ``three days ago, stopped
smoking ... you can beat anybody but Matthew ... you are smart,
smarter than the cops ... you feel no pain ... won't remember being
hypnotized.''
   Jobs were carefully planned. For a grocery store stickup, they
figured 20 seconds to open the safe, 15 seconds to grab the money,
10 to get out followed by a 100-yard dash. Police were two-fifths of
a mile away. They had 36 seconds to run half the driveway with maybe
12 stacks of money totaling 20-30 pounds.
   ``They were big on changing appearances for different jobs,''
Drone said, changing hair style and color, even dressing the boys as
girls. ``Here were parental figures training kids to commit violent
crimes. The biggest travesty is the effect on these kids probably
for the rests of their lives.''
   ``They used their kids,'' said Sarasota Sheriff's Dept. spokesman
Cpl. Mike Bessette. ``That's the most unfortunate thing. The saddest
and sickest part of this whole thing is that the actual victims here
are the kids.''

   While America marks the 20th
anniversary of man's landing on the moon, NASA has on its wish list
a permanent scientific lunar outpost early next century.
   When astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot in the
lunar dust July 20, 1969, some scientists saw it as a logical step
toward building a research base there.
   But no overwhelming public or political support developed for
such an expensive undertaking, and blueprints were shelved.
   Some scientists continued through the years to yearn for a moon
base. Mineral-rich lunar soil could support crops grown under
pressurized domes, researchers say, and a commercially valuable gas,
prevalent on the moon, could be returned to Earth where it is rare.
   The scientists have a glimmer of hope in a document released last
December by NASA's Office of Exploration, ``Beyond Earth's Horizons
_ Human Exploration of the Solar System in the 21st Century.'' It
outlined possibilities for two moon bases among four potential
manned expeditions. The other two involve flights to the Martian
moon Phobos and to Mars itself.
   One of the moon bases envisioned would not be permanently
staffed. It would serve chiefly as an astronomy laboratory where
telescopes, free of the Earth's obscuring atmosphere and interfering
electronic transmissions, could study the most distant radioemitting
galaxies and search for extraterrestrial life.
   The exploration office plan puts this unmanned base on the moon's
far side, which is permanently hidden from Earth. Each of four
successive four-person crews would work through a 14-day lunar day,
setting up equipment delivered by unmanned cargo vehicles, before
returning to Earth or an orbiting space station as a 14-day night
begins. Staying through a frigid lunar night would require
considerable extra support equipment.
   Once the observatory is built the telescopes would operate
automatically, sending images and data to Earth through a satellite
orbiting the moon, or the ground could direct them to look at
certain celestial objects.
   Astronauts would return to the base every three years to service
the equipment and to collect and replace telescope film.
   The second base, on the front side of the moon, would be
permanently manned.
   Many astronaut crews over several years would be required to
construct an Antarctic-type facility, using raw building materials
already there. The Apollo missions disclosed that every shovelful of
lunar soil is rich in metals and silicon and that this soil can be
mixed with water to form a type of cement.
   Oxygen is the most abundant element on the moon, and this can be
combined with hydrogen to make water. Because oxygen is five-sixths
of what rocket engines burn, the base could also serve as a tank
farm for spacecraft flying between Earth and the moon or embarking
for Mars or elsewhere in the solar system.
   A lunar resource of potentially great commercial value is
helium-3, an isotope of helium with one neutron and two protons,
instead of the two neutrons and two protons in ordinary helium.
Physicists see it as a cleaner, more efficient alternative to the
fuels foreseen for conventional fusion reactors to generate
electrical power.
   On Earth, helium-3 exists only in very small quantities as a
by-product of nuclear weapons production. But on the moon it is
abundant, deposited by the sun's charged particles.
   Studies done by the Fusion Technology Institute at the University
of Wisconsin and NASA indicate that as little as 40,000 pounds of
helium-3 could be transported to Earth on just two lunar return
trips. Used in a national array of fusion reactors, this amount
could supply the energy needs of the United States for a year.
   The exploration office study says either or both moon bases could
be started early in the next century. The report did not include
expedition costs, but Frank Martin, chief of the office, said,
``It's clear that in order to do these things you are going to have
to spend more money, a larger percentage of the federal budget.''

   To work or not to work? The question never
comes up in Japan, where school is considered the only job fit for
students.
   But American teen-agers are working in droves, much of their cash
going for cars, clothes, beer and sometimes drugs. They are perhaps
learning the work ethic. But they are also learning conspicuous
consumption, and some critics say they are compromising their
education as well.
   When she was named National Teacher of the Year last April, Mary
Bicouvaris singled out working students and asked them to put a
priority on school. ``They are very busy people,'' she said. ``What
I find deplorable many times is they work school into the business
schedule rather than fit business into the school schedule.''
   Most studies have shown little or no effect on school performance
if students keep their work time to 20 hours a week. But the studies
are based on averages that don't apply to individual students. Plus,
there are no federal hourly restrictions on teen-agers of 16 and 17,
and many work far more than 20 hours.
   The National Assessment of Educational Progress, which surveys
tens of thousands of students on academic proficiency and recently
added questions on work, estimates that more than half of all 11th
graders and two-thirds of high school seniors have jobs.
   Teachers all have their stories about students whose work lives
have eclipsed their school lives, who leave the classroom to work
seven hours at a fast-food restaurant and show up the next day
unprepared, their heads nodding onto their desks.
   ``They will tell you, `I just don't have time to do that
assignment. I have to work,' and they expect you to buy that,'' says
Patrick Welsh, an Alexandria, Va., English teacher who has written a
book about high school.
   ``I don't buy it,'' he adds. ``But what happens is a gradual and
subtle erosion of standards and the amount of work you're going to
hit kids with. It's happening all over the country.''
   A Wisconsin study of four high schools did indeed find teachers
were making less demands on students than they had made five years
before, at least partially in response to the students' work
schedules.
   Work also has been associated with increased drug and alcohol
use. Working kids have more money, are under more stress and may
come into contact with older teen-agers more likely to have such
habits, says Laurence Steinberg, a Temple University researcher and
psychology professor.
   ``If your only outcome measure is test scores or grades, you may
be missing something,'' says Steinberg, co-author with Ellen
Greenberger of a book called ``When Teenagers Work.''
   The book describes a 1982 study of 531 Orange County, Calif.,
teen-agers in which the authors found that work in excess of 15 to
20 hours a week tended to cause lower grades and diminished
involvement in school.
   ``Earning and Learning,'' a recent report by the National
Assessment of Educational Progress, said a review of other studies
turned up no comparable results and added that ``there is no cause
for alarm concerning the academic performance of students who work.''
   But Steinberg said his and Greenberger's earlier results have
been confirmed in a much larger study of 10,000 students in
Wisconsin and California that has not yet been published.
   Paul Barton, author of the NAEP report, said he did not mean to
suggest that ``this is a rosy situation for all students. The
averages show no association between school and work, but individual
circumstances should be taken into account. There are probably lots
of kids buried in these averages who work long hours and do poorly,
and I'm sure educators see them.''
   The United States has by far the highest rate of working students
in the world, with Canada a distant second, Steinberg says.
``Working while one goes to high school is unheard of in Japan,'' he
says. ``The Japanese society is organized such that school is the
only thing that kids are to be concerned about while they're
teen-agers.''
   In America, parents often approve of and even push their children
to work. Many like knowing where their kids are and believe strongly
that a job, even if it is only flipping hamburgers at a fast-food
joint, builds character and teaches good work habits.
   ``Parents have this thing about the work ethic. You teach your
children to work very hard in jobs like waiting tables or pumping
gas, and this is a sign of responsibility. But a lot of those kids
get very poor grades and a lot of that money goes for beer on
weekends,'' says Susan Dawes of Alexandria, Va.
   Susan and David Dawes have raised two valedictorians who went on
to Ivy League colleges. A third child with a straight-A average is
headed for Princeton this fall. The three, all boys, were never
allowed to hold outside jobs.
   ``They were spending three to four hours a night on homework,''
Mrs. Dawes says. ``My husband never wanted them to work during the
school year. He had taken odd jobs during the school year and he
just thought it was too much.''
   Mrs. Dawes says she saw many kids with ``a lot of money from
their jobs and the parents didn't quite have the control of what the
kids spent their money on. I think a lot of it went to alcohol in
some cases. ... A lot of times what they want the money for is
nothing substantial, a better polo shirt. It's not worth their
working.''

   Statistics back up Mrs. Dawes' impression that most teen-agers
are working for discretionary income, not money needed to support
their families.
   Teenage Research Unlimited, a Chicago-area research firm, found
that teens had $31 billion in income derived from jobs, allowances
and other money from their parents in 1988. The average teen-ager
earns $61.50 a week, the company reported, and it is almost
exclusively discretionary.
   ``Teens now buy products and services ... such as hi-tech
televisions, and VCRs, personal computers and automobiles,'' TRU
said. Other high-priority items are cosmetics, clothes, and sports
and recreation equipment.
   That kind of consumerism irks teachers who understand that while
work is an economic necessity for some students, more seem to be
earning money for designer clothes, car payments and entertainment.
   ``They place more value on the instant gratification than on the
long-term value of getting a good education,'' says Mary Futrell, a
former high school business teacher who is winding up a six-year
tenure as president of the National Education Association.
   ``You don't want to destroy the work ethic. But at the same time
you know full well that this is interfering with their education,''
she adds. ``We need a better balance. We need to make sure young
people and their families understand that the primary focus has to
be on education. And if the job interferes with the education, they
should quit the job.''
   Teachers and others may bemoan their students' preoccupation with
work, but the service sector's voracious need for employees assures
that any student who wants a job will find one. Competition is so
tough for older teens that employers are dipping deeper into the 14-
and 15-year-old age group.
   In many cases, schools and parents are required to sign off on
student work permits, giving them an opportunity to intervene if
they think the job will be too much for the student to handle along
with school. ``As it stands now, most schools don't take advantage
of that opportunity,'' Steinberg said.
   He said that is because schools are susceptible to the demands of
local industry and the need for good community relations. In
California, Steinberg said, principals ``told us employers would
call them and say, `We need more students. Can you let more of them
out of school early?'''
   The press of unfilled jobs led the Reagan administration to
propose easing hourly restrictions on 14- and 15-year-olds, who may
now work only three hours on school days and no more than 18 hours a
week when school is in session.
   A Labor Department advisory committee concluded last fall that
``the prime responsibility for this age group should be toward their
educational and developmental needs'' and said permissible work
hours should not be expanded. The department is expected to heed the
panel's recommendation.
   At the other end of the spectrum, New York legislators are
pondering proposals to cut back work hours for 16- and 17-year-olds,
who are under no federal constraints. Under Gov. Mario Cuomo's plan,
they would be limited to four hours of work on school days and 28
hours a week while school is in session.
   In proposing the change last May, Cuomo acknowledged that work
experience can be valuable and that teen-agers are an important
labor pool for state businesses. But he added that ``it would be
very shortsighted for New York to have any child labor policies that
limit our young people's educational achievement.''

   Communist North Korea is gradually ending decades
of secrecy and claims to have achieved paradise, but it is a
paradise where all 20 million angels march in lockstep. Here is a
report from the AP bureau chief in Beijing, who visited Pyongyang
recently.

   The hermit of Asia is emerging and
what is seen is a regimented society that, in contrast to more
liberal communism elsewhere, trains its 20 million people to obey
every command of the state.
   North Korea claims to have achieved Paradise on Earth. Its
leaders declare with pride that the nation has no taxes, no prisons,
no want, no social unrest.
   Well-informed outsiders, however, say the country has trouble
feeding itself, is burdened with foreign debts and is rapidly
falling behind the vibrant capitalist economy of rival South Korea.
   Western journalists got a rare glimpse of a closed society during
the World Festival of Youth and Students, held July 1-8 in Pyongyang.
   The meeting of 15,000 young people, most of them from
left-leaning organizations, was the first major international event
in the North Korean capital and the city was carefully prepared as a
showcase.
   Pyongyang had a well-scrubbed look of prosperity. Tree-lined
avenues were festooned with banners and flags, and balconies of
well-kept apartment buildings were draped with flowers.
   Stores in the capital, which foreign residents said usually were
poorly stocked, bulged with goods and shoppers.
   Visitors were given tours of kindergartens with chandeliers and
indoor swimming pools, of hospitals outfitted with new Japanese and
West German equipment, of homes with color televisions and
refrigerators.
   They found another, jarring, element everywhere: total control of
the populace and the pervasive personality cult of President Kim Il
Sung, the 77-year-old ``Great Leader,'' and ``Dear Leader'' Kim Jong
Il, his son and presumed successor.
   Above their hearts, North Koreans wear badges with the elder
Kim's portrait.
   Nearly every room of every office and home has a picture of the
senior Kim, and many have portraits of both Kims.
   Billboards and monuments recite and depict heroic deeds of the
man who has led the North since the Korean Peninsula was divided in
1945, after the defeat of Japan in World War II.
   ``This is our happy land and it's all due to the Great Leader and
the Dear Leader,'' said Kim Ho Sok, manager of a collective farm
outside Pyongyang. ``Some people call this Paradise on Earth.''
   Visitors heard the same statement again and again from other
North Koreans.
   In Pyongyang, the national showcase, visitors see neat apartments
of three or four rooms with central heating, hot water and basic
appliances. The average factory worker is paid only about 100 won a
month, $45 at the official rate, but enjoys free housing, education
and medical care.
   Life is harder in the countryside. Many cottages do not have
running water or private toilets, but in areas around the capital,
stucco apartment buildings of two or three stories are being built
to replace them.
   Several foreigners with extensive knowledge of North Korea said
it has enormous problems.
   Many basic foods are rationed and, the foreigners said, the
government often cannot supply the average monthly meat allotment of
4.4 pounds per family. They said no fruit and few vegetables are
available in winter.
   Kim Byong Hun, an economist at Kim Il Sung University, denied
food was in short supply. He said the reason for rationing rice was
to build up reserves to feed South Korea after reunification.
   A foreigner who has made 18 visits to North Korea said the
government forces people to donate from their savings for the
purpose, it says, of helping poor people in South Korea.
   Some of the rules are difficult to fathom. Bicycles are banned in
Pyongyang even though cars are seldom seen on the broad boulevards.
The few traffic lights at intersections were turned off.
   North Koreans said vehicles are scarce because the nation lacks
petroleum deposits. This country's creed has become ``juche,'' a
philosophy of self-reliance.
   Everyone does ``voluntary'' work for the government once a week.
   Tens of thousands were mobilized to help build stadiums and
apartments when the North tried, in vain, to become co-host with the
South of the 1988 Summer Olympics. The facilities were used for the
youth festival.
   Where a person lives and works is not his business, but the
state's. Although many homes have televisions, few have radios,
apparently to prevent people from listening to foreign broadcasts.
   Several rural homes visited had wall loudspeakers used by local
officials to broadcast instructions and ideological teachings. North
Korea has almost no private telephones.
   Li Chol Sin, vice chairman of the Committee for Cultural
Relations with Foreign Countries, denied claims by Amnesty
International and other human rights groups that North Korea is a
major abuser of human rights.
   In North Korea, ``everyone has housing and free medical care and
there's no unemployment,'' he said. ``How can countries with
unemployment criticize us for human rights?''
   The regimen appears to accomplish its aim. Several students
stopped randomly at Kim Il Sung University said they never would
question government policy.
   ``In our country, students absolutely support the party,'' said
Pak Song Ok, a 21-year-old studying the philosophy of ``juche.''
   Economists said North Korea will not follow other communist
nations in experimenting with capitalist-style reform even though
the growth rate is only 2 percent to 3 percent a year, compared to
about 11 percent in South Korea.
   ``We will not liberalize our economy and not put much stress on
material incentives,'' said Kim Hwa Chon of Kim Il Sung University.
   He said workers receive some extra pay for exceeding quotas and
farmers may grow vegetables in private plots around their homes, but
the main rewards for hard work remain political: citations as model
workers or appointments as deputies in local legislatures.
   The economist illustrated allegiance to the self-reliance creed
by opening his shirt to show that even his T-shirt was a domestic
product.
   Foreign debt has accumulated _ despite ``juche'' _ to somewhere
between $5 billion and $8 billion, according to foreign observers.
   Dealing with North Korea is a gamble, one foreign businessman
said, because the government sometimes pays bills promptly and
sometimes neglects them. Another said his company accepts only
barter deals or cash in advance.
   Other foreigners said North Korea finances imported technology
for factories and limousines for high officials by selling gold and
other precious metals.
   In its hesitant opening to the oustside world, the government has
enacted a joint venture law and begun several projects, mainly with
communist countries or overseas Koreans.
   A 105-story, pyramid-shaped hotel now dominates the Pyongyang
skyline. It is to be finished in 1990 for what North Korea hopes
will be a flood of tourists with wads of foreign currency.

   He is the ``Great Leader'' whose
deeds are praised, whose portrait and words are everywhere. Kim Il
Sung has nearly deified himself in his self-made world of
regimentation and mass obedience.
   President Kim, who is 77 and has ruled North Korea since the
peninsula was divided in 1945, has crafted an unmatched cult of
personality.
   Four-year-olds at Changgwang Kindergarten in Pyongyang sit around
a detailed model of his birthplace, singing and chanting of his
exploits. Children in another room carol, ``We wish good health and
long life to Comrade Marshal Kim Il Sung.''
   At a nearby middle school, a 15-year-old recites to her English
class: ``Thanks to the Great Leader and the Dear Leader, we have no
worries about food or housing and we all lead happy lives.''
   The Dear Leader is the president's son and heir apparent, Kim
Jong Il.
   A chair and desk in the library of Kim Il Sung University are a
shrine, covered with a white cloth. Kim sat there during a visit to
the university in 1970.
   Stuffed animals he donated fill a display room at the university,
which also contains a shotgun the Great Leader provided so students
could add to the collection.
   At the main entrance of every school, institution, store, office
and factory is a larger-than-life portrait of Kim Il Sung in
appropriate context.
   Hospitals show him counseling doctors; schools portray him
receiving the adulation of children; in bookstores, his image bends
over weighty tomes.
   Visitors to a factory or school are told how Kim stood on a
nearby hill to order it built, then provided ``on-the-spot
guidance'' now and then.
   Li Hung Son of Pyongyang's largest textile mill said Kim had
visited it 48 times. ``Only under the wise guidance of Great Leader
Kim Il Sung have we achieved prosperity,'' he declared
   Kim Ho Sok of the Haksan collective farm outside Pyongyang said
Kim had visited 18 times to teach farmers which crops to grow and
how to manage the enterprise. ``Parents only give children life, but
the Great Leader takes care of all the people,'' he said.
   A huge stone monument that dominates the farm entrance is
emblazoned with the words he uttered during his visits.
   Nearly every room of every home has a portrait of the Great
Leader, often accompanied by one of the Dear Leader. Adults wear
badges with Kim Il Sung's picture just above the heart.
   From billboards and statues, Kim observes the streets and subway
stations of Pyongyang. An Arch of Triumph replica 200 feet high
honors his achievements as a young revolutionary.
   More than 40,000 people a day visit the shrine of Mangyongdae,
the thatch-roofed farmhouse on Pyongyang's outskirts where Kim was
born in 1912. Equal numbers go to the Korean Revolution Museum,
which has 100 rooms and 140,000 items relating to his revolutionary
accomplishments.
   Accounts in the museum say Kim's great-grandfather helped sink a
``U.S. pirate ship'' that was scouting possible invasion routes in
1866. They say his father was a leader in fighting the Japanese, who
ruled Korea from 1910 to 1945, and died young after imprisonment and
torture.
   The Great Leader himself, it is said, left home at 13 to join the
resistance and founded Korea's first Communist organization a year
later.
   Works by and about Kim fill Pyongyang's bookstores.
   One volume is titled ``A Great Man.'' It begins by saying history
has recorded the stories of many great men, but ``none can match
those of General Kim Il Sung, genius of mankind produced by Korea in
the 20th century.''
   His appearance in public can ignite a near-frenzy of celebration.
At opening ceremonies of an international youth festival in
Pyongyang, Kim's arrival on his dais was the signal for fireworks to
explode, doves to be released, trumpets to sound and thousands of
Koreans to genuflect worshipfully.
   An economist, Kim Hwa Chon, was asked about the high cost of
building memorials to the Great Leader and replied: ``We never count
the money for monuments. The hearts of the Korean people built
them.''

   Expert precision singing or dancing
by tens of thousands is no trick for North Koreans because
regimentation, to them, is the story of life.
   An international youth festival opened with ceremonies involving
70,000 youngsters from the host country, including a dazzling
display of rapidly changing pictures by 50,000 card flashers.
   Most of the 20 million citizens were mobilized to make sure
communist North Korea's first major international event would be a
success.
   Nearly everyone in Pyongyang helped build Kwangbok Street, a
high-rise apartment complex for 25,000 families, which was finished
in two years and housed festival delegates.
   Office workers ``volunteer'' for public service work once a week.
   Kindergarten teachers initiate a lifelong course in patriotism,
absolute loyalty to the system and reverence for President Kim Il
Sung.
   Ideological training and service to the state dominate the
education system. Workers have political study sessions at least
once a week.
   Songs, books, television, movies and loudspeaker announcements
beamed into homes reinforce the message.
   For those not convinced an entire nation could be trained to
obey, the youth offered some examples:
   _Thousands of pedestrians along the airport road waved whenever a
carload of foreigners passed.
   _Several hundred folk dancers in a city square stopped dancing
and applauded when told through the loudspeaker of a passing bus
that it carried foreigners.
   _A foreigner entered a department store and one order from his
North Korean interpreter opened a path in the crowd so the visitor
could be served first.
   _Buses and military trucks took thousands of North Koreans to
each festival event to make sure all were well-attended.
   _When festival delegates rallied at a school against China's
suppression of pro-democracy students, about 1,000 North Koreans
suddenly appeared and began dancing in the schoolyard, leaving no
room for a demonstration.

<HEAD>Against All Odds, Adventurous Joseph Ritchie Bids for Eastern Airlines</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT typo in wizard; also on financial wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Don't tell Joseph Ritchie he can't buy Eastern
Airlines.
   The quixotic bidder for the strikebound carrier may not have
experience in the flying business but he's a math wizard who's
vaulted over other daunting obstacles to build a successful company
from scratch. Along the way, he was a bus driver on Chicago's
southwest side, a prison guard and a deputy sheriff.
   Ritchie, 42, is principal owner and president of Chicago Research
&amp; Trading Group, a leading options trading company, yet has never
studied business or economics.
   ``You make more by paying more,'' Ritchie said in an interview
during a trip to New York. ``The more you reward people, the more
you're going to get back and the more you're going to make in the
long run.''
   Ritchie boasted that CRT, with around 600 employees, pays many of
them twice the industry average.
   Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo, on the other hand, has been locked in
a cost-cutting battle with the airline's unions that precipitated
the four-month-old strike.
   As a manager, Ritchie said he prefers to ``turn people loose''
rather than control them.
   Ritchie, a conservative Republican, is the American partner in JV
Dialogue, a U.S.-Soviet joint venture that sells personal computers
in the Soviet Union. He attributes its success to ``the human side
of the equation.''
   The people who command Ritchie's attention now are the 31,000
pilots, Machinists and flight attendants who worked for Miami-based
Eastern before their walkout that started March 4. Since early May,
Ritchie, in alliance with Eastern's three unions, has been trying to
buy the troubled carrier despite several stinging setbacks.
   Ritchie has offered $50 million and the unions have kicked in
another $50 million as well as wage concessions totaling $210
million. In addition, the unions have pledged up to $175 million
from their wages if certain goals aren't met during the first six
months of operation under joint ownership.
   Like a modern-day Don Quixote, Ritchie seems to be tilting at
windmills. Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.,
has increasingly gained momentum for his plan to rebuild Eastern as
a smaller carrier and sell $1.8 billion in assets to pay debts.
   The federal bankruptcy court in New York, where Eastern sought
protection from creditors on March 9, has removed Ritchie's buyout
plan from consideration, and Lorenzo has dismissed it as a ``joke''.
   Why does he go on?
   ``I think the people at Eastern understand why,'' Ritchie
answered with a Buddha-like smile. ``They've really become like
brothers and sisters to me.''
   Besides, although the bankruptcy court proceedings have turned
against him, Ritchie says he believes there's still hope from
another quarter: Washington. Despite the impression he gives of
farmboy ``Aw, shucks'' naivete, Ritchie is plugged into the
Washington power grid. He makes frequent trips to the capital, where
he has attended meetings with White House aides and members of
Congress.
   He appears to have some reason, at least, to be hopeful. Newt
Gingrich, House Republican Whip, recently wrote to Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner asking him to get involved in Eastern's
bankruptcy case.
   Some congressmen from both parties are concerned that the
disappearance of Eastern as a major carrier could threaten airline
competition _ already delicate because of the industry's
consolidation since deregulation in 1978.
   That concern led the aviation subcommittee of the House Public
Works and Transportation Committee to hold a hearing on Eastern on
June 29, and it extends to some high-ranking members of the Bush
Administration, according to Washington insiders.
   If the Transportation Department intervened in the case, it could
bring at least a temporary halt to the sales of Eastern assets that
the bankruptcy court has been approving, Ritchie said.
   When he talks about Eastern, Ritchie's dark eyes flash, framed by
his silver-white hair and trim mustache. Fresh off the Trump Shuttle
from Washington, he rotated his thin, wiry frame in stretching
exercises before sitting.
   Ritchie lives on a farm 55 miles west of Chicago with wife Sharon
and their nine children, whose ages range from 1 to 23. Until now,
he has mostly evaded the press, leaving phone calls unreturned and
sprinting out of bankruptcy court hearings to a waiting limousine.
His testimony at the congressional hearing on Eastern was a rare
public appearance; he has never given a press conference.
   ``My first impression was, `This man's not for real,''' said a
Ritchie associate, who asked not to be identified. ``I found him
refreshingly naive.''
   Ritchie says he first got the notion of engrossing himself in the
Eastern saga when he read an article in Time Magazine about the
strike back in March.
   Some sources in the options market say Ritchie's company, CRT,
has a reputation for honesty and efficiency. ``They're known as
being very moral,'' said a stock options trader who requested
anonymity. ``They want their employees to become rich, too,'' he
added, noting CRT's liberal profit-sharing policy.
   Candidates for jobs at CRT have to pass through an elaborate
interviewing process involving encounters with as many as 15 people.
   After graduating Wheaton College in suburban Chicago with a
bachelors degree in philosophy _ ``I hated school,'' he says _
Ritchie took the bus driving job in Chicago. That was followed by a
1-year stint as a guard at the Cook County House of Corrections,
where he played chess with the inmates.
   He became deputy sheriff in 1973 in Du Page County, Ill., where
sheriff Richard Doria remembers him now as ``very quiet, obviously
an intelligent kid.''
   Ritchie then moved to Los Angeles and started trading precious
metals, returning to Chicago in 1975 and starting CRT with a couple
of partners in 1977.
   He is considered a math whiz who cracked the problem of Rubik's
Cube in less than five minutes, and developed a basic mathematical
formula for options trading that helped CRT mushroom into a leader
in the field.

<HEAD>Reagan's Judicial Legacy</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan's imprint on the judiciary is far
broader and deeper than his three Supreme Court appointments _ in
eight years he named nearly half the judges now on the federal bench.
   His conservative legacy will extend well into the next century,
ever more significant as the Supreme Court loosens the reins its
decisions have imposed on lower courts. That's been the trend in
such recent rulings as those weighing against abortion, curtailing
affirmative action programs and permitting capital punishment of
youthful and retarded murderers.
   In a study of Reagan's judicial appointments, Sheldon Goldman, a
political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, says they
represent ``a major and what is likely to be an enduring legacy.''
   Reagan named 346, or 47 percent, of the nation's active federal
judges.
   Goldman, writing in the journal of the American Judicature
Society, says the Reagan administration set up the most systematic
philosophical screening process in U.S. history to check out
candidates for judicial appointments.
   ``It demonstrated the importance given judicial selection by the
Reagan administration, and the recognition that the appointment
process, by placing on the bench those opposed to the creation of
new rights by liberal activist courts, could be used to achieve the
administration's social agenda,'' Goldman says.
   That process was slow, gradually gaining headway during the
latter years of Reagan's presidency, and accelerating this year,
after President Bush had succeeded him.
   Goldman notes that because the lower courts must follow Supreme
Court precedent in their decisions, Reagan appointees could not
change course on issues such as abortion and affirmative action
until the high court modified its stand on them. Now that is
happening.
   Reagan named three new justices, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, and promoted William H. Rehnquist from
associate to chief justice.
   While that consolidated a conservative majority, the Reagan
appointees succeeded justices who were themselves centrist or
relatively conservative. It may fall to Bush to appoint successors
to the three oldest and most liberal justices, all of them over 80.
   ``I want people who will interpret the Constitution and not
legislate from the bench,'' Bush said as a candidate. That was
vintage Reagan, as was his warning against liberal activists on the
bench.
   But as Goldman observed, the high court ``has exercised its own
brand of judicial activism'' in rulings to undo earlier decisions on
civil rights and other issues.
   Goldman says the real impact of Reagan's appointments on district
and appeals court decisions will be gradual, reaching into the 21st
century, and likely to be reinforced by the judges Bush chooses.
   Whether that's good or bad depends on the viewpoint of the person
who is judging the trend.
   ``For civil libertarians this means that when the country
celebrates the bicentennial of the ratification of the Bill of
Rights in 1991, the courts will be dominated by those hostile to a
liberal reading of those rights,'' Goldman says. ``For judicial
conservatives, this means a healthy return to government by the
elected representatives of the people.''
   In the conservative view, such contentious issues as abortion,
civil rights and capital punishment belong in the hands of
politicians, voters and legislators, rather than in the hands of
judges with lifetime tenure.
   That's the line Justice Scalia followed in his separate opinion
on the abortion decision. He said the court should have overturned
its original abortion rights decision and thus yielded its control
``of what I believe to be, and many of our citizens recognize to be,
a political issue.''
   Scalia is unwavering in that view. A decade ago, as a University
of Chicago law professor, he advanced the same argument on federal
rule-making.
   ``The main problem is that the agencies have been assigned too
many tasks requiring judgments that are of an essentially political
nature and that ought to be made by our elected representatives,''
he said then.
   Not that elected representatives necessarily want to handle
contentious, closely divided issues on which a vote gained may well
mean a vote lost, too. By conservative reasoning, that's their
problem.

<HEAD>Population Growth Still Outpaces Food Output in Sahel, Analyst Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's an area in West Africa two-thirds the size
of the United States, not counting Alaska. It's the Sahel, a region
the ``Green Revolution'' forgot and is not likely to remember.
   The land is poor, the people are poor, and there are too many of
them. The outlook is grim, says Agriculture Department economist
John Day.
   ``If the Sahel's population of 38 million keeps growing at its
annual rate of 2.8 percent, it will double in about 25 years,'' he
said. ``The land's carrying capacity _ its ability to provide food
and fiber for humans and animals without losing long-term
productivity _ has already been exceeded.''
   If current population trends continue, along with current farming
technologies, the population of the Sahel will exceed the land's
carrying capacity by about 30 million people by the turn of the
century, Day said.
   Collectively, he said, the eight countries that make up the Sahel
comprise the only region in the world where population growth has
outpaced increases in food production over the last 20 years.
   The countries are Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina
Faso, Niger, Chad and Cape Verde.
   Only 4 percent of the region is arable, or fit for crops. The
balance is desert, 59 percent; permanent pasture, 26 percent; and
woodlands, 11 percent.
   Per capita food production declined about 1.6 percent annually
from 1962 to 1988 and is highly variable from year to year, Day
writes in the July issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   Gains in overall food output have come primarily from expanding
crop plantings into marginal lands and by cropping traditional farm
plots more intensively, he said. But the average yields of food
crops have dropped the past 20 years.
   As soil degradation develops, land is turned into desert. It is
this ``desertification'' process that has caused concerns in some
other parts of the world, not only in the Sahel.
   Day outlined some of the steps that he thinks could be taken if
the Sahel is to slow its downward spin and relieve some of the
region's dependence on imports and food aid.
   ``Even during 1986 and 1987, when weather was better and domestic
production was up, imports and food aid made up about 20 percent of
the region's food supply,'' he said.
   Economic policies have stunted farmers' incentives to adopt new
technology and have strongly affected production methods, Day said.
   For example, he said, Sahelian currencies are over-valued, which
makes imports relatively cheap and exports expensive. And that
encourages food imports and depresses farm prices. Urban wages are
artificially high, and cheap food policies hamper production.
   Large-scale irrigation systems hold little promise in the Sahel,
at least for the present, Day said. Eighty-five percent of the
region gets less than 24 inches of rainfall annually.
   The Green Revolution technology dramatically boosted crop
production in Asia, Latin America and other parts of Africa, but not
in the Sahel.
   Day said the Green Revolution's output growth was based largely
on gains from high-yielding crop varieties, which are mostly
effective when combined with ample water and chemical fertilizers.
   But water control, or irrigation, is largely absent in the Sahel.
Sahelian farmers have generally rejected the Green Revolution
approach because the high-yielding varieties rarely outperform
traditional crops there.
   ``Farmers have learned that applying fertilizers in semiarid
regions lacking water control is very risky, with a high probability
of economic loss,'' he said.
   Day said one of the questions is whether traditional production
techniques can be modified to boost productivity and meet the
Sahel's needs. Development specialists, he said, ``are not convinced
that a low-resource approach by itself can achieve these
objectives.''
   Basically, that would involve animal and human labor in cropping
systems that use manures and few purchased production ``inputs''
such as machines or fertilizer and other chemicals.
   Dryland farming techniques already used in India, Australia, the
United States and other countries could be adapted to the Sahel.
   ``Research shows that using moisture-conserving furrow-dikes and
chemical fertilizers, for example, could raise the Sahel's food
production and farm income 50 percent to 70 percent, and reduce soil
erosion by as much as 70 percent,'' Day said.
   ``Farming will always be risky in the Sahel,'' he said. ``But
more efforts to conserve soil and water could cut the risks.''
   Day said ``efforts to encourage voluntary population control are
important'' and could ``help bring the population into closer
balance with the land's carrying capacity.''
   Lester R. Brown, head of Worldwatch Institute, a private,
Washington-based research organization, has warned for many years of
desertification, the abuse of farmland and forests, and the need for
curbing population growth.
   ``Unfortunately, farmers alone cannot brighten the world's food
prospects,'' Brown said in his 1989 report, ``State of the World.''
``Without the help of national leaders and family planners in
slowing population growth, the hunger and malnutrition that has
already engulfed large parts of Africa and Latin America will deepen
and spread.''
   Brown added: ``Population stabilization is the only acceptable
goal in a world where growth in human numbers is leading to a
life-threatening deterioration of environmental systems.''

   The choir is black at St. Catherine of Sienna
Roman Catholic Church, as are the eucharistic ministers and lectors,
the altar boys and girls, even the hymnal.
   The priest, however, is white. But Father Ernie Rudloff has
attended workshops on black preaching, and has learned to walk among
the congregation while giving his sermon, to speak longer and
louder, to make a few jokes and invite an occasional ``Amen!'' from
his almost all-black congregation.
   ``Father Ernie is a black white priest,'' insists John Mitchell,
a member of the Queens parish for three decades. ``He's adapting the
old ways to please us.''
   Rudloff and flock epitomize a dilemma facing the U.S. Catholic
Church: an expanding black laity and a dearth of black clergy.
   The case of the Rev. George A. Stallings, a Washington priest who
was suspended after he formed his own church, has focused attention
on racial tensions in the church and blacks' desire for new forms of
worship.
   But what some call the ``black Mass'' is a fait accompli in urban
dioceses, and most black Catholics say they're most concerned with
the need for more black priests and lay leaders.
   Rudloff _ a popular priest who makes no apologies for his race _
sums up part of the problem this way: ``The black priests just
aren't there.''
   In the past five years the American church's black membership has
doubled to 2 million, but there still are only 300 black priests _
roughly the same as 15 years ago _ and 600 black nuns and other
religious. Less than 100 of the nation's 1,000 predominantly black
parishes have a black pastor.
   The diocese of Brooklyn has around 150,000 black Catholics, more
than any other American diocese, and more than a half dozen
all-black parishes. But there are only two black pastors and only a
few more black parish priests. At St. Catherine's there still are no
black deacons, although two are in training, and both the school and
the religious education program are headed by white nuns.
   Black Catholics say that the paucity of black clergy and lay
leaders is a reflection of the church's historic racism _ a racism
to which several parishioners at St. Catherine's can testify.
   Charlie Bowen, a deaconate candidate, recalls life at a Catholic
military boarding school in Virginia where blacks and whites sat on
separate sides of the chapel. John Mitchell says that as a boy he
was thrown out of a church in Harlem by a white priest who thought
he was going to steal something. And when he first came to St.
Catherine's in 1956, he says, a white couple would not rise to let
him and his family get seats further down a pew.
   Such experiences led them to sympathize with Stallings _ up to a
point.
   ``If it's possible to be right and wrong, then Father Stallings
is right and wrong,'' says Bowen, who helps distribute holy
communion at morning Mass. ``There are problems in the church. But
if you have a problem in your family, you don't go out and start
another family.''
   On Wednesday the nation's black Catholic bishops struck a similar
note, urging Stallings to return to the church and fight racism from
within it.
   The bishops said they hoped Stallings and his followers ``are not
commingling personal disappointment, individually felt frustrations
and personal anger under the banner of racism.'' Racism, they said,
``is too serious an issue to be used as a cover for selfish
concerns.''
   Blacks at St. Catherine's are proud of their contribution to the
church, especially singing and preaching. ``The traditional Mass was
so somber that by the time it was over you wanted to cry,'' says
Millicent Modeste. ``But you should have joy in your soul at church.
It should give you a lift for the rest of the day.''
   ``The Bible says, `Make a joyous noise,''' adds Mitchell. The
noisemakers have come to include Charlotte Rydzewski, who first came
to St. Catherine's 35 years ago, when most parishioners were white
like her. When the congregation takes up rocking Gospel hymns such
as ``God Never Fails,'' ``you can hear her all over the church,''
Mitchell said.
   The traditional Christian greeting of peace _ treated by many
white Catholics as a perfunctory obligation _ ``resembles a
mini-coffee break here,'' says Rudloff, who walks up and down the
aisle, shaking hands. ``We have to cut it off so we can get on with
Mass.''
   At Our Lady of Charity in Brooklyn, a black pastor has taken what
he calls ``inculturization'' even further. There are drums as well
as an organ, a statue of a black Jesus over the altar, and prayers
for the release of Nelson Mandela from a South African jail. The
Rev. Robert Seay wears a white African stole over his vestments.
   The church's biggest liability in developing more priests like
Seay is its own history, including the use of slaves on Jesuit farms
in the first half of the 19th century. The relatively progressive
archdiocese of Chicago did not ordain its first black priest until
1947, and separate churches for black Catholics were common in large
cities well into the 1950s.
   But in the 1960s the number of black Catholics increased 35
percent _ more than half the new members were converts _ and today
immigration and the popularity of urban parochial schools continue
to extend Catholicism among blacks. Although the priest population
has remained stagnant, there are 13 black bishops, including
Archbishop Eugene Marino of Atlanta, compared to one in 1968.
   In 1987 the National Conference of Catholic Bishops created a
Secretariat for Black Catholics, and more than 50 similar offices
have been set up in dioceses around the country.
   Beverly Carroll is director of the secretariat. Black people have
long memories, she says, and the church ``has a long history to
overcome. We had to struggle just to sit in church, let alone
minister.''
   ``We suffer the sins of our fathers,'' says Seay. ``The church in
earlier days refused to have an open door policy. Now we're paying
for that.''

<HEAD>Natural Gas: Best Gasoline Substitute, Scientists Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wire.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Auto pollution, oil spills and growing dependence on foreigners
for fuel have helped natural gas emerge as an energy solution that's
literally lurking beneath our feet, scientists say.
   The naturally occurring gas called methane, once considered
useful mainly to heat and cook, is now widely viewed as the most
realistic way to power cars and trucks into the 21st century because
it is plentiful, safe and clean.
   There's such a vast supply underground that U.S. energy companies
cap wells when the price gets too low for profitable sale.
Petroleum-rich Saudi Arabia squanders methane by burning the gas as
it spurts from crude oil wells.
   ``The Saudis flare each day enough gas to fuel two-thirds of the
road transport of Western Europe,'' says Princeton University
professor Enoch Durbin, a leading proponent of the natural gas
alternative.
   ``From a satellite, the brightest subject on earth you'd think
would be New York or San Francisco. It's the Saudi fields.''
   Natural-gas powered vehicles in Canada, part of an experimental
fuel-alternative program Durbin helped create, have logged 500,000
miles without an overhaul because gaseous fuel does not cause the
wear and tear of liquid fuel. Liquid fuels wash lubricants off walls
of a car's engine, increasing friction and wear.
   The Canadian vehicles recently began rusting and falling apart.
But the engines are in such good condition they are being sold for
use in other vehicles, Durbin says.
   Despite its attractiveness, natural gas as a motor fuel has two
big drawbacks.
   First, it takes up 1,000 times the space of equivalent gasoline
and must therefore be compressed. Even then, it occupies more space
than gasoline, so natural-gas powered vehicles need big tanks and
frequent fillups.
   A car Durbin converted and supplied with two natural gas tanks
could go only 200 miles without a refill, for example.
   The second obstacle is the lack of a nationwide refueling
structure.
   ``If you're going to use it you have to be confined to a regular
route where you can refill,'' says Michael German, senior vice
president of the American Gas Association, which represents U.S.
distributors and pipelines.
   German says the 30,000 cars in the United States now running on
natural gas are mainly fleet vehicles that travel regular routes.
   One remedy proposed is to equip vehicles with dual-fuel tanks, so
if the natural gas runs out, the driver could switch to gasoline.
But the extra tanks would take up passenger and cargo space.
   Where to store natural gas also is considered by some to be a
problem. Unlike petroleum, natural gas needs a large, leakproof
storage vault or it escapes into the atmosphere.
   Natural gas now flows to homes and businesses through about 1.2
million miles of underground metal pipe.
   So the system exists for getting gas from producers to service
stations. What's needed, scientists say, are pumps at the stations
to dispense the gas into vehicles.
   Ninety-three percent of the natural gas used in the United States
is domestically produced and the rest comes from Canada. Nearly half
the crude oil consumed here, on the other hand, is foreign.
   About 80 percent of natural gas comes from underground gas
reservoirs; the rest is found with oil.
   Some experts worry that greatly increased use of natural gas
would deplete supplies and increase reliance on foreign energy
suppliers, but others reject that fear.
   ``We have such huge methane reserves we don't know how much we
have,'' says Raymond Baddour, chemical engineering professor at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``I think this fuel has a
very bright future for you, your children and grandchildren.''
   Moreover, it is renewable from unconventional sources such as
putrifying garbage, sewage and animal waste, which theoretically
could yield limitless supplies.
   Durbin recalls asking a geologist about the supply of natural gas.
   ``He said, `What do you want to pay? At 60 cents per 1,000 cubic
feet, there's none.'
   ``No one wants to drill a deep hole if it's cheap,'' Durbin says.
``If you tell me you're willing to pay $2 instead of 60 cents, I
suddenly can drill a deep hole.''
   The Department of Energy estimates proven reserves of natural gas
in the United States total 187.2 trillion cubic feet. By some
reckonngs, that represents at least three centuries' worth of
supply, even if all U.S. vehicles burned natural gas instead of
gasoline.
   Proven reserves of domestic crude oil, in comparison, are
estimated at 27.3 billion barrels, or a 9{-year supply at current
consumption rates.
   ``There is a tremendous amount of shut-in gas that is sitting
there waiting for a market or for the price to go up, which is the
same thing,'' says Charles Andrew, an official of John S. Herold &amp;
Co., an oil and gas appraisal concern.
   About a half million cars are powered by natural gas worldwide,
all backyard creations. No auto manufacturer makes a natural gas
car, but that is changing.
   The Soviet Union, for example, is developing a plant to mass
produce natural gas-powered vehicles by 1991.
   In the United States, the allure of natural gas has presented
automakers with a Catch-22 problem. They are reluctant to build a
natural-gas car, largely because the fuel is not yet widely
available. Oil companies balk at producing large quantities until
the vehicles gain acceptance.
   New clean air regulations, however, could spur them into action.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has set air quality standards
for new buses in 1991 that no diesel engine can now meet. Similar
rules for trucks take effect in 1994.
   While diesel engine manufacturers are designing prototypes that
would burn substitute fuels, natural gas is at the top of the list.
   ``They've kept their options open but natural gas has very
clean-burning fuel with no particulate matter, which is the biggest
problem diesel users have,'' German says. ``So it makes sense to
focus on natural gas over the others.''
   Several U.S. cities are now experimenting with natural gas to
power municipal vehicles, largely because fleet operators realize
they could save money, German says.
   A gallon equivalent of natural gas costs about 40 cents vs. about
$1.15 for regular unleaded. A taxi company in Canada that spent
$900,000 to convert 128 vehicles, for example, recovered the expense
in a year via savings of $75,000 a month in fuel costs.
   Another big advantage of natural gas is that it emits mainly
water and carbon dioxide when burned.
   ``You use natural gas at home without ventilating. You're cooking
with it. You wouldn't think of using kerosene, gasoline or anything
else without ventilation,'' says Durbin.
   Moreover, Durbin and others say, natural gas doesn't ignite as
easily as gasoline, so in a car crash it would dissipate harmlessly
instead of exploding in a dangerous fireball.
   Other gasoline alternatives proposed by the Bush Administration,
including ethanol and methanol, are costlier, dirtier and would
increase oil consumption because it takes more crude to make them,
says MIT professor David White, co-director of the school's energy
laboratory.
   ``Some people who are proposing these changes haven't done their
homework,'' White says.

   The members of the Sandinista
directorate have not changed since the overthrow of dictator
Anastasio Somoza a decade ago.
   Their unity has surprised foreign diplomats, who had expected a
split among the nine Commanders of the Revolution. No such problem
has arisen, although some former guerrilla leaders and sympathizers
have gone over to the anti-Sandinista resistance.
   Members of the Sandinista National Liberation Front directorate
control the executive, legislature, police, army and other key
posts. Some well-known officials, such as Vice President Sergio
Ramirez and Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto, are not among the nine.
   These are the directorate's members:
   _Daniel Ortega, 43, president and likely Sandinista presidential
candidate in general elections scheduled for Feb. 25. His leadership
style _ hard work, and a decision-making process that is open to
many opinions _ has done much to hold the directorate together.
   _Humberto Ortega, 47, defense minister. Opponents refer to ``the
government of the Ortega brothers,'' reflecting the widespread
attitude that together _ as in Cuba with Fidel and Raul Castro in
the same posts _ they represent the real power in Nicaragua.
   _Bayardo Arce, 39. As vice-coordinator of the Sandinista
executive commission, Arce is Ortega's deputy for ideology. He is
described as an ideological hard-liner and the main link between the
Sandinistas and Salvadoran guerrillas.
   _Tomas Borge, 58, the directorate's senior member, who helped
found the Sandinistas in July 1961 and is known as a hard-liner. As
interior minister, he is in charge of police and state security.
   _Luis Carrion, 37, minister of economy, industry and commerce.
Carrion was born into one of Nicaragua's wealthiest families.
   _Carlos Nunez, 38, president of the National Assembly, the
unicameral legislature.
   _Henry Ruiz Hernandez, 49, minister of external cooperation since
1985 and planning minister before that.
   _Victor Tirado, 49, head of the Department of Mass Organizations.
Tirado, born in Mexico, joined the Sandinistas in 1963 and became a
Nicaraguan citizen in September 1979.
   _Jaime Wheelock, 42, agriculture minister and son of a wealthy
landowning family.

   A Japanese drug developed to fight cancerous
tumors is startlingly effective in halting rejection of transplanted
kidneys, say doctors in Japan who are the first to test the compound
on organ recipients.
   American researchers are just as impressed with
15-deoxyspergualin, also known as DSG, and expect to try it on
transplant patients in a year or two.
   ``It's clearly very effective. Yet I think it's teaching us that
there are ways to control the immune system we heretofore had not
even thought possible,'' said Dr. Randall Morris, director of the
laboratory for transplantation immunology at Stanford University.
   Among the possibilities suggested by DSG research but yet to be
proven outside the laboratory are lower doses of cyclosporine, a
potent anti-rejection drug fraught with side effects; routine
matching of organs regardless of blood type; and longer survival of
animals getting organs from other species, a step toward the day
when animal organs might be transplanted into humans.
   ``At the very least, if it allows us to lower the dose of
cyclosporine, it might be useful,'' said Dr. Robert Corry, chairman
of surgery at the University of Iowa and president of the United
Network for Organ Sharing.
   Transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas E. Starzl of the University of
Pittsburgh is encouraged by the Japanese findings even though he
halted animal tests several years ago because of the drug's toxicity
and its intravenous use.
   ``In the big picture, over a long period of time, you can't give
drugs intravenously so that's a limitation,'' but it could be useful
``as a kind of bail-out on a short-term basis to control
rejection,'' Starzl said.
   ``To get 100 percent of graft survival, we must have several
kinds of potent immune-suppressive drugs,'' said Dr. Hiroshi
Amemiya, head of surgical research at the National Cardiovascular
Center in Osaka, Japan. ``This is one of that kind of potent drugs.''
   There were 9,123 kidney transplants in the United States last
year, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. Virtually
all transplant recipients experience some organ rejection, but most
is temporary, minor and can be controlled with drugs. Ninety-six
percent of transplanted kidneys are functioning a year after surgery
if the organs come from living relatives, said Kelle Straw of UNOS.
The success rate is 91 percent when the kidneys come from dead
strangers _ as is the case in the vast majority of transplants.
   DSG is a chemical byproduct of spergualin, a substance isolated
by Japanese scientists in 1981 from bacteria found in soil. Two
Japanese companies launched laboratory tests in 1985, and Amemiya
and others began conducting the world's first clinical trials
involving transplant patients last fall.
   Bristol-Myers Co. is under agreement with the Japanese firms to
develop the synthetic drug for use in the United States.
   U.S. researchers have studied DSG as an anti-rejection agent in
animals, but it has been tested on about 90 cancer patients over the
past three years. The National Cancer Institute is conducting
clinical trials at the University of Texas at San Antonio and
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
   The human tests were begun after experiments showed DSG inhibited
growth of tumors in mice, said Dr. Michaele Christian, senior
investigator in the NCI's developmental chemotherapy section. ``It's
hard to say whether the drug is going to be useful as an anti-cancer
agent. It's too early to tell.''
   Amemiya reported at the American Society of Transplant Surgeons'
annual meeting in Chicago last month that 30 kidney recipients at
six centers in Japan were treated temporarily with DSG. The 18 males
and 12 females, ranging in age from 13 to 43, received their new
kidneys as far back as 1975.
   The compound was administered after they suffered organ
rejection. Standard anti-rejection drugs didn't work, including
OKT3, which wipes out white blood cells called T-cells that attack
transplanted organs, Amemiya said.
   The Food and Drug Administration approved OKT3 in 1987 for
general use in kidney transplantation. It still is experimental in
other types of transplants.
   Twenty-seven of the 34 episodes of organ rejection experienced by
the Japanese patients were reversed within 10 days, according to
Amemiya. Only one transplanted kidney was lost, with the patient
forced back to dialysis.
   DSG worked best with the milder forms of rejection occurring
within six months of transplantation, Amemiya said. ``We don't have
any good therapy for chronic rejection,'' which occurs one to five
years later and is characterized by a narrowing of the transplanted
organ's arteries.
   Side effects were temporary and included nausea and numbness
around the mouth. Each of the 30 Japanese patients continued to
receive cyclosporine and other immune-suppressive medications during
the trial, Amemiya said.
   Cyclosporine, derived from a soil fungus, helps prevent rejection
by freezing certain T-cells so they don't divide and increase in
number. But the daily oral doses can lead to kidney failure and high
blood pressure.
   DSG allows certain T-cells to divide normally but for some reason
the cells do not attack transplanted tissue, Morris said.
   Transplanted organs also can be attacked by antibodies the
recipient's body produces in response to foreign tissue.
Transplanting organs across blood types or from one species to
another generates even more of these antibodies.
   Cyclosporine and other anti-rejection drugs prevent the
antibodies from forming, provided the medication is given as soon as
an organ is transplanted. Treatment must continue throughout the
patient's life.
   While DSG cannot reduce antibodies already in the blood, there is
evidence it can suppress production of more _ possibly explaining
its ability to prolong survival of animals receiving organs from
other types of animals, Morris said.
   In experiments at Stanford, transplanted hearts in mice were
rejected within 11 days when no medication was given and within a
month if cyclosporine was given daily. When mice got DSG for several
weeks right after transplants, their new hearts functioned for
several months after treatment ceased.
   ``The paramount and striking attribute of DSG to me is its
ability to educate the immune system to accept the graft for a very
long period,'' Morris said. ``This means that patient may not have
to take this drug forever.''

<TEXT>
   A fungus that may have been released into
the environment 79 years ago has killed off many gypsy moth
caterpillars in three Northeast states and could lead to a weapon
against the devastating insects.
   Entomologists won't know until they do a gypsy moth egg count in
the fall if the fungus blocked or just delayed an outbreak, but it
has spared thousands of trees from defoliation in Connecticut,
Massachusetts and New York.
   Scientists also don't know whether the fungus flourished only
because of this year's unusually cool, wet spring and will subside.
   ``I think this is probably something we may never see again,''
said U.S. Forest Service entomologist Michael McManus.
   Nonetheless, federal and state entomologists are growing the
fungus to ascertain its species and ensure that samples are
preserved.
   The gypsy moth, a European import, escaped from a Massachusetts
researcher in 1882 as he tried to cross it with a silkworm to make
stronger silk. The moth has spread slowly, reaching Ohio and West
Virginia in great numbers and farther west in small pockets. It
feeds mostly on the leaves of oak and other hardwood trees, and in a
major infestation in 1980-81 caterpillars stripped more than 12
million acres in the East _ including over half Connecticut's 3
million acres.
   Generally, the caterpillars work in a cycle, with light
defoliation in the first year increasing in the second and third
years. Severe defoliation over several years will slow the growth of
a tree, and in some cases kill it.
   Nearly a quarter-million acres in Pennsylvania were sprayed this
year _ the first year of a cycle _ with insecticide. Other states
also sprayed, mostly in urban and suburban areas. Dimilin, a
pesticide that inhibits the growth and development of the
caterpillars, is most commonly used.
   Researchers are also working on products to limit the damage of
the moth while minimizing damage to the rest of the environment.
   Forest Service scientists have created a virus-based pesticide,
called ``Gypchek,'' that destroys many of the insects and
drastically affects their ability to reproduce. But it has not been
perfected and a reasonably priced and practical commercial product
is probably at least two years away.
   Scientists are also experimenting with a protozoa native to
Europe that weakens gypsy moths and leaves them more vulunerable to
diseases.
   From 1905 to 1911, researchers imported 127 species of the moth's
natural enemies from Europe and the Soviet Union, but only eight
have survived. In 1910 and 1911, researchers released a small amount
of a Japanese fungus in suburban Boston; it infected only a small
percentage of the caterpillars in the target aread, but the research
was conducted under unfavorable weather conditions.
   Entomologists at the Connecticut Agriculture Experiment Station
here excitedly announced in June that a fungus, and not a virus that
periodically attacks gypsy moths, had killed many leaf-eating larvae
in the three states, and a recent report indicates it may be at work
in New Jersey.
   The fungus spores land on the caterpillars and produce enzymes
that eat through the skin. Inside, the fungus grows, killing the
caterpillar.
   ``Quite possibly this is the same thing and this has been
spreading slowly and gone undetected or never had an opportunity to
express itself until this year,'' said entomologist Theodore
Andreadis at the Experiment Station.
   Scientists have conducted two very limited releases of the
Japanese fungus in recent years, at the Allegany State Park in New
York in 1985 and Shenandoah National Park in Virginia in 1986. In
both cases, there was only very limited transmission of the fungus
from infected caterpillars to native larvae, said Ann Hajek, a U.S.
Department of Agriculture entomologist in Ithaca.
   But neither was a good test. A virus attacked the gypsy moths in
the 1985 exeriment, and a drought hampered the research the
following year.
   The fungus release has tightly controlled; federal regulations
put it ``in the same bag as genetically engineered micororganisms,''
Hajek said.
   McManus questioned if the fungus could be successfully used as a
biological weapon because there would have to be enough moisture for
it to survive.
   Andreadis said that if the fungus at work in the Northeast is the
Japanese strain, regulators should allow its use as a biological
control.

   It may seem unromantic to stamp out the
twinkling of the stars, but astronomer Samuel Durrance doesn't think
so.
   ``In order to study them, about their mysteries, we have to be
able to see them better,'' Durrance said. ``We're trying to see
their true beauty.''
   Durrance leads a Johns Hopkins University team working on
adaptive optics technology, which uses mirrors, sensors and
computers to reduce the atmospheric distortion that makes stars seem
to dance. ``Much like lying at the bottom of a pool and looking at
an object being dangled above you the water distorts the image of
what you see quite severely. ... The twinkling is not an aspect of
the stars but an aspect of the atmosphere.''
   Scientists at other institutions are developing similar
instruments. By making it easier to examine material around stars,
they may bring astronomers closer to an elusive goal _ discovering
planets outside our solar system.
   Scientists theorize that material left after a star has formed
falls into a stable orbit around it and coalesces over millions of
years into planets.
   The Johns Hopkins instrument won't allow astronomers to directly
see possible planets, but could let them measure changes in the
brightness around a star, possible evidence of planets, said
researcher Mark Clampin.
   The instrument, an adaptive optics coronagraph, uses two mirrors,
sensors and a high-speed computer to manipulate light waves entering
a telescope. One mirror is a thin membrane whose contours can be
changed as often as 100 times a second to compensate for the motion
of a star's image. The other, called a flat mirror, wobbles 100
times a second to eliminate the distortion of light rays as they
strike the telescope lens.
   Only the flat mirror was tested during observations in May of
Beta Pictoris, a star 312 trillion miles away, at an observatory in
Las Campanas, Chile. The entire system is expected to be ready in
about two years.
   A complete system already is in use at the National Optical
Astronomy Observatories in Tucson, Ariz. Astronomer Larry Goad said
it is one of two started in anticipation of the next generation of
ground-based telescopes.
   The new telescopes, which will be about eight meters in diameter
instead of the customary two to five meters, will need help
correcting distortions in the larger amount of light they can gather.
   Goad said adaptive optics devices are considered experimental at
this point because nobody except their creators can figure out how
to operate them.
   Astronomers at the University of California at Berkeley also have
an experimental system in the works. And a related development at
the University of Illinois is the invention of laser-generated
artificial stars. An artificial star can provide the ``guide star''
scientists need to calibrate adaptive optics equipment properly,
said electrical engineer Chet Gardner.
   Artificial stars, formed with a yellow-orange laser beam that
illuminates a spot in a layer of sodium particles about 60 miles
high, can compensate for the usual lack of a bright object in the
sky near the object under study.
   `In order to do this de-twinkling, one needs a very bright object
or a reference point that is very bright ... so you can deform the
mirror to correct the distortion,'' Gardner said. ``This star works
just as well as an actual star that may be millions of miles away.''
   The Hopkins instrument was designed in part to get a better look
at an unusual disk around Beta Pictoris, which was detected several
years ago by its infrared emissions, Clampin said. It is too soon to
know what the observations in Chile will yield. Images of the Beta
Pictoris disk, containing matter that could be planets or material
that will form planets, are being enhanced.
   ``It's hard to predict revolutions,'' Durrance said. ``It's
certainly going to have an impact, and I think it will have a major
impact when we can eliminate the effects of the distortion.''

<HEAD>Researchers Advance Bone Research With Computer Image Scanner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computerized X-ray scanner developed to
find defects in auto parts is giving medical researchers better
glimpses of bone structure than conventional analysis methods can,
and in less time.
   ``This new technology is allowing us to better understand the
consequences of bone changes caused by disease or age,'' such as
osteoporosis, said Steven Goldstein, director of the University of
Michigan's orthopedic research lab.
   The microcomputer tomography scanner, or MicroCT, was developed
in 1981 by Ford Motor Co. to find structural flaws in ceramic car
parts. It yields three-dimensional images, which Goldstein is using
to study trabecular bone _ a porous, spongy, shock-absorbing
structure found near joints.
   Osteoporosis and other bone diseases affect trabecular bone
first, and more extremely, than other bone. Osteoporosis, a common
ailment among the elderly, occurs when bones become porous, brittle
and slower to heal.
   By studying how trabecular bone changes during the course of the
disease, Goldstein hopes to learn how to control the weakening.
   The MicroCT, in 15 minutes, takes 129 two-dimensional X-rays of a
small bone sample from several angles. The data is fed to a computer
that creates a three-dimensional image in less than three hours.
   The computerized bone reconstruction is faster than microscopic
analysis, yields more details and lets researchers examine inner
bone structure without having to slice up the specimen, he said.
   However, the MicroCT cannot be used on living patients, and is
only used on bone specimens because it would burn soft tissue.

<HEAD>Compact Disc Holds Huge Quantity of Computer Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new computerized compact disc with the
capacity of 1,350 floppy diskettes may mean affordable access to
data once reserved only for those with mainframe computers and
sizeable budgets, researchers say.
   FEDSTAT, the Compact Disc-Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) and the
technology that makes it work are a venture of the University of
Alabama, JVC Disc America Co. and U.S. Statistics Inc., a
Virginia-based online data service.
   FEDSTAT contains some of the most widely used Census Bureau
demographic and economic data. On the single disc are statistics
about each city and county in the United States _ information about
population, business and the economy.
   While some of the information has been available in printed form,
some had been accessible only through magnetic tape processed by a
mainframe computer.
   ``Never before has this much government data been available in an
inexpensive, easily used format,'' said Philip Turner, dean of the
graduate school of library service and director of the project for
the university.
   The county business patterns files alone take up about 2{ feet of
shelf space on paper, said U.S. Statistics President Warren Glimpse.
The capacity can't be measured only in terms of its volume as found
in other sources; ``this is a new approach to data,'' he said. ``The
capacity to cross-tabulate, to create new data, is infinite with
FEDSTAT.''
   The disc contains 484 million characters. Retailing at $195, it
is used on a CD-ROM player attached to a personal computer. The
player costs about $500.
   Data range from population figures as specific as the number of
children under 5 for any county in the nation to annual economic
data by county for the past 20 years. Users also can prepare county
maps selecting from thousands of subjects; compare counties,
metropolitan areas, states, the nation and other countries; and
develop forecasts based on historical data.
   The first orders for FEDSTAT have come from such organizations as
the New York Public Library and the Library of Congress. Turner
predicted that within two years, CD-ROM technology will be available
at most university libraries, larger public libraries and 15 to 20
percent of school libraries.
   A new version of the first FEDSTAT disc will be produced each
year, Glimpse said, with partial updates issued on additional discs
throughout the year.

<BYLINE>Commodities Markets Provide Outlet For Wild Financial Speculation</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Commodities exchanges give speculators the opportunity to bet
millions of dollars on the future prices of such goods as soybeans,
gold, Treasury bills and frozen orange juice.
   The purpose of the futures exchanges is to transfer the risk of
price fluctuations from people who don't want the risk _ such as
farmers or metals processors _ to speculators who are willing to
gamble on making big profits.
   Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods
at a specified price at a certain time in the future. Options, which
also are widely traded on the exchanges, give purchasers the right
but not the obligation to buy or sell something at a certain price
within a specified period.
   Commodities traders, standing in recessed ``pits'' and dressed in
brightly colored jackets, shout orders and wave hand signals to each
other in a free- for-all auction of contracts.
   In a typical transaction on a commodities exchange, a farmer who
wants to lock in a guaranteed price for his crop to minimize risk
will promise to deliver 20,000 bushels of soybeans at a specified
future date at a specified price.
   Assuming the price rises, the speculator who buys the contract
could later take the beans from the farmer and resell them to
someone else at the higher prevailing market price, pocketing the
profit.
   But if the price drops, the speculator would lose money by having
to pay the farmer the agreed-upon price and then resell the soybeans
at the lower market price.
   Speculators rarely end up actually holding with mountains of tin
or pork bellies because they sell their positions at a profit or
loss before the delivery date. The ultimate buyer is a customer who
actually needs the commodity.
   Although the exchanges began with agricultural products, they
have rapidly expanded into financial products. For example, the
Chicago Board of Trade does most of its business in contracts based
on the value of the Standard &amp; Poor's 100-stock and 500-stock
indexes.
   Other major exchanges include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Commodity Exchange in New
York, the New York Cotton Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange.

<HEAD>European Commission Unveils New Draft Company Statute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Commission has unveiled a
new draft European company statute aimed at easing business in the
future single European market.
   The new draft, announced Wednesday, is a watered-down version of
the initial proposal, which Britain had strongly opposed.
   EEC Internal Market Commissioner Martin Bangemann said, however,
the statute aims to ensure that workers will be involved in
corporate decision-making, although this had raised Britain's main
objection.
   ``There will be no European company without a definition of the
place of workers in it, and in which way they participate in
decisions,'' Bangemann said.
   The proposal, which has to be approved by the 12 member countries
of the European Economic Community, gives companies the choice of
creating a European company, Bangemann said, without forcing them to
and without replacing national company statutes.
   Companies could create a European company through a merger, a
holding company or a common subsidiary, provided that at least two
of them have their headquarters in different member countries,
Bangemann explained.
   The new proposal lowers the minimum capital of a European company
to 100,000 European currency units, or around $110,000, to allow
small and medium-sized companies to choose the new European statute.
   The draft also contains tax incentives by allowing companies to
offset losses in one member country against profits in another,
although Bangemann said the European Commission did not want the
provision to be reserved only for companies choosing a European
statute.
   The provisions on employee participation would allow EEC
countries, rather than companies, to choose which model to adopt.
This is a change from an earlier proposal which gave companies the
choice.
   The Commission, the EEC's executive body, is offering three
options: appointing workers to supervisory boards following the West
German example; workers' committees as used in France, Belgium,
Italy and the Netherlands; or other models chosen in consultation
with the companies concerned.
   Bangemann said member countries could allow companies to choose
between the three models or limit the choice to one model. He said
West Germany, for example, could limit the choice to the first
option to remain in line with West German law.

<TEXT>
   Fox Inc. says it has created a new company to
oversee its television production activities and has named the head
of a major independent movie studio to run its filmmaking operations
as part of a major restructuring.
   Joe Roth, the creative force behind filmmaker Morgan Creek
Productions, has been appointed chairman of Twentieth Century Fox
Film Corp., Fox announced Wednesday.
   Roth will oversee all of Fox's worldwide motion picture
activities and will be responsible for developing new movie
properties. Fox says it wants to nearly triple its film output.
   Fox also said it has created a new company, Twentieth Television
Corp., to replace the film corporation's television production arm,
which was called 20th Century Fox Television Production.
   Harris Katleman, president the television production division,
will serve as president of the new company.
   The television arm produces the shows ``L.A. Law,'' ``Mr.
Belvedere'' and ``Alien Nation,'' among others.
   The moves were designed to separate the motion picture and
television units, said Barry Diller, chairman of Fox Inc., a unit of
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd.
   ``The separation of our motion picture operations from our
television production and distribution activities will provide the
concentrated effort necessary to achieve our goal of distributing 24
to 30 motion pictures per year throughout the world,'' Diller said
in a statement.
   After finishing third among all studios in 1988, Fox is currently
slumping at the national box office. With the weak showings of this
year's ``Say Anything,'' ``The Fly II'' and ``Skin Deep,'' Fox is
No. 7 of the eight major film studios, according to the trade
newspaper Daily Variety. Fox now claims slightly more than 6 percent
of 1989's box-office receits.
   Fox hopes that ``The Abyss,'' an expensive and much-delayed
underwater adventure movie, will generate robust ticket sales when
it opens next month.
   Roth effectively replaces Leonard Goldberg, who resigned from Fox
in early May to become an independent producer. Diller has been
running the studio in the interim.
   As president of Morgan Creek, Roth produced the films ``Dead
Ringers,'' ``Young Guns,'' ``Skin Deep,'' ``Major League'' and
``Renegades.'' The first three films were distributed theatrically
by Fox, as will be the comedy ``Coupe de Ville,'' which Roth just
finished directing.
   Roth leaves behind the Morgan Creek productions ``Nightbreed,''
``Exorcist: 1990'' and ``Enemies, a Love Story,'' all of which
should be released in coming months.
   In a recent interview explaining the company's successful track
record, Roth said, ``I don't want to get too big, too impersonal.''
   James Robinson, Morgan Creek's chairman and a leading Subaru car
salesman, said that the company will name a new head of production
soon.
   ``Much of Morgan Creek's success is attributable to our
association with Fox,'' Robinson said, ``and we now look forward to
an even stronger working relationship with Fox.''
   Fox Inc. also owns the Fox Television Network, the fledgling
fourth national TV network.

<HEAD>BAT's Stock Falls As Investors Consider Bid's Hurdles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices in BAT Industries PLC dropped as
investors took profits and speculated whether a group led by Sir
James Goldsmith would succeed in its $21 billion hostile bid for the
conglomerate in what would be Europe's largest-ever takeover.
   Possible hurdles could include the reluctance of institutional
shareholders to accept the group's all-debt offer for the
tobacco-retailing giant, scrutiny by the British government and
defensive litigation in the United States, experts said.
   ``An important element is how the government is going to react,''
said Philip Healey, editor of the British publication Aquisitions
Monthly. ``Is it good for the U.K. industry? What benefits will come
out of it besides making three rich men richer?''
   BAT stock fell the equivalent of 37 cents a share to close at
$14.21 Wednesday on the London Stock Exchange, following a
$3.24-a-share runup Tuesday.
   The stock remained above the Goldsmith group's offer of $13.77 a
share in debt securities, indicating speculation that a higher offer
might emerge.
   In the United States, American Depositary Receipts representing
shares of BAT closed at $14.12{, down from $14.37{ Tuesday on the
American Stock Exchange.
   A sweeter offer may rival the record $25 billion purchase of RJR
Nabisco Inc., completed earlier this year by the New York investment
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   BAT's board of directors met Wednesday and afterward reaffirmed
in a statement that it regarded the offer as unwelcome.
   The Anglo-French financier Goldsmith, joined by British merchant
banker Jacob Rothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer,
launched the bid Tuesday morning through a newly formed company,
Hoylake Investments PLC.
   The group said it intended to break up BAT _ the world's biggest
tobacco company _ by selling its non-tobacco interests, which
include financial services, retailing and papermaking.
   Analysts said the bidders could encounter trouble winning over
British institutional investors, who have been hostile toward highly
leveraged offers, or those relying on debt rather than cash or
stock. The bid would require a better price and some cash to
succeed, analysts said, adding they believed Goldsmith's offer was
only an opening shot.
   The takeover also may face an investigation by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission on public interest grounds. Although Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government champions
free-market policies, it has blocked takeovers in the past.
   The government, for example, in March blocked the acquisition of
brewer Scottish and Newcastle PLC by the Australian company Elders
IXL, citing the public interest.
   For the same reason, the government last year ordered Kuwait to
more than halve its 22 percent stake in British Petroleum Co. PLC.
BP subsequently bought the entire holding.
   The offer for BAT also might face legal action in the United
States, where BAT has extensive interests, including Brown &amp;
Williamson Tobacco Corp., Farmers Insurance Group Inc. and the Saks
Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's department stores.
   Earlier this year, South African-controlled Minorco SA's hostile
bid for the British mining giant Consolidated Gold Fields PLC ran
aground in a U.S. court. A New York federal judge, citing antitrust
concerns, issued a temporary restraining order against that bid,
which then expired under British takeover rules.
   Gold Fields since has agreed to be taken over by British
conglomerate Hanson PLC.
   There was some speculation that BAT's management might try a
leveraged buyout, but analysts said the obvious choices for
engineers for such a big deal have their hands quite full.
   In a leveraged buyout, a bidder uses borrowed money to take over
a target and then uses the target's earnings or sells off its pieces
to pay off the debt.
   Kohlberg Kravis, the acknowledged leveraged buyout king, is still
dealing with RJR Nabisco and Wasserstein Perella and Co., another
New York buyout firm, is involved in an offer for Gateway Corp., a
British supermarket operator.

<HEAD>Time Stock Regains Ground As Traders Await Delaware Decision</HEAD>

   Investors bid Time Inc.'s stock higher as they
continued to speculate about how a Delaware judge might rule on the
three-way battle for the media giant.
   Time rose $1.87{ to close at $148.12{ a share Wednesday on the
New York Stock Exchange as Wall Street waited for Chancery Court
Judge William T. Allen's verdict on Paramount Communications Inc.'s
request for an injunction against Time's $14 billion tender offer
for Warner Communications Inc.
   Allen was expected to rule by week's end, before he leaves for a
vacation and before Time's $70-a-share offer for Warner expires at
midnight Monday.
   After Allen heard arguments in the case Tuesday, investor
pessimism about the chances for success of Paramount's $12.2
billion, $200-a-share bid for Time sent Time's stock tumbling $6.37{
a share to $146.25. Analysts said that at under $150 a share, the
stock attracted bargain hunters Wednesday.
   Fred Anschel, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the
market continued to speculate on the outcome of the Delaware court
case.
   If the judge decides in favor of Time, the company plans to allow
its tender offer for Warner to expire as scheduled Monday even if
Paramount appeals to the Delaware Supreme Court.
   Edward Adler, a Time spokesman, said Wednesday he did not
immediately know whether Time would extend the tender offer if the
judge ruled in favor of Paramount.
   It also was not known what Paramount planned to do if Allen
denied its request.
   Paramount stock was up 50 cents to $58.50 a share on the NYSE
Wednesday, while Warner stock fell 37{ cents to $62.50 a share.
   In arguments Tuesday, attorneys for Paramount and some of Time's
shareholders contended that Time's directors violated their duty in
refusing to let shareholders vote on Paramount's bid.
   The lawyers claimed the Time board effectively put the company up
for sale when it agreed to a stock-swap merger with Warner in March.
Under Delaware law, if a company is up for sale, its board must
entertain any bids that would fetch the most money for shareholders.
   Time attorneys dismissed that argument, saying the merger was
simply a business transaction that followed two years of
negotiations.
   Time announced the tender offer for Warner after Paramount
launched its bid.

<HEAD>Bo Slid Through the Hockey Scene in New Nike Ad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baseball All-Star Bo Jackson shows he can handle
a tennis racket, leap above a basketball rim and run like the wind
in a new commercial, but he slid through the hockey scenes in his
socks.
   Jackson put his multiple athletic talents on display in the ad
for shoemaker Nike Inc., which aired for the first time in Tuesday
night's television broadcast of the All-Star Game.
   The 60-second spot opens with shots of Jackson, who plays both
baseball and football professionally, hitting a baseball and eluding
would-be tacklers.
   ``Bo knows baseball,'' says Los Angeles Dodgers star Kirk Gibson
in the commercial. ``Bo knows football,'' adds Los Angeles Rams
quarterback Jim Everett.
   Pro basketball star Michael Jordan, runner Joan Benoit Samuelson,
a professional women's cycling team and a group of bodybuilders also
attest to Jackson's grasp of those sports between clips of Jackson
in action.
   Even John McEnroe manages to say ``Bo knows tennis,'' although it
sounds more like a question than a declaration.
   But after Jackson is shown delivering a devastating check and
manuevering past several hockey players, Los Angeles Kings star
Wayne Gretzky smiles in delivering his one-word assessment: ``No.''
   Nike advertising director Scott Bedbury said Wednesday the hockey
scenes with Jackson actually were shot in a gymnasium in Lawrence,
Kan., where the Nike admakers caught up with the Kansas City Royals
outfielder last spring.
   Bedbury said the actors were in their socks for the scene, not on
skates. ``We didn't think it was worth the risk'' to Jackson to ask
him to perform that scene on ice, where he might risk an injury,
Bedbury said.
   The commercial ends with Jackson trying to play a guitar on stage
along with another famous Bo _ musician Bo Diddley, who composed and
performed the music in the ad.
   As Jackson struggles to make some sweet sounds from his guitar,
Diddley points a finger at him and snaps: ``Bo, you don't know
Diddley.''
   Jackson's baseball, soccer, cycling and running scenes also were
shot in Lawrence, along with scenes to appear in an international
version of the ad that features Jackson playing soccer and cricket.
   Bedbury said instructors who showed Jackson some of the nuances
of cricket were amazed at how far he hit the cricket ball.
   Other scenes for the ad were shot in Orlando, Fla., and Los
Angeles.
   Jim Riswold, a copywriter and associate creative director at
Nike's ad agency, Wieden &amp; Kennedy, said the idea for the commercial
developed over a few beers one February night.
   Nike marketing director Tom Clarke told the group they had to
come up with something new featuring Jackson, who had appeared in
three commercials by himself last year on behalf of Nike's line of
cross-training shoes _ athletic shoes suitable for several sports.
   ``We got off on a discussion of the other Bo's we have all heard
of _ Bo Derek, the Beau Brummels. Somebody mentioned Bo Diddley and
we thought that might be interesting,'' Riswold said.
   Riswold said that with the Jackson-Diddley matchup in mind, he
and art director David Jenkins had no problem developing a rough
outline of the entire commercial the next morning.
   Nike declined to say how much Jackson, Diddley or any of the
other athletes received for appearing in the commercials.
   But Bedbury said all of the athletes except the bodybuilders
already had contracts of some sort with Nike that call for personal
appearances each year. The bodybuilders were recruited off a Los
Angeles-area beach, he said.
   Riswold said he didn't think any of the professionals hesitated
about appearing in an ad starring someone else. ``I think they
enjoyed it. They were being set up as the experts in their fields,''
he said.
   The full 60-second version of the ad is expected to run through
August, when 30-second versions will begin and run through winter.

<HEAD>TVA to Refinance $6.5 Billion in Treasury Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tennessee Valley Authority, operator of the
nation's largest electric power system, said it will refinance $6.5
billion in debt to the federal Treasury by issuing bonds in the
public market for the first time in 15 years.
   The agency expects to save $100 million a year in interest costs
by refinancing.
   Of TVA's total $18.1 billion in long-term debt, $16.7 billion is
held by the Federal Financing Bank, an agency of the Treasury
Department, and the average interest rate on $6.5 billion of the
debt is 12.25 percent, according to William F. Malec, the TVA chief
financial officer.
   Malec said Wednesday the agency expected to pay about a 9 percent
average interest rate on the newly issued debt.
   TVA said it was compelled to go to the public market to raise the
money because the Federal Financing Bank will not lend money for
refinancing.
   TVA, based in Knoxville, Tenn., provides electricity to about 8
million people in parts of Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky,
Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.

<HEAD>House Approves Expansion of Protected Coastal Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An effort to sharply limit oil drilling off the
U.S. coast, spurred by the Exxon Valdez disaster, is headed to the
Senate with a strong voice of approval from the House.
   The House on Wednesday approved the most extensive ban on
offshore oil leasing of the decade, widely expanding prohibitions
for one year against drilling off large portions of the Atlantic,
Pacific and Alaska coasts.
   ``Those people who have allied themselves with the oil industry
understand how dramatic a statement this is now,'' Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., said before the vote.
   The one-year moratorium was part of the $11 billion Interior
Department appropriation bill, which was approved 374-49. There was
no separate vote on the oil leasing provision.
   The Senate has not voted on the Interior appropriation and
several senators plan to introduce similar prohibitions.
   The Bush administration opposes the expanded prohibitions.
   Under the House bill, leases for offshore oil drilling would be
banned in areas off the coasts of California, Florida, a stretch of
the Atlantic Ocean between Maine and Maryland and, for the first
time, off part of Alaska's coast.
   The appropriations bill sets spending by the Interior Department
and related agencies for fiscal 1990, and the provision prohibits
appropriated money from being used to lease or approve oil drilling
or exploration in the areas during the year.
   Miller and other legislators are seeking to permanently ban
drilling in some areas of the outer continental shelf.
   ``This moratorium will provide needed breathing room to enact the
stronger safeguard I have proposed of a 10-year moratorium,'' said
Rep. Jim Courter, R-N.J.
   Support for limits on offshore oil exploration has grown since
the March disaster in which the tanker Exxon Valdez spilled 1.6
million gallons of oil into the pristine Prince William Sound water
off the Alaska coast.
   Smaller tanker accidents over one weekend last month spilled oil
into water off the Texas, Delaware and Rhode Island coasts.
   The American Petroleum Institute, the major industry trade group,
called the House vote ``a tragedy for our nation.''
   ``In an emotional reaction to tanker oil spills, the House has
taken an action that will inevitably boomerang,'' the institute said
in a statement. ``Tanker traffic bringing imported oil into U.S.
waters will have to increase as domestic oil production continues to
decline.''
   In a June 29 letter to House Appropriations leaders,
administration budget director Richard Darman said the oil leasing
provision and the bill's total budget, which is $2.45 billion more
than Bush requested, are the main reasons the White House opposes
the bill.
   The administration also objects to a ``buy America'' provision
that requires offshore oil and gas rigs to be constructed with at
least 50 percent U.S. labor and materials.

   Share prices were weaker but off their minimum
levels around midday Thursday, as profit-taking crept into the
market before the end of the current two-week trading account on
Friday.
   London's Stock Exchange divides trading into two-week and
three-week trading periods for accounting purposes.
   Dealers said there wasn't any concerted selling pressure. ``You'd
have to be a fool to take a short (position) with all the bids on
the table at the moment, and the possibility of a few more,'' one
market maker said.
   A host of rumors were making the rounds, highlighting a number of
stocks, dealers said.
   At about noon, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was 7.6 points, or 0.3 percent, weaker at 2,249.1, just a shade
below its best level for the day of 2,249.4. The index sunk as low
as 2,242.9 during the morning before rebounding to its current level.
   Volume amounted to a moderate 318.4 million shares at midday
compared with 539.1 million shares at the same time Wednesday.

<HEAD>Northwest Airlines Pilots Threaten Preparatory Strike Action</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union representing Northwest Airlines
pilots says it will ask a federal mediator to call an impasse in
talks with the airline, paving the way for a possible strike, if
substantial progress in talks isn't made by Friday.
   ``Twenty-eight months in negotiations is probably long enough to
conclude a contract,'' pilot spokesman Curt Kruse of the
5,000-member Air Line Pilots Association said Wednesday.
   ``We are getting the feeling that management is stringing us
along and trying to make this last as long as possible,'' Kruse said.
   But Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons denied the allegation.
   ``The goal is to get a contract, not string anybody along,''
Gibbons said. ``As along as both sides are talking we can move
toward an agreement.''
   The union's harsh talk came after the pilots and Northwest
negotiators met Wednesday for the second time this week. Northwest
and the union have tentatively settled hundreds of issues in the the
past two months but are still at odds over the hard issues _ wages,
job security, work rules and insurance.
   Former Republic Airlines pilots and original Northwest pilots are
still working under separate agreements even though the two airlines
combined operations nearly three years ago.
   ``The result is that our membership becomes increasingly
frustrated,'' Kruse said. ``They want a showdown with management.''
   Under federal labor law, only the National Mediation Board can
declare an impasse in airline negotiations. If the board declares an
impasse, a 30-day cooling-off period begins. After the end of the
cooling-off period, the union is free to strike and the company can
implement its final offer.
   Kruse said if substantial movement doesn't occur in the
negotiations, the union strike committee will ask the union's master
executive councils to obtain airport permits for informational
picketing.

<HEAD>Pepsico Chairman Says ``Guerrilla Warfare'' Needed Against Coke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pepsico Inc. Chairman D. Wayne Calloway said
Thursday his firm needs to resort to guerrilla tactics to make an
appreciable dent in Coca-Cola's share of the Japanese soft drink
market.
   Coca-Cola dominates Japan's cola market with a 92 percent share,
compared with Pepsi's 6 percent, according to food and beverage
industry statistics.
   ``When you have as strong a share as Coca-Cola, that calls for
guerrilla warfare,'' Calloway said. That means ``chipping away at
the convenience store chains, store by store, vending machine by
vending machine,'' he said.
   Pepsico also owns the Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Taco
Bell restaurant chains, and the snack food company Frito Lay. Pepsi
Cola has been successful in other countries, such as the Soviet
Union, where it has 21 bottling plants and contracts for 20 more.
   But gaining market share in Japan ``is trench warfare, store by
store, pizza by pizza. It's that kind of business,'' Calloway told
reporters over a hotel-catered lunch of consomme Mille Fanti and
filet steak au poivre.
   Pepsico was a sponsor for the worldwide tour of pop superstar
Michael Jackson, who performed in Japan in 1987 and 1988. Those
visits boosted Pepsi Cola sales in Japan briefly to 12-15 percent of
the cola market, but they fell back each time.
   ``Coca-Cola says Japan is its most profitable market,'' Calloway
said. ``That says you're up against a pretty formidable force.'' He
said problems remain with brand recognition and the complex Japanese
distribution system.
   ``We're not going to go out and do something crazy,'' he said.
``There is no silver bullet, no bomb we can drop.''
   But he said Pepsico would keep up steady efforts at market
penetration, including increasing local retail outlets and investing
in vending machines.
   Pepsico also is expanding into non-carbonated drinks such as
fruit juices, sports drinks and coffee, Calloway said.
   ``We're not the market leader so we can't afford to do a lot of
advertising and marketing. We have to do it in a controlled manner.
If I went out and matched Coca-Cola's spending here, unless you have
the distributors and the vendors, it won't help.''
   Pepsico's other ventures in Japan have fared better. Kentucky
Fried Chicken, a joint venture with the trading giant Mitsubishi
Corp., has cornered 98 percent of this country's fried chicken
market, according to Shinsuke Ohkawara, president of Kentucky Fried
Chicken Japan, who accompanied Calloway.
   Kentucky Fried Chicken has 834 outlets in Japan, the largest
Western-style restaurant chain in this country, and projected sales
of $863 million this year, Ohkawara said.
   By the end of the year Pepsico will have 18,000 restaurants
worldwide, the largest restaurant chain in the world, and directly
own or operate 40 percent of them, with the rest franchises or joint
ventures, Calloway said.
   By contrast, the McDonald's fast-food chain has some 11,000
outlets worldwide, with 20 percent of them directly operated, he
said.

   Britain's unemployment rate fell to a seasonally

said Thursday.
   The latest rate was the lowest since October 1980, and compared

   The number of jobless people fell 26,500. The financial markets

   The number of unemployed, without seasonal adjustment, was 1.74
million people in June, compared with a 1.80 million in May and 2.34

<HEAD>EDs: SUBS 8th graf, That would, to include amount of mortgage in

<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homeowners seeking to take advantage of falling
interest rates this summer should be able to refinance their
mortgages faster and more cheaply under a new program offered by the
nation's largest mortgage buyer.
   The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae,
said Wednesday the changes would offer lower closing costs and
speedier approval to homeowners replacing fixed- or adjustable-rate
mortgages with new fixed-rate loans.
   ``What we're trying to do here is grease the skids and make it
easier for people to refinance,'' said economist David W. Berson of
Fannie Mae, a congressionally-chartered, shareholder-owned company
that provides money for home buyers by purchasing mortgages from
lenders and packaging them into securities for sale to investors.
   Lenders are anticipating a surge in refinancing this summer
because fixed-rate mortgages have fallen by about 1\ percentage
points since March and are expected to fall by another quarter of a
point by fall.
   Fixed rates are below 10 percent for the first time in more than
a year. One-year adjustable rates have edged down in recent months,
but not by as much, and still are about a percentage point higher
than a year ago.
   Berson said he expected roughly 300,000 homeowners to refinance
in the July-September quarter. He said about $90 billion in
fixed-rate mortgages would be written in the quarter and between 25
percent to 35 percent of those likely would be refinancings. Fannie
Mae helps finance one of every eight mortgages.
   Much of this summer's refinancing activity will come from
homeowners who took out discounted, adjustable-rate mortgages and
are now facing higher payments. For instance, home buyers who took
out an adjustable-rate mortgage at a 7{ percent rate in 1987 are
probably now paying 11{ percent.
   That would, on average, increase their monthly principal and
interest payments on a $100,000 mortgage from $699 two years ago to
$990 now. Refinancing to a fixed-rate mortgage at 9} percent would
lower the payment to $859.
   During the last refinancing boom in 1986 and 1987, homeowners
often had to wait three months before getting approval for their new
loans, Berson said. The waiting period has dropped to about six
weeks and the company's new program could shorten the process by
another week or two, he said.
   With certain restrictions, Fannie Mae will waive a new home
appraisal, saving homeowners several hundred dollars. In that case,
the new loan must come from the original mortgage lender. However,
the waiver will not apply if the current loan is backed by the
Veterans Administration or Federal Housing Administration.
   Also, Fannie Mae for many loans will not require borrowers to go
through another credit and income check. Those loans must be for a
one- or two-family main residence or a second home. The new mortgage
must not exceed 90 percent of the home's value, or 95 percent with
mortgage insurance.
   Homeowners will not be allowed to take more than 1 percent of the
new loan in cash. They will be permitted to borrow the money to pay
for the closing fees of the new loan, thus eliminating most up-front
costs.

<HEAD>Midway Expansion May Open Jobs For Striking Eastern Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expansion of Midway Airlines, which is trying to
acquire jets, routes and gates from Eastern Airlines, may provide
jobs for strike-weary workers, the chairman of the Chicago-based
carrier said.
   David Hinson, Midway chairman and chief executive officer, said
Wednesday the carrier should sign a $206.5 million agreement next
week for 16 Eastern planes, two Canadian routes and 13 gates at
Philadelphia International Airport, which Midway plans to develop
into its East Coast hub.
   By the mid-1990s, Hinson said Midway hopes to have more than
1,000 employees in Philadelphia and operate routes from Canada to
the Caribbean.
   ``The former Eastern workers are high-quality professionals that
we would give top priority to hire under the appropriate
circumstances,'' said Hinson in a visit to Miami International
Airport, where Midway operates its principal maintenance facilities.
   Midway has hired nine former Eastern pilots since machinists,
pilots and flight attendants at the Miami-based airline went on
strike March 4.
   The Midway deal is part of Eastern's strategy to significantly
downsize operations from its pre-strike level of more than 1,000
flights. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland in New York must
approve the agreement.
   Eastern, which filed for bankruptcy protection March 9, has
already sold its profitable Northeast Shuttle to billionaire Donald
Trump for $365 million and has announced plans to sell at least 20
more jets.
   While Eastern considers relocating its headquarters to Atlanta,
Hinson said Midway's expansion plans could more than double flights
into Miami.
   If the Philadelphia deal is approved, Midway may have up to five
flights a day to Miami from Chicago and Philadelphia, said Hinson.
The airline, which acquired bankrupt Air Florida as it expanded to a
national carrier during the past decade, also holds several of Air
Florida's former Latin American and Caribbean routes, which Hinson
said may be used after the Philadelphia hub is established.
   Midway currently flies via Miami to Nassau, Bahamas, and the U.S.
Virgin Islands.
   The East Coast service would put Midway in direct competition
with USAir, the Northeast's largest carrier, which first sought
Eastern's Philadelphia gates and routes.
   ``USAir is a formidable competitor and we have our work cut out
for us to move into their territory,'' Hinson said.
   Hinson, who predicted more airline bankruptcies before the
industry settles, said the Philadelphia expansion will be steady but
not overly aggressive.
   ``We're generally a conservative company,'' said Hinson, a former
Northwest Airlines co-pilot. ``We are not out to roll the dice.''
   Often dubbed ``the darling of deregulation,'' Midway was the
first carrier chartered after government control of the industry
ended in 1979 and began as a small Midwest carrier catering to
full-fare business travelers. By the early 1980s, it was losing more
than $20 million annually and began courting regular passengers soon
after acquiring Air Florida in late 1984.
   Midway operates more than 220 regular and commuter flights to 51
cities from Midway Airport south of Chicago. The carrier inaugurated
West Coast service this spring and made a $900 million order for 37
jets from McDonnell Douglas Corp. with an option for 37 more.
   For the first quarter, Midway reported record earnings of $2.9
million, but profits have been erratic in recent years, dropping
more than 40 percent last year.
   On Wednesday, Midway announced a tentative labor agreement with
the Teamsters, representing more than 450 mechanics, stock clerks
and aircraft cleaners.

   Hasbro Inc. plans to begin producing
popular Cabbage Patch Kids dolls immediately now that it has
completed the purchase of most product lines from financially
troubled Coleco Industries Inc., the company says.
   Hasbro, the nation's largest toymaker, completed its purchase of
Coleco's major assets on Wednesday for $85 million cash and an
option for Coleco to purchase 1 million shares of Hasbro at $28.85
after its bankruptcy plan was confirmed, said Barry Alperin,
Hasbro's executive vice president.
   Hasbro closed at $20 on the American Exchange Wednesday, down 25
cents.
   The Pawtucket-based company said it had reached agreement with
Original Appalachian Artworks, owner and creator of Cabbage Patch
Kids, to begin manufacturing the dolls immediately, in time to
advertise them for Christmas.
   The dolls would be made overseas and packaged at Hasbro's Milton
Bradley division in East Longmeadow, Mass., Alperin said. Most of
Coleco's other lines, including Scrabble, Parcheesi, Perfection and
Aggravation, also would be produced in Massachusetts.
   ``Milton Bradley ... has the capacity there and they've handled
things like this before,'' Alperin said.
   Hasbro also bought the right to use Coleco's name and would
discontinue some of its products, including Alf and Wrinkles,
Alperin said.
   Chairman Alan G. Hassenfeld said the acquisition would add ``some
time-tested products which will enrich Hasbro's three divisions
without material additions to our cost structure.''
   Hasbro's third division is Playskool.
   ``We will be putting on some people to handle Cabbage Patch, but
we're talking tens or twentys,'' Alperin said. ``These are short
term decisions and we'll deal with this on a long term basis as we
get into it.''
   Alperin said the Cabbage Patch line, which was the largest
selling toy of all time in 1985, ``has not had the attention it
deserved over the past couple of years.''
   Sales of Cabbage Patch peaked at more than $600 million in 1985,
compared with $58 million last year.
   But the transaction's success does not rest solely on Cabbage
Patch products, Alperin said. Some of the board games, for example,
``are tried and true names in the games field,'' he said.
   Alperin would not release internal figures estimating projected
revenues for the new products.
   Coleco is far from Hasbro's most ambitious purchase. It aqcuired
Milton Bradley in 1984 for more than $350 million, Alperin said.
   The Connecticut-based Coleco filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act a year ago,
citing debts of $540.3 million.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rosemary T. McFadden, the highest ranking woman
in the futures industry, has resigned as president of the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the Merc's board of directors announced
Thursday.
   McFadden, a lawyer, has headed the Merc since 1984.
   After her resignation takes effect at the end of the month,
McFadden will serve as a special advisor to the Exchange and consult
with the board on long-term strategic issues, said NYMEX Chairman Z.
Lou Guttman in a statement.
   Guttman said the reorganization is ``designed to make the
Exchange even more effective and responsive to the challenges of the
future.''
   But unidentified sources cited in Thursday's Wall Street Journal
said McFadden was being pressured to resign because of long-standing
policy disputes. The paper did not identify what specific issues
were involved.
   ``The NYMEX board feels that I can better serve the Exchange in
my new strategic advisory capacity,'' McFadden said in the
statement. ``I look forward to that opportunity.''
   During her tenure, the number of contracts traded on the exchange
jumped from 5 million in 1984 to 34 million in 1988. In addition,
the exchange also added contracts for crude, heating oil and
gasoline options as well as a propane futures contract.
   R.P. Thompson, currently executive vice president, will continue
his role as senior exchange official, the statement said.

   The stock market declined slightly today, pausing
after Wednesday's rise to new post-crash highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.66 to 2,529.97
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 425 up, 504 down and
539 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.86 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders had grown leery of chasing after stocks
following the market's latest rally, which produced gains in each of
the first seven sessions of July.
   Wall Streeters were looking ahead to several economic reports due
from the government on Friday, including monthly statistics on
industrial production and the producer price index of finished goods.
   The figures are expected to provide further confirmation that
economic growth is slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   Investors will give especially close scrutiny to the report on
producer prices which, if it lives up to its advance billing, will
show a slackening of inflationary pressures.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down \ at 114{; General Electric, down [ at 54\;
International Paper, down [ at 47}, and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, down [ at 36].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .22 to 183.93. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .40 at 366.78.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.02 to
2,532.63, surpassing its previous post-crash peak of 2,531.87 on
June 23.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 832 up, 603 down and 526 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 160.55 million shares, against 171.59
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Five Companies in Running for Soviet Space Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five U.S. companies are vying to place ads
costing more than $1 million on the side of a Soviet space shuttle
scheduled for launch next month, according to a company with
exclusive rights to sell the advertising.
   San Francisco-based Soviet-Pacific Enterprises would only
identify the five as a major oil company, a television network, an
international courier, a consumer-goods produce and a food company.
   The ads, printed on thin plastic-like film stuck on the spaceship
with an adhesive, will disintegrate within 45 seconds of launch
because of the heat generated as the craft cuts through the earth's
atmosphere.
   Talks with the five companies are now in the final stages, said
Sam Hollis Jr., marketing director for Soviet-Pacific.
   ``But we're looking for just one sponsor,'' he said. Hollis said
his company doesn't want the space ship to ``look like an
Indianapolis 500 race car with 500 different advertisements.''
   For a payment estimated at more than $1 million, the company that
is picked will be allowed to place two 10-by-21-foot signs on the
side of the Soyuz shuttle, scheduled for launch Aug. 30. It also can
display its corporate logo or advertisements around the Baikonur
launch site and send a camera crew to film the August lift-off.
   The Soviet space agency, Glavkosmos, and Licensintorg, the
commercial-space and licensing agency in the USSR, have imposed only
one restriction, said Hollis. They won't allow sponsorship by liquor
or tobacco companies.
   More than 100 million people in the Soviet Union are expected to
view a live broadcast of the blastoff, presenting an ideal
opportunity to a company that wants to introduce a new product in
that nation.
   Less than 45 seconds might seem short for a million dollars, but
a company spokesman pointed out that a 60-second spot during a Super
Bowl broadcast costs more than that.
   Glavkosmos has signed commerical agreements with several Western
companies.
   In March, a Japanese televison network paid the agency $12
million for the right to send a correspondent into space in 1991.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which
administers the U.S. space program, does not accept advertising or
payment from private citizens for flights.
   In the past, U.S. space shuttles have carried some projects for a
fee, but that practice was canceled after the Challenger explosion
in 1986 that killed seven astronauts.

<HEAD>EEC Clears Film Distribution Venture of U.S. Film Makers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community
commission said Thursday it had cleared a film distribution venture
by three U.S. companies after they agreed to amend their pact to
comply with EEC antitrust rules.
   The commission said that the agreement between Paramount Pictures
Corp., MCA Inc. and MGM-UA Communications to create a joint venture,
United International Pictures, to distribute their films in the EEC
had contained exclusivity clauses which restricted competition.
   These clauses were changed so that the venture now only has the
right of first refusal on the parent companies' films. This means
that if United International chooses not to distribute a film, the
parent company could distribute it on its own or through a third
party.
   The companies also agreed to maintain ``appropriate records'' and
to establish an arbitration procedure to solve problems such as film
allocation and access to screen space, the commission said.
   The commission's clearance lasts for five years, after which it
will review the companies' agreement.
   It said the changes to the agreement were designed to ensure that
the parent companies remained autonomous and that the films were
distributed as widely as possible.

<HEAD>Quaker Announces More Than 500 Staff Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Quaker Oats Co. plans to lay off more than 550
workers nationwide by next spring, the company says.
   An Ohio pet food plant that employs 390 people will be closed by
next spring, and 170 management workers nationwide will be laid off
in the next few weeks, Quaker said in a statement Wednesday.
   The management layoffs will trim 42 employees from Quaker's
Chicago headquarters. The rest of the cuts will be among sales,
manufacturing and distribution workers in the company's U.S. grocery
products division, said spokesman Ronald Botrell.
   The layoffs were announced to employees Wednesday, Botrell said.
   The company said in a statement that the plant in Marion, Ohio,
which produces Ken-L-Ration and Puss-N-Boots dog and cat foods, will
be closed in phases between the end of this year and next spring
   ``It's always difficult to make these types of decisions when it
affects loyal and dedicated employees,'' William Smithburg, chairman
and chief executive, said in a statement. ``But for competitive
reasons, we felt it necessary to take these steps.''
   Quaker said the actions would force the company to take a
one-time charge of $104 million, or 80 cents per share. A change in
accounting methods for grocery products inventories will force
another 20- to 25-cent-per-share charge.
   Those charges, coupled with a $21 million, 20-cent-per-share loss
by the European pet foods group mean the company will take losses of
more than $1.20 per share in the fiscal year ended June 30.
   The company said the plant closing was due to declining
popularity of semi-moist and canned pet foods made in Marion. The
products will continue to be made at plants in Kankakee, Ill., and
in Lawrence and Topeka, Kan.
   The company also announced that Philip A. Marineau had been
appointed to the post of executive vice president for U.S. grocery
products. Michael J. Callahan will take Marineau's old position as
executive vice president for international grocery products.

<HEAD>FTC Concerns Delay Pennwalt-Elf Aquitane Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission has put the
brakes on the proposed $1.05 billion acquisition of Pennwalt Corp.
by a French-government controlled oil and chemical concern, the
companies said.
   In a joint release Wednesday, the companies said the FTC had
postponed a decision about the deal until antitrust concerns were
resolved.
   Neither Pennwalt nor the French company, Societe Nationale Elf
Aquitaine, would elaborate on the FTC concerns.
   ``We are concerned in that we want to go ahead with the
transaction as soon as we are allowed to,'' said Lowell Williams, an
Elf Aquitaine spokesman. ``I don't think it's unusual, and you can't
always expect the government to agree with you. We are taking all
reasonable efforts to get the situation cleared up.''
   Susan Ticknor, an FTC spokeswoman, said she could neither confirm
nor deny any investigation of the deal. However, she said that in
general, companies often give the FTC more time to review a proposed
deal _ especially when they feel the FTC decision could be negative.
   Donald Pattison, a chemical industry analyst with Cyrus J.
Lawrence Morgan Grenfel Inc. in New York, said Wednesday the FTC was
worried the merger would make the company too strong in the
flourocarbon business.
   ``From what I've heard, the FTC is worried that a merger would
make Elf No. 3 in the world in flourocarbons, next to Du Pont and
Allied,'' he said. ``They are concerned that the entire market would
be in the hands of three giants.''
   Pennwalt stock tumbled Wednesday with news of the delay, trading
as low as $118.50 and closing on the New York Stock Exchange at
$124, down 25 cents from Tuesday. Elf Aquitaine's offer is worth
$132 a share.
   In their statement, the companies said the postponement was to
``permit Elf Aquitaine and Pennwalt to pursue discussion with the
staff of the Federal Trade Commission concering the possibility of
entering into an agreement which would address certain concerns
raised by the staff with respect to the proposed transaction.''
   Elf Aquitaine also announced it had extended to 5 p.m. July 21
the expiration date on its takeover offer for Pennwalt stock. The
offer has been extended regularly since the companies agreed to
merge on March 20.
   The management of the 139-year-old, Philadelphia-based
pharmaceutical company agreed in the spring to merge with Elf
Aquitaine after rebuffing offers from Centaur Partners of New York.

<HEAD>Coca-Cola Reports 2nd Quarter Earnings Up 14 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. today reported a 14 percent increase
in its second-quarter profit, partly reflecting good returns from
investments in its soft drink operations, bottling joint ventures
and marketing.
   Coke said its after-tax income came to $345.5 million, or 98
cents a share, in 1989's second quarter, up from $303.1 million, or
82 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue for the latest quarter rose 5 percent to $2.4 billion
from $2.3 billion.
   International shipments of concentrate and syrup continued to
grow at a greater rate than domestic shipments, Coke reported.
   Concentrate and syrup shipments outside the United States
advanced 15 percent for the quarter, compared to 3 percent at home.
The biggest jump was in Latin America, for which the company
credited successful marketing activities in Brazil and continued
infrastructure development combined with the increased affordability
of Coca-Cola products in Mexico.
   In the United States, the company said, growth was led by the
continued momentum of its diet Coke and caffeine-free diet Coke
brands.
   ``Our investment in bottling joint ventures, soft drink
infrastructure, and marketing continue to provide substantial
worldwide volume, market share and profit gains,'' Coke Chairman
Roberto C. Goizueta said in a news release.
   ``These investments produce consistently attractive returns and
support our expectations for strong bottom-line performance for the
remainder of the year,'' Goizueta said.
   For the first half of the year, Coke's income was $605.3 million,
or $1.70 a share, which was a 17.9 percent increase over $513.6
million, or $1.39 a share, in the first six months of 1988.
   Revenue rose 5.5 percent to $4.4 billion in the first half from
$4.2 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>EEC Slaps Provisional Anti-dumping Duties On Asian Compact Disc Players</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EEC Commission Thursday imposed
provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of compact disc players
from Japan and South Korea because they may threaten the survival of
the EEC industry.
   The duties, which range from 6.4 percent to 33.9 percent, hit
major Japanese consumer electronics companies including Sony Corp.,
Sanyo Electric Co., Pioneer Electronic Corp. and Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co.
   Major South Korean companies affected include Goldstar Co. and
Samsung Electronics Co.
   The duties, which take effect next week but must be ratified by
the EEC Council of Ministers within three months, followed a
two-year investigation by the EEC after it received a complaint by
the main EEC producers of compact disc players.
   These are NV Philips of the Netherlands, Bang &amp; Olufsen of
Denmark and Grundig AG of West Germany.
   In a statement, the commission said that the CD player imports
``seriously held back the development of the Community industry, the
main inventor and the major developer of the product.''
   It added that most of the Japanese and all of the South Korean
companies involved ``adopted marketing and pricing policies in clear
violation'' of international trading rules on dumping, or selling at
below market price.
   The commission calculates whether dumping occurs by comparing the
price on the exporter's domestic market with the price charged in
the 12-nation trade bloc.
   The commission said that it found CD player dumping ``margins''
of between 1.54 percent and 45.54 percent in the case of the
Japanese exports and of between 20.1 percent and 32.5 percent for
the Korean exports.
   It said that the low prices of the imports caused ``an important
price depression'' which resulted in ``severe'' losses for EEC
producers, which lost about 30 percent of their annual revenue.
   The EEC inquiry covered the period June 1, 1986 to May 31, 1987,
although sales of the players started in 1984.
   The commission did not give a total value of the EEC market for
CD players although it said that the imports in 1987, which made up
about two-thirds of the market, were valued at 300 million European
currency units, or about $33 million.
   Imports surged 23-fold to about 2.3 million units in 1987 from
97,924 units in 1984 of which more than 90 percent came from Japan.
This compared with a fivefold increase in EEC producers' sales, the
commission said. It did not give figures for sales by EEC producers.
   The market share of Japanese and South Korean exporters rose to
more than 75 percent in 1987 from just under 50 percent in 1984,
while the share of the EEC industry fell from more than 50 percent
to 18 percent in 1987, the commission said.
   The EEC investigated 14 producers of CD players but imposed
duties on 11 of them.
   The duties on the companies are as follows:
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 33.9 percent; Pioneer
Electronic Corp., 28.8 percent; Sanyo Electric Co., 27.8 percent;
Yamaha Corp., 23.7 percent; Victor Co. of Japan (JVC), 20.9 percent;
Kenwood Corp., 19.3 percent; Nippon Columbia Co., 17.5 percent; Sony
Corp., 15.9 percent; Onkyo Corp., 8.5 percent; Funai Electric
Trading Co., 8.4 percent; Teac Corp., 6.4 percent.
   Duties also were imposed on four South Korean companies: Inkel
Corp., 20.1 percent; Goldstar Co., 32.5 percent; Samsung Electronics
Co., 23 percent and Haitai Electronics Co., 21.3 percent.
   An official, who asked not to be named, at Sony Belgium NV,
Sony's Belgian subsidiary, said that Sony was not so concerned by
the duties because its factory in Colmar, France had been producing
between 75 percent and 80 percent of Sony's CD players for the EEC
market since 1988.
   He said that the factory was not established to avoid paying
duties but was in line with Sony's policy of making products in the
company's local markets.
   NV Philips was unavailable for comment.

<HEAD>Crop Report Sends Soybeans Up, Wheat Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose in early trading today
on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to a bullish government
crop report while wheat futures fell and corn futures were mixed.
   The soybean market's strongest gains were in the new-crop
contracts, for late summer and autumn delivery, following an
Agriculture Department report that indicated farmers planted fewer
soybeans than the market had expected.
   Slight gains were posted in the July soybean contract, which is
under heavy pressure due to an exchange order requiring traders to
reduce their holdings. The unusual order was seen as a move to block
one player's attempt to corner the market.
   The USDA report, released Wednesday afternoon, pegged planted
corn acreage at a higher-than-expected level and also showed
higher-than-expected winter wheat production.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.86{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents
lower to 1\ cents higher with July at $2.57 a bushel; oats were {
cent to 2 cents higher with July at $1.44\ a bushel; soybeans were {
cent to 8{ cents higher with July up { cent at $6.87 a bushel and
August up 8{ cents at $6.73 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher, with cattle futures up
sharply in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .95 cent higher with August at 71.70
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to 1.05 cents higher with
August at 82.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .68 cent
higher with July at 47.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.20 cent to .55 cent higher with July at 29.30 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Wednesday while pork futures
were mixed.

   ConAgra Inc. said today it had elected Philip
B. Fletcher president and chief operating officer of the
multibillion-dollar diversified food interest.
   Fletcher will be the first person to serve in the job alone in
more than 10 years.
   The company has had a five-member Office of the President, which
will continue under Fletcher, said Walt Casey, a company spokesman.
   ``We haven't had a single president and chief operating officer
since probably 1976,'' Casey said.
   The change also means Fletcher, 56, and ConAgra Chairman Charles
M. Harper, 61, will form the executive office of the company in what
Casey described as a strengthening of the management structure.
   ``Our management and board believe it was an appropriate move to
help strengthen ConAgra for continued progress toward our
objectives,'' he said. ``As the companies grow, we'll look for
different ways to strengthen our management structure.''
   Harper said Fletcher was eminently qualified for his new job.
   ``He has 31 years of highly successful experience in the food
industry, including the last eight years in senior management with
ConAgra,'' Harper said.
   Fletcher, who joined ConAgra in 1982 as president of Banquet
Foods Co., has been president and chief operating officer of ConAgra
Prepared Foods Cos. and a member of the Office of the President
since 1987.
   ConAgra's board of directors also added Fletcher and Kenneth W.
Monfort to the company's board, increasing the number of directors
to 12.
   Monfort, 60, retired from ConAgra on May 31 as president and
chief operationg officer of ConAgra Red Meat Cos. and had been a
member of ConAgra's Office of the President.
   ConAgra is a diversified food company headquartered in Omaha that
had sales exceeding $11 billion for the fiscal year that ended May
1989.

<TEXT>
   General Motors' Saturn Corp. today
announced 33 more dealers to sell its new automobiles beginning in
the fall of 1990.
   About 75 or 80 dealers in 38 large markets are expected by the
time the Saturn cars are introduced next year, officials said.
   ``With the signing of these dealers today, Saturn now has a
strong and geographically diverse base of 59 dealers across the
country,'' said Donald W. Hudler, Saturn vice president of sales.
   Hudler also showed a model of the dealerships that will be used
to create a uniform Saturn image at the 800 locations expected by
the mid-1990s.
   ``If a Saturn customer for Los Angeles moves to Boston and should
need service or want to purchase another car, he or she will be able
to identify a Saturn dealership with ease,'' Hudler said.
   Ground breaking for the first 90 to 100 facilities is expected by
early 1990, with completion about ten months later.
   There were no new Tennessee franchises announced. Lee Beaman,
president of Beaman Automotive Group in Nashville, is the only
Tennessee dealership awarded a franchise so far.
   Saturn will offer two four-door models and one two-door car in
the subcompact or compact segment of the market. GM officials have
said the car will compete with imports.

<HEAD>Nissan Appeals Labor Department Citation, Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. USA said
it will appeal a state Department of Labor citation and $5,000 fine
for refusing to release worker injury logs from its Smyrna plant.
   Nissan lawyers informed state Labor Commissioner Jim White of the
decision on Wednesday.
   The Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined
the company $5,000 on June 22 over the Japanese automaker's refusal
to release copies of its ``OSHA 200'' worker injury records. TOSHA
had given Nissan 20 days to respond to the citation and fine.
   ``We've entered into the appeals process. The contestment now
goes through the TOSHA review procedures,'' state Labor Department
spokeswoman Nancy McNulty said.
   The matter will be examined by the state TOSHA Review Commission,
an unbiased third party that will decide if the citation should be
upheld or rule that Nissan may keep the records secret, Ms. McNulty
said.
   If state labor lawyers and Nissan attorneys fail to reach
agreement, the issue will go before an administrative law judge.
State labor lawyers have said the appeals process could take up to
six months.
   Worker safety and assembly line speed have emerged as the key
issues in the United Auto Workers efforts to organize Nissan's
Smyrna plant. About 2,400 production workers will vote July 26-27 on
whether they want to be represented by the United Auto Workers.
   ``I'm not surprised that Nissan has appealed the case. The OSHA
logs will show that they have a very high injury rate and that the
company has misled the employees and the public as to the working
conditions at the plant,'' UAW spokesman Maxey Irwin said today.

   Violence flared anew on mining picket lines today with the
president of a Kentucky coal company hospitalized after being hit in
the face with a rock. Miners in West Virginia were arrested by the
vanload for blocking a bridge.
   The incidents came one day after the United Mine Workers union
extended a contractually allowed three-day work stoppage for two
more days.
   ``There is a total state of chaos. This state is out of
control,'' said Deborah Herdon, spokeswoman for an A.T. Massey Coal
Co. subsidiary in Beckley, W.Va.
   The UMW went on strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc. on April
5 and wildcat pickets began demonstrations on June 12. By the time
the work stoppage began Monday, at least 37,000 miners were off the
job in eight states.
   West Virginia state police went on ``Stage 4'' alert today,
meaning troopers were put on round-the-clock duty and had days off
canceled.
   Col. Jack Buckalew, state police superintendent, said he issued
the alert ``to have the manpower available should it be needed''
during the stoppage. All 486 troopers were placed on alert.
   Herndon said Charles Snavely, president of A.T. Massey subsidiary
Sidney Coal Co. in Kentucky's Pike County, was hospitalized this
morning after he was hit in the face with a rock.
   More than 200 pickets blocked the entrance to Sidney Coal,
throwing rocks at cars, state police said. They said one injury was
reported but they had no details. There were no immediate arrests.
   In Prenter, W.Va., about 400 UMW members and supporters blocked a
road leading to non-union Elk Run Coal Co. today, saying they would
not move until arrested.
   More than 30 miners had been arrested before noon, said state
police spokesman Ric Robinson. ``We're arresting them literally by
the vanload,'' he said.
   The protesters are upset with what they say is the constant
traffic by coal trucks over Sand Lick Bridge, which they say has a
12-ton weight limit.
   Ronald Guthrie, a laid-off miner who lives near the bridge, said
the empty coal trucks weigh up to 19 tons, and when loaded weigh 70
to 80 tons.
   Also today, officials at Hampden Coal Co. in Gilbert, W.Va., said
five of their trucks and a guardhouse at its mine were fired upon
Wednesday and a fire was started at the mine gate.
   In other violence Wednesday, Alabama police said up to six shots
were fired at a coal-loading operation where union miners were
harassing non-union haulers. One shot struck a coal truck but no
injuries were reported, officers said. Near Matewan, W.Va., six
drivers were injured when roving bands of pickets attacked two
convoys hauling coal to a subsidiary of A.T. Massey Coal Co., the
Herald-Dispatch of Huntington, W.Va., reported. A state police
dispatcher told The Associated Press no one authorized to comment
was available.
   The union said it extended its sanctioned work stoppage to give
Pittston an opportunity to respond to Gov. Gerald Baliles' request
to resume negotiations under federal mediation.
   But the announcement had little impact at a run-down recreation
area dubbed Camp Solidarity in Carterton, a mining town in southwest
Wildcat strikers who have been coming here in shifts of several
hundred from Appalachia and the Midwest who said they have no plans
to end their walkouts.
   ``We're going to continue to show our support until some kind of
settlement is reached,'' said Bill Wall of West Frankfort, Ill.
   In Beckley, W.Va., U.S. District Judge Elizabeth V. Hallanan
granted an injunction requested by the National Labor Relations
Board prohibiting violence and threats by miners that have been on
strike against the New Beckley Mining Corp. since January. Police on
Tuesday escorted replacement workers from a company mine after
strikers reportedly threatened to close it by force.
   State police Sgt. Mike Frank said troopers made 17 arrests in
Carterton. They included a nun who had stopped her medical van in
front of a community center on a highway to deliver medicine, union
officials said.
   Sister Bernadette Kenny, who was wearing a camouflage kerchief,
was charged with impeding traffic and contempt of court. A federal
judge's order forbids the union to impede coal traffic. She was
later released on bond.
   Miss Kenny said that while she supports the union, she never
intended to hinder traffic.
   ``I think it's very ironic that Ollie North is let out of jail to
do community service and I'm arrested for doing community service,''
she said, referring to the former National Security Council aide.

<HEAD>Honda Car Company to Invest in Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co., the Japanese carmaker, will invest
300 million pounds, or $486 million, in a new plant in southwest
England that will create 1,300 new jobs, Industry Secretary Lord
Young said Thursday.
   Honda will extend its engine plant in Swindon, southwest England,
to a full car manufacturing plant capable of producing 100,000 cars
a year, Young told the House of Lords.
   The new plant is part of an arrangement in which Honda will take
a 20-percent stake in Rover Group, the British carmaker with which
it has had joint ventures over the last 10 years. Rover said it will
acquire 20 percent of Honda's manufacturing operation in Swindon.
   Honda and other Japanese carmakers have expressed an interest in
expanding in Europe ahead of 1992 when the 12-nation European
Economic Community becomes a barrier-free market.
   Young said Honda's announcement brings the total investment
commitments in Britain by the three major Japanese car companies to
1.8 billion pounds, or $2.9 billion.
   Young said the new plant is to begin manufacturing at the end of
1991, ``with a limited volume of Honda cars,'' which will substitute
for imports from Japan on the European market.
   ``One year later, a full range of production operations will
start with output rising rapidly to 100,000 cars (per year) in
1994,'' Young said.
   He said this will include cars built for the Rover Group, with
which Honda has had various joint ventures for 10 years. Rover will
continue to build cars for Honda at its plant in Longbridge,
northwest of London.
   Graham Day, chairman of Rover Group, said the deal with Honda
``will help both companies, while preserving their separate
identities, to develop long-term strategies to meet the demands of
an increasingly global market.''
   Rover Group is owned by British Aerospace PLC, which bought the
former state-owned carmaker from the government in July 1988.
   Young called Honda's announcement a ``vote of confidence'' in
Britain and said it signaled a ``renaissance of the U.K. motor
industry.''

<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. is discussing
sweetening its $5.4 billion cash offer for LIN Broadcasting Corp.
shares that it does not already own by including stock that would
boost the offer to $6.2 billion.
   In a joint statement, the companies said they are in continuing
negotiations over a proposal under which each share of LIN stock
would be exchanged for cash and stock having an aggregate value of
$127.50 a share.
   The cash portion of the deal would come to at least $110 a share,
the statement read, with McCaw Class A stock making up the remainder
of the offer.
   McCaw's latest offer for LIN was for $110 a share in cash.
   The companies cautioned in the statement that ``there can be no
assurances that the negotiations will result in an agreement.''
   They said the transaction under discussion would not be completed
before Nov. 1 and would preclude LIN's previously-announced spinoff
of its television stations.
   If the Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw's takeover attempt is
successful, it would result in the largest cellular telephone market
in the country.
   The announcement came a day after McCaw disclosed in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that McCaw and LIN had
``recommenced negotiations through their advisers.''
   Steven Bruce of Abernathy MacGregor, McCaw's outside public
investor relations counsel in New York, said Wednesday's
conversation between McCaw and LIN financial advisers was a
resumption of talks that occurred last weekend.
   McCaw had launched a bid of $120 a share for LIN in June, but LIN
rejected it as inadequate. LIN has about 53.9 million shares on a
fully diluted basis, and McCaw already owns about 5 million, or 9.8
percent, of those shares.
   On Monday, McCaw lowered its bid to $110 per share, citing a New
York court settlement that was unfavorable to LIN.
   The New York Court of Appeals recently denied LIN's claims to
certain cellular interests of Metromedia Co. in the New York City
and Philadelphia markets.
   The new offer reduced the value of its bid for shares it does not
already own to about $5.36 billion, from $5.8 billion.

   The stock market hovered in a narrow range today,

   Wall Streeters were looking ahead to several economic reports due
from the government on Friday, including monthly statistics on
industrial production and the producer price index of finished goods.
   The figures are expected to provide further confirmation that
economic growth is slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of the Federal

   Investors will give especially close scrutiny to the report on
producer prices which, if it lives up to its advance billing, will
show a slackening of inflationary pressures.

<HEAD>Raul Gardini Makes Italian Grain Company Worldwide Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late Serafino Ferruzzi made his fortune helping
to feed starving postwar Italy. His son-in-law, Raul Gardini, has
wider ambitions and they are having repercussions on one of the
world's busiest commodities markets.
   Gardini's company, Ferruzzi Finanziara SpA, was at the center of
attention this week as the reported target of an emergency order by
the Chicago Board of Trade to break up an alleged attempt to corner
the soybean market.
   The company denied it had done anything wrong and protested the
order _ which required liquidation of large positions in the
market's July soybean contract _ saying it was only trying to
satisfy its export commitments.
   Since taking over the Ravenna-based company nine years ago,
Gardini has turned the Ferruzzi food group into Western Europe's
biggest grain exporter and Italy's second largest private-sector
industrial concern after Fiat.
   If Giovanni Agnelli, head of the Fiat auto empire, is Italy's
industrial king, then the handsome, silver-haired Gardini may be the
crown prince.
   But while Agnelli was born into wealth, Italy's financial press
frequently reminds Gardini of his middle-class farming origins and
his rough-and-tumble boardroom style.
   While Agnelli, who holds a law degree, is reverently referred to
as the ``Avvocato'' (lawyer) Gardini has been nicknamed ``Il
Contadino'' (the peasant).
   Gardini has made a number of bold moves since he became head of
the Ferruzzi Group.
   The most important was his 1987 takeover of the Montedison
chemical company, a move that consolidated Ferruzzi's power as
Italy's second-largest private business group.
   Italy's financial press takes pride in describing Gardini as one
of the new breed of enterpreneurs who look beyond Italy's borders
and are not afraid of a corporate fight.
   The 56-year-old Gardini, an avid outdoorsman and hunter who owns
a 500-year-old palace on Venice's Grand Canal, is equally proud of
his roots as a farmer.
   He was born in Ravenna, attended an agricultural school and went
to work for Ferruzzi. In 1957, he married Ferruzzi's daughter, Ida.
   Since becoming chairman in 1980, Gardini launched a major
expansion and the group now owns some 2.5 million acres of land
distributed over three continents.
   Perhaps his boldest move was his raid on Montedison, one of the
10 largest chemical companies in the world but saddled with debt and
aging plants that were accused of being some of Italy's worst
polluters.
   The Italian newsweekly L'Espresso headlined the Montedison
takeover ``the great blitz,'' and published a photograph of Gardini
in his hunting attire, gripping a shotgun with a cigarette dangling
from his mouth.
   Gardini has been accused of riding roughshod over the interests
of minority shareholders. A controversial restructuring of the
Montedison group in 1988 caused a stir among investors, pushing the
Milan Stock Exchange into a tailspin.
   To foreign critics, he said, ``This is an Italian operation in
the Italian market and if investors don't like it they can leave.''
   Among his moves was the ouster of Montedison chairman, Mario
Schimberni, who had encouraged Gardini to buy into Montedison.
Schimberni now heads the Italian state railroad.
   Ferruzzi Finanziara ranked 28th in Fortune 500 magazine's
recently released list of the largest industrial corporations
outside the United States, with 1988 group sales of $18.3 billion.
   Fiat was eighth, with sales of $34 billion.
   Since taking control of Montedison, Ferruzzi has been seeking to
wed the agricultural and chemical industries. The Group recently
announced plans to produce and market a biodegradable plastic made
from corn starch.

   Sales of the Big Three automakers' cars and light
trucks rose 8.9 percent in early July compared with last year when
incentives had been rolled back and sales fell from a torrid June
rate, the companies said Thursday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said they
sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 33,504 during the July
1-10 period this year compared with a rate of 30,766 during the same
time last year.
   Car sales were up 10.3 percent and truck sales were 6.8 percent
higher.
   The sales rate during June last year was particularly strong,
even for what proved to be the second-best sales year in auto
history. But the incentives that spurred those deals began coming
off in early July 1988.
   This year, incentives are available, but they aren't catching as
many consumers' eyes. In fact, GM this week boosted customer and
dealer incentives in an effort to shrink swollen inventories of 1989
cars as the model year enters its last three months.
   While the sales news for the early July period was good, it
brought the automakers' sales so far this year only a little closer
to last year's pace.
   Through July 10 this year, the Big Three had sold 5.9 percent
fewer cars and trucks this year than last year, falling to a daily
rate of 35,308 vehicles from 37,524 last year.
   Car sales were off 7.8 percent for the year and light truck sales
were down 2.6 percent.
   Chrysler was the only one of the Big Three to post a car sales
decline during early July, as sales dropped to a daily rate of 2,921
this year, 5.8 percent lower than the 3,100 daily rate a year ago.
For the calendar year, Chrysler's car sales were down 14.6 percent.
   Chrysler's trucks sold at a rate 1.6 percent higher in early July
this year than they did a year ago. For the year, Chrysler's truck
sales were down 0.7 percent.
   GM posted an 11.3 percent gain in car sales, going to a daily
rate of 10,615 during early July this year compared with a rate of
9,534 during the same time last year. GM's car sales for the year
were down 9 percent from last year's level.
   The company's truck sales ran 13.2 percent ahead of last year's
pace in early July but were down 2.8 percent for the entire year.
   Ford posted the heftiest gain in car sales, rising to a daily
rate of 6,923 during early July this year, up 16.9 percent from the
5,919 car-a-day rate during the same time last year. Ford's car
sales so far this year were running 2.5 percent behind last year's
pace.
   On the truck side, Ford dealers were selling 3.6 percent more
vehicles in early July this year over last year, but 3.8 percent
fewer so far during the year.

<TEXT>
   Consumer products giant Unilever will acquire the
Faberge and Elizabeth Arden lines of toiletries, cosmetics and
fragrances for $1.55 billion, salvaging a deal that had been
abandoned in April, it was announced Thursday.
   A definitive contract between Faberge's owner, Riklis Family
Corp., and Unilever United States Inc., the holding company for
Unilever's American operations, has been signed and the transaction
is expected to be completed within 30 days.
   Unilever and Riklis had reached an agreement in principle on the
takeover back in February and intended to negotiate details of a
final contract within 3 months but the talks broke down.
   In late April, Unilever said it was dropping its plan to acquire
Faberge Inc. and its independent subsidiary Elizabeth Arden because
Meshulam Riklis' Riklis group was demanding changes in the tentative
agreement that would have raised the price.
   In a joint news release Thursday, the companies said their
differences have been resolved. Completion of the transaction is
subject to a number of technical conditions that the companies did
not specify.
   Chris Atkins, a spokesman for Unilever, described the conditions
as minor matters that won't jeopardize the deal.
   ``They are fully confident this deal is going to happen,'' Atkins
said.
   The signed contract resembles the arrangements made in February.
   ``We are delighted that negotiations were resumed and that they
have resulted in a transaction in line with the original terms,''
said Unilever Chairman Michael Angus.
   ``Faberge will be an excellent fit with Unilever's existing
personal products operations and Elizabeth Arden furthers our
ambition to be strongly represented in the important prestige
skin-care, color cosmetics and fragrance sectors,'' he said.
   Under the contract, Unilever is to buy all of Faberge except for
the McGregor Apparel Group, which comprises clothing lines such as
Botany 500, Wonderknit and Bill the Kid.
   Faberge, bought by the Riklis group in 1984 for about $180
million, is a well known manufacturer of personal care products,
including hair sprays, shampoos, deodorants and fragrances. Among
Faberge's brand names are Aqua Net and Brut.
   Elizabeth Arden makes an assortment of premium skin care
products, perfumes and makeups marketed under the names Elizabeth
Arden, Lagerfeld, Fendi and Chloe. New York-based Riklis, whose
other holdings include Samsonite luggage and Culligan water
softeners, acquired Elizabeth Arden from the drug maker Eli Lilly &amp;
Co. for about $700 million in late 1987.
   Combined sales of Faberge and Elizabeth Arden amounted to more
than $800 million in the year ended January 1989 and profit was $93
million.
   Unilever, with dual headquarters in the United Kingdom and the
Netherlands, is among the world's major consumer products companies
and had worldwide sales of $31 billion in 1988. Its products in the
United States range from soaps and laundry detergents to packaged
foods.
   Through acquisitions and internal growth, Unilever for several
years has been building its personal products operations around the
world. It has concentrated its attention on several segments of the
market, among them the prestige end of the fragrance and beauty aid
business.
   Two years ago, Unilever bought Chesebrough-Pond's Inc. for $3.1
billion, thereby acquiring many widely known personal-care products
and several prestige, or expensive, lines such as the Prince
Matchabelli fragrance collection. Unilever also owns Elizabeth
Taylor's Passion scents.
   Just last month, Unilever agreed to acquire the European
cosmetics businesses of U.S. company Schering-Plough Corp. for $120
million.
   Currently, Unilever is in the process of acquiring assets of
Minnetonka Corp. through a tender offer at $22.86 a share, or a
total of $376.2 million.

   Two subsidiaries of an Italian agribusiness giant
today filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block further
implementation of the Chicago Board of Trade's order limiting
soybean futures holdings, a CBOT official said.
   The lawsuit was filed against the exchange in U.S. District Court
in Chicago by Ferruzzi Trading International SA and Ferruzzi USA
Inc., said Ray Carmichael, CBOT spokesman.
   He said the exchange would ``vigorously'' fight the lawsuit.
   The parent of the two firms, Ferruzzi SpA, has denied it
attempted to corner the soybean market, charging instead that a
CBOT's order calling for liquidation of large positions in the
exchange's July contract ``undermines the reliability'' of such
contracts.
   Soybean futures rebounded moderately in early trading today.
Analysts said the buying was a reaction to a government report
released late Wednesday that indicated spring soybean plantings were
below expectations.
   Exchange spokesman Raymond Carmichael said the Board of Trade
order was issued late Tuesday to correct a wide disparity between
the number of contracts outstanding and the actual supply of
soybeans available.
   In a statement released Wednesday in Milan, Italy, Ferruzi said
its ``accumulation of beans was undertaken so that the group could
assure the uninterrupted operation of its processing plants ... and
to satisfy export commitments, particularly to the Soviet Union.''
   ``All actions taken by the group were within accepted practices,
and the emergency order ... was taken in disregard to the true
economics of the marketplace,'' the company said.
   Ferruzzi, Western Europe's leading grain trader, said it had been
accumulating soybeans openly in compliance with CBOT rules because
last year's drought could have caused a shortage, but it did not say
how much it had bought.
   The statement also said the BOT action would ``undermine the
reliability of the contracts'' of the Board of Trade.
   In Minnesota, the state agriculture commissioner on Wednesday
asked the FBI to investigate whether any Board of Trade officials
benefited from the emergency order.
   Commissioner Jim Nichols said a drop in soybean prices would
benefit those holding ``short'' positions, or obligations to sell
soybeans.
   ``It is possible that some of the members of the board of
directors who made this order held short positions and benefited
greatly from this order,'' Nichols said in a letter to FBI director
William Sessions.
   Soybeans are used for products ranging from tofu and cooking oil
to cosmetics and animal feed.
   Activity in the BOT soybean pit, the world's largest for that
commodity, was heaviest at the beginning and end of the session
Wednesday as traders tried to sort rumors from facts.
   A BOT soybean trader said the late sale Wednesday of 3 million to
4 million bushels by a large brokerage near the close of trading
helped soybeans close 39{ cents down on the day at $6.86{ a bushel.
   The trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that sale
had all the earmarks of a foreign firm moving to comply with the
BOT's emergency liquidation order.
   One of the reasons for the midday trading lull, according to
several traders, was a report that a Ferruzzi subsidiary in Belle
Chasse, La., planned to ask a federal court for a restraining order
against the BOT action.
   Spokesman Edward Barron of the Ferruzzi subsidiary declined to
comment on the report.
   Ferruzzi's holdings in Louisiana include American Bank and Trust
of New Orleans, a grain elevator and land.
   BOT spokesman Raymond Carmichael said the exchange's board of
directors issued the order to liquidate large soybean positions to
correct a wide disparity between the number of contracts being held
for deliverable supplies of the product and the actual supply of
soybeans available.
   Carmichael refused to comment on whether the BOT's effort was
designed to break up any firm's attempt to corner the market.
   A number of traders and analysts compared the soybean market
situation to an alleged effort by the Hunt brothers of Texas a
decade ago to corner the world silver market. But others doubted
such extensive manipulation of the soybean market had taken place.
   The exchange ordered all traders holding commitments to buy or
sell more than 3 million bushels of soybeans for delivery this month
to reduce those positions by at least 20 percent each trading day
through July 20, when the July contract expires.
   The emergency resolution said no trader may control more than 3
million bushels of July soybeans at the close of trading Tuesday,
and no trader may control more than 1 million bushels by the
contract's expiration two days later.
   Futures are binding contracts to buy or sell a set amount of a
commodity at an agreed-upon price at a later date. A typical corner
occurs when a trader holding a large number of buy contracts also
owns so much of the commodity that sellers cannot acquire enough to
honor their delivery commitments.
   The artificial supply squeeze causes the commodity's price to
soar until the trader working the corner sells out at a huge profit.
   The Sun-Times also quoted unidentified sources saying the BOT
action stemmed in part from complaints by Archer Daniels Midland
Co., the Decatur, Ill.-based agribusiness giant.
   ADM spokesman Dick Burket said the company had no comment
Wednesday.
   A trading source who insisted on anonymity told The Associated
Press that the situation began as a battle between ADM and Ferruzzi
for export business.
   ``Ferruzzi was smart enough to cover itself by getting supplies
from the cash market and the futures market,'' he said. ``ADM relied
almost entirely on the futures market. When supplies got tight, ADM
had to go to the cash market to satisfy export demands and the
tighter the supply, the higher the premium they paid.''
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the
futures industry, said Wednesday in Washington that it had been
monitoring the soybean market for several months. But it would not
comment on whether an investigation was under way into any attempt
to corner the soybean market.

<HEAD>Isoceles Claims Control of Gateway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Isosceles PLC on Thursday claimed victory in its
nearly 3-month-old battle for Gateway Corp. PLC, saying it had more
than 50 percent of the British food store group's shares under its
control.
   A rival bidding group that includes the U.S. investment firm
Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co. said it wouldn't give up its interest in
Gateway. It said it would hold on to its stake of nearly 34 percent
in Gateway and that it would be an active shareholder.
   Isosceles, a group of disgruntled Gateway shareholders, said it
had received acceptances for its 2.1 billion-pound, the equivalent
of about $3.4 billion, bid from shareholders owning 120.7 million
ordinary shares, or 13.5 percent of the total. Isosceles already
owned 37.4 percent of Gateway shares.
   The announcement claiming control came minutes after the rival
bidders said they had bought an additional 20.3 million Gateway
shares in the market Wednesday to lift their holdings to 33.79
percent.
   A spokesman for Newgateway PLC, the takeover vehicle of
Wasserstein, Perella and its partner, Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea
Co., said: ``There's no drama'' in Isosceles crossing the 50-percent
threshold first.
   Isosceles' gaining a majority stake in Gateway stock ``was always
a possibility'' that was considered at the time Newgateway made its
``final offer,'' said the spokesman, who wasn't identified, in
accordance with British custom.
   Isosceles began its hostile takeover attempt in April, offering
210 pence, or about $3.42, a share. Later, it increased its offer to
230 pence, or $3.75, a share after Newgateway entered the bidding.
Newgateway's offer stands at 242 pence, or $3.94, a share.
   Alec Monk, Gateway,'s chairman, said the situation was ``still a
stalemate,'' and that Isosceles would need around 75 percent of
Gateway to ``consolidate'' the company.
   ``And they can't possibly achieve that because Newgateway
controls nearly 34 percent,'' Monk added.
   Isosceles plans to break up Gateway, to help repay its debt, by
selling 62 major superstores to Asda Group PLC for around 703
million pounds, or about $1.15 billion. Although Newgateway's bid is
also highly leveraged, the group has pledged to sell only a limited
number of less profitable stores.
   Isosceles can press ahead with its reorganization plans with just
over 50 percent control, but analysts predict it will run into
fierce resistance from Newgateway.
   Newgateway said it ``looks forward to its role as a major
long-term shareholder in Gateway.''
   ``We regard this as an important investment in a major British
food retailer,'' the group said. ``We intend to be an active
shareholder.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Surge On Ferruzzi Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade following news of a lawsuit
seeking to block the exchange's order that traders reduce their
holdings in the July soybean contract.
   Wheat and oat futures also advanced while corn futures finished
mixed.
   Two subsidiaries of Italian agribusiness giant Ferruzzi SpA filed
a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Chicago seeking an injunction
against the Board of Trade's emergency directive.
   The exchange's order, issued Tuesday, is widely seen as an
attempt to block an attempt by Ferruzzi to control the soybean
market.
   Soybeans had opened strongly higher, but the market had eased by
midday on profit-taking. Wire service reports of Ferruzzi's lawsuit
appeared at about 1 p.m. CDT.
   ``From the time it showed on the wire, we had a pretty decent
recovery in here,'' said Dale Gustafson, grain market analyst with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.90{ a bushel; corn was 6\ cents
lower to } cent higher with July at $2.56{ a bushel; oats were 3
cents to 4{ cents higher with July at $1.48\ a bushel; soybeans were
9} cents to 18{ cents higher with July up 10{ cents at $6.97 a
bushel.

   Stock prices gained more ground today, extending
the advance that carried the market to new post-crash highs on
Wednesday..
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 92.57 points over the
past seven sessions, rose another 12.70 to 2,545.33 by 3 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 733 up, 696 down and 519
unchanged.
   Analysts said some traders had grown leery of chasing after
stocks following the market's latest rally, which produced gains in
each of the first seven trading days in July.
   But Wall Streeters were looking ahead optimistically to several
economic reports due from the government on Friday, including
monthly statistics on industrial production and the producer price
index of finished goods.
   The figures are expected to provide further confirmation that
economic growth is slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   Investors will give especially close scrutiny to the report on
producer prices which, if it lives up to its advance billing, will
show a slackening of inflationary pressures.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Eastman Kodak, up 1{ at
48~; International Business Machines, up ] at 115[; Union carbide,
up ~ at 28, and General Motors, up { at 42[.
   Sun Electric tumbled 6\ to 18]. The company, which had been
soliciting takeover bids, said it had attracted no suitable offers
and expects to remain independent.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.25 to 184.40. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<HEAD>Mack Tells UAW It Will Not Appeal Union Vote Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mack Trucks Inc. has notified the United
Auto Workers that it will not appeal the results of a union election
held at its new plant in Winnsboro, S.C., the company said Thursday.
   By doing so, the company said it would recognize the UAW and
proceed to negotiations for a contract. Mack said the new policy was
in the best interest of the company and its customers.
   Mack is one of North America's largest producers of heavy-duty
deisel trucks. Mack vehicles are sold and serviced in more than 65
countries around the world.
   Shortly after the union election in April, Mack officials said
the Allentown-based company would block certification of the results
and refuse to recognize the UAW in South Carolina.
   Some workers in South Carolina said Mack reversed its policy
because of Ralph E. Reins, the company's new president.
   Reins, former president of ITT Automotive of Highland Park,
Mich., was named Mack's president on June 13. In a surprise visit to
the 23-month-old plant in Winnsboro last week, he spoke with many of
the 850 workers.
   ``I talked to him at the plant,'' said Rudy Feagin, a worker who
heads the plant's Unity Committee for South Carolinians backing the
UAW. ``He told me and many other people that he thought this
situation had to be resolved.
   ``He was determined to squash the appeals and give us a contract.
He said we deserved one.''
   Reins then urged Mack's board of directors to change tactics with
the UAW, the union said. The board, chaired by chief executive
officer John B. Curcio, agreed.
   Workers in Mack's plants in Maryland and Pennsylvania earn up to
$15 per hour. If Winnsboro workers are elevated to that level from
their current $10 per hour, Mack will be handed an annual wage
increase of more than $8 million.

   Japanese businessmen and trade officials see
dismal prospects for investment in China in the coming year, and
dispute suggestions Japan may profit from China's current political
maladies.
   Fears that Japan will take advantage of the flight of other
foreign businesses to tighten its grip on the China market are
unfounded, said one Japanese trade office manager.
   ``It's a big misunderstanding'' said the official, who like other
Japanese interviewed spoke on condition he not be identified.
   He said that since the June 3-4 military assault on pro-democracy
protesters in Beijing, not one trade delegation from Japan has
passed through his office.
   After the attack, there was a mass exodus of foreigners,
including the Japanese. Japan warned its businessmen against a quick
return, saying it would give the impression of a ``thief at a fire''
_ someone profiting from another's misfortune.
   About half the 1,000 Japanese based in Beijing have returned and
more are expected back in the coming week. Most however, have come
mainly to settle accounts or fulfill existing contracts, one of them
said.
   A few companies may eventually reduce their staff here, he said.
``No one will increase'' their Japanese employees.
   Matsushita Electric spokesman Naomi Haga said in Tokyo that an
official opening planned for late July for a joint venture that has
begun producing color TV sets was now ``impossible.''
   ``Beijing is under martial law, and the Japanese government urged
Japanese to leave the country,'' he said. ``We can't give the
project up.... It would violate the contract. But it's dangerous to
be there now, and we don't have enough Japanese at the site to keep
it on schedule.''
   Japan's Prime Minister Sousuke Uno has said economic sanctions
won't be imposed on China, but Tokyo has stopped high-level contacts
and put off discussions on $5.8 billion in official development
loans Japan is to provide China for the 1990-95 period.
   More important, said an embassy official in Beijing, Japanese
companies won't be investing in China in the near future because of
an erosion of trust in the Beijing government.
   ``Even if martial law is lifted, the government has already lost
too much credibility,'' he said.
   He said Chinese companies will have increasing difficulties
borrowing money on the world market. One Japanese securities firm
has put off lending $100 million to southern China's Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp.
   The embassy official said Japanese companies, much criticized by
China for their reluctance to invest in projects, had finally
decided the time was right after former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita signed an investment protection agreement in Beijing in
August. Since then, more than $100 million in investment had been
pledged.
   But China's recent crackdown on political dissent, and fears the
arbitrary use of force could some day be applied to the foreign
business community, ``have thrown cold water'' on future investment
plans, he said.
   So far, no one is talking about leaving. ``It's too early for
such a decision,'' said Kazuhiro Takeda of the Japan-China
Association of Economics and Trade in Tokyo. ``Most companies are
watching the conditions, seeing what direction the Chinese
government takes.''
   Those already in China won't give up, he said, but for at least a
year there will be few newcomers, he said.
   Short-term prospects also were poor for trade between China and
its biggest trading partner outside Hong Kong.
   Last year trade volume reached a nearly balanced $19.3 billion,
and expectations were it would top $20 billion this year. In the
first five months of 1989, trade was up 15 percent to $8.2 billion.
   But the political chaos, coming on top of a faltering economy,
has put many Chinese companies in a serious economic pinch. Japanese
steelmakers temporarily suspended shipments to China because they
couldn't get letters of credit from Chinese banks. Chinese companies
can't get funds for raw materials because of the government's tough
austerity policies that have dried up credit.
   The diplomat said China can finally produce the quality light
industrial goods and silk that Japan demands, but now can't deliver
the goods because of transportation, supply and energy problems.
   He said Japan's trade surplus is likely to grow again, although
China may move to cut back imports as its exports tail off.
   He said Japan has exhausted most of its investment possibilities
in Thailand and other Asian countries, and Japanese companies
looking for ways to spend their money still consider China the top
candidate in the long run.
   But every Japanese interviewed stressed that ``caution'' will be
the guiding principle. ``The Chinese say there will be no change in
their open-door policy but at the same time they are criticizing
capitalism,'' the trade official said. ``For the time being, we'll
have to wait and watch.''

<TEXT>
   When Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co. meatpackers were
threatening to strike nearly four years ago, two reporters bet on
how long the strike would last.
   Paul Klauda said more than 10 days. Dave Hage said one day or
less, thinking the strike would never happen.
   ``I thought they would realize before they came to the brink that
the strike would be a failure and that they wouldn't strike,'' Hage
said.
   He was wrong.
   The bitter strike in Austin, Minn., lasted for months and
provided Hage and Klauda, both reporters for the Star Tribune in
Minneapolis, with enough drama to fill a nearly 400-page book.
   ``No Retreat, No Surrender: Labor's War at Hormel,'' published in
June by William Morrow &amp; Co. Inc., is one of several books about the
strike due on the market this year.
   ``There were so many strands that went beyond just a normal
labor-management fight. It wasn't just another strike,'' said
Klauda, who teamed with Hage to follow the battle for the Star
Tribune.
   The walkout's intriguing ingredients included the presence of a
Fortune 500 company in a small southern Minnesota town; the
half-century of labor peace Hormel had enjoyed; the benign history
of the Austin union, which struck for three days in 1933; and the
local's hiring of flamboyant union consultant Ray Rogers, known for
organizing J.P. Stevens textile mills in the South and, more
recently, helping Eastern Airlines strikers in their battle with
management.
   ``You just stumbled across one great story after another,'' said
Hage. ``And there just wasn't time to go back and revisit those
people to explore a certain accusation or to get to know a certain
person better, because tomorrow or Sunday there's always another
news story to write.''
   For a time, the strike was one of the nation's top labor stories.
While other plants in the Hormel chain agreed to wage concessions,
workers in Austin decided to fight a proposed wage cut. More than
1,400 union members walked off their jobs on Aug. 17, 1985.
   Local P-9 of the United Food and Commercial Workers objected to a
profitable company imposing a wage cut; Hormel said the cut was
needed for the company to stay competitive.
   Since the strike ended, the maker of Spam luncheon meat, Cure 81
ham and Black Label bacon has reported two consecutive years of
record earnings, continuing a five-year stretch of increasing
profits.
   Hage and Klauda said the strike symbolized worker anxiety about
concessions in the 1980s. But they concluded it failed to turn the
tide, partly because events in a town of 23,000 weren't going to
reverse nationwide economic forces.
   ``You're not going to overturn the high unemployment rate,'' Hage
said. ``You're not going to overturn all these trends in the
meatpacking industry that involve non-union competitors and falling
red-meat consumption.''
   In their book, Hage and Klauda trace the roots of the strike, the
first against Hormel since the Austin walkout 52 years before. The
reporters found it ironic that Hormel, with a history of good labor
relations and innovations such as profit-sharing dating to the
1930s, was the target of such bitterness.
   They also were fascinated by Jim Guyette, the young P-9 president
elected on a no-concessions platform. Guyette and other local
officers were suspended by the UFCW international union, which took
control of P-9 for refusing to end the strike and negotiated a
settlement ratified in September 1986. The trusteeship has since
been lifted and new local officers elected.
   In Klauda's view, the uncompromising Guyette was driven ``the
same way someone would be driven to go serve in a Third World
country, (in) some kind of humanitarian way.''
   Guyette now works for a hospital and health-care workers union in
Michigan. ``I was after a fair and decent contract that people could
work under,'' said in an interview. ``A safe place to work. A place
where you didn't have to raise your hand to go to the bathroom.
That's all I was after.''
   Five months after the strike began, Hormel reopened the plant and
began hiring replacement workers. The company was flooded by
applicants and former strikers who crossed the picket line. Gov.
Rudy Perpich called out the National Guard to maintain order at the
plant.
   One of those hired as a replacement worker was Michael T. Fahey,
whose book on the strike, ``Packing It In! The Hormel Strike
1985-86,'' was published in April by Kirwin &amp; Sons Publishing Inc.
of St. Paul.
   Fahey concludes Hormel was the wrong target for a meatpackers
strike and that Guyette was on an ``ego trip.''
   ``Jim Guyette had a very strong ego, and he ran into another ego
just as strong: Dick Knowlton (Hormel's president, board chairman
and chief executive officer),'' Fahey said. ``Thing was, Knowlton
had more horses.''
   Another book, ``On Strike at Hormel,'' takes a pro-strike side
and offers an insider's account, according to its author, Hardy
Green. The book will be published this fall by Temple University
Press of Philadelphia.
   Green worked for Rogers' New York-based Corporate Campaign and
was in Austin for much of the strike. He disputes claims that
Guyette was on a ``power trip.''
   ``Anyone who was in Austin could see this was not the strike of
one person,'' he said. ``It could never be the strike of one person
leading a bunch of zombies, because these people went all over the
country.''
   Three years since the strike ended, there are signs that wounds
are healing in Austin. Hormel has notified 35 of 442 former strikers
on a preferential hiring list that they will be called back to work
by July 24. The company also held an employee appreciation picnic in
Austin that attracted more than 5,000.
   But some scars remain. ``You almost wonder whether some day
grandkids are going to look back and say, `Which side were you
on?''' Hage said.

<HEAD>Chemical, Bank of New York Report 2nd Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical Banking Corp. on Thursday reported
static earnings for the second quarter while profits at the Bank of
New York more than doubled as the result of its acquisition of
Irving Bank Corp. late last year.
   At Chemical, income gains were offset by higher expenses and a
slump in bond trading profits.
   For the quarter ended June 30, Chemical reported net income of
$128.6 million, up 0.7 percent from $127.7 million in the year-ago
period.
   Earnings per share fell 16.7 percent from $1.98 a year ago to
$1.65 in the second quarter because of an increase in the number of
common shares outstanding. Chemical issued 7 million shares in
December.
   Net interest income totaled $565 million, down 5 percent from
$595.1 million. Chemical attributed the decrease to $4.4 billion
lower average earning assets resulting from the divestiture of
certain businesses and assets.
   Non-interest income, including fees for trust and other banking
services, totaled $252.2 million, up 12.6 percent from $223.9
million a year ago.
   Provision for loan losses totaled $90.9 million, which includes
$45 million loaned to countries that are rescheduling their debt. A
year ago, Chemical's loan-loss provision amounted to $95.8 million.
   Chemical said profits from foreign exchange trading totaled a
record $51.5 million during the quarter, but trading account
activities lost $1.8 million, compared with a $25.7 million profit a
year ago.
   For the first six months, Chemical said net income totaled $246.5
million, down 3 percent from $253.2 million in the first half of
1988. Earnings per share totaled $3.14, down from $3.93.
   Net interest income totaled $1.16 billion for the first two
quarters, down from $1.17 billion a year ago. Non-interest income
rose 14.4 percent to $497.8 million from $435 million a year ago.
   Total assets amounted to $75.9 billion at the end of the second
quarter, compared with $75.8 billion a year ago.
   At the Bank of New York, net income for the second quarter
totaled $114.3 million, up 130 percent from $49.7 million a year
ago. The jump reflects the November 1988 acquisition of Irving Bank.
   Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis amounted to $1.55, up
from $1.30 a year ago.
   Chairman J. Carter Bacot noted in a statement that the bank
experienced strong growth in all major commercial lending areas
during the second quarter. He also noted that ``cost savings arising
from the merger are being realized sooner than anticipated.''
   Net interest income totaled $327.5 million, up 84 percent from
$177.8 million a year ago. Non-interest income, bolstered by loan
syndication fees and credit card fees totaled $230.8 million,
compared with $119.4 a year ago.
   Allowances for loan losses totaled $919.3 million at the end of
the second quarter, compared with $31.9 million a year ago. The bank
reported a $30.6 million charge-off related to its non-performing
Argentine debt.
   For the first six months, net income totaled $215.4 million, or
$2.92 a share, up 107 percent from $104.1 million, or $2.77 a share
a year ago.
   Net interest earnings totaled $653.2 million, up from $360.7
million in the first six months of 1988. Non-interest income totaled
$469.9 million, up from $233.9 million a year ago.
   Total assets at the end of the quarter amounted to $49.59
billion, up 109 percent from $23.62 billion a year ago.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC abandoned a $400 million note
issue Thursday because of what it called market disruption caused by
a hostile $21 billion takeover bid from an investor group led by Sir
James Goldsmith.
   The issue, set for completion Monday, would have been one of the
biggest Eurobond offerings ever by a non-U.S. company.
   The London-based conglomerate said it also withdrew the issue to
protect its investors against substantial losses that could result
from ``the hostile and highly leveraged nature of the bid.''
   The group, which also includes British merchant banker Jacob
Rothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer, is offering the
equivalent of $13.86 a share in debt securities to acquire BAT, a
tactic that underscores the growing dominance of the American style
on the worldwide takeover scene.
   American-sized, it is four times bigger than the previous biggest
British bid and rivals the record $25 billion buyout earlier this
year of U.S. food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Corp.
   Instead of cash, the group's offer uses junk bonds, an American
financing technique not readily accepted on this side of the
Atlantic.
   Both sides also have lined up leading American investment bankers
as soldiers, and many of the battles are expected to take place
before American courts and U.S. insurance regulators.
   BAT has wide-ranging interests in the United States, including
Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp., Farmers Insurance Group Inc. and
the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's department stores.
   Forty-one percent of BAT's pre-tax profit and 30 percent of its
revenue came from North America last year.
   BAT immediately rejected the offer from the Goldsmith group after
it was launched Tuesday through a newly formed company called
Hoylake Investments PLC.
   BAT's shares on London's Stock Exchange continued retreating
toward the offering price, finishing down the equivalent of 24 cents
at $14.05 Thursday.
   Junk bonds, such as those the Goldsmith group is offering in its
cashless bid, are not as widely used or accepted in Britain, where
high-debt ventures are less common than in the United States.
   Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk debt securities commonly
used to finance takeovers and corporate expansions in the United
States. Their name comes from their low credit rating, which means
they have a greater risk of default than higher-rated bonds.
   Also new to the relatively staid British takeover scene is the
break-up of such a large company. Goldsmith said he wanted to
``unbundle'' BAT by selling off its non-tobacco interests, which he
claims have depressed the company's stock price.
   In the BAT war, the offense has lined up junk bond pioneers
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Bankers Trust Co. among its
financing pros. Its legal advisers include Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom, a prominent U.S. takeover law firm.
   The defense quickly enlisted Goldman Sachs and Co. and Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. to help Lazard Brothers and Co. plot its strategy.
   Aggressive American investment firms have been leaders in
developing sophisticated takeover and anti-takeover techniques honed
during the U.S. merger mania of the 1980s.
   In addition, ``With all the big buyout funds in the United
States, and most of the big buyout funds being led by Americans,
that (lining up American firms) would be both a defensive and an
aggressive move,'' said Clive Sherling, a director of the buyout
firm Alan Patricof Associates Ltd. in London.
   BAT's defense might be a management buyout, which could be
financed partly with funds from U.S. investors, Sherling said.
   ``I'm sure that it would be led from the States and therefore by
having American advisers they would have a more direct line to the
cash,'' Sherling said.
   He also noted the Goldsmith group had enlisted high-powered U.S.
takeover firms for the same reason BAT has.
   ``If you're sitting there as an aggressor trying to figure out
what the defensive strategy would be, you would figure they would
use American advisers and you would try to cut them off at the pass
and get the best ones,'' Sherling said.

<HEAD>Actor Settles Suit Over Spokesman Job</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Kirk Douglas settled his lawsuit Thursday
against Sperry Corp., which dropped him as spokesman two years ago
when it merged with Burroughs Corp. to form Unisys Corp.
   The settlement, for an undisclosed amount, occurred just as jury
selection was to begin in federal court in Manhattan.
   ``I've never been in a courtroom before except in a movie _ and
then I always knew my lines,'' Douglas said after the settlement.
   Douglas had filed a breach of contract suit two years ago against
Sperry and Unisys, claiming termination of the contract wrecked his
chances of getting a ``similarly prestigious and rewarding contract
with any other major U.S. corporation.''
   The $17.8 million suit was later amended to $1.25 million.
   Terms of the settlement weren't revealed, but Douglas said,
``Everyone is satisfied, I'm happy. ... I'm pleased it was amicably
settled.''
   Douglas was Sperry's corporate spokesman from October 1985 until
it was acquired by Burroughs on Sept. 16, 1986. The company told
Douglas in a letter that it was assuming ``a new company name and
corporate identity,'' and refused to take on Douglas' contract.
   Douglas, star of ``Spartacus,'' ``Lust for Life'' and more than
70 other films, had claimed that the contract was supposed to
continue if the Sperry product line or corporate identity survived a
merger. The suit cited the continued marketing of some products with
the Sperry logo.
   Unisys maintained that a clause in Douglas' contract said that in
the event of a merger, the contract would not continue unless both
parties agreed, said Peter Hynes, spokesman for the Blue Bell,
Pa.-based information systems company.
   ``I am grateful to go back to the world of make believe,'' said
Douglas, who was accompanied in court by his wife, Anne.
   Douglas made personal appearances, television commercials and
said he interrupted filming of ``Tough Guys'' with Burt Lancaster to
make a promotional film for Sperry. He said he hasn't worked for any
other companies as a spokesman, but would consider doing it again.

   Oil futures prices closed slightly higher
Thursday in choppy, light trading, recouping some of the losses of
the previous session.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for West
Texas Intermediate, which dropped 38 cents on Wednesday, rose 20
cents to settle at $20.35 per 42-gallon barrel. Other contract
months of the benchmark U.S. grade of crude posted even stronger
gains.
   Refined petroleum products traded on the exchange also rose.
   The August contract for home heating oil was up 0.50 cent to
settle at 49.44 cents a gallon after sliding 0.34 cent on Wednesday.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for August delivery was up 0.05 cent
to settle at 57.46 cents a gallon. The gain added to Wednesday's
increase of 0.79 cent a gallon.
   Richard Redoglia, vice president at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures,
noted that the market came back after Wednesday's technical selloff
on fears that maintenance and platform workers on North Sea rigs
might go on strike.
   ``The reports of a further work slowdown ... seemed to hold the
market,'' he said, noting that the impact was felt particularly
among crude prices.
   On the whole, however, Redoglia characterized trading as
``relatively choppy on very light volume. The market had no momentum
and no direction.''

   Stock prices pushed ahead today, extending the
advance that carried the market to new post-crash highs on Wednesday.
   Analysts said some traders had grown leery of chasing after
stocks following the market's latest rally, which produced gains in
each of the first seven trading days in July.
   But Wall Streeters were looking ahead optimistically to several
economic reports due from the government on Friday, including
monthly statistics on industrial production and the producer price
index of finished goods.
   The figures are expected to provide further confirmation that
economic growth is slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   Investors will give especially close scrutiny to the report on
producer prices which, if it lives up to its advance billing, will
show a slackening of inflationary pressures.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Reports Higher Net, Revenue For Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Thursday that
net income for the second quarter rose 6 percent as nearly each of
its main business units posted gains in operating profits.
   For the quarter ended June 30, Westinghouse reported net income
of $228.3 million, or $1.56 per share, up from $215.3 million, or
$1.47 a share in the year-ago period.
   Net income for the 1988 period was restated to reflect a lower
tax provision. Compared to previously reported results,
second-quarter net income was up 13 percent.
   Revenue during the period rose 4.5 percent to $3.18 billion from
$3.04 billion a year ago.
   Westinghouse Chairman John C. Marous said in a statement,
``Orders entered for continuing businesses in the first half are up
almost 10 percent over last year, and our backlog of $11.5 billion
is a record for the decade.''
   He also noted that ``order rates for both electronic systems and
power generation were very strong. In fact, power generation is
having its best order year since the mid 1970s.''
   Operating profits from the energy and utility systems segment and
the industrial segment rose, while operating profits from the
broadcasting unit were even for the quarter but up for the year's
first half.
   Revenues from the financial services unit rose because of higher
levels of outstanding loans and marketable securities, but operating
profit for the quarter was static compared to the 1988 period.
   Operating profit from the electronic systems unit was up, while
operating profit from the commercial group was even despite a sharp
decline in the company's beverage business.
   For the year's first half, profits increased 5.4 percent to
$417.3 million, or $2.86 per share, from a restated $395.8 million,
or $2.72 per share. Revenue for the six-month period rose 4.7
percent to $6.06 billion from $5.79 billion.

   The dollar moved mostly higher against major
foreign currencies Thursday in choppy trading ahead of potentially
market-moving economic reports due Friday.
   Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery fell $1.70 to $377.00 a troy ounce.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $375.50 for an
ounce of gold bullion at 4 p.m. EDT, down from Wednesday's late bid
of $377.40.
   Activity in the foreign exchange markets featured dealers
adjusting their holdings in anticipation of government reports to be
released Friday on U.S. wholesale price inflation, retail sales and
industrial production.
   ``I think people feel the statistics will be pointing to a weaker
economy and hence a weaker dollar,'' said Bob Morrissey, a trader in
the Bank of Boston's New York office.
   Despite this perception, the dollar finished higher against most
currencies except the Japanese yen. The dollar's strength was a
byproduct of dealers' desires to lighten their holdings of West
German marks, mainly so they could buy more yen.
   Trading probably was slightly lighter than normal due to some
reluctance to establish significant new positions before the annual
economic summit of the Group of Seven major industrial countries,
which gets under way Friday in Paris.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed lower at 139.05 Japanese yen, down
from 140.50 late Wednesday. In London late Thursday, the dollar
traded higher at 139.20, and in New York, the dollar ended at 139.45
yen, down from 139.60 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound closed at $1.6240, cheaper for
buyers than Wednesday's late level of $1.6255. Sterling fetched
$1.6205 in New York, compared to $1.6300 on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.8885 West German marks, up from 1.8745;
1.6240 Swiss francs, up from 1.6135; 1.19295 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.18955; 6.4085 French francs, up from 6.3575; and, 1,369.50
Italian lire, up from 1,359.00.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with levels late
Wednesday were: 1.8815 West German marks, up from 1.8755; 1.6190
Swiss francs, up from 1.6135; 6.3870 French francs, up from 6.3645;
2.1155 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1160; 1,362.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,361.50; and, 1.1922 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18965.
   Bullion dealers said there was little interest in gold ahead of
Friday's U.S. economic statistics. They said if the news indicated
slower economic growth, that could push the dollar lower and gold
could head upward.
   Gold closed in both London and Zurich at a bid of $375.75 a troy
ounce, down from Thursday's levels of $379.75 in London and $379.50
in Zurich.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $377.45 bid, down from
$380.05.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.20 bid a troy ounce,
down from $5.27. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery closed at $5.195 a troy ounce, up from Wednesday's
settlement of $5.188.

<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual
funds increased by $4.39 billion in the latest week to a new record
of $328.15 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday broke the record
set the previous week, when the fund assets rose by a revised $2.96
billion to total $323.76 billion, the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group said. That weekly rise originally was reported as $2.83
billion.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 231 general
purpose funds fell $196.4 million to $104.85 billion, assets of 95
broker-dealer funds increased $2.59 billion to $139.19 billion, and
assets of 142 institutional funds rose $1.99 billion to $84.11
billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.75 percent from 8.85 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.84 percent from 8.91 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 40
days, up from 38 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts fell to 6.54 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.55 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was 5.14 percent, unchanged from the previous week.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.62
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.79 the
previous week. Yields were 8.63 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.83 percent; 8.50 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.66 percent;
and 8.45 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.63 percent.

   Stock prices posted their eight straight gain
Thursday as traders waited hopefully for new signs of a slowing
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which closed Wednesday
at a new high since the 1987 crash, rose another 5.69 to 2,538.32.
   That extended the average's gain so far this month to 98.26
points, leaving it about 184 points shy of the record closing high
of 2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
798 up, 671 down and 526 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 153.80 million
shares, down from 160.55 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 183.97 million shares.
   Analysts said traders were looking ahead optimistically to
several economic reports due from the government on Friday,
including monthly statistics on industrial production and the
producer price index of finished goods.
   The figures are expected to provide further confirmation that
economic growth is slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   Investors were likely to give especially close scrutiny to the
report on producer prices which, if it lives up to its advance
billing, will show a slackening of inflationary pressures.
   Estimates on Wall Street call for the index to be up about 0.3
percent for June, compared to a 0.9 percent jump the month before.
   As had happened on Wednesday, the market encountered some mild
selling in the first half of the session, but then resumed its
advance in afternoon trading.
   Honeywell, widely discussed of late as a possible takeover
candidate, jumped 6{ to 86.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Eastman Kodak, up 1]
at 48}; Walt Disney, up ~ at 99}; Union Carbide, up } at 27~, and
General Motors, up ] at 42. GM shares got a boost from
better-than-expected domestic car sales for early July.
   Westinghouse Electric rose 1 to 65\. The company reported
second-quarter earnings of $1.56 a share, up from $1.47 a share in
the comparable period last year.
   Shaw Industries picked up 1 to 16}, also on higher quarterly
profits.
   Sun Electric tumbled 6 to 18|. The company, which had been
soliciting takeover bids, said it had attracted no suitable offers
and expects to remain independent.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $4.31 billion, or 0.13
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .16 to 184.31.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .26 to 376.50, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .14 at 329.95.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
1.08 to 447.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 367.64, up .46.

   Early-July sales of North American-made cars and
light trucks jumped 8.9 percent over the same period last year, the
companies reported Thursday.
   The eight major U.S.-based automakers reported they sold vehicles
at an average rate of 35,614 a day during the July 1-10 period this
year compared with a rate of 32,696 during the same time last year.
   Car sales were up 9.3 percent and truck sales rose 8.3 percent.
   ``It's got to be surprising that they were up that much,'' said
analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
of New York.
   But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said he had
expected sales to be a bit stronger because General Motors had been
advertising in incentive programs to take delivery by July 10.
   ``Early-July sales were inflated by that artificial July 10
deadline,'' he said, adding he expected slower mid-July sales.
   General Motors Corp.'s early-July car sales were up 11.3 percent
and Ford Motor Co.'s car sales rose 16.9 percent. Car sales by
Chrysler Corp. fell 5.8 percent.
   Chrysler is plagued with product availability problems, Heaney
and Healy said. The company is getting production and marketing for
its Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim in line as it phases out its
K-cars, the Reliant and Aries.
   ``It's a phasing out and a phasing in and that's combined with an
overall weak market,'' Heaney said.
   The industry's early-July increases are compared with a period
last year that worked out to be just about on trend for the entire
year, the second-best in the industry's history.
   But for 1989 as a whole, sales this year are lagging behind last
year's pace.
   The eight companies reported their combined car and light truck
sales ran 4.4 percent behind last year's pace through July 10. So
far this yea, the automakers have sold vehicles at a daily rate of
38,100 compared with a rate of 39,835 a day last year.
   Car sales were down 5.6 percent and truck sales were off 2.1
percent.
   One of the surprises in the early-July sales figures was a 31.8
percent drop in sales of U.S.-made Hondas. Demand for the cars has
been tapering off and the company has offered its dealers incentives
to get customers in showrooms.
   Heaney said there may be another problem.
   ``There's going to be a new Accord launched in the fall and when
you know that, why do you want to buy last year's model?'' she said.
   Among the Big Three, Ford sold cars at a daily rate of 6,923
during early July this year, up from a 5,919 car-a-day rate during
the same time last year. Ford's car sales so far this year were
running 2.5 percent behind last year's pace.
   Ford truck dealers were selling 3.6 percent more vehicles in
early July this year than last year, but 3.8 percent fewer so far
this year.
   GM's car sales went at a daily rate of 10,615 during early July
this year compared with a rate of 9,534 during the same time last
year. GM's car sales for the year were down 9 percent from last year.
   The company's truck sales ran 13.2 percent ahead of last year's
pace in early July but were down 2.8 percent for the entire year.
   Chrysler's car sales fell to a daily rate of 2,921 this year from
the 3,100 daily rate of a year ago. For the calendar year,
Chrysler's car sales were down 14.6 percent.
   Chrysler's trucks sold at a rate 1.6 percent higher in early July
this year than they did a year ago. For the year, Chrysler's truck
sales were down 0.7 percent.

<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. reported a 27 percent
drop in its second-quarter earnings and blamed much of the fall on
the costs of three aircraft programs.
   The aerospace company said its after-tax earnings in the second
quarter fell to $77 million, or $1.20 a share, from $106 million, or
$1.77 a share, in 1988's second quarter.
   Revenue declined 3 percent to $2.45 billion from $2.53 billion a
year earlier.
   Dan Tellep, Lockheed's chairman and chief executive, said the
deterioration in profit reflected $27 million in costs involving
three aircraft programs.
   One of the programs included a phase-out of Lockheed's P-3
aircraft production. The plane designed for hunting submarines had
no customer prospects.
   The U.S. Navy last year selected Lockheed for development of the
P-7A, a new generation anti-sub plane.
   The other two programs on which cost adjustments were made
involve fixed-price development contracts for modifications to two
Air Force C-5As to transport space cargo and modification of a C-141
for an advance radar test bed.
   The overall decline in 1989 revenue and earnings was largely due
to the cost of completing the new generation C-5B, Tellep said in a
news release, which called the outlook for new defense contracts
``flat to declining.''
   ``We remain confident that Lockheed's strong core business
programs will provide the basis for resumed earnings growth in
1990,'' Tellep said, pointing to continuing projects such as the
stealth fighter plane and the P-7A.
   Lockheed in April issued 10.7 million shares for the ESOP plan
and successfully thwarted Dallas investor Harold Simmons' effort to
take over the aerospace company.
   Lockheed's move put 17 percent of the company's stock in employee
hands, making it impossible for Simmons to acquire the 85 percent
needed for buyout approval. Lockheed acted before Simmons made a
tender offer.
   For the first half of the year, Lockheed earned $139 million, or
$2.25 a share, down 37 percent from earnings of $220 million, or
$3.61 a share, in 1988's first six months.
   Revenue amounted to $4.45 billion, down from $4.92 billion.

   Pilots at Northwest Airlines continued
mediated contract talks Thursday but a union spokesman said the
group is growing weary of the negotiations.
   ``We have made progress in the past few months but not enough
progress,'' said Andy Murphy, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots
Association. ``This thing has been going on for 2{ years and our
pilots are running out of patience.''
   Curt Kruse, another spokesman for the pilots, told the St. Paul
Pioneer Press Dispatch Wednesday that the union would consider
asking for an impasse, which would free the pilots to strike after a
30-day cooling off period. Such a request would be decided by the
National Mediation Board.
   Kruse told the newspaper the union would back away from
considering such a request only if the two sides reach a tentative
settlement or make substantial progress in their bargaining by
Friday.
   But Murphy backed away from the remark Thursday, saying a request
for an impasse is only one of several options being considered by
the pilots.
   He said the group is likely to make a statement next week about
the status of negotiations, which resumed this week for the first
time since mid-June, when Northwest accepted a $4 billion buyout
proposal from Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi.
   Former Republic Airlines pilots who joined Northwest in the
acquisition of Republic in late 1986 have been without a contract
for the past 2{ years while the contract covering Northwest pilots
expired three years ago.
   Talks to bring the pilots under one pact began in April 1987 and
broke off last November, when 96 percent voted to authorize a
strike. Northwest then requested federal mediation and talks resumed
in December.
   Murphy said more progress has been made in the past two months
than in the previous two years, but he said serious disagreements
remain over wages, work rules and benefits.
   Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said it's a positive sign that
the two sides are still at the bargaining table.
   ``As long as we are meeting we can move toward an agreement,''
said Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons. ``There is momentum there and
hopefully we can keep that going.''

<HEAD>Lawsuit Says Buyout was Attempt to Shirk Asbestos Claims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers seeking to represent more than 80,000
people filed suit Thursday against the investment firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. and leveraged buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. seeking to reverse the $2.4 billion takeover of Jim
Walter Corp. two years ago.
   The lawsuit, filed in state court in Beaumont, claims the buyout
was a fraudulent attempt to escape more than $3 billion in
liabilities stemming from asbestos claims against Celotex Corp., a
subsidiary of Tampa, Fla.-based home-builder Jim Walter, also named
as a defendant.
   Jim Walter last year sold Celotex, a long-time producer of
asbestos, which has been proven to cause cancer and other health
problems.
   ``I think this will prove to be a landmark case in this
country,'' Houston attorney Stephen Susman said after the lawsuit
was filed.
   However, spokesman for Kohlberg Kravis and Jim Walter said the
claims were similar to those in a suit already in federal court and
were without merit.
   The suit, which asks for class action status, seeks no monetary
damages for three named plaintiffs or for the thousands of others it
says have similar, separate lawsuits pending in courts around the
country.
   Instead, it attempts to prevent the further sale of any Jim
Walter assets and to hold Kohlberg Kravis and the remaining
corporate structure responsible for any judgments related to
asbestos-related lawsuits.
   ``We want to undo this transaction,'' Susman said. ``We want the
people responsible for this transaction to be liable for any
judgments in favor of more than 80,000 people who are seeking
justice.''
   The suit alleges Kohlberg Kravis' 1987 buyout of Jim Walter was
part of a scheme by Jim Walter to evade its liability in the growing
number of lawsuits being filed against Celotex.
   ``The intended effect of these transactions was to strip Jim
Walter of virtually all of its valuable assets and, as a necessary
consequence, to limit the resources available to satisfy asbestos
judgments against Celotex and Jim Walter,'' the lawsuit states.
   About $2 billion of the buyout was financed by bank loans, and
the investment group led by Kohlberg Kravis later sold bonds through
Drexel to replace the bank debt. Selected Jim Walter assets have
since been sold to help pay for the deal.
   ``This was a standard, garden-variety leveraged buyout,'' Jim
Walter spokesman David Townsend said Thursday. ``Consequently, our
position has been and continues to be that the allegations set forth
in the previous (federal) complaint and in this complaint are
totally without merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously.''
   The federal suit is similar, but names neither Drexel or Kohlberg
Kravis as defendants and is limited to those plaintiffs who filed
their asbestos lawsuits within the Eastern District of Texas, Susman
said.
   Kohlberg Kravis spokesman Tom Daly said the lawsuit addressed
``the same substantive issues that are already in federal court.
That suit is without merit, and we think we'll win it.''
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the firm declined comment on
the suit since it had not seen it.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended July 3, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,101.1 billion from $3.093.9 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$3,992.0 billion from $3,977.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $777.4 billion from $769.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3
percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since early
1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,081.9 billion, a 1.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,963.7 billion, up 3.1 percent, while M1 fell
5.5 percent to an average of $775.7 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $714 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $530 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$612 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $382 million
in the two weeks ended July 12, up from $221 million in the previous
two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $289.5 billion in the two-week period ended June 28, down from
$290.0 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Soybeans Rally on Ferruzzi Lawsuit News; Sugar Soars</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rebounded Thursday on the Chicago Board of
Trade following news of a legal challenge to the exchange's order
that traders liquidate their holdings in the July soybean contract.
   Wheat and oat futures also advanced while corn futures finished
mixed.
   On other markets, sugar futures soared amid rumors of Soviet
buying; cattle futures were up sharply; pork futures were mixed;
energy futures advanced; and precious metals were mixed.
   Soybeans settled 10 cents to 17{ cents higher with the contract
for delivery in July up 11 cents at $6.97{ a bushel.
   Two subsidiaries of Italian agribusiness giant Ferruzzi
Finanziara SpA filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Chicago
seeking an injunction against the Board of Trade's emergency
directive.
   The exchange's order, issued Tuesday, was widely seen as an
attempt to block an attempt by Ferruzzi to control the soybean
market.
   Soybeans had opened strongly higher on Wednesday's government
report of smaller-than-expected soybean plantings but the market had
eased by midday on profit-taking. Wire service reports of Ferruzzi's
lawsuit appeared at about 1 p.m. CDT.
   ``From the time it showed on the wire, we had a pretty decent
recovery in here,'' said Dale Gustafson, grain market analyst with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   Analysts said the soybean market would likely take its cues
Friday from the outcome of the soybean ruling.
   Corn futures finished narrowly mixed with most of the pressure
stemming from Wednesday's Agriculture Department crop report, which
showed larger-than-expected corn plantings.
   The wheat market got a late boost from rumors that China had
purchased a large quantity of U.S. wheat.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 2} cents higher with July at $3.90} a
bushel; corn was 5} cents lower to { cent higher with July at $2.56\
a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 4{ cents higher with July at $1.48\ a
bushel.
   Sugar futures prices soared on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange on market talk that the Soviet Union was interested in
buying up to 100,000 metric tons of white sugar for August shipment.
   Sugar settled .50 cent to 1.11 cents higher with October at 13.67
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures posted near-limit gains as stronger cash markets
added to the bullish enthusisam generated by expecatations for a
steep decline in supplies by mid-August.
   Market analysts are predicting that next Friday's quarterly USDA
cattle-on-feed report will show a sharp reduction in placements of
cattle on feedlots during the second quarter.
   Live cattle were .62 cent to 1.35 cents higher with August at
71.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent to 1.35 cents
higher with August at 82.95 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower
to .45 cent higher with July at 47.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were 1.2 cents lower to .08 cent higher with July at 28.95 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures are limited to movements of 1.5 cents a pound.
   Energy futures advanced slightly on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on fears that maintenance and platform workers on North Sea
oil rigs might go on strike.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 44 cents
higher with August at $20.35 a barrel; heating oil was .50 cent to
.72 cent higher with August at 49.44 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent to .28 cent higher with August at 57.46 cents
a gallon.
   Gold futures slipped a bit and silver inched higher in subdued
trading ahead of Friday's bevy of economic reports.
   Gold settled $1.70 to $1.90 lower with August at $378.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.3 cent to 0.7 cent higher with July at $5.195 a
troy ounce.

<HEAD>McCaw, Lin Discuss $127.50 a Share Buy-Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. is
discussing a $127.50 per share buyout offer for LIN Broadcasting
Corp. that would give LIN shareholders stock in McCaw, the companies
said Thursday.
   A McCaw spokesman said the new cash and common stock offer
replaces the $110 per share cash offer McCaw made for LIN on Monday
following a New York court settlement unfavorable to LIN. That offer
was to expire July 21.
   The new offer raises to $6.2 billion the total amount McCaw would
have to spend to acquire the 90.2 percent of LIN's 53.9 million
shares that it does not already own. The $110 a share offer was
worth $5.36 billion.
   If the Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw's takeover attempt is
successful, it would solidify McCaw's position as the nation's
largest cellular telephone company.
   The new offer came after LIN complained that the $110 per share
offer was less than what McCaw believes LIN is worth.
   The offer of ``$110 (per share) is gone. Negotiations led to a
higher price potential,'' said Steven Bruce of Abernathy MacGregor,
McCaw's outside public investor relations counsel in New York.
   He said the price was upped in ``an attempt to reach a friendly
transaction.''
   Negotiations resumed between the two companies' advisers on
Tuesday.
   Bruce said the cash portion of the new offer could be higher than
$110 per share. McCaw had originally bid $120 per share for McCaw.
   The amount of McCaw that would be held by LIN will be determined
by the final cash offer and the price of McCaw stock on the day a
deal is closed, Bruce said. It is not clear if the Class A common
stock would be new stock or existing shares, he said. The shares
will have voting rights, he said.
   The offer ``means participation by LIN in McCaw,'' he said. When
asked if LIN wants participation on McCaw's board, he said,
``Everything is under discussion.''
   Trading in both companies' stocks was heavy on Thursday. They are
each traded in the over-the-counter market.
   McCaw closed at $40 per share, down 12{ cents, on a trading
volume of 1.1 million shares. LIN rose $2.50 a share to $116.75 on
volume of nearly 1.8 million shares.
   In a joint statement, the companies said the proposal provides
for each share of LIN stock to be exchanged for cash and stock
having an aggregate value of $127.50 a share.
   The companies cautioned that ``there can be no assurances'' the
new offer will result in an agreement.
   The announcement came a day after McCaw disclosed in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that McCaw and LIN had
``recommenced negotiations through their advisers.''
   The New York Court of Appeals recently denied LIN's claims to
certain cellular interests of Metromedia Co. in the New York City
and Philadelphia markets.

<HEAD>Group Leading 3-Year-Old GE Boycott Claims It's Bruised Company's
Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An antinuclear group that has led a General
Electric Co. boycott for three years released figures Thursday aimed
at showing the campaign has cost the corporate giant $50.6 million
in lost business. GE rejected the claims.
   The group INFACT based the calculation on the number of people
whom it said have joined the boycott in an attempt to drive GE and
other defense contractors out of the nuclear weapons industry.
   ``GE wants you to think it brings good things to life,'' said
Nancy Cole, executive director of the group. ``It also brings death
and destruction. We think that's got to be stopped.''
   INFACT stands for Infant Formula Action Coalition. The
Boston-based group organized a boycott of the Nestle Co. a decade
ago to stop that company from selling what INFACT said was unsafe
powdered baby's milk. The group switched to the GE boycott in July
1986 and has claimed widespread success.
   By INFACT's calculations, at least 2.53 million people worldwide
have stopped buying GE products because of the boycott, resulting in
lost revenue to the company of $25.32 million in heavily populated
areas of the United States and an equal amount elsewhere.
   GE spokesman George Jamison rejected INFACT's assertions.
   ``Anybody can claim anything,'' Jamison said. ``The facts of the
matter are, since 1985 GE revenues are up 56 percent from $32
billion to $50 billion. Earnings are up 49 percent. Also during that
time, market share has increased in all GE consumer businesses.
These are facts which are reported in our annual report. They speak
for themselves.''
   GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., makes products ranging from
dishwashers to jet engines to high-tech medical equipment. It is one
of the nation's leading defense contractors and the fifth-largest
U.S. industrial concern.
   The company also owns the NBC television network and a
controlling interest in Kidder Peabody Group Inc., a large Wall
Street investment firm.
   INFACT has targeted GE because of what it calls ``the company's
extensive involvement in the production and promotion of nuclear
weaons and the trail of radioactive and toxic waste the company's
nuclear weapons work leaves behind.''
   Jamison said ``INFACT's goal is unilateral disarmament. We want
peace every bit as much as INFACT does. But along with a majority of
the American people, GE believes it can be assured only by a strong
national defense.''

   General Electric Co., in response to an
inquiry from the New York Stock Exchange, said Thursday that it had
no discussions about nor interest in acquiring Honeywell Inc.
   The Fairfield, Conn., company issued its brief statement after
Honeywell stock jumped $6 a share to close at $85.50 on the
exchange. GE stock was unchanged at $54.38{.
   GE did not comment beyond its statement and stock exchange
officials left work before they could be contacted about it.
   Late last week, analysts attributed a similar increase in
Honeywell's stock price to a rumor published in Business Week that
GE was considering acquiring the automated controls makers. General
Electric previously declined to comment on the rumor, and Honeywell
has refused to comment on all takeover speculation.
   Before Honeywell stock declined $1.75 Tuesday, it had been pushed
up more than $9 in the two previous days of trading. It was down
slightly Wednesday before surging again Thursday, when more than 2.1
million shares traded hands.
   ``The stock is trading very heavily,'' said Kurt Rivard of
Minneapolis-based Dain Bosworth Inc. ``The action you're seeing in
Honeywell can be attributed to more than the General Electric
rumor.''
   Rivard said Honeywell's value to an acquirer could range from
$110 a share to $140 a share.
   Thursday's trading included the sale of a 500,000-share block of
Honeywell stock at the market price, Rivard said. It was unclear who
moved the block, he said.
   Takeover rumors concerning Honeywell intensified after the
company lost $435 million in its fiscal 1988.
   Chairman James Renier said at the company's annual meeting May 5
that the speculation was inevitable given the ``discrepancy between
stock market values and perceived true-asset values.''
   With the exception of fiscal 1987, Honeywell's financial
performance has lagged for the past seven years.
   The company sought approval at the annual meeting of two
anti-takeover measures. But an opposition group led by North
American Partners of Fort Worth, Texas, lobbied to defeat the
proposals in a proxy fight.
   North American has said it is not interested in acquiring
Honeywell.

   A House-Senate conference trying to craft a
savings and loan bailout bill adjourned Thursday night after 5{
hours of bitter and fruitless debate over how to proceed on a Senate
compromise proposal.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady issued a statement that the
administration would ``strongly support'' the Senate offer, although
he said he wanted to review the details.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., the leader of the five-member
Senate team, suprised many House members by starting the session
with a Senate offer for a comprehensive compromise and asking them
to consider it overnight or over the weekend.
   But the huge, 94-member House delegation was unable to respond
because its leader, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, has divided the
delegation into platoons of between 20 and 30 members, each with
jurisdiction over part of the bill.
   House delegates responded to Riegle by voting to put the Senate
offer aside and proceeded to try to tackle the massive S&amp;L bill
issue by issue as senators sat, rolling their eyes.
   The House side made proposals on capital standards and funding,
essentially mirroring the original House bill, but the Senate
refused to consider them.
   At the end of the session shortly after 8 p.m., the only thing
the two sides could agree on was a motion to meet at 10 a.m. Friday
and try again.
   Riegle, explaining that each position in the Senate offer was
``cross-connected'' with the others, said the Senate could not
proceed as the House wished and could only respond to a package
counter offer from the House.
   ``I don't think we're communicating here,'' Sen. John Heinz,
R-Pa., said.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said Riegle had made a ``bold,
imaginative offer designed to seize the leadership of the
conference.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, released a letter written from
Hungary by President Bush, who expressed strong support for the
administration's plan to keep S&amp;L rescue spending out of the budget
deficit.
   It's the first time Bush has addressed the issue personally,
although Brady has threatened to recommend a veto if Congress fails
to adopt the administration plan. Bush did not raise the threat of a
veto in the letter.
   The conference committee, which held its first substantive
session on Tuesday, is trying to resolve differences between the
Senate bill passed in April and the House bill passed in June.
   Both sides, noting that savings and loans are losing at least $10
million a day, say urgent action is needed and are aiming to send a
compromise to the White House for Bush's signature before Congress
leaves on its August vacation.
   Among the key elements of the Senate offer are:
   _Acceptance of the House's plan to require S&amp;L owners to risk $3
in real, tangible capital for every $100 in lending by Jan. 1, 1995.
The Senate bill had provided a laxer standard of $1.50.
   _Adoption of the Senate and Bush administration plan to keep S&amp;L
rescue spending out of the budget deficit. The House had favored a
plan that would have swelled the deficit by $44 billion over three
years, arguing that it was a more honest way of accounting for the
spending.
   _A compromise on junk bond ownership by S&amp;Ls, limiting S&amp;Ls to a
junk bond portfolio equal to 6 percent of their assets or twice the
amount of their capital. The House had wanted to require S&amp;Ls to
sell their junk bonds within two years, while the Senate bill has a
more liberal junk bond limit of 11 percent of assets.
   _Acceptance, with modification, of House provisions requiring the
S&amp;L industry-owned Federal Home Loan Banks to subsidize housing for
poor people and forcing banks and S&amp;Ls to disclose their record of
serving poor and minority people.
   _Adoption of a Senate clause guaranteeing Federal Home Loan Bank
Board Chairman M. Danny Wall the right to serve the two years
remaining in his term. The offer also retains Wall's authority over
state-chartered S&amp;Ls. The House had wanted to transfer that
authority to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Gonzalez complained that the offer was too vague and amounted to
little more than a letter of intent. He told reporters that the
senators, by proceeding with a broad offer rather than sticking to
the conference agenda, may wind up delaying ultimate enactment of
the bill.
   In a 6{-hour session Tuesday, legislators agreed to raise civil
and criminal fines for bank and S&amp;L fraud to a maximum of $1 million
a day and the maximum jail term to five years.

   A British company that owns about
10 percent of a casino's parent company received casino licensing
Thursday from the state Casino Control Commission.
   Bass PLC of London owns more than 200 Holiday Inns around the
world, including 13 in the United States. Bass also owns and
operates 13 breweries in the United Kingdom, thousands of pubs and
more than 90 hotels in Europe.
   As part of the transaction to purchase the Holiday Inns, Holiday
Corp., which owns the hotel chain, issued Bass a $100 million
subordinated debenture that can be converted into 9.99 percent of
Holiday's stock.
   Because of the possible stock conversion and because Holiday
Corp. owns Harrah's Marina Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, Bass
had to meet certain New Jersey's casino licensing requirements.
   At a hearing Thursday, without opposition from the state Division
of Gaming Enforcement, Bass received its license. All Bass profits
that had been placed in trust during the licensing investigation may
now be released.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar started higher at the start of
Friday's trading, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
rebounded slightly from Thursday's close.
   The dollar opened at 139.60 yen, up 0.55 yen from Thursday's
close of 139.05 yen. In New York, it ended at 139.50 yen overnight.
   Trading was quiet as dealers waited for the release of major U.S
economic indicators later Friday, including the nation's wholesale
price index for June, traders said.
   The market expects the index to be only slighty lower than the
previous month, said a Bank of Tokyo trader, speaking on condition
of anonymity. A lower figure would mean inflation is slowing.
   ``If the figure is larger than our expectation, it could be a
major dollar-buying incentive,'' he said.
   ``Considering the dollar is not declining now despite our
expectation for quite some time over the possible relaxation of
monetary policy, I see little incentive for further
dollar-selling,'' the trader added.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which shed 70.36 points Thuarsday, inched up within the
first 15 minutes of morning trading to 33,660.00, up 24.84 points,
or 0.07 percent.
   The index's rise in Tokyo followed a rise in the Dow Jones
industrial average of 30 major issues in New York overnight, dealers
said.

<HEAD>First Skyscraper in Years Planned For Dallas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The developer of Dallas' upscale Galleria shopping
and office complex announced plans Thursday to build a signature
office tower for Oryx Energy Co., the city's first major skyscraper
construction in several years.
   The announcement of the 26- to 28-story building does not
necessarily mean the city's lagging real estate market has
recovered, analysts said, but nevertheless is welcome.
   ``I don't think it signals a turnaround; it signals a situation
where you had a large user with a specific need,'' said Thomas
Katopody, a partner in the Dallas office of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co.
accountants. He said there is a two-year supply of office space
already built, with about a one-year inventory of Class A space.
   Neither will the tower add to downtown's distinctive skyline, as
it will be built about seven miles north of the central business
district near the intersection of two major highways.
   The building will be part of the Galleria complex, which includes
two office towers _ one of 24 stories and one of 25 _ a Westin hotel
and a four-story shopping mall. The complex was built by Houston
developer Gerald D. Hines Interests.
   Nearby is the 24-story Occidental Tower, headquarters of
Occidental Chemical Corp., a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   Staman Ogilvie, executive vice president of Hines, refused to
discuss the building's cost, but analysts said it could run as high
as $200 a square foot, or about $118 million for the 590,000 square
feet.
   Construction will begin after the first of the year, with Oryx,
North America's largest independent oil company, moving in by the
end of 1991, Ogilvie said.
   Neither he nor the company would disclose leasing or equity
arrangements, and Ogilvie said the company still is pursuing
financing.
   He said many financiers were surprised when contacted about new
construction in Dallas, but Oryx' long-term lease commitment makes
the project ``a very `financiable' undertaking.''
   The Oryx headquarters had been a hotly contested prize in Dallas'
hungry real estate community. But company officials said there just
wasn't enough quality space in one place, despite millions of empty
square feet available.
   ``We wanted a building where we would be the only tenant, or at
least the major tenant,'' Oryx Chairman Robert P. Hauptfuhrer said.
``We want to establish a definite identity and presence in the
business community, so a Dallas location that will be recognized by
all as the Oryx Energy Building was a major consideration.''
   Oryx will move about 1,000 of its employees into the new building
from two locations elsewhere in Dallas.
   Oryx formerly was known as Sun Exploration &amp; Production Co.
before it was spun off last year by parent Sun Co., which kept the
retailing and refining end of the business.
   The last major skyscraper built in Dallas was Cityplace Center, a
42-story building announced in 1984 and completed last year. It
remains about half empty, occupied mainly by builder Southland
Corp., owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain.
   Most of the city's other towers were finished by 1987 and none
are currently under construction.

   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was named
managing agent Thursday for nine savings and loans institutions in
the new joint federal regulatory oversight program.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. named the FDIC
managing agent for four institutions in Texas, two in Nebraska, two
in Oklahoma and one in Indiana. Federal regulators transferred all
deposits, offices and substantially all of their assets and certain
liabilities to newly created federal mutual institutions.
   Depositors are not affected in any way by the action and can
continue to transact business as usual, said M. Danny Wall, chairman
of the Federal Home Loan Bank.
   Placed in receivership Thursday and issued new federal charters
by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board were: Pioneer Federal Savings
and Loan Association, Plymouth, Ind.; Cornerstone Savngs
Association, Houston; First Federal Savings and Loan Association,
Waco, Texas; and Cross Roads Savings and Loan Association, Checotah,
Okla.
   The four insolvent institutions make a total of 237 savings and
loans in 33 states under FDIC management.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Thursday's action was taken
to conserve the associations' assets. The four new institutions did
not assume any obligations to stockholders or holder of subordinated
debt of the insolvent thrifts.
   The remaining five institutions have been under joint
conservatorship of the FSLIC and the FDIC for months. Continental
Federal Savings and Loan Association, Oklahoma City, began March 16;
San Antonio Savings Association, San Antonio, Texas, joined March 2;
Centennial Savings Bank, Greenville, Texas, joined April 6; and both
Occidental-Nebraska Federal Savings Bank, Omaha, and Platte Valley
Federal Savings and Loan Association, Gering, Neb. joined Feb. 17.
   In Nebraska, the newly chartered mutual associations are
Occidental Nebraska Savings Bank, F.S.B., and Platte Valley Savings.
   In Texas, the new associations are San Antonio Savings
Association, F.A., Centennial Federal Savings and Loan Association,
F.A. and First Savings and Loan Association, F.A. Centennial Federal
assumed no obligations to the stockholders of the former insolvent
thrift.
   In Oklahoma, the new associations are Continental Federal Savings
and Loan Association, F.A. and Cross Roads Savings and Loan
Association, F.A.
   The new association in Indiana is Pioneer Savings, F.A.
   Officials said the institutions will operate as usual and will
continue to maintain the same business hours.
   The joint regulatory oversight teams lead by the FDIC include
staff from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
and the Federal Reserve Board.
   As managing agent, the FDIC works to conserve assets and preserve
banking services until Congress approves funds for a permanent
solution to S&amp;L problems.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   A federal judge Thursday denied a request by an
Italian company to block a Chicago Board of Trade order that is
forcing the firm to sell a huge quantity of soybean futures.
   The lawsuit filed by Ferruzzi Trading International SA and
Ferruzzi USA Inc., both subsidiaries of Ferruzzi Finanziara SpA,
sought the restraining order and a permanent injunction against the
exchange's directive. Published reports have said the firm was the
object of the directive because it was trying to corner the soybean
market _ something Ferruzzi spokesmen deny.
   The lawsuit claimed Ferruzzi had been irreparably injured by the
Board of Trade's order, which it said would diminish confidence in
the market and hurt U.S. farmers.
   But U.S. District Judge James Zagel, who denied the request for a
temporary injunction, said blocking the CBOT's order could cause
harm to the public.
   ``The preservation of procedures adopted by the Board of Trade is
in the interest of the public,'' Zagel said in issuing his
late-afternoon decision.
   Ferruzzi's attorney, James Fox, said he did not know whether the
Italian firm would pursue the lawsuit or seek monetary damages.
   CBOT Chairman Karsten Mahlmann praised the decision. He told a
news conference late Thursday that there were over 40 million July
soybean contracts open and abnormally low levels of stocks available
to satisfy the contracts _ which would have resulted in a number of
defaults without the exchange's order.
   He said the exchange's business conduct committee tried to
promote the orderly liquidation of the contracts, but not enough
market participants responded.
   During the hearing before Zagel, Fox said the emergency order
forced the Italian firm to reduce its holdings of July soybean
contracts by 20 percent on Wednesday and another 20 percent
Thursday. He said the order ``did irreparable damage to Ferruzzi.''
   CBOT attorney John E. Angle said the exchange had entered into
discussions with Ferruzzi officials and had asked them to reduce
their futures contracts, but they refused to comply.
   Board of Trade spokesman Raymond Carmichael said previously the
exchange would ``vigorously'' fight the lawsuit.
   Soybean futures prices rose sharply Thursday in reaction to news
of the lawsuit. Soybeans for delivery in July settled at $6.97{ a
bushel, 11 cents above the previous day's settlement. The July
contract skidded 39{ cents on Wednesday.
   In two related developments, the American Soybean Association
called for an investigation of the Board of Trade's directive and
the Minnesota agriculture commissioner asked the FBI to check
whether Board of Trade officials may have benefited from the effects
of the order.
   The Board of Trade, the world's largest market for grain and
soybean futures, issued the emergency order Tuesday requiring any
player holding obligations to receive or deliver more than 3 million
bushels of soybeans for July delivery to reduce those holdings to 1
million bushels by the end of trading Thursday, when the July
contract expires.
   Ferruzzi's lawsuit said the company holds obligations to take
delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans. Ferruzzi also is
believed to own a large quantity of physical soybeans.
   If it does not reduce its position in the futures market,
Ferruzzi theoretically could force those on the other end of its
futures contracts to deliver, possibly causing a scramble for
supplies that would drive the price of its soybeans up sharply.
   Ferruzzi has said it accumulated large soybean supplies to keep
its processing plants running and to meet export commitments, and
that its large futures market position was a hedge against price
fluctuations.
   Carmichael said the exchange's board of directors issued its
order because it appeared there might not be enough deliverable
soybeans available to satisfy all the contracts.
   The Board of Trade did not mention Ferruzzi in its order and has
refused to further explain the reasons for its decision. However,
rumors among market watchers have pointed to Ferruzzi.
   In issuing the order, the exchange cited federal regulations that
allow it take such action to ensure the orderly expiration of a
futures contract.
   The St. Louis-based American Soybean Association urged the Board
of Trade to fully explain the reasons behind its order to soybean
producers and processors, and saying failure to do so would be
``another blow to the credibility of the board.''
   Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Jim Nichols on Wednesday asked
the FBI to investigate whether any Board of Trade officials
benefited from the emergency order.
   In a letter to FBI director William Sessions, Nichols said it was
possible that some BOT board members who made the order held short
positions _ obligations to sell soybeans _ and benefited from the
price drop following the order.
   Exchange spokesmen would not comment on the developments.
   But an exchange official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
dismissed as sour grapes the complaints of traders who ended up on
the losing side of Wednesday's dizzying drop in soybean prices.
   ``Any time you have any sort of order affecting the market you're
going to have someone complaining about it,'' he said. ``Someone is
always on the other side.''
   Some traders said the exchange should have left the market alone
to sort itself out. Others said the emergency order spawned
confusion and public mistrust at time when the Board of Trade's
image has been tarnished by a federal investigation of suspected
trading fraud.
   Exchange member James Merritt, a 22-year veteran of the grain
pits, said soybean farmers _ a group the Board of Trade has been
wooing for years _ felt betrayed.
   ``They feel like, why should they try to legitimately hedge when
the sanctity of the contracts are being questioned,'' said Merritt,
research director for Merchants Trading Co.
   ``They're having second thoughts about this right now and I think
I probably speak for the entire brokerage community in saying that
it's become quite an emotional issue.''
