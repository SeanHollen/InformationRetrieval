   Police fought armed bands in the
capital and hungry mobs in Rosario on Tuesday, and the death toll
reached 11. Officials talked of handing out free food to stop
looting sparked by soaring inflation.
   Six more people were reported killed Tuesday. In the Buenos
Aires suburbs of San Miguel and Quilmes, looters loading food into
trucks threw stones at police who tried to stop them, and police
fired rubber bullets back, killing four, local news agencies said.
   It was part of a riot along a 120-block stretch in which looters
broke windows and emptied shelves in furniture stores, bars, sports
and shoe stores. A bus driver tried to prevent his bus from being
stolen and was fatally shot.
   In the Buenos Aires suburb of Moreno, a sixth person was killed
Tuesday ``under confusing circumstances,'' local news agencies
repoted.
   By Tuesday night, the roving bands of youths that prompted many
stores to close had scattered, and Interior Minister Juan Carlos
Pugliese said he would not deploy federal troops.
   But in Rosario, Argentina's third-biggest city and the country's
meatpacking capital, armed bands drove through deserted streets,
shot at police stations and looted private homes as well as stores.
   ``They left practically nothing standing,'' Mayor Santos Mauro
of the suburban Rosario town of Villa Gobernador Galvez said.
``They overwhelmed everything _ supermarkets, shops, shoe stores.''
Family homes were damaged.
   Lesser scale looting was reported in the western city of
Mendoza, the country's fourth-biggest, the provincial capitals of
La Plata and Tucuman, and about a dozen working class suburbs of
Buenos Aires.
   In Buenos Aires on Tuesday, bombs damaged buildings housing two
political parties. Noise bombs set off in the central business
district injured six passersby. But by Tuesday night, the bombings
had ended.
   Five people were killed earlier this week in Rosario, including
four men who were shot and a woman who suffered a heart attack, and
60 were injured by tear gas, rubber bullets, stones and clubs. More
than 1,000 people have been arrested in Rosario and about 500
looters arrested in other cities.
   Congress debated the 30-day state of siege declared Monday by
President Raul Alfonsin.
   Four young men dragged a side of beef from a supermarket in
Rosario, a city of 1 million 185 miles north of the capital. One
cut it into quarters with a knife and said: ``We're not looking for
whisky or wine, as they say others are doing. We just want
something to eat.''
   Looters walked past police and broke into food stores before
police clamped down.
   ``Thank God, today I can eat!'' an elderly woman shouted as she
rushed out of a grocery store with looted goods.
   About 1,000 additional border police were deployed in Rosario,
Argentina's third-largest city and the scene of the worst looting
and clashes the past three days.
   The lootings began last week when a supermarket in Mendoza, the
country's fourth-biggest city, was firebombed, and police in
Cordoba, the second-largest, confiscated boxes of Molotov cocktails.
   Months of economic chaos have brought the pay of many
Argentines, in terms of equivalent buying power, to $25 a month or
less. Monthly inflation is estimated at 70 percent for May, the
national currency has been devalued by 90 percent since February,
and thousands of people have been thrown out of work.
   On Sunday, Alfonsin revealed his plans for stabilizing the
economy. His Radical Civic Union lost the May 14 national elections
to the Peronists, but there is a seven-month lag between election
and inauguration.
   Hunger marches were held in two cities Monday, and stores were
looted in more than a dozen. In Tucuman, 600 boxes of powdered milk
were stolen from a warehouse.
   Government officials in the biggest provinces scrambled to set
up free food programs in an effort to forestall violence.
   ``It's a first step and we know it will be insufficient ...
because the magnitude of the crisis overwhelms the capacity of
provincial finances, '' said Buenos Aires Province official Mario
Cafiero.
   Cordoba has given tons of food to the needy, and Mendoza plans
to do the same.
   In Rosario, schools were closed and shopkeepers bricked up glass
fronts to protect their property. All business activity, including
movies, bars, restaurants, was ordered to cease at 6 p.m.
   At one store that had been looted three times, owner Daniel
Rodriguez said: ``I have two alternatives: I can put the little I
have left in the street and give it away or I can just set fire to
it all.''
   National government officials have blamed the looting on leftist
agitators, citing the degree of organization and the theft of
non-food items, but have not accused specific organizations.
   Vice President Victor Martinez blamed ``groups that do not want
to see the current government end its term and another
constitutional government begin.''
   President-elect Carlos Menem is to be installed Dec. 10 under
the constitution. His refusal last week to assume office early
contributed to a political paralysis that leaves Alfonsin's
government little credibility and gives the government-elect little
power.
   Menem said Monday he supported the state of siege, as did
Antonio Cafiero, president of the Peronist Party and governor of
Buenos Aires province.
   Foreign exchange houses were allowed to open for the first time
in five business days Tuesday, and banks resumed operations with
restrictions.
   Many exchange houses refused to sell dollars at the official
rate of 175 australs. Bank withdrawals were limited to 40,000
australs.

   The FBI is conducting a preliminary inquiry
into allegations of payroll padding on the staff of Rep. William
Gray, a Pennsylvania Democrat who is seeking a leadership post in
the House, sources said Tuesday night.
   Gray, who is seeking the majority whip position in anticipation
of the expected resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright, confirmed
earlier in the day that he had been approached by two
Philadelphia-based FBI agents on Monday.
   But Gray denounced as an ``outrageous lie'' a televised report
that he was under criminal investigation.
   The congressman said that he had been specifically told by the
agents that he was neither a target nor a subject of a criminal
investigation.
   But government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed a CBS News report that the FBI was conducting a
preliminary inquiry into allegations regarding personnel and
expenditures in the congressman's office.
   One source said there were allegations of a no-show employee
being kept on Gray's payroll. The source stressed, however, that
the FBI's inquiry was at this point preliminary and agents did not
know whether it would lead to a full-scale criminal investigation.
   Though Gray denied that he was a target or subject, under the
FBI's definition of a preliminary inquiry, no one is a subject or
target of such a probe.
   ``I was told over and over again that I was not under
investigation,'' Gray said in a statement to reporters, adding that
FBI agents told him Monday that an employee or employees of his
office had been under investigation for several months.
   ``We pledged to provide any materials or documents to assist in
this investigation,'' Gray said, denying that he was in any way
uncooperative.
   Gray is chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and a candidate
for the House majority whip post being opened up by the planned
resignation of Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif. The report comes as
Democrats await the expected resignation of Wright, who faces 69
charges by the House ethics committee.
   ``As I am in the midst of a leadership race in which some have
said I am the front runner, I have to question the sources of these
leaks and their motives as well as their timing,'' Gray said.
   CBS said FBI agents visited Gray this past weekend seeking his
cooperation. ``It was not forthcoming,'' CBS said, adding that the
sources said subpoenas likely would be issued within weeks.
   Gray disputed the CBS account.
   ``On Memorial Day I was contacted for the first time by two
agents assigned to the FBI's office in Philadelphia,'' Gray said.
``During the conversation with the agents I was told over and over
again that I was not under investigation nor the target of an
investigation. I was told that the bureau was looking into
allegations about an employee or employees and that they had been
looking into these allegations for the past four to five months.''
   Gray, the highest ranking black in Congress, appeared on a CBS
program Sunday and said he was confident the Democratic
congressional leadership, recently rocked by ethical problems of
Wright and a questionable financial deal involving Coelho, was
headed for better times.
   ``I know that all of us feel very confident,'' Gray said. ``I
know this member feels very confident, that there are no problems.''
   Coelho announced on Saturday that he will leave the House on
June 15 and Wright is expected to resign possibly as early as
Wednesday.

   Tran Phuc Sanh spent 14 years saving
for the day when he could pay a crime syndicate $1,000 to spirit
him away from Vietnam.
   When it came, he climbed aboard a leaky boat bound for the
Philippines, surviving on seaweed and urine during an arduous
journey that ended in April. He hopes to go to the United States.
   ``Right now, I am very happy, but I long for the family,'' said
Sanh, who made the journey with a daughter but left behind his wife
and two sons. ``I long my wife and my children. I think, for sure,
we will be together again.''
   Sanh is part of a new increase in the number of people willing
to scrape together their life's savings and risk their lives to
flee Vietnam in shoddy vessels provided by criminals.
   According to the United Nations, nearly 72,000 ``boat people''
were in Southeast Asian refugee camps at the end of April, compared
with nearly 41,000 by the same time last year _ a nearly 60 percent
rise.
   Fourteen years after the Vietnam War, the threat of pirates,
prison-like refugee camps and countless days at sea without food
and water have not discouraged the exodus. But the unrelenting flow
has put new pressure on Vietnam to find a solution.
   Filipino authorities report a 300 percent increase in the number
of arrivals this year. Malaysia recorded 11,500 arrivals between
January and May 20, nearly double the same period last year.
Another 10,012 landed in Hong Kong during the first five months,
about double the number for the same period in 1988.
   Since 1975, more than 1.5 million Vietnamese have fled their
homeland by sea.
   The desperation to leave can lead to remarkable feats. On
Monday, a small wooden boat carrying 107 Vietnamese refugees landed
on an uninhabited island in southwestern Japan after a 40-day
voyage, officials said.
   It was the first time since 1977 that a boat carrying Vietnamese
refugees reached Japan directly from Vietnam, the office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Japan said.
   The Vietnamese, whose numbers included 14 children, told
investigators they left because of their hard lives and because
they wanted to live in a ``peaceful place,'' officials said.
   Under international pressure, Vietnam has agreed to attend a
conference in Geneva, Switzerland, on June 13 on ways to curb the
exodus and arrange for the legal departure of those who want to
emigrate.
   But some officials fear Vietnam will use the meeting to pressure
the United States, Japan and other developed countries for more
economic aid.
   U.N. and government officials are uncertain what has caused the
latest increase. Some suspect Vietnamese are rushing to get out
before the Geneva conference, fearing it will result in agreement
to stem the flow.
   ``People are feeling that this is their last chance,'' said a
Western relief agency official based in Bangkok.
   But Filipino officials said most of the refugees arriving here
had not even heard of the Geneva conference. Most say they left
because of deteriorating economic conditions and the hope of a
better life.
   Faced with a growing influx, the six-member Association of
Southeast Asian Nations agreed in March to screen Indochinese
refugees and send back those who cannot prove political persecution.
   But member nations _ Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,
Singapore and the Philippines _ have not uniformly implemented the
new rule pending the outcome of the Geneva conference.
   ``The Geneva conference must find a solution,'' said one
Malaysian official. The official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Malaysia was ``fed up'' with the refugee problem.
   Some relief officials believe the recent increase may force
Malaysia and others to press for the forcible return of boat people.
   But in Hong Kong, a British Crown Colony, officials expect to
spend about $40 million from the local treasury to care for the
more than 34,000 ``boat people'' jammed into enclosed camps in the
already overcrowded territory.
   Under a tougher policy adopted in June, Hong Kong classifies all
Vietnamese arrivals as illegal immigrants, subject to repatriation,
unless they can prove political persecution.
   Those who are assured of relocation in another country are
classified as refugees. Only about 14,000 have been designated
``refugees.''
   Last year, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and Vietnam
agreed on a voluntary repatriation program for Vietnamese in Hong
Kong who have grown tired of waiting for resettlement.
   So far this year, 143 ``boat people'' have returned to Vietnam.
Another 75 are preparing to return in June, officials said.
   Most of the refugees in Southeast Asian camps expect to travel
on to new homes in the United States or Western Europe. Few expect
to settle elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
   But Southeast Asian countries fear developed nations will cut
back further on their quotas, leaving them with thousands of
unwanted refugees.
   The U.S. quota for Vietnamese in 1987 stood at 8,500 from the
Orderly Departure Program _ under which Vietnamese can legally
emigrate _ and 32,000 ``boat people.'' Washington is considering
accepting 50,000 Vietnamese this year.
   Without improvement in the Vietnamese economy, some officials
fear the exodus will continue.
   Porfirio Leyson, acting chief of a Philippine government transit
center, said 70 percent of the refugees say they fled in search of
a better economic future.
   ``For them, it's do or die.'' Leyson said.

   West European leaders gave a quick
stamp of approval to the plan drawn up by President Bush to reduce
sharply U.S. and Soviet troops stationed in Europe by 1993.
   Their formal approval will come today in the communique the NATO
leaders will issue after concluding the two-day, 40th anniversary
summit of the 16-nation military alliance.
   But the sweeping Bush proposal, clearly aimed at seizing the
arms control initiative from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
was greeted at Monday's opening session by unanimous praise.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a staunch U.S. ally,
said the offer had ``transformed the summit,'' which had been
overshadowed by a nagging dispute over the future role of
short-range nuclear arms in Europe.
   NATO foreign ministers early today arrived at compromise
language to solve that dispute.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called Bush's initiative a
``farsighted step'' that ``impressively affirmed the United States'
leadership.''
   ``President Bush has today paved the way for further success of
our alliance,'' Kohl told his colleagues.
   The Western leaders have been dogged in recent weeks by a fight
touched off by a German demand for NATO to enter into early talks
with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact on reducing short-range nuclear
arms in Europe.
   The United States and Britain had opposed immediate bargaining
on those weapons, arguing that the alliance should first focus its
attention on slashing conventional, or non-nuclear, arms in Europe.
   The compromise formula worked out by the foreign ministers in a
post-midnight skull session links the start of short-range missile
talks to completion of a conventional arms treaty. It also
stipulates that no nuclear missiles would be pulled out until the
conventional reductions were completed.
   Even before the ministers fashioned their negotiating strategy,
European officials said the Bush troop initiative had made it
easier to resolve the missile dispute.
   ``The sting is out of the problem,'' said Dutch Prime Minister
Ruud Lubbers. ``It is not of the same urgency any more.''
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney urged the other allies to
back the Bush proposals and turn them over to NATO experts to flesh
out over the next 60 to 90 days.
   The plans would then be put down on the negotiating table at the
conventional arms talks between NATO and the seven-nation Warsaw
Pact. The bargaining, which began in early March in Vienna, covers
an area spanning the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains in the
Soviet Union.
   Spanish Foreign Minister Franciso Fernandez Ordonez said Bush
had given a fresh push to those discussions.
   ``This proposal,'' he said, ``would reduce the possibility of a
surprise attack by the Warsaw Pact.''
   A senior administration official, briefing reporters under cloak
of anonymity, said the response was ``even warmer than anything we
had reason to expect.''
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass said the American offer
came from a Bush administration ``under serious criticism from the
public for the lack of any disarmament initiatives at a time when
the Soviet Union has launched a `peace offensive.''
   Bush called for Washington and Moscow to agree to trim their
troops stationed in Europe to 275,000 on each side.
   This would amount to a 20 percent cut in U.S. combat troops in
Europe, reducing overall U.S. troop strength by about 10 percent.
There are about 150,000 U.S. combat troops in Europe and more than
150,000 support personnel.
   The Soviets have an estimated 625,000 troops in Eastern and
Central Europe. Gorbachev has already offered to cut to 350,000 and
proposed equal ceilings of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces of 1.35
million.
   Bush also called on the Kremlin to make good on a recent
Gorbachev proposal to set ceilings on conventional arms: 20,000
tanks, 28,000 armored troop carriers and 16,500 to 24,000 artillery
pieces, the precise number depending on how those weapons are
defined.
   According to NATO, the West has 16,424 main battle tanks and the
Warsaw Pact has 51,500 heavy tanks, with announced cuts to reduce
that number to 39,500.
   The president also pressed for reductions in combat airplanes
and helicopters to levels 15 percent below the current NATO levels,
or about 5,440 for each side.
   All equipment that was pulled back would be destroyed.
   The French and the British, Western Europe's only nuclear
powers, immediately said they would resist any attempt to include
their dual-capable aircraft _ which can fire both conventional and
nuclear weapons _ in the Bush arms plan.

   With one stroke, President Bush has cut
through years of hand-wringing over Soviet troop levels.
   But problems remain because it is still difficult to determine
who has how many troops, airplanes and artillery and where they all
are.
   Even so, Bush won wide allied endorsement at the NATO summit
meeting here Monday for his four-part conventional arms reduction
proposal.
   ``I congratulate him on this far-sighted step with which he has
once more impressively affirmed the United States' leadership,''
said West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has clashed bitterly
with the United States on the issue of nuclear arms.
   Bush wants the conventional arms talks between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact in Vienna put on the fast track. In fact, he wants a
treaty signed in six to 12 months and implemented by 1993, at the
latest.
   That is faster than even some enthusiastic supporters of the
plan think possible.
   Former U.S. arms control director Ralph Earle praised the
initiative but called Bush's timetable ``overly optimistic.''
Earle, who negotiated the 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty
with the Soviet Union, predicted the Vienna talks would take at
least two years to reach fruition.
   For 15 difficult years, East and West debated a cutback in
Central Europe. They gave up in despair earlier this year _
primarily because of disagreements over how many troops the Soviets
had in the region.
   Now, NATO and the Warsaw Pact are working on a larger canvas _
the vast expanse of Europe from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural
Mountains in the Soviet Union.
   Bush proposed ceilings of 275,000 troops each for the Americans
and Soviets. He didn't touch upon the problems of verification.
   In another extraordinary turnabout, the President also proposed
reductions in combat aircraft and helicopters, which had been
excluded from the Vienna talks at the insistence of some NATO
members.
   That raises a mind-boggling problem: how to tell which planes
are designed for attack and which are sheerly defensive.
   A senior U.S. official, asked about the switch, said: ``Look,
any time you change a position in a negotiation you're going to be
vulnerable to the accusation that the reasons you had for the
earlier position are now undercut.''
   But he said the reason for the initial resistance to cutting
back on planes and helicopters is that they were designed to
destroy Soviet tanks _ an area where the Soviets had a vast edge.
   Now, with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreeing to
accept equal ceilings of 20,000 tanks, the planes' mission was
dwindling, he said.
   ``We never said never on aircraft,'' the official said. ``We
said later.''
   Nonetheless, Britain and France demanded their attack planes be
excluded from the Bush proposal because they are dual-capable,
meaning they can carry both conventional and nuclear weapons.
   Another headache was posed when Gorbachev and then Bush threw
artillery pieces into the mix.
   The two sides count differently. The Soviets tend to include
smaller artillery pieces than NATO does.
   Arms negotiator Earle said he would not be surprised if
Gorbachev tried to include naval forces in the Vienna talks, too,
because there the Western alliance has an edge. That, he said,
could be an additional problem.

   Despite the weeks of political turmoil in the
People's Republic of China, a band of Peace Corps volunteers is
embarking on an intensive training program that will place corps
workers in a Communist nation for the first time.
   ``We're proceeding as planned. We're quite optimistic,'' says
James C. Flanigan, spokesman for the Peace Corps. The corps is
celebrating today with an ``oriental-style'' ceremony to mark the
beginning of the intensive study program on the American University
campus in Washington, Flanigan said.
   Guests from the Chinese Embassy are to attend, and the event is
to be filmed by Chinese television, Flanigan said. The ceremony
marks the end of a more than four-year effort, including sometimes
intense confidential negotiations, to bring the U.S. program to
China.
   ``Our presence is definitely a sign of transition in the
U.S.-China relationship. In the 1970s, we were reviled in China as
an imperialistic agency,'' Flanigan said.
   As the Chinese aspired to impress lesser-developed nations
during those years, the American volunteer agency bore the brunt of
a Chinese propaganda attack in an attempt to blunt the U.S. effort
in Asia. Radio China broadcast attacks against the Peace Corps,
condemning the workers as agents for the CIA.
   Relations improved after President Nixon's historic trip to
Beijing in 1972, but it wasn't until Election Night 1984 that the
subject of a trial run for the corps was suggested by the Chinese.
   Chinese officials had been invited to watch a broadcast of the
U.S. election returns at the Great Wall Hotel in Beijing. A Chinese
official approached an American official, saying there was interest
in the Peace Corps program.
   ``This is the first such program in a Communist country, and
we're very hopeful that it will be a relationship that is a
long-term one,'' Flanigan said.
   Although the Chinese initially asked for some 800 volunteers, it
was decided that ``the emphasis should be on quality program, over
a large number of volunteers,'' Flanigan said.
   The Chinese have requested English teachers for the trial run,
and if both sides find the two-year program satisfactory, other
types of volunteers in health, agriculture or other technical
fields might be used, the spokesman said.
   Some 23 volunteers have been chosen for the training program,
which includes three months of study in language, culture and
technical arts. By mid-August, 20 of the trainees will head for the
heart of the Middle Kingdom _ Chengdu in Sichuan province _ where
they will teach English at three colleges and two universities.
   Flanigan said the group is composed of a variety of Americans,
ranging from some Chinese-Americans to a Cuban American and even a
former college president. The spokesman noted that the program set
up to prepare for the Chinese entry was different in that the
trainees had their tutoring in America.
   Usually, the Peace Corps trains its volunteers in the host
country in order to ease their transition and better their language
skills. Flanigan noted that despite the demonstrations and
political uncertainty that has gripped China in recent weeks, the
trainees have several months to prepare, ``and by then, things may
shake down a little.''
   The Chinese are eager to have English teachers in order to help
push forward with Deng Xioping's modernization program. Flanigan
said the Corps has received no indications from China that the
program would not move forward.

   The years seem to run together for Sara Keren,
a vendor who for eight years has made a living snapping pictures of
tourists who pose on Pennsylvania Avenue next to a cutout of the
president.
   Keren, sitting on a chair next to a cardboard of President Bush,
said she sells about 10 photos a day _ a figure that has remained
constant for years. So, when told official statistics show tourism
in the nation's capital is sagging, she added with a hint of
surprise: ``I had no idea. I really haven't noticed any difference
from last year to this year. But I hardly ever do.''
   Figures compiled by the Smithsonian Institution and the National
Park Service indicate that tourism is down in Washington during the
first four months of 1989 compared with that period last year.
Officials put the blame on everything from the weather to the rise
in crime.
   Tom Mack, president of Tourmobile, the company under contract
with the federal government to conduct tours on the mall and
Arlington National Cemetery, conceded that the increased homicide
rate in the District of Columbia could be a factor. The homicide
toll stands at a record 189 so far this year, compared with 122 at
this time last year.
   ``I'd like to think all the rain we've had was the biggest
reason for the downturn, but this is not to say I'm not concerned
about the criminal behavior in Washington,'' he said. ``But I can't
see that it's any worse than say, New York or Philadelphia.''
   The Smithsonian's most popular museum, Air and Space, reported
400,000 fewer tourists from January through April, a drop of 15
percent, compared with those months last year. In all, an estimated
7.2 million visitors strolled through Smithsonian museums in the
first four months of 1989, compared with 8.2 million a year earlier.
   But officials at the Smithsonian are not panicking. The 1989
figures are higher than those registered in a similar period in
1984 through 1987.
   ``The dropoff in 1989 could just be part of the normal range,''
said Smithsonian spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas. ``A million here or
there is certainly no cause for alarm, and compared to 1987 we're
right up there.''
   Smithsonian figures show 7.9 million visitors flocked to the
institution's 14 museums in the first four months of 1984. The
figure dipped to 6.3 million in 1985, jumped to 6.8 million the
following year, then crept up to 7.1 million in 1987 before peaking
last year.
   ``Yes, 1988 was a boom year,'' said Mack. ``Remember, last year
was the hottest, warmest and driest year in recent memory.''
   Ms. St. Thomas figures the 1988 totals were helped along by the
opening of several notable exhibits, while this year's attendance
was hampered by the closing of two museums: the Castle Building and
the Freer Gallery of Art. As added evidence to support the idea
that tourism in the nation's capital is alive and well, Ms. St.
Thomas said 77 school tours were booked for the Air and Space
Museum in April of this year compared with 29 last year.
   Still, there's no arguing that the overall numbers are lower,
and not just at Smithsonian exhibits. The Park Service said there
were 59 percent fewer visitors at the Lincoln Memorial and
decreases of 13 percent at the Vietnam Memorial and 39 percent at
the Jefferson Memorial this year.
   Mack said his figures were down 2.4 percent over the first four
months of 1989 compared with last year. But, like Ms. St. Thomas,
he was hardly discouraged.
   ``That's well within the acceptable range,'' he said. ``I'm not
terribly concerned.''
   Mack cited ``abominable'' weather as the chief culprit to the
downswing.
   Records at the National Weather Service showed more than 10 more
days of rain or snow measuring more than 0.01 inch this year
compared with the first four months of 1988.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate plans to rework a $3.7 billion
domestic spending bill this week, a politically difficult act that
would take center stage except for the leadership struggle among
House Democrats.
   The spending bill took two months for the House to finish and is
under a White House veto threat because of its drug spending
proposals. Work on the measure is likely to provoke disputes over
the federal deficit, fuel House-Senate rivalries and focus
attention on 1990 politics.
   But despite those attention-grabbing elements, most eyes will
doubtless be riveted instead on the travails of House Speaker Jim
Wright. Lawmakers struggling over the bill will find themselves in
the position of vaudevillians following the animal act.
   Wright, D-Texas, is expected by many to step down this week, his
35-year congressional career sunk by ethics allegations over his
personal finances. Jockeying among Democrats hoping to move up on
the party's leadership ladder is already consuming time in the
House.
   The spending is a priority because it contains money for
programs for the 1989 fiscal year, which lasts until Sept. 30. It
includes $1.2 billion for veterans health care, benefit increases
and other Department of Veterans Affairs programs, as well as for
college student loans, foster care efforts, United Nations
peacekeeping activities, refugee assistance, and other initiatives.
   The measure contains nearly twice as much money as President
Bush sought when he sent a $2.2 billion version of the bill to
Capitol Hill in March. Bush's advisors say the legislation is too
costly, considering a federal deficit expected to reach about $160
billion this year.
   But most controversial of all is $822 million the House
shoehorned into the measure for new law enforcement officials,
additional prison cells, counseling and other anti-drug programs.
   House Democrats _ with an eye to surveys showing the public
thinks illicit drugs are America's worst problem _ argued that the
money would finance a war on drugs that Bush has merely talked
about.
   Republicans said the provision simply threw money at a problem
that is already adequately financed. The Republicans complained
that Democrats were merely trying to put them in the embarrassing
position of voting in opposition to a more muscular federal effort
against drug dealers.
   But according to congressional aides who asked to not be
identified, the Senate version of the bill will probably not
include the drug money. Lawmakers in that chamber think they have a
deal with the White House on a bill the president would sign
lacking the drug funds but containing more money than Bush has so
far supported.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., plans an effort to insert some
anti-drug spending anyway, his office said Friday.
   The Senate may also try to insert spending priorities of its own
into the bill. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., may try to find $6.6 million for a program that
subsidizes air carriers serving small communities, and $75 million
to replace a giant radio telescope that crumbled last November.
   On the other side of the Capitol, the House may consider
legislation aimed at putting conditions on a $7 billion deal for
Japan to construct a new generation fighter plane with the help of
American technology.
   The Senate approved the deal two weeks ago after voting to limit
Japan's ability to bolster its aerospace industry by using the
advanced U.S. jet engine technology.
   Last week, the House Foreign Affairs Committee voted for
procedures that would permit Congress to block technology
transfers. The House could vote on the measure Thursday.
   The agreement has run into opposition from lawmakers pointing to
the $50 billion annual trade deficit the U.S. has with Japan. They
say they would rather see Japan purchase its aircraft from the
United States than develop the FSX.
   The House also plans to work on bills encouraging television to
put guidelines on the violence it depicts, and renewing for five
years the program under which the government maintains emergency
stores of petroleum in Texas and Louisiana.

   Railroads have long been able to set their own
safety standards, and a railroad engineer doesn't even need a
driver's license, but federal authorities are rewriting the rules
of the rail.
   Ordered by Congress to take several steps to improve rail
safety, the Federal Railroad Administration already has extended
its authority over individual railroad employees, increased fines
for safety violations, required more testing and certification of
train control equipment, mandated automatic train controls on some
lines and imposed tough punishment for tampering with safety
devices.
   Most of the actions arise from the Railroad Safety Improvement
Act of 1988, which was prompted largely by the Jan. 4, 1987,
collision between an Amtrak train and three Conrail freight
locomotives at Chase, Md., that killed 16 people and hurt 175
others.
   Conrail engineer Ricky Gates, who has become a symbol for many
of the industry's problems, is serving a five-year prison term for
manslaughter after admitting he smoked marijuana shortly before the
crash and violated several safety procedures.
   Congress is working on mandatory drug-testing bills for railroad
employees, and the Supreme Court in March upheld post-accident
testing. An administration order requiring random drug testing is
being challenged in the courts.
   Still to come from the railroad administration are several other
rules related to safety. The most controversial are a national
licensing program for engineers and plans to impose federal
standards for rail-highway crossing signals.
   Federal safety officials reported last week that rail crossing
fatalities increased 10 percent last year to 689, while other
highway accidents went up less than 1 percent from 1987. Other
rail-related fatalities decreased from 616 to 564.
   The Association of American Railroads opposes new standards for
rail crossings, saying only one of 2,857 crossing accidents last
year was due to a faulty signal.
   Licensing, required in the 1988 law, has caused concern in the
industry, partly because the railroad administration has given no
hint of what it might include or how it could affect 78,000
engineers and other train crew members on the nation's nearly 500
railroads.
   The Coast Guard licenses ships' captains. Anyone who flies has
to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. And
everyone from a commercial truck driver to a kid with a moped needs
a state driver's license.
   But railroads always have been allowed to set their own
standards for training and hiring, and they like it that way.
   ``We're terribly, terribly interested, and the FRA has been
very, very closed-mouthed about this issue,'' said Jack Buckingham,
safety director for the American Association of Railroads, which
says the nation's railroads have adequate standards for engineers.
   FRA officials said the government's licensing plans will not be
disclosed until the rule is issued early next month. It will not
become law until after a comment period and public hearing.
   The rail safety act requires the agency to set minimum training
standards and to consider an applicant's automobile driving record
in issuing an engineer's license. Drunken driving convictions
within the past five years could lead to denial of an engineer's
license unless the applicant had completed a rehabilitation program.
   Buckingham said railroads follow fairly uniform standards for
hiring and training engineers and any federal licensing program
should be based on existing programs run by the largest railroads.
   Chicago Northwestern, which has about 950 engineers, will start
to train its 100th class this week, said spokesman Fred Bloedorn.
He said the five-week course includes classroom instruction on
operating rules, safety and equipment, followed by work in a
locomotive simulator.
   Burlington Northern has a simulator in Chicago that spokesman
Mike Wenninger said can make an inexperienced rider sick from the
motion. A trainee can feel the jolt of cars taking up the slack as
brakes are applied, and a movie screen shows actual track the
railroad uses, he said.
   Conrail, with 9,000 train and engine employees, makes 700,000
spot checks annually to ensure the railroad is run safely and
requires its employees to take a class on operating procedures and
pass a written exam each year, according to spokesman Don
Holloschutz.
   Tom Watts, a Union Pacific vice president, said he is concerned
that the licensing requirements meet the needs of an industry where
rail conditions vary. Much of engineers' training involves getting
to know the track they will ride, he said.
   ``We don't take a guy off the street and make him a mountain
engineer,'' Watts said.

<HEAD>Egg Industry Makes Slight Comback, but Future Still Shaky</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The egg industry is not exactly Humpty Dumpty
but it is trying to put itself back together after having a great
fall the last two years because of rising costs and declining
consumer demand.
   So far in 1989, according to the Agriculture Department, prices
are up from a year ago and profits are gradually returning to the
beleaguered egg industry. But analysts say the future could be
shaky.
   Producers have cut back laying flocks significantly to reduce
losses and help boost prices, and department economists say the
reductions have had an impact.
   In the first quarter of 1989, egg production was down 5 percent
from a year ago. The U.S. laying flock in April was down more than
3 percent, including a 5 percent reduction in the number of hens
that lay table eggs and a 4 percent increase in the flock that
produces hatching eggs.
   Wholesale prices for large eggs averaged 79 cents per dozen in
the first quarter, well above the 55 cents of January-March last
year. Although prices have dropped since peaking at 99 cents in
mid-March, they're expected to be relatively strong through the
remainder of the year.
   But a few months of profit don't necessarily put the egg
industry back on track, says economist Lee A. Christensen of the
department's Economic Research Service. One reason is the outlook
for egg consumption.
   Per capita egg consumption dropped by about five eggs last year
and is expected to decline another nine eggs to about 235 in 1989.
   Christensen, writing in a new report, said the continuing
downward trend in egg consumption can be attributed to a number of
factors, including health concerns about cholesterol and ``negative
publicity linking eggs with outbreaks of Salmonella enteritidis,''
a type of food poisoning.
   In 1988, total egg production was estimated at 5.79 billion
dozen, about the same as in 1987. But the value of production
declined 3.8 percent to $3.06 billion from $3.18 billion the year
before.
   California continued as the leading egg producer with 643
million dozen valued at $298 million, a decline of 26 million dozen
eggs and almost $10 million in value from 1987.
   Overall, the U.S. egg industry's net returns in 1988 as compiled
by the USDA agency showed the greatest losses since 1975,
Christensen reported.
   ``Financial losses forced some producers out of the egg
business,'' he said. ``While net returns are improving in 1989, the
industry faces continual adjustments associated with declining
consumer demand. Some firms will contract in size or quit the
industry. Others will expand in anticipation of long-run
opportunities.''
   Per capita egg consumption has declined steadily since the end
of World War II. But population growth and the per capita
consumption of products that contain eggs as ingredients have kept
the decline from becoming even sharper.
   Christensen said that the production of table eggs _ total
output minus eggs for hatching _ declined 8.6 percent to 4.4
billion dozen in 1988 from 4.8 billion dozen in 1960.
   During the same period, total annual egg consumption declined to
about 243 eggs per person in 1988 from 320 in 1960. That included
an increase in the per capita consumption of eggs in the form of
egg products, a rise to 46 eggs in 1988 from 29 in 1960.
   ``Egg product consumption changed little during the 1960s and
climbed only slowly through the 1970s,'' Christensen said. ``Since
1980, however, it has jumped 33 percent, reflecting expansions in
use in manufacturing a number of food products such as pasta and
cakes, and in hotel, restaurant and institutional uses.''
   Christensen examined a number of marketing possibilities that
egg people may choose to consider.
   ``More attention to all facets of marketing may offer greater
profit opportunities by transforming eggs, as much as possible,
from a commodity product to a branded, labeled premium product,''
he said. ``Industry experiences show that attention to customer
service, market research, product development, innovation and
advertising have contributed to successful development and
marketing efforts by some egg producers.''
   Christensen said a survey has shown egg size is important to
customers, along with a preference for buying eggs by the dozen
rather than weight. While the one-dozen carton was identified as
the most convenient, producers who offer split packs, a six-egg
carton and multiple dozen packs have some advantage.
   The recognition of demographic trends such as the rise in the
number of aging Americans, the increased number of women in the
work force, and the growing importance of ethnic markets are other
factors to be considered.

   Barry D. Gingell, a doctor who campaigned to
speed up the testing of experimental drugs for AIDS and to increase
access to them, has died of the disease. He was 34.
   Gingell, a Manhattan resident, died Monday at St. Vincent's

   For nearly two years, Gingell was the top medical expert for the
Gay Men's Health Crisis, a New York City service and education
organization seeking to combat the disease.
   Gingell, an internist and nutritionist, served on the National

   Gingell had been hospitalized for the last three months. He was
stricken by aqcuired immune deficiency syndrome four years ago.
   ``Drug research is going at a maddeningly slow pace,'' he told
The New York Times 15 months ago. ``Right now at least 10 to 20
drugs show promising results elsewhere in the world or in the

   Once again, George Bush was a campaigner, working
the crowds, and no matter that the hands he grasped along the rope
line weren't voters, but American priests and nuns at the Vatican,
Italian townspeople at a playground wall in Nettuno.
   The habit is unshakeable, the technique universal.
   ``God Bless America,'' sang about 120 Americans studying in Rome
after their audience with the president in a 16th century hall in
the Vatican Palace. He smilingly checked his watch as their
applause ran long. ``What a neat welcome, thank you,'' Bush told
them.
   It was that kind of Memorial Day weekend for President Bush, at
home abroad. The heavy duty of his first presidential mission to
Europe was before him in Brussels, at NATO summit talks that wound
up today. Bonn and London lie ahead, before he flies home on Friday.
   But first there was time for a hectic Roman holiday weekend, and
Bush rushed through it smiling, waving, shaking Italian hands,
American hands, leavening the formalities and conferences with
outings he clearly found fun.
   He spent an hour on Saturday with Pope John Paul II. They
exchanged the standard formal statements _ and the Bush White House
squeezed in more people than there were Vatican chairs, to make
certain the devout Roman Catholics in the presidential entourage
shared the papal greeting. Everybody sat, as ordained by protocol,
three people to two chairs toward the end of the line.
   Once, in similar audience, President Reagan had drowsed off
during a lengthy papal statement. Perhaps mindful of such risks,
the Vatican kept this one brief.
   Bush presented John Paul II a sterling silver tray engraved with
the president's name and office. Routine; nothing to rival
President Lyndon B. Johnson's present to John Paul's predecessor _
a bust of LBJ.
   The Bush gift came from the three trunkloads of presents stowed
in the White House luggage for ceremonies in four capitals, and at
the NATO summit, where leaders of 16 Atlantic allies conferred.
   Rome came first since, as Bush tritely noted, all roads lead
there. All roads were traffic jammed while he was in town, wheeling
from meeting to meal to memorial in a motorcade two dozen cars
long, with police helicopters hovering above.
   Security was tight, but not tight enough to keep youthful
rightists from blocking the motorcade for a few minutes in Nettuno,
near the World War II beachhead of Anzio. About 20 of them
pig-piled into the road ahead of the Bush caravan on the way to a
Sunday Mass at a tiny medieval church a block from the
Mediterranean Sea. It wasn't much of an episode, but the whole
cavalcade did stall for the better part of five minutes, close by
the Ghostbusters Pizzeria, while Italian police cleared the street,
arresting at least four of the demonstrators.
   The Bushes went on to church, to a Mass conducted in Italian, in
a church that seated fewer than 100 among the fading frescoes. When
the collection basket came around, Bush had a $20 bill ready. A
translator helped explain the Italian litany. No translation was
needed as the parishioners applauded, then clapped in rhythmic
unison as the Bushes left through a small door beside the altar.
   Saturday evening at the Vatican, Bush found himself ahead of
schedule, and decided he's like to make an unannounced visit to an
Italian cafe before the Italian state dinner. That was not popular
with security men, and it was scrubbed.
   But next day, Bush got his spontaneity system working. He
stopped his motorcade in Nettuno and climbed a grassy bank to shake
hands with 100 or so people at a playground wall. ``It looks like
he's running for mayor of Nettuno,'' said Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, who can sense such things, having managed Bush's
campaigns.
   Then, with 10 minutes notice, he took his helicopter out to the
USS Guadalcanal, a helicopter carrier anchored 2{ miles offshore.
``Surprise visit, Captain,'' he said, returning a salute from Capt.
John McKay of Virginia Beach, Va. That it was; when the president
and Mrs. Bush went below deck, they encountered a sailor who had
just stepped from the shower and was wearing only a towel.
   Bush flew on to Brussels and the western summit on Sunday, after
telling American diplomats in Rome that he knows what a headache a
visiting president can be.
   ``I have been on the receiving end _ when I served in China _
the receiving end of a visit from a president of the United States
and I know what it's like _ a pluperfect pain.''

   Republicans have a clear lead over the
Democrats so far in the critical contest to recruit strong
candidates for 1990 Senate races.
   Democrats control the Senate with a 55-45 majority, a narrow
enough margin to make each contested seat the object of intense
struggle.
   The Democrats' efforts to widen their majority suffered another
setback Friday when former presidential nominee Walter F. Mondale
announced he would not challenge GOP Sen. Rudy Boschwitz.
   ``It's a lot easier deciding when to get into politics as
opposed to when to leave,'' the former vice president told a news
conference that dashed the hopes of Democrats that he would take on
Boschwitz.
   ``I certainly do have a sense of relief,'' said Boschwitz, who
has raised more than $1 million for his re-election campaign and
appears unlikely to face a serious challenge.
   A poll taken for Mondale had shown him leading Boschwitz by 9
points.
   It was the second time in eight days the Democrats saw their
dreams of capturing a GOP Senate seat slip away.
   On May 18, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., announced she would
seek a third term. The senator had once said she would retire after
two terms and her announcement came after prolonged speculation
that she would stick to that plan. Kassebaum is regarded as
unbeatable.
   The year started shakily for the Republicans when Sens. Gordon
Humphrey of New Hampshire and William Armstrong of Colorado
announced they wouldn't run for re-election.
   Even without Humphrey on the ballot, the Democrats are given
little chance of breaking the Republican hold on the voters of New
Hampshire.
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell looked like the best Democratic
candidate to bid for Armstrong's seat, but he surprised Colorado
Democrats by announcing he would not run.
   By contrast with Democratic disappointments, the Republicans
have Rep. Tom Tauke, their strongest potential candidate, already
running hard against Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa.
   In addition, Rep. Claudine Schneider looks virtually certain to
challenge Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island. An
extremely popular liberal Republican with a strong environmental
record, Schneider passed up a chance to challenge Pell in 1984. But
this time she gives every sign of being ready to take on the
70-year-old chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Win or lose, Schneider is by far the best candidate the
Republicans could field.
   Another Republican woman who is strongly considering a Senate
race is Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois, who would challenge
Democratic Sen. Paul Simon.
   Martin recently formed an exploratory committee, and Republicans
hope voters became disenchanted with Simon after his unsuccessful
bid for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination.
   Democrats are still hoping that Gov. Gerald Baliles of Virginia,
whose term expires this year, will decide to challenge GOP Sen.
John Warner.
   While the Republicans can claim a few more recruitment successes
than the Democrats, they appear unlikely to field viable candidates
against such Democrats as Sens. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, Sam Nunn of Georgia, Joseph Biden of
Delaware and David Pryor of Arkansas.
   On the Republican side, safe incumbents appear to be Thad
Cochran of Mississippi, William Cohen of Maine, Pete Domenici of
New Mexico, Phil Gramm of Texas, James McClure of Idaho and Alan
Simpson of Wyoming.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle laid a wreath at the
Tomb of the Unknowns, two Soviet veterans paid their respects at
the Vietnam memorial and thousands of people flocked to the capital
to honor America's war dead.
   Almost perfect weather with clear blue skies, temperatures in
the 80s and a gentle breeze served as backdrop to the 120th
Memorial Day services at Arlington National Cemetery, where 200,000
veterans are buried _ each tombstone marked by an American flag for
the holiday.
   On a smaller scale, eight wreaths at the Vietnam memorial
honored the women who died in that conflict.
   In brief, somber ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknowns, Quayle
placed the wreath of flowers before the four graves _ each
representing unidentified casualties from World War I, World War
II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.
   The observance began with a 19-gun artillery salute. A drummer
from the U.S. Army Band sounded four muffled ruffles, followed by a
bugler blowing taps and then 30 seconds of silence.
   Addressing more than 5,000 people, many in shorts and T-shirts,
Quayle called the war dead ``our nation's true heroes, the solid
pillars upon which our freedom rests.''
   The national cemetery is the resting place for ``Americans for
whom the words duty, honor and country are not just a phrase. They
were a way of life,'' said Quayle, whose military record became the
subject of controversy last year because he had avoided serving in
the Vietnam War by joining the Indiana National Guard in the late
1960s.
   Across the Potomac River in the shadows of the Lincoln Memorial,
several thousand Vietnam veterans mingled and talked about
America's most recent war. Some have made the trip to the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial each Memorial Day since the monument, a
chevron-shaped wall with the names of 58,156 war dead and missing
in action etched in its black granite, was dedicated in 1982.
   The monument, which has become the most popular in Washington,
attracts more than 3.6 million visitors a year, according to the
National Park Service.
   This Memorial Day, the ceremony was aimed at honoring the women
who died in Vietnam. Eight wreaths were placed at locations where
the names of eight women, casualties of the war, are etched into
the wall.
   Veterans who were influential in getting the monument built,
reminded the audience that most Vietnam veterans returned from the
war zone to a country that was at best indifferent and at times
hostile.
   ``Our nation can never again abandon our soldiers,'' declared
Ronald Gibbs, a member of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund board
of directors. ``If we must send our youth off to battle, let's
stand by them to the end with moral conviction and support.''
   Among the thousands of visitors to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
on Monday were a Soviet general who fought in World War II and a
veteran of the Soviet fighting in Afghanistan.
   Lt. Gen. Vladamir Orlov, chief of a World War II veterans group
in the Soviet Union, and Mikhail Vishnyakov, a veteran of the
fighting in Afghanistan, marveled at the impact of the Vietnam
memorial.
   The two even traced some of the names, according to John
Wheeler, a Vietnam veteran who helped arrange the visit.
   The Soviet Union's military struggle in Afghanistan, from which
the country was forced to withdraw after years of fighting, has
been compared to the U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.
   The Soviet Union provided supplies and weapons to the North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.

<HEAD>Project To Encourage Transfers to Four-Year Colleges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at community and junior colleges will
be encouraged to transfer to four-year institutions under a project
directed at minority and low-income students.
   The first part of the $1.2 million, 18-month project, due to
start in September, will pair 25 two-year institutions with
four-year colleges and universities.
   The partner schools will collaborate on projects such as
redesigning courses to make credits transferable, developing
faculty exchange programs and creating pilot programs for two-year
students with potential to transfer.
   The program was announced Monday by its two sponsors, the
American Council on Education and the Ford Foundation.
   There are about 1,250 two-year community and junior colleges in
the country, many of them serving heavy concentrations of
minorities and poor students, said project director Judith Eaton,
president of the Community College of Philadelphia.
   She said the transfer rate to four-year colleges is estimated at
between 6 percent and 20 percent, though some surveys have found
that 70 percent or more of students at the two-year institutions
say when asked that they want to go on to earn a bachelor's degree.
   ``Often what passes for collaboration is simply a paper
agreement,'' said Alison Bernstein of the Ford Foundation.
``Students are always in danger of losing time and losing credit,
and taxpayers are in danger of losing money, because two- and
four-year colleges haven't come to an agreement.''
   Eaton and Bernstein said at a news conference that community
colleges grew on a wave of interest in career education in the
1970s. When enrollment leveled off in the 1980s, they said,
questions arose as to their effectiveness, particularly with regard
to minority and low-income students.
   Nearly half the nation's 2 million minority college students
attend two-year institutions. One in six students entering a
two-year college in fall 1988 was from a family with earnings under
$15,000, compared with one in 10 of the entering freshmen at
four-year institutions.
   ``We became so obsessed with access issues that we lost sight of
retention and graduation issues,'' said Robert Atwell, president of
the ACE, an umbrella group for 1,700 educational institutions and
associations. The Ford Foundation is a private philanthropic group
that sponsors research.
   Other phases of the ACE-Ford project, scheduled to follow the
partnership experiments, involve finding ways to encourage
transfers through federal policy and holding regional meetings to
discuss how different types of colleges and universities can
encourage transfers of minority and low-income students.

<HEAD>Bipartisan Agreement Ensures Aid for El Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration and Congress have
worked out a tentative agreement aimed at continuing U.S. military
aid to El Salvador while taking into account congressional concerns
about a rightist resurgence in that Central American country, U.S.
officials say.
   Much of the concern stems from a reported increase in human
rights abuses in El Salvador at a time when moderate President Jose
Napoleon Duarte is preparing to surrender power to the leader of
the rightist Arena party, Alfredo Cristiani.
   Cristiani was elected in a landslide on March 19 and will be
sworn in on Thursday, ending the rule of perhaps the most
pro-American president in the hemisphere, a man who was able to
coax billions of U.S. aid dollars from Congress but was unable to
achieve peace.
   The Bush administration fought hard to oppose moves in Congress
for sharp cutbacks in aid to El Salvador, but Democrats were able
to extract some concessions during lengthy negotiations with State
Department officials, according to congressional and administration
sources.
   Human Rights Watch, a private monitoring group, calls the
situation in El Salvador ``deeply troubling.'' But the
administration's case for continued military aid was strengthened
by what officials regard as indisputable evidence that Cuba and
Nicaragua have been increasing arms shipments to leftist guerrillas
in El Salvador.
   President Bush went public with that allegation earlier this
month but Sandinista officials in Nicaragua called his charges
``unfounded'' and ``irrational.''
   In talks with the Congress, the administration wanted an
increase to $97 million annually in military aid for the next two
fiscal years but had to settle for $85 million, the same figure as
this year.
   Congressional negotiators also wrested from the administration a
pledge to report at six-month intervals on the progress being made
in El Salvador on protection of human rights, the prosecution of
death squad members and a negotiated settlement to the country's
nine-year old civil war.
   Assuming the money is appropriated later this year, Congress
could not block military aid funds even if there is no progress on
any of these objectives.
   But if the State Department continued sending military aid in
the face of strong congressional opposition, it would put the
administration ``in an extremely difficult position,'' said one
U.S. official, asking not to be identified.
   In that circumstance, the official predicted that Congress would
``extract revenge'' on the administration once the two-year aid
cycle is up.
   Cristiani, a U.S.-educated businessman, has made a highly
favorable impression on members of Congress since his election.
   Nonetheless, there is considerable restiveness among House
Democrats about other influential Arena party chieftains who are
widely reported to have ties with rightist death squads and who
believe U.S. concerns about human rights are inhibiting the war
effort against the Marxist guerrillas.
   To charges that he is a mere front man for party factions
aligned with death squads, Cristiani says, ``There should be no
doubt that it is I who will be running the government.''
   The congressional unease also stems from what many lawmakers
regard as the meager returns from more than $3.5 billion in U.S.
aid to El Salvador since the early 1980s. El Salvador's civil war
has claimed more than 70,000 lives and there is no end in sight.
   ``El Salvador has enjoyed a free ride with the American
taxpayers footing the bill,'' says Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``By
most standards U.S. policy has failed the test.''
   Cristiani has said he will offer the rebels terms for a peace
settlement but will increase military pressure if they refuse.

   Members of a new independent labor union said
Tuesday that police arrested three of their leaders, the latest
sign the government was getting tough with non-student participants
in the pro-democracy movement.
   About 1,000 students and workers gathered outside police
headquarters, near Tiananmen Square, to protest the reported
arrests. The Public Security Bureau said it had no knowledge of the
arrests.
   Union members carried a banner reading ``do not secretly arrest
people. Let the people know.'' Worker representatives who entered
the building to ask about the three men said police refused to
acknowledge the arrests.
   Police also told them the demonstration was illegal and that
they intended to clear the area. Police with video cameras filmed
demonstrators, who said they would not leave.
   Earlier, students at the square unveiled a 33-foot-high
``Goddess of Democracy'' statue, inspiring some to pursue their
sit-in while others prepared to leave the square to seek new focus
for the 6-week-old movement.
   Zhao Pinglu, head of the Beijing Independent Workers' Union,
said police Monday grabbed one union leader, a 27-year-old official
with the national airlines, and two others, both Ministry of
Railways employees, disappeared and were assumed to have been
arrested.
   The independent trade union claims 3,000 members. It was formed
May 19 in defiance of a government ban on all but the official All
China Federation of Trade Unions.
   Party hardliners who have wrested control in a power struggle
touched off by the student protests have taken the line that the
students are well-intentioned but that non-students who are
misleading them will be punished.
   Workers who joined demonstrations or supported the movement are
being fined or having their pay docked. Others are being threatened
with losing their jobs.
   Hundreds of students from outside Beijing said they would return
home Tuesday to spread the word of the students' dramatic appeal
for a freer and more open China.
   Thousands more pledged to continue their occupation of the
square _ begun May 13 _ until China's legislature, the National
People's Congress, convenes on June 20. About 10,000 students now
are living in a squatters' camp on the vast square.
   More than 100,000 cheering supporters crammed into the central
square Monday night to see the ``Goddess of Democracy,'' based on
the Statue of Liberty in New York, being wheeled in.
   Students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts brought three
sections of the statue into the square as firecrackers burst
overhead. The statue of a woman in flowing robes holding aloft a
torch lies on a line between Mao Tse-tung's portrait on the
entrance to the Forbidden City and a monument to revolutionary
heroes on the square. The statue is made of plaster of Paris and
styrofoam.
   ``Here is a new symbol for China,'' said a worker at a machine
tool factory. ``This is even greater than your Statue of Liberty,''
another worker said to an American reporter.
   That symbol of unity came as student leaders quarreled over the
direction of their movement. Earlier, student leaders proposed that
occupation of the square end Tuesday, but were overruled by other
activists, including many from outside Beijing.
   Representatives from about 200 schools held a midnight meeting
Monday but failed to iron out differences.
   One student leader said they agreed on four demands _ that the
May 20 declaration of martial law in Beijing be rescinded, that all
troops in the Beijing suburbs be removed, that there be no
retribution against students and that the state-run press report
honestly on their movement.
   However, some argued these should be conditions for leaving the
square while others said they should be prerequisites for opening
talks with the government.
   The student leader said, ``Most people were against leaving
Tiananmen because at this point no concrete achievement has been
realized with the government.''
   The students have been holding regular protests since April 15
to demand democratic reforms and an end to corruption by officials.
   The official People's Daily prominently played a letter from
seven intellectuals recalling the tragic 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution.
   ``We ask all comrades who in those 10 year of catastrophic
terror lost loved ones, wasted their youth and suffered hardship to
call on their sense of responsibility to history and society. Warn
your sons and loved ones not to allow a repeat of this tragedy of
history.''
   Conservatives who appear to have won a power struggle over
moderates in the government continued efforts to snuff out the
democratic movement.
   Peng Zhen, former chairman of China's legislature, told a
political forum that while students' intentions were to help the
government correct mistakes, ``conspirators and bad elements'' were
manipulating the students, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   Peng, 86, was the latest member of China's old guard to back the
hard-line position of senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li
Peng.
   Li declared martial law in Beijing May 20 to try and end massive
demonstrations that drew up to 1 million people. Troops were
stopped by Beijing residents who poured into the streets to block
army trucks.
   The Communist Party's reformist chief, Zhao Ziyang, has been
fired and placed under house arrest for his sympathies with the
students, and several other liberal-leaning bureaucrats and party
functionaries are expected to be punished, according to Chinese
sources.

   Only 2 percent of the 41 million children who
ride bicycles wear helmets, and one out of seven children suffers
head injuries in cycling-related accidents, according to a
published report.
   Bicycling magazine reported in its June issue that nearly 70,000
children are treated annually for bicycle-related head trauma.
   The magazine said 16,000 children are treated annually in
emergency rooms because of a crash with a car. An estimated 40
percent of all cycling-related fatalities involve children under
age 14.
   Parents should explain the importance of a helmet to children
and take them shopping for their own, the magazine said. Decorating
helmets with cartoon stickers or choosing colorful headgear also
may encourage helmet use, it said.
   Bicycling said the three most common mistakes children make when
riding a bicycle are: entering the street without checking for
traffic, failing to stop at stop signs or traffic lights, and
swerving into traffic or not looking before moving laterally.

   The president of a federally run Indian
college was scheduled to resume his duties Tuesday after being
cleared of allegations that he showed favoritism to his daughter, a
student there.
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs announced last week that Dr. Gerald
Gipp had been cleared of any wrongdoing related to claims of
conflict of interest during his tenure at Haskell Indian Junior
College.
   Gipp will continue serve there for about a month before being
transferred to new post in Washington at his own request, according
to the Indian Affairs bureau, which operates the school.
   W. Pat Ragsdale, acting assistant secretary of the BIA, said in
a statement issued in Washington that Gipp had decided to request
reassignment because of the controversy.
   Gipp was removed temporarily from the presidency of Haskell last
fall after Don Bread, a Haskell teacher, filed a complaint. Bread
charged that Gipp had directed his assistant dean of instruction in
1987 to pressure Bread into changing a failing grade he had given
Gipp's daughter, Denise, so she could graduate that year.
   Bread's complaint said the grade later was changed to a D
without his knowledge.
   Miss Gipp later worked in the Haskell admissions and records
office, where she eventually received a $600 bonus, which also was
investigated by the BIA.
   Gipp denied any wrongdoing and said his daughter had taken part
in a special summer session offered to students who could not
graduate because they had failed a required course.
   Gipp has been working in the bureau's Washington office since he
was removed at Haskell, which serves about 800 students from tribes
throughout the country.

   With one stroke, President Bush has cut
through years of hand-wringing over Soviet troop levels.
   But problems remain because it is still difficult to determine
who has how many troops, airplanes and artillery and where they all
are.
   Even so, Bush won wide allied endorsement at the NATO summit
meeting here Monday for his four-part conventional arms reduction
proposal.
   ``I congratulate him on this far-sighted step with which he has
once more impressively affirmed the United States' leadership,''
said West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has clashed bitterly
with the United States on the issue of nuclear arms.
   Bush wants the conventional arms talks between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact in Vienna put on the fast track. In fact, he wants a
treaty signed in six to 12 months and implemented by 1993, at the
latest.
   That is faster than even some enthusiastic supporters of the
plan think possible.
   Former U.S. arms control director Ralph Earle praised the
initiative but called Bush's timetable ``overly optimistic.''
Earle, who negotiated the 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty
with the Soviet Union, predicted the Vienna talks would take at
least two years to reach fruition.
   For 15 difficult years, East and West debated a cutback in
Central Europe. They gave up in despair earlier this year _
primarily because of disagreements over how many troops the Soviets
had in the region.
   Now, NATO and the Warsaw Pact are working on a larger canvas _
the vast expanse of Europe from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural
Mountains in the Soviet Union.
   Bush proposed ceilings of 275,000 troops each for the Americans
and Soviets. He didn't touch upon the problems of verification.
   In another extraordinary turnabout, the President also proposed
reductions in combat aircraft and helicopters, which had been
excluded from the Vienna talks at the insistence of some NATO
members.
   That raises a mind-boggling problem: how to tell which planes
are designed for attack and which are sheerly defensive.
   A senior U.S. official, asked about the switch, said: ``Look,
any time you change a position in a negotiation you're going to be
vulnerable to the accusation that the reasons you had for the
earlier position are now undercut.''
   But he said the reason for the initial resistance to cutting
back on planes and helicopters is that they were designed to
destroy Soviet tanks _ an area where the Soviets had a vast edge.
   Now, with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreeing to
accept equal ceilings of 20,000 tanks, the planes' mission was
dwindling, he said.
   ``We never said never on aircraft,'' the official said. ``We
said later.''
   Nonetheless, Britain and France demanded their attack planes be
excluded from the Bush proposal because they are dual-capable,
meaning they can carry both conventional and nuclear weapons.
   Another headache was posed when Gorbachev and then Bush threw
artillery pieces into the mix.
   The two sides count differently. The Soviets tend to include
smaller artillery pieces than NATO does.
   Arms negotiator Earle said he would not be surprised if
Gorbachev tried to include naval forces in the Vienna talks, too,
because there the Western alliance has an edge. That, he said,
could be an additional problem.

   A young man described by neighbors as a
Yale graduate frustrated by unemployment stabbed his mother and
three other people to death at his home on Memorial Day,
authorities said.
   Rolando Marcello, 23, was arrested by state police after a high
speed chase that ended when the suspect left his car and jumped off
a 40-foot bridge in an attempt to elude capture, said Union County
Prosecutor John H. Stamler.
   Two of the victims were Marcello's mother, Anita Marcello, 51,
and his brother Raymond, 20, Stamler said at a news conference late
Monday.
   Two others, Nelson Paiva, 20, a family friend from neighboring
Union, and a Mark Dennis, 36, a neighbor who attempted to stop
Paiva's slaying, were also killed. All four died of multiple stab
wounds.
   Another neighbor, Richard Hartmann, was in guarded condition at
Overlook Hospital in Summit.
   Authorities said that neighbors at a holiday barbeque Monday
afternoon saw Marcello chasing Paiva with a large knife outside his
white two-story home in this suburban community about 25 miles west
of New York City.
   Janice BonGiovanni, who lives across the street in the neatly
kept neighborhood, said she first thought it was a joke when he saw
the man, who goes by the name of Rolly, wrestling on the ground
with other neighborhood men.
   ``They were on the ground. I thought they were fooling around
until I saw a knife in his hand,'' she said. ``It was a 10-inch
knife, it was like a dagger.''
   She said Marcello had Hartmann on the ground but the latter got
away. The other man, apparently Dennis, did not.
   Then ``Rolly ran into the house, came out again, opened the door
of the car and said, `What have I done, what have I done?''' she
said.
   Mrs. BonGiovanni said he then drove away in his car while
clutching a brown garbage bag.
   Marcello apparently tried to ditch the car and steal a pickup
truck but could not get it started, Stamler said. He then
succesfully stole a Volkswagen and took off heading west on Route
22.
   The high speed chase took them 20 miles to neighboring Somerset
County before Marcello abandoned his car and jumped off a highway
bridge over the Lanington River. State troopers called
reinforcements and eventually found him exhausted under a stand of
trees at about 8 p.m.
   Marcello was described as the oldest son of a family of longtime
Springfield residents originally from the Philippines.
   Neighbors said he had been depressed recently because after
graduating from Yale University with a business degree, he had been
able to work only a short time in an internship with Chemical Bank
in New York before illness forced him to drop out. The nature of
the illness was not immediately known.
   One neighbor, Steve Galluzzo, said ``the whole family was very
low key and respectful people.''
   ``I think he (Marcello) was depressed,'' he said. ``For a while
he was at top of his class in Yale but when he got out into the
business world I don't know what happened.''
   Prosecutors confirmed that Marcello had attended Yale and then
worked for a time as a commercial loan officer for Chemical Bank.
Stamler and other officials could not say if he had been working
recently.
   ``It appears that he was unhappy but I don't know if it was over
his employment,'' Stamler said.
   Mrs. BonGiovanni said his mother lived with her four sons in the
same house for about 15 years. She said the mother was a nurse at
Newark University Hospital and that the father died about 10 years
ago.
   Marcello was charged with four counts of murder and one count of
aggravated assault, Stamler said. He was being held in the Union
County Jail pending his arraignment.

<HEAD>Experts Puzzle Over Task of Making Maps Match</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is it London or Londres? Peking or Beijing?
   U.N. experts have spent 30 years trying to come up with single
spellings for geographical names worldwide, but they say trying to
make maps match may be a losing effort.
   They struggle through 3,000 different languages, including about
250 official ones, in their search for uniform names, says Canadian
Henri Dorion, chairman of the U.N. Group of Experts on Geographical
Names.
   The group held its twice-annual meeting in Geneva last week.
   Before an internationally recognized name for a town can be
adopted, a national standard must be agreed upon. That poses
problems for countries like the Soviet Union, which has about 100
languages, Dorion explains.
   He accepts that the task will occupy his grandchildrens'
generation and doubts complete standardization will ever be
achieved.
   ``We recognize that, for example, the French will continue to
call London `Londres' and we are not trying to change that, but we
would like to limit the number of different transliterations,'' he
said.
   The experts say their little-known efforts have yielded
practical benefits, especially in improving communications.
   Bunny Lewis, a British member of the group, cited a recent
example in Sudan.
   ``If you are engaged in famine relief and you have to collect
the names of the villages to distribute food and those villages are
randomly spelled, what do you do about it?
   ``The answer is that you make new maps and you arrive at a
standard way of writing all those names of villages,'' Lewis told a
news conference.
   The new Roman-script transliteration of Chinese, adopted by the
United Nations in 1977, has been the most successful, Dorion said.
   ``The Chinese system is on the way to being accepted by
everybody. Although we still see some variations such as Peking,
more and more we are seeing Beijing in everyday usage,'' he said.

   When you're George Bush and you find
yourself back at your 18th century chateau with 90 minutes to spare
before the next formal event of the 40th anniversary NATO summit,
what do you do?
   Put on a T-shirt and shorts and go jogging around the
Stuyvenberg Palace, what else?
   The American president is two weeks' shy of his 65th birthday,
but he still likes to get in a relaxing run whenever he can, and
that's what he did after returning late Monday afternoon from five
hours of talks with his counterparts from the 15 other NATO nations.
   It may have helped him work up an appetite for the evening
repast that followed at the Val Duchesse, another palatial estate
where the menu for what was described as a working dinner included:
lobster salad with sauce au corial and caviar; pigeon de Bresse en
cocotte with hearts of artichoke, and layered pastries with
strawberries and raspberries.
   The presidents presumably fared better on this score than did
their prime ministers, who canceled their own dinner at the Val
Duchesse while working into the wee hours to hammer out a
compromise on nuclear missile negotiating strategy.
   A pool of American reporters allowed in to the Val Duchesse to
witness the dinner arrivals found itself cooling its heels
beforehand at NATO headquarters while waiting for NATO escorts to
accompany them to the event in the mansion, located in a thickly
wooded park.
   The reporters, accustomed to being screened and sped on their
way to President Bush's events by Secret Service agents, found that
wasn't good enough in Brussels. As one wrote in a pool report, ``It
was explained NATO security would not allow the Secret Service to
sweep us, nor allow the U.S. press bus to enter the Val Duchesse
grounds.''
   ``The White House is not running this, NATO is,'' the advance
person explained.

   The media were not the only ones subject to stringent security
for the NATO summit.
   More than 1,300 local and state police have been pressed into
service to maintain security throughout the Belgian capital for the
two-day summit.
   As Bush and the leaders of the other 15 alliance nations arrived
at the sprawling NATO complex, a helicopter hovered overhead and
sharpshooters stood atop the low-rise, pastel-yellow building.
   For Brussels _ a city of one million that is also home for the
12-nation European Economic Community _ it's another summit,
another round of pomp and protection that is now almost commonplace
here.
   If it weren't for the odd motorcade whizzing by, the Brussels
citizenry would not know a summit was under way.
   There are no flags in the streets, no banners, no bunting and
certainly no crowds.
   In fact, when Bush and the other leaders lunched Monday with
King Baudouin, only 200 people bothered to stop in the Royal Park
to see what all those limousines were doing in front of their
monarch's downtown palace across the street.
   And what was billed as a big anti-NATO demonstration turned into
only a small scale protest outside the main NATO entrance,
punctuated by the sounds of a dozen drum-beating Buddhist monks
across the street.
   Not a year passes without Brussels hosting an EEC or NATO summit.
   On Monday, a warm and sunny day, security was tightest at the
NATO complex as the summit participants arrived in a quick
succession of limousines, accompanied by hundreds of police
outriders.
   In all, some 1,600 journalists have converged on Brussels to
cover NATO's 40th anniversary summit that is grappling with the
issue of the future of nuclear missiles in Europe.
   And while East-West issues may be on many front pages, not
everyone knows what NATO is all about.
   At the downtown hotel where the summit's main press center is
situated, an elderly tourist from Baltimore, Md., told a U.S.
embassy official, ``And I'm so delighted to hear people speak
American here.''
   Then, pointing to the official's ``NATO Summit,'' she added:
``I've seen that word NATO before. What does it mean?''

   Where else but in Southern California would a
1950s-style car wash be deemed a ``cultural landmark.''
   The car wash, plus a gas station and coffee shop, are in the way
of a developer's plans to build a mini-mall in the San Fernando
Valley suburb of Studio City.
   But when neighbors heard of plans to bulldoze the 28-year-old
car wash, which is built around three 55-foot-tall steel girders
arched in the style of an old McDonald's outlet, they fought back.
   Last week, they persuaded the city Cultural Heritage Commission
to temporarily block the development while the commission weighs
arguments that the car wash, which doesn't even have a name, forms
the ``Gateway to Studio City.''
   ``We in the valley want to retain some of our culture and
heritage,'' said Jack McGrath, a political consultant who launched
the campaign to save the car wash.
   The Arba Group of Los Angeles plans to demolish the car wash to
make way for a two-story, $15 million shopping center. Company
officials refused to comment on the protests last week.
   About 100 area residents rallied at the gas station Sunday to
protest the planned demolition.
   Others in the neighborhood aren't sure what to make of the fuss.
   ``It's not a cultural monument,'' said resident William Griffis.
``But it certainly is a handy place to get your car washed.''

   Making chocolate- or tangerine-flavored peanut
pudding was a snap, but peanut-based cheese spread was a tougher
nut to crack.
   Food scientists at the University of Georgia came up with those
examples of peanut creativity as part of a government-supported
effort to develop low-cost, high-protein foods for the Third World.
The foods also are low in saturated fat and cholesterol, qualities
that might sell them to U.S. consumers as well.
   And the taste is, well, ``quite acceptable,'' Dr. Anna A.V.
Resurreccion, associate professor of food science, said in a recent
interview. She began developing the products three years ago under
a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   For the peanut pudding, Resurreccion and her colleagues pressed
peanut kernels to remove some of the oil and ground up the
remaining material. They added hot water and a coagulating agent to
get a slab of peanut curd about the consistency of tofu. Finally,
they mixed in sweeteners and flavorings.
   The pudding contains 160 calories per serving. But it has 50
percent protein by weight _ 10 times as much as a serving of
milk-based chocolate pudding with the same number of calories.
   Making peanut-based cheese spread was more complicated. Uncooked
peanuts were chopped, soaked in warm water and dried slowly to keep
them from developing the usual flavor of roasted nuts. Then they
were ground, salted and mixed with commercially available cheese
flavoring.
   The spread has a longer shelf life and twice the protein of
dairy-based products.

   Operators of the Seabrook nuclear power
plant warmed the reactor for its first low-power testing, but
opponents planned to turn up some heat of their own with a new
round of mass protests.
   ``The confrontation must come now. It's never been more
important,'' said Paul Gunter, a founder of the Clamshell Alliance
anti-nuclear group and veteran of its first sit-in at Seabrook 13
years ago. ``Thirteen years of opposition have made the issues
crystal clear, and now is really a testing time, both for the plant
and the opposition.''
   Operators began heating the reactor Saturday in preparation for
the first atomic chain reaction, expected within seven to 10 days.
The test will be the biggest milestone yet for a plant that is a
decade behind schedule, billions of dollars over budget and a focus
of the nation's anti-nuclear movement.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Seabrook a low-power
license Friday, the day after a federal appeals court refused to
block the tests.
   Meanwhile, demonstrators have been meeting with local and state
police to make final plans for a rally Saturday and civil
disobedience Sunday. Some activists plan to try to climb fences
surrounding the plant.
   Edward Brown, president of New Hampshire Yankee, which operates
the plant, said the planned demonstration will not affect the
testing.
   But critics say the protests will be an important indicator of
the depth and perserverance of public opposition to Seabrook as the
$6 billion plant enters the last stretch of its protracted
licensing struggle.
   ``I think it's real important to show the political leadership
in this state there is real concern about this project, and they're
ignoring it at their peril _ and boy, are they ignoring it,'' said
Robert Backus, who has worked as a lawyer for 17 years for groups
opposing the plant.
   Originally planned to start producing electricity in 1979,
Seabrook overcame construction permit suspensions, job actions and
financial crises to be completed in July 1986.
   The project won NRC approval for tests on May 18, but the
commission granted a one-week stay of the license pending a federal
court review.
   Last Thursday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia declined requests to delay the tests. The
license allowing Seabrook to conduct tests at up to 5 percent of
full power was issued Friday by the NRC's Office of Nuclear Reactor
Regulation.
   The plant must win federal approval for evacuation plans for
nearby communities before it can operate commercially.
   Seabrook's opponents say the plant represents health and safety
risks for people living in crowded beaches and coastal communities
within 10 miles of the plant. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
and other foes have promised to continue their fight even if it
means going to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The water in the nuclear reactor's cooling system reached 200
degrees on Monday. The reactor must reach 557 degrees, expected to
take five days, before preparations can begin to start the nuclear
chain reaction in the 100 tons of uranium fuel.
   ``Everything's going smoothly and as planned,'' Seabrook
spokesman Ron Sher said. ``We want to conduct low-power tests as
soon as possible to make sure there are no adjustments we need to
make to the plant.''
   ``I think that most people see that the plant will be licensed,
and I think that most people agree that it's in the region's best
interests,'' said Rob Williams, another spokesman.
   But Gunter finds hope in the case of the Shoreham nuclear power
plant on New York's Long Island. Nearly four years after Shoreham
started low-power tests but before it ever operated commercially,
its owner is on the verge of signing a deal with the state to scrap
the reactor in return for guaranteed rate increases for the next
decade.
   The Clamshell Alliance, an umbrella organization for regional
anti-nuclear groups, has organized demonstrations against Seabrook
since construction began in 1976. A May 1977 protest culminated in
1,414 arrests and gained national attention for the anti-nuclear
movement.
   ``We've faced many disappointments in this struggle, and
low-power testing may be another disappointment. It will be a point
of no return for the citizenry of New England,'' Gunter said.

   The leader of an international Buddhist
community is in seclusion seeking guidance from the teachings of
his 2,500-year-old religion amid reports he has AIDS and may have
spread it among his followers.
   Church leaders refuse to confirm or deny the allegations
swirling around Osel Tendzin, a man from New Jersey who rose to
become the leader of a Buddhist community, or reports that he
refused to step down.
   The 45-year-old father of four went last fall into religious
retreat _ a traditional Buddhist practice. Meditation, he said, is
``the best medicine.''
   Tendzin has been vague about the allegations, but some Buddhists
in the 3,500-member Vajradhatu community have said he admitted in a
tape played for them that he is suffering from acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   ``Although the faults of myself and others are the cause of this
apparent confusion, this situation has provided a means for
purifying whatever negative karma has been accumulated,'' he was
reported as saying in a Jan. 17 letter to his followers.
   Church officials say he is expected to remain in retreat in the
San Diego area at least through the end of the summer.
   Tendzin is unavailable for comment, but remains in touch with
church officials indirectly, Martin Janowitz, a member of the
Vajradhatu board of directors in Halifax, Nova Scotia, said last
week.
   Tenzin's followers are uncertain what the future holds as weeks
and months go by without a word.
   One of them, John McClellan, said the group is split between
those who believe Tendzin ``acted in a way unfitting for a group
like ours, but nonetheless feel he has just made mistakes,'' and
those who think he has gone ``so far beyond any reasonable standard
of human behavior that they can no longer practice under his
direction.''
   Born Thomas Rich, Tendzin was raised in Passaic, N.J. After
dropping out of Fordham University, he met Vidyadhara, the
Venerable Chogyam Trungpa, in 1971 and became the Tibetan Buddhist
leader's top student.
   Trungpa established Vajradhatu at Boulder in the 1970s and
founded the Naropa Institute, an accredited liberal arts college
combining Eastern and Western studies. Vajradhatu's headquarters
later were moved to Halifax.
   Trungpa ``made a great leap from one culture to another,'' said
Rick Fields, former editor of a Buddhist newspaper and author of a
history of Buddhism in America. ``One of the marks of his genius
was to meet this culture on its own ground.''
   The Vajradhatu has about 3,500 members internationally,
including 800 in Boulder. It's a diverse group of mostly non-Asians
who live ``normal, family lives,'' Fields said.
   Trungpa gave Rich the Buddhist name Osel Tendzin, which
translates as ``radiant holder of the teachings,'' Janowitz said.
Before he died in 1987, Trungpa named Tendzin his successor.
   Reports of Tendzin's illness began surfacing late last year. In
a Dec. 22 story, The Daily Camera quoted sources in the Boulder
Buddhist community who said Tendzin admitted in a tape recording
that he has AIDS and may have spread the disease. The disease is
most often spread through sexual intercourse, or sharing of tainted
needles by intravenous drug abusers.
   In January, The Daily Camera reported that the Vajradhatu board
asked Tendzin to give up his duties for a year. But Tendzin
refused, saying it would ``vioilate the oath I took with my guru.''
He also indicated that meditation during his retreat may improve
his health.
   Tendzin's wife, Lila, and their four children have stayed at
their home in Halifax.
   Many church members have said they feel isolated by the lack of
communication and the refusal of church leaders to deal with the
issue. Fields said he resigned as editor of the community's
newspaper because church leaders refused to discuss the problems.
   ``Buddhism teaches compassion for all sentient human beings.
There is a feeling of wanting to help clarify the situation,''
Fields said.
   But McClellan said: ``Nobody intends to give up on the practice.
A lot of people are beginning to feel that it's time to give up on
Vajradhatu.''

   The dollar held its ground against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while share prices on the Stock Exchange plunged.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
30.79 points the previous day, shed another 83.94 points, or 0.25
percent, to finish trading at 34,076.89.
   The dollar ended trading at 143.10 yen, up 0.22 yen from
Monday's close of 142.88 yen. Opening higher at 143.75 yen, the
currency made a wild fluctuation between 142.20 yen and 144 yen.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan intervened in the market by
selling dollars to halt the currency's further rise against the
yen. The central bank declined to comment on its monetary actions.
   Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama early Tuesday told a
news conference that the yen's weakness was a reaction to President
Bush's proposal for a 20 percent U.S. troop reduction in Europe.
   Bush proposed the reduction to western leaders in response to
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's initial pledge for cuts in
the level of Warsaw Pact forces.
   Murayama also hinted at the possibility of a discount rate hike
by the central bank, which has long been expected.
   A key Bank of Japan committee is expected to meet Tuesday. Local
news reports say the central bank plans to raise the official
discount rate by 0.75 percentage points on Wednesday.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the yen's weakness on the
foreign exchange market largely discouraged Japanese investors'
buying interst.
   Yoshio Shimoyama, a dealer with Nikko Securities in Tokyo, said
market players stepped off to the sidelines as soon as the dollar
hit the morning's high of 144 yen mark.
   ``Unless the yen's movement gets stable, stock market can't
expect large gains,'' he said.
   The majority of market players avoided making major moves
Tuesday before a series of releases of U.S. economic indicators,
including the May jobless rate, to be reported Friday, he said.
   ``Players are also interested in the West German Federal bank
meeting Thursday, to see if it would make any changes in monetary
policies,'' Shimoyama said.

   Japan's central bank today announced it will raise
its official discount rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3.25
percent, reversing the easy money policy it maintained for almost a
decade.
   The decision, which clearly shows the central bank's intention
to combat inflation, will also lead to rises in interest and
lending rates from commercial banks, and housing loans starting in
mid-June.
   Effective Wednesday, the official discount rate, the Bank of
Japan's lending rate to commercial banks, rises to 3.25 percent
from the current 2.5 percent, the lowest among the Group of Seven
industrial nations, officials said.

   Four nuns who locked themselves in
a monastery infirmary eight months ago to resist liberalizations in
their austere lifestyle are frustrated at the Vatican's inaction in
resolving the dispute, supporters say.
   ``It's been a long time, too long,'' Betty Sutton, a spokeswoman
for the nuns, said Monday. ``It's tiring, but they're still hanging
in there and holding their own. They're not going to give in.''
   The four nuns and another sister barricaded themselves in the
infirmary at the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel on Oct.
4. They said they feared eviction because of their protests against
a loosening of the cloister regime.
   Sister John of the Cross, one of the nuns, left the infirmary
earlier this year because of poor health.
   The nuns are tired of waiting for the Apostolica Signatura, the
Vatican's highest court, to rule on the dispute, said Mrs. Sutton,
a private benefactor who has taken up the nuns' cause.
   ``They've kicked this thing around for almost a year now,'' she
said. ``We're going to start making some phone calls and try to
light a fire under them.''
   The Vatican has declined to comment on the case.
   Tim Manning, a spokesman for the Paterson diocese, where the
monastery is located, said church officials would allow the nuns to
remain barricaded until they hear from Rome. He said he was
surprised at the length of the dispute, but added that
disagreements within the church are studied carefully before any
resolution is reached.
   ``My understanding is that their operating procedure is very
deliberate,'' Manning said. ``When they have an answer, they'll
send it, but they don't issue progress reports.''
   The nuns are protesting the decison of their prioress, Mother
Teresa Hewitt, to introduce candy and television into the monastery.
   The former Sister John is one of two nuns whose vows have
expired during the protest. She is now known as Nicole Prescott.
The other nun, the former Sister Bernadette, is known as Lynn
Williams.
   The other nuns are Sister Philomena, Sister Teresita Romano and
Sister Maria Ercalano.

   The dollar rose in Tokyo today despite intervention
by the central bank and an increase in the bank's official discount
rate, while stock prices declined.
   The Bank of Japan announced today that it will raise its
discount rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3.25 percent, effective
Wednesday.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 143.10 yen, up 0.22
yen from Monday's closing of 142.88 yen. After opening higher at
143.75 yen, the currency fluctuated wildly between 142.20 and
144.00 yen.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan sold dollars intermittently in an
attempt to halt the U.S. currency's further rise agaisnt the yen.
The central bank sold a total of about $1 billion during the day,
they said. The bank does not normally comment on its market
interventions.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a trader with Daiwa Bank in Tokyo, said
trading today was ``very rough'' with wide fluctuations.
   ``At around noon, market players sold the dollar all at once
after a rumor that the United States might ease its monetary
policy, which participants thought would lower interst rates,'' he
said, citing the day's low of 142.20 yen.
   But he said the market generally continued to favor
dollar-buying because ``the wide interest rate gap between the
United States and Japan is still there.''
   He said the Bank of Japan's decision to raise its official
discount rate did not affect the market because it had been
expected for some time.
   Dollar-selling by some participants for profit taking also
prompted the afternoon losses, he said.
   But the dollar rose again due to a belief that the United States
was unlikely to cut its discount rate to lower the dollar, dealers
said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which lost 30.79 points on Monday, fell another 83.94 points or
0.25 percent, finishing the day at 34,076.89.
   Dealers said the index's loss was largely due to the yen's
weakness against the dollar.
   A trader with a major securities firm, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said trading was directionless due to the reluctance of
participants to make major moves because of uncertainties over the
foreign exchange market and discount rate hike.

   Ten U.S. Air Force personnel were hurt
and 22 military vehicles damaged when villagers armed with clubs
and rocks attacked a bombing range to demand the facility be
closed, officials said today.
   Up to 100 villagers stormed the Kooni range south of Seoul late
Monday to demand an end to aircraft bombing practice at the range,
said Sgt. Will Baker, an Air Force spokesman in Seoul.
   Military guards struggled with attackers who scaled fences and
attacked them with clubs and rocks, he said.
   The 10 injured Air Force men were cut or bruised by rocks and
flying glass and a Korean civilian worker was beaten by the
attackers, Air Force officials said. Most of the injuries were
minor and one airman was briefly hospitalized for injuries, they
said.
   The Air Force staff was ordered to retreat to a dormitory after
one of the attackers pulled a knife, Baker said. The attackers then
hurled rocks through windows at the Air Force personnel, he said.
   Villagers say the range plays havoc with their lives, preventing
them from working in fields during bombing practice, and they have
been demanding the facility be closed. The villagers have attacked
the range several times in recent months, but Monday's incident
appeared to be the most serious.
   They damaged and overturned trucks and other vehicles and
ransacked and looted buildings in the range's administration block,
said Baker.
   A team of 24 U.S. Air Force security police was airlifted to the
range by helicopter from Osan Air Force Base to protect the range
personnel, officials said. But the security police did not clash
with the villagers, they said.
   ``At no time did the security police engage the intruders,''
said Master Sgt. Daniel Smith of the Osan base.
   South Korean riot police reached the range about two hours after
the attack began and about 450 troopers drove the villagers out
after about an hour, police officials said. Twenty villagers were
arrested, they said.
   South Korean press reports estimated the attackers caused about
$250,000 in damages. Air Force officials said damage was extensive,
but they had no figures.
   The attack came after villagers were stopped for safety reasons
from working in fields in the outer area of the range during a
bombing practice Monday, officials said. Farmers are allowed to use
spare government land on the range.
   The attack did not appear to be related to calls by some
anti-government groups for the expulsion of U.S. forces from South
Korea. Dissidents have staged a series of protests to denounce the
United States for supporting the government of President Roh
Tae-woo.
   About 43,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea under a mutual
defense treaty against communist North Korea. The U.S. 7th Air
Force is based at Osan.

<HEAD>Hunger Strike Falters, Two Workers In Ritual Suicide Bid</HEAD>

   Scores of radical students abandoned a
five-day hunger strike today because of exhaustion, but about 60
students said they would continue the protest over the mysterious
death of a student leader.
   Police said two shipyard workers set themselves on fire in
ritual suicide bids Monday because of a labor dispute. They said
one died and the other was in critical condition.
   The two set themselves ablaze at the Daewoo Co. shipyard at Koje
Island off the south coast, where workers are demanding pay raises.
   About 60 students continued to go without food today in the
compound of Seoul's Roman Catholic Myongdong Cathederal as riot
police ringed the area but made no move to intervene.
   More than 200 other students abandoned the protest or left to
take weaker protesters home to provincial cities, leaders said.
   Student leaders said they they would not quit the hunger strike
and that they expected other students to join them. Five students
were hospitalized after collapsing during the protest.
   A government official, who declined to be named, said
authorities did not intend to intervene to stop the hunger strike
but police might reconsider if any of the hunger-strikers becomes
seriously ill.
   The cathedral, headquarters of the Catholic church in South
Korea, is regarded as a sanctuary. It is often used to stage
anti-government protests because police will not enter the compound
for fear of angering the church.
   About 300 radicals began a hunger strike at the cathedral late
Thursday to demand the government admit that police killed student
leader Lee Chol-kyu.
   Lee's body was found earlier this month in a reservoir near the
southern city of Kwangju.
   The government released a report today concluding that Lee
slipped and fell into the reservoir after fleeing from a police
road block. The death was accidental and there was no evidence of
police involvement, the report said.
   Police said Lee ran away when stopped at a roadblock outside
Kwangju.
   Dissident groups claim police tortured and killed Lee, who had
served a prison term for anti-government activities and was wanted
on charges of writing articles praising communist North Korea.
   Police said today that about 200 people were injured Monday
night in Kwangju when riot police broke up a protest march by some
5,000 protesters calling for the fall of the government.
   In the labor dispute on Koje Island, officials said Lee Sang-mo,
20, a welder, died after setting himself on fire and jumping off a
40-foot building. An unidentified worker, who set himself on fire a
few hours earlier, was in critical condition.
   Workers at the financially troubled shipyard are demanding pay
raises of 50 percent and more. Daewoo officials say large raises
are impossible because the yard is losing money due to the poor
state of the ship industry.
   Suicide is sometimes used in South Korea as a form of protest to
shame the government or employers and create martyrs.

   A young Yale graduate who authorities
say killed his mother, a brother and two others in a
machete-wielding rampage apparently was depressed over an illness
that kept him from working, neighbors said.
   Roland Marcello, 23, was arrested Monday evening as he lay
exhausted on a river bank after a car-and-foot chase that took him
20 miles from the home where his family had lived about 15 years.
   Only a day earlier, Marcello had attended his friend's first
wedding anniversary.
   ``There was no motive for what he did,'' said the friend, who
would identify himself only as Bill. ``It was obvious that he just
snapped.''
   Marcello was being held for questioning early today at
Springfield police headquarters and was expected to be arraigned
this morning, Police Chief William E. Chisholm said.
   He is charged with four counts of murder and one count of
aggravated assault and could face the death penalty, Union County
Prosecutor John H. Stamler said. The alleged murder weapon also has
been recovered, he said.
   The dead included Marcello's mother, Anita, 51, and brother,
Raymond, 20; Nelson Paiva, 20, a family friend from Union; and Mark
Dennis, 36, a neighbor who intervened in the struggle, Stamler
said. All four died of multiple stab wounds.
   Richard Hartmann, another neighbor who intervened, was in
guarded condition in a local hospital.
   The killings shattered the calm of this upper middle-class
community 25 miles southwest of New York City, where residents hold
frequent block parties and help each other in crises, and where
there hadn't been a murder since 1981.
   Police and neighbors said Marcello allegedly killed his mother
and brother at their two-story home at about 5:30 p.m.
   He then got into a dispute with Paiva shortly after the family
friend arrived at the house. He chased Paiva across the street into
a yard where neighbors, including Hartmann, were having a picnic.
   Hartmann went to help Paiva, who then ran across the yard to
Dennis' house. Dennis came out and ``the defendant turned his anger
on Mr. Dennis and stabbed him,'' Stamler said.
   Janice BonGiovanni, who lives across the street, said she first
thought it was a joke when she saw the suspect, known as Rolly,
wrestling on the ground with neighbors.
   ``They were on the ground, I thought they were fooling around
until I saw a knife in his hand,'' she said. ``It was a 10-inch
knife, it was like a dagger.''
   ``I started to walk towards him, but when I saw the size of the
knife he had in his hand I just backed off because I was terrified
by it,'' said her husband, Jerry.
   Mrs. BonGiovanni said Marcello ran back to his house, came
running out with a large, brown garbage can and took off in his car.
   ``He said `What have I done, what have I done'?'' she said.
   Marcello later ditched the car, stole another and drove west,
Stamler said.
   State police saw him speeding and chased him, apparently
believing he might have been involved in an earlier hit-and-run
accident.
   Marcello ran into a guard rail in neighboring Somerset County.
He left the car, jumped off a 40-foot highway bridge over the
Lanington River and escaped temporarily by running through the
shallow waters, Stamler said.
   Friends said Marcello was the oldest son of a family originally
from the Philippines.
   He graduated from Yale University about two years ago with a
degree in economics, according to neighbors and police. He worked
only a short time in an internship with Chemical Bank in New York
before mononucleosis forced him to drop out, neighbors said.
   ``The whole family was very low key and respectful people,''
said neighbor Steve Galluzzo.
   ``I think he was depressed,'' he said. ``For a while he was at
top of his class in Yale but when he got out into the business
world I don't know what happened.''
   Stamler said witnesses reported the family had a ``discussion''
over Marcello's unemployment earlier in the day. He declined to
speculate on a motive but said there was no evidence Marcello had
been using alcohol or drugs.
   Mrs. BonGiovanni said Anita Marcello was a nurse at Newark
University Hospital and that the boys' father died about 10 years
ago.

   Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, whose husband
has been held hostage in the Middle East since February 1988,
believes her main duty now is to survive.
   Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, 44, is being held hostage in
southern Lebanon, where he was serving as part of a United Nations
peacekeeping force. Col. Higgins, whose captors in December accused
him of spying for Israel, is one of nine Americans being held in
Lebanon.
   ``For the past 15 months, I have been seeking the answers to
questions of survival and solace at a very personal level,'' Maj.
Higgins, 38, told the Memorial Day audience Monday of about 500
persons at the Marine base south of Washington, D.C.
   Many of the base's visitors came to visit the graves of family
members. Some placed flowers on the graves and others said they
came to hear Maj. Higgins speak because they admired her courage.
   Maj. Higgins said she has drawn strength from Winston
Churchill's words on honor, courage and good sense, and from a
bracelet she wears with an inscription from the book of Hebrews
which says ``Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them;
and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the
body.''
   ``This is my shield,'' said Maj. Higgins, a Pentagon public
affairs officer.

   Following is the text of NATO's
comprehensive strategy document relating to modernization of Lance
missiles and short-range nuclear forces negotiations.
   The alliance reaffirms its position that for the forseeable
future there is no alternative to the alliance's strategy for the
prevention of war, which is a strategy of deterrence based upon an
appropriate mix of adequate and effective nuclear and conventional
forces which will continue to be kept up to date where necessary.
Where nuclear forces are concerned, land-, sea-, and air-based
systems, including ground-based missiles, in the present
circumstances and as far as can be foreseen will be needed in
Europe.
   In view of the huge superiority of the Warsaw Pact in terms of
short-range nuclear missiles, the alliance calls upon the Soviet
Union to reduce unilaterally its short-range missile systems to the
current levels within the integrated military structure.
   The alliance reaffirms that at the negotiations on conventional
stability it pursues the objectives of:
   _The establishment of a secure and stable balance of
conventional forces at lower levels;
   _The elimination of disparities prejudicial to stability and
security; and
   _The elimination as a matter of high priority of the capability
for launching surprise attack and for initiating large-scale
offensive action.
   In keeping with its arms control objectives formulated in
Reykjavik in 1987 and reaffirmed in Brussels in 1988, the alliance
states that one of its highest priorities in negotiations with the
East is reaching an agreement on conventional force reductions
which would achieve the objectives above.
   In this spirit, the allies will make every effort, as evidenced
by the outcome of the May 1989 summit, to bring negotiations to an
early and satisfactory conclusion. The United States has expressed
the hope that this could be achieved within six to 12 months. Once
implementation of such an agreement is under way, the United
States, in consultation with the allies concerned, is prepared to
enter into negotiations to achieve a partial reduction of American
and Soviet land-based nuclear missiles forces of shorter range to
equal and verifiable levels. With special reference to the Western
proposals on CFE tabled in Vienna, enhanced by the proposals by the
United Sates at the May 1989 summit, the allies concerned proceed
on the understanding that negotiated reductions leading to a level
below the existing level of their SNF missiles will not be carried
out until the results of these negotiations have been implemented.
Reductions of the Warsaw Pact SNF systems should be carried out
before that date.
   As regards the sub-strategic nuclear forces of the members of
the integrated military structure, their level and characteristics
must be such that they can perform their deterrent role in a
credible way across the required spectrum of ranges, taking into
account the threat _ both conventional and nuclear _ with which the
alliance is faced. The question of Lance will be dealt with in 1992
in the light of overall security developments. While a decision for
national authorities, the allies concerned recognize the value of
the continued funding by the United States of research and
development of a follow-on for the existing short-range missiles,
in order to preserve their options in this respect.

<DATELINE>APPLETON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Appleton simply can't escape the magic of
Harry Houdini, and local boosters hope his legacy of daring escapes
from straitjackets and handcuffs will snare outsiders to his
hometown.
   ``Houdini is our favorite son, there's no doubting that,'' said
businessman Tom Boldt, who is leading the effort to win wider
recognition for Appleton as the magician's hometown.
   Boosters have named a municipal park, an elementary school and a
cafe after Houdini, organized an annual Halloween seance to attempt
to contact his spirit, and set up walking tours and museum exhibits
to foster his memory more than 60 years after his death.
   ``We needed something to get people to stop in Appleton for a
while,'' said museum curator Christopher Miller.
   Previously, the Fox River city of 65,000 was best known as a
stopover for tourists headed to Lake Michigan's Door Peninsula, or
as the hometown of the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy, who was censured
by the Senate in the 1950s.
   ``McCarthy is really not a fun topic. But Houdini is all about
fun,'' Miller said.
   The campaign received a boost earlier this year when businessman
Sydney H. Radner, 69, of Holyoke, Mass., agreed to lease his
collection of Houdini handcuffs, personal letters, billboards,
photographs and personal letters to Miller's Outagamie County
Museum.
   Radner, a magic historian and one-time performer, collected the
artifacts from Houdini's brother, Theo Hardeen, in the 1930s and
1940s.
   Miller selected about 10 percent of Radner's collection for a
permanent two-room Houdini exhibit on the second floor of the
museum. The exhibit opened April 6.
   In a telephone interview from Massachusetts, Radner said Houdini
boostesr have shown the same flare for publicity that the late
magician had.
   ``It's hard to say what he'd be doing today if he were still
alive, but you could be darn sure he would in the top of the news
because that's the type of person he was,'' Radner said. ``Appleton
is doing just that, putting him in the top of the news again.''
   Houdini, whose real name was Erich Weiss, was born April 6,
1874, to Cecilia and Rabbi Mayer Samuel Weiss. His actual
birthplace has been disputed because an 1880 U.S. census form lists
it as Budapest, Hungary.
   Boldt, Radner and other Houdini enthusiasts have found insurance
policies and a death certificate listing Erich's birthplace as
Appleton.
   ``That's not a big thing with me,'' Boldt said. ``What is big
for me is that Houdini consistently throughout his career mentioned
Appleton as his hometown.''
   Houdini lived in Appleton until he was about 9.
   In show business, ``Houdini stayed at the top of the vaudeville
circuit for the entire time, which almost spans 30 years,'' Miller
said. ``When he died, vaudeville died.''
   Houdini died October 31, 1926 in a Detroit hospital, nine days
after he was struck in the stomach while performing in Montreal.
   The Society of American Magicians, which Houdini served as
president, the Houdini Club of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and the
Houdini Hall of Fame, which opened 18 years ago in Niagara Falls,
kept interest in the man alive.
   Boldt's family construction company received permission in 1985
to build a downtown public park and statue. Houdini Plaza centers
around an abstract six-ton statue called ``Metamorphosis,''
honoring the magician's escape feats.
   The city's efforts gained more attention in 1986 when Boldt
hosted the annual Harry Houdini Halloween Seance. Despite the
services of a professional psychic and artifacts from Radner's
collection, no one has heard from Houdini's spirit.
   But Boldt says that's far from a failure. Houdini had said that
if he died, he wanted relatives and friends to hold a seance each
Oct. 31 to prove that no such spiritual contact can be made.
   ``Every time they fail, it again proves that what Houdini was
doing was correct,'' Boldt said.

   The dollar rose in early European trading today,
but eased slightly following the Deutsche Bundesbank's announcement
of central bank intervention in the market. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said trading remained thin following
Monday's holidays in the United States and Britain.
   The West German central bank confirmed it sold dollars in the
open foreign exchange market early in the session, and said it was
joined by the Bank of Italy and the Bank of England.
   The Bank of Japan intervened in earlier Asian trading and said
it will raise its official discount rate by 0.75 percentage points
to 3.25 percent on Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.22 yen to a closing 143.10 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 143.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday's
European rates:
   _2.0105 West German marks, up from 2.0101
   _1.7570 Swiss francs, up from 1.7550
   _6.8070 French francs, up from 6.8025
   _2.2683 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2625
   _1,453 Italian lire, down from 1,454
   _1.2078 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2047
   In London, it cost $1.5655 to buy one pound, compared with
$1.5710 late Monday in Europe.
   Gold prices drifted lower in response to the dollar's continuing
strength, bullion dealers said.
   ``The market is very quiet with little investor interest,'' said
one dealer, explaining why the precious metal hadn't encountered
greater selling pressure from the dollar's buoyancy.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $362.40 a troy ounce,
down from $363.75 late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $362.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $362.35 compared with $363.35 at
midafternoon Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 43 cents to close at a bid
$362.73.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.21 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $5.27.

<HEAD>Chervov Says Moscow Studying Bush Proposals</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Summit Reaction, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet military experts are carefully analyzing
President Bush's proposals for troop cuts in Europe, a senior
military spokesman said today after Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced
plans to cut the defense budget.
   Lt. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, a member of the Soviet general staff,
made the comments to the official news agency Tass.
   He was quoted as saying that Bush's proposals to cut U.S.
conventional forces in Western Europe and reach swift East-West
agreement on even deeper cuts by 1993 ``need to be carefully
analyzed.''
   ``We have all long been waiting for the United States to answer
arms proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and other socialist
countries.
   ``Certainly, the United States could not keep silent
indefinitely,'' he was quoted as saying. ``Washington's silence was
beginning to draw criticism in many NATO capitals.''
   He noted that Bush's proposals also included combat aircraft and
helicopter reductions for the first time. Initially, the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization refused to include those weapons
categories in its proposals to the Vienna talks on reducing
conventional arms across Europe.
   Gorbachev today made no direct response to Bush's proposals in a
95-minute speech to the new Congress of People's Deputies.
   But he did acknowledge that the Soviet Union spends $118 billion
on defense, nearly four times what it officially claimed as
recently as October, and pledged spending will be reduced by $15.3
billion by the end of 1991.
   Both superpowers have now proposed specific troop and weapons
reductions, which could set the stage for detailed negotiations at
the Vienna talks rather than continued public diplomacy.
   Moscow has long concealed its true military expenditures,
complicating East-West negotiations on mutual arms reductions. In
October, the official budget for 1989 allocated $32 billion for the
military, the same figure that had been used the previous year.
   Gorbachev said military spending had been frozen in 1987-88,
suggesting that in those years the spending was around the figure
he disclosed today for current defense expenditures.

<HEAD>Richardson Visits Children's Graves After Nearly 22 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARCADIA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Richardson dropped to his knees at
the graves of his seven children, made the sign of the cross and
prayed aloud under an unrelenting afternoon sun.
   The Memorial Day graveside visit was Richardson's first since he
was convicted of killing one of the children nearly 22 years ago,
and his first since a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted and
ordered him released from prison just over a month ago. All the
children died after eating a meal laced with pesticide.
   ``Oh, my little ones are gone. I have nothing left now ...
except God to keep me going strong,'' Richardson said, using a
white hankerchief to wipe the perspiration from his neck and the
tears from his eyes.
   ``You took something I love. I never thought it was going to be
like this. No one seems to understand, but you know Lord. That's
all right. With all the agonies running up and down my spine, I
thank you anyway, Lord,'' he said, as a crowd of about 50 looked on.
   Moments later, saying Monday's memorial service at Oakridge
Cemetery had ``cleansed'' him of the past, Richardson climbed into
a limousine and headed back to comedian-activist Dick Gregory's
diet and health clinic in Fort Walton Beach.
   The 53-year-old former farm worker had been serving a life term,
which was commuted from a death sentence.
   A judge ordered Richardson freed after determining he had been
wrongfully convicted with what a state investigation found was
suppressed evidence and perjured testimony.
   His homecoming was an emotional one, with a rousing service at
the church that sits near where Richardson once lived, and where
his children ate their fatal lunch of rice and beans. Inside the
church, about 50 neighbors gathered for the afternoon service.
   Seven wreaths adorned the front of the church. Six were
decorated with pink carnations and bows in honor of Richardson's
daughters: Alice, Betty, Susie, Dorine, Dianne and Venessa. The
last, decorated in red, was for his son, James Richardson Jr.
   As Richardson entered the church, six girls and one boy sang
``Jesus Loves Me'' while staring at the man they knew only from
newspaper and television reports.
   ``It's strange to be back here, but I know God is able to do
anything,'' Richardson said.
   Gregory has said he plans to pay Richardson $1 million over the
next 10 years to counsel prisoners and give anti-drug talks to
children. Richardson said he also intends to become a leader in the
campaign against the death penalty, which he escaped only when the
U.S. Supreme Court declared then-exisiting death penalty laws
unconstitutional in the early 1970s.

<HEAD>Truitt Wants Apology; Lawyer Wants Congressional Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sailor linked by reports to the
investigation of the USS Iowa disaster says he wants an apology
from the Navy, and a congressman said he plans to inquire how
Kendall L. Truitt was implicated in the fatal blast.
   Rep. Glenn Poshard, D-Ill., said he will grant a request by the
sailor's attorney to investigate the Navy's handling of its probe
as it concerns Truitt, a 21-year-old gunner's mate 3rd class.
   ``There has been tremendous publicity impugning this young
man,'' Poshard said in a telephone interview. ``Somebody had to
give the news media this information. ... If this boy is not
guilty, how is he ever going to recover from this thing? It doesn't
seem appropriate to try someone before the facts are in or in the
press.''
   Meanwhile, Truitt, his wife, Carole, and his attorney, Ellis
Rubin of Miami, went Monday to the Norfolk Naval Base, where the
sailor collected his belongings for a transfer to Mayport, Fla.
   ``I'd like to see a formal apology _ from an identified Navy
spokesman,'' Truitt told reporters outside the gates to the base,
the Iowa's homeport. ``I'm sure this will hurt me in the future and
certainly now. Life will never be the same, I guess, but I'll try
to get it back as close as possible.''
   Accidental causes have not been ruled out in the April 19
explosion that ripped the ship's No. 2 gun turret and killed 47
men, but Navy investigators have reported finding no evidence of
mechanical or electrical problems.
   In recent weeks, news reports based on unnamed sources have said
investigators were examining the relationship between Truitt and
Gunner's Mate Clayton M. Hartwig, 25, who died in the explosion.
   Neither man has been officially named by the Navy as being under
investigation, and Truitt has repeatedly denied any involvement
with the blast.
   A report in The New York Times Monday said investigators now
feel it is unlikely Truitt set off the explosion to kill Hartwig,
who had named Truitt as beneficiary on a $100,000 life insurance
policy. But they say it is possible Hartwig may have set off the
explosion to commit suicide.
   Capt. Paul W. Hanley, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said reports
representing the Navy as accusing Truitt or Hartwig are inaccurate.
   ``I emphasize, the Navy has made no allegation, launched no
charges and done nothing to implicate anyone,'' Hanley said.
   Rubin said he was angered with the Navy for hustling his client
on and off the Iowa Monday with no opportunity to visit with
friends or pay respects to fallen comrades.
   ``On this Memorial Day, Kendall Truitt and his wife Carole came
to pay homage to his shipmates who were lost,'' Rubin said. ``He
was not able to do that.''

<HEAD>10 Inmates Kill Two Prison Guards In Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten prisoners facing charges
including murder, rape and auto theft killed two guards in a
provincial jail today, looted the prison's armory and escaped,
police reported.
   Police said escape took place at the Pampanga jail in the town
of San Fernando, about 30 miles north of Manila.
   The escapees were led by two trusties who clubbed and stabbed to
death two guards in their sleep, said Sgt. Ronnie Cunanan, a police
investigator.
   Cunanan said the two trusties, who were both awaiting trial for
murder, then took the prison keys from one guard's body and
unlocked all the jail's cells, where about 100 prisoners were held.
They then took five revolvers and four shotguns from the prison's
armory.
   The escapees also beat up a prison guard trainee before fleeing.
   Cunanan said only eight other prisoners joined the escape, while
the rest waited for police, who arrived at the jail more than four
hours later.
   Authorities have launched a manhunt for the escapees.

   A young brother and sister traveling in the
back of a rented moving truck were found dead from carbon monoxide
poisoning, and two of their siblings were hospitalized, one
critically.
   Kimberley K. Hughes, 8, and Christopher A. Hughes, 5, of Vader,
Wash., were pronounced dead Sunday at Ivinson Memorial Hospital in
Laramie, shortly after they were discovered unconscious in the
truck, officials said.
   Terry A. Hughes, 6, was in critical condition today and her
brother, Leon H. Hughes, 7, was in serious condition at Children's
Hospital in Denver, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Coroner Doug Bussell in Albany County, Wyo., said the children's
mother, Tina Hughes, was riding in the cab with her companion, Mark
McMillan. The family was moving to eastern Kansas.
   Hughes and McMillan went to check on the children early Sunday
while stopping at a gas station and couldn't wake them, Bussell
said. Autopsies showed Kimberley and Christopher died of carbon
monoxide poisoning, he said.
   The coroner said there wouldn't be an inquest into the deaths
and no charges were anticipated being filed against the adults.

<HEAD>School for Seeing Eye Dogs Celebrates 60th Birthday This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE MADER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first school for seeing eye
dogs celebrates its 60th birthday this year with its sights on
public education and expansion.
   ``Back in the '40s and '50s, the public probably knew more about
how guide dogs work than they do now,'' said Dennis J. Murphy,
president of The Seeing Eye Inc. ``It was such a new phenomenon
that people paid attention to it.''
   In 60 years, little has changed in the way the dogs are trained.
But the non-profit school has improved its breeding program and
spent money on research to improve dogs' health, Murphy said.
   ``What has changed is the need to train dogs in a little
different situations,'' he said. ``The dogs now ride on buses and
trains.''
   About 85 percent of the dogs trained by The Seeing Eye _ mainly
German shepherds and Labrador retrievers _ are born at the school's
breeding station in Mendham Township, said Doug Roberts, director
of training. A few dogs are donated.
   Over the years, breeding has reduced the size of the dogs _ from
120 pounds to 70 pounds _ as apartments and cars have gotten
smaller, Murphy said.
   Shortly after birth, the dogs are placed for a year with 275 4-H
families in New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware,
Murphy said. The dogs are taught basic obedience, given affection
and put into a variety of situations, such as car rides, Murphy
said.
   The school trains about 320 dogs each year. A kennel to be built
in the next two years will help the program expand to 400 dogs,
Murphy said.
   After 12 weeks, most of the dogs are ready to be placed with a
blind person, Roberts said. Eighteen people from throughout the
United States and Canada are brought to Morristown in northern New
Jersey for a month of instruction in dog handling.
   There is a six- to nine-month waiting list to get a dog.
Recipients usually must be at least 16 years old so they are
responsible enough to care for the dog, Murphy said.
   The cost for a first-time dog owner is $150, the same as 60
years ago, Roberts said. Owners looking for a replacement dog pay
$50.
   The Seeing Eye is one of 10 dog training schools in the United
States, says Lori Scholz, the school's spokeswoman.
   Michele T. Drolet, 35, of Morristown coordinates fund-raising
for The Seeing Eye. She is blind and has used guide dogs since 1974.
   ``It's a social icebreaker,'' Ms. Drolet says. ``With a cane
people tend to avoid you. They don't know how to talk to you.
   ``With a dog, they forget about the master and want to talk
about the dog.''

   Here is a transcript of President
Bush's news conference Tuesday at the conclusion of the NATO summit.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Good afternoon. First, I want to pay my respects to Manfred
Woerner and thank him for the way in which this meeting has been
conducted, for his thorough staff work, and for his able leadership
in the Hall.
   And I think that the successful results at this summit have
given us a double hit, both conventional forces and short-range
nuclear forces. And taken in tandem, it demonstrates the alliance's
ability to manage change to our advantage, to move beyond the era
of containment.
   Our overall aim is to overcome the division of Europe and to
forge a unity based on Western values. The starting point, of
course, is to maintain our security while seeking to lessen
tensions and adapt to changing circumstances.
   Our conventional parity initiative seeks to capitalize on the
opportunity we have, and to do so without delay. We want to finally
free Europe from the constant threat of surprise attack. We want to
free Europe from the political shadow of Soviet military power. And
we want to free Europe to become the center of cooperation, not
confrontation.
   We want to open up opportunities for greater US-European
cooperation on the other great issues of our day; for example, on
environment and regional conflicts. A reduced military presence,
when combined with a less threatening Soviet presence in Europe,
can create a stronger basis for engagement in Europe over the long
haul. America is and will remain a European power.
   Similarly, our SNF agreement demonstrates our ability to adapt
to change while remaining true to our core security principles.
We've agreed to future negotiations _ after the implementation of a
conventional forces agreement, after the implementation of the
agreement is underway _the Conventional Force Agreement. Any
negotiated SNF reductions will not be carried out until the CFE
agreement is implemented.
   And we've underscored that our objective in negotiations is to
achieve partial reductions, clearly leaving an SNF deterrent at
lower, equal and verifiable levels. Partial means partial.
   We also stressed that our strategy of deterrence requires land-,
sea- and air-based nuclear systems, including ground-based
missiles, for as far as we can foresee. And while we will not take
the modernization decision until 1992, the allies recognize the
value of continued US funding for the research and development of
the follow-on to the Lance system.
   And lastly, we are placing great emphasis on a rapid negotiated
reduction of the conventional asymmetries that threaten Europe.
Based on results in that area, we can negotiate SNF reductions as
well, while ensuring the continued presence of the nuclear
deterrent.
   And now, I would be glad to take some questions. Oh, excuse me _
we've got to start with our U.S. protocol. The overseas _ those of
you from the non-U.S. press, excuse me if I go first to the UP and
then to the AP. Helen?
   Q. Mr. President, the communique says that chemical weapons are
abhorrent, and you call for total elimination. Most people think
nuclear weapons are totally abhorrent. Why not totally eliminate
them, as your predecessor had called for?

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that the Kremlin
spends $118 billion a year for defense _ nearly four times the
previous official claim _ and promised defense cuts would help
improve people's lives.
   The Soviet president disclosed the figure in a speech to the new
Congress in which he also promised and to root out bureaucrats who
are holding back reforms and pledged an attack on the special
privileges of Soviet officials.
   He also said local elections scheduled for the fall would be
postponed until the spring to give legislators a chance to work out
changes in election laws and other key legislation.
   Gorbachev said the savings from a military budget trimmed by
more than 13 percent would be channeled into raising the standard
of living of a nation plagued by chronic shortages and shoddy goods.
   Members of the Congress of People's Deputies _ the first Soviet
legislative body chosen in contested elections in 70 years _ have
listed improving the standard of living their most pressing concern.
   ``All of our production capacities must be reoriented to produce
what the people need,'' Gorbachev said in his 95-minute address.
   He told the Congress on the fifth day of its inaugural session
that military spending would be reduced by $15.3 billion by the end
of 1991, prompting delegates to burst into applause.
   The speech was greeted coolly by one of the best-known
legislators, the immensely popular reformer Boris N. Yeltsin.
   ``I was expecting something new, something entirely and
radically new that would take into account the crisis state of
society and the (Communist) party,'' he told reporters. ``The
slogan-making system doesn't work anymore.''
   Gorbachev's speech contained no direct response to President
Bush's announcement Monday of substantial cuts in U.S. forces in
Europe and a call for swift East-West agreement on even deeper
reductions by 1993.
   But both sides have now proposed specific troop and weapons
reductions, which could set the stage for detailed negotiations at
the Vienna talks on reducing conventional arms.
   ``Today, we can ensure security by political and diplomatic
means,'' Gorbachev said, reflecting his policy of ``new political
thinking.''
   ``This makes it possible to cut down on military expenditures
... without any detriment to the defense capability of our
country.''
   The traditionally secretive Soviet government has long concealed
its true military expenditures, complicating East-West arms talks.
As recently as October, the official budget for 1989 allocated $32
billion for the military.
   Economist Leonid Abalkin, speaking to reporters after
Gorbachev's speech, said the figure represents about 9 percent of
the Soviet gross national product. The $300 billion Pentagon budget
represents about 6 percent of the U.S. gross national product.
   Asked why previous defense figures were so much lower, Abalkin
said they represented only ``what we could call the budget of the
Ministry of Defense.''
   ``This is certainly coming closer to the truth,'' said one
Western diplomat, adding that considerable analysis of the figures
would be required to determine the accuracy of the new total. The
diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Gorbachev announced plans to cut defense spending in his address
to the United Nations in December, but Western leaders had
continued to question the actual impact of the promised cuts,
noting what they regarded as unrealistic military spending figures.
   In his speech, Gorbachev said many deputies had complained that
government ministries responsible for consumer goods and
agriculture were dragging their feet on reforms, and he said the
Congress is free to question government officials about their
actions.
   ``Apparently we will have to hear at this conference a response
from our government,'' Gorbachev said in the nationally televised
report on the state of domestic and foreign affairs.
   Dressed in a dark suit and red tie, the president stood before a
giant white statue of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin facing the
2,250 deputies gathered in the Kremlin's Palace of Congress.
   ``Deputies say the ministries are restructuring very slowly, if
at all,'' Gorbachev said. ``We have to find out what is wrong.''
   Construction and planning ministries have continued to increase
investments in new equipment and machinery despite his new approach
demanding that they make better use of what they already have, he
said.
   Yeltsin signed up to address the Congress after Gorbachev's
speech. The Congress defeated Yeltsin's bid for a seat in the
smaller, full-time national legislature, or Supreme Soviet, on
Saturday.
   But on Monday, it reversed itself after tens of thousands of
people took the streets and sent angry telegrams in protest.
   Yeltsin, the 58-year-old ousted Moscow Communist Party chief,
won 90 percent of the popular vote in his election to a Moscow seat
this year.
   His crusade to end the privileges of the Communist ruling elite
and fill empty store shelves has made him a folk hero.
   At a downtown rally after a march from the Kremlin with
supporters, Yeltsin said his recovery was ``a victory by the people
over the secret apparatus.''
   In a parliamentary maneuver that had Gorbachev's blessing, a
Siberian deputy the Congress chose for the new 542-seat Supreme
Soviet offered to resign on condition Yeltsin be allowed to take
his place and the Congress agreed.
   Yeltsin also had been passed over for the vice presidency, which
went Monday to Politburo member Anatoly I. Lukyanov, a Gorbachev
confidant.

   The hunts help control the state's growing alligator population.
More than a million of the reptiles are believed to range through

   About 1,000 students and workers rallied outside
police headquarters today to protest the reported arrests of
leaders of a new independent labor union aligned with the student
pro-democracy movement.
   A Chinese source said an important Communist Party Central
Committee meeting scheduled this week was postponed because
conservatives did not have enough backing for their purge of
moderate leaders.
   Those believed to be targets of the conservatives include the
reform-minded Communist Party leader, Zhao Ziyang, who reportedly
was stripped of power last week by Premier Li Peng.
   Students occupying central Tiananmen Square continued to snub Li
and his supporters, unveiling to the cheers of tens of thousands a
33-foot replica of the Statue of Liberty.
   The ``Goddess of Democracy'' immediately drew an angry response
from Beijing authorities, who said the students' action was
illegal. They ordered the statue removed immediately.
   ``This is China, not the United States,'' the nationwide
television news quoted one unidentified person as saying. ``Even in
the United States, putting up a statue in front of the Congress
building as one pleases is not permitted.''
   Conservatives who adopted a hard-line stance toward the
pro-democracy protests have started arresting non-student
participants.
   Three union officials and 11 leaders of a motorcycle gang, which
roared through the city in support of the students, were reported
arrested.
   Zhao Pinglu, head of the Beijing Independent Workers' Union,
said one of its leaders, Shen Yinhan, a 27-year-old official with
the national airlines, was grabbed by police Monday in front of the
Beijing Hotel.
   Two other union leaders, both employees of the Ministry of
Railways, also were arrested, Zhao said.
   Li Zhihuang, wife of railway employee Qian Yiming, said her
husband's work unit claimed he was arrested by police ``to find out
about the situation at Tiananmen Square,'' where students are
continuing an 18-day sit-in for a freer society and an end to
official corruption.
   A third man, Bai Dongping, 26, was supposed to take his wife to
the hospital on Monday but did not show up, said his father. Bai
Baofa.
   ``He would never just disappear,'' his father said. ``The
government's actions are vicious.''
   About 1,000 students and workers protested outside police
headquarters near the square. One banner read, ``Do not secretly
arrest people. Let the people know.''
   Outside police headquarters, a man who identified himself as
chief of Beijing Public Security told a U.S. television crew there
that no students had been arrested. He refused comment on whether
workers were detained.
   The official told the journalists they had violated martial law,
imposed May 20 in a bid to quash the student-led movement. He said
the television crew should not talk with any Chinese in the central
Beijing area under the decree, which has been widely ignored.
   A police broadcast to the crowd said, ``You do not understand
the real situation. Beijing is in complete chaos.''
   When an officer told the crowd to disperse, they replied with
calls of ``bandit'' and ``rascal'' and ``how many people have you
arrested?'' Police with two video cameras filmed demonstrators, who
said they would not leave.
   The independent trade union, which claims 3,000 members, was
formed May 19 in defiance of a government ban on all but the
official trade union federation.
   The party hardliners who appear to have won a power struggle
occasioned by the student protests have taken the line that the
students are well-intentioned but that non-students who are
misleading them will be punished.
   Already, workers who have joined demonstrations or supported the
movement are being fined or having their pay docked. Others are
being threatened with losing their jobs.
   Several hundred student protesters from outside Beijing said
they would return home today to spread the movement's gospel. But
thousands more said they would stay in the now foul-smelling square
until the country's legislature convenes June 20.
   About 5,000 students are now living in a squatters' camp on the
square, China's symbolic center of power.
   Student leaders have continued to quarrel over the direction of
their movement. Beijing leaders had favored ending the occupation
today but were overruled by other activists, many of them from
outside the capital and relatively recent arrivals.
   Representatives from about 200 schools met early today on the
issue but failed to iron out differences.
   Chinese and diplomatic sources claim more troops are being moved
to Beijing as part of the behind-the-scenes power struggle.

   Bush: Well, the communique addresses itself to where nuclear
forces are concerned, blah-blah, land-, sea-, air-based systems,
including ground-based missiles, in the present circumstances, as
far as can be foreseen, they'll be needed in Europe. And I would
just stand by that. This is a decision that has been thoroughly
consulted with the military, and that's the way it is.
   Q: Mr. President, your spokesman said today that the formula for
short-range, negotiations on short-range nuclear missiles was a
very strong victory for the United States and the NATO alliance.
How can it be a victory for the United States without being a
defeat for Chancellor Kohl and Mr. Genscher, given that the United
States and Germany were on such opposing sides on this issue?
   Bush: Well, they strongly supported it, it's my understanding.
And I don't view it as a victory for the United States; I view it
as a victory for the alliance. So they can speak for themselves,
but I'm very pleased that it worked out and that there was alliance
harmony on this very important question.
   Yes?
   Q: Did both sides make concessions, sir?
   Bush: Well, I can only speak for the United States, and we had
certain broad parameters that _ I've addressed part _ one of them,
and that was this question of partial reduction; no ``third zero''
question. The other one was the _ agreed to begin the negotiations
on SNF, following tangible implementation. That was one of our
strong conditions, or strong negotiating points, if you will. And
then no implementation of agreed reduction on SNF forces before
completion of these reductions. So I'm very happy. But I don't _ I
want to put it this way. We're here as part of an alliance, and I
don't think we ought to have winners and losers out of a summit
that everybody concedes has been very, very unified.
   And so it's an alliance victory, or an alliance decision. And
I'm proud to have had a part in that.
   Yes.
   Q: Mr. President, all politics may be local, but hasn't the
continued insistence of the Germans been damaging to the alliance?
   Bush: Talk to the people that have been around here for a long
time, and they'll tell you that they've never seen more unity and
more upbeat feeling after a meeting.
   Q: Do you think the foreign ministers who missed dinner last
night would agree with you on that?
   Bush: No, they probably would dissent, but they went along
today, kept their eyes open. In the aisle back here. Lesley, and
then Brit. Lesley and Brit.
   Q: Mr. President, isn't it possible that you could start
negotiations on SNF missiles before the modernization decision has
been made? And do you think that's a good way to go in a
negotiation, without a commitment to upgrade these? The Soviets
say, ``Okay, if you don't have a commitment, we'll get rid of all
of them, and where's your position?''
   Bush: Well, the modernization decision doesn't need to be taken
'til '92.

   Dr. Rajko Medenica, who became a U.S. citizen last year and
continues his practice from Hilton Head Island, said he will fight
both the Geneva conviction and a 1983 Yugoslavian conviction on
similar charges.
   ``I'm ready to fight, if necessary, for the next 10 or 15
years,'' Medenica told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview from his office on Monday.
   ``But I will fight until the end because this problem, this
dispute between Yugoslavia and the University Hospital in Geneva
... concentrates now on me. I absolutely was used like a
scapegoat.''
   A Swiss jury last week found Medenica, 49, guilty of bilking
Yugoslav social security of some $560,000 while leading a clinic at
a Geneva state hospital. He was sentenced to four years in prison.
   U.S. District Judge Sol Blatt Jr. revoked Medenica's U.S.
passport before the trial, thus prohibiting the doctor from
attending. Blatt said he acted after he learned that Medenica's
patients might be in danger without the doctor's treatment.
   The Swiss government alleged Medenica was responsible for fake
billing while treating patients, including many Yugoslavs, at a
state hospital in Geneva and a private clinic from 1973 through
1981.
   In 1983, he was sentenced in absentia in Yugoslavia to 20 years
in prison on related charges.
   Medenica was released from Swiss investigative custody in 1984
after former South Carolina Gov. John West, whose daughter was
treated for throat cancer by Medenica, persuaded a judge to grant
bond. West also helped raise much of Medenica's $300,000 bail.
   Medenica said Monday that while he agreed with the bills
submitted by the hospital, the Yugoslav general consul and the
hospital arranged the billing system.
   ``All records which concern these (patients) were with the
Yugoslav General Consul. But when these problems appeared in
Switzerland, the General Consul of Yugoslavia closed his door and
left for Yugoslavia and kept all records with him,'' he said.
   The Swiss media has been highly critical of Medenica. A
front-page editorial last week in the Tribune de Geneve accused the
doctor of ``amorality'' and ``unscrupulousness.''
   ``It is catastrophic, because they are not corresponding what I
do for my patients. They never mention that the hospital got 37
million Swiss francs because of my treatments,'' he said of the
media.
   Those testifying in his behalf in Geneva included former world
heavyweight champion boxer Muhammad Ali, who has been treated by
Medenica, and West.
   Medenica received a permanent license to practice medicine in
South Carolina in 1987; the state medical licensing board was aware
of the Yugoslavian conviction and charges pending in Switzerland,
he said.

<TEXT>
   Less than a week away from its freest
elections, Communist Poland is papered with Western-style campaign
posters, and authorities are accusing the West of trying to
influence the outcome.
   The red logo of the Solidarity independent labor movement, an
illegal symbol of defiance a few short months ago, is splashed
across posters on shop windows and telephone poles from the capital
to the countryside.
   Communist-backed candidates are putting up their campaign signs,
too.
   From the hasty handout in smudgy type to the color poster of a
smiling candidate and wholesome-looking family, the free-wheeling
poster war for Sunday's vote contrasts sharply with the previously
tame trickle of strictly controlled information.
   Jaws dropped in amazement when the first streetcar rolled
through Warsaw bearing a Solidarity campaign sign with slick
graphics.
   ``This is our main chance, and we must take advantage of it,''
said Anna Dub, who heads Solidarity's publicity effort in Warsaw.
   Under a historic agreement reached last month, opposition
candidates have been allowed to run for all seats in a new, freely
elected 100-member Senate and for 35 percent of the slots in the
existing Sejm, or parliament.
   However, Solidarity had just seven weeks from the day the
government reinstated it after a seven-year ban to organize its
campaign, select candidates and publicize them.
   That campaign has taken a more rancorous tone in its last days,
with the government using the slogan ``Only opposition: that's no
proposition'' to attack Solidarity.
   ``It's beginning to get hot right now,'' Ms. Dub said. ``More
and more attacks in the press, more and more posters in the city.
But we haven't run out of our possibilities yet. And we are
prepared for the last week.''
   On Monday, the government accused the United States and other
Western nations of helping the opposition campaign. In a statement
read on state television, it appealed ``for an immediate halt of
interfering in the electoral campaign by some Western countries.''
   The Polish-American Congress, for example, says it has raised
about $200,000 nationally to support the Solidarity candidates.
   Solidarity responded today by saying that assistance received
from abroad was consistent with Polish law. It accused the
government of twisting the truth to aid its own candidates.
   ``The authors of the (government) statement are well aware of
those facts. But it's not truth that is the point of the statement,
but anti-Solidarity propaganda. They (government) want to scare
those who are undecided,'' the union said in a statement.
   The short campaign timetable had been expected to benefit the
government candidates, who had an organization in place, support of
the state-run media and money. But Solidarity moved quickly.
   Countless volunteers came forward, from squads armed with glue
and brushes placing Solidarity posters even in remote villages to
passers-by who drop off proposed slogans at the Warsaw office.
   Although there is some coverage of Solidarity candidates on
state-run television, the union's weekly television show was barred
May 23.
   Solidarity says it is relying chiefly on posters and leaflets to
publicize its candidates.
   In the capital, it had spent $126,000 going into the last week
of the campaign and planned to finish up by distributing one
leaflet for every 1.5 residents, Ms. Dub said.
   Solidarity has shown both determination and wit in championing
its candidates.
   When some Solidarity posters were torn down, the union responded
with posters in the same place reading: ``Not for tearing down.''
In Polish, that also means, ``It won't wear out.''
   The government candidates claim they have best chance to put
reforms in place. ``We have a realistic program'' and ``With us, it
is surer'' read their posters.
   However, some government candidates have chosen places for their
banners that are unlikely to inspire confidence, such as a Warsaw
renovation project unfinished for nearly a decade.
   And while Solidarity uses its trademark liberally, the Communist
Party posters often leave the candidates' affiliation hazy.
   Wojciech Szymborski, a party worker in charge of the Warsaw
campaign office, said the government wants to be ``more individual
and democratic.''
   Solidarity has suggested it is trying to confuse voters.

<HEAD>Six Arrested in Alleged Plot to Kill Lebanon's Christian Leader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A suspected Lebanese terrorist disclosed
in court today that he and five others planned to shoot down a
helicopter carrying the Lebanese Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun.
   The six were arrested in the south coast tourist resort of
Larnaca on Friday and Sunday. They were ordered held on charges of
arms possession and conspiracy to commit murder.
   The reputed plot was revealed after two Cypriot scuba divers on
Sunday came across two Soviet-made SA-7 missiles and their
launchers wrapped in watertight packages in shallow water off the
beach at Larnaca.
   ``Three of the suspects admitted in voluntary statements that
with the means at their disposal, they planned to assassinate an
Arab personality,'' police investigator Nicos Kazafaniotis told the
court.
   Kazafaniotis did not mention any names, but one of the six,
Idris Jamal Jaber, turned toward the packed journalists' gallery
and spelled out the name ``Aoun'' with his lips. He did not say it
aloud.
   Aoun had been scheduled to pass through Larnaca's airport last
week to attend an Arab League summit in Casablanca, Morocco, where
Arab leaders were discussing Lebanon's 14-year war between
Christians and Moslems.
   But Aoun, Lebanon's army commander and head of a Christian
Cabinet vying for power with a Moslem Cabinet, did not attend the
summit.
   Aoun's mostly Christian army units operate a daily helicopter
shuttle service between Larnaca and the Christian enclave northeast
of Beirut.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
other suspects also admitted they intended to shoot down Aoun's
helicopter as it was landing.
   Kazafaniotis said the launchers were found 300 yards from the
end of the main airport runway, 150 yards from the beach. The
Lebanese army helicopters land on an apron at the end of the aiport
runway.
   Kazafaniotis said police investigating the discovery picked up
two members of the group in Larnaca. They arrested the other four
in another apartment where a cache of arms was stashed.
   The police sources said the six men arrested all were Moslems
but that it was not certain their names or travel documents were
genuine.
   Last year, Omar Ahmed Hawwilo, a 28-year-old Lebanese, was
jailed for 15 years for attempting to blow up the Israeli Embassy
in Nicosia, the Cypriot capital.
   The car bomb exploded 200 yards from the heavily guarded embassy
May 11, 1988, killing the car's driver and two Cypriots. Fifteen
Cypriots were wounded.

   President Bush today hailed the
``double hit'' unity forged on nuclear and conventional arms
proposals at his first NATO summit, and asserted he would not
accept elimination of short-range nuclear missiles from Europe.
   ``There will be no third zero,'' he said in a reference to arms
control jargon for scrapping the missiles.
   ``Partial is partial,'' Bush said referring to the language of
an official NATO communique under which the alliance will negotiate
cuts in short-range missiles, but only after East-West conventional
force reductions are underway.
   ``To try to interpret it some other way misses the boat,'' Bush
said in a news conference that ended the two-day NATO summit. The
president was departing Belgium today for West Germany where the
missile question had been vehemently debated by officials seeking
immediate negotiations.
   In his news conference, the president tried to turn the tables
on Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev's publicly appealing arms
control proposals.
   He noted a large Warsaw Pact advantage in short-range nuclear
weapons in Europe, and said, ``Why don't they just unilaterally
reduce to equal numbers. Now there'd be a challenge.''
   Asked how he was faring in an international public relations war
with Gorbachev, Bush said, ``I've read who some think was winning.
That was yesterday.''
   He said he'd be willing to meet with Gorbachev later this year
if ``something constructive'' could come from such a summit.
   Bush hailed the results of the NATO meetings, saying the
``successful results at this summit have given us a double hit,
both conventional forces and short range nuclear forces.'' He said
that ``taken in tandem, it demonstrates the alliance's ability'' to
adapt to change.
   Bush opened the news conference with a statement declaring that
the alliance's ``overall aim is to overcome the division of Europe
and to forge a unity based on Western values.'' He expressed hope
that his arms proposals _ which would reduce Moscow's advantage in
European military force _ would ``finally free Europe from the
constant threat of a surprise attack and the shadow or Soviet
military power.''
   As for Gorbachev, who only hours earlier had revealed the
staggering size of the Soviet military budget at $118 billion, Bush
said ``This will help him ... This should save him a lot of money
in the long run.''
   He described the initial Soviet reaction to his conventional
force proposal as ``positive,'' then turning to aides for guidance
he added that at least ``they didn't really slam the door'' on it.
   Bush defended the carefully worded NATO compromise that calls
for negotiations to reduce short range nuclear missiles only after
an East-West agreement has been reached to reduce conventional
forces and reductions are actually underway.
   The official NATO communique represents a careful compromise
over West Germany's initial demand for negotiations soon to reduce
and perhaps eliminate the short-range missiles.
   ``There will be no third zero,'' he said, emphasizing, ``Partial
is partial.''
   As for Gorbachev, Bush said he believed the Soviet leader
``knows we've been serious'' in completing a lengthy review of
policy. Gorbachev recently proposed a large reduction in
conventional forces in Europe, where the Soviet Unmion and its
Eastern European allies maintain superiority over the West.
   The Soviet bloc also has a large advantage in short-range
nuclear missiles, according to U.S. officials, roughly 2,400 single
warhead missiles to 700 for the West.
   Bush's proposal for sharp reductions in conventional forces in
Europe won enthusiastic agreement from the allies. Bush wants these
reductions negotiated with Moscow before taking up the nuclear
missile question. NATO must decide on whether to modernize the
short-range nuclear missiles by 1992.
   The Soviet bloc has far greater numbers of soldiers and
conventional forces that the United States and NATO forces.
Grobachev has recently proposed a reduction in his side, and Bush
won NATO endorsement during the summit for his plan to reduce U.S.
and Soviet forces to equal levels.
   Bush noted that when he arrived in Brussels he was under fire
for apparently being recalcitrant in response to appealing Soviet
arms proposals. But he said he was elected president ``to do what I
think was right,'' and added, ``I think we've come up with a good
proposal here.''
   Bush said the ``successful results at this summit have given us
a double hit, both conventional forces and short range nuclear
forces, and taken in tandem it demonstrates the alliance's
ability'' to adapt to change.
   The president held out the hope of reduced tensions in which it
would be possible to ``move beyond the era of containment. Our
overall aim is to overcome the division of Europe and to forge a
unity based on western values.''
   In particular, the president told one questioner he was watching
events in Poland and said if authorities there were prepared to
embrace western values, ``we will be ready to have much better
relations.''
   Bush is planning to visit Poland later this summer.

   Here are excerpts of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's speech Tuesday to the Congress of People's Deputies, as
translated by official Radio Moscow:
   THE ECONOMY:
   Naturally we cannot expect immediate changes in the sphere of
life. We must concentrate all of our efforts and attention to, in a
very short period of time, solve the most vital problems. This is
one of the most crucial problems of the Congress and the Supreme
Soviet and the new government, the basis of perestroika in
attaining the transformations in the economic and social sphere.
The idea of working in this field is to turn the economy to the
people, to give proper conditions of living and working to the
people.
   What is the matter, why don't we feel what we have already done,
what is positive? First and foremost because the financial system
has been sort of disintegrated, we have thrown the consumer market
out of balance, creating a shortage of consumer goods.
   This panic evokes dissatisfaction among the people and in our
society.
   We are not living by our means. Our expenditures are higher than
the national income. We have a budget deficit. This is economically
impermissible.
   The rapid growth of consumer goods and services must be
improved, we must supply the people with goods commensurate with
their wages. There are other viewpoints. Some say this problem,
whether we like it or not, must be resolved by applying the market
economy. We do not share such an approach because this immediately
would destroy the entire social system and disrupt the economic
processes in the country.
   We must make full use of all resources, not only in the light,
food, and agriculture industries, but also all sectors of our
economy including engineering, heavy industry and so on, defense
industry.
   In other words, all of our productive capacity must be
reoriented to produce what the people need _ consumer goods.
   ECOLOGY:
   Life also requires a solution to ecological problems. The
situation there is very alarming. In more than 100 cities of the
country, the harmful material in the air is very dangerous. We must
take care of our water resources, the forests.
   Once more I would like to say that all our plans and drafts must
be checked for ecological purity. Also concerning the building of
canals, atomic stations, chemical enterprises, they must be checked
for ecological purity.
   MILITARY AND OTHER BUDGET CUTS:
   We will have to adopt difficult but necesary conditions. We have
to start somewhere, and some things we have to turn down. We must
strictly adhere to the rule that the volume of capital investments
must correspond to the capacities that we have, that is the
material and labor resources. Only in this way can we put an end to
the eruption of construction by the different ministries.
   Another source of resources to improve our social program is to
cut down our military expenditures, to make conversions connected
to the potential of the defense industries for civic needs. For
people who went through the difficult war, defense was of vital
interest, and our Soviet army remains important. But in the world
today there is a possibility to ensure security by political and
diplomatic means. This makes is possible to cut down military
expenditures, to have a new quality of armed forces of the
U.S.S.R., without any detriment to the defense capacity of our
country. In 1989 military expenditures were 77.3 billion rubles
($118 billion). I am announcing this real figure of military
expenditures to the Congress of People's Deputies: 77.3 billion
rubles ($118 billion) for defense. There is a proposal made to
reduce military expenditures already in 1990-1991 by 10 billion
rubles ($15.3 billion), that is by 14 percent, and for the Supreme
Soviet to work out further this complex having in mind our domestic
problems and the tasks of ensuring the defense capacity of our
country.

   And we have spelled out the procedures for negotiating on NSF _
SNF. And that will come after the agreement on the conventional
forces. And that is the important point.
   I don't believe the lament _ I know we've got a lot of experts
on this side, and I don't want to restrict my questions to those of
us like myself, who are not long-time arms control experts. But I
can tell you that most people in our country don't realize the
imbalance that exists on these conventional forces. And it is
destabilizing.
   And the question is SNF, short-range nuclear forces, where
they've got in terms of launchers _ what, 1,200, or something of
that nature, to our 88 _ why don't they just negotiate _ just
unilaterally reduce to equal numbers? Now, there'd be a good
challenge. So we've got this order set up as to how we're going to
go about it. The alliance has taken a firm position. And so I'm not
going to go into a hypothetical question of that nature.
   Q: On the question of ``partial,'' the word is underlined for
emphasis in the document. Was that done at our behest, or Mrs.
Thatcher's behest, or whose behest?
   Bush: If we can wake up Jim Baker, you'll have to ask him. But I
would simply say there was total agreement on it, and it speaks for
itself. ``Partial'' is partial. And to try to interpret it some
other way misses the boat.
   Q: Mr. President, in light of the fact that you have added
several new weapons categories to the NATO bargaining position ...
the conventional arms talks, is it realistic to suppose that these
talks may be carried out successfully in the brief period of time
that you are now asking?
   Bush: Well, the timetable _ yes, we can meet that timetable.
We've challenged the Soviets to meet us, you might say, the
Alliance. NATO is tasked to be back on September 7th, with our
internals to be farther along. And so I would certainly say yes,
let's do that. We all remember September 7th, don't we?
   Q: Mr. President, you've said that the modernization decision
has been put off until 1992. But you have a commitment to keep the
weapons systems up-to-date. When changes can be made?
   Bush: Not before 1992.
   Q: Mr. President, you've said that your efforts here are not a
public relations battle with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. But
if this were a battle, who's winning _ yourself or Mr. Gorbachev?
   Bush: Too hypothetical, Ellen, too hypothetical. I've read who
some think is winning, but that was yesterday.
   Q: Do you think that the hammering about your alleged lack of
leadership in the United States should quiet down now as a result
of your performance here?
   Bush: I haven't felt under siege in the United States, because
I've known exactly what we wanted to do. And I made statements to
that effect earlier on, that we were going to have a review and
then have proposals. And we did exactly that. So I will concede
I've read such reports, but they haven't troubled me any.

   A U.S. Marine assigned to the American Embassy in
Kuwait drowned in the embassy swimming pool after he hit his head
while swimming, an embassy spokesman said today.
   ``The sailor ... apparently struck his head on the side of the
pool and lost consciousness. He was discovered on the bottom of the
pool,'' said the spokesman, who could not be identified under
embassy rules.
   The incident occurred Thursday.
   The Marine was pronounced dead on arrival at Amir Hospital,
Kuwait's main medical facility, said the spokesman. He said the
Marine's name was being withheld pending notification of his family.
   The Kuwaiti daily newspaper al-Watan reported that the Marine
was thrown into the pool by a group of colleagues during a
children's party at the embassy.
   Al-Watan said other Marines were called back to the pool by a
child who said the man could not swim.

still dying inside. A little each day, they're dying inside,'' said
Vietnam veteran John Stephens, who attended a memorial service in
Cleveland.
   Americans also took advantage of generally pleasant weather to
celebrate the traditional start of the summer season at parades,
parks, beaches and festivals. An estimated 500,000 people jammed
Los Angeles County beaches, while officials at ``A Taste of
Cincinnati'' reported some 450,000 people attended the three-day
food festival that ended Monday.
   The 47 sailors who died April 19 in an explosion inside one of
the USS Iowa's huge gun turrets were among the honored dead.
President Bush had designated Memorial Day as a national day of
remembrance for the sailors.
   Robert Gedeon prepared a special tribute by placing 47 U.S.
flags on his front lawn in suburban Cleveland.
   ``I always saw Memorial Day as a somber day, but I can't really
describe how bad I feel,'' said Gedeon, who lost his son, Robert
James Gedeon III, in the tragedy. ``It's never going to be the same
around here. Our family is devastated.''
   Emma Bosch, the guest of honor at a parade in New York City,
remembered the 21-year-old son she lost in the Korean War.
   ``I'm proud to be here. I wouldn't miss it. My son is gone 37
years and I've never missed a Memorial Day since I lost him,'' she
said.
   In Beaufort, S.C., Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis placed a
wreath at the graves of 19 Black union soldiers missing in action
since 1863.
   ``The black soldiers of the Massachusetts 54th and 55th
regiments were fighting for their own liberty, to grasp their own
freedom and to ensure both for others of their own race,'' Dukakis
told a crowd of about 4,000.
   The remains of the soldiers, some of whom were from a North
Carolina regiment, were unearthed during road construction two
years ago.
   Veterans in Philadelphia used paint thinner and scrapers to
remove white paint vandals had splashed on the city's Vietnam
Veterans Memorial. Most of the paint was removed before 150 people
gathered for a memorial service.
   ``I know 18 of the guys on these walls _ 18 of them,'' said
Vietnam veteran Buddy Schriver, 50. ``One of them was my next-door
neighbor. You want heroes, here they are.''
   In a brief ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, a 20-member
military honor guard laid a wreath at the grave of President
Kennedy to mark what would have been his 72nd birthday. In Boston,
the flag flew at half staff at the John F. Kennedy Library.
   In Chicago, more than 100 people gathered at a downtown fountain
dedicated to Vietnam veterans and tossed red and white carnations
into the water. At Fort Sheridan, an Army base north of Chicago,
cannons roared a 21-gun salute; widows, families, soldiers and
veterans laid chrysanthemums and roses along the rows of white
crosses in the cemetery.
   For many, the holiday also was a time for relaxation.
   At Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevadas, every
campground and parking space was filled and some arriving motorists
found themselves with a two-hour wait.
   Elsewhere, celebrants packed the Jambalaya Jam festival in
Philadelphia and 700 cyclists participated in the 23rd Annual
Moline Criterium bicycle races in northwestern Illinois.
   While much of the nation enjoyed fair weather, more than 12
inches of snow fell Sunday and Monday at Great Falls in central
Montana.

   Q: Gorbachev has, apparently for the first time, revealed
specific defense budget figures in Moscow today. He also says he
proposes to cut defense spending by 14 percent over 1990-91. That's
equal to about $17.3 billion. Is that a lot? Is that meaningful?
What do you think about it?
   Bush: Well, this'll help him, this proposal. If he hits our bid,
that should save him a lot of money in the long run, because he has
a disproportionate number of conventional forces. And therein, as
you know, that's where a lot of the expense for defense comes from.
So I don't know, but it sounds like a substantial number to me. But
again, I hadn't seen that.
   I will say this, for those who may wonder what the Soviet
reaction has been. And it's very preliminary, but the initial
contact with our embassy in Moscow was _ I would put fairly
positive. Brent, is that about right?
   Brent Scowcroft (National security adviser): Cautious.
   Bush: Cautious, but wearily (sic) leaning on the side of
interpreting as saying it's positive. In other words, they didn't
really slam the door and come in on a negative vein.
   Q: On that point, Mr. President, wouldn't it seem that if you
want to strike this agreement within even as early as six months,
that there would be a summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev before the
end of the year?
   Bush: Well, again, I've _ if there was something constructive to
come out of such a meeting, I would certainly be prepared to meet.
And I believe that Secretary Baker has conveyed that to Minister
Shevardnadze.
   Q: Has Mr. Gorbachev responded to your letter of Sunday?
   Bush: No, sir.
   Q: Mr. Bush, you used strong language yesterday about leading
the alliance and leading the world, the free world. That wasn't
your term, but did you feel it was important, if not for yourself,
then for the alliance, for the United States, to assert yourself in
a strong way at this particular summit _ at this time?
   Bush: Yes, I think it is highly important that the United States
to be seen as fully engaged, trying to come up with creative
proposals, and fulfilling its historic leadership responsibilities.
I would like to put it in terms of alliance unity, though, and what
_ all these decisions. There's plenty of room for credit out there,
and I would insist that it's an alliance _ to the degree we got
unanimity, an alliance victory.
   Q: Mr. President, the stress you put on the speed of
negotiations, six months to a year, and a decision can wait till
'92 on ... modernization, are there some progress points, if there
are no negotiations, or progress in the negotiations within a year,
do we re-examine the 1992 deadline?
   Bush: I _ to be honest with you, I don't know the answer to that
question. I expect _ I expect _ huh?
   ... But my own personal view would be that if it became _ if
there were some dramatic change somewhere that changed the thesises
that underline this agreement, that we'd want to review things. But
I'm not predicting that. I want to see it go forward.
   Q: Following ``tangible implementation'' _ that's being read as
obviously not complete implementation. Could you tell us how far
``tangible'' is?
   Bush: No, I can't tell you how far it is. But it has to be so
that you and I would look at it and we'd both agree that there had
been sincere implementation.
   Q: Mr. President, in the comprehensive context, you state that
ground-based missiles will be needed as far as can be foreseen.
Now, even though the modernization decision has been put off, is
there any alternative to modernizing this missile?
   Bush: Is there any alternative to modernizing it? We will cross
that bridge in 1992.
   Q: As you know, Mr. Gorbachev is coming to Bonn soon, and his
operative style has been to try to up the ante when the U.S. makes
a proposal. On your conventional arms proposal, do you think you've
gone down as far as the West can safely go in reducing conventional
forces? And can you go no further than what you proposed yesterday?
   Bush: I see no reason about talking about further cuts and
further reductions when we have just tabled a sound proposal that
addresses ourselves to this enormous imbalance. So I just would
defer on that.
   Q: Mr. President, you were criticized early on for a slow start.
Now this proposal is being described as bold; you yourself said
``revolutionary.'' I wonder if there's any element of ``I told you
so'' in your attitude now to the reaction to this proposal.
   Bush: Not really. Not really. No, this is _ I'm not going to get
into that game with Congress or anyone else.
   Q: Mr. President, looking ahead, what impact do you think your
proposals will have on U.S.-Soviet relations, and specifically on
strategic arms talks?
   Bush: I _ I hope that they have a _ that these proposals have an
ameliorating effect, that things will get only better. I think it's
a serious proposal. I think they see a solid, united alliance, and
that is important in this. And so I would hope that it would have a
good effect on whatever follows on _ in strategic arms reduction
talks follow on.
   I have never doubted _ I've never questioned whether Gorbachev
knew that we were serious and wanted to move forward with him. I've
read speculation on this, but I have reason to believe that he
knows that we have been serious, taking our time to formulate
proposals. I do think that this one will be tangible evidence of
this.
   And so I hope it would lead to _ if a conventional forces talks
can be catalytic for strategic talks, so be it. But I hope that the
seriousness of all of this and the unity of the alliance will be
persuasive to him, to make him know that we do want to go forward.

<HEAD>City to Fight Pipeline Return</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few dozen people ended nearly a
week in exile and returned to a neighborhood devastated by a
pipeline explosion, while the city promised a court battle to shut
down the line.
   About 30 of the approximately 170 families evacuated received
permission to return home Monday, police Officer John Montecino
said. By late Monday, only 13 of the 30 families returned to the
area, walking past signs that read: ``Enter at Your Own Risk, City
of San Bernardino.''
   City Attorney James Penman said the city would go to San
Bernardino Superior Court today, seeking a temporary restraining
order to prevent the 14-inch line from reopening.
   However, it's unclear whether the court would have jurisdiction,
he said, because several federal agencies are responsible for
monitoring the line.
   Thursday's explosion killed two people, damaged or destroyed 15
homes and forced 270 people to flee.
   The blast came after pipeline owners had declared the line safe,
despite its position directly under the site of a May 12 train
derailment that killed four and demolished a row of houses.
   Investigators are focusing on the possibility that the train
wreck damaged the pressurized line operated by locally based Calnev
Pipe Line Co.
   Angry city officials have challenged the company, hoping to get
the line routed away from houses.
   But over the weekend, Calnev's parent company announced it will
rebuild the damaged pipeline in the same location, using insulated,
safety-reinforced pipe.
   A two-hour discussion of the matter was held Monday between
representatives of the parent firm, Chicago-based GATX Terminals
Inc., along with Southern Pacific railroad officials and city
negotiators, Penman said. More talks were scheduled today, he added.
   ``We basically explained that we want the line moved west of the
railroad tracks'' and away from the houses that were destroyed or
endangered, Penman said.
   The pipeline owners have argued the move would keep the pipeline
shut down for too long.
   ``The pipeline is very critical to the national defense
system,'' said GATX President Robert Claypoole, noting that the
line supplies Air Force bases in California and Nevada.
   U.S. District Judge David Williams has signed a temporary
restraining order barring the city from interfering with repair or
replacement of the line, which moves gasoline, diesel and jet fuel
to southern Nevada.

<TEXT>
   Vietnamese officials have demanded that
an American doctor pay them $130,000 before vaccinating Amerasian
children in Vietnam, the doctor said today.
   Dr. Charles Mitchell of Maui, Hawaii, said the Vietnamese
government backed off an earlier agreement to let him treat the
children of U.S. servicemen and Vietnamese mothers in Ho Chi Minh
City.
   Mitchell is the medical director of FACES, a private
Hawaii-based organization dedicated to helping homeless Amerasians
in Vietnam and speeding their resettlement in the United States.
Earlier this year, FACES opened a shelter for Vietnamese-American
children in Ho Chi Minh City.
   Mitchell said that in March he vaccinated 41 Amerasian children
in the city, which formerly was known as Saigon. At the time, Tran
Van Nhiem, of Vietnam's Department of Labor, Social Welfare and
Disabled Veterans, gave Mitchell written authorization to continue
the program.
   But when Mitchell returned two weeks ago, Nhiem demanded
$130,000 to build a children's shelter, Mitchell said in an
interview in Bangkok. Nhiem offered no explanation for his change
of mind, Mitchell said.
   Mitchell said he was uncertain where his program stood but he
would return in a few months to try to pursue the work.

<TEXT>
   Traffic accidents over the long Memorial Day
weekend claimed the lives of more than 400 people, according to
unofficial reports from police throughout the nation.
   The National Safety Council had estimated that between 370 and
470 people would be killed on the nation's streets and highways
over the three-day weekend.
   The holiday travel period began officially at 6 p.m. local time
Friday and ended at midnight local time Monday.
   During that period, 415 people were reported killed in traffic
accidents.
   The highest state toll was reported in California, where 44
people lost their lives. Another 30 fatalities were reported in
Florida, followed by 29 in Ohio and 25 in Texas.
   Five states reported no fatalities. They were: Alaska, Delaware,
Maine, North Dakota and South Dakota.
   Last year, there were 404 traffic fatalities during the Memorial
Day weekend. The Memorial Day record was set in 1968 when 629
people were killed over a four-day weekend. The three-day record of
597 was set in 1969.
   Although gasoline prices have risen dramatically nationwide in
the the past two months, the safety council said it was unable to
say whether that kept more people off the highways.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers and
allied Lebanese militiamen today killed a Palestinian guerrilla who
was trying to slip into Israel from southern Lebanon, the army said.
   Also today, Israel radio reported that students from a Jewish
study center were involved in a West Bank rampage in which a
Palestinian girl died.
   The girl was the 500th Palestinian to die since the uprising
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip began on
Dec. 7, 1987. Twenty-two Israelis have died.
   In the Jewish settlement of Ariel, authorities announced that
Palestinians who work in the settlement will have to wear tags
identifying them as ``foreign workers.''
   About 400 Palestinians work in Ariel, a settlement of more than
8,000 Israelis. The Palestinians are mainly residents of villages
in the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since its
capture from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
   In today's clash in south Lebanon, an Israeli army official said
a guerrilla dressed in military camouflage was spotted east of the
town of Marjayoun. Army sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the victim was a Palestinian trying to infiltrate
Israel.
   The man was wounded in an exchange of fire with the joint patrol
of Israeli soldiers and Israeli-backed militiamen of the South
Lebanon army, then killed by the militiamen, said the official, who
cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   On Sunday, two guerrillas were killed and two wounded and
captured in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southern
Lebanon after several Katyusha rockets were fired into the Israeli
border town of Metulla. An infant was slightly wounded in the
rocket attack.
   The security zone was set up by Israel in 1985 to protect its
northern frontier.
   Also today, a Palestinian man was reported killed in the
occupied West Bank, but there were conflicting reports about his
death.
   The family of the victim, 25-year-old Issa Qudeh of the West
Bank village of Tell, told a Nablus hospital late Monday that he
was shot. But residents of the village said Qudeh died in a fall
from his tractor.
   In the West Bank village of Kifil Harith, villagers said about
30 Jewish settlers went on a rampage Monday that ended in the
shooting death of a teen-age Palestinian girl. The victim, Ibtisam
Abdel Rahim Bozieh, was initially described as being 16, but her
family said she was 13.
   Israel radio said the assault apparently was carried out by
students from a Jewish study center who claimed they were stoned
when they tried to visit the Tomb of Joshua, a site in the village
holy to Jews and Moslems.
   Police officials at the Nablus police station declined comment.
No arrests have been announced.
   The girl's mother, Samia Bozieh, told The Associated Press her
daughter was alone in a front room when the shooting began. The
two-story house is about 30 yards from the tomb.
   ``We heard some shots,'' Mrs. Bozieh said. She said her daughter
said ``Mommy I'm shot here'' and clutched her chest before falling
to the floor.
   Villagers said some Jewish settlers fired wildly in the air with
automatic rifles. Two other villagers were wounded and several
animals also were shot, they said.
   The villagers also said the raiders threw firebombs, burning
wheat fields and olive groves and damaging two houses.
   The rampage in Kifil Harith was the latest in a series of
retaliatory actions by settlers for stonings or firebombings of
Israel-owned cars.

   A World War II conscientious objector who
spent the war in a ``human guinea pig unit'' aiding medical
research plans to donate $1 million to further the study of peace.
   Peter D. Watson, 64, a retired Vermont real estate broker, wants
the money to be used to establish a center for peace studies at the
University of Rochester, at whose medical school he volunteered
during the war.
   ``We have plenty of places like West Point and Annapolis where
war is promoted,'' Watson told the Democrat and Chronicle of
Rochester on Monday. ``We need a place where we can work on
eliminating war.''
   University spokesman Robert Kraus said an announcement about how
the donation would be used would be made in a few weeks.
   The center, he said, would be used mainly for research and could
mean new courses for undergraduates. Conferences and invitations to
visiting scholars are also possible.
   The university must raise an additional $5 million from
foundations or other sources to receive the full $1 million
donation.
   Watson's experiences in Civilian Public Service Unit 115-R (for
Rochester) were on his mind this Memorial Day weekend as he played
host to a group of fellow veterans from the volunteer human
experimentation program.
   Seven of the 15 living members of the guinea pig unit gathered
at Watson's home in Greensboro, Vt., where he said they they
reminisced about and reaffirmed their decision to serve both
country and conscience through medical research.

<HEAD>Iranian Rebels on Alert After Khomeini Illness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian rebels in Iraq were put on alert
following reports that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's health was
deteriorating, rebel leaders said today.
   Hussein Mehdavi, a senior official of the Mujahedeen Khalq, or
People's Holy Warriors group, told The Associated Press the
movement's military force, the National Liberation Army of Iran,
went on alert Sunday.
   ``The NLA is in a state of military vigilance and will respond
to any new situation that arises from Khomeini's death,'' he said
in an interview at the Mujahedeen's headquarters in the Iraqi
capital.
   The rebels claimed Monday that Khomeini, 86, suffered a heart
attack Saturday while recovering from surgery to stop intestinal
bleeding.
   Tehran Television said Monday that Iran's revolutionary
patriarch suffered a ``mild heart complication'' over the weekend
but was fine and was recovering well from the surgery he underwent
May 23.
   The television report gave no details of the cardiac problem but
said the condition had been ``relieved.''
   Khomeini suffered a heart attack in 1980 and is reported to have
had another one in 1986.
   Mehdavi, the Mujahedeen's ``foreign minister,'' did not say what
the Iranian rebels would do if Khomeini died. But he said the force
that fought alongside the Iraqis against Iran in the latter stages
of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war had been trained to intervene in
Iran and overthrow the Tehran government.
   Mujahedeen leader Massoud Rajavi met with his military
commanders at a base near the Iranian border Saturday. Mujahedeen
sources said they discussed military and political options that
would be opened by Khomeini's death.
   The rebels' military strength never has been disclosed. Last
year it was estimated it had more than 15,000 troops, along with
tanks, artillery and other heavy weapons.
   Weeks before the war cease-fire took effect Aug. 20, the force
launched its biggest operation into western Iran, reaching the city
of Bakhtaran, 90 miles inside the country, before withdrawing
across the Iraqi border.
   The Mujahedeen claimed the operation was a major victory. But
Iran claimed the rebels were driven back with heavy losses.
Nonetheless, the rebel army's ability to thrust so deep into Iran
alarmed Tehran.
   The Mujahedeen were allied with Khomeini during the 1979
revolution that toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. But radicals
turned on the Mujahedeen and other leftist and liberal factions in
1980-81, killing and imprisoning tens of thousands of people.

   Q: Mr. President, as you know, the United States has strongly
opposed, and so has NATO, including aircraft in these negotiations
up to now. Could you tell us what your thinking was in deciding to
reverse that position and to propose the 15 percent cut?
   Bush: Trying to correct disparity. And it was really that
simple. And I realize there have been some concerns. We are very
understanding of the French reservation in this regard _ I might
say, very diplomatically and beautifully expressed by President
Mitterrand. But it is simply that _ disparity.
   Q: Mr. President, Secretary General Woerner spoke of the future
40 years being as important, if not more important, than the past
40 years of the alliance. He spoke about NATO's vision. Will NATO's
vision include an East-West alliance?
   Bush: I don't see an East-West alliance, but I see a Europe much
more free and one whose innate desire to have more democracy comes
to the surface. But I don't think _ I don't see it as an East and
West joining in some alliance, formal alliance, if that was what
the question was.
   Q: ... Now the Soviet Union isn't perceived as a threat anymore.
Surely an East-West alliance would then exist ....
   Bush: Well, I've answered my question on _ you asked me whether
I thought there would be some formal alliance between pact
countries _ I guess you meant between all the Warsaw Pact and NATO.
   And I don't think it would require a formal alliance in order to
have much, much better relationships that include security
considerations. But we're a long way from there. We're just
beginning to see the differentiation in Europe. And our whole
policy for the United States _ let me set aside NATO for a minute _
will be to watch for those changes and try to facilitate them and
work with those who are willing to move towards freedom and
democracy.
   Indeed, we've made some proposals on Poland. I will be going to
both Poland and Hungary. And I will make clear that if they move
towards these Western values that have served the Alliance so well
for a long time, that speaking for the United States, we will be
ready to have much better relations.
   Q: Mr. President, can you say this morning that there will be no
third zero? And if you can say it, why cannot the comprehensive
context?
   Bush: I thought I already did say it. There will be no third
zero. There will be no third zero. ``Partial'' means partial.
   Q: Mr. President, Vice President Quayle, in an interview with
reporters the other day, said that if some of these Eastern
European countries moved too far toward Western values, that the
Soviets might intervene militarily, and that we have not planned
how we might respond to that. He said we ought to do that.
   Do you agree that that's possible? He called it a big risk. Do
you agree it's a big risk? And do you think that we ought to be
deciding what we would do if the Soviets intervened?
   Bush: I'm old enough to remember Hungary in 1956, and I would
want to do nothing in terms of statement or exhortation that would
encourage a repeat of that. And so I would leave it right there.
   I'd like to think that the situation will move in the opposite
direction. But who would have predicted the kind of public up till
now peaceful demonstration in Tiananmen Square? Who would have
predicted the kind of move inside the Soviet Union on perestroika,
and indeed, glasnost? So when you're dealing with things as complex
as relations between countries, I think prudence is the order of
the day, and I've said that all along.
   But back to your question, I don't _ I don't think anyone knows
the answer to that. I mean, we're not certainly predicting that.
   Q: Well then, do you disagree with the vice president?
   Bush: I don't even know what he said. ... I learned _ I learned
long ago not to comment on things that I haven't read personally
when it's somebody _ when we're trying to get one member of an
administration to be juxtaposed against another. It's bad business,
and I'm not going to do that. But I have great confidence in the
vice president, I might add, and I think his pronouncements on
foreign policy have been very sound.
   Q: Mr. President, notwithstanding the obvious fact that they all
work for you anyway, how much of a problem, if any, did you have
getting the Pentagon on board on these proposals?
   Bush: The Pentagon did what it should have done, and they looked
at various options from the military standpoint, and they analyzed
it. And the Joint Chiefs were fully engaged in the process. And my
contacts were principally, but not exclusively, with Bill Crowe.
   And I would _ one of the things I wanted to do, in talking to
our alliance partners, was assure them that our military were
behind it _ was behind the final proposal. Indeed, I was very
pleased, in talking to General Galvin before this proposal was
tabled, to have his assurances that what we have proposed here is
sound militarily. And that made it a much better position to
present to the alliance.

<TEXT>
   Q: Do you expect any foot dragging, or grumbling, or maybe even
a little leaking along the way, as you go forward?
   Bush: In our own leakproof bureaucracy? No, I don't expect that
_ and I would discourage it. But, is it apt to happen? I would hope
not.
   Q: Mr. President, were you at any point unhappy with the pace of
the projections of that slow and lengthy policy review, to the
extent, as you decribed, you had a 12-day sort of crash course to
come up with a super proposal. Could you give us some of your
personal _ how you got to this point?
   Bush: Well, first we undertook these reviews. I'm not sure all
our _ everyone here understands that. And I said that I needed some
time when I became president, new president, January 20th, to
review not only this subject, NATO-related subjects, but a wide
array of subjects.
   We're almost through all the reviews, and ... during this time,
I came under some fire for being recalcitrant, reluctant to move
forward. Indeed, when Mr. Gorbachev would make one of his many
proposals, they would be coming to me and saying, ``Well, don't you
think you have to do something?'' And I would say, ``No, we want to
take our time and act in a prudent manner.''
   I had in my mind that what we wanted to do was to be sure that
the alliance was together on any _ or would come together on any
proposal we made to the alliance. But I think there was some
feeling in Congress, some criticism of my speed, or lack of it, in
the United States Congress. But I'm so immune to political
criticism that I just kind of write it off. I was elected to do
what I think is right, and I think we've come up with a good
proposal here.
   And I will end, this being the last question, not with a
filibuster, but simply to say I have been told by others here that
the alliance really has never had a meeting that's more upbeat and
where we've taken rather significant steps in unity.
   And so, whatever the weight, whatever the political arrows might
have been fired my way, it's all been worth it, because I think we
have something sound and solid to build on now. And again, I end by
thanking my colleagues, the other heads of government, chiefs of
state that were here, for the total cooperation and the spirit in
which these proposals were received and discussed, and the way in
which NATO adopted its final position. I think it's a good thing,
it's good for NATO. I really happen to believe that it's good for
the entire free world.
   Thank you all very much.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Decision Against Anti-Abortion Counseling Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to lift the
strict advertising limits imposed on a Texas counseling center that
authorities called a ``fake abortion clinic'' run by anti-abortion
activists.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that ads run by
the Problem Pregnancy Center in Fort Worth violated a state law
banning deceptive trade practices.
   The center is run by a charitable corporation, Mother and Unborn
Baby Care of North Texas Inc. Lawyers for the center had argued
that the state deceptive-practices law should not apply because the
center receives no money for services it provides.
   State Assistant Attorney General Stephen Gardner urged the
justices to reject what he said was a request for ``a
constitutional right to lie to pregnant women, to entice them into
a fake abortion clinic'' where they are urged to continue their
pregnancy.
   A state court jury ordered the center and its director, Charles
J. Pelletier II, to include prominently in all future ads that the
center is not an abortion clinic and does not provide abortion
referrals or medical services.
   The jury also imposed $39,000 in civil fines and ordered the
center's corporate operator and Pelletier to pay $49,025 in
attorneys fees incurred by the state.
   A state appeals court upheld the jury verdict, and the Texas
Supreme Court refused to review the case last Nov. 16.
   Pelletier placed ads in the Fort Worth Yellow Pages under the
heading ``Abortion Information and Services.''
   During a seven-month period in 1986, more than 1,000 women went
to the center, most of them then considering an abortion.
   According to the state appeals court, the women generally were
given a free pregnancy test. While waiting for the results, they
were taken into a room to see slides and a videotape showing
graphic pictures of abortion procedures.
   Counselors, including Pelletier, then attempted to persuade the
women not to abort their pregnancies, according to the state court.
   State authorities said, ``The record of the jury trial is
replete with the experiences of pregnant women who were tricked
into going to Pelletier's center by Pelletier's deceptive
representations.''
   They added, ``Pelletier used the tactics of avoidance, evasion
and concealment to draw in as many women considering an abortion as
possible to force them to hear his message without regard to their
willingness or need to hear it.''
   The appeal filed in behalf of the center and Pelletier said
numerous legal actions similar to the Texas lawsuit ``have been
filed across the country against anti-abortion clincs to prevent
them from being able to communicate information on abortion to
those pregnant women.''
   The appeal added, ``In a truly free society, speech which is
non-defamatory, non-obscene and does not economically benefit the
speaker, directly or indirectly, must remain free of any
constraints.''
   The case is Mother and Unborn Bab Care of North Texas vs. Texas,
88-1627.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Block Lawsuit Involving Witness Protection Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to block a
lawsuit by a Philadelphia man whose daughter was placed in the
federal witness protection program without his knowledge.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments aimed at giving
federal officials greater protection against being sued.
   Anthony Prisco sued two former attorneys general and another
federal official in 1985. He said his rights were violated when his
daughter, Lauren, now 9, was moved to a new home with her mother,
Maria, and her mother's new husband, Michael Morris.
   The Priscos were divorced in 1983 after six years of marriage.
Prisco's ex-wife remarried, and soon after Morris was assigned to
the witness protection program. He had cooperated with the FBI in
an investigation of organized crime's drug trade in the
Philadelphia area.
   Under the government program, such cooperating witnesses and
their families are given new identities and relocated to protect
them from retribution.
   Prisco, with the help of a private investigator and a lawyer,
tracked down his daughter. He later won shared custody of Lauren.
When his ex-wife died, Prisco was granted full custody.
   Prisco sued William French Smith, who was attorney general when
Lauren was relocated in the witness program, and Edwin Meese III,
who held the position when the suit was filed.
   The witness protection program is run by the U.S. Marshals
Service, and its director, Stanley Morris, also was named as a
defendant.
   The three defendants sought to have the suit thrown out on
immunity grounds, arguing they should be shielded from such claims.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against them last
July.
   The appeals court said it was premature to consider the appeals
by Morris and Meese, who was still attorney general last July. Any
consideration of whether they enjoy immunity must wait until after
a trial on the lawsuit, the appeals court said.
   Justice Department lawyers, in seeking Supreme Court review,
said barring federal officials from appealing prior to trial will
chill their freedom to make policy decisions.
   The 3rd Circuit court acknowledged that the rationale for giving
such legal immunity ``is that we do not want officials to make
discretionary decisions with one wary eye on their pocketbook.''
   But the appeals court said Prisco's suit also seeks a court
order to prevent public officials from violating his rights in the
future. Since Prisco seeks more than money, the case against Meese
and Morris must proceed to trial, the appeals court said.
   It said the suit against Smith raises a different issue because
he had left office before Prisco sued and thus no longer was in a
position to violate Prisco's right to know the whereabouts of his
daughter.
   But the appeals court rejected Smith's arguments that he is
entitled to legal immunity because at the time Lauren was assigned
to the witness program, a father's constitutional right to be told
of his daughter's relocation had not been established by the courts.
   ``Smith's contention that Prisco's rights to some form of notice
was not clearly established in 1983 is totally unpersuasive,'' the
appeals court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers also
argued that Smith lacked personal involvement in the Prisco case _
and therefore should not have to face a potentially costly judgment.
   Prisco ``alleged nothing more than that Smith had supervised the
Department of Justice during the relevant period,'' the government
lawyers said.
   The case is Smith vs. Prisco, 88-1039.

<HEAD>Wright Indicates He Has Made Decision on Whether to Resign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright indicated today he
has made a decision about whether to resign in the face of ethics
charges, but refused to say what he intends to do.
   Wright, who is widely expected to announce his resignation on
Wednesday, told reporters, ``I think I know what I should do.''
   ``I think I know what I believe to be in my best interests and
the interests of the institution. I want to be fair to myself, my
family, my reputation, and I want to be fair to this institution
that I've served for 34 years,'' the Texas Democrat told reporters.
   Wright said he would have a statement on his plans later this
week.
   Sources close to Wright have said he is likely to announce a
decision to resign from his leadership post as early as Wednesday,
but they cautioned that Wright was torn between such a move and
fighting the ethics charges to some legal conclusion.
   More pressure to resign was applied to Wright over the weekend,
when his No. 2 lieutenant, Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of
California, abruptly announced his own plans to resign from the
House rather than face ethics charges involving a junk bond
investment. He said such a process would hurt the party.
   Wright alluded to his legal fight and to a motion to dismiss the
most serious charges against him, telling reporters, ``I'm
convinced our motions are legally well grounded.''
   The ethics committee is due to take up the motion to dismiss
charges at a meeting on Thursday, and it is seen as likely to
reject the defense effort.
   Wright added: ``I`m convinced I haven't violated any rule of the
House, as I understand them and as I think other members do. I have
for 34 years abided by them, honored them... That is my absolute
conviction.''
   Wright has been formally charged with 69 instances of violating
House rules, including charges he circumvented limits on outside
income through bulk sales of a book he wrote and charges he
improperly accepted $145,000 in gifts from a Fort Worth, Texas,
businessman with a direct interest in legislation.

<TEXT>
   The head of the country's secret police
today escaped injury in a car-bomb attack that killed at least
three people and injured 35, authorities said.
   The bomb, planted in a white Chevrolet Monza, exploded in an
affluent northern neighborhood of Bogota as Gen. Miguel Maza
Marquez passed in his bullet-proof official car, police said.
   Maza Marquez heads the Administrative Department of Security,
the Colombian secret police. Nicknamed ``Kojak'' by his countrymen,
Maza Marquez has been aggressive in investigating the country's
billion-dollar cocaine trafficking industry.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
   Police said the bomb apparently was detonated by remote control.
It reduced the Monza to twisted metal, damaged several buildings
and shattered windows as far as three blocks away. The size or type
of bomb were not immediately known.
   According to police, the bomb killed one of Maza Marquez's
bodyguards. Also killed were a police officer and a woman who
happened to be passing when the explosion occurred.
   Maza Marquez suffered only bruises on the ribs and chest,
authorities at a nearby military hospital said. Seven of his
bodyguards were injured, three of them seriously, police said.
   According to the Bogota National Radio Chain, 35 people were
treated for injuries. Many were cut by flying glass.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Decision Barring Prayers Before High School Games</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a decision
banning organized prayers at the start of high school football
games.
   The court, without comment, refused to review a ruling in a
Georgia case that such pregame invocations impermissibly promote
religion.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, by a 2-1 vote last Jan.
3, said prayers carried over the public address system before
Douglas County, Ga., High School home football games had to stop.
   In a ruling affecting all public schools in Georgia, Alabama and
Florida, the appeals court said the organized prayers violated the
separation of church and state required by past Supreme Court
decisions.
   But lawyers for the Douglas County school board told the
justices that pregame prayers have become ``as much a part of the
tradition of high school football as the national anthem, marching
bands, cheerleaders and baton twirlers.''
   The school board's lawyers noted that the Rev. Billy Graham
delivered a prayer and benediction at President Bush's inauguration
in January, and that each Supreme Court session begins with an
invocation for divine assistance: ``God save the United States and
this honorable court.''
   The appeal acted on today argued that the Douglas County
football invocations should be reinstated on the same
``traditional'' grounds used by the justices when in 1983 they
upheld states' practice of opening legislative sessions with
prayers.
   The 11th Circuit court rejected that argument. Noting that
although state legislatures have conducted prayer sessions for over
200 years, the appeals court said, ``Invocations at
school-sponsored football games were nonexistent when the
Constitution was adopted.''
   The appeals court instead relied on the Supreme Court's 1962
decision banning organized, school-sponsored prayer sessions and
its 1963 decision banning daily Bible readings.
   The appeals court also invoked a 1971 decision in which the
Supreme Court created a three-part test to judge the validity of
laws challenged as violating the constitutional ban on
``establishment'' of religion.
   Under that test, a law or governmental practice escapes legal
attacks if it has a secular or non-religious purpose, its primary
effect neither advances nor inhibits religion and it does not
unduly entangle government and religion.
   The prayers conducted before Douglas County High football games
failed all three parts of the 1971 test, the appeals court said.
   The pregame prayers were challenged in 1986 by Doug Jager, then
a Douglas County High senior and member of the school's marching
band, and his father, William.
   Doug Jager told The Associated Press that year that his family
was deluged with threats after his lawsuit.
   ``A couple of callers have threatened to burn down our house.
Others have threatened to wrap my saxophone around my head,'' Jager
said in an interview.
   Jager three years ago described himself as ``more agnostic than
anything else.'' His younger brother still attends the high school.
   The 11th Circuit court said the Douglas County High invocations,
at least until 1986, often mentioned Jesus Christ, and that school
officials refused to substitute the invocations with nonreligious
inspirational messages.
   ``It is clear,'' the appeals court said, ``that the school
district was most interested in ... invocations that publicly
express support for Protestant Christianity.''
   The case is Douglas County School District vs. Jager, 88-1610.

<HEAD>Fuel Line Leak Almost Puts Airliner Into Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A TWA jumbo jet made an emergency landing after
developing a fuel leak and running low on fuel, and airline
officials said they weren't sure how close it came to a forced
ditching in the Pacific.
   TWA's Flight 235, bound from Los Angeles to Honolulu with 205
people aboard, landed early Monday at Hilo International Airport on
the island of Hawaii, 200 miles southeast of Honolulu, because it
was the closest airport, said TWA spokesman Don Morrison in St.
Louis.
   Asked about a televised news report here that the Lockheed
L-1011 had about four minutes of fuel left when it landed, Morrison
said that had not been determined.
   Passenger Domenic Silvestri said he could hear crewmembers
behind a curtain reviewing ditching procedures.
   The pilot reported at 11:30 p.m. HST Sunday that the jet was low
on fuel and 450 miles out of Honolulu, and was instructed to divert
to Hilo, said Dick Hallen, a Federal Aviation Administration duty
officer in Los Angeles.
   Going to Hilo cut about 110 miles off the flight, according to
an FAA calculation.
   Morrison said the plane's left engine was shut down after the
crew realized fuel was leaking from the wing.
   ``The captain was not able to do anything to stop the leak,'' he
said.
   Passengers said they were only told that something was wrong
with the left engine.
   Two F-15 fighters from the Hawaii Air National Guard and a Coast
Guard C-130 search-and-rescue airplane escorted the TWA plane to
Hilo, where it made a routine landing at 12:40 a.m., said
Christopher Kimbrough of the Joint Rescue Coordination Center in
Honolulu.
   Fire-crash rescue crews could see fuel leaking from the wing
after it landed, said Marilyn Kali, a state Transportation
Department spokeswoman.
   Morrison said the cause of the leak was under investigation.
   The 190 passengers, including rock singer Bobby Brown, were kept
at the Hilo airport terminal until dawn when they were put on
chartered jets to take them to Honolulu.
   ``It was rough, but I'm glad we got home safely. I'm glad the
Lord brought us here,'' said Brown, who came for a series of
concerts.
   However, he and other passengers complained about their
treatment at Hilo.
   ``It was like being held hostage, you know, by your own people,
by TWA,'' Brown said.
   Other passengers complained they were given no food or drink and
had to contend with dirty restrooms during their wait.

   The government put 109 Vietnamese refugees on a
remote island without shelter today in an effort to cope with the
surging numbers of arriving boat people, officials said.
   ``We have had over 2,300 arrivals over the past three days. Our
accomodation resources have simply been overwhelmed,'' said Hong
Kong refugee coordinator Mike Hanson.
   Officials said 745 boat people arrived today and 109 were towed
to Tai A Chau, an island 20 miles southwest of Hong Kong, because
other refugee facilities were filled.
   Hanson said the boat people would be staying in their boat or on
the dock at Tai A Chau. ``There is one school building which some
people may be able to use, but I think most will not be able to
have covered accomodations,'' he said.
   Hanson said the boat people would remain on the island until the
government could find a place to process them.
   In June, Hong Kong adopted a screening policy that treats all
incoming Vietnamese boat people as illegal immigrants subject to
repatriation unless they can prove they fled political persecution.
   But the policy has not curbed the mounting arrivals of
Vietnamese. For the first five months in 1989, 13,182 boat people
have arrived at the British colony.
   Under international pressure, Vietnam has agreed to attend an
international conference on Indochinese refugees in Geneva on June
13-14.

   For the second time in less than a

squabbled over food and demanded to meet with prison officials.
   One inmate suffered a minor cut on his hand when inmates began
banging on their cells at the Zavala County Detention Center Monday
afternoon, assistant prison administrator L.B. Gamble said.
   Gamble said the disturbance, which lasted about 30 minutes, was
a minor incident. ``They just didn't like what they had to eat

menu.
   The disturbance ended, he said, when he agreed to talk to some

   On May 23, federal inmates protesting the food and other
conditions at the privately run Eden Detention Center in Eden
refused to return to their dormitories overnight and negotiated
with authorities in the courtyard May 24.

   Julia Duffy lied about her bra size, Stacy
Keach tried to convince producers he could sing and Jackee
pretended to be an expert dancer, all in an effort to beat the
competition for coveted parts.
   In the latest edition of TV Guide, Duffy of CBS' ``Newhart''
admits altering her bra size when the part called for a fuller
figure.
   Keach, the actor who plays Mike Hammer, convinced producers of
``Barnum'' he could sing while walking a tightrope, and Estell
Getty, of NBC's ``Golden Girls,'' has been fibbing for years about
being 5 feet tall when she's actually shorter. She still won't
specify her height, the Radnor-based magazine says.
   Then there are white lies committed in the form of an altered
resume.
   Jackee, of NBC's ``227,'' inflated her resume for a part in the
Broadway musical ``New Orleans'' to say she took eight years of
dance with Alvin Ailey and two years with Frank Hatchett, Gregory
Hines' teacher.
   ``I figured they wouldn't check,'' she said.
   They didn't have to, especially after they saw her try to dance.
But her sense of comedy ultimately landed her the role.

<HEAD>Lee Huan Confirmed as Premier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators today confirmed veteran
politician Lee Huan as Taiwan's new premier to succeed Yu Kuo-hwa,
who had been criticized for his cautious approach to economic and
political reforms.
   Lee, educated at Columbia University in New York and South
Korea's Dangkook University, is among the most liberal senior
officials of the governing Nationalist Party and takes over as
Taiwan is trying to gain international recognition.
   Younger Nationalist legislators considered his predecessor, the
75-year-old Yu, a liability as the party prepared for December
parliamentary elections. Yu had governed since 1984 and nominated
Lee to succeed him.
   Today's vote in Parliament, where Nationalists hold 254 of the
289 seats, was 217 to 24. Nine votes were declared invalid and 39
legislators were absent.
   All 12 members of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
voted against Lee's confirmation because they said they first
wanted him to outline his political plans to Parliament.
Legislative officials said Cabinet appointees seldom address the
house before being confirmed.
   Lee, 72, was nominated by his party, whose parliamentary
majority ensured his confirmation.
   He is expected to announce a 25-member Cabinet on Wednesday amid
reports he will make only minor changes. The new premier, who has
been secretary-general of the governing party since 1987, helped
groom a number of incumbent Cabinet ministers. He helped Chiang
Ching-kuo end 38 years of martial law in Taiwan two years ago.
   Newspapers had reported that Lee planned to include a member of
the Democratic Progressive Party in his Cabinet, but the press said
today he changed his mind after objections were raised.
   The appointment would have been unprecedented. The Nationalists
have not included an opponent in a Cabinet since they retreated to
Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war in China. Since then, they
have dominated the island's politics.

<TEXT>
   A trial over ownership of four sixth-century
Byzantine mosaics, considered to be worth millions of dollars,
begins today in a case that could have serious impact on art work
considered national treasures.
   On one side are lawyers representing the Greek Orthodox Church
of Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus, and on the other local art
dealer Peg L. Goldberg.
   The mosaics, each about two feet square, are said to have been
chiseled from the interior of a small church in northern Cyprus
sometime before 1982 and are considered some of the oldest
Christian antiquities.
   Experts see the case as a landmark in the growing worldwide
effort by less-developed nations to reclaim and protect national
treasures.
   The mosaics took a circuitous trail from the Mediterranean
island to Indiana, attracting an exotic cast of characters
including reputed international art smugglers and warring Greek and
Turkish Cypriots.
   It was a year ago when Goldberg learned of the mosaics _ tile
portraits of Jesus as a boy, an archangel and the apostles Matthew
and James.
   Goldberg said she fell in love with the mosaics when shown them
in July 1988 in Geneva by a Turk who claimed to be the former state
archaeologist of Turkish-occupied Cyprus. He assured her they had
been legally exported, she said, and she paid $1.2 million for the
four tiles.
   Turkish Cypriot officials deny his credentials and his claim
that the artworks were legally exported.
   The Greek church and the Republic of Cyprus are suing in U.S.
District Court to get them back. The Turkish breakaway state on
Cyprus has filed a motion to intervene in the case.
   Goldberg's lawyer, Joe C. Emerson, says she acted in good faith
and even if the mosaics were stolen, the six-year statute of
limitations in such cases has expired and she is no longer liable
for prosecution.
   He says officials of the church and the Republic of Cyprus are
at fault for failing to properly notify the international community
of the theft.
   Washington lawyer Thomas R. Kline contends that despite
Goldberg's claim of good faith, the merchandise was stolen and
should be returned to its rightful owners in Cyprus.
   Walter Hopps, director of the Menil Collection in Houston, who
last year solved a similar problem through a loan agreement with
Cyprus, said the lawsuit will become a test case.
   He says if the courts uphold Goldberg, ``...then the possibility
exists that millions and millions of dollars worth of plundered
antiquities will pour into the United States. It will be a horrible
precedent.''

<HEAD>Court Upholds Judge's Ability To Impose Death Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state death penalty law does not have to
require juries, instead of judges, to make the specific findings
authorizing imposition of capital punishment, the Supreme Court
ruled today.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices upheld the death sentence of Florida
death row Paul Hildwin, convicted of a 1985 murder.
   Hildwin had argued that he was denied a fair sentencing trial
because jurors who recommended the death sentence did not make
specific findings of any ``aggravating circumstances.''
   The sentencing judge, however, found four such aggravationg
factors and no mitigating ones in imposing Hildwin's sentence.
   The nation's highest court previously upheld Florida's
sentencing system, ruling in 1984 that a jury trial is not required
on the life-or-death decision.
   ``The Sixth Amendment (guaranteeing fair trials) does not
require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of
the sentence of death be made by the jury,'' the court ruled today
in an unsigned opinion.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose
capital punishment under all circumstances, dissented.
   Hildwin was sentenced to death for the Sept. 9, 1985 strangling
of Vronzette Cox. Police said she was raped and killed, and her
body locked inside the trunk of a car left in some Hernando County
woods.
   The case is Hildwin vs. Florida, 88-6066.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter warned today against over-reacting to southern Iowa's
drought, but said he understands the long-range problems caused by
``a very strange'' weather pattern this year.
   The National Guard has hauled 300,000 gallons of drinking water
to several parched southern Iowa towns and ``we don't see an end to
it,'' National Guard Adjutant Tommy Thompson told Yeutter.
   In some sections of the state, wells must be drilled to 2,500
feet before reaching water, said Iowa Office of Disaster Services
Director Ellen Gordon.
   Yeutter was briefed by state officials and Iowa's congressional
delegation during a tour of several southern Iowa towns and farms.
   State officials told Yeutter that while recent rain has
bolstered topsoil moisture, long-range problems remain.
   ``I've been around agriculture long enough to know that you
can't always tell by what's on top,'' Yeutter said.
   Iowa State University Climatologist Elwyn Taylor said the state
may be entering a more normal rainfall period, but that it begins
the crop season even drier than last year.
   ``The outlook as we see it right now is for normal weather
conditions,'' Taylor said. However, he added, ``Normal isn't really
quite good enough.''
   ``It's a very strange year for that rainfall pattern,'' Yeutter
said. ``Without doubt the principal concern is a concern over hay
supplies.''
   Yeutter said there is still a chance for major crops like corn
and soybeans, and it is too early to talk about potential drought
damage to those crops.
   ``That's all conjecture at this point,'' he said.
   ``We have to be careful we don't overestimate the problem.''
   That view was backed up by Iowa State University crop specialist
Garren Benson, who said: ``We're off to a decent start. For row
corps it's far too early to tell.''
   June is normally the month when Iowa gets its heaviest rainfall.
Normal rain over the next few weeks could ease the drought, but
Benson warned that a dry June last year spelled death for much of
the state's agricultural production.
   ``This is the month that really killed us last year,'' Benson
said.

<TEXT>
   Bulgaria, seeking to head off criticism of its
treatment of its Turkish minority, took the offensive at an
international human rights conference today and blamed foreigners
for the ethnic unrest.
   Bulgaria is among 35 nations, including the United States,
attending the Conference on the Human Dimension, in which nations
will review human rights progress and take to task countries
accused of abuses.
   Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia and East Germany are expected
to be singled out during the monthlong conference.
   In one of the first speeches, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Petar
Mladenov went on the offensive, accusing ``foreign circles'' of
being behind recent disturbances in his country.
   Officials in Bulgaria say at least three ethnic Turks have been
killed in clashes with Bulgarian security forces, but Turkish
sources put the number as high as 30.
   Mladenov did not identify a country or group. But the Bulgarian
delegation made available the text of a speech by President Todor
Zhivkov saying ``certain circles in the Republic of Turkey'' have
launched a ``continuously escalating anti-Bulgarian campaign.''
   ``This policy represents a gross interference in the internal
affairs of a sovereign state,'' Zhivkov said.
   The Bulgarian president, whose speech was broadcast Monday,
called on Turkey to open its borders to all ``Bulgarian Moslems''
who want to go there.
   The violence stems from ethnic Turks' opposition to a Bulgarian
assimilation campaign, which includes forcing the country's 900,000
ethnic Turks to change their Moslem names.
   Bulgaria has been deporting ethnic Turks it considers
undesirable. An estimated 300 have been forced to leave, and most
have been sent to Austria and Yugoslavia. Scores have been picked
up by Turkish airliners for resettlement in Turkey.
   The conference that officially opened today is the first of
three dealing with human rights and mandated by the Vienna review
meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which ended in January.
   The conference is made up of all European countries except
Albania, and includes the United States and Canada. All signed the
1975 Helsinki Final Act.
   Unlike previous Helsinki human rights follow-up meetings, the
Paris conference is to examine how well human rights commitments
have been implemented.
   It will also be a testing ground for a mechanism worked out in
Vienna to call attention to human rights abuses within the 35
countries.
   ``In this century, far more people ... have been killed by
violations of human rights than in all the wars of this century,''
Morris B. Abram, who heads the U.S. delegation, said Monday.
   Abram said that Romania was in ``the most flagrant violation of
any of the states signatory to ... the promises of Helsinki.''

   Senior politicians today criticized the candidacy
of Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno for prime minister, saying he may
not win back public confidence in the government.
   Voters may not accept Uno because of his close political ties to
former prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, under whose 1982-87 tenure
the Recruit Co. influence-pedling scandal occurred, according to
party elder Zenko Suzuki.
   The affair led to public outry against the government.
   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party was expected on Thursday to
choose Uno to succeed Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who has said
he will resign to take responsibility for the scandal. Parliament
was to confirm the party choice Friday.
   But an apparent lack of consensus on Uno's candidacy meant the
decision might be delayed, officials said.
   Former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda suggested today the party
should be ruled by a group rather than one person. Former Deputy
Prime Minister Susumu Nikaido said the party should not hurry in
choosing the next leader, news reports said.
   Takeshita reportedly agreed to examine the proposals and meet
again with party leaders.
   Recruit Co., an information and publishing conglomerate,
allegedly sought government favors through huge political donations
and bargain-priced share sales. Nakasone, Takeshita and ruling
party secretary-general Shintaro Abe are among those linked to the
scandal. Seventeen politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen have
been charged.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze today
called President Bush's proposals for troop cuts in Europe a
serious step in the right direction.
   In his address to the first day of an East-West conference on
human rights, Shevardnadze said the Soviet delegation at Vienna
talks on conventional disarmament would be ready to discuss the
ideas in detail.
   Bush has proposed cutting American and Soviet troops to 275,000
on each side and negotiating new ceilings for tanks, aircraft and
other conventional weapons on the European continent.
   ``We consider the declaration made by President Bush in Brussels
as a serious and important step in the right direction,''
Shevardnadze said.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union had been calling on the
United States to reduce troops and arms in Europe ``in the context
of a reduction of a general level of confrontation on the
continent.''
   In briefer comments to reporters on his arrival, Shevardnaze
said Bush's proposals would be studied carefully.
   But he added, ``It will take time to examine the American
proposals in detail and determine the position of the USSR.''
   Shevardnadze told reporters that Bush's proposal to accelerate
the pace of Vienna negotiations on conventional disarmament was
``attractive,'' but said, ``Only experience will tell how much time
it will take to arrive at mutually acceptable solutions.''

<HEAD>New Foreign Investment Spending in US Up Sharply in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign investors spent $65 billion to acquire
or establish U.S. businesses last year, up sharply from the $40.3
billion spent in 1987, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department attributed the 61.3 percent increase in
spending last year over the 1987 level to a surge in large
transactions, with the number of investments worth $1 billion
doubling from six to 12 in 1988.
   Those 12 investments accounted for 80 percent of the increase in
spending last year.
   The $65 billion in outlays included $60 billion spent to acquire
existing U.S. businesses and $5 billion to establish new
operations. Some $16.4 billion of the money was spent by foreign
direct investors, while $48.6 billion was spent by U.S. affiliates
of foreign companies.
   The department said several factors have made foreign investment
in the United States attractive in recent years, including strong
U.S. economic growth which made target companies potentially more
profitable, a large consumer market, political stability, and a
strong technological base.
   In addition, the wave of corporate restructuring in the United
States provided foreigners with investment opportunities and the
decline of the dollar against foreign currencies probably led some
firms to shift operations to the United States, the department said.
   Concern about foreign ownership of U.S. assets in the United
States has prompted moves in Congress to require greater disclosure
about foreign investors and their purchases.
   The Commerce Department said the biggest portion of the outlays
by foreign investors last year for acquisitions and new businesses
was the $31.6 billion spent in manufacturing, followed by $8
billion in retail trade and $5.8 billion in insurance.
   Britain was the biggest spender, at $21.5 billion, followed by
Japan, at $14.2 billion, and Canada at $10.4 billion.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Mining Companies' Bid To Limit Royalties Paid for Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mining companies seeking to revive a 5 percent
cap on the royalties they pay to help finance Arizona public
schools suffered an 8-0 defeat in the Supreme Court today.
   The justices upheld a ruling by the state's highest court that
the cap, established by the state Legislature in 1941, violates
federal law.
   Today's decision is a victory for the Arizona Education
Association, a teachers union, and those taxpayers who challenged
the cap.
   The case now will return to a state trial court, which was
ordered by the state Supreme Court to determine what further
relief, if any, is appropriate.
   The dispute has its roots in Arizona's drive for statehood. The
1910 law in which Congress authorized people in Arizona and New
Mexico to form state governments placed strict controls over how
the new states could use land set aside to help finance public
schools.
   Nearly 10 million acres in Arizona was covered by the law, and
the state _ Arizona was admitted into the union of states in 1912 _
was required to obtain ``true value'' in disposing of the land and
its products.
   At issue in the case decided today was whether a 1927 law passed
by Congress loosened those strict controls. Lawyers for the mining
companies argued that it had, but the high court today disagreed.
   The Arizona Legislature in 1941 permitted the state to lease the
trust lands for a royalty of 5 percent ``of the net value of the
minerals produced'' from the land.
   The lawsuit filed by Arizona Education Association and certain
taxpayers contended successfully that the 5 percent cap allows a
giveaway of resources intended to be used for the state's schools.
   They said royalty rates could be determined by competitive
bidding, administrative rules or case-by-case negotiation. They
also urged that royalties be based on gross mineral value to bar
companies from avoiding having to pay the state anything if costs
exceed mineral values.
   The state's royalty payments from the trust lands declined from
nearly $8 million in 1980 to $1.3 million in 1986.
   Mining companies have paid from 6 to 14 percent in royalties on
land owned by Indian tribes in Arizona, the justices were told.
   Writing for the court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said, ``The
sale or lease of mineral lands granted to the state of Arizona
under these federal statutes must substantially conform to the
mandatory requirements set out in the (1910 law).''
   He said the Arizona Supreme Court was correct in ``declaring
(the 5 percent cap) invalid as to nonhydrocarbon mineral leases.''
   Kennedy's 25-page opinion included a 17-page discussion on why
the justices hold the proper authority _ what lawyers call
jurisdiction _ to decide the case.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall,
Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens joined Kennedy's opinion on
the merits of the case.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Antonin Scalia voted to
dismiss the case due to a lack of jurisdiction, which also would
have resulted in a loss for the mining companies.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's only native Arizonan,
did not participate in the decision.
   The case is Asarco vs. Kadish, 87-1661.

   The Supreme Court today barred the divorced
spouses of military veterans from sharing in retirement pay the
veterans have converted into disability benefits.
   In a 7-2 ruling in a California case, the justices said a 1982
federal law does not permit state court divorce decrees to divide
the disability benefits.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said, ``We
realize that reading the statute literally may inflict economic
harm on many former spouses. But we decline to misread the statute
in order to reach a sympathetic result when such a reading requires
us to do violence to the plain language of the statute and ignore
much of the legislative history.''
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in a dissenting opinion, said,
``The harsh reality of this holding is that former spouses ... can,
without their consent, be denied a fair share of their ex-spouse's
military pension simply because he elects to increase his after-tax
income by converting a portion of that pension into disability
benefits.''
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined O'Connor in dissent.
   The case stems from the 1979 divorce of Gerald and Gaye Mansell
after 25 years of a marriage that produced six children.
   Mansell, a retired Air Force major, receives $1,200 a month in
retirement pay and $482 in disability benefits. The disability
benefits were converted from retirement pay by Mansell because,
unlike the pension, they are exempt from taxes.
   The divorce settlement, filed in Merced County, Calif., awarded
Gaye Mansell half the retirement pay in an uncontested split of
that money and, originally, half the disability benefits.
   But Mansell went to court in 1983 to modify the divorce decree
and exclude the disability pay.
   The California courts rejected his request.
   California is a community property state, meaning property
acquired during marriage is considered jointly owned.
   In other action today, the Supreme Court:
   _Refused to lift strict advertising limits imposed on a Texas
counseling center that authorities called a ``fake abortion
clinic'' run by anti-abortion activists. The justices, without
comment, let stand rulings that ads run by the Problem Pregnancy
Center in Fort Worth violated a state law banning deceptive trade
practices.
   State Assistant Attorney General Stephen Gardner contended that
the center was seeking ``a constitutional right to lie to pregnant
women, to entice them into a fake abortion clinic'' where they are
urged to continue their pregnancy.
   _Let stand a decision banning organized prayers at the start of
high school football games, refusing without comment to review a
ruling in a Georgia case that such pregame invocations
impermissibly promote religion.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, by a 2-1 vote last Jan.
3, said prayers carried over the public address system before
Douglas County, Ga., High School home football games had to stop
because they violated the separation of church and state required
by past Supreme Court rulings. The appeals court decision affected
all public schools in Georgia, Alabama and Florida.
   _Refused to reinstate the conviction of a California man,
Stephen Edward Leichty, who admitted he tried illegally to ship a
drug via air freight. Without comment, the court left intact a
ruling that police unlawfully searched the shipment without a
court-issued search warrant.
   _Ruled 7-2 in a Florida case that a state death penalty law does
not have to require juries, instead of judges, to make the specific
findings authorizing imposition of capital punishment.
   The justices upheld the death sentence of Paul Hildwin,
convicted of the Sept. 9, 1985 strangling of Vronzette Cox. Police
said she was raped and killed and her body was locked inside the
trunk of a car left in some woods.
   _Defeated by an 8-0 decision a bid by mining companies to revive
a 5 percent cap on the royalties they pay to help finance Arizona
public schools. The justices upheld a ruling by the state's highest
court that the cap, established by the state Legislature in 1941,
violates federal law.
   The military benefits and divorce case involved a federal law
Congress passed in 1982 following a Supreme Court ruling that
barred state courts from dividing military pay in divorces. The
law, called the Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act,
allows retirement pay to be subjected to alimony awards.
   The high court said today that the law does not cover military
pay veterans are allowed to convert to other purposes.
   ``Under the act's plain and precise language, state courts have
been granted the authority to treat disposable retired pay as
community property. They have not been granted the authority to
treat total retired pay as community property,'' said Marshall.
   The Justice Department, which sided initially with Mrs. Mansell,
changed its mind late last year and concluded that her former
husband's interpretation of the 1982 law is correct.
   The case is Mansell vs. Mansell, 87-201.

   Federally mandated rules for doling out kidneys
discriminate against blacks, who receive proportionally fewer
organs than whites even though they are four times as likely to
suffer kidney failure, some experts say.
   ``I don't consider it a national tragedy. I consider it
ignorance. As we become more enlightened, then we expect (the
system) to be more fair,'' said Howard University's Dr. Clive O.
Callender, one of the nation's few black transplant surgeons.
   The 1{-year-old rules adopted by the United Network for Organ
Sharing, which administers the national transplant network,
emphasize tissue-matching between kidney donors and recipients.
   Callender and some others contend the rules put blacks at a
disadvantage because a fifth of them have tissue-matching problems
that make them wait longer for kidneys, most of which are donated
by whites.
   ``At the time the rules were made, that information was not
perceived as discriminatory,'' Callender said. ``But we now know it
because of studies on the black immune system.''
   Dr. William Vaughn, the network's director of technical
services, acknowledges the rules aren't perfect but adds, ``it's a
good system within the confines that we have to work inside of.''
   ``You can't put out quotas'' on organ transplants, said Dr. Paul
Eggers, chief of the federal Health Care Financing Administration's
program evaluation branch.
   Transplant specialists have long disputed the importance of
tissue-matching for kidneys and will continue that debate at their
annual meeting, which begins today in Chicago.
   Proponents say the success rate for kidney recipients improves
considerably when tissue is matched closely, but critics contend
the gains are not great enough to justify letting donated organs
deteriorate until a close match is found.
   ``Even if (tissue typing) is important, should we weaken its
importance in the interest of getting minorities a better chance to
get a transplant, even if if lowers the success of the operation?''
asked Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics
at the University of Minnesota.
   The standardized scoring system in effect since Oct. 1, 1987,
also takes into account severity of illness, length of time
waiting, proximity to the donor, size and blood compatibility.
   During 1988, the first full year during which the network
collected donor and recipient data, whites received 71 percent, or
2,936, of the kidneys transplanted in the United States. Blacks
received 21.7 percent, or 896 of the transplanted kidneys, and
Hispanics 7.4 percent, or 304 kidneys.
   Whites also got 88.9 percent, or 1,647, of the hearts
transplanted last year; 85.9 percent, or 997, of livers, and 97.6
percent, or 160, of pancreases, according to statistics just
released by the network.
   On the opposite end, 83.2 percent of the 4,083 brain-dead
victims whose organs were donated in 1988 were white. About 8.6
percent were black and 5.9 percent were Hispanic, well below their
population share.
   Sixty-two percent of the donors were male. Men also dominated on
the receiving side, getting 79.2 percent of hearts transplanted
last year, 49.7 percent of livers, 60.6 percent of kidneys and 56.4
percent of pancreases.
   The Virginia-based network excluded from its calculations
recipients whose race or sex were not reported.
   ``Race has nothing to do with who gets allocated the organ.
Neither does sex,'' Vaughn said. ``It comes back to who's on the
list and who has the disease.''
   Blacks have more kidney failure than any other group, according
to Callender, because of their proclivity toward high blood
pressure.
   One-third of the 107,000 Americans on dialysis are black. And
one-third of the nearly 15,000 people awaiting kidney transplants
are black, according to Vaughn.
   The gap between black and white kidney recipients ``could be an
unconscious bias or a self-selection thing, too,'' Eggers said.
   Blacks are reluctant to donate organs for the same reasons they
are wary of transplantation, according to Callender. Those reasons
include religious beliefs, lack of transplant awareness, fear of
premature death and distrust of the white-dominated medical
community.
   ``We don't really know what patients want,'' said Dr. Philip
Held, program director of the renal research program at The Urban
Institute in Washington.
   Held recently reported wealthy white men were likelier to get a
new kidney from 1981 to 1986 than poor white men. The same held
true for black men: the higher the income, the likelier a
transplant.
   Both dialysis and kidney transplantation are covered under the
federal Medicare program regardless of a person's age.
   Poorer access to health care may limit transplants for many
women, minorities and lower-income individuals, Caplan said.
   ``If Americans don't all have an equal chance at access to a
primary care doctor, forget about a transplant surgeon,'' he said.

   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate
the conviction of a California man who admitted he tried illegally
to ship a drug via air freight.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that police
unlawfully searched the shipment.
   California prosecutors asked the high court to revive Stephen
Edward Leichty's conviction.
   He pleaded no defense to possessing methamphetamine with intent
to sell the drug, and was sentenced to 120 days in jail and three
years probation. Methamphetamine is a stimulant that may not be
sold without a prescription.
   A California appeals court threw out Leichty's conviction last
November.
   The charges against him stemmed from the suspicions of Michael
Brooks, supervisor at an air freight facility at Ontario Airport in
California.
   In September 1986, Brooks smelled ether in an empty five-gallon
plastic container shipped to Leichty. Brooks told Leichty that
shipping ether on an airplane is dangerous and requires special
precautions.
   A few weeks later, Brooks said Leichty came to the terminal with
a package for shipment. The air cargo supervisor said Leichty
seemed to be very nervous and wore dark glasses inside the poorly
lit terminal.
   Brooks, fearing the package might be dangerous, opened it up and
found two soda bottles filled with a yellow liquid. The bottles
were packed in paper and potato chips, possibly to cover up the
liquid's odor. Handwritten labels on the bottles said they
contained model airplane oil.
   Brooks called the police, who conducted inconclusive tests of
the substance at the airport. The bottles then were taken to a Los
Angeles police laboratory where the substance was identified as
methamphetamine oil.
   The police then obtained a warrant to search the dormitory room
of Leichty _ a student at Harvey Mudd College, the all
science-oriented member of the Claremont Colleges group in
Claremont, Calif. _ and found chemical ingredients and apparatus
used to make methamphetamine.
   Leichty admitted he was manufacturing the drug.
   The state appeals court that overturned Leichty's conviction
ruled that police violated his rights when they tested the liquid
at the police laboratory without a court-issued search warrant.
   The appeals court said the police lab tests were not designed
strictly to identify only contraband, as were the less
sophisticated tests at the airport. The police lab tests could
``have revealed the identity of the contents even if it were a
substance in which defendant had a legitimate privacy interest,''
the appeals court said.
   The Supreme Court in 1984 reinstated cocaine-possession
convictions against a Minnesota couple in a similar case. The
convictions stemmed from the suspicions of an air freight worker
who looked inside a damaged carboard box addressed to the couple.
   But the California appeals court said in Leichty's case the
police lab tests were broader than those used to identify cocaine
in the Minnesota case.
   ``There is no evidence that the (Los Angeles police) lab tests
were limited only to those which would reveal the presence of
contraband drugs,'' the state court said.
   The California attorney general's office urged the justices to
use the case to allow police to search without a warrant whenever a
package shipped by a private company is ``obviously contraband.''
   The case is California vs. Leichty, 88-1666.

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Award Won By Mother of Jailed Man Who Committed
Suicide</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today set aside a $157,500
award won by the mother of a Los Angeles County man who committed
suicide in jail.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote, told a federal appeals court to
restudy its ruling that the inmate's rights were violated because
he was not given adequate psychiatric care.
   The justices told the lower court to reconsider its ruling in
light of their Feb. 28 decision that local governments may be sued
successfully for monetary damages when ``deliberate indifference''
results in inadequately trained employees violating someone's
rights.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens dissented,
voting to leave intact the mother's legal victory.
   In the Los Angeles case, Sergio Alvarez Cabrales was jailed on
Oct. 27, 1983, on a burglary charge.
   On Dec. 16 of that year, he attempted to kill himself after he
was placed in a part of the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail
for the mentallly disturbed. He was saved when two guards caught
him about to leap from the top of the cell bars with blanket strips
tied around his neck.
   A prison psychiatrist said the suicide attempt was a ``gesture''
intended to convince authorities to put him back with the general
prison population.
   On Jan. 3, 1984, Cabrales _ then in isolation for fighting _ was
found dead, hanging from a towel rack in his cell with an ace
bandage around his neck.
   His mother, Josefina Cabrales, sued in federal court that said
the county and jail employees demonstrated ``deliberate
indifference'' to her son's medical and psychiatric needs.
   A jury in 1987 ruled that the county and Ronald Black, the
jail's director, violated Cabrales' rights. The county was ordered
to pay Mrs. Cabrales $150,000 and Black was ordered to pay $7,500.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling last
December.
   The appeals court rejected arguments by Black and county
officials that there was no proof they adopted a policy of
deliberate indifference to Cabrales.
   ``This contention misses the point,'' the appeals court said,
adding that there is no need to demonstrate an affirmative act of
deliberate indifference to prove a violation of an inmate's rights.
   ``The very notion of deliberate indifference connotes a regime
where neglect ... proves a constitutional violation,'' the appeals
court said.
   It said the jury properly could find Cabrales was denied access
to adequate care, noting there was evidence the undermanned
psychiatric staff spent only minutes per month with disturbed
inmates.
   The case is Los Angeles County vs. Cabrales, 88-1581.

   Merchants barricaded their shops
today and police guarded grocery stores after President Raul
Alfonsin declared a state of siege to stop looting by people driven
to desperation by the economy.
   More than 1,500 people have been arrested nationwide in five
days of unrest, according to reports from officials in major
cities. Many of the looters were women and children caught eating
in supermarkets and fleeing with food.
   At least three people were killed Monday during looting and
riots in the northern city of Rosario, the nation's third-largest
city and scene of the worst violence, the government news agency
Telam said.
   ``I had a shotgun and had prepared a system to electrify the
doors,'' one shopkeeper in Rosario, Pablo Davola, told the Noticias
Argentinas news agency. But when looters came in, ``there were many
people I knew, people from the neighborhood,'' he said.
   Police said about 750 people were arrested and 41 were injured
in Rosario. Another 500 were arrested in working class suburbs of
Buenos Aires.
   Alfonsin declared a 30-day state of siege Monday night. The
order suspends civil liberties in an attempt to end unrest by
people angered by soaring inflation, rising unemployment, a
devalued currency and shrunken wages.
   The Alfonsin government, which replaced a military dictatorship,
``had no alternative than this measure to preserve order and
guarantee the property and liberty of citizens,'' said Interior
Minister Juan Carlos Pugliese.
   Most of the capital's businesses were closed today and some
shopkeepers barricaded their stores. Schools, closed Monday,
remained shut, and public transportation was scarce.
   Two bombs exploded in Buenos Aires early today, but there were
no injuries.
   One destroyed the entrance of an office of the Radical Civic
Union Party, which was defeated in May 14 elections. Many have said
the defeat by the Peronists was because of the economic problems.
   The other bomb caused some damage outside a Communist Youth
Federation office.
   Argentina, rich in resources and once one of the world's
wealthiest nations, has been in steady decline for years. Many
trace the crisis back to the policies of former president Gen. Juan
Domingo Peron, who nationalized industries and expanded social
programs and public employment, allowing government to grow too big
after he was elected president in 1946.
   Things took a turn for the worse in February, when the Central
Bank stopped selling U.S. dollars to prop up the national currency,
the austral. Since then, it has been devalued by 90 percent against
the dollar.
   The country has a $59 billion foreign debt, and inflation hit
nearly 388 percent last year. Inflation this month may top 70
percent, which amounts to an annual rate of 58,162 percent.
Government austerity measures have added to the difficulties faced
by Argentina's people.
   It was the second uprising of its kind to strike a Latin
American nation in four months. In February, at least 276 people
died in Venezuela when rioting broke out over a government
austerity plan aimed at easing payments on the foreign debt.
   In the western city of Mendoza, where a supermarket was
firebombed Friday, several others were looted Monday. In Cordoba,
where 200 looters were arrested last week, there was a ``hunger
march.'' Cordoba is Argentina's second-largest city, Mendoza its
fourth-largest.
   Pugliese blamed the unrest on ``ultra-leftists ... who want to
cause anarchy.'' He cited the coordination of assaults, jamming of
police radio signals, and pamphlets urging Alfonsin to resign and
workers to strike.
   Leftist leaders denounced the state of siege and blamed the
disturbances on the failure of Alfonsin's economic policy.
   ``The way to calm people down is to grant an immediate salary
hike of 100 percent, index wages weekly, freeze prices and tell
businesses and stores _ on pain of confiscation _ to deliver
immediately food and medicine at the frozen prices,'' said deputy
Luis Zamora of the Movement Toward Socialism.
   The dead in Rosario were identified by police as Jose La Rosa,
47, shot in the neck by people firing from a passing car, Juana
Amelia Mazzi, 66, who suffered a heart attack during a melee at a
supermarket, and an unidenfied man shot at another supermarket.
   Under the state of siege, police may conduct raids without
obtaining warrants and make arrests without specific charges.
   President-elect Carlos Menem, who is due to take office on Dec.
10, backed the decree, saying ``this wave of confrontations, of
disturbances, of lootings must stop.''

   Italian conductor Giuseppe Patane
collapsed on stage during a performance of the Munich City Opera
and died today at a local hospital, officials said. He was 57.
   Patane apparently suffered a heart attack while conducting a new
arrangement of the opera ``The Barber of Seville,'' late Monday,
Bavarian Radio said in a statement released to other news media. He
was rushed to a local hospital where he died several hours later.
   Patane, who was chief conductor of the Bavarian Radio Orchestra,
regularly conducted performances of the City Opera. He also
frequently directed productions of the Bavarian National Theater.
   Patane, who was born in Naples, Italy on Jan. 1, 1932, began
playing piano at the age of six. He made his debut as a 19-year-old
conducter in Naples with a performance of Verdi's ``La Traviata.''
   Over the next 10 years he served as understudy to such renowned
conductors as Victor De Sabata, Antonio Guarnieri, Tullio Serafin
and Gabriele Santini.
   In 1961, Patane became the first Italian to conduct Richard
Wagner's ``Lohengrin'' at the Opera in Linz, Austria, and in 1962
he took over as conductor of the German Opera in Berlin.
   Patane's reputation as a master concert director later led him
to guest appearances in such halls as the La Scala in Milan, the
Vienna National Opera in Austria, and the Royal Covent Garden in
London.
   In 1970 he was named best Italian conductor, and in the
following years he was hailed for his guest appearances in San
Francisco, Chicago and at the New York Metropolitan.
   According to Bavarian Radio spokesman Rainer Tief, Patane knew
1,500 musical scores from memory, including 250 operas.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday outlined
a system of legislative oversight that would invest the full-time
legislature and national parliament with broad powers to change the
constitution, question government officials and review state
spending.
   He also said the new legislature, called the Supreme Soviet,
should create a commission that would act as a constitutional court
to ensure the transition to a nation ruled by law and respectful of
individual rights.
   The powers of the new part-time parliament _ the Congress of
People's Deputies _ and of the Supreme Soviet appear aimed at
creating expert, policy-making bodies independent of the Communist
Party bureaucrats who have run the country for decades and whom
Gorbachev blames for slowing his reforms.
   In his speech to the Congress, Gorbachev foresaw the following
powers for the 542-seat Supreme Soviet:
   _ Review of state economic plans and the budget.
   _ Review of appointments to key posts and ambassadorships.
   _ Calling government ministers to account for mistakes.
   _ Ratification of foreign treaties.
   _ Review of privileges for the elite.
   _ Keeping deputies in the 2,250-seat Congress informed of its
activities.
   _ Making and reviewing laws, while passing key legislation to
the Congress or even to the nation for confirmation or rejection by
referendum.
   Gorbachev said the aim of his reforms was to create a system
combining features of the soviets _ the councils set up after the
1917 Bolshevik Revolution _ with experience culled from Western
parliamentary systems.
   For this to work, he said, deputies must receive the practical
means to maintain contact with voters.
   However, he did not specify whether the deputies would be given
offices and full-time staff like members of Western legislatures,
nor did he say how much public access there would be to committee
reviews of economic and state policy.
   Many other details of the reform of the Soviet system, including
the makeup of the committee for constitutional compliance, or
constitutional court, as well as plans to delegate power to the
republics and self-governing regions, were only vaguely outlined by
Gorbachev.
   His speech was filled with a sense of caution instilled by
recognition of mistakes made in the reform effort, the work
involved in drafting or changing at least 50 comprehensive laws,
and the massive economic, ethnic and social woes of his country.
   Reformers such as Boris N. Yeltsin and sociologist Tatyana
Zaslavskaya pronounced the speech too cautious, saying more radical
solutions were needed.
   But some deputies immediately took up his call to question
government ministers and senior planners suspected of failing to
implement his economic reforms to date.
   Arkady P. Yanenko, head of the engineering institute in the
Siberian city of Novosibirsk, criticized the performance of the
Soviet government during the debate period that followed
Gorbachev's speech.
   ``Maybe there is an increase in supplies in the restaurant for
the State Committee of Statistics,'' he quipped, ``but they haven't
got down to us.''

   China's ``Wild Bunch'' rides no longer.
   A gang of 400 motorcyclists that roared through the streets of
Beijing in support of pro-democracy demonstrators is the latest
victim of a government crackdown on the protests, official media
reported Tuesday.
   Police arrested 11 leaders of the group who were accused of
disturbing public order, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
   ``The `Flying Tiger Brigade' that was arrogant for a while in
the capital has been broken,'' crowed the Beijing Daily, mouthpiece
of the city's Communist Party.
   The gang, also known as the ``Iron-Riding Guard Team,'' was a
huge hit with the hundreds of thousands of protesters who filled
Tiananmen Square earlier this month to demand a freer society.
   Beijing residents heartily cheered the motorcyclists as they
repeatedly zoomed around the square, exhaust flying and horns
honking.
   Local authorities, however, were not amused.
   According to the official media, the motorcyclists threw stones
and soft-drink bottles at soldiers sent to Beijing to enforce
martial law. They also smashed communications offices, ran off with
fuel from gasoline stations and incited workers to strike.
   A traffic cop who stuck out his hand to stop the gang at an
intersection was knifed in the palm, the Beijing Daily reported.
   The bikers shouted slogans and spread rumors ``to confuse and
poison the people's minds,'' and kept people from getting a
peaceful sleep, the reports said.
   ``According to initial investigations, the backbone elements of
the team included (people) released after serving a prison sentence
or after receiving juvenile delinquent re-education, rascal
ruffians, and idle businessmen and workers from private
enterprises,'' Xinhua quoted an unidentified police official as
saying.

   The Hofbraeuhaus brewery, which
supplies the famous beer hall of the same name in Munich, is
celebrating its 400th birthday this week.
   Bavarian Governor Max Streible will tap the first keg of brew
Thursday to begin four days of public festivities at Hofbraeuhaus
brewery in the Munich suburb of Riem, said company director Gerhard
Friedrich.
   Old-fashioned pulling contests between teams of oxen and horses
will also be among the attractions recalling Munich as it was when
the brewery began operating in 1589.
   The world famous Hofbraeuhaus beer hall in downtown Munich will
have to wait a few years to celebrate its 400th anniversary,
Friedrich said. That popular tourist attraction did not go into
operation until 1602, 13 years after the brewery.
   The brewery produces 3.5 million gallons of beer a year, about
one-fourth of which is exported to other countries, he said.

about $26,000 to each member involved.
   ``I don't usually play,'' Ms. Crowley said. ``Oh well, maybe
next time. But I'm really happy for all the people that did win.''
   The winning 16 include Chief Robert Lamb, Cmdr. Ed Fair, three

patrolmen, officials said.
   The winners were to present their winning ticket to Lottery
officials today in Chicago.

   About 200 Americans are quietly talking trade
with their Chinese counterparts this week amid student protesters
clamoring for democracy and political factions trying to purge
rivals they blame for the ``turmoil.''
   The 2nd U.S.-China Joint Session on Industry, Trade and Economic
Development opened Monday with far less fanfare than last year, but
participants said Tuesday they were undeterred by the political
troubles.
   ``There isn't any business uncertainty on the American side,''
said William Kinch, chairman of Grace China Ltd., a subsidiary of
the New York-based accounting firm W.R. Grace. ``The Chinese are
saying this will have no bearing on economic policy in the future.''
   Chinese participants ``have stressed the point that all sides to
the internal political debate are keeping the door open to the
West,'' said Washington attorney Michael Zacharia, former assistant
secretary for export administration in the Commerce Department.
   But the six-week pro-democracy student movement and the ensuing
power struggle among the Chinese leadership has cast a long shadow
over the conference.
   Last year, it opened in the Great Hall of the People, China's
seat of government, with a children's drum and cymbal corps
greeting 1,000 U.S. businesssmen and Premier Li Peng giving a
welcoming address.
   The Great Hall was ruled out this year _ the adjacent Tiananmen
Square is occupied by thousands of students, many demanding Li's
resignation for imposing martial law on Beijing to put down their
protests.
   The American side, organized by People to People International
Citizen Ambassador Program, of Spokane, Wash., decided to cancel an
``economic summit'' when it became obvious China's top leaders had
other things on their minds.
   A Chinese trade show had to be called off because exhibitors
from outside Beijing couldn't get their goods to the capital. A
special train arranged to take the Americans to other Chinese
cities was canceled, although regional visits will go ahead as
planned.
   Only about 200 Americans, mostly from small- and medium-sized
businesses, made the trip, well below original estimates.
   ``There was a lot of uncertainty among American delegates before
getting here,'' said People to People Chairman Norman Swanson,
adding he was ``impressed with the perseverance'' of those who
decided to come.
   Stephen E. Guisinger, a University of Texas professor who heads
the Joint Center for China-U.S. Management Studies, quoted one of
his fellow delegates as saying the political crisis was a ``stress
test'' for the Chinese.
   ``It's a good opportunity to see how China reacts under
stress,'' he said.
   Guisinger also argued it is inevitable that China adopt a more
open political system as it opens its economy to the outside world.
The current upheaval, he said, could have positive results.
   The Americans predicted U.S. investment in China will fall in
the short run, but blamed that more on an economic austerity policy
in effect since last fall to cool off the overheated economy and
bring down a 30 percent rate of inflation.
   Guisinger said Americans selling goods China badly needs or
negotiating long-term business links should have no problems, but
the businessman hoping to sell $100 million in computers in the
next two years is going to run into difficulties.

   The government is seeeking emergency food

   Deogratius Rwabita, deputy minister for relief and social
rehabilitation, said representatives in Uganda of two U.N.
agencies, the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture
Orgnization, were awaiting instructions from their Rome
headquarters.
   ``The little available food is extremely expensive and the local
people cannot afford the exorbitant prices,'' Rwabita said.
   He identified the affected areas as Arua and West Moyo
districts, 310 miles northwest of Kampala and near the borders with
Zaire and Sudan.
   Rwabita said the government recently sent 70 tons of corn and
beans to the people, who were mainly living on mangoes, water
lillies, and wild yams.
   Rwabita attributed the famine to a disease that destroyed the
tubular crop and to swarms of grasshoppers. A drought since January
has aggravated the situation.
   The only famine-related deaths reported so far involved a mother
and two children who died after apparently eating poisonous casava.
The father hanged himself when he found them.

   The effort by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to
name a successor ran into trouble Tuesday as two former leaders of
Japan refused to support his choice.
   In a meeting with Takeshita, former prime ministers Takeo Fukuda
and Zenko Suzuki suggested the posts of prime minister and
president of the governing Liberal Democratic Party be held by
different people _ a departure from party practice.
   ``There can only be one prime minister, but one or several
others should assume leadership of the party,'' Fukuda said after
the meeting.
   He said no single person can reverse the crisis caused by an
influence-peddling scandal that has forced Takeshita's resignation.
   Fukuda said Takeshita, who reportedly favors Foreign Minister
Sousuke Uno for both posts, promised to consider the proposal.
   The Liberal Democrats, who have ruled Japan since the party was
founded 34 years ago, have watched the the affair plunge party
popularity to unprecedented lows and fear sharp losses in summer
elections for half the upper house of parliament.
   Takeshita has indicated he hopes to leave office this week.
   But Uno's candidacy was challenged by senior leaders who say he
may not be able to win back public confidence because of his close
political ties to former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, under
whose 1982-87 tenure the scandal occurred. The outcry forced
Nakasone to resign from the party Sunday.
   The Executive Council, which sets Liberal Democratic policy,
Tuesday ordered measures to salvage the party's damaged image.
   It said profits from the scandal should be passed on to Japanese
society in an as-yet undefined way, and that members linked to the
affair should be denied government or party posts for an
unspecified period.
   The package left implementation of many reforms to each
politician's discretion.
   ``This is not going to satisfy the people,'' said governing
party legislator Tsuneo Suzuki.
   Osamu Yatabe of the Japan Socialist Party, who led the
parliamentary investigation into the scandal, asked: ``Who do you
think will welcome getting the dirty Recruit money back? The only
way to take responsibility is for all the politicians linked to the
scandal to retire from politics entirely.''
   Recruit Co., an information and publishing conglomerate, is
accused of seeking favors and influence through huge political
donations and bargain-priced share transactions.
   Seventeen people _ two legislators and the rest businessmen and
bureaucrats _ have been charged in the case.

<TEXT>
   A new political movement that wants to
keep Zimbabwe a multiparty democracy nominated a candidate Tuesday
for a July parliamentary by-election that will be its first test of
popular support.
   The outcome will indicate whether there is a significant
grassroots following for the fledgling Zimbabwe Unity Movement and
its campaign to stop President Robert Mugabe from establishing a
single-party state in one of Africa's few Western-style democracies.
   Mugabe says he will create a one-party government next year by
winning all parliamentary seats. Of the 100 national assembly
legislators only two are in opposition: veteran nationalist
politician Edgar Tekere and businessman Goodson Sithole of the Rev.
Ndabaningi Sithole's splinter Zimbabwe African National Union.
   At the Nomination Court on Tuesday, Harare City Councillor
Ephraim Masawi gave notice he will represent the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union (Patriotic Front). Businessman Fibion
Mutikori put forward his name for the Unity Movement. They are
contesting the eastern constituency of Dzivaresekwa.
   Tekere, 52, formed the Unity Movement on April 30 after he was
dismissed from the party for denouncing widespread top-level
corruption and accusing party leaders of cultivating a personality
cult around Mugabe. Tekere helped found Mugabe's party in 1963 and
was a member of its policy-making Politburo. He has promised an
honest, democratic and efficient government, and said he will mount
the first challenge to the presidency in national elections to be
held by April 1990 _ the 10th anniversary of Zimbabwe's
independence from Britain.
   Mugabe, who helped fight a bloody seven-year war that led
white-ruled Rhodesia to independence as Zimbabwe, has labeled
Tekere's party ``the joke of the year.''
   But the dissenting nationalist insists he has broad support from
students, labor leaders and peasants disenchanted with corruption,
record unemployment, commodity shortages and inflation.
   The by-election July 4-5 will fill a seat held by Maurice
Nyagumbo, the late senior minister for political affairs who
committed suicide in April after a judicial commission found he was
involved in a racket to buy motor vehicles from a state assembly
plant and sell them at bloated prices.
   Four other Cabinet ministers and a provincial governor resigned
after being linked to the worst scandal to plague Mugabe's
government.

   Villagers demanding that a U.S. Air
Force bombing range be closed scaled fences and stormed the range,
injuring 10 airmen, military officials said Tuesday.
   About 100 farmers and villagers attacked the Kooni range, about
70 miles southwest of Seoul, on Monday night, said Sgt. Will Baker,
an Air Force spokesman.
   The protesters assaulted military guards with clubs and rocks,
slightly injuring the airmen, he said. A Korean civilian worker
also was beaten, Baker said.
   He said Air Force personnel retreated to a dormitory after one
attacker pulled out a knife. The villagers then hurled rocks
through windows, he said.
   The protesters also damaged 22 military vehicles including
trucks, and looted and ransacked administrative buildings, Baker
said.
   About 450 South Korean riot police arrived about two hours after
the attack began and drove the protesters out, police said. Twenty
villagers were arrested, they said.
   The U.S. Air Force base in the central city of Osan dispatched a
team of 24 security police to the range by helicopter, but there
were no clashes between the security police and the attackers, Air
Force officials said.
   The attack came after villagers were stopped for safety reasons
from working in fields on the edge of the range during a bombing
practice, officials said. Farmers are allowed to use government
land around the range.
   Air Force officials said the attack caused extensive damage, but
gave no figures. South Korean news reports put the damage at about
$250,000.
   Villagers who live near the bombing range have complained of
noise and danger from military jets conducting bombing practice.
   The U.S. Air Force began using the range at the end of the
1950-53 Korean War. The United States has about 43,000 troops in
South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   The attack did not appear to be related to calls by some
anti-government groups for the expulsion of U.S. forces from South
Korea.
   South Korean dissidents and radical students have staged violent
anti-U.S. protests to denounce the United States for supporting the
government of President Roh Tae-woo.

   Wooden bridges, long ago relegated to
picture postcard status, are making a comeback as engineers merge
today's technologies with the material of yesteryear.
   ``Wood is so commonplace,'' says John Crist, director of the
U.S. Forest Service Timber Bridge Program. ``It just hasn't been
sexy, like steel and concrete.''
   With deteriorating bridges on the increase and state and federal
highway funds being squeezed, timber is getting a new look from
engineers and government planners who for years have favored
concrete and steel.
   Crist and others say new designs for wood allow timber bridges
to support the same 40-ton trucks as concrete and steel. They also
claim wood will last longer, and is cheaper to build and maintain.
   But those who would make wood the product of choice must
overcome the fact that it has been dismissed as outdated for so
long.
   ``That's our toughest nut to crack. Most of our engineers in
this country have been trained in steel and concrete,'' Crist said.
   Timber bridges have long been used in the nation's most remote
areas, and Vermont's covered bridges have been in service for more
than a century. But state and local officials have shied away from
using timber in federally funded projects because federal standards
are geared to concrete and steel.
   ``What we've had is a whole lot of Cadillacs where Chevys and
Fords will do fine, simply because that's the way we can get these
funds,'' said Dennis Borchardt, a resource economist and executive
director of the George Aiken Research, Conservation and Development
area in Randolph.
   The campaign to bring back timber is being fueled by a $3.3
million federal program designed to construct 80 timber bridges in
30 states by next year.
   The goals behind the federal initiative are to expand the market
for less popular types of wood, stimulate the local economy and
eventually create standard timber bridge designs easy enough for
local road crews to construct, Crist said.
   To boost wood as the material of choice in Vermont, a
demonstration bridge is being built in Norwich, with completion
scheduled to coincide with a mid-June conference on timber bridges.
   Also this year, the state is sponsoring what officials say is
the first bridge design competition since 1889, when a jury chose a
design for the Harlem River Bridge in New York City, now called the
Washington Bridge.
   The state competition is intended to stimulate design proposals,
with an emphasis on the use of Vermont materials, for the hundreds
of town bridges that need to be replaced.
   Federal experts say as many as half the nation's 550,000 bridges
are deficient in some way. Supporters of timber bridges say most of
those are short to medium spans, many of which would be suited for
timber.
   The bridge in Norwich in eastern Vermont uses one of the newest
construction methods, known as stressed deck construction, which
was developed in Canada when bridges made of wood glued together
began coming apart.
   The construction uses panels of wood with steel rods running
through them, and allows smaller trees to be used in building the
bridge.
   ``We don't have a lot of very large trees left any more, if we
want to cross a 75-foot river we have to find other ways to do
it,'' said Barry Dickson, a timber bridge engineer.
   For some of those involved in the new bridge projects, the most
compelling argument for returning to wood is not its cost or
availability. It is wood's beauty.
   ``In the middle of the national forest, it would be nice not to
have steel and concrete,'' said Jim Moore of New Hampshire's
municipal highway division.

   Officials using sonar today detected what
appear to be two vehicles in a turbulent river where a one-lane,
temporary bridge collapsed last week, the Hamilton County sheriff
said.
   Four people are believed missing as a result of the collapse of
the bridge over the Great Miami River on Friday, said Sheriff Simon
Leis Jr.
   But Leis said the current was still too swift to send in divers
today. They might not be able to enter the river, seven miles west
of Cincinnati, until Thursday, he said.
   A sheriff's department boat equipped with sonar found what they
believe are two vehicles near the bridge, Leis said. Seven boats
and a helicopter searched the river.
   Officials haven't been able to determine how many people died in
the collapse. They had thought a car and a van were swept into the
river, but Leis said the people in the van have since turned up.
   Two women from nearby Green Township, riding together in a car,
were still missing today. They had not come home since Friday
night, said Col. Ramon Hoffbauer of the sheriff's department.
   In addition, Leis said, two other people also were missing.
   The water level has dropped below 12 feet from a high Friday
night of 23 feet, seven feet above flood stage.
   The temporary bridge, located next to a permanent span still
under construction, opened to traffic Dec. 15. The new bridge is to
replace a 94-year-old structure.
   Officials said the combination of the river's current and the
pounding from water-borne debris probably caused the collapse.
Hamilton County engineers said they won't begin their investigation
until the river falls and the current slows.
   The National Transportation Safety Board joined the
investigation Monday, spokesman Alan Pollock said.

   In the last two weeks, at least 4,000
refugee families left camps in Pakistan and Iran and returned to
their war-devastated homeland, the government said Tuesday.
   Refugees were returning mainly to the western province of Herat
and the southern provinces of Kandahar, Nangahar and Logar, said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani.
   Pakistan-based guerrillas were using force in some cases to
prevent more refugees from returning, Amani said.
   ``Without the refugees the guerrillas have nothing,'' he said.
   An estimated one-third of Afghanistan's 15 million population
fled the 11-year-old insurgency against the Soviet-backed communist
government headed by President Najib.
   Refugees have started to trickle back since Soviet troops left
Afghanistan on Feb. 15, ending a nine-year intervention.
   Najib on Monday appealed for refugees to return home and help
rebuild the country devastated by a decade of war.
   ``Now the peace march is starting. We open our doors to you. We
will share our bread with you,'' he said in a speech broadcast on
government-run television and radio.
   In 1987, Najib announced a ``national reconciliation'' and
offered enticements to the 5 million refugees, including returning
property, granting them special loans and a six-month exemption
from military service. By official count, 200,000 refugees have
responded to the offer.
   There are deterrents to the return of families to their
villages, most which are under guerrilla control. Refugees fear the
continuing war and land mines, millions of which were placed
throughout the country.
   In a related development, Amani said government forces
recaptured the garrison of Samahkel in Jalalabad, which has been
under guerrilla attack since March. The garrison fell to the rebels
early in the siege.
   Amani also said the government forces pushed the guerrillas 15
miles from the city.
   The government claims could not be independently verified but
air activity and missiles launched from the capital toward
Jalalabad indicated fighting continued.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate
the murder convictions and life sentence of a South Dakota man
accused of murdering two men in Codington County 17 years ago.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a South Dakota Supreme
Court ruling that Steven Satter's statements to a county sheriff
were inadmissible because his rights were not read to him prior to
questioning.
   Satter was convicted of the Aug. 20, 1972 shooting deaths of
Kent Engle and Jerry Bowling at their trailer home near Pelican
Lake. At his trial, Satter contended he had acted in self-defense.
   The two victims' bodies were not located until April 2, 1973,
after Satter, then in the Codington County Jail on burglary
charges, directed Sheriff Curtis Berg to a rockpile along an
abandoned railroad track south of Kranzburg.
   At Satter's trial, Berg testified that he had received an
anonymous telephone call the day before his conversation with
Satter. The caller identified where the bodies were located and
indicated that Satter might be involved.
   After looking for the bodies unsuccessfully, Berg went back to
the jail and questioned Satter, initially about some burglaries in
the area and then about the missing bodies.
   Berg testified that he did not tell Satter before questioning
him about his right to remain silent or have a lawyer's help, nor
warn him that anything he said could be used against him.
   The South Dakota Supreme Court last Jan. 4 threw out Satter's
conviction, ruling that his April 2 statement to Berg should have
been excluded from his trial. The state court also ordered a
pretrial hearing to determine whether later statements Satter made,
after receiving Miranda warnings, are admissible. A circuit judge
will rule on whether Satter is entitled to a new trial.
   The state court also ordered a pretrial hearing to determine
whether statements Satter made to police after his April 2 remarks
to Berg _ all after receiving so-called Miranda warnings _ are
admissible as evidence.
   In the appeal acted on today, state Attorney General Roger
Tellinghuisen relied heavily on a 1985 decision by the nation's
highest court.
   In it, the justices said a criminal suspect's confession to
police given after he was advised of his so-called Miranda rights
may be used as trial evidence even though an earlier confession was
obtained without such warnings.
   Tellinghuisen told the justices that the statements Satter made
to police after April 2 should are admissible under the 1985 ruling.
   The attorney general added that because those statements were
admissible at Satter's first trial, the use of his unlawfully
obtained April 2 argument should have been ruled ``harmless error.''
   The case is Rist vs. Satter, 88-1661.

   Asked about U.S. government funding for opposition candidates,
Boucher noted that Congress authorized $1 million annually for the

   The people of Burma, whose own dreams
of democracy were crushed brutally a year ago, are finding new
inspiration in the student uprising in neighboring China.
   The Burmese government's response to protest was much harsher
than China's has been. Soldiers opened fire on crowds of peaceful
demonstrators, killing thousands.
   In September, the military banned all protest.
   About a dozen students defied the ban Thursday and rallied
outside the Rangoon University campus, shouting slogans in support
of the Chinese protest, a Western diplomat reported from the
Burmese capital.
   Tin Oo, chairman of the National League for Democracy, the main
Burmese opposition party, said the next day that police detained
six activists who stuck posters to trees in solidarity with the
Chinese. He said the six had sought legal advice from him.
   Moe Thi Zun, a 24-year-old student leader, said: ``At least the
Chinese government has some respect for the students. In Burma, the
students are just shot down in the streets.''
   He was among those who fled to the Thai border when Burmese
authorities began arresting students who organized demonstrations
in March and April 1988.
   Just as in China this spring, millions of people followed
Burmese university students into the streets, marching and shouting
for an end to more than a quarter-century of repression. They
forced the resignations of three presidents and ended one-party
rule, but the army still runs the country.
   Before leaving Burma, Moe Thi Zun led the Democratic Party for a
New Society, the main student political party.
   At rallies this month, Aung San Suu Kyi, co-leader with Tin Oo
of the National League for Democracy, contrasted the Chinese
attitude with the refusal by Burmese authorities to have any
contact with dissidents. She is campaigning for general elections
the government has promised to hold in May 1990.
   Tin Oo said by telephone from Rangoon: ``We started with a
student movement so everyone has strong feelings for what is
happening in China.'' His reference was to a tradition of student
activism that began with the period leading up to independence from
Great Britain in 1948.
   The official press has printed nothing about developments in
China and the government has made no comment. For information,
Burmese listen to the British Broadcasting Corp. and Voice of
America.
   Events in China have boosted morale among about 3,000 students
who remain in the border area, living in harsh jungle conditions
with ethnic rebels groups who have spent 40 years fighting for
autonomy.
   ``It makes them realize they are not alone,'' Moe Thi Zun said
in an interview. ``They can see there are people like them
struggling for democracy.''
   He said many Burmese students are disturbed by the decline in
news coverage of their struggle.
   ``It is particularly sad because the students in Burma went
through even greater hardships than those in China,'' he said.
``Now it is not worthy of page one even though there are many still
suffering.''

<HEAD>New Home Sales Increase in April</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes were up a strong 10.9
percent in April, the government said Tuesday, but housing
economists say the industry will remain on the downside at least
into summer because of high interest rates.
   The increase in sales to 620,000 units on a seasonally adjusted
annual basis was due to an aberration in sales in February and
March, when they dropped 10.9 percent and 10.4 percent, the
economists said.
   The April increase was the steepest since a 13.9 percent jump in
February 1988.
   Analysts were divided over how soon the housing market would
pick up.
   ``We view the market tone as generally weakening,'' said David
Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home
Builders.
   ``We're looking for further weakening in certainly the third
quarter, perhaps the fourth as well,'' he said.
   But Richard Peach, deputy chief economist for the Mortgage
Bankers Association, said that while the industry ``still is in a
slowing trend,'' the second quarter will be the ``trough.''
   ``As lower intrest rates kick in, sales will increase as the
summer goes on,'' Peach said.
   Fixed-rate mortgage interest reached a peak of 11.22 percent in
March and began to drop in April, averaging between 10.99 percent
and 11.11 percent, according to a weekly national survey by the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Rates had been rising for over a year as the Federal Reserve
tightened credit in an attempt to stem inflation.
   David W. Berson, chief economist for the Federal National
Mortgage Association, said he, too, thinks housing activity will
increase as mortgage rates continue to fall.
   ``We don't expect a tremendous surge in housing activity but we
do expect it to bounce back a little bit from the levels we saw in
February and March,'' he said. ``We're likely to see new home sales
between 600,000 and 650,000 (on a seasonally adjusted annual basis)
over the next several months.''
   The April sales level compares with new home purchases totaling
676,000 in 1988 and 671,000 in 1987.
   John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of
Realtors, also sees a slight pickup in sales activity later this
year.
   ``We anticipate new home sales will pick up slightly during the
second half of 1989, ending the year with a sales total of about
640,000,'' he said.
   The West paced the April rebound with a 31.3 percent increase in
sales to 193,000. It was followed by a 21.2 percent jump to 234,000
units in the South.
   Sales fell 6.8 percent to 96,000 homes in the Midwest and 17.2
percent, also to 96,000, in the Northeast.
   The falloff in sales in the Northeast, where housing costs
generally are highest, was the major cause for a $9,000 drop in the
median price of homes to $117,000 last month, the analysts said.
   It was the first median-price decline since a $2,500 decrease
last November. The median price represents the level where half of
the homes cost more and half less.
   The average price, which is affected by sales of expensive
homes, totaled $145,700 in April, down $4,800 from the previous
month.

<HEAD>No Prosecutions in 1987 London Subway Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of public prosecutions said Tuesday
he has decided against prosecuting subway officials for an
escalator fire that killed 31 people, a ruling deplored by victims'
relatives and a firefighters' union.
   Allan Green, in charge of prosecutions brought by the police,
said he had insufficient evidence to bring charges of manslaughter
or endangering life by neglect.
   The case has been turned over to the Health and Safety
Executive, a regulatory body, for possible legal action, Green said.
   An official report blamed executive complacency and an untrained
staff response for the Nov. 18, 1987, fire that erupted in busy
King's Cross station during the evening rush hour.
   A lighted match falling through a gap in escalator treads
ignited grease and debris on the escalator tracks and funneled
flames upward to a ticketing plaza that became an inferno.
   ``I am not surprised by this decision but I am bitterly
disappointed,'' said the Fire Brigades Union's national officer,
Dave Matthews.
   ``Once again it shows that eminent people in positions of power
and on good salaries seem on occasions to be beyond the law,'' he
said. ``How they can come up with such a finding when 31 people
lost their lives is unacceptable.''
   Sophie Tarassenko, whose brother, Ivan, was killed, said that
``after such a catastrophe of this scale it does seem astonishing
that corporate responsibility will not be acknowledged through a
prosecution.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush and the Western allies
hammered out a last-minute compromise over nuclear missiles today
and ended unity-minded NATO summit talks pledging ``to shape a new
political order of peace in Europe.''
   Bush urged Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to accept his
challenge to intensify negotiations on reducing conventional NATO
and Warsaw Pact forces. ``I have reason to believe that he knows
we've been serious,'' Bush said.
   The president said he hoped Gorbachev will be persuaded by the
``unity of the alliance'' behind Bush's proposals for lowering
troop levels to 275,000 on each side and negotiating new ceilings
for tanks, aircraft and other conventional weapons on the European
continent.
   Bush said his goal was to ``finally free Europe from the
constant threat of a surprise attack and the shadow of Soviet
military power.'' And as an inducement to Gorbachev, he said his
arms proposals ``should save him a lot of money in the long run.''
   ``I think it's a good thing, it's good for NATO, I happen to
think it's good for the entire free world,'' Bush told a televised
post-summit news conference before he flew to Bonn for further
talks with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   During a 30-minute session, Kohl thanked Bush for resolving the
dispute over short-range weapons that had threatened to disrupt the
summit and hailed the compromise plan as a move that ``shows
inspiration emanating from the leadership of the United States.''
   ``Mr. President, it was a wise and right decision at a very
important point in time,'' Kohl said during a brief exchange with
reporters following the meeting.
   The president said the United States is ``very pleased with the
reaction to the NATO decision taken.''
   Bush said Secretary of State James A. Baker III had told Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that the United States was
interested in a superpower summit before the end of the year.
   ``If there was something constructive to come out of such a
meeting, I would certainly be prepared to meet and I believe that
Secretary Baker has conveyed that to Minister Shevardnadze,'' Bush
said.
   Baker said in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America''
show that plans for a Bush-Gorbachev summit will depend on the
Soviet leadership's reaction to the president's latest proposals.
   The 16 summit leaders disposed of a potentially disruptive issue
by embracing a compromise formula for U.S.-Soviet negotiations on
reducing _ but not eliminating _ short-range nuclear weapons. Bush
told reporters he would never accept a nuclear-free Europe.
   Then, in a final communique ending their two-day talks, the
allied leaders acknowledged Bush's goal of completing East-West
negotiations on reducing conventional arms within the next year.
   Arriving in Paris for a human rights conference, Shevardnadze
said the Bush proposals were ``attractive'' and ``a step in the
right direction.'' But he said ``it will take time to examine the
American proposals in detail and determine the position of the
U.S.S.R.''
   The summit leaders also welcomed widespread changes under way in
the Soviet Union and East Europe, initiated by Gorbachev's reform
policies.
   ``The possibilities for fruitful dialogue have significantly
improved in recent years,'' they said. ``The allies are resolved to
grasp this opportunity.''
   The allies said attainment of lasting peace ``will require that
the unnatural division of Europe, and particularly of Germany, be
overcome.''
   In a separate declaration, the summiteers said: ``We want to
overcome the painful division of Europe, which we have never
accepted. We want to move beyond the postwar period.'' They said
they wanted to ``shape a new political order of peace in Europe.''
   The missile agreement was endorsed by the United States, Britain
and West Germany, key antagonists in the dispute, and NATO
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner credited Bush for summit's happy
ending. ``His leadership set the tone for the whole meeting,''
Woerner said.
   The agreement, drafted after eight hours of intense bargaining
by NATO foreign ministers, authorizes the United States to begin
negotiations with the Soviets ``to achieve a partial reduction'' of
short-range nuclear missiles once implementation of a conventional
arms agreement begins.
   The word ``partial'' was underlined, presumably at the
insistence of the British, who had vehemently opposed a West German
preference for negotiations to eliminate all such missiles.
   Kohl couldn't resist taking a few jabs at British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, his chief adversary in the missile dispute.
   ``Margaret Thatcher stood up for her interests, in her
temperamental way,'' Kohl amid laughter from reporters. ``We do
sometimes have differences of opinion. We have different
temperaments. And she's a woman and I'm not.''
   Praising Bush's leadership, Mrs. Thatcher said she was ``very,
very satisfied'' with the missile agreement. As for the West
Germans, she said, ``it is all written there very firmly indeed
and, wriggle as they may, that is what they have all signed up
for.''
   At the final summit session, Bush declared that ``a strong
Europe means a strong America,'' and that U.S. troops would remain
on European soil as long as needed.
   The missile issue once threatened to disrupt the summit
celebration of NATO's 40th anniversary, but harmony was assured
when West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher gave up
his fight for negotiating a total missile ban.
   ``It's a success,'' Genscher said.
   Under the compromise, NATO will delay until 1992 a vote on
whether to modernize Lance tactical nuclear weapons ``in light of
overall security developments.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush regarded
the summit as ``a very decisive and historic turning point for the
NATO alliance.''
   The post-midnight missile accord was the second major
achievement of the two-day summit. On Monday, President Bush
proposed, and the allies endorsed, a plan for cutting American and
Soviet combat troops in Europe to 275,000 on each side.
   Bush and Kohl had represented opposing camps in the quarrel over
short-range nuclear missiles. The compromise, which the White House
said was crafted primarily by Baker, was written to allow each
leader to claim a partial victory.
   ``We're very satisfied,'' Kohl told reporters as he entered NATO
headquarters this morning for the final summit session. Asked how
the agreement was reached, Bush replied, ``Very carefully.''
   British sources said Mrs. Thatcher had abandoned her effort to
have the final agreement include a ``reservation'' explicitly
forbidding a negotiated elimination of all tactical nuclear weapons.
   These sources said Mrs. Thatcher was pleased that the agreement
would allow negotiators to reduce _ but not eliminate _ the NATO
and Warsaw Pact short-range missiles. The compromise, reached after
eight hours of bargaining, ``was a very good outcome,'' said one
British source. ``Our position is now safeguarded.''
   The cutbacks would be linked to the East-West talks in Vienna to
reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other conventional weapons. The
missile negotiations could not begin until an accord was reached to
reduce those conventional forces and the two alliances had actually
started to carry out those cutbacks.
   And the nuclear cutbacks could not start until the conventional
cuts were finished, said the U.S. official.
   For Bonn, the agreement puts the alliance in favor of eventual
missile negotiations if certain conditions are met. Washington and
London had opposed such talks.
   For Washington, the language ensures that negotiations would not
start in the near future and would be tied to large Soviet cutbacks
in conventional arms. Moreover, it provides only for partial
reductions, not the total elimination of the weapons.
   The draft communique sidesteps another contentious issue by
calling for keeping the missiles up to date, but not specifically
saying when they should be modernized.
   The United States and Britain want to more than triple the range
of 88 U.S.-built Lance launchers to just under 300 miles, while the
West Germans opposed making the weapons more powerful.

   Disease killed 48 children this month
in evacuation centers after 35,000 villagers fled their homes to
escape fighting between government troops and communist rebels,
officials said Tuesday.
   Dr. Carlos de la Rama, health officer of Negros Occidental
province, said most of the children died of diarrhea and pneumonia.
Another 4,500 children were suffering from measles, stomach
diseases and malnutrition.
   The villagers began fleeing their homes in April after the
military stepped up operations against the New People's Army on
Negros Island, about 300 miles south of Manila, officials said.
   The military claims at least 42 rebels were killed in clashes.
   Officials said the evacuees had begun to return home after the
military promised to keep them from getting caught in the crossfire.
   Lourdes Cuachon of the Philippine Red Cross said her office
distributed rice, oil and soap to families who have moved back for
the planting season.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said 130,000 people
were driven from their homes in 1988 because of insurgency violence.

<TEXT>
   Burma's military government has changed
the country's official name to reflect its ethnic diversity, a move
apparently aimed at cooling unrest, a diplomatic source said.
   A military spokesman announced last week that the official name,
``Union of Burma,'' was being changed to the ``Union of Myanma'' to
reflect that there are other ethnic groups beside the Burmese
majority, a Western diplomat in Rangoon said.
   For four decades, a dozen ethnic guerrilla groups controlling
vast rural areas have been fighting for greater autonomy from the
government.
   Last year, the government dropped ``The Socialist Republic''
from the country's name to show its willingness to end a quarter
century of ruinous, rigid socialist policies.
   The diplomat, reached by telephone from Bangkok, said public
reaction to the announcement has been apathetic.
   The government has made a series of mostly superficial,
tentative changes in the economy and the political system since
millions of people marched in the streets nationwide last year to
demand democracy. The military ended the marches by shooting dead
thousands of peaceful demonstrators.
   A general election has been promised for May 1990, but
authorities have constantly harassed the main opposition party, the
National League for Democracy.
   The National Democratic Front guerrilla coalition combines 10
ethnic groups opposed to the government of Gen. Saw Maung and
claims to control half of Burma. The largest single guerrilla group
is the Karen National Union.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Deputy
Defense Secretary Donald Atwood have quietly visited the heavily
secured plant where the new B-2 bomber is being built, a spokesman
said Tuesday.
   Spokesman Pete Williams said Cheney and Atwood flew to and from
Palmdale, Calif., on Friday to inspect the first of the planes and
the Northrop Corp.'s production line.
   Cheney has proposed in the Pentagon's fiscal 1990 budget to slow
the pace of work on the stealth program pending a personal review
of the project's cost and progress. Including research and
development expenses, each of the 132 B-2s the Air Force wants to
buy would cost more than $500 million.
   Williams said Cheney has made no decisions about the program but
had promised Congress he would make an inspection trip a priority.
   The stealth bomber, designed to evade radar detection, was
publicly unveiled last fall and is expected to make its first
flight later this summer.

   Here are excerpts of the statement
issued by NATO at the conclusion of the two-day summit.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>INTRODUCTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The overriding objective of the alliance is to preserve peace in
freedom, to prevent war and to establish a just and lasting
peaceful order in Europe.
   ... The achievements of the lasting peaceful order which the
Allies seek will require that the unnatural division of Europe, and
particularly of Germany, be overcome, and that, as stated in the
Helsinki Final Act, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
all states and the right of peoples to self-determination be
respected and that the rights of all individuals, including their
right to political choice, be protected. ...
   The basic goal of the alliance's arms control policy is to
enhance security and stability at the lowest balanced level of
forces and armaments consistent with the requirements of the
strategy of deterrence.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>EAST-WEST RELATIONS AND ARMS CONTROL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Arms control alone cannot resolve longstanding political
differences between East and West nor guarantee a stable peace.
Nonetheless, achievement of the alliance's goal will require
substantial advances in arms control, as well as more fundamental
changes in political relations. Success in arms control, in
addition to enhancing military security, can encourage improvements
in the East-West political dialogue and thereby contribute to the
achievement of broader alliance objectives. ...
   In addition to agreements already reached, there has been
substantial progress in the START negotiations which are intended
to reduce radically strategic nuclear arsenals and eliminate
destabilizing offensive capabilities. ...
   There has also been substantial progress on other matters
important to the West. Soviet troops have left Afghanistan. There
has been movement toward the resolution of some, although not all,
of the remaining regional conflicts in which the Soviet Union is
involved. ...
   Prospects are now brighter than ever before for lasting,
qualitative improvements in the East-West relationship. There
continue to be clear signs of change in the internal and external
policies of the Soviet Union and of some of its Allies. ... At the
same time, serious concerns remain. The ambitious Soviet reform
program, which the Allies welcome, will take many years to
complete. Its success cannot be taken for granted given the
magnitude of the problems it faces and the resistance generated. ...
   The progress recently made in East-West relations has given new
impetus to the arms control process and has enhanced the
possibilities of achieving the alliance's arms control objectives,
which complement the other elements of the alliance's security
policy.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PRINCIPLES OF ALLIANCE SECURITY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Alliance security policy aims to preserve peace in freedom by
both political means and the maintenance of a military capability
sufficient to prevent war and to provide for effective defense. The
fact that the Alliance has for forty years safeguarded peace in
Europe bears witness to the success of this policy.
   Improved political relations and the progressive development of
cooperative structures between Eastern and Western countries are
important components of alliance policy. ...
   In underlining the importance of these facts for the formulation
of alliance policy, the Allies reaffirm that ... the search for
constructive dialogue and cooperation with the countries of the
East, including arms control and disarmament, is based on political
solidarity and adequate military strength.
   From its inception the alliance of Western democracies has been
defensive in purpose. This will remain so. None of our weapons will
ever be used except in self-defense. The alliance does not seek
military superiority nor will it ever do so. ...
   Consistent with the alliance's defensive character, its strategy
is one of deterrence. ... For the foreseeable future, deterrence
requires an appropriate mix of adequate and effective nuclear and
conventional forces which will continue to be kept up to date where
necessary; for it is only by their evident and perceived capability
for effective use that such forces and weapons deter.
   Within this overall framework, strategic nuclear forces provide
the ultimate guarantee of deterrence for the Allies. They must be
capable of inflicting unacceptable damage on an aggressor state
even after it has carried out a first strike. ... The strategic
nuclear forces of the United States provide the cornerstone of
deterrence for the Alliance as a whole.
   Nuclear forces below the strategic level provide an essential
political and military linkage between conventional and strategic
forces and, together with the presence of Canadian and the United
States forces in Europe, between the European and North American
members of the alliance. The Allies' sub-strategic nuclear forces
are not designed to compensate for conventional imbalances. ...
   All member countries of the Alliance strongly favor a
comprehensive, effectively verifiable, global ban on the
development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.
...
   The Allies are committed to maintaining only the minimum level
of forces necessary for their strategy of deterrence, taking into
account the threat. There is, however, a level of forces, both
nuclear and conventional, below which the credibility of deterrence
cannot be maintained. In particular, the Allies have always
recognized that the removal of all nuclear weapons from Europe
would critically undermine deterrence strategy and impair the
security of the alliance.
   The alliance's defense policy and its policy of arms control and
disarmament are complementary and have the same goal: to maintain
security at the lowest possible level of forces. There is no
contradiction between defense policy and arms control policy. ...
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT: PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Our vision for Europe is that of an undivided continent where
military forces only exist to prevent war and to ensure
self-defense, as has always been the case for the Allies, not for
the purpose of initiating aggression or for political or military
intimidation. Arms control can contribute to the realization of
that vision as an integral part of the Alliance's security policy
and of our overall approach to East-West relations.
   ... The Allies' arms control initiatives seek a balance at a
lower level of forces and armaments through negotiated agreements
and, as appropriate, unilateral actions, recognizing that arms
control agreements are only possible where the negotiating partners
share an interest in achieving a mutually satisfactory result. ...
</TEXT>
<NOTE>GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR ARMS CONTROL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Security: Arms control should enhance the security of all
Allies. Both during the implementation period and following
implementation, the Allies' strategy of deterrence and their
ability to defend themselves, must remain credible and effective.
...
   _Stability: Arms control measures should yield militarily
significant results that enhance stability. To promote stability,
arms control measures should reduce or eliminate those capabilities
which are most threatening to the alliance. ...
   _Verifiability: Effective and reliable verification is a
fundamental requirement for arms control agreements. ... Progress
in arms control should be measured against the record of compliance
with existing agreements. ...

<NOTE>ALLIANCE ARMS CONTROL OBJECTIVES</NOTE>

   The INF Agreement represents a milestone in the Allies' efforts

of all ranges. ...

<NOTE>STRATEGIC NUCLEAR FORCES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Allies fully support the U.S. objectives of achieving,
within the context of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, fifty
percent reductions in U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclear arms. ...
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SUB-STRATEGIC NUCLEAR FORCES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Allies are committed to maintaining only the minimum number
of nuclear weapons necessary to support their strategy of
deterrence. In line with this commitment, the members of the
integrated military structure have already made major unilateral
cuts in their sub-strategic nuclear armory. ...
   Major reductions in Warsaw Pact systems would be of overall
value to alliance security. One of the ways to achieve this aim
would be by tangible and verifiable reductions of American and
Soviet land-based nuclear missile systems of shorter range leading
to equal ceilings at lower levels.
   In view of the huge superiority of the Warsaw Pact in terms of
short-range nuclear missiles, the alliance calls upon the Soviet
Union to reduce unilaterally its short-range missile systems to the
current levels within the integrated military structure.
   The alliance reaffirms that at the negotiations on conventional
stability it pursues the objectives of:
   _ the establishment of a secure and stable balance of
conventional forces at lower levels;
   _ the elimination of disparities prejudicial to stability and
security; and
   _ the elimination as a matter of high priority of the capability
for launching surprise attack and for initiating large-scale
offensive action.
   ... The Alliance states that one of its highest priorities in
negotiations with the East is reaching an agreement on conventional
force reductions which would achieve the objectives above.
   ... The United States has expressed the hope that this could be
achieved within six to twelve months. Once implementation of such
an agreement is under way, the United States, in consultation with
the Allies concerned, is prepared to enter into negotiations to
achieve a PARTIAL reduction of American and Soviet land-based
missile forces of shorter range to equal and verifiable levels.
   With special reference to the Western proposals on CFE tabled in
Vienna, enhanced by the proposals by the United States at the May
1989 Summit, the Allies concerned proceed on the understanding that
negotiated reductions leading to a level below the existing level
of their SNF missiles will not be carried out until the results of
these negotiations have been implemented. Reductions of Warsaw Pact
SNF systems should be carried out before that date.
   ... The question concerning the introduction and deployment of a
follow-on system for the Lance will be dealt with in 1992 in the
light of overall security developments. While a decision for
national authorities, the Allies concerned recognize the value of
the continued funding by the United States of research and
development of a follow-on for the existing Lance short-range
missile, in order to preserve their options in this respect.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CONVENTIONAL FORCES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   As set out in the March 1988 Summit statement and in the
Alliance's November 1988 data initiative, the Soviet Union's
military presence in Europe, at a level far in excess of its needs
for self-defense, directly challenges our security as well as our
aspirations for a peaceful order in Europe. Such excessive force
levels create the risk of political intimidation or threatened
aggression. As long as they exist they present an obstacle to
better political relations between all states of Europe. ...
   In addressing these concerns, the Allies' primary objectives are
to establish a secure and stable balance of conventional forces in
Europe at lower levels, while at the same time creating greater
openness about military organization and activities in Europe.
   ... The outcome of the CFE negotiations would provide a
framework for determining the future alliance force structure
required to perform its fundamental task of preserving peace in
freedom. In addition, the Allies would be willing to contemplate
further steps to enhance stability and security if the immediate
CFE objectives are achieved _ for example, further reductions or
limitations of conventional armaments and equipment, or the
restructuring of armed forces to enhance defensive capabilities and
further reduce offensive capabilities.
   The Allies welcome the declared readiness of the Soviet Union
and other WTO members to reduce their forces and adjust them toward
a defense posture and await implementation of these measures. ...
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CHEMICAL WEAPONS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's chemical weapons stockpile poses a massive
threat. The Allies are committed to conclude, at the earliest date,
a worldwide, comprehensive and effectively verifiable ban on all
chemical weapons. ...
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CONCLUSIONS:</NOTE>
<NOTE>ARMS CONTROL AND DEFENSE INTERRELATIONSHIPS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   It is essential that defense and arms control objectives remain
in harmony in order to ensure their complementary contribution to
the goal of maintaining security at the lowest balanced level of
forces consistent with the requirements of the alliance strategy of
war prevention, acknowledging that changes in the threat, new
technologies, and new political opportunities affect options in
both fields. ...
   The current negotiations concerning strategic nuclear systems,
conventional forces and chemical weapons are, however, independent
of one another: the outcome of any one of these negotiations is not
contingent on progress in others. However, they can influence one
another: criteria established and agreements achieved in one area
of arms control may be relevant in other areas and hence facilitate
overall progress. ...
   Taken as a whole, the Allies' arms control agenda constitutes a
coherent and comprehensive approach to the enhancement of security
and stability. It is ambitious, but we are confident that _ with a
constructive response from the WTO states _ it can be fully
achieved in the coming years. In pursuing this goal, the alliance
recognizes that it cannot afford to build its security upon arms
control results expected in the future. The Allies will be
prepared, however, to draw appropriate consequences for their own
military posture as they make concrete progress through arms
control toward a significant reduction in the scale and quality of
the military threat they face. ...
   The Allies' vision for Europe is that of an undivided continent
where military forces only exist to prevent war and to ensure
self-defense; a continent which no longer lives in the shadow of
overwhelming military forces and from which the threat of war has
been removed; a continent where the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all states are respected and the rights of all
individuals, including their right of political choice, are
protected.
   This goal can only be reached by stages; it will require patient
and creative endeavor. The Allies are resolved to continue working
toward its attainment. The achievement of the Alliance's arms
control objectives would be a major contribution toward the
realization of its vision.

   A hometown girl upstaged contestants from
as far away as New York and Washington, played part of one song
with her elbow, and won the 15th Annual World Championship Old-Time
Piano Playing Contest.
   ``I'm in shock, that's all I can say,'' said Julie McClarey, 26.

   The city said it wasn't a conspiracy, but a
witness said he saw street workers changing one-way road signs near
the federal courthouse and meter maids writing tickets right behind
them.
   The violation: parking the wrong way against traffic, a $15
fine, $30 if it becomes delinquent.
   ``They gave a whole bunch of tickets out there,'' said Johnny
Miller, a security officer at the federal courts building.
   Miller said that before workers finished changing the signs on
both ends of two streets on April 19, parking officers started
issuing citations.
   Ida Daniel, head of the city parking division, said the streets
department did not tell her department there would be a change of
directions for the streets.
   ``It wasn't a conspiracy,'' Daniel said. ``If they (officers)
came behind them, it was purely a coincidence. The city doesn't
need revenue from parking tickets that bad.''
   The number of tickets issued on the two streets was not
available.
   Drivers who receive tickets in the city have the right to appeal
them by mail and, if they wish, in a traffic court hearing.

   The former Communist Party chief and military
commander of Soviet Georgia defended themselves Tuesday against
blistering accusations they ordered a fatal military assault on
demonstrators in Tbilisi.
   The debate over the April 9 military action against a
pro-independence demonstration in the Georgian capital aroused far
more passion among the 2,250 members of the Congress of People's
Deputies than President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy speech hours
earlier.
   Tamaz Gamkrelidze, director of Georgia's Institute of Eastern
Studies, won a round of stormy applause three times longer than
Gorbachev after a speech in which the Georgian demanded that Col.
Gen. Igor Rodionov, Caucasus military commander, be ousted from the
Congress for the assault.
   Half the Congress stood to applaud him.
   ``It is an insult to national feelings, the entire population of
our republic, that Col. Gen. Rodionov still sits in Moscow in the
Congress of People's Deputies,'' Gamkrelidze said.
   He said voters already had decided to recall the officer, and
added, ``Col. Gen. Rodionov does not have the political or moral
right to remain a people's deputy of the Soviet Union from
Georgia.''
   A Georgian report circulated at the session charged the military
with a ``planned mass massacre'' using clubs, shovels and chemical
substances against independence protesters who filled central
Tbilisi. Gamkrelidze's text closely followed much of that report.
   Taking the floor a few moments after Gamkrelidze, Rodionov
defended himself and his soldiers. He said the majority of Georgian
deputies had taken part in a Communist Party meeting April 8 that
approved the use of force.
   ``They supported the decision of the party bureau that the
situation was extraordinarily explosive, the outcome could not be
predicted, all measures of action and appeals to common sense had
been exhausted, and there remained only extreme measures, to use
force,'' he said.
   But after the violence, he said, everyone has denied being
responsible for using force.
   He said soldiers were armed with shovels only to protect
themselves, but that they did not expect ``such brutal and stubborn
resistance.''
   At least 19 people died in the clash with soldiers on Tbilisi's
Rustaveli Prospekt, and another was shot to death later that night.
   Sixteen of those who were killed outright were not marked with
wounds, he said. ``Not on one of them was there any wound from
puncture, cutting or bashing,'' he said, rejecting charges they had
been beaten with shovels and clubs, and suffered chemical poisoning.
   Rodionov denied using chemicals, and said the decision to send
in soldiers was made by such a small group of people that he
himself did not know when and how the assault was to take place.
   He was heckled, but also received long applause when he finished.
   After 80 minutes of impassioned debate, Gorbachev broke the
tension with humor and a promise that a parliamentary commission
would find those responsible.
   ``I've know this republic, these people for a long time,'' he
said of Georgia. ``They know me. I love them, and I hope they treat
me with respect.''
   Answering questions last week before the Congress, Gorbachev
said he only learned about the assault several hours after it
happened.
   ``We must get down to the roots, whatever this cost us and
whoever this might concern,'' he added. ``I was interrogated for
two hours yesterday. I am thankful to my comrades. This means that
there is democracy at the Congress. But this does not mean that
Gorbachev does not see. I see everything,'' he said to laughter and
applause.
   Dzhumber Patiashvili, the former Georgian Communist Party chief
who took responsibility for the assault and resigned, charged that
Rodionov and First Deputy Defense Minister Konsantin A. Kochetov
appeared at a party meeting and said they had been authorized
``from above'' to end the Georgian protests.
   He said that when he resigned, he did not know that chemicals
and shovels had been used. ``Even two or three days later, Rodionov
rejected the fact that shovels and gases had been used,''
Patiashvili said.
   ``I want to know who authorized the use of gas and shovels? Who
ordered this level of cruelty?'' he asked.
   After the debate, the deputies were invited to closed showings
of footage shot by Georgian activists and from the military about
events in Tbilisi.

<TEXT>
   U.S. sanctions threats against Japan are expected
to overshadow top-level talks on economic and monetary issues
starting Wednesday at the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development, participants said.
   It is the annual review of the world's economic health by
foreign and finance ministers of the 24 highly industrialized
nations that comprise the organization.
   Japanese officials angered at the Bush administration's decision
to single out their country as an unfair trading partner likely
will press their U.S. counterparts about the ``Super 301''
provision of the U.S. Trade Act. It allows the United States to
target countries officials believe are blocking American exports.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills met Tuesday with
Hiroshi Mitsutsuka, Japan's minister for international trade and
industry, and told a news conference she wants to ease the friction.
   Indicating some flexibility in the U.S. position, she said
dicussions with the Japanese do not necessarily have to take place
within the framework of the Super 301 provision and that she is
confident progress can be made.
   Mrs. Hills said she did not tell the Japanese she specifically
wants to negotiate under Super 301 _ a condition Japanese officials
have refused.
   ``I do want to talk about bringing down trade barriers and
streamlining multilateral trade,'' she said. ``I am ready to talk.''
   She said the only unilateral action the United States has taken
against Japan so far is to ``name priorities that we will discuss.''
   The U.S. delegation, led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
is expected to meet with Japanese participants Wednesday.
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno is leading Japanese officials, who
said they are determined to ensure the final communique of the
two-day meeting contains strong language that, while not mentioning
the United States by name, condemns unilateral trade protection
measures by Western industrialized countries. The officials spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Both the Japanese and the secretariat of the Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development fear the U.S. decision to
resort to bilateral negotiations with countries accused of unfair
trading practices could undermine the multilateral trading system
that has served the international community well during the 1970s
and 1980s.
   Japan is the only member of the organization to be put on notice
by the United States on May 25. Non-members warned were Brazil and
India.
   The United States said the three nations must lift unfair trade
barriers against U.S. goods or investments.
   Super 301 was passed by a Congress frustrated with a huge U.S.
trade deficit totaling nearly $120 billion in 1988.
   Delegates and officials of the organization's secretariat have
expressed concern that the trade dispute could push aside other
agenda items such as agricultural policies, the environment,
economic reforms and the debt problem.
   Participants said they anticipate tough talking about whether or
not the recent upward trend of inflation is temporary, since the
organization revised its inflation projections for industrialized
countries up half a point to 4.5 percent for both 1989 and 1990.

   A bungled armored truck holdup at a Wells
Fargo Bank branch today ended in a shootout that left seven people,
including five bank customers, wounded, officials said.
   The victims included a guard, five customers and the alleged
gunman; at least one of whom was reported in critical condition,
said fire department Inspector Ed Reed.
   ``One of the armored car service guards was taking a service
delivery back to his truck. There was an exchange of gunfire. The
guard was shot first,'' said Wes Lockwood, assistant vice president
of public relations for Wells Fargo.
   The bank had opened as usual at 9 a.m., he said, but closed
after the shooting so investigators could question employees and

   The military frequently criticizes the press
for reporting only ``bad news'' stories, ignoring all the good
things that happen inside today's armed forces.
   Tuesday, the Air Force made a point of offering a ``good news''
story _ and it really had to stretch to do so.
   Recall, first, that on May 11 the Air Force conducted the first
test flight of the new Midgetman long-range nuclear missile. The
missile had to be destroyed by a range safety officer when it went
out of control, apparently because of a second-stage rocket nozzle
malfunction.
   Tuesday, the Air Force issued a press release that began: ``The
Air Force announced today the first flight of the (Midgetman)
achieved almost 85 percent of its mission objectives, instead of
the previously announced 50 percent.''
   It seems that staying up in the air is only 15 percent of the
objective.

   President Bush told U.S. students
Tuesday that western values of democracy and freedom ``are winning
the battle around the world'' as he concluded his NATO summit visit
with a stop at an American school.
   ``As we look at Eastern Europe and we look at other places
around the world we see that it's the American values that are
prevailing,'' Bush told about 500 high school students at the
Brussels American School.
   The president and his wife, Barbara, spent about 20 minutes at
the school, located on the outskirts of the city, before leaving
for West Germany, the next stop on their European trip.
   The flag-waving students greeted the couple with cheers and
applause.
   ``I love this enthusiasm ... Anything to get out of school,''
joked the president after the cheering had died down.
   In his remarks, Bush only mentioned the NATO summit briefly,
saying: ``One of the things that has been marvelous about this
summit is the understanding that our values, the alliance's values
... are winning the battle around the world.''
   On a lighter note, he read two welcome cards from elementary
school students.
   One began: ``Yo, President Bush. I think you are really cool.''
   Looking up from the card to say, ``I want the press to hear
this,'' Bush then continued reading:
   ``You make all the right decisions. And I am glad you are coming
to our school. I love your hair.''

   The NATO allies argued bitterly,
antagonists yielded ground, and when they finally struck a deal on
short-range nuclear missiles in Europe everyone claimed victory.
   But two arch-rivals in the dispute, British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, did not
forgive and forget.
   He called her ``tempermental.'' She said pointedly that
``wriggle as they may,'' the West Germans cannot extricate
themselves from the accord that dashed their hopes of eliminating
the weapons on their soil.
   President Bush sided with Mrs. Thatcher on most of the issues
but ended up sounding more like a mediator than an antagonist. ``I
don't think we ought to have winners and losers,'' he said. ``It is
an alliance victory, an alliance decision.''
   Kohl, backed by several other leaders, and Mrs. Thatcher, Bush's
closest ally, each focused on the points they'd won and glided over
their concessions at the end of the two-day summit of the 16-nation
alliance.
   Mrs. Thatcher had wanted NATO to rule out superpower
negotiations to reduce the short-range Lance missiles and to pledge
to replace them in the mid-1990s when the weapons will be obsolete.
   Kohl, politically sensitive to widespread opposition in West
Germany to the missiles, wanted early and unconditional
negotiations.
   The last-minute agreement calls for the United States to
negotiate ``partial'' reductions, but only after conventional
forces are cut.
   ``Partial'' was underlined for emphasis. Mrs. Thatcher said that
wasn't her idea, but she liked it.
   ``I am very, very satisfied with the total document. It is one
of the best I have ever seen,'' Mrs. Thatcher said, noting that the
deal specified NATO will retain nuclear weapons.
   ``You don't have to ask me or them (the West Germans), just read
what they have signed up to,'' she told reporters. ``When you sign
up to something, that's that. It's not a question of what we say it
means.''
   Kohl, meanwhile, said the outcome of the summit was
``fantastic.'' It showed ``a positive recognition of our special
concerns'' by, he added pointedly, ``most'' of the allies.
   ``Margaret Thatcher stood up for her interests in her
temperamental way,'' Kohl said. ``We do sometimes have differences
of opinion. We have different temperaments. And she's a woman and
I'm not.''
   At her separate, but equally upbeat news conference, Mrs.
Thatcher responded in kind.
   Asked if she'd made up with the West Germans, she retorted, ``I
haven't started a battle with them. I don't have any problems. If
they have, let them sort them out.''
   She added, ``It's all written there very firmly indeed and,
wriggle as they may, that is what they have all signed up for.''
   The impetus for the agreement, reached after NATO foreign
ministers argued until the early hours Tuesday, was a Bush
initiative to accelerate conventional arms negotiations for new and
sweeping cuts in troops, armaments and warplanes in Europe.
   Everyone dubbed the Bush plan a winner, and the U.S. president
was credited with marking his first NATO summit by regaining the
arms control and public relations initiative from Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Kohl's backers, such as Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens,
and others who tried to intercede in the nuclear missile dispute
all claimed that they, too, were leaving Brussels contented.
   ``The total elimination of nuclear weapons cannot be expected in
the foreseeable future,'' said Italian foreign minister Giulio
Andreotti, one of the conciliators. Then he added, ``But no hope is
excluded.''

<HEAD>Federal Judge Ruled for General Electric While Holding GE Stock</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto MI2</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chief judge of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals said Tuesday he would begin a review of two cases in
which District Judge Thomas J. Curran ruled in favor of the General
Electric Co. while owning GE stock.
   The U.S. Code of Judicial Ethics forbids a judge from presiding
in a case in which he has a financial holding.
   The Associated Press discovered the incidents by reviewing
Curran's financial disclosure statements and cross-referencing his
stock holdings with his case files.
   In a telephone interview from Chicago, Appeals Judge William J.
Bauer said he had decided to begin a formal review after taking a
``cursory look'' at the AP finding. He said he would probe both
cases closely and then announce whether any action should be taken.
Federal statutes require confidentiality until formal action is
taken, Bauer said.
   Curran was on the bench Tuesday and could not be reached for
comment.
   In an interview Friday, Curran said he would ``notify counsel of
the existence of the conflicting interest'' and avoid future
involvement in cases involving GE.
   Judge Robert W. Warren, chief judge of the Eastern Wisconsin
district in Milwaukee, said Curran's ruling in GE cases apparently
``slipped through the cracks'' of a system designed to catch such
conflicts.
   ``Judge Curran, when he found out about this, has filed an order
recusing himself. ... It's not the kind of thing that we're happy
about. It will be repaired,'' Warren said.
   Curran reported in all his disclosure statements since 1985 that
he held between $15,000 and $50,000 in GE stock. He presided over
unrelated cases involving GE Medical Systems in 1987 and 1989 and
said in an interview that he was surprised to learn of the
conflicts.
   ``I really thought we had a system to prevent that,'' Curran
said. He said in accepting the cases, he hadn't recognized GE
Medical Systems as a ``subsidiary'' of GE. Actually, GE Medical
Systems is a division of the parent company, and in one case
Curran's ruling directly cited General Electric Co. as the
defendant.
   ``I couldn't dispute that,'' said Curran.
   Bauer originally reviewed the AP's findings without knowing the
judge's name and said the cases appeared to violate the U.S. Code.
Bauer is responsible for enforcing the judicial code of ethics on
all judges in his territory, which includes Wisconsin.
   ``The code is fairly clear,'' he said. ``If you have a financial
interest you must disqualify yourself.''
   University of Wisconsin law professor Frank Tuerkheimer, a
former U.S. attorney, said possible action against the judge could
range from a reprimand to impeachment, but the latter was ``highly
unlikely.'' He said neither suit was large enough to affect the
judge's investments, ``but the case law is clear that that does not
matter.''
   Curran, 64, is a former Mauston, Wis., attorney who was
appointed to the bench in 1983 by then-President Reagan. His 1988
disclosure showed net investments between $648,030 and $1,720,000,
generally in blue-chip stocks. His investments returned between
$37,147 and $112,116, including between $1,001 and $2,500 in GE
dividends.
   Curran's first case involving GE stemmed from a 1983 lawsuit
filed by a union representing Robert Holloway. The union contended
Holloway was unfairly denied a promotion at the GE Medical Systems
plant in West Milwaukee. There was a one-day trial in 1984, and
Curran dismissed the lawsuit June 5, 1987.
   His ruling listed General Electric Co. as the defendant.
   In the more recent case, Joseph Toth, another GE Medical Systems
employee, sued in 1988 contending he was unfairly fired for missing
work because of a health problem. On April 25, 1989, Curran denied
Toth's request for a trial, issuing a summary judgment dismissing
the lawsuit.
   The Toth case listed General Electric Medical Systems as the
defendant.
   ``You try to keep track of these subsidiaries,'' Curran said.
``Apparently in this case we didn't.''
   He added: ``Having been alerted, we will notify counsel of the
existence of the conflicting interest and recuse myself so I would
not be in a position to pass judgment upon anything further with
GE.''
   William E. Wentzel, who represented Toth, said Tuesday: ``I'm
certainly going to do something, whatever it takes to get the case
reopened.''
   Wentzel said he and the lawyer representing GE filed a joint
document in the Toth case prior to their first pre-trial hearing.
The summary of issues identified GE as the defendent, but Curran
never disclosed his holding, he said.
   Matthew R. Robbins, whose firm represented Holloway, said he
would contact his client, ``but I would have to suspect that past
due time would make an appeal unlikely.''
   Robbins said the discovery indicated a problem lawyers ``are not
aware of. You normally do not know ... the judges' financial
holdings.''
   George K. Whyte Jr., whose law firm represented GE in the
Holloway matter, said he could not recall the case. Mary Pat
Ninneman, who represented GE in the Toth case, did not return
several phone messages.
   Title 28 of the U.S. Code, section 455, requires that a judge
disqualify himself when ``he knows that he, individually or as a
fiduciary, or his spouse or his minor child residing in his
household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in
controversy or in a party to the proceeding.''
   The code defines financial interest as ``ownership of a legal or
equitable interest, however small.''
   Judge Warren said his district court has a ``certificate of
interest'' system designed to identify possible conflicts.
   ``The certificate does not always work because the defendant's
certificate isn't filed until after the case is assigned. .... This
application just slipped through the cracks.''
   ``About all I can say is it's unfortunate if it happened, but it
does happen because judges can't keep track of all their holdings
and their relationships to subsidiaries in this day and age.''

   The State Department called Tuesday on
Argentina's political and economic leaders to unite in formulating
a plan to ease the country's economic crisis.
   The statement by deputy spokesman Richard Boucher appeared to be
an appeal for government and opposition forces to revive their
effort to agree on economic measures.
   That effort broke down shortly after the Peronist candidate for
president, Carlos Menam, defeated the candidate of the ruling
Radical Party in national elections two weeks ago.
   Boucher expressed regret that the economic crisis has led to
disorder and said the state of siege instituted on Monday to halt
an outbreak of food riots was consistent with democratic procedures
established by the constitution.
   ``At this critical time, we believe it is important for
Argentina's political and economic leaders to work together to
implement measures to stabilize the economic situation,'' Boucher
said.
   He said the administration does not believe that the declaration
of a state of siege poses any danger to democracy.
   ``Despite serious economic problems, the people of Argentina
have made their commitment to democracy clear, most recently in the
election for president on May 14,'' he said.

<HEAD>Italian Conductor Patane Collapses During Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian conductor Giuseppe Patane,
who won rave reviews for his U.S. appearances in the 1970s, died
early Tuesday after collapsing onstage during a performance of the
Munich City Opera. He was 57.
   Patane apparently suffered a heart attack Monday night while
conducting a new arrangement of the opera, ``The Barber of
Seville.'' He was taken to a hospital, where he died.
   Patane, the principal conductor of the Bavarian Radio Orchestra,
regularly directed performances of the City Opera. He also led
performances at the Bavarian National Theater in Munich.
   Patane, who was born in Naples, Italy, on Jan. 1, 1932, began
playing piano at the age of six. He made his debut at 19,
conducting a Naples performance of Verdi's ``La Traviata.''
   In the next 10 years, he was understudy to such renowned Italian
conductors as Victor De Sabata, Antonio Guarnieri, Tullio Serafin
and Gabriele Santini.
   In 1961, Patane became the first Italian to conduct Richard
Wagner's ``Lohengrin'' in Linz, Austria, and in 1962 he became
conductor of the German Opera in Berlin.
   Patane's reputation led him to guest appearances in such famous
music halls as La Scala in Milan, the Vienna National Opera in
Austria, and the Royal Covent Garden in London.
   In 1970, he was named best Italian conductor, and in the
following years was hailed in appearances in San Francisco, Chicago
and at New York's Metropolitan Opera House.
   He knew 1,500 musical scores from memory, including 250 separate
operas, according to Bavarian Radio Orchestra spokesman Rainer Tief.

<BYLINE>Egg Industry Still Troubled Despite Good News On Cholesterol ^By

<TEXT>
   Egg industry leaders say it's too early to
tell whether good news on cholesterol from the government and
American Health Association will boost America's appetite for eggs
after decades of decline.
   Plagued by health worries, smaller breakfasts, droughts that
raised feed prices and losses that drove thousands of producers out
of business, egg farmers are faced with a new twist to an old
question.
   Instead of trying to figure out which came first, the chicken or
the egg, producers are debating which comes first now, advertising
or sales, after the best cholesterol reports the industry has
received in years.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture said two weeks ago it found
large eggs have 213 milligrams of dietary cholesterol, instead of
the 274 milligrams listed in government reports dating to 1976.
That led the AHA to raise from three to four its recommendation on
the maximum number of eggs a person should consume per week in a
low-cholesterol diet.
   But rather than kicking off a national campaign to spread the
word about the new guidelines or other health benefits, producers
either can't afford or are reluctant to spend on advertising. In
some cases, they don't even want to talk publicly.
   In California, which produces more eggs than any other state _
7.7 billion of the 69.5 billion eggs produced last year _ producers
don't want to talk with reporters after getting ``a bad rap for a
long time,'' said Robert Pierre, president of the California Egg
Commission.
   ``The egg industry has been in considerable financial difficulty
for a number of years and is unable to finance advertising at the
levels we want or need,'' said Louis B. Raffel, president of the
American Egg Board in Park Ridge, Ill. ``And I'd have to say (the
producers) have been a little late in realizing the achievements
they can get from advertising.''
   The national advertising budget is only $3 million for an
industry which last year had $3.1 billion in sales _ down from $4.1
billion in 1984.
   Meanwhile, the producers' biggest competitors, cereal makers,
spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually on advertising, said
Raffel.
   Egg producers have a 2{-cent checkoff for each dozen eggs to
finance national advertising, and are awaiting USDA approval for a
5-cent checkoff.
   Last year was ``an absolutely terrible year for producers,''
said Ken Klippen, vice president of United Egg Producers in
Atlanta. ``Farmers were losing money on every dozen eggs they were
producing'' as wholesale prices fluctuated from 50 cents to 75
cents a dozen.
   The drought raised the cost of feed ingredients, corn and
soybean meal, while consumption continued downward, Klippen said.
   The industry has lost money five years in this decade, including
$280 million in 1988, according to agricultural economist Lee
Schrader of Purdue University. This year, Schrader forecasts a
modest profit of $115 million on sales of $4 billion at the
wholesale level.
   The last good year for the industry was 1986, when it made 6.9
cents per dozen for a $400 million profit.
   The profits this year probably won't come as a result of the
cholesterol reports, Klippen said.
   ``It's too early to say what effects those reports will have,''
he said. ``They're very positive. We're trying to change the
perception of eggs (as high in cholesterol) but it's very
laborious, especially when the consumers are bombarded with
promotions of products that are `low in cholesterol' and
`cholesterol free.' Everybody hears this buzzword.''
   ``Undoubtedly the health issue has been a factor in some of the
decline in use of eggs, but it's very difficult to separate that
out of other factors, such as changing lifestyles,'' Schrader said.
``It's not clear what the issue has been. Changing cholesterol
levels are bound to have some impact, but not a large amount.''
   The consolidation of the industry nationally _ there are about
1,600 producers, down from 6,000 in 1979 _ may help the national
advertising effort, Raffel said.
   ``There are fewer producers to make understand the value of
advertising,'' he said. ``The larger ones are more sophisticated.''
   Despite consolidation and the decline in annual per capita
consumption from 278 eggs in 1979 to 242 eggs last year _ it was
321 eggs in 1960 when big breakfasts were still fashionable and
cholesterol wasn't a major concern _ the number of egg-laying hens
has remained fairly constant in recent years at about 235 million.

<TEXT>
   More than half of a suburban town's police force
stormed state lottery offices Tuesday, but they weren't after
criminals _ just their one-third share of a $25 million jackpot.
   Sixteen employees at the Barrington Hills Police Department
kicked in to buy 90 $1 tickets for Saturday's drawing. The other 12
employees are kicking themselves, said Chief Robert Lamb, who is
one of the winners.
   ``It's been like pandemonium,'' Lamb said from lottery
headquarters, where the department's winning Lotto ticket was
verified. ``The adrenaline is flowing.''
   The winners' share is $8.3 million, paid out in 20 annual
installments. After the first $416,811 check, they will split
$414,000 a year, said lottery spokeswoman Carrie Worley.
   That works out to about $26,000 annually for each player, Lamb
said _ not enough for early retirement but ``enough to make life a
little more comfortable for all of us.''
   In addition to Lamb, the winners include Cmdr. Ed Fair, three
sergeants, two dispatchers, a mintenance worker and eight
patrolmen, officials said.
   The Barrington Hills police headquarters was quiet Tuesday
morning.
   ``Just us losers are here today,'' said dispatcher Cindy Olhava.
``We're just moping around.''
   Plans for spending the windfall are still up in the air, but
some of the winners ``have little kids and are already planning for
college days,'' Lamb said.
   As far as splurging, ``there is talk of buying a condo in the
Gulf for us'' in Texas or Florida, he said.
   Too many members of the force won to allow all the winners to
take time off together, the chief said, but ``I'm sure there will
be a lot of vacation requests coming in now.''
   Mayor James A. Kempe wondered if there would be a rash of
resignations on the force serving his northwest suburban community
of about 3,000. ``I hope they stay on,'' he said.
   The pool was organized by Officer Michael Wisniewski, who said
he started playing with two employees who work with him on the
overnight shift.
   He figured that if the entire department got in on it, they'd
have more chances to win.
   The idea ``went like wildfire,'' said Wisniewski, who plans to
use his share to pay bills and for education for himself, his wife
and their children.
   Right now, he said he wants to catch up on his sleep. Wisniewski
estimated he'd slept about four hours since Saturday's drawing,
fretting that he'd misread the numbers.
   ``It couldn't sink in that we actually won,'' he said, adding he
feels ``kind of sad to see everybody didn't get into it.''
   Lotto players buy $1 tickets with two chances to pick six
numbers from 1 to 54. The winning numbers in the weekend drawing
were 4, 19, 24, 25, 38 and 43.

<HEAD>Gun-Waving Case Against Actor Rejected by Prosecutor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENTURA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Timothy Bottoms won't be charged
with waving a pistol at a motorist because it can't be proved the
weapon was displayed in an improper manner, a prosecutor said
Tuesday.
   ``He did have a gun, but he didn't display it in a rude, angry
or threatening manner as required,'' said Deputy District Attorney
Don Grant.
   Bottoms was booked for investigation of brandishing a gun on a
road, a felony, and carrying a loaded weapon, a misdemeanor, after
a motorist told the California Highway Patrol he was confronted by
the actor on U.S. 101 on May 10.
   The decision not to file charges against ``The Last Picture
Show'' actor was made last week, Grant said.
   ``The case was rejected by our office for the reason that, based
upon the facts in the case, we felt we couldn't prove it,'' the
prosecutor said.
   Bottoms had a .22-caliber pistol and ammunition in his station
wagon when it was pulled over by highway patrol officers, but the
weapon wasn't loaded, Grant said.
   The actor's spokesman, Sandy Bresler, has declined comment.
   Bottoms, 37, made his film debut in 1971 in the movie ``Johnny
Got His Gun,'' the same year he appeared in ``The Last Picture
Show.'' His other films include ``The Paper Chase'' in 1973 and
``Invaders From Mars'' in 1986.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II met Tuesday with Cardinal John
O'Connor for a briefing on the New York prelate's visit to Lebanon,
where he tried unsuccessfully to visit Americans held hostage.
   ``For the holy father to schedule an hour-and-a-half meeting on
the eve of his trip to Scandinavia, he must have been very
interested in hearing the cardinal's impressions,'' said Monsignor
James McCarthy, the cardinal's secretary.
   O'Connor traveled to Lebanon on Saturday in his capacity as head
of the Catholic Near East Welfare Mission and visited hospitals and
orphanages.
   He appealed during his three-day trip to see the nine American
hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists, but received no response
from the captors.
   In all, 18 foreigners are held hostage in Lebanon. The longest
held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   O'Connor arrived in Beirut a day after an Arab League summit
renewed its call for Christian troops fighting Syrian and Druse
forces to honor a cease-fire.
   The latest round of fighting in the 14-year-old civil war began
11 weeks ago, and has overshadowed the hostage issue.
   O'Connor planned to visit Moslem west Beirut but called off the
trip on Sunday because he was told there was a fighting along the
city's dividing Green Line.
   He said later the information was inaccurate, but declined to
say where it came from.
   ``It was the cardinal's decision not to go, based on a number of
different reports, influences, people and the predominant physical
danger of his going at that time,'' said McCarthy, who accompanied
O'Connor to Lebanon. He would not elaborate.
   The decision offended some Moslem leaders, including acting
Prime Minister Salim Hoss. The cardinal later spoke with Hoss by
telephone to try to patch things up.
   He also met with a representative of Shiite Moslem Parliament
Speaker Hussein Husseini, McCarthy said.
   O'Connor flew to Rome on Tuesday from Larnaca, Cyprus, after
staying in Lebanon's Christian enclave at Bkirki monastery as the
guest of Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir.
   Security at Larnaca airport was tight after police on Monday
found a cache of weapons near the beachside runway. They included
Soviet-made SA-7 shoulder-fired missiles, police said.
   Cypriot police arrested six Arabs suspected of planning to shoot
down Lebanese army helicopters that make daily flights from Cyprus
to the Christian enclave, under siege by shelling by Syrian forces.
   Government officials said the target was an ``Arab
personality,'' not O'Connor. They did not elaborate.

<HEAD>Permits to Hunt Alligators Accepted This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Applications for the state's second
alligator hunt in recent decades will be taken this week and
officials plan to open more areas and increase the number of gators
that can be taken.
   Last year was the first legal hunt in 26 years, with 2,960
alligators reported caught _ well under the 3,450 limit set the the
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   This year that limit will go up to 3,900 _ out of an estimated
population of 1 million gators _ and game officials are preparing
to receive up to 26,000 applications for the 250 or 260 permits to
be issued.
   ``There are still really dense populations of alligators that we
didn't really consider last year,'' said Mike Jennings, a wildlife
biologist with the Alligator Management Office in Gainesville.
   Applications will be taken beginning Thursday and will be
accepted until June 15, Jennings said. Permits to hunt the gators
will be awarded by lottery.
   Thirty-two areas, including Lake Okeechobee and parts of major
canals in Palm Beach and Broward counties, will be hunted this year.
   The dates for the hunting season have not been set, officials
said. Last year the season began in September.

   The 33-foot-tall ``Goddess of Democracy,''
unveiled Tuesday, is the latest in a long line of blasphemous
additions to Tiananmen Square by students demonstrating for
democracy.
   First the students made fun of soldiers, messing up their timed
march by yelling numbers out of sequence. Then they hung flags for
freedom from the roof of the Museum of Revolutionary History.
   Next came balloons floating atop the Monument for Revolutionary
Martyrs, a massive obelisk in the middle of the square. ``Meet our
demands,'' they read, as they bobbed in the wind.
   With the visit of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
students had their own welcoming ceremony _ 100,000-strong _
forcing the government to switch its ceremony to the airport.
   Last week, three people threw paint at the portrait of Chinese
leader Mao Tse-tung, covering it with blue, red and black dots, and
forcing authorities to replace the portrait of the Great Helmsman.
   On Tuesday, they put the ``Goddess'' _ a Statue of Liberty
lookalike _ in the middle of the vast expanse, the symbolic
political center of China.
   Fashioned from white Styrofoaom and plaster of Paris by students
from eight art schools around Beijing, the statue depicts a large
lady, hair blowing in the wind, holding a torch.
   Whereas the lady in New York Harbor holds a torch and a tablet,
China's version holds only a torch, in both hands, like a baseball
bat.
   Located smack on the Celestial Axis _ a line which runs from the
throne in the Forbidden City to the Temple of Heaven _ the statue
is a challenge, and some might say, an insult to China's imperial
and Communist tradition.
   The nightly TV news took a hard line on the statue.
   ``The people of the whole nation will resolutely oppose it,''
the news quoted a group called the Beijing Tiananmen Square
Administration as saying. ``The erection of a so-called `Goddess'
statue here is an insult to the national image and dignity.''
   A letter from an unidentified ``intellectual'' also was read.
   ``This is China, not America,'' he reminded the audience. ``But
even if it was America you wouldn't be able to build a so-called
statue in front of the Congress building.''
   He called the act ``illegal'' and asked the government to get
rid of the statue by Thursday. ``Otherwise there will be serious
unhealthy effects,'' he warned.
   For a government used to a monopoly on political symbols, the
statue's meanings must irk the leadership in several ways.
   The unwillingness of the builders to listen to the government's
warnings about the statue and the relish with which Beijing's
citizens treated its appearance must chafe.
   Indeed, although a hardline faction appears to be winning the
power struggle inside the halls of power, the statue proved that
for the time being the streets still belong to the people.
   On Tuesday, tens of thousands of people swarmed around the
statue, posing for pictures with the Goddess as a backdrop.
   ``This is not fine art,'' said a woman as she looked up at the
Goddess' face. ``But it is a symbol. It proves people want
freedom.''

   Soviet officials Tuesday welcomed a NATO proposal
to negotiate reductions in short-range nuclear missiles but said
linking the issue to talks on conventional arms could cause an
unneeded delay.
   A Soviet TV commentator said the NATO agreement had only papered
over differences between President Bush and a majority of the U.S.
allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance.
   The proposal, announced by Bush on Monday at the NATO conference
in Brussels, authorizes the United States to negotiate with the
Soviets ``to achieve a partial reduction'' of short-range nuclear
missiles.
   However, any missile reductions would be linked to East-West
talks in Vienna on reducing troops, tanks and artillery. The
missile negotiations could not begin until an accord was reached to
reduce those conventional forces and NATO and the Warsaw Pact had
actually started to carry out those reductions.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev did not comment on the proposal
in a major policy address Tuesday in which he disclosed that the
Kremlin spends about $118 billion a year for defense, nearly four
times the previous official claim.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said upon arriving in
Paris for a human rights conference that the proposal was
attractive and ``a step in the right direction.''
   But he said ``it will take time to examine the American
proposals in detail and determine the position of the U.S.S.R.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said in Moscow that
Soviet officials had not yet seen the proposals, but welcomed the
opportunity to negotiate a reduction in battlefield nuclear
missiles.
   ``Generally speaking, we are for such negotiations and against
linkage of such negotiations with other talks and negotiations,''
Gerasimov said.
   ``If the United States is going to postpone the negotiations on
tactical nuclear missiles until we have agreement on conventional
weapons and start reductions, then we think that it is a
protraction, a protraction that we don't need,'' he said.
   Gerasimov said negotiations should be able to move ahead in
several areas simultaneously.
   ``Now we have an improved political climate in Europe. To state
in this situation that we should have some kind of linkage, these
statements become less and less convincing,'' he said.
   Maj. Gen. Vladimir Kuklev said an official position had not been
formulated to Bush's proposal to cut conventional forces by about
10 percent, but that in his opinion, it was ``a major step
forward.''
   Gerasimov interrupted to say, ``official opinion coincides with
your opinion.''
   In a report from the NATO conference, Soviet TV commentator
Valetin Zorin said on the news program ``Vremya'' that ``Soviet
proposals at last made Washington move off dead center, where it
was for the past several months.''
   ``The deep contradictions between the NATO members are not
solved, but pressed deep inside,'' he said. ``Not by chance
President Bush in his speech yesterday avoided a sensitive question
that divided him from the majority of his European allies. The
issue is tactical nuclear weapons and the compromise decision on
this problem was made at the very last moment.''

   The U.S. government on Tuesday denounced
vigilante attacks by Jewish settlers in the Israel-occupied West
Bank.
   ``We urge all sides to refrain from actions that contribute to
raising the level of violence and hinder efforts to establish a
dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians,'' State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.
   Boucher didn't go into detail, but his comment came after what
the Israeli media called one of the worst vigilante attacks of the
nearly 18-month Palestinian uprising.
   ``We condemn the vigilante attacks,'' Boucher said. ``We note
the Israeli government's views that there could be `no
justification for people taking the law into their own hands.' We
certainly agree with that.''
   A 13-year-old girl became the 500th Palestinian killed in the
uprising in the incident Monday, when about two-dozen Jewish
settlers set a wheat field and part of a house ablaze in the
farming village of Kifil Harith.
   They also smashed windows in a car and a truck and shot up
several rooftop water tanks. The girl, Ibtisam Bozieh, was struck
in the chest by a bullet fired through a shutter, her family said.

   Brazilian soccer great Pele and a man who used to
pose for cigarette ads were honored Tuesday by the World Health
Organization, which wants the world to quit smoking for at least a
day.
   The U.N. health agency cited 40 individuals and organizations
for their anti-smoking efforts on the eve of its No-Tobacco Day, a
worldwide effort to urge people to quit smoking or chewing tobacco
for at least 24 hours.
   Pele was honored ``for taking the message to youth that smoking
and sports do not mix,'' WHO said in a statement.
   Actress Brooke Shields was cited for appearing on a public
service poster that said ``Smoking spoils your looks.''
   David Goerlitz, a former model for macho American cigarette
advertisements, was cited for ``recognizing his terrible mistake in
helping to promote a deadly product,'' the agency said.
   Goerlitz now works for private U.S. organizations that fight
smoking-related illnesses. He also testified before Congress in
support of laws to protect children against tobacco, WHO said.
   WHO also announced a posthumous medal to lung cancer victim Rose
Cipollone, who won a landmark U.S. lawsuit establishing liability
of cigarette manufacturers.
   Danish rock and movie star Michael Falk got a medal for
appearing in a video aimed at discouraging smoking by young people,
WHO said.
   The medals are to be presented at ceremonies throughout the
world Wednesday marking the second annual No-Tobacco Day, the theme
of which is the health risks of smoking for women and girls.
   Among the nations to most ardently embrace the day is Norway,
where the government has officially adopted a goal of eliminating
smoking by the end of the century.
   A message nationally distributed on posters and bumper stickers
said last year's No-Tobacco Day drew wide participation: ``Last
year it was estimated that 240,000 Norwegian smokers avoided
smoking. Two weeks later 40,000 of them had still not smoked and
150,000 said they were smoking less. Now you have another chance.
Good luck.''
   Norway introduced a law last summer to ban smoking in public
places. It required special smoking sections in public
transportation, theater lobbies, banks, post offices and at work
places occupied by more than one person.

<HEAD>Study Finds Race Irrelevant in Kidney Transplant Success ^Eds: Dawidson

<UNK>By MARCIA DUNN ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black kidney recipients fare as well as whites,
transplant doctors said Tuesday, contradicting other studies that
have found blacks tend to do much worse after such surgery.
   ``Even in our program, back in 1982, 1983, 1984, they (blacks)
did a little worse. Lately, they don't, and overall they do as well
as whites,'' said Dr. Ingemar Dawidson, associate professor of
surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at
Dallas.
   ``It's hard to tell (why). But I think the message is that we
can transplant blacks as well as whites,'' he said.
   Dr. Clive O. Callender, head of the Howard University Hospital
Transplant Center, said studies encompassing larger pools of
patients show kidney transplants are 10 percent to 20 percent less
successful in blacks than whites.
   ``I guess you believe what you want to,'' said Callender, one of
the nation's few black transplant surgeons.
   A 15 percent difference, for instance, was found in a study of
more than 2,000 patients who received kidneys from 1968 to 1988 at
the University of Alabama at Birmingham. That difference was noted
after the advent of the potent anti-rejection drug cyclosporine,
said Dr. Arnold Diethelm, chairman of surgery there.
   The drug, which suppresses the body's natural immune system, was
approved for general use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
in 1983.
   ``We haven't seen the advantages of cyclosporine in the black
race,'' Diethelm said. One explanation, he said, could be the high
incidence of high blood pressure among blacks and other genetic
factors.
   Dawidson, however, found blacks and whites did equally well with
cyclosporine. He said poorer success was noted among blacks when
earlier, less sophisticated anti-rejection medication was used.
   ``The biggest problem is we are ignorant of the immunogenic
system of black patients,'' Callender said. ``Until we know that,
we'll be stabbing in the dark.''
   Dawidson reported at the annual meeting of the American Society
of Transplant Physicians that 70 percent of the center's 130 black
patients since 1982 had functioning kidneys one year after
transplantation. That compared to a one-year success rate of 66
percent among 213 whites.
   The success rate two years after surgery was 68 percent for
blacks and 71 percent for whites, Dawidson said.
   During the past two years, the one-year success rate for both
groups has climbed to 85 percent to 90 percent, according to
Dawidson. Ninety-three percent of the black patients were alive a
year after surgery, compared to 90 percent of the whites, Dawidson
said. There also was no statistical difference five years later.
   About a fourth of both groups needed at least one dialysis
treatment following the transplant operation because of delayed
graft function, Dawidson said.
   Dr. Paul Peters, chairman of the University of Texas' urology
division, said careful matching of the tissue type between donor
and recipient likely contributed to the improved success rate among
blacks. He also cited the center's experience in dealing with black
patients.
   Blacks comprise nearly a third of all patients at Parkland
Memorial Hospital, where the kidney transplants were performed.
   ``I don't think we can take praise for better surgical
techniques because there are plenty of places that can do it just
as well,'' Peters said. ``But we are familiar with the problems of
black patients.''
   It's difficult to know if race plays a role in the outcome of
heart transplantation since the procedure is so rarely performed on
blacks, Callender said. But doctors at the University of Pittsburgh
are finding similar survival rates among whites, blacks and other
minorities.
   The Texas doctors have not yet studied the long-term results of
black kidney patients. The feeling elsewhere, however, is that
blacks lag far behind whites ``over the long haul,'' according to
Dr. Philip Held, program director of the renal research program at
The Urban Institute in Washington.
   ``But what does that mean? It doesn't mean transplantation is a
bad idea for blacks,'' Held said. ``For a black patient, the option
is not to become white. His option is transplantation or dialysis.''

<HEAD>Secret Police Chief Escapes Car Bomb that Kills Four</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb intended for the chief of the
secret police killed his bodyguard and three passersby Tuesday,
police said.
   The chief of police, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, escaped with only
bruises.
   At least 37 others were injured in the assassination attempt
that coincided with the start of a three-day international
conference on how to protect officials from terrorism. Police said
seven of those injured were bodyguards, and three of them were
seriously hurt.
   Maza Marquez, nicknamed ``Kojak'' because of his aggressive
investigations of drug trafficking, was being driven to his office
in a bullet-proof car when the bomb exploded in a parked car on a
main street.
   No one claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell on Colombia's
powerful and violent cocaine trafficking cartels. They detest Maza
Marquez, whose investigations have uncovered links between
narcotics traffickers and the military and have led to many arrests.
   Police said the blast killed one bodyguard traveling in another
car and three passersby, including a policeman.
   Also injured, mostly by flying glass, were about 30 passersby
including two children who were waiting for a school bus.
   Police said the bomb was planted in a stolen white Chevrolet
Monza and apparently was detonated by remote control.
   The blast reduced the car to twisted metal, damaged several
buildings and shattered windows as far as three blocks away. The
size or type of bomb were not known immediately.
   Traffickers recently have targeted high-ranking justice and
police officials.
   Security and legal experts from the United States, Northern
Ireland, Italy and France attended the conference, which was
proposed by an international group in Washington that advocates
more security and longer jail sentences for terrorists and drug
traffickers.
   It was the latest in a series of attacks in this nation plagued
by drug traffickers, leftist guerrilla organizations and right-wing
death squads.

   Despite weeks of political turmoil that has
gripped China, a band of Peace Corps volunteers plans to travel
there in mid-August to begin a two-year experiment as English
teachers.
   The two-dozen volunteers were hailed Tuesday as ``the hand
clasp'' between China and the United States as they embarked on a
training course for the Corps' first-ever project in a communist
country.
   At a ceremony marked by inspirational speeches, cups of tea and
good-will wishes, the group celebrated its historic venture with
Peace Corps officials and representatives from the Chinese Embassy.
   ``In a way, this is a symbolic gesture, part of China's opening
up and choosing closer relations to the United States,'' said Paul
Englesberg, the group's team leader.
   Peace Corps Director Paul Coverdell told the group they were
``embarking on a special mission and taking a special piece of our
country with you.''
   ``You are the hand clasp between us, you are the symbol of
relations between two nations and their commitment to peace,''
Coverdell said.
   Xiao Houde, the counsellor of the Chinese Embassy, told the
group the program ``is very important because it reflects the
friendship between our two peoples.
   ``You have a special responsibility. You will set an example for
your followers,'' Xiao said.
   Lisa Smoker, 24, of Lancaster, Pa., and Janelle Cavanagh, 22, of
San Francisco, Calif., said the political tumult doesn't bother
them.
   ``I'm not worried,'' Ms. Smoker said. ``The demonstrations don't
seem to be directed against Americans.''
   Ms. Cavanagh said her parents were excited for her, since they
both had expressed an interest in joining the Peace Corps when they
were young, but had not been able to fulfill their dreams.
   ``I guess I'm the one to get the chance,'' Ms. Cavanagh said.
   Peace Corps spokesman James C. Flanigan said that despite the
pro-democracy demonstrations and political uncertainty that have
gripped China, the trainees have several months to prepare, ``and
by then, things may shake down a little.''
   The Chinese are eager to have English teachers in order to help
push forward with Deng Xioping's modernization program, and
Flanigan said the Corps has received no indication from China that
the program will not move forward.
   The group will be the first in the Peace Corps' 28-year history
to serve in a communist nation. Currently, there are 6,000 American
volunteers and trainees working in 65 nations under the program,
established to help people in the developing world.
   After an intensive three-month course in Chinese language,
culture and technical arts, 20 of the volunteers will be chosen to
teach English in various locations in China's western province of
Sichuan.
   Tuesday's ceremony marked the end of a nearly five-year effort
to bring the U.S. program to China.
   ``Our presence is definitely a sign of transition in the
U.S.-China relationship,'' Flanigan said. ``In the 1970s, we were
reviled in China as an imperialistic agency.''
   As the Chinese aspired to impress lesser-developed nations
during those years, the American volunteer agency bore the brunt of
a Chinese propaganda attack. Radio China broadcast attacks against
the Peace Corps, condemning the workers as agents for the CIA.
   Relations improved after President Nixon's historic trip to
Beijing in 1972, but it wasn't until Election Night 1984 that the
subject of a trial run for the Corps was suggested by the Chinese.
   Chinese officials had been invited to watch a broadcast of the
U.S. election returns at the Great Wall Hotel in Beijing. A Chinese
official approached an American official, saying there was interest
in the program.
   Although the Chinese initially asked for some 800 volunteers, it
was decided that ``the emphasis should be on quality program, over
a large number of volunteers,'' Flanigan said.
   The Chinese have requested English teachers for the trial run,
and if both sides find the two-year program satisfactory, other
types of volunteers in health, agriculture or other technical
fields might be used.
   The volunteers have come from all around the country and only a
handful have any skills in the Chinese language, but they all have
a zest for adventure and interest in helping their fellow man.
   ``I didn't do any military service, but I felt compelled to do
something for my country,'' said David Moore, 29, of San Antonio,
Texas.
   Moore, who has a masters degree in teaching English as a second
language, said he has always been fascinated by Asia, and relishes
the chance to live among the Chinese.
   ``I'll be teaching English, but also about America. You can't
teach language without giving people insight into the culture,''
Moore said.

   The United Nations is seeking $50 million
more for an emergency operation to save 100,000 people from
starving in a war-induced famine in southern Sudan, an official
said Tuesday.
   James Grant, head of the U.N. Operation Lifeline Sudan, said
$130 million that already has been donated by governments and
private organizations is not enough.
   The operation, plagued by political conflicts, logistical
problems and armed attacks, must start dropping food from planes,
Grant said.
   At a news conference in Nairobi, he said he will appeal for
money to carry the operation to the end of the year at a June 13
donors' conference in New York.
   The United Nations had hoped to stockpile 100,000 tons of food
in southern Sudan before the end of May, but only has delivered
about half that amount.
   Its operation has been plagued by political conflicts,
logistical problems and armed attacks by bandits and paramilitary
groups.
   Th most recent attack was Sunday, when bandits struck a truck
convoy and killed three people.
   With the start of a five-month rainy season already under way,
delivery of food by trucks, trains and airplanes is becoming more
difficult each day. Havey rains usually make roads, rail lines and
runways unusable, when Grant plans to start air drops.
   Rebels have been fighting six years for autonomy for the
minority Christians and animists of southern Sudan. They are
observing a unilateral cease-fire this month to permit in emergency
supplies and allow the Moslem-dominated government in the north
time to organize a peace conference.

   The National Abortion Rights Action League
launched a newspaper ad campaign Tuesday designed to let voters
back home read the ``outrageous'' comments their elected officials
are making about women and abortion.
   ``Many of the constituents in districts around the country do
not know what their congresspeople say and do regarding a woman's
right to choose,'' said NARAL executive director Kate Michelman.
``We believe that it will make a difference when they do know.''
   The league's first target was freshman Rep. Craig James, a
Florida Republican whose district covers an area from Jacksonville
south to Cape Canaveral. James last year narrowly wrested the seat
from veteran Rep. Bill Chappell, a Democrat whose name had come up
in connection with the Pentagon procurement scandal.
   The ad in the Daytona Beach News-Journal paraphrased comments
that James made during a May 10 hearing of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, according to the
abortion rights league.
   Among the statements the group attributed to James were that
pregnant women are too confused to make a rational decision about
whether or not to have an abortion; safe and legal abortions
promote promiscuity and increase the spread of AIDS; and if
abortion becomes illegal, women who seek abortions and all those
who help them would be criminals and should be punished.
   ``The Supreme Court is now reconsidering who will have the right
to decide if a woman can have an abortion. Politicians like Craig
James? Or you?'' the ad says. ``Ultimately you will. With your
vote.''
   Michelman said the ad is the first of its kind for the league
but ``we will see more of this.'' She said her group has gathered a
store of ``tremendously outrageous statements about reproductive
rights and women in general'' from other legislators and is
developing a list of targets, of which James is the first.
   ``We're going to educate the public and organize them into a
voting block,'' Michelman said. ``We intend to make this a decisive
issue for the public's voting decisions in 1989 and 1990. This is
not just about congressmen and senators. It's governors and state
legislators and county commissioners and the whole range of
political public office.''
   James' press secretary, Brian Flood, called the ad a
fund-raising ploy and said the congressman's position on abortion
has always been clear _ he is opposed to it except where a woman's
life is endangered or in cases of rape or incest.
   ``It is extremely improper and way out of line to interpret
anything said at this hearing as anti-woman,'' Flood said. ``This
is a despicable political effort to undermine his continued service
in Congress.''
   Flood called the NARAL ad ``the beginning of what will be a
nasty effort'' to unseat James by trying to find ``little bits of
information and take them out of context and present them in a very
radical way like this in an attempt to damage his credibility and
reputation. I don't think it's going to work.''
   Michelman said the timing of the ad so far in advance of the
1990 election is meant to coincide with increased public interest
in the abortion rights issue while the Supreme Court weighs a
Missouri case that could have profound consequences for women's
access to abortion.
   As for whether James' constituents will remember the ad come
November 1990, she said, ``They won't forget because we won't let
them forget.''

<HEAD>West Berlin Mayor Snubbed at Dinner for Bush</HEAD>

   The leftist West Berlin mayor who
governs with the help of an anti-NATO party was noticeably absent
from the guest list at Tuesday's state dinner for President Bush.
   While Mayor Walter Momper has said Bush would be welcome to
visit his city, some of Momper's partners in his coalition
government don't feel the same _ and they said so in a statement
less than two months ago.
   While Momper was being snubbed at Tuesday night's feast, the
city's former conservative mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, was prominent
on the guest list. He joined 150 business, political and cultural
leaders for a gourmet meal of turbot and creamed asparagus at an
elegant 18th-century villa in Bonn.
   Momper spent the night in communist East Berlin attending a
concert by the famed Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of
Metropolitan Opera conductor James Levine.
   West Berlin legally remains under the control of World War II
Allies France, Britain and the United States, although day-to-day
administration is left to the Germans.
   The three Allies maintain military forces in the city, located
deep inside communist East German territory. U.S. officials
routinely stress their commitment to guaranteeing West Berlin's
security and its links to the West.
   West Berlin officials said they were stunned that Momper was not
invited and charged that the government had snubbed the entire city
by inviting Diepgen instead.
   Diepgen is a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic party, but he lost power after the Berlin elections in
January.
   Momper, a Social Democrat, heads a coalition government that
includes the far-left environmentalist Alternative List party. The
Alternative List in April said it would oppose a Bush visit to West
Berlin during his current European swing, although Momper asserted
the president would be welcome.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, who heads the leftist Social Democratic
Party, said he was ``amazed'' that Diepgen was invited and not
Momper.
   Momper told reporters in West Berlin that the decision was
``alienating and incredibly impolite.''
   Vogel, who was invited to the dinner, said he planned to deliver
``heartfelt greetings'' from Momper to Bush and suggest to the
president that he meet another time with Momper.
   West German television showed Bush greeting Diepgen with a broad
smile and a handshake at a reception before the dinner.
   Bush told reporters after arriving in Bonn that he would address
the status of Berlin during a speech in the city of Mainz on
Wednesday.
   Then-President Ronald Reagan, during a visit to Berlin in 1987,
proposed a wide-ranging plan to ease tensions in the divided city
and revitalize it into an international magnet for trade and
sporting events.
   Government spokesman Ulrich Strempel said Momper was not invited
to the banquet because of limited seating arrangements at the
banquet hall.
   Strempel said many politicians were not invited to make room for
representatives from politics, industry and the arts.

   President Bush exulted Tuesday in the
success of a NATO summit that produced a united Western front on
both conventional and nuclear weapons and smoothed over a dispute
with West Germany in the process.
   Bush flew to Bonn from Brussels where the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization had just forged a compromise on
short-range nuclear missiles. The deal will keep some of the NATO
weapons deployed indefinitely while providing a framework for
eventual negotiations with the Soviets to reduce the stockpiles
once conventional weapons in Europe are cut.
   Bush met one-on-one in Bonn with West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, who called the president ``a friend among friends.'' Bush
said he was ``very pleased with the reaction to the NATO decision.''
   In a triumphant mood, Bush said the alliance had scored a
``double hit'' with its decision on the nuclear issue and its
endorsement of his proposal for widespread reductions in troops and
conventional weapons based in Europe.
   The communique winding up the 40th anniversary summit meeting
specified that only a ``partial reduction'' in battlefield nuclear
weapons would be pursued.
   Bush said most people do not realize the Soviets have a
numerical advantage in such weapons, and he challenged Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to order a unilateral cutback.
   The call for only a ``partial reduction'' was a setback for
Kohl, who had sought swift U.S.-Soviet negotiations with the
possible aim of eliminating the missiles both in NATO and the
Warsaw Pact.
   ``There will be no third zero,'' Bush said. ``Partial means
partial.''
   The two other ``zeroes'' were in the 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty
banning two categories of intermediate-range missiles.
   Despite the tilt toward the U.S. position, Kohl did not leave
the summit empty-handed. On a related issue, Bush and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher agreed to postpone modernization of the
U.S.-built Lance launchers that are deployed mostly in West Germany.
   Bush, discussing the compromise at a news conference, said: ``I
don't view it as a victory for the United States. I view it as a
victory for the alliance.''
   Bush and Thatcher had wanted to more than triple the range of
the Lances, but at West Germany's urging the allies decided to
postpone any modernization until 1992. At that point, the
communique said, ``the introduction and deployment of a follow-on
system for the Lance will be dealt with in 1992 in the light of
overall security developments.''
   The timetable postpones superpower negotiations on short-range
nuclear weapons until the two alliances conclude an accord in
Vienna to reduce their conventional forces.
   The NATO leaders also gave a green light to Congress to finance
the development of a more powerful short-range missile in the
meantime.
   At a news conference later Tuesday, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III cautioned the Soviet Union that the NATO proposals are a
``package deal.''
   ``This is not something we have put on the table, the idea that
the East can come in and pick what they like and leave what they
don't like,'' he said.
   Kohl, under intense disarmament pressure at home, praised the
United States for breaking the impasse over when and whether to
negotiate cuts in the short-range nuclear weapons.
   But in the city of Mainz, where Bush is scheduled to speak on
Wednesday, about 1,000 protesters marched through the street
distributing leaflets saying, ``Bush is not welcome here.''
   Police have announced measures to virtually seal off the city
from any possible influx of violence-prone demonstrators during
Bush's appearance.
   Kohl used remarks at a state dinner Tuesday evening to reassure
the West that his country is not ``romantically and dreamily
looking toward the East.'' Affirming West Germany's solid support
for NATO, Kohl said: ``We are not wanderers between two worlds.''
   Bush, in turn, said that ``in 1989, we are nearer our goals of
peace and European reconciliation than at any time since the
founding of NATO'' in 1949.
   Bush also announced that West Germans no longer will be required
to have visas to visit the United States, under a pilot program
offering easier access to residents of selected countries. The
announcement duplicated a gesture Bush made earlier this week to
the Italians.
   Bush reported a cautious but positive Soviet response to the
proposal he outlined Monday for reducing U.S. and Soviet troops in
Europe to 275,000 each and limiting tanks, artillery and combat
aircraft, as well.
   ``They really didn't slam the door and come on a negative
view,'' Bush said.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, in Paris for a
human rights conference, said the Bush proposals were ``a step in
the right direction.'' But he said ``it will take time to examine
the American proposals in detail and determine the position of the
U.S.S.R.''
   In Moscow, Lt. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, a member of the Soviet
general staff, said: ``We have all long been waiting for the United
States to answer arms proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and
other socialist countries. Certainly, the United States could not
keep silent indefinitely.''
   But Bush said he had not felt under siege because ``I've known
exactly what I want to do.''
   His performance at the summit was hailed by NATO General
Secretary Manfred Woerner, who said Bush's ``leadership set the
tone for the whole meeting.''

   Rep. Claude Pepper, who crusaded for Franklin
Roosevelt's New Deal in the 1930s and was still championing the
rights of the elderly a half-century later, died Tuesday at 88.
   He was the oldest member of Congress.
   Pepper had been hospitalized since April 6, suffering from an
undisclosed stomach ailment. He died at Walter Reed Army Hospital,
where he returned a month ago after an interim stay at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
   Rochelle Jones, Pepper's press secretary, said the congressman
died at mid-afternoon.
   The Florida Democrat was elected to the Senate in 1936 and
promptly made his mark as an architect of some of the nation's most
enduring ``safety net'' programs, including Social Security, the
minimum wage, and medical assistance to the elderly and handicapped
children.
   He remained in the Senate for 14 years, and after an interlude
practicing law and teaching, began a House career that would
include 14 terms.
   He was still barnstorming last year in an effort to fend off
Reagan budget cuts and to promote fellow liberal Michael Dukakis in
the presidential race.
   Pepper was born on Sept. 8, 1900, on a farm near Dudleyville,
Ala., and grew up poor. He put himself through the University of
Alabama and Harvard Law School toting cafeteria trays and emptying
coal ashes in a power plant.
   Elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1929, Pepper
moved onto the U.S. Senate seven years later. Though he had been in
the House for nearly four decades, he was still called ``senator''
by colleagues in Congress.
   A bitter Democratic primary in 1950 ended his Senate career _
including the label of ``Red Pepper,'' playing on claims during the
communist scare of the era that he was soft on the Soviet Union. A
fellow Democrat, George Smathers, took his place.
   Pepper returned to his law practice, but then was elected to the
U.S. House from the Miami district in 1962. He was never defeated
again, largely because of his dogged attention to retirees in a
city heavily populated by them.
   Although he was a millionaire from investments and property
holdings, Pepper always scoffed at the thought of fading away to
retirement and a rocking chair.
   His florid, finger-wagging lectures at committee hearings
reflected the politics of the old rural South where he had his
roots. Often he faced news cameras like a TV star as he raked a
recalcitrant witness over the coals.

   Syrian army gunners shelled Lebanon's
Christian enclave with howitzers, mortars and tank cannons Tuesday
despite renewed calls to honor a cease-fire declared by Arab
leaders.
   Police said one civilian was killed in the barrage by Syrians
deployed in Moslem west Beirut and the capital's southern slums.
   That raised the overall toll to 360 killed and 1,396 wounded
since the latest round of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war broke out
March 8.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with
standing rules, said army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000
mostly Christian troops did not fire back.
   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy said the Bush administration was
``discouraged'' by Syria's failure to enter into a dialogue with
Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's dual government.
   ``We've been urging Syria privately ... and publicly ... that
given its description of its own role here as a peacekeeper that
its action should be more in line with those of a peacekeeper,'' he
said, ``that what is necessary in Lebanon is a political dialogue
to get under way, not have a lot of shelling.
   ``The Syrians and certainly the Lebanese Moslems should be
dialoguing with ... (Aoun) rather than criticizing him. I find the
Syrian position to date on that specific point has been unwise.''
   It was the strongest public criticism of Syria by a U.S.
official during the present confrontation between Aoun and an
alliance of the Syrian army and Druse leader Walid Jumblatt's
Progressive Socialist Party.
   McCarthy spoke after meeting with Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Farouk Abillama in Christian east Beirut as Syrians
sporadically shelled the sector.
   Dozens of howitzer shells crashed onto the Christian coastline
north of Beirut, hitting the ports of Jounieh and Byblos, the
police spokesman said.
   Shelling of the coast is intended to prevent the Christians from
receiving war material and other supplies.
   Syrian gunners also opened up at the Christian suburbs of
Hadath, Kfarsheema and Baabda, southeast of Beirut, he added.
   Baabda houses the presidential palace. Aoun has been staying in
its bunker throughout the 11 weeks of shelling duels.
   The spokesman said the palace, ravaged by previous shelling, was
not targeted Tuesday.
   Shelling has increased despite a call by Arab heads of state for
a complete cease-fire as they ended a summit on Friday in
Casablanca, Morocco. The Arab League declared a cease-fire on May
11.
   The leaders formed a committee made up of the heads of state of
Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Algeria to try to resolve the Lebanon
crisis within six months.
   The committee was given a mandate to arrange for the Lebanese
Parliament to convene to draw up political reforms and elect a new
president who would form a government of national reconciliation.
   The summit pledged to support the new government in
re-establishing state authority with its own forces on Lebanon's
entire territory _ an indirect assertion that the Syrians should
withdraw.
   McCarthy called the Arab moves were ``encouraging developments.''
   Syria maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League. Aoun says the Syrians
lost their credibility as peacekeepers when they sided with the
Moslems in the civil war.
   Aoun, 54, a Maronite, complained in a weekend memorandum to the
Arab League that Syrian gunners were not respecting the truce
called by Arab leaders, his command said.
   King Hassan II of Morocco, who heads the committee on Lebanon,
told a news conference in Rabat the Arabs would make every effort
to solve the problem, but that the solution would have to come from
the Lebanese themselves.

<HEAD>Dozen Foreign Investments of More Than $1 Billion in U.S. Last Year</HEAD>

   A dozen investments of more than $1 billion
apiece helped increase foreign direct investments in the United
States to $65 billion last year, a 61.3 percent rise over 1987's
$40.3 billion, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.
   Britain and Japan led the world in buying or establishing
business enterprises in the United States and each had four of the
dozen $1 billion-plus investors, the department said. Two Canadian
investments also also topped the $1 billion mark.
   The department said the 12 investments represented 80 percent of
the 1988 increase. There were only six investments totaling more
than $1 billion in 1987.
   The report covered only foreign direct investment in the United
States, such as buying control of a company. It did not include
passive investment by foreigners, such as purchasing stocks or
bonds which they are not in a position to manage.
   Analyst James Annable of First National Bank of Chicago said the
sharp increase in foreign direct investment ``was almost as much of
a given as death and taxes'' given the nation's high budget and
trade deficits.
   ``We're going to see this number grow like clockwork every
year,'' Annable said.
   The department said factors encouraging foreign investment
include the profitability of U.S. companies, a large consumer
market, an advanced technological base and a cheaper dollar
compared with foreign currency.
   Because of growing foreign investment, legislation has been
introduced in Congress to require greater disclosure about foreign
investors and their purchases.
   Last year's foreign investments were widespread, the department
said in its report.
   ``Substantial increases occurred in all major industry groups
except services, real estate and financing (except banking),'' the
report said.
   The total British direct investment was $21.5 billion, followed
by Japan's $14.2 billion. Canada was third with $10.4 billion.
   Investments in the manufacturing sector totaled $31.6 billion;
retail trade, $8 billion, and insurance, $5.8 billion.

   The head of a hotel workers union said no new
talks are planned before a five-year contract covering 30,000
employees expires Thursday, but said there would be no strike as
long as owners keep talking in good faith.
   ``June 1 is not some magic date,'' Jim Arnold, head of Culinary
Union Local 226, said Tuesday. ``I'm not ruling out any
possibility. But as long as we haven't reached an impasse, we'll
continue to negotiate.''
   Leaders on both sides hope to avoid a repeat of the bitter 1984
hotel strike that left workers off the job for 75 days and affected
the city's lifeblood tourism industry.
   Negotiating teams made a breakthrough Friday night when the
union reached an agreement with six major hotels. The six signed an
agreement similar to a pact signed earlier this month with the
Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino.
   Officials at the six hotels say the new contract will cost them
$250 million over five years.
   Twenty-four other hotels still must continue negotiating. The
main issue is wages.
   The new contract with the six resorts covers 10,000 workers,
about one-third of the union's membership. Union members will vote
on the contract Wednesday.
   The six hotels signing Friday were Caesars Palace, Bally's, the
Flamingo Hilton, the Las Vegas Hilton, the Tropicana and Circus
Circus.
   The contract calls for a $1.25 hourly increase spread over the
five years of the agreement, along with a 95-cent-an-hour increase
in contributions to the health and welfare fund.

<HEAD>Inspectors Trying To Determine How Close Plane Came to Ditching</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators and airline mechanics
inspected a TWA jumbo jet on Tuesday to determine how close the
plane came to ditching after it started leaking fuel over the
Pacific Ocean.
   Investigators suspect a break in the fuel line feeding the
Lockheed L-1011's left wing engine caused the leak, said George W.
Harvey, a Federal Aviation Administration administrator.
   TWA Flight 235, bound from Los Angeles with 205 people aboard,
made an emergency landing early Monday at Hilo International
Airport on the island of Hawaii, about 200 miles southeast of its
destination of Honolulu.
   TWA spokesman Don Morrison in St. Louis said it was not known
how much fuel was left when the plane landed, but a televised news
report said the plane had enough for just four minutes of flight.
   Investigators had a general idea of how much fuel was left,
Harvey said, ``but we won't have anything ready to release on that
until tomorrow.''
   The plane was instructed to divert to Hilo when its pilot
reported the jet was running low on fuel when it was 450 miles from
Honolulu, according to FAA reports.
   The plane's left engine was shut down after the crew realized
fuel was leaking from the wing, but was unable to stop the leak,
Morrison said. The plane has two main fuel tanks.

<TEXT>
   The government intensified its charges
Tuesday that the United States is improperly helping Solidarity's
election campaign _ a claim Solidarity and U.S. diplomats denied.
   A State Department spokesman said Congress has authorized $1
million annually for Solidarity trade union for at least two years.
But U.S. spokesman Richard Boucher added: ``We're not interfering
with the election campaign.''
   Zbyslaw Rykowski, the deputy government spokesman in Warsaw,
said an official statement Monday accusing Western diplomats of
helping the opposition before Sunday's elections referred to
``representatives of the embassy of the United States.''
   But he added he hoped the matter ``would have no influence'' on
President Bush's planned mid-July visit to Poland.
   ``The way of behaving of those diplomats unambiguously showed
that they were taking part in the electoral campaign in favor of
the opposition,'' Rykowski said.
   He told a news conference he had a dossier on alleged incidents,
but ``it's in no one's interest to say anything more.''
   In Warsaw, a U.S. Embassy spokesman read a response saying:
``Embassy personnel in keeping with standard diplomatic practice
are responsible for keeping abreast of important developments in
Poland, including the elections.
   ``However, the embassy emphatically denies that any of its
personnel have engaged in improper activities or that they have
actively supported one group or one candidate over any others.''
   The accusation came in the final days of the campaign for
Poland's first democratic elections since World War II.
   Poles vote Sunday for 100 members of a new senate that will be
the East bloc's first fully democratically elected legislative body.
   They also choose 460 members for the existing parliament, where
the opposition may compete for 161 seats. The rest are reserved for
the Communist Party and its allies.
   Solidarity has endorsed candidates for all contestable seats.
   Answering statements about Solidarity claims the opposition is
ahead in the campaign, Rykowski predicted the Communist Party
coalition would do well.
   He said the party's campaign has not had to be as visible as
Solidarity's because, ``One knows what one can expect from us.''
   ``The prognoses for our side are good,'' he said. ``All the data
presented by our opponents are only the result of their wishful
thinking.''
   He said the party and its allies were ``the guarantors of
certainty and stability of this country. We don't have to use
election techniques taken from an American movie.''
   Government polls show about 85 percent of the country's
approximately 26 million voters will participate, he said. In
Poland's last elections, for local offices in June 1988, the
official turnout was put at 56 percent but the opposition said it
was much lower.
   Monday's government statement alleged ``an unprecedented
violation of Poland's sovereignty.''
   It mentioned diplomats appearing at opposition election rallies,
financial donations flowing to Solidarity's campaign from the West
and U.S.-financed Radio Free Europe, which broadcasts without
interference to Poland in Polish.
   Solidarity said help received from abroad was consistent with
Polish law and accused the government of trying to frighten voters.
   ``They want to scare those who are undecided,'' the statement
said ``Scaring citizens does not serve it well, nor does abuse of
patriotic feelings or manipulation of facts.''
   Solidarity has not given details of money it has received, but
says most contributions are from Poles abroad who are entitled to
vote.
   City officials, meanwhile, announced the creation of a
free-speech corner from Thursday in the city's Agrykola park.
   Similar to London's Speaker's Corner, it will be open to orators
on any theme so long as they ``abide by the generally adopted moral
norms and good manners and international conventions signed by
Poland,'' the Warsaw daily Zycie Warszawy reported.
   Pro-Solidarity university students announced they would suspend
strikes they have staged for the past week because of ``the
approaching elections and the possibility of using the wave of
student strikes as propaganda against opposition candidates.''
   The strikes began May 23 after a Warsaw court denied an
application to charter the Independent Students Association,
closely linked to the Solidarity union movement.
   In denying the application the court said the association
illegally claimed it has the right to organize strikes.
   Association leaders said Tuesday they would appeal the court
decision and resume strikes in the autumn if authorities still
refuse to register the organization. They said students at 43
institutions of higher learning had participated in the strikes but
gave no further details.

<HEAD>Friedheim Dead at 89; Remedies Saved Millions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Ernst A. H. Friedheim, who developed a drug
to treat African sleeping sickness that probably has saved 2
million lives, has died of kidney cancer at the age of 89.
   Friedheim, who died at home Saturday, devised melarsoprol in the
1930s and '40s to treat trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness. The
disease, spread by the tsetse fly, remains a serious problem in
Africa and Friedheim's drug is still used to treat some more
advanced cases.
   He also developed drugs to treat many other parasitic tropical
diseases, and later in his career devised remedies for lead and
mercury poisoning. When he died he also was working on drugs to
treat cancer.
   ``He continued to work virtually until his death,'' said Thomas
Donnelly, a veterinarian who worked with Friedheim. ``When he was
in the hospital he kept asking me about the results of our
experiments. He said, `I have to know.' He knew he was running out
of time.''
   Born in Switzerland, Friedheim earned a medical degree as well
as a doctorate in chemistry. This training allowed him relative
independence in a field dominated by research teams.
   Rockefeller University, where Friedheim had been a professor
since 1978, issued a statement saying he ``single-handedly
performed chemical synthesis, laboratory evaluation, and clinical
testing in the field.'' The latter took him to Africa, Asia, South
America and Pacific islands.
   ``It was unusual the way he was able to take the (development
of) a drug from the laboratory to its application in the field,''
said Dr. William Trager, a leading malaria researcher. ``He had a
lot of drive. He went out to Africa in the old days, when it was
really Africa.''
   A month ago Friedheim was honored at the 26th meeting of the
International Council for Trypanosomiasis Research in Kenya. Peter
deRaadt of the World Health Organization's parasitic diseases unit
credited Friedheim's development of melarsoprol with saving the
lives of 2 million Africans.
   Donnelly said that, judging from estimates in various medical
texts, Friedheim's other drugs probably have saved an additional 1
million lives around the world.
   He is survived by his wife, Suzanne Hagerstrom-Friedheim.
Funeral arrangements are private.

   Bulgaria took the offensive Tuesday at the opening
session of an international human rights conference by blaming
Turkey for recent violence involving Bulgaria's ethnic Turks.
   The monthlong conference is to review human rights progress
among the 35 nations that are signatories of the 1975 Helsinki
Final Act.
   It also is expected to single out nations accused of specific
abuses, and Romania and Bulgaria are expected to take the brunt of
criticism.
   About 20 foreign ministers attended the opening of the monthlong
conference, the first of three mandated by the Vienna review
committee of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,
which ended in January.
   In one of the first speeches, Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov of
Bulgaria accused ``foreign circles'' of being behind recent
disturbances in his country in which ethnic Turks reportedly have
been killed.
   The Bulgarian delegation made available the text of a speech by
President Todor Zhivkov that said ``certain circles in the Republic
of Turkey'' have launched a ``continuously escalating
anti-Bulgarian campaign.''
   ``This policy represents a gross interference in the internal
affairs of a sovereign state,'' the statement said.
   The Bulgarian president, whose speech was broadcast on Monday,
urged Turkey to open its border to all ``Bulgarian Moslems'' who
want to go there.
   Bulgaria has been deporting ethnic Turks it considers
undesirable. An estimated 300 have been forced to leave, most to
Austria and Yugoslavia. Many also have been picked up by Turkish
airliners for resettlement in Turkey.
   According to an official report, three people died in recent
ethnic unrest. Deportees have put the figure at up to 30. The
reports could not be confirmed independently.
   Mladenov said Bulgaria wanted to discuss the problems with
``realism and good will.''
   The second human rights conference is to be held in Copenhagen
in 1990 and a third in Moscow in 1991.

   With his arms control challenge to
Moscow, President Bush also sent a message home _ an almost
taunting told-you-so to the political critics who said he was
lagging instead of leading.
   It is, of course, in loftier, more diplomatic language. And when
he was asked whether he'd intended that message, he said not. And
laughed.
   ``I'm not going to get into that game with the Congress,'' he
said during a news conference at NATO on Tuesday. ``Or anyone
else.''
   But there was no masking the president's satisfaction in telling
detractors and everyone else that he'd known what he was doing
during the long diplomatic dry spell.
   He said he'd been studying, planning and preparing what the
White House called the most far-reaching Western proposal for
conventional arms control since World War II.
   Bush noted that his administration took a bit of a hammering in
Congress and elsewhere for its go-slow, silent treatment of Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's Soviet peace offensive.
   But he said it hadn't bothered him. ``I haven't felt under seige
in the United States because I knew exactly what we wanted to do,''
the president said.
   After presenting his arms control proposal to the Atlantic
allies on Monday, Bush said ``this is the way we plan to lead _
lead the alliance and lead the Free World.''
   It was a measure of his mood. He'd been accused of a failure to
lead.
   Bush said at a news conference the criticism hadn't bothered
him, that he's weathered enough political criticism to become
immune. ``I just kind of write it off _ I was elected to do what I
think is right.''
   Bush emerged from the 40th anniversary NATO summit in Brussels
with a strengthened hand both internationally and domestically. His
call for swift East-West troop, tank and aircraft cuts was a
dramatic summit debut for the new leader at the NATO table. Bush
said he meant to ``transform the military map of Europe,'' and
whether or not his proposal achieves that aim, he is on the
initiative now. He relished the role.
   ``Here we go now, on the offense, with a proposal that is bold
and tests whether the Soviet Union will move,'' he said Monday.
   That was parlayed with a deal fashioned by NATO foreign
ministers early Tuesday, after a long night of negotiations, to
settle an intramural dispute about negotiations on short-range
nuclear missiles.
   It was a compromise on Bush terms, overriding earlier West
German demands for immediate talks with the Soviet Union on
short-range missile reductions. The NATO settlement calls for those
talks to await an East-West agreement to reduce troops and
conventional weapons. And the short-range missiles will stay put
until there have been actual cuts in conventional forces.
   ``The successful results of this summit have given us a double
hit,'' Bush rejoiced.
   But he crowed with care, so as not to rub it in for the West
Germans, his next hosts. His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, had
called the missile deal a victory for the United States and for
NATO. Bush amended that. ``I don't view it as a victory for the
United States _ I view it as a victory for the alliance,'' he said.
   The president also said the West Germans had strongly supported
the missile settlement.
   The NATO deal, said to have been designed largely by Secretary
of State James A. Baker III, cleared the table of an issue that had
threatened to sow discord at the summit.
   With that deal in hand, Bush and West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl took separate commuter-length flights to Bonn for their
one-on-one meetings. After the first one, they joined in praise of
the NATO agreements.
   Kohl has been under political pressure to get negotiations going
immediately on the short-range missiles, almost all of them based
in West Germany, but he told Bush: ``You are a friend among
friends.''
   Neither admitted to any German misgivings about the short-range
missile compromise. ``I think we were all just winners in
Brussels,'' said Kohl.
   He also said Bush's visit would be helpful politically to him in
the West German elections that are due next year.
   Bush goes from West Germany to London, and returns to the United
States on Friday, strengthened politically as he confronts the
domestic agenda. He is likely to challenge the Democratic Congress
with his first veto even before he gets back to Washington, to
block a minimum wage increase he says is excessive and therefore
likely to cost jobs.
   He'll head home satisfied and, perhaps, a bit feisty. ``Whatever
political arrows might have been fired my way, it's all been worth
it,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
   The looting and fighting in the
streets that have shaken more than a dozen Argentine cities and
towns stem from an economic crisis of the first magnitude _ one
that has been simmering for months.
   The Central Bank, which had been selling U.S. dollars to prop up
the austral and fend off inflation, stopped the practice in
February. Argentina's national currency has plunged in value by
more than 90 percent since then.
   Inflation rocketed from 9.6 percent in February to 17 percent in
March, 33.4 percent in April and possibly 70 percent this month.
Private economists say it may top 100 percent in June.
   Wages failed to keep pace. Suddenly, food, medicine and other
basics were beyond the reach of hundreds of thousands of Argentines.
   Doubling the national minimum wage on Tuesday to 8,700 australs
a month, about $50, is not likely to help much.
   ``What people are earning doesn't enable them to put even one
meal a day on the table. That's a basic fact that society has to
deal with,'' said Beverly Keene of the human rights group Peace and
Justice Service.
   Inflation is but one facet of the crisis.
   The national budget is in deficit. The government of President
Raul Alfonsin is hard-pressed either to lay off employees or
further increase charges for telephones, electricity and other
public services, which were raised 40 percent only two weeks ago.
   The foreign debt has climbed to $59 billion. Annual interest
payments of $6 billion amount to about twice the annual trade
surplus, removing that as a source of investment. Interest has not
been paid since last year.
   Economic deterioration is compounded by political paralysis. The
governing Radical Civic Union lost national elections on May 14,
but President-elect Carlos Menem of the Peronist Party is not due
to take office until Dec. 10.
   Alfonsin has the authority to rule, but Menem has the crucial
public support.
   Origins of the economic crisis date to the 1950s. Argentines
since that decade have lived with a state-managed economy, powerful
labor unions and political polarization between the two main
parties and the military. Inflation has been triple-digit since the
1970s.
   Alfonsin, 62, has tried since his inauguration 5{ years ago to
reduce the role of the state, diminish the power of organized
labor, curtail the military's political ambitions and spark an
economy that has stagnated for a decade.
   In almost every area, he failed.

   The government controlled by Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega is holding at least 89 political prisoners
including opposition party officials, two opposition leaders said
Tuesday.
   ``The prisoners are nothing more than hostages,'' opposition
presidential candidate Guillermo Endara said in an interview with
The Associated Press.
   ``They (the Panamanian Defense Forces commanded by Noriega) take
people prisoner for a while and then if things are quiet they just
let them go,'' he said. ``They take people off the street, people
who were just watching a parade.''
   First vice presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon said
six people arrested May 24 while marching with the opposition
candidates to a meeting with a delegation from the Organization of
American States ``have not even been allowed to see their
families.''
   ``For most (of the 89) there has been no reply to habeas corpus
or other judicial petitions, showing how deeply the judiciary is
subordinated to the interests of the military dictatorship,'' Arias
Calderon told a news conference.
   International observers at the May 7 election said the
opposition, led by Endara, won the elections by about a 3-1 margin.
But the official returns were seized by troops and on May 10 the
vote was nullified by the government's Electoral Tribunal.
   The OAS, at a meeting in Washington, crticitized Noriega, the
nullification and the beating of opposition candidates. It urged a
quick transfer of power and sent a delegation to Panama.
   Arias Calderon distributed a list of 89 people he said were
political prisoners and it included opposition spokesman Luis
Martins; legislative candidate Felipe Escobar; Antonio Galvez, one
of Arias Calderon's bodyguards, and Jose Guillermo Lutrel, a
Panamanian Human Rights Committee election observer.
   He said the total held was more than 100 but some had not been
identified.
   Many of the prisoners were accused of threatening the security
of the state and were summarily sentenced to a year in jail by a
judge on the night of their arrest, according to Arias Calderon.
   He said such sentences often can be converted into fines payable
at the rate of a dollar a day but relatives of the prisoners had
been told nobody is available to collect the fines.
   Messages left for a Defense Forces spokesman for comment on
Arias Calderon's charges were not returned. The Defense Forces have
not commented on the issue despite previous requests.
   Endara said about half of the 170 to 200 people arrested during
and after the election have been released and it appears others are
being freed one-by-one and often without paying a fine.
   ``They haven't released anybody who is well-known, however,''
said Endara.
   Arias Calderon noted the OAS delegation is to file a report on
June 5 and the OAS council of ministers will meet the following day.
   He said again the opposition wants the OAS to recognize its
victory and impose a diplomatic and political quarantine on Panama
if Noriega and his hand-picked government refuse to surrender power.
   Arias Calderon said the opposition would continue to insist that
Noriega and the Panamanian Defense Forces be included in political
negotiations, saying they hold the real power.
   Noriega has said the political parties should settle the
dispute, and Arias Calderon said Noriega is ``trying to hide behind
a smokescreen.''

<HEAD>Banks Look to Official Aid on Debt Forgiveness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Commercial banks expect to hear at a meeting
in Madrid, Spain, on June 7 what help they can expect from
governments in reducing Third World debt, an international banking
official told Congress Tuesday.
   Horst Schulmann, a West German, heads the Institute of
International Finance, a Washington-based organization that
represents 182 big banks in the United States and 38 other
countries.
   He was testifying at a hearing on progress under Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's March proposal for debt reduction.
   ``Debt forgiveness is equivalent to foreign aid, but banks are
not in the foreign aid business,'' Schulmann said.
   ``If banks are coerced into taking large losses under the Brady
initiative, they will be unwilling to provide addditional ...
financing.''
   Third World countries owe about half their $1.2 trillion debt to
commercial banks, according to Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Comn. He
chaired the hearing as head of the subcommittee on international
economic policy of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Members of Congress and Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford
have warned banks that unless they cooperate with Brady, there
could be action against them from the U.S. government.
   Schulmann said the Madrid meeting will include Michel Camdessus
of France, who heads the International Monetary Fund. The fund,
owned by 151 govwernments, has promised to aside a part of its
future loans for debt reduction. Directors of its sister
organization, the World Bank, met on Tuesday to decide what role it
will take. Barber Conable, the bank's U.S. president, will also go
to Madrid.
   ``We are not planning to do anything for the commercial banks,''
said Frank Vogl, chief spokesman for Conable. ``But there are many
things we want to do for our member countries.''
   Also expected at the Madrid meeting is E. Gerald Corrigan,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The federal
reserve would have an important role in making the changes in
official regulations that U.S. banks would like to see as part of a
debt-forgiveness package.
   Another witness, Eugene H. Rotberg, executive vice president of
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. and former vice president of the World
Bank, said debt reduction will not reduce the amount of interest
countries would pay from their own resources, unless the reduction
is greater than new loans the banks will be asked to make.
   ``The fact is, in recent years, many debtors have met only about
half of their debt service obligations _ the balance comes from the
banks themselves (as new loans),'' Rotberg added.
   Last year debtor countries paid out $26 billion as interest,
Gejdenson said, adding that the United States and other major
governments had helped by underwriting the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund.

<HEAD>Strong Thunderstorms Over Wyoming and From Iowa To Michigan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong thunderstorms brought locally heavy rain, hail and a
tornado to the upper Midwest on Tuesday, and in Wyoming
thunderstorms produced several tornadoes or funnel clouds.
   Thunderstorms extended from eastern Iowa to central and southern
Wisconsin and southern Lake Michigan, producing locally heavy rain
and large hail. The storms developed in moist, unstable air along a
stationary front stretching from southwestern Kansas to northern
Iowa and southern Wisconsin.
   A tornado was spawned by a severe thunderstorm during the
morning near Bradford, Iowa.
   Hail 2 inches in diameter was reported in Prairie Du Chien,
Wis., and hail as big as golf balls fell in Bowler, Wis.
   One to 4 inches of rain fell from central Wisconsin into Lower
Michigan, causing highway and street flooding in Wisconsin's Fond
du Lac County.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell in sections of Utah, southern
Idaho and western Wyoming.
   At least four tornadoes or funnel clouds were reported over
southwestern Wyoming, but no damages or injuries were reported, the
National Weather Service said.
   Up to an inch of rain fell on the Wind River Mountains in
western Wyoming, and higher elevations received 3 to 5 inches of
snow.
   Scattered showers fell over the northern Plains, the Florida
Peninsula, the lower Great Lakes, and sections of the middle and
northern Atlantic Coast.
   Temperatures were only in the 40s and 50s from the Great Basin
containing Nevada and western Utah to the northern Rockies, the
northern Plains, northern and western Nebraska, the upper
Mississippi Valley and the upper Great Lakes.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Pocatello, Idaho, to 98 at Carlsbad, N.M. Tuesday
morning's low in the 48 contiguous states was 19 at Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from New England to the upper Ohio Valley, the Great
Lakes, sections of the upper and middle Mississippi Valley and the
central Plains, and scattered showers across the northern Plains,
the central Rockies and the Great Basin.
   Highs were predicted in the 50s and 60s from the Great Basin and
the northern Rockies to the northern Plains and the upper
Mississippi Valley into Upper Michigan; in the 90s from inland
Southern California and the desert Southwest to the southern
Rockies, the southern Plains, much of Kansas, the lower Mississippi
and Missouri valleys, the southern half of the Ohio Valley and the
Gulf Coast states to the middle and southern Atlantic Coast; and in
the 70s and 80s across much of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Scientists, Arms Experts Urge Scrapping of Plutonium Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 29 scientists and arms control
experts called on Congress Tuesday to reconsider plans to build a
plant in Idaho to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons.
   In a letter to the chairmen of the House and Senate armed
services committees and other key legislators, the experts said the
plant is not needed for national security and would undermine U.S.
efforts to limit the spread of nuclear arms.
   The Bush administration is seeking authorization to begin
building a Special Isotope Separation Plant at the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory, near Idaho Falls. The plant would use a new
laser technology to convert fuel-grade plutonium from Energy
Department stockpiles to weapon-grade plutonium.
   The letter, dated May 26, was signed by Paul Leventhal,
president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a private group
concerned with nuclear proliferation problems.
   Among other signers were retired Adm. Thomas Davies, a former
assistant director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency;
Peter Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, and Peter Clausen, research director for the Union of
Concerned Scientists and a former CIA and Energy Department analyst.
   The group said it was concerned that the technology could spread
to other nations that could convert fuel-grade plutonium from
civilian plants to develop a nuclear arsenal. It also expressed
concern that the U.S. plant eventually could be used to purify
plutonium from U.S. commercial nuclear reactors, even though this
is specifically outlawed by the 1982 Atomic Energy Act.
   ``For both these reasons, going forward with the SIS plant could
severely compromise U.S. non-proliferation objectives,'' the letter
said.
   ``In view of the acknowledged surplus of plutonium in the U.S.
nuclear arsenal, there are no clear national security benefits that
offset the obvious nuclear proliferation and terrorism risks ...''
posed by use of the plant, they added.
   The isotope separation technology is still under development at
an Energy Department laboratory in California, although the
administration wants to break ground on the Idaho plant this year.

<HEAD>Radical Arab Group Leader Meets Iranian Official In Syria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ahmed Jibril, leader of a Palestinian
group U.S. officials suspect was behind the bombing of a Pan Am
jet, met Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati in Syria this
month, diplomatic sources said.
   The May 22 meeting came as Jibril's radical group, the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, renewed
denials it was involved in the Pan Am bombing Dec. 21 that killed
270 people.
   U.S. and other Western intelligence officials believe the
Popular Front carried out the bombing at Iran's request in
retaliation for the U.S. Navy's downing of an Iran Air jetliner
last July in the Persian Gulf. All 290 people aboard died.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Velayati
and Jibril discussed Iran's support for the Palestinian struggle
against Israel.
   They said Jibril asserted that armed struggle was the only way
the Palestinians will regain their homeland.
   Like Jibril and other Syrian-backed Palestinian leaders, Iran
has denounced PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's peace initiative,
renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel.
   The sources said Velayati was in Damascus, the Syrian capital,
for consultations with President Hafez Assad before last week's
Arab summit conference, which endorsed Arafat's initiative and
sought ways to end the Lebanese civil war.
   Jibril denies involvement in the Pan Am bombing. But he has said
his group makes bombs similar to the one investigators believed
exploded in the plane over Lockerbie, Scotland on a flight from
Frankfurt via London to New York.
   Iran also denies involvement.
   Popular Front spokesman Fahd Shrourou said on May 21 in Damascus
in decrying U.S. allegations: ``We're not agents for Iran or anyone
else. They didn't ask us. They're not allowed to ask us for such
things.''
   He said that ``American insistence on blaming us is because
they've failed to get any evidence'' firmly linking his group with
the Pan Am bombing.
   Diplomats and counterterrorism specialists believe Jibril and
Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal forged new links over
the last year with Iranian radicals and their Shiite Moslem allies
in Lebanon.
   The radical resurgence in Tehran; the confrontation with the
West over British author Salman Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic
Verses,'' which many Moslem say blasphemes Islam, and opposition by
hard-line Palestinian factions to Arafat's initiative by the
Palestine Liberation Organization would provide fertile ground for
such an alliance.
   Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani asked Palestinians
this month to kill five Westerners for every Palestinian slain by
Israelis in the uprising in the occupied territories and to attack
Western targets.
   He later claimed he was misinterpreted. But his remarks were
seen as reflecting the militancy of radicals now ascendant in
Tehran.
   The diplomatic sources said evidence against the the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command in the Pan Am
sabotage ``is circumstantial, but it's there.''
   They cited the arrest of 14 Popular Front activists in West
Germany last October, including a top Jibril lieutenant, Kassem
Dalkamoni.
   The men had Czechoslovak-made Semtex explosives hidden in a
candy wrapper and a bomb hidden in a Japanese-made cassette radio
linked to a barometric device.
   Investigators have concluded the Pan Am bomb contained Semtex,
was hidden in a cassette radio packed in a suitcase and was
triggered by a barometric sensor.
   Popular Front officials said the men arrested in West Germany
were heading for the Middle East to attack Israeli targets.
   Shrourou said: ``We don't carry out attacks in Europe because
that would have a negative effect on the support of the EEC
(European Economic Community) nations for the Palestinian
struggle.''
   However, Western European governments have generally supported
Arafat's efforts to negotiate a settlement with Israel, a move
Jibril and his fellow radicals consider a betrayal of the
Palestinian cause.
   Diplomats and counterterrorism specialists doubt the Popular
Front's claim it would not hit targets in Europe.
   Police in Sweden last week arraigned three men they said were
linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command for suspected complicity in the 1985 bombing of a Danish
synagogue and similar attacks on U.S. and Israeli airline offices
in Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Potential candidates began lining up quickly during the Memorial
Day holiday weekend to vie for the chance to succeed Rep. Tony
Coelho, the House Majority Whip from California who announced he is
resigning.
   But while House Speaker Jim Wright is thought to be planning to
resign in the face of an ethics investigation, the GOP chairman in
Wright's home county in Texas says that if the Democrat decided to
stay in office, it's unlikely anyone could oust him from the seat
he has held 34 years.
   A special election will be required to fill the San Joaquin
Valley congressional seat Coelho, a Democrat, is vacating.
   Democratic Assemblymen Gary Condit of Ceres, Jim Costa of Fresno
and Rusty Areias of Los Banos haven't said either yes or no yet,
but Condit and Costa at least are expected to run.
   On the Republican side, Modesto Mayor Carol Whiteside is firmly
in the race, and Assemblyman Bill Jones and Fresno County District
Attorney Ed Hunt are considering running for the office.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian will schedule a special
election in the 5th Congressional District, probably in late August
or early September, with a runoff, if needed, during the November
general election.
   In Wright's case, the Texas Democrat probably has a safe seat in
Congress as long as he wants it, despite the ethics investigation
that some say could force him to resign, says Steve Hollern,
chairman of the Tarrant County GOP.
   The Republican Party made its last concerted effort to oust
Wright in 1980, winning just 39 percent of the vote, and Wright had
no opposition when he sought re-election last year, months after
the ethics probe was launched.
   ``I think if Jim Wright decides not to stay in Congress ... the
whole ball game changes,'' Hollern said Tuesday. ``If he stays
there, I don't think we can beat him.''
   Wright has been charged with 69 violations of House rules. He
said Tuesday he will announce this week whether he will resign.
   In Congress, Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., currently the
majority leader, is the only candidate to replace Wright as speaker
if the Texan gives up the job.
   A four-way contest is in the offing for Coelho's job as majority
whip. Reps. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., chairman of the House
Democratic Caucus; Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., the chief deputy whip, are all actively campaigning for
the post. Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., a powerful member of the
Energy and Commerce Committee, also was eyeing the race.

   Twenty thousand fans lit candles
in a soccer stadium as Stevie Wonder brought pop rock to Prague in
a three-hour recital during his ``Peace Conversations'' tour.
   The blind American singer sang old hits such as ``Jammin,''
``Superstition'' and ``I Just Called To Say I Love You,'' as well
as several tunes from his forthcoming album ``Peace Conversations.''
   ``I never imagined people will listen to my music here,'' Wonder
told journalists Monday night before his concert. ``This music
speaks of love and united culture,'' he said.
   Wonder's tour, including West Germany, Scandinavia, Greece and
Austria, also takes in three communist bloc countries.
   Wonder played Saturday to thousands in Warsaw.
   The tour was to take the singer-songwriter to Bratislava, the
Slovak capital on Tuesday, and Budapest, Hungary, on June 9.
   ``I am for equality _ social, political and economic _ and if
there are concerts that speak of these issues, I'm all the way
there,'' Wonder said at the news conference.

   A protester was reported killed and
several were injured Tuesday during a confrontation with police in
Kosovo province, where more than two dozen people have died in
ethnic violence this year.
   A delegation from the European Parliament visited the southern
province to assess human rights abuses there.
   Tanjug, the official news agency, said the delegation would meet
with officials of the predominantly ethnic Albanian province about
human rights violations under a state of emergency imposed after
riots by ethnic Albanians in February and March.
   It said police and demonstrators used firearms Tuesday in
Podujevo, 20 miles north of Pristina, the provincial capital.
   About 50 ethnic Albanians were involved in the protest, Tanjug
said, but sources in the area said there were 80 people, some
carrying banners or Albanian flags.
   The Tanjug report did not give the number of people injured or
say whether the person killed was shot to death. It said protesters
hurled stones at police.
   ``Because of the aggressive behavior of the demonstrators, the
policemen were forced to intervene,'' Tanjug said. ``Witnesses said
both sides used firearms.''
   A source said privately it was believed to be the largest
Albanian protest in two months. Emergency measures imposed after
the February-March riots forbid public gatherings of more than
three people.
   Tanjug said earlier the five-member European Parliament
delegation, led by Julian Grimaldos of Spain, met on Sunday in
Belgrade with senior officials of the Serbian republic. Kosovo is
an automous province within Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic.
   Ethnic Albanians, about 85 percent of Kosovo's 1.8 million
people, oppose constitutional changes made by Serbia that give it
greater say in the province's affairs.
   Serbia says the amendments were necessary to protect minority
Slavs from what they describe as harassment and persecution by
ethnic Albanians.
   At least 24 people, including two policemen, were killed and
hundreds wounded in the riots earlier this year. About 800 ethnic
Albanians were arrested.
   Official sources say 237 other ethnic Albanians, including
former provincial Communist Party chief Azem Vllasi and other
prominent politicians, businessmen and intellectuals, were detained
without charges under national emergency laws.
   ``We have not been informed whether the delegation plans to
contact any of the detainees,'' Francoise Blondel, a spokesman for
the European Commission, told The Associated Press. He said
Yugoslav authorities prepared the delegation's agenda.

<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia Council on Tuesday
passed emergency legislation designed to prevent the extradition of
a teen-ager facing a possible death sentence in Alabama.
   Supporters of the measure, which will remain in effect for 90
days, said it was needed because of uncertainty over whether the
district's ban on capital punishment could be used to block
extradition of juvenile suspects facing a possible death sentence.
That question is now before a district court.
   The 17-year-old teen-ager, identified only by the initials O.M.,
could face murder and arson charges in connection with an April
1988 firebombing of a Gadsen, Ala., apartment that took the life of
a 14-month-old boy. The teen-ager is being held here pending a
decision on Alabama's extradition request.
   During more than three hours of debate Tuesday, supporters of
the measure said a jurisdiction that bans capital punishment should
not subject a suspect in its custody to the death penalty
elsewhere. Others also raised questions about whether the youth,
who is black, would receive a fair trial.
   ``It is reprehensible that a jurisdiction would even consider
applying a death penalty to a juvenile,'' said William Lightfoot, a
council member. ``That is not civilized conduct.''
   Another member, Nadine Winter, said that by refusing to
extradite the youth the district could gain a reputation as a
``haven'' for juveniles accused of serious crimes.
   At a recent court hearing, relatives of the teen-ager recounted
alleged racial abuse by Gadsen officials. Also reviewed at the
hearing were comments recently made to The Washington Post by the
county's only juvenile judge, Robert E. Lewis, in which Lewis
suggested he thought the teen-ager likely was involved in the
firebombing.
   The emergency legislation, which would apply only to O.M., was
sought after a recent court hearing left in doubt whether the
district's existing laws were sufficient to block the extradition.
   The teen-ager's attorney, Gerald Fisher, argued the district's
death penalty ban must be applied by district courts when
considering interstate juvenile extraditions.
   But Paul Alper, representing the district government, said a
nationwide juvenile extradition agreement does not give the
district discretion to approve or reject requests on the basis of
whether the juvenile might face the death penalty.
   A three-judge panel is considering the case but has not
indicated when it would rule. The Supreme Court has set precedent
in adult extradition cases but attorneys involved in the district
case said there has been no test case involving a juvenile before
the high court.

Lacey, who downed 18 enemy aircraft in the Battle of Britain, the
most for any pilot, and 27 planes in all during World War II, died
Tuesday, his widow said. He was 72.
   Lacey, who survived nine downings himself, was diagnosed as
having cancer of the throat four months ago and died at a hospital

survived by two daughters.
   The 18 planes that Lacey shot down during the 1940 battle
between British and German aircraft over London and southern
England included a Heinkel 111 aircraft returning from a successful
bombing raid on Buckingham Palace.
   Lacey was shot down nine times during the war while flying
Spitfire fighters as leader of 501 Squadron based near Kenley in
Surrey, and won the Distinguished Flying Medal and Bar, the Croix
de Guerre and other medals for courage.
   After the war, Lacey ran an air freight business and later
taught flying at an airfield near Bridlington in eastern England.

   Rep. Claude Denson Pepper, whose political
odyssey took him from the Senate to the House, spanned 53 years and
10 presidents, and made him the unrivaled champion of America's
senior citizens, died Tuesday. He was 88, and the oldest member of
Congress.
   Pepper had been hospitalized since April 6 suffering from an
undisclosed stomach ailment, which a spokesman in his office said
Tuesday was cancer. He died at Walter Reed Army Hospital, where he
returned a month ago after an interim stay at Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore.
   Tributes poured in.
   President Bush, on his European trip, said in a statement in
Bonn, West Germany: ``Claude Pepper gave definition and meaning to
the concept of public service. He fought for the poor and the
elderly in his own determined way. ... Claude Pepper was a
gentleman, a noble human being.''
   ``He will be greatly missed,'' said Rep. Charles Wilson,
D-Texas. ``But we should have the kind of life he had.''
   ``There has never been a greater friend and advocate for older
Americans,'' said Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``Claude Pepper was
and will always remain one of our national treasures.''
   Just last Thursday, Bush went to the hospital to present the
Presidential Medal of Freedom to Pepper, who was only the fourth
member of Congress to receive the award.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said Pepper ``obviously was wracked
with pain but was able to bring himself together'' and speak for 10
minutes. Obviously, there wasn't a dry eye in the place, including
those of the president.''
   Congress on Wednesday is to act on a resolution so that Pepper
could lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda on Thursday
   The Florida Democrat was elected to the Senate in 1936 as a
liberal crusader for Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. He promptly
made his mark as an architect of some of the nation's most enduring
``safety net'' programs, including Social Security, the minimum
wage, and medical assistance for the elderly and for handicapped
children.
   He remained in the Senate for 14 years, then _ after an
interlude practicing law and teaching following a bitter
re-election defeat _ began a House career that would include 14
terms.
   He was still going strong when he barnstormed the nation last
year in an effort to fend off Reagan budget cuts and elect to the
White House a fellow liberal, Michael Dukakis, who was all of 3
years old when Pepper first came to Congress. He had supported
Gephardt until the Missouri congressman dropped out.
   Pepper didn't have to campaign to win his most recent term in
the House. No one ran against him after he won with 74 percent of
the vote in 1986.
   Born poor in 1900 in rural Alabama, Pepper was the pre-eminent
eyewitness to America's turbulent journey through the 20th century.
He was 5 years old, in 1905, when he first saw an automobile. He
witnessed the passing of Halley's Comet in 1910, and again in 1986.
He met Orville Wright, and greeted the Apollo 11 crew on their
return to Earth.
   He stared Adolf Hitler down in a Nuremberg beer hall, sized up
Joseph Stalin at the Kremlin, and earned Winston Churchill's
undying affection for casting the only vote in the Senate for the
Lend-Lease Act the first time around.
   Among several leadership posts over the years, he was most
recently chairman of the Rules Committee, a position he took
because of its influence in deciding what bills would go to the
floor affecting the elderly and poor.
   Pepper also gained prominence as chairman of the House Select
Committee on Aging, an advisory forum that he unabashedly used to
draw public attention to the problems of old people. He was
instrumental in the passage of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage
Act of 1988.
   One of Pepper's proudest accomplishments was a law that bars
forced retirement. He was the principal author and driving force
behind the law, passed in 1986, which makes it illegal for
employers of more than 20 workers to require retirement at any age
and orders continued health coverage for older workers.
   His own advice to the older set was to ``keep on doing what
you're doing,'' but maybe at a slower pace.
   ``I was playing golf one day,'' he said a few years back, ``when
I noticed my partner's clubs were lighter than mine. I found I
could handle them easier. So I changed to less weighty clubs.
   ``So that's what you do in life,'' he said. ``When you come to a
time when there's a need for any sort of change, simply lighten
your clubs and go right ahead.''
   In recent years, Pepper pushed hard for legislation to provide
federal money for long-term home health care, but colleagues
defeated the ``Pepper bill'' last June, finding a procedural way to
do it so as to spare his feelings as much as possible.
   In his final years, he dug in his heels against cutting Social
Security benefits to elderly retired workers _ half a century after
campaigning for establishment of the retirement program.
   His Senate career ended in 1950 after a campaign which saw him
branded as ``Red Pepper'' _ playing on claims during the communist
scare of the era that he was soft on the Soviet Union. A fellow
Democrat, George Smathers, took his place.
   Pepper was elected to the House from the Miami district in 1962.
He was never defeated again, largely because of his dogged
attention to retirees in a city heavily populated by them.
   His florid, finger-wagging lectures at committee hearings
reflected the politics of the old rural South where he had his
roots. Often he faced news cameras like a TV star as he raked a
recalcitrant witness over the coals.
   He wore thick, horn-rimmed trifocal glasses and was all but deaf
without his hearing aids, one for each ear. He underwent heart
surgery in 1976 for a valve replacement, and again in 1982, to have
a pacemaker implanted.
   Pepper, who stood 5-foot-7{ and weighed 180 pounds, had strands
of thin white hair. For a while he wore a toupee but quit in 1980
after it blew off during an appearance with then-President Carter.
   Early in his political career, Pepper co-sponsored repeal of
poll taxes _ often used to bar poor blacks from voting _ even
though Florida at the time was hostile to racial change.
   In the late 1930s, he attended a Nuremberg conference and
returned to the United States convinced that Hitler had to be
stopped. He pushed for the draft, and massive military assistance
to Great Britain while isolationist fever still gripped the nation.
He was hanged in effigy on the Capitol lawn by irate mothers, who
called him a warmonger. After the war, conservatives accused him of
not being hawkish enough against the Soviet Union.
   He was the first national legislator to push publicly for
federal funding for the war against cancer, a disease that took his
wife, Mildred in 1979, some 43 years after they were married. They
had no children.

   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter,
touring drought-stricken southern Iowa on Tuesday, said conditions
were better than he expected but that didn't mean ``folks are out
of the woods.''
   Yeutter said pastures he saw were not as good as normal, but
added that dry weather has hit other areas harder.
   ``The drought situation in the other states is more severe than
it is in Iowa,'' Yeutter said. ``In a relative sense, the pasture
conditions out West are much more troubling than they are here.''
   Yeutter visited the area after being briefed by a special
drought task force. He also watched the Iowa National Guard hauling
water.
   The Cabinet official's tour came as heavy thunderstorms rumbled
across other sections of Iowa, following holiday weekend rains
throughout the state.
   ``In terms of crop conditions and pasture conditions, I would
say overall they do look better that I expected,'' Yeutter said.
``That doesn't mean folks are out of the woods. It's dramatically
improved from what it was a couple of weeks ago.''
   Yeutter said a decision on opening fragile set-aside acres for
grazing would come very soon.
   ``Today isn't the time to do that,'' he said. ``The time to do
that is after we've had some time to assess the rainfall in recent
days. This has been a strange weather year all over the United
States.''
   For conservation purposes, the government pays farmers not to
farm set-aside land. During last summer's drought, some set-aside
land was opened up for grazing or hay harvesting.
   State officials said Tuesday that subsoil moisture and
groundwater supplies are dangerously low, but said it's too early
to determine if corn and soybeans will be damaged.
   Yeutter said Kansas' winter wheat crop has been devastated by
dry weather.
   He offered little hope of a big drought aid package this year.
``We have to be careful we don't overestimate the problem,'' he
said.
   Yeutter trudged across farms near Afton, about 75 miles
southwest of Des Moines, touring cattle farms. Officials said
cattle farmers face the most immediate danger because ponds are
drying up and hay has been scorched in the fields.
   State officials had a trench dug to illustrate their point that
soil moisture levels are low.
   ``I think he understands,'' said Gov. Terry Branstad. ``He's a
farmer from Nebraska and he understands that just because we got a
little rain in the last couple of weeks, it doesn't mean the
drought's over.''
   Branstad asked Yeutter to open acres for grazing and give more
money for rural water systems.
   Yeutter held out little hope of quick federal assistance, noting
that water projects are expensive. Two projects that state
officials pushed him to approve cost $11 million, and his total
budget for such efforts is $4 million, Yeutter said.

   The parents of 11-day-old quintuplets say they
don't quite know how they're going to adjust. They just know
they're going to have to.
   ``We've now realized we have five,'' Jeri Chandler, 29, said at
a news conference with her husband, Peter, 36, and their son,
Zachary, 4. ``It's still a little bit dreamlike.''
   The five babies _ born as the result of in vitro, or
``test-tube,'' fertilization _ will remain in the hospital for six
weeks.
   Joshua, Heidi, Meagan, Amanda and Emily Chandler were born May
20, nine weeks prematurely.
   The Chandlers' three-bedroom house on the campus of the private
Alexander Dawson School in Lafayette, where Peter Chandler is
athletic director, is being rearranged to fit the expanded family.
The master bedroom already has been turned into a nursery.
   ``We're going to make it big enough,'' Mrs. Chandler said.
   A list of volunteers to feed, diaper and bathe the babies, clean
house and run errands has grown to nearly 60, she said.
   ``I am confident we have enough,'' she said. ``I know we're
going to have to be ultra-organized.''
   Companies have donated diapers, baby food and formula for the
quints, Mrs. Chandler said.

<TEXT>
   Congressional colleagues and elected officials
from around the country saluted Rep. Claude D. Pepper on Tuesday as
a tireless and tenacious advocate for the poor and elderly during a
more than half-century career in public service.
   ``In the bosom of that small, gentle man beat the heart of a
giant _ a heart that felt the pain of a world where children go to
sleep hungry and where the old die alone,'' Rep. Joe Moakley,
D-Mass., said shortly after the longtime Florida Democratic
congressman died at Walter Reed Army Hospital.
   President Bush took time out from a state dinner in Bonn, West
Germany, to salute Pepper, to whom Bush presented a Medal of
Freedom during a hospital visit last week.
   ``Claude Pepper gave definition and meaning to the concept of
public service,'' Bush said. ``He fought for the poor and the
elderly in his own determined way. Those who agreed with him were
proud to follow his banner. Those who disagreed with him always
respected him. Claude Pepper was a gentleman, a noble human being.
America will miss him. Barbara and I will miss him, too.''
   Former President Reagan, in a statement issued in California,
said, ``The lives of millions of Americans are better because of
Claude Pepper's work. He was a patriot who loved his country and he
will be deeply missed.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright said he expected the House and Senate
to adopt a resolution on Wednesday clearing the way for Pepper to
lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda on Thursday.
   ``For longer than the rest of us, he was a moving force in
American life,'' Wright said. ``He was always a voice for the
voiceless and a helping hand for the helpless,'' he said.
   Such sentiments were echoed by officials from Pepper's home
state of Florida and by his friends and colleagues in Congress,
where at 88 he was the oldest member. All spoke of his commitment
and inspiration to the elderly. Others spoke of his tireless
advocacy of other causes as well. Some commented on the mark he
left on them.
   ``Like all Floridians, I am deeply saddened by the death of
Claude Pepper,'' Florida Gov. Bob Martinez said. ``The sense of
loss we all feel is softened by the warm memory of a lifetime full
of achievements on behalf of all people. ... Through his words and
through his actions, Claude Pepper proved that older Americans need
not slow down, need not stop contributing, need not give up on
improving their lives and those of others. He was a rare human
being and we are all richer for his presence among us.''
   Florida's U.S. senators also paid homage to Pepper.
   ``Claude Pepper was one of America's political giants of this
century,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., adding: ``Throughout his
career, Pepper was a champion for justice _ for civil rights, for a
prepared America to defeat Nazi tyranny and for dignity for older
Americans. America will miss this champion, but we will honor his
memory by renewing our dedication to his ideals of justice and
human dignity.''
   Republican Sen. Connie Mack of Florida said: ``Congressman
Pepper will be missed _ not only by those of us who served with him
_ but by Americans everywhere whose lives are now better because of
his dedication and leadership. To say that Congressman Pepper was
an institution is an understatement of the commitment and
contribution he made to improving the lives of individual
Americans.''
   Horace B. Deets, executive director of the American Association
of Retired Persons, said of Pepper: ``More than anyone in our
lifetime, he helped us as a nation realize the contributions that
older Americans can make to our nation if given a chance.''
   Moakley was visiting Pepper last week when Bush presented Pepper
with the Medal of Freedom. Moakley said Pepper had summoned staff
members to his hospital bed to brief him on pending legislation.
   ``Claude was a fighter, and he died fighting,'' Moakley said.
   Many colleagues promised to advance Pepper's agenda.
   ``Congress has spent the past 50 years trying to keep up with
Claude Pepper and we will be spending many more years carrying on
his work,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. ``On issue after
issue, he was the conscience of Congress and the country.''
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said ``every American who believes in
integrity and honest public service will mourn his passing. ...
Claude Pepper leaves a legacy so alive and powerful that he is far
from lost.''
   Still others recalled Pepper's work dating back more than 50
years on the nation's major social programs.
   ``With his passing, so passes the last of the New Dealers who
reshaped our society with such programs as Social Security and,
later, Medicare,'' said Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif. ``Claude
Pepper embodied the hopes and aspirations of the American people to
build a better life for themselves by seeing to the needs of their
neighbors.''
   The tributes came from Democrats and Republicans alike.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., called Pepper's career
``certainly one of the most extraordinary in the history of
American politics. When Claude Pepper spoke on the floor of the
House during debate, the House was hushed, hanging on every
eloquent word. He was one of a kind and we will miss him.''
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, said that
Pepper ``gave of his energy and his support for the cause of older
Americans, not only because it was the right thing to do but
because it was part of his view of our nation that the care of
those who built it should remain a concern of those who inherit
it.''

   At least 449 people died in traffic accidents
during the three-day Memorial Day holiday weekend, police reports
from throughout the nation indicate.
   The National Safety Council had estimated that 370 to 470 people
would be killed on the nation's roads during the holiday.
   For counting purposes, the holiday period began at 6 p.m. local
time Friday and ended at midnight local time Monday.
   The highest toll was reported in California, where 57 people
lost their lives, followed by Florida with 30 reported traffic
deaths, Ohio with 29 and Texas with 26.
   Three states reported no fatalities: Delaware, North Dakota and
South Dakota.
   Last year, there were 404 traffic fatalities during the Memorial
Day weekend. The highest toll was recorded in 1968, when 629 people
died over a four-day weekend. The highest three-day toll for the
holiday was logged in 1969, when 597 people died.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev uncovered one of the
Kremlin's best-kept secrets Tuesday by disclosing that the Soviet
Union will spend about $118 billion on defense this year, about
four times what it previously acknowledged.
   ``I am announcing this real figure of military expenditures to
the Congress of People's Deputies: 77.3 billion rubles,'' the
Soviet president told the 2,250-member national parliament to gasps
of astonishment.
   Gorbachev pledged defense spending would be cut by 10 billion
rubles ($15.3 billion) by the end of 1991 as the Soviet Union
redirects its resources to revive the Soviet economy and ease world
tensions by reducing arms.
   ``Today we can ensure security by political and diplomatic
means,'' Gorbachev declared during an address on foreign and
domestic policy. ``This makes it possible to cut down on military
expenditures ... without any detriment to the defense capability of
our country.''
   The Central Intelligence Agency estimates annual Soviet defense
spending at 115 billion to 125 billion rubles, roughly equivalent
to Pentagon expenditures of $300 billion, Richard Kaufman, an
expert with the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said in
Washington.
   In Gorbachev's 95-minute address to the Congress on the state of
the country's foreign and domestic policy, he also:
   _ Proposed creation of a special legislative commission to
review the decades-old system of privileges for the elite.
   _ Acknowledged complaints that government ministries ``are
restructuring very slowly, if at all,'' and urged deputies to
question government ministers on why they are dragging their feet
on reforms,
   _ Announced local elections will be postponed from fall to the
spring of 1990 to give lawmakers a chance to correct problems in
the electoral system that arose during the spring campaign.
   _ Pledged that the ruling Communist Party he heads is open to
talks with any social group or organization backing reform.
   He also outlined a system of legislative oversight that would
invest the full-time legislature, or the Supreme Soviet, and
national parliament with broad powers to change the constitution,
question government officials and review state spending.
   Gorbachev said the Supreme Soviet should create a commission
that would act as a constitutional court to ensure the transition
to a nation ruled by law and respectful of individual rights.
   His moves seemed aimed at creating expert, policy-making bodies
independent of the Communist Party bureaucrats who have run the
country for decades and whom Gorbachev blames for slowing his
reforms.
   Leonid I. Abalkin, director of the official Economics Institute,
said Gorbachev's surprise disclosure on Soviet defense spending was
aimed at ending distrust in East-West arms reductions talks caused
by decades of Kremlin secrecy.
   As recently as October, allocations for the Soviet military in
the official 1989 government budget were listed to be the same as
in 1988: 20.2 billion rubles ($32 billion).
   Gorbachev did not say what his ``real figure'' embraced, but
Maj. Gen. Vladimir Kuklev, deputy chairman of the General Staff,
told a news briefing the sum ``includes expenses for purchasing
weapons ... as well as research and development.''
   Abalkin indicated some government operations with military
applications, such as space programs, still were not included in
the new figure.
   Gorbachev's announcement is unlikely to settle the question of
how much money the Soviets spend on defense. Many questions remain
about how the price of Soviet weapons are set, and the official
exchange rate for the ruble, which makes the 77.3-billion-ruble
defense budget equal to $118 billion, artificially inflates the
value of the ruble.
   Abalkin said Soviet defense spending was about 9 percent of the
country's gross national product, the sum of all goods and services
produced. Asked why previous official figures were much lower, he
said they represented only ``what we could call the budget of the
Ministry of Defense'' and not appropriations for ministries in
charge of producing weaponry.
   The Washington think tank PlanEcon has figured Soviet defense
spending at 122 billion rubles, or 13 percent of GNP. The U.S.
defense budget, by comparison, is $300 billion or 6 percent of its
much larger GNP.
   Gorbachev announced in a Dec. 7, 1988, address to the United
Nations that the Soviet armed forces would be unilaterally reduced
by a half-million men to 3.7 million. He later said there would be
a 12 percent reduction in military manpower, a 14.2 percent cut in
the defense budget and a 19.5 percent cut in weapons production.
   But Western leaders continued to question the impact of the
promised cuts, pointing to what they regarded as unrealistic Soviet
defense spending figures. Gorbachev's speech was coolly received by
Communist Party maverick Boris N. Yeltsin.
   ``I was expecting something new, something entirely and
radically new that would take into account the crisis state of
society and the party,'' the former Moscow party leader said in an
interview.
   More than 400 Congress deputies, including Yeltsin and human
rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, asked for an opportunity to
reply to Gorbachev's speech, and deputies trooped to the
microphones Tuesday, mostly to offer their own points of view on
issues of concern to their constituents, rather than to respond
directly to the president's remarks.
   The debate later Tuesday over the April 9 military action
against a pro-independence demonstration in the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi aroused far more passion than Gorbachev's speech.
   Tamaz Gamkrelidze, director of Georgia's Institute of Eastern
Studies, won stormy applause after demanding that Col. Gen. Igor
Rodionov, Caucasus military commander, be ousted from the Congress
for the assault.
   At least 19 people died in the clash with soldiers and another
was shot to death that night.

   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens, convicted of
having sex with a 16-year-old girl, plans an announcement on his
personal and political future by the end of the week, his chief of
staff said Tuesday.
   ``He has a couple more folks to meet with before he makes any
decision about that. At this point, I stand by my statement that he
will run again,'' William Jarrell said in a telephone interview
from the congressman's Washington office.
   Lukens' two-year term expires in 1990. His misdemeanor
conviction does not make him ineligible to seek office again.
   Lukens, 58, was convicted Friday on a charge of contributing to
the delinquency and unruliness of a minor. The four-term Republican
faces a maximum of 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Thomas Tyack, Lukens' attorney, has said he will appeal.
   U.S. Rep. Chalmers Wylie, senior Republican in Ohio's
congressional delegation, on Friday called on Lukens to resign,
saying it would be the ``gentlemanly thing to do.''
   Jarrell said Lukens spent much of Tuesday _ his first day back
on the job after the trial _ talking with constituents and meeting
with legislative aides ``to find out what's happening as far as his
legislative work goes and what he missed last week.''

   The mayor of the Jewish settlement of Ariel in
the occupied West Bank said Tuesday Palestinians working in the
town will be required to wear ``alien worker'' tags.
   Some members of Parliament condemned the plan, comparing it to
the yellow Stars of David that Jews were forced to wear in Nazi
Germany.
   Plans to control Arabs also were reported or underway in two
Jewish suburbs of Tel Aviv.
   In Petah Tikva construction began on an encampment for Arab
workers outside the town. Municial officials in Ramat Gan were
considering an ordinance to ban all Arab workers.
   Ariel Mayor Ron Nachman said in an interview the tag system was
adopted for security reasons.
   He said Palestinians working in Ariel would undergo daily
security checks and then would be issued tags identifying them as
``alien workers.''
   ``We don't have any control over the hundreds of Arabs who come
every day,'' he said. ``We want to be sure that no terrorists enter
Ariel. Getting a job is a privilege, not a right.''
   Nachman said about 400 Palestinians work in construction and
municipal services in Ariel, which has a population of 8,000. Those
workers are threatened by other Arabs who want to stop them from
assisting the Jewish settlers, and they ``deserve protection,'' he
added.
   The plan was denounced in Parliament during a debate on the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   ``Those who give tags to the Arabs walk around freely,'' said
Yossi Sarid of the Citizens' Rights Movement. ``I just hope these
tags aren't yellow.''
   ``They are yellow,'' said Shulamit Aloni of Sarid's party
speaking on Israel television. ``I'm amazed they just propose a
tag, why shouldn't we tattoo their skin?''
   About 6 million Jews perished in the Nazi Holocaust, and many of
the victims and survivors had concentration camp numbers tattooed
on their arms.
   Twenty-five legislators from seven parties signed a petition
demanding that the government denounce Nachman's step.
   Among the signers were members of the right-wing Likud bloc of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, lawmakers from the leftist Labor
Party and even members of the nationalist Tsomet party, Israel
radio reported.
   There have been various efforts to control the movement of about
110,000 Arabs working in Israel since the uprising began in
December 1988.
   After stone-throwing battles in the southern Israeli towns of
Ashkelon and Ashdod the army on May 15 ordered all 50,000 Gazans
who were employed in Israel to return to the Gaza Strip.
   Shmuel Goren, Israel's coordinator for the occupied lands, said
Gazans would be given a special permit for work in Israel and the
system probably would be expanded to cover the estimated 60,000
West Bank Arabs who work in Israel.
   Petah Tikva Mayor Giora Lev said construction is to be completed
by the end of the week for the encampment for Arab workers being
built in the Sgula industrial zone at the entrance to the Tel Aviv
suburb.
   He said the camp will be equipped with running water and toilet
facilities.
   Palestinians will be banned from Petah Tikva unless they are
brought in from the encampment ty Jewish employers.
   ``I think it's for the benefit of the public,'' Lev said.
``Everybody says it's about time we impose some order. The
residents ....don't want to see them (Arabs) in their courtyards,
inside their houses. And we had four bombs in the last three
months.''

   A woman's body was pulled Tuesday from the
Great Miami River in the first recovery of a victim from the bridge
collapse last week that dropped at least two vehicles into the
rain-swollen river.
   Four people are still missing, officials believe.
   Recovery teams using sonar detected what appeared to be two
vehicles resting on the river's bottom near the bridge. The current
was too strong to allow divers into the water.
   ``We probably won't send the divers in until Thursday,'' said
Hamilton County Sheriff Simon Leis Jr..
   The woman's body was found about five miles downstream from the
bridge, snagged in debris about 40 feet from shore, said Hamilton
County sheriff's Col. Ray Hoffbauer.
   Authorities did not release her name.
   A 100-foot section of the one-lane bridge collapsed Friday about
seven miles northwest of Cincinnati.
   The bridge opened Dec. 15 to temporarily replace a 94-year-old
bridge being rebuilt a few feet away. Officials said river currents
and pounding from debris probably caused the collapse.
   The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.

   Divorced spouses of military veterans suffered
a Supreme Court defeat Tuesday when the justices shielded some
retirement pay from alimony payments.
   By a 7-2 vote in a California case, the court said a 1982
federal law exempts from alimony any military retirement pay that a
veteran converts into disability benefits.
   The court also said the law requires that the alimony a military
veteran is ordered to provide must be calculated on after-taxes
income, not gross pay.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said Congress
is free to change the law.
   But until that happens, a lawyer in the case said that more than
a million divorce settlements could be reopened.
   In other action, the court:
   _Refused to lift strict advertising limits imposed on a Texas
counseling center that authorities called a ``fake abortion
clinic'' run by anti-abortion activists. The center was found to
have enticed women there with misleading ads so counselors could
urge them to continue their pregnancy.
   _Let stand a ruling that bans organized prayers at the start of
high school football games in Georgia, Alabama and Florida. A lower
court ruled that such pregame invocations impermissibly promote
religion.
   _Agreed to consider reviving a federal lawsuit stemming from the
collapse of the Old Court Savings &amp; Loan Association in Maryland.
   _Ruled 7-2 that Florida's death penalty law does not have to
require juries, instead of judges, to make the specific findings
authorizing imposition of capital punishment.
   _Ruled 8-0 against mining companies seeking to revive a 5
percent cap on the royalties they pay to help finance Arizona
public schools.
   In the divorce case, organizations representing more than 1.2
million military personnel had urged the justices to shield the
disability pay from divorce decrees.
   The court said Tuesday's ruling ``may inflict economic harm on
many former spouses.'' But Marshall said, ``We decline to misread
the statute ... to reach a sympathetic result when such a reading
requires us to do violence to the plain language ... and ignore
much of the legislative history.''
   He added that the 1982 law is aimed at dividing only a veteran's
``disposable'' retirement pay _ the net amount of money received
each month.
   Excluded from that figure, Marshall said, is money the veteran
chooses to convert into tax-exempt disability benefits as well as
any taxes paid on the military pension.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in a dissenting opinion, said,
``The harsh reality of this holding is that former spouses ... can,
without their consent, be denied a fair share of their ex-spouse's
military pension simply because he elects to (convert) a portion of
that pension into disability benefits.''
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined O'Connor in dissent.
   The case stems from the 1979 divorce of Gerald and Gaye Mansell
after 25 years of marriage.
   Mansell, a retired Air Force major, receives $1,200 a month in
retirement pay and $482 in disability benefits.
   The amount of disability pay veterans may receive is based on
the seriousness of the disability and the resulting impairment on
their ability to work. Veterans commonly choose to convert part of
their pensions into disability pay because the latter is tax-exempt.
   The Mansells' divorce settlement, filed in Merced County,
Calif., awarded Mrs. Mansell half the retirement pay in an
uncontested split of that money. The decree also gave her half the
disability benefits.
   But Mansell went to court in 1983 to modify the divorce decree
and exclude the disability pay. The California courts rejected his
request.
   California is a community property state, meaning property
acquired during marriage is considered jointly owned.
   Tuesday's ruling also applies to states that split up property
for divorced couples based on a theory of ``equitable
distribution.''
   The decision focused on the law Congress passed to reverse a
1981 Supreme Court decision that barred state courts from dividing
military pensions in divorces.
   The 1982 law, called the Uniformed Services Former Spouses
Protection Act, allows retirement pay to be subjected to alimony
awards.
   The Justice Department, which sided initially with Mrs. Mansell,
changed its mind late last year and concluded that her former
husband's interpretation of the 1982 law was correct.
   Dennis Cornell, Mrs. Mansell's lawyer, said the decision could
allow more than a million ex-members of the armed services to
reopen their divorce cases and try to reduce the alimony they pay.
   He said many divorce settlements have been based on a veteran's
gross retirement pay.
   ``I'm hopeful Congress will act'' to undo the decision, Cornell
said.
   The National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education
Fund called the ruling a ``cruel blow'' for those who seek alimony
payments from military retirees ``who seek to avoid obligations to
their former families.''

   U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper was remembered
Tuesday by admirers and political foes alike as a ``rare human
being'' who championed the rights of the elderly and poor and led
Florida into the modern era.
   ``The sense of loss we all feel is softened by the warm memory
of a lifetime full of achievements on behalf of all people,'' Gov.
Bob Martinez said shortly after it was announced that Pepper, 88,
had died in Washington.
   ``He was a rare human being and we are all richer for his
presence among us,'' Martinez said. ``We will miss him very much.''
   Pepper represented the 18th Congressional District, which covers
most of Miami and all of Miami Beach, Bal Harbour and Key Biscayne.
Its center is Miami's heavily Cuban Eighth Street, or Calle Ocho,
and 50 percent of the district is Hispanic.
   A special election will be held to fill Pepper's seat, but it
could not be held for at least 40 days because of the minimum
intervals for filing and two primary elections that would have to
be held.
   Tributes came from all over Florida, which Pepper watched grow
from mostly rural land into the nation's fourth most-populous state
and which became home to many of the senior citizens whose cause he
championed.
   ``He always said it was the senior citizens who made this
country great,'' said Leila Johnson, a resident of Mildred and
Claude Pepper Towers, a federally subsidized senior-citizen
apartment complex named for Pepper and his late wife.
   Mrs. Johnson said she never really understood how she could be
important until she heard Pepper outline his belief that, after
working to raise and educate their children, senior citizens like
her are still contributing to society.
   ``In my life, he made me think that maybe I did make a
contribution,'' said Mrs. Johnson, 74. ``He really made me feel
important.''
   Sen. Bob Graham praised his fellow Florida Democrat as ``a
champion for justice _ for civil rights, for a prepared America to
defeat Nazi tyranny and for dignity for older Americans.''
   ``America will miss this champion,'' Graham said, ``but we will
honor his memory by renewing our dedication to his ideals of
justice and human dignity.''
   Republican Sen. Connie Mack recalled that Pepper once served
with his maternal grandfather, Morris Sheppard, who represented
Texas in the Senate for 42 years.
   ``Congressman Pepper will be missed _ not only by those of us
who served with him _ but by Americans everywhere whose lives are
now better because of his dedication and leadership,'' Mack said.
   ``Senator Pepper was as old as this century, yet he was perhaps
the first of our modern leaders for the new Florida,'' said Florida
House Speaker Tom Gustafson.
   ``When you consider he was a man who knew Orville Wright and
welcomed the astronauts back from the moon, you have an
understanding of the span of history he represented,'' said
Democratic state Sen. Jack Gordon of Miami Beach, Pepper's friend
for 30 years.

   Israeli soldiers and allied militiamen killed a
guerrilla Tuesday who apparently was trying to cross the border
into Israel, the army reported.
   Israel radio said police were questioning 20 students at a
Hebrew study center in Nablus about an attack by Jewish settlers on
a West Bank village Monday in which a 13-year-old girl was shot to
death.
   Leaders of the Ariel settlement, founded in the occupied West
Bank in 1977, said Palestinians who work there will have to wear
tags identifying them as ``alien workers.''
   Soldiers wounded at least 15 Palestinians in the occupied
territories _ nine in the Gaza Strip and six in the West Bank _
according to Arab hospital officials.
   Arab reports said 8-month-old Mohammed Hamdan was hit in the
head by a plastic bullet when Israeli soldiers dispersed a march by
about 350 West Bank Palestinians in Tulkarem refugee camp. He was
reported in critical condition at Muqassed Hospital in east
Jerusalem.
   In south Lebanon, a guerrilla wearing military camouflage was
spotted by Israeli soldiers and allied South Lebanon Army
militiamen east of Marjayoun, an army statement said.
   He was wounded in an exchange of gunfire, then was pursued and
killed by the militia, it said. One militiaman was slightly wounded.
   Army sources said he was a Palestinian trying to infiltrate
Israel. Middle East Television, run by the U.S.-based Christian
Broadcasting Network, said the guerrilla was a survivor of a squad
intercepted Sunday in the ``security zone'' Israel maintains just
north of its border.
   Two guerrillas were killed Sunday and two were wounded and
captured after Katyusha rockets were fired into the Israeli border
town of Matulla, slightly wounding an infant.
   Israel radio said 20 young settlers from the study center in
Nablus were being questioned about the attack on nearby Kifil
Harith in which Ibtisam Bozieh became the 500th Palestinian killed
in the uprising against Israeli rule that began Dec. 8, 1987.
Twenty-two Israelis also have been slain.
   Members of the student group said they were hiking to a
religious shrine in Kifil Harith when Palestinians began throwing
stones. Police reports said the students set fires in grain fields
outside the village and appeared to start shooting as soon as they
entered the village.
   The rampage in Kifil Harith was the latest retaliatory action by
settlers against Palestinian stonings or firebombings.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told a Parliament committee it
was the job of the police and army to enforce the law.
   He noted that many of the 70,000 Jewish settlers have been given
weapons for protection, but added: ``They are ... forbidden to take
the laws into their own hands and carry out punishment raids.''
   Daniella Weiss, a leader of the settlers' Gush Emunim movement,
told Israel radio the Jews were being provoked to take action.
   ``If people react to attacks by Arabs, they should be praised
for it, and no one should speak against it,'' she said.
   The U.S. government condemned vigilante attacks by Jewish
settlers.
   ``We note the Israeli government's views that there could be `no
justification for people taking the law into their own hands.' We
certainly agree with that,'' State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said in Washington.
   In Ariel, near Kifil Harith, Mayor Ron Nachmann said in a
telephone interview that the Palestinian workers would undergo a
daily security check before being issued tags identifying them as
``alien workers.''
   ``We want to be sure that no terrorists enter Ariel,'' Nachmann
said.
   About 400 Palestinians work in Ariel, a settlement of more than
8,000 Israelis. The Palestinians are mainly residents of the West
Bank, which was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East War.
   The tag policy was announced on Tuesday and is believed to be
the first of its kind in Israel.
   In the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah-Tikva, officials have begun
building an ``encampment'' for Arab workers. They are supposed to
be taken to and from work by employers without being allowed to
walk the streets freely.

<TEXT>
   State television aired a Solidarity
election program Tuesday featuring a former U.S. presidential
adviser and a comedian instructing voters how to choose candidates
in the June 4 election.
   It was followed immediately by an official commentator who
indirectly criticized Zbigniew Brzezinski, an adviser to former
President Jimmy Carter.
   The start of the Solidarity broadcast was delayed for 18 minutes
by the coverage of an election rally for Prime Minister Mieczyslaw
F. Rakowski.
   Brzezinski, seated in front of a Solidarity banner, said a truly
democratic Poland could benefit from ties with other democracies in
Europe.
   At the end of the Solidarity program an unidentified commentator
said, ``You just watched an interview with Zbigniew Brzezinski.
   ``We believe people who think in a proper way will assess
properly this interference in the Polish election campaign.''
   Poland's communist authorities accuse the United States of
improperly helping Solidarity.
   The Solidarity show included tapes of French singer Yves Montand
and American singer Stevie Wonder, both of whom visited Poland in
the past week.
   A major segment was a sketch by Polish comedian Jacek Fedorowicz
on how to choose Solidarity candidates in the complicated voting
procedure for the Sejm, or parliament, and new Senate.
   Fedorowicz is shown at a polling station equipped with glasses
to read the ballot and pens to show viewers how to mark it for
Solidarity candidates.
   Candidates will not be identified by party affiliation on the
ballot and the voter must remember the name of the person he wants
to support.
   To vote for a candidate the voter must cross out the names of
the other candidates.
   The commentator accused Fedorowicz of advising voters to cross
out candidates on the 34-member national list on which top
Communist Party and government officials are running unopposed.
   ``Fedorowicz's call to cross out all candidates from the
national list is a gesture against the agreement,'' the commenator
said. ``It rejects people who created and signed the agreement and
it breaks the rules, so it is better not to mix up a cabaret with
political instructions.''
   An April 5 agreement between Solidarity and the government
established procedures for Poland's first democratic elections
since World War II and allowed Solidarity access to state
television and radio.
   Tuesday's broadcast was the third Solidarity-produced show.
Authorities blocked an election show dealing with human rights that
was to have been shown May 23. They said it violated the April
agreement.

   Mormon Church leaders Tuesday eulogized
two missionaries gunned down last week in Bolivia as martyrs who
were ``two of the best God had to offer.''
   Todd Ray Wilson and Jeffrey Brent Ball, both 20, were killed May
24 as they walked to their apartment in La Paz. Their deaths were
believed to be the first politically motivated slayings of
missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   A group calling itself the Armed Liberation Front of Zarate
Wilka claimed responsibility for the killings. An FBI team was
dispatched to Bolivia to help in the investigation.
   Art Kingdom, aide to Rep. Wayne Owens, said the State Department
informed the Utah Democrat's office about the FBI's involvement and
that the agency said it had no theory about the motivation for the
killings.
   Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson and Thomas S. Monson,
second counselor in the faith's governing First Presidency,
attended a funeral for Ball at the Coalville Stake Center about 40
miles east of Salt Lake City.
   ``Jeff has gone home to God on a missionary transfer. He carries
on his mission; he has not been released,'' Monson told the
gathering of 400 people. ``There is not a missionary parent in this
church whose heart has not grieved and whose eyes have not shed
tears over the passing of these two boys.''
   The frail, 89-year-old Benson, who did not speak, was helped to
his feet and went on to bless Ball's family.
   Following the service, Ball was buried at Coalville Cemetery.
   About 120 miles south of Salt Lake, more than 300 people packed
the Wellington Stake Center for Wilson's funeral.
   Gordon B. Hinckley, first counselor in the First Presidency, and
L. Tom Perry, a member of the faith's Council of the Twelve
Apostles, were keynote speakers.
   Hinckley, referring to the investigation into the slayings, said
while learning the truth is important, it is ``even more important
is that those who were murdered were two of the best God had to
offer.''
   ``As we weep today, the whole church weeps with you,'' Hinckley
said. ``Missionaries are so dear that when one is lost to death,
the entire church grieves.''
   The names of the slain would be ``engraved forever in the
history of the church as those who lived as faithful servants to
the Lord and died as martyrs to His eternal word,'' Hinckley said.
   ``I can't promise the family they will ever recover from the
loss of a son, but your memories of him will be strengthened and
the sweetness of this man's life will bless you in a way you can't
imagine,'' Perry said.
   Wilson was buried at Wellington Cemetery.

   A congressional committee reached a
compromise Tuesday on a new salary law, and labor unions agreed to
call off a nationwide strike set for this week.
   Sen. Ernesto Herrera, chairman of the committee, said the panel
agreed to a $1.19 per day increase in the minimum wage for workers
earning less than $4.76 daily.
   The Senate and House of Representatives are to vote Wednesday on
the proposal and send it to President Corazon Aquino.
   After the committee announcement, the Trade Union Congress of
the Philippines, with about 1.3 million members, and the Labor
Advisory Consultative Council, which represents about 900,000
workers, said they would call off a nationwide strike set for
Thursday.
   Both unions had demanded an increase of $1.42 per day.
   Mrs. Aquino had rejected that demand as inflationary and said it
would discourage foreign investment.
   Avelino Valerio, vice president of the Trade Union Congress,
said the compromise was ``the best we can get.''
   Thousands of workers affiliated with the militant Labor Advisory
Consultative Council went on strike Monday.
   Rep. Alberto Veloso, a member of the congressional panel, said
the compromise was reasonable to achieve labor peace, but employers
were ``cringing in pain about the decision.''
   The Employers Confederation of the Philippines said the increase
was too much. Some companies had said they would cut back on
expansion plans and lay off some workers if the government orders
unacceptable wage boosts.

<HEAD>Zoo Atlanta's Lowland Gorilla Willie B. Meets Girls For First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Willie B., the Atlanta zoo's 30-year-old
silverback lowland gorilla, went on his first date Tuesday and got
slapped for his trouble.
   The male gorilla, who has been isolated from his own kind for 28
years, was introduced to a pair of female gorillas Tuesday morning
in a room specially designed for the assignation.
   Neither Willie B. nor the two females _ 6-year-old Kinyani and
26-year-old Katoomba _ showed any shyness, said Zoo Atlanta
Director Terry Maple. Both females are from Emory University's
Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center.
   ``It couldn't be going any better,'' Maple said. ``So far,
Willie has proved to be very normal in the behaviors he has shown
during the socialization process.''
   The idea behind the meeting wasn't to get the gorillas to mate _
it's much too early for that.
   ``We wouldn't have expected that,'' said zoo spokeswoman Erika
Archibald. ``He has no experience in that.''
   ``This is just a period of socialization for Willie B.,'' she
said. ``We hope that (mating) might happen eventually.''
   A 37-by-20-foot room was prepared for the female gorillas. It
was filled with straw, bamboo and other items such as a large rope
and a tire.
   Kinyani and Katoomba were allowed to decide whether to join
Willie B. in the room by using an overhead door large enough for
them but too small for him. They waltzed right in, Maple said.
   There are two other doors just big enough for Kinyani and
Katoomba to escape if need be, and Maple said both used the doors
several times but always returned to the room.
   Then came a magic moment. Willie B. made contact with a female
gorilla.
   Actually, Katoomba gave Willie B. a little slap and acted a bit
aggressively, said Kenneth Gould, chief of reproductive biology at
Yerkes.
   ``This may be her social experience showing through,'' Gould
said. ``She's been through introductions before and has a history
of being able to look after herself.''

<HEAD>Domestic Partners Law Goes To Mayor After Second OK By Supervisors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law recognizing the unions of homosexuals
and unmarried heterosexuals won unanimous approval from the city
Board of Supervisors, and went to Mayor Art Agnos for his signature.
   Agnos has promised to sign the ordinance, which was approved 9-0
by the board. Two supervisors were absent.
   The law allows unmarried couples, homosexual or heterosexual, to
register as domestic partners for a $35 fee, giving them a
certificate similar to a marriage license.
   The supervisors also voted unanimously for a second time to form
a task force that will examine the possibility of extending city
health benefits to the live-in lovers of city employees.
   Both measures were unanimously approved by the board last week.
   Board President Harry Britt, who sponsored the measures, said
the law will ``let people love as they will.''
   But some religious leaders, including Roman Catholic Archbishop
of San Francisco John Quinn, called the legislation an attack on
the family.
   Last week, gay rights advocates hailed the vote to adopt the
domestic partnership law. They also urged the mayor to consider
extending health benefits to the partners of city employees.
   A few other cities have adopted policies extending health
benefits to live-in lovers of municipal employees. But San
Francisco would be the first to allow any non-married couples in
the country to register their relationships the eay traditional
couples obtain marriage licenses.

   The government plans no further action
in the death of radical student leader Lee Chol-kyu after a major
investigation concluded he died accidentally, a spokesman said
Wednesday.
   The spokesman, who refused to be identified in keeping with
official practice, said prosecutors were satisfied that police were
not involved in the death of Lee, whose body was found May 10 in a
reservoir near Kwangju.
   Dissident groups claimed police tortured and killed Lee. They
mounted protests in the southern city of Kwangju and other cities
demanding that the government admit police were involved.
   They called the government report a coverup, but provided no
evidence backing up their charges of torture.
   About 300 protesters attacked a police station in Kwangju with
iron bars late Tuesday and injured five officers, police said.
About 50 people were hurt in running clashes with riot police in
the area of the government prosecutors' office, they said.
   A government report concluded Lee slipped, fell into the
reservoir and drowned on May 3 after running from a police
roadblock. It said no evidence of torture emerged.
   The report said police stopped Lee at a roadblock and while they
were radioing to police headquarters to check Lee's identity, he
ran away.
   Lee was wanted on charges of violating national security laws
for writing articles praising communist North Korea.

   Two gunmen accompanied by three other
people walked into a high school Tuesday and opened fire outside a
busy cafeteria, wounding a student and a custodian, police said.
   Drugs were suspected in the shooting at East Orange High School,
said Ray Weiss, spokesman for Essex County Prosecutor Herbert Tate
Jr.
   The shootings may have been in retaliation for a fight between
the wounded student and several other students earlier in the day
in the school parking lot, said police Capt. Clarence Brown.
   Custodian George Green, 41, of Orange was in extremely guarded
condition with a bullet wound to the head at University Hospital in
nearby Newark, said hospital spokeswoman Hilda Goldson.
   ``The bullet went in and out of the head and resulted in a
fractured skull,'' Ms. Goldson said.
   The 16-year-old student, who was not identified, was in stable
condition. He was shot twice in the left leg and once in the right
leg, police said.
   Brown said the five suspects, all males ranging in age from 17
to 25, walked into the school cafeteria around noon and began
arguing with the student.
   The group left the cafeteria and entered a hallway, Weiss said.
The five were leaving the building when two of them turned, took
out guns and fired, striking the student and the custodian, he said.
   Brown said he did not know what type of guns were involved.
   There was nothing to indicate that any of the five were
students, Brown said.

<TEXT>
   Premier Turgut Ozal said Tuesday he would
be willing to negotiate an immigration agreement with Bulgaria to
allow the repatriation of ethnic Turks, according to the Anatolia
News Agency.
   ``Our borders are always open,'' Ozal said, responding to a call
Monday from Bulgarian President Todor Zhivkov for Turkey to open
its borders to all ``Bulgarian Moslems.''
   Zhivkov was reacting to growing unrest among ethnic Turks, who
have violently resisted an assimilation campaign in Bulgaria. Since
the campaign began in 1984, 100 ethnic Turks have died in clashes
with Bulgarian security forces and thousands have been imprisoned.
   Ozal said Bulgaria had rejected previous suggestions that the
countries negotiate an immigration agreement, most recently in
1988. He said he believed the announcement from Sophia might be
timed to influence discussion of the issue at a 35-nation Helsinki
human rights conference that opened Tuesday in Paris.
   ``If they have now changed their minds, I propose we immediately
sit at a table and work out an immigration agreement of extensive
scope,'' said Ozal.
   But he said any agreement must protect the rights of ethnic
Turks.
   ``They are sending our ethnic brothers out with only one
suitcase. What happened to their lands, their other goods?'' Ozal
said.
   Although Turkish officials have said they are ready to accept
the entire minority population in Bulgaria if necessary, privately
they are worried about the influx of such a large group without any
possessions, funds or jobs.
   Bulgaria took the offensive at the Paris conference by blaming
Turkey for recent violence involving Bulgaria's ethnic Turks.
   The conference is to review human rights progress among
signatories of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.
   It also is expected to single out nations accused of specific
abuses, and Romania and Bulgaria are expected to take the brunt of
criticism.
   In an early speech, Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov of Bulgaria
accused ``foreign circles'' of being behind recent disturbances in
his country in which ethnic Turks reportedly have been killed.
   The ethnic Turkish minority in Bulgaria is estimated at 900,000.
But Ozal said he believes the figure is as high as 2.5 million.
   Unrest among ethnic Turks has grown recently. Last week, the
Bulgarian news agency said security forces killed three ethnic
Turks protesting the assimilation campaign. But deported ethnic
Turks said upon arriving in Ankara the death toll was at least 30
in the clash.
   The Bulgarian government has resorted to mass deportations of
the minority group to quell mounting resistence to the assimilation
campaign, which changes the Moslem names of ethnic Turks to Slavic
ones, forbids use of the Turkish language and prohibits Islamic
worship.
   An estimated 380,000 Turks have been repatriated to Turkey since
1925 through defection or programs to reunite split families.

   A botched armored truck holdup at a bank
Tuesday ended in a shootout that wounded six people and critically
injured the teen-age gunman, who was shoved through a plate-glass
window, authorities said.
   A guard, five customers and the teen-ager were wounded in the
morning shootout at a Wells Fargo Bank branch, said fire department
Inspector Ed Reed. The 17-year-old boy was the most seriously
injured, Reed said.
   Most of the customers were hurt by glass fragments or shards of
furniture that flew during the shootout, said Sgt. Mike Hulshof. He
said it did not appear that any of the customers' injuries were
life-threatening.
   The guard got out of an armored car in front of the bank about
9:30 a.m. to make a delivery, said police Officer Roger Mora. He
entered the bank and was shot twice, Mora said. The guard and the
teen-ager then traded fire, he said.
   Witnesses told police the teen-ager had been sitting in a chair
apparently waiting for the guard to enter the bank.
   The guard shot the suspect two or three times, hitting him and
causing him to crash back through the glass door and onto the
sidewalk outside, where he fell face down, Mora said.
   Then, the wounded guard ``sat on him until help arrived,'' said
Lt. Bob Ruchhoft.
   The teen-ager and the guard were hospitalized.
   Investigators were searching for two accomplices who reportedly
were waiting in a getaway car, officials said.
   The bank was closed for the day and was scheduled to reopen
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   John Cipollina, a founder of the 1960s
rock band Quicksilver Messenger Service and a guitar star of San
Francisco's ``Summer of Love'' in 1967, has died. He was 45.
   Cippolina, who suffered from emphysema, was rushed to Marin
General Hospital after he became short of breath Monday evening at
his home in Mill Valley, but efforts to save him failed.
   The Berkeley native, whose signature song was the Bo Diddley
classic ``Mona,'' is remembered for his flowing and melodic style
with Quicksilver, which he helped form in 1965.
   The group was never as popular as such San Francisco Bay area
contemporaries as the Grateful Dead or Jefferson Airplane. But
Quicksilver represented the San Francisco sound at its purest,
according to the Encyclopedia of Rock.
   Cipollina lived in El Salvador and Guatemala as a small child,
then moved to Mill Valley in the San Francisco Bay area when he was
6.
   He played guitar as a boy, and by 1964 was performing with folk,
blues and flamenco groups.
   Cippolina left Quicksilver in 1970, and later played with the
band Copperhead and a Welsh band called Man. He toured Europe
during the 1970s.
   Most recently, Cipollina played with the Dinosaurs, a band
composed of former members of Jefferson Airplane, Country Joe and
the Fish, and Big Brother and the Holding Company.
   His mother, who survives him, was a concert pianist and his
godfather was pianist Jose Iturbi. His younger brother, Mario,
plays bass for Huey Lewis and the News.
   Funeral plans were pending.

<TEXT>
   A police chief said Tuesday he ordered
a stadium gate to be opened to prevent soccer fans outside from
being crushed, but minutes later in the surge of the crowd 95
people were killed.
   Superintendent Roger Marshall told an investigating panel he was
told by a senior officer that lives were in danger because of the
mass of people pressing against a gate at the Hillsborough Stadium
before a cup game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on April
15.
   ``There was no real alternative because there was nowhere for
these people to go,'' Marshall said. ``There was no escape route in
any way, shape or form other than into the stadium.''
   As the fans rushed through the open gate they piled into the
crowds in the standing areas in the early minutes of the game.
   Anti-riot fences barred the victims of the crush from escaping
onto the field of the stadium in Sheffield 150 miles north of
London.
   Marshall said when he heard of the casualties, ``I felt this
entire tragedy was my responsibility.''
   Half an hour before the 3 p.m. kickoff there was a carnival
atmosphere outside the stadium, but then as the crowd grew and
became impatient the situation ``deteriorated by the minute in a
big way,'' and the turnstiles had to be closed, he said.
   Marshall said that 15 minues later when he asked the police
control unit for permission to open the gate, ``the situation in
front of the turnstiles was becoming completely and utterly
untenable.
   ``People were crying out and fighting each other. Mounted
officers were working valiantly, but to no avail. They were totally
surrounded by people.''
   ``I have never come across anything like it in my life, and as
time went on we lost our ability to manage that situation,'' he
added. ``The late arrival of fans laced by drink and individuals
who had not got tickets and had an absolute determination to get
into that football (soccer) ground come what may were present that
afternoon.''
   He said that in opening the gate, ``I have to say it never
crossed my mind what the consequences would be.''

   Zinka Milanov, a soprano who sang with the
Metropolitan Opera for 28 years, died Tuesday at age 83.
   Mrs. Milanov, who suffered a stroke Saturday, died at Lenox Hill
Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Anne Warner.
   A native of Zagreb, Yugoslavia, she studied in Zagreb, Milan,
Italy; and Berlin. She made her debut in 1927 at the Zagreb Opera
in Verdi's ``Il Trovatore.''
   After nine years with the Zagreb company, she went to the Vienna
State Opera. Her reputation spread through Europe as she made guest
appearances in Germany, Czechoslovakia and at the Salzburg
Festival, where in 1937 she was chosen by Arturo Toscanini as the
soloist in Verdi's ``Requiem.''
   That same year, she made her U.S. debut at the Metropolitan
Opera as Leonora in ``Il Trovatore.''
   She sang more than 400 performances with the Metropolitan Opera
during her tenure. She was one of the few principal singers to
inaugurate two successive Metropolitan Opera seasons, those of 1951
and 1952.
   She also had a successful concert career and recorded widely in
the Italian repertoire, especially works by Verdi and Puccini.
   She was most noted for the roles of Aida in the Verdi opera of
the same name and Desdemona in Verdi's ``Otello.''
   Born Zinka Kunc, she married twice, to Predag Milanov and L.
Jubomir Ilic.

   The New York Post's publisher confirmed Tuesday
that he had relieved the tabloid's editor of her duties.
   Reports of the change circulated last week.
   In a statement, publisher Peter Kalikow said he was pleased with
the progress the Post had made under Jane Amsterdam in the past
year, but said he wanted someone new to take the paper to another
level.
   Ms. Amsterdam ``has worked hard and intelligently and she leaves
the Post with many achievements,'' Kalikow said. ``She will always
have my respect and high regard.''
   Kalikow spokesman Howard Rubenstein said no specific incident
precipitated the change. ``It's been under consideration for a
while, and Kalikow felt he needed someone new to take the Post to
the next level,'' Rubinstein said.
   It had been reported there was friction between the editor and
publisher over the newspaper's Sunday edition, which has lost
millions since its introduction in March.
   In the statement, Ms. Amsterdam was quoted as saying that she
had had ``a terrific year here and depart with great sadness. The
paper came a long way, achieving new energy and respectability.''
   Ms. Amsterdam, 37, came to the Post 50 weeks ago. She had been
the editor of Manhattan, inc., which she had launched and helped
make a success.
   Rubenstein said Ms. Amsterdam had not finalized her plans for
the future.

   China's leaders intensified efforts to intimidate
the student movement Wednesday but delayed a meeting to purge
government moderates because top officials are locked in a power
struggle sparked by the protests, sources said.
   A military source said the 200,000 troops surrounding Beijing
have been told to ``prepare for winter,'' meaning hardliners are
anticipating a long battle with moderates more sympathetic to the
demonstrations for reform.
   More than a dozen military motorcyles with sidecars and followed
by jeeps raced down the main streets of Beijing on Wednesday, the
latest warning that government tolerance for the protests was
nearing an end.
   State-run Radio Beijing on Wednesday played up divisions in the
student movement. It interviewed Li Lu, a Beijing student leader
who accused non-Beijing students of ``power-grabbing.'' Li said
Beijing students began the protests and students from the provinces
should play a secondary role.
   On Tuesday, workers and students chanted ``Down with police
thuggery!'' outside police headquarters to protest the arrest of
labor leaders sympathetic to their movement for greater freedom and
an end to official corruption.
   The Beijing Daily said that 11 members of motorcycle clubs that
participated in the demonstrations also were jailed.
   Students continued their occupation of Tiananmen Square,
triumphantly unveiling a 33-foot-high sculpture inspired by the
Statue of Liberty in the center of the vast plaza.
   Thousands cheered as the ``Goddess of Democracy'' _ a woman
holding a torch high above her head _ was christened. The statue
faced the portrait of communist China's founder, Mao Tse-tung.
   A core of about 10,000 students have maintained a
round-the-clock protest in the square, but the numbers swelled into
the tens of thousands for the statue's unveiling.
   The official Xinhua News Agency called the statue ``an insult to
the national dignity and image'' and said it should be taken down
by Thursday.
   Indications appeared that the power struggle between hardliners
who oppose political reform and moderates who back some democratic
change had reached an impasse.
   Diplomatic and Chinese sources said a meeting of the Central
Committee of the ruling Communist Party, scheduled to begin in
about 10 days, has been postponed because the leadership is too
divided.
   The meeting was called to ratify a purge of Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang, who last week reportedly was stripped of power.
The Central Committee must approve leadership changes.
   They said the conservative faction, represented by conservative
Premier Li Peng, had yet to gain the necessary support in the
Central Committee to oust Zhao and others sympathetic to the
students.
   Sources said they believed that opposition to the purge was
temporary and that senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who is
masterminding the struggle, would make Zhao step down.
   In another indication Zhao is in danger, the nightly news did
not include his name when mentioning a series of important speeches
being studied by high-ranking party members.
   The other five Politburo members named were mentioned, except
for Hu Qili, a Zhao ally and who also is reported under house
arrest.
   The hardline faction gained another supporter when the Communist
Party committee of the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, issued a statement backing martial law in Beijing.
   Li declared martial law May 20, but troops have been unable,
unwilling or ordered not to move against the protesters who on
occasion have numbered 1 million.
   At the Beijing police headquarters, about 1,000 students and
workers staged a six-hour sit-in demanding information about the
three union leaders who disappeared Monday.
   The Beijing Independent Workers' Union was formed May 19 in
defiance of a government ban on all but the official All China
Federation of Trade Unions. The union, with a claimed membership of
about 3,000, has been active in getting Beijing citizens to
participate in the movement.
   Union head Zhao Pinglu, said one of its leaders, Shen Yinhan, a
27-year-old official with the national airlines, was grabbed by
police Monday in front of the Beijing Hotel.
   Two other union leaders, both employees of the Ministry of
Railways, also were arrested, he said.
   Li Zhihuang, wife of railway employee Qian Yiming, said her
husband's work unit claimed he was arrested by police ``to find out
about the situation at Tiananmen Square.''
   A third man, Bai Dongping, 26, was supposed to take his wife to
the hospital on Monday but didn't show up, said his father, Bai
Baofa. ``The government's actions are vicious,'' he said.
   The official media continued its shrill campaign against the
students participating in the 18-day occupation of the square.
   The People's Daily published a letter from seven intellectuals
recalling the tragic leftist purges of the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution. ``Warn your sons and loved ones not to allow a repeat
of this tragedy of history,'' it said.
   Military sources said all military personnel have been
threatened with court martial if they joined or expressed sympathy
with the movement.

   Central American countries need at least
$350 million to help hundreds of thousands of refugees in the
war-tattered region, according to a three-year plan released
Tuesday at an international conference.
   Delegates from 56 nations and 36 representatives of
international organizations are attending the U.N.-sponsored
Conference on Central American Refugees that opened Monday and ends
Wednesday.
   Mexico, Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and
Costa Rica submitted the three-year plan to be considered. Details
were not released.
   Hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced people, most of
them women and children, have been ``innocent victims of conflicts,
the roots of which lie in the unjust socio-economic structures in
the region,'' said U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
in opening the conference.
   Guatemala President Vinicio Cerezo told a news conference his
government has been able to help Guatemalan refugees who return
voluntarily in small numbers but is not prepared for a repatriation
of thousands.
   He said at least 43,000 Guatemalan refugees are living in Mexico
while some 200,000 refugees, most of them from Nicaragua and El
Salvador, are living in Guatemala.
   ``Their massive return could be grave because we do not have the
physical and economic capacity to solve their problems,'' he said
of the Guatemalan refugees.
   Cerezo said democray in Guatemala would be ``complete when the
Guatemalan refugees have been able to return and live in their
nation, enjoying liberty.''
   Guatemala returned to elected civilian rule three years ago
after years of military control. Cerezo's government has survived
two coup attempts.
   According to the United Nations, 146,000 registered refugees are
in Central America and Mexico, and 893,000 Central Americans are
living illegally throughout the region. About 872,000 people have
been displaced inside their countries. The U.N. figures show 61,500
refugees have been repatriated.
   Representatives of several groups helping refugees held their
news conference Tuesday and complained that their groups had not
been invited to the conference.
   Rolalinda Tuyc, president of the Commission of Those Displaced
by Violence, said her organization had asked Guatemala to allow it
to participate but was told the United Nations had made up the
guest list.
   Oswaldo Enriquez, a member of the Guatemalan Human Rights
Commission in Mexico, said, ``We reject the manipulation by the
government over the problem of refugees and people displaced by
violence.''
   He said the Guatemalan government has not improved conditions
sufficiently to encourage the Guatemalan refugees living in Mexican
camps to return home.
   A delegation of Miskito Indians from Nicaragua made public a
letter they said had been sent to the U.N. Office of High
Commissioner for Refugees asking that the Indians be reclassified
as refugees.
   It said that during the past few years the U.N. agency had
helped Nicaraguan Indians classified as refugees return to their
homeland from camps in Honduras.
   The letter said ``there persists a climate of repression against
us'' in Nicarauga, and this and ``other circumstances motivated the
return to Honduras of the great majority of those who had been
repatriated.''

   U.S. District Judge Thomas J. Curran ruled in
favor of General Electric Co. in two cases while holding stock in
the company, despite a requirement that judges disqualify
themselves in such situations, The Associated Press has learned.
   Curran said he would ``notify counsel of the existence of the
conflicting interest'' and avoid future involvement in cases
involving GE. The U.S. Judicial Code of Ethics forbids a judge from
presiding in a case where he has a financial holding.
   AP discovered the incidents by reviewing Curran's financial
disclosure statements and cross-referencing his stock holdings with
his case files.
   Curran has reported in all his financial disclosure reports
since 1985 that he held between $15,000 and $50,000 in GE stock. He
presided over unrelated cases involving GE Medical Systems in 1987
and 1989 and said in an interview that he was surprised to learn of
the conflicts.

   Federally mandated rules for doling out kidneys
discriminate against blacks, who receive proportionally fewer
organs than whites even though they are four times as likely to
suffer kidney failure, some experts say.
   ``I don't consider it a national tragedy. I consider it
ignorance. As we become more enlightened, then we expect (the
system) to be more fair,'' said Howard University's Dr. Clive O.
Callender, one of the nation's few black transplant surgeons.
   The 1{-year-old rules adopted by the United Network for Organ
Sharing, which administers the national transplant network,
emphasize tissue-matching between kidney donors and recipients.
   Callender and some others contend the rules put blacks at a
disadvantage because a fifth of them have tissue-matching problems
that make them wait longer for kidneys, most of which are donated
by whites.

   Ten U.S. Air Force personnel were hurt
and 22 military vehicles damaged when villagers armed with clubs
and rocks attacked a bombing range to demand the facility be
closed, officials said today.
   Up to 100 villagers stormed the Kooni range south of Seoul late
Monday to demand an end to aircraft bombing practice at the range,
said Sgt. Will Baker, an Air Force spokesman in Seoul.
   Military guards struggled with attackers who scaled fences and
attacked them with clubs and rocks, he said.
   The 10 injured Air Force men were cut or bruised by rocks and
flying glass and a Korean civilian worker was beaten by the
attackers, Air Force officials said. Most of the injuries were
minor and one airman was briefly hospitalized for injuries, they

   The Senate plans to rework a $3.7 billion
domestic spending bill this week, a politically difficult act that
would take center stage except for the leadership struggle among
House Democrats.
   The spending bill took two months for the House to finish and is
under a White House veto threat because of its drug spending
proposals. Work on the measure is likely to provoke disputes over
the federal deficit, fuel House-Senate rivalries and focus
attention on 1990 politics.
   But despite those attention-grabbing elements, most eyes will
doubtless be riveted instead on the travails of House Speaker Jim
Wright. Lawmakers struggling over the bill will find themselves in
the position of vaudevillians following the animal act.
   Wright, D-Texas, is expected by many to step down this week, his
35-year congressional career sunk by ethics allegations over his
personal finances. Jockeying among Democrats hoping to move up on
the party's leadership ladder is already consuming time in the
House.

   Operators of the Seabrook nuclear power
plant warmed the reactor for its first low-power testing, but
opponents planned to turn up some heat of their own with a new
round of mass protests.
   ``The confrontation must come now. It's never been more
important,'' said Paul Gunter, a founder of the Clamshell Alliance
anti-nuclear group and veteran of its first sit-in at Seabrook 13
years ago. ``Thirteen years of opposition have made the issues
crystal clear, and now is really a testing time, both for the plant
and the opposition.''
   Operators began heating the reactor Saturday in preparation for
the first atomic chain reaction, expected within seven to 10 days.
The test will be the biggest milestone yet for a plant that is a
decade behind schedule, billions of dollars over budget and a focus
of the nation's anti-nuclear movement.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Seabrook a low-power
license Friday, the day after a federal appeals court refused to
block the tests.

<HEAD>Newspaper Ads and Computers Replace India's Traditional Matchmakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NILOVA ROY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspaper advertisements and computers
are replacing traditional matchmakers among the literate classes in
India, where brides and grooms rarely choose their own spouses.
   Every Sunday the newspapers are filled with classified ads
inviting inquiries about ``smart, well-educated, professional
boys'' and ``really beautiful, homely, university graduate girls.''
   ``Homely,'' in Indian matrimonial ad English, means someone who
would make a good wife, mother and housekeeper.
   It did not seem odd to Saswati, a 28-year-old executive in a
multinational firm, that her parents inserted a classified ad to
find her a husband.
   ``They asked if I had someone in mind I wanted to marry,''
Saswati said, insisting that her last name not be used. ``When I
said no, they proposed an advertisement in the newspaper. Frankly,
I had no objections. It gave me a wider choice.''
   ``There was a special caste of matchmakers in earlier times,
called `ghataks','' said Arati Srimal, a social scientist. ``They
were welcomed, respected and given pride of place wherever they
visited, because every household had someone eligible for
matrimony.''
   Annu Kurien, a sociologist who found her husband through the
matrimonial columns, said: ``The image of the matchmaker is so
deeply ingrained in the minds of even modern urban Indian youth
that when newspapers replaced the `ghatak' as matchmaker, they
assumed a popularity the `ghatak' could not aspire for.''
   The phenomenon is not confined to Indians in the country.
   Sanjit, a 34-year-old engineer who recently visited New Delhi,
has lived in the United States since he was 12.
   His family received 103 responses when they inserted this ad in
The Times of India: ``Alliance invited for smart, Bengali Hindu
engineer, 34, 185 cms (6 feet), settled in the United States, music
addict, no encumbrances.''
   Sanjit's family narrowed the list to seven and started
negotiations, writing or calling families of the women.
   Sanjit, who also didn't want his last name used, said he hopes
his family will find the right woman so he can get married when he
returns to India in six months.
   ``Parents of Indians abroad seek Indian spouses for their
children in a bid to retain traditional values and roots,'' said
O.P. Sharma, chief of advertisements at The Hindustan Times, a
conservative English-language newspaper famed for carrying the most
matrimonial columns.
   ``The Hindustan Times was the first newspaper in north India to
begin carrying matrimonials in the early 1970s,'' Sharma said. ``We
now run over 4,500 such advertisements a month, and the number is
increasing. Very few advertisements are repeated, an indication
that the success rate is high.''
   The Hindustan Times charges six rupees (37 cents) a word for
matrimonials and gets 48 percent of its classified advertising
revenue from them, Sharma said.
   ``Monthly, this means an income of approximately 1.2 million
rupees ($80,000),'' Sharma said.
   The Hindustan Times also runs a computerized matchmaking service
called ``Life Partners,'' which is offered free to advertisers.
   Names rarely appear in the ads, and most advertisers receive
their answers in special mail boxes at the newspapers.
   An advertising executive at The Times of India, which runs about
2,000 matrimonials a month, said the number of responses varies
from one to hundreds.
   ``Non-resident Indians and green card (U.S. work permit) holders
attract a greater number of people,'' said Narayani Mantoo.
   ``The phenomenon of matrimonial advertisements is predominantly
urban,'' she added. ``More than 95 percent of our clients come from
cities.''
   Cities have the highest concentrations of newspaper readers in a
country where about 43 percent of the 880 million people are
literate. Most of the ads are placed by Hindus, who account for 80
percent of the population, but Sikhs, Christians and Moslems use
them as well.
   A social scientist interpreted the phenomenon of matrimonial
advertisements as a sign that urban Indian society was in
transition but unable to cast off deeply ingrained cultural customs.
   ``The disintegration in the traditional joint family framework
brought around, perforce, a more impersonal, unitary concept of
family,'' said Manisha Bahl at the Center for Women's Development
Studies.
   ``Personal contacts have been replaced by the impersonal
advertisement in a newspaper or agency to bring about the desired
union,'' she said.

<HEAD>Mexico's Labor Unions Struggle Under President Salinas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organized labor is finding itself in a
struggle because of policies laid out by President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari to reverse Mexico's 7-year-old economic crisis.
   Since taking office Dec. 1, Salinas has insisted on economic
austerity and uprooted veteran union bosses synonymous with
corruption.
   ``With the measures that have been taken, the leaders are
cautious,'' said Francisco Zapata, a labor specialist at the
Colegio de Mexico, a graduate school.
   ``The same thing can happen to them that happened to the oil
workers.''
   He was referring to Salinas going after Oil Workers Union leader
Joaquin Hernandez Galicia in January. Hernandez Galicia along with
45 of his associates and union officials wound up in jail on
weapons and other charges.
   More leaders have toppled in Salinas' campaign against the
corruption that impedes economic modernization. The most recent was
Carlos Jonguitud, who had run the National Education Workers' Union
for 17 years but who, unlike Hernandez Galicia, had not opposed
Salinas.
   Jonguitud's ouster met only one of the demands of thousands of
striking teachers. Nearly a month into the strike, which virtually
shut down the nation's public school system, the government
grudgingly offered a 25 percent wage and benefits hike.
   The teachers' victory seemed to indicate that Mexico's workers,
whose paychecks are worth half what they were at the start of the
economic crisis, were starting to awaken and learn to fight for
themselves.
   But when Mexico City bus workers tried the same tactic and
struck for a 50 percent wage increase, the government swiftly fired
all 23,000 of them and canceled their union contract. Salinas made
it clear he wouldn't permit union pay demands to interfere with his
plans to check inflation and streamline the economy. Those plans
include revamping the money-losing city bus system.
   But Salinas faces a delicate situation in trying to retain the
government's longtime control over labor while modernizing the
economy.
   The symbiotic relationship between union leaders and the
government, monopolized by the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
or PRI, has buttressed Mexico's political system and kept the party
in power since 1929.
   Party-aligned union leaders churn out the vote for PRI
candidates and keep workers in line with timely raises and generous
fringe benefits that include housing, recreational facilities and
discount stores. The benefits place PRI-affiliated unionists a cut
above independent workers.
   That system functioned over more than four decades of steady
economic growth. But as Mexico's debt crisis continues and the
economy remains stagnant, Salinas has been forced to keep raises to
a minimum to control inflation.
   Federal funds for such benefits as health and other government
services have dried up, while public investment in a job market
that must accept 1 million new workers each year has virtually
disappeared.
   The PRI suffered the consequences during the presidential
elections last July. Workers didn't turn out the vote in the
traditional massive numbers, and Salinas won with just over 50
percent, the lowest ever for a PRI presidential candidate. Numerous
PRI-affiliated union candidates lost congressional and other races.
   The teachers' strike, possibly the most serious conflict Salinas
has faced since he took office, forced the government to break its
austerity restraints and increase its wage and benefit offer from
10 percent to 25 percent.
   The government also strong-armed the union hierarchy into
first-ever negotiations with dissidents over control of union
locals where dissidents are a majority or are strong.
   The government sought to justify its higher wage offer by saying
that teachers' salaries had fallen behind inflation. But it said
similar raises would not be extended to other unions.
   The one-time concession may work to Salinas' advantage. By
showing flexibility, he provided a means of bringing the estimated
500,000 dissident teachers back into the PRI fold.
   The Mexico City bus workers' union, which is independent,
managed to obtain a court order permitting fired workers to keep
their jobs, at least temporarily, and got the bus system running
again.
   But the government intends to pursue its plan to split up the
public bus company into cooperatives, with workers participating if
they want to.

<TEXT>
   A multimillion dollar plan to sell ``souvenir''
parcels of land near the chateau where the Marquis de Lafayette was
born and left behind to fight in the American Revolution has
infuriated a group seeking to preserve his name.
   ``It's nothing short of a land scam, destined to fool people
into thinking they're buying a piece of history, and they are
not,'' said Christian Malagies, secretary of the Memorial
Lafayette, the foundation that owns Lafayette's birthplace and
operates as a non-profit organization promoting French-American
friendship.
   The venture was launched earlier this year by a private company
with a name similar to the foundation's, L'Immemorial Lafayette.
One of thousands of commercial operations here capitalizing on the
200th anniversary of the French Revolution, it is one of the most
controversial.
   ``The name itself could mislead potential customers who might
think they were contributing to the foundation,'' Malagies said in
a telephone interview.
   L'Immemorial Lafayatte is the brainchild of Caroline
d'Amphernet, a 29-year-old marketing consultant who decided to turn
a 20-year-old dinner party conversation into a money-making concern.
   ``The idea comes from a well-known anecdote about cutting up te
Marquis de Lafayette's embroidered handkerchief and selling the
pieces. The story circulated in Paris for years,'' Ms. d'Amphernet
said in a telephone interview. ``After doing a market study in the
United States on Lafayette, we decided to do something about it.''
   She said the survey indicated that one in 10 Americans knew who
Lafayette was: the general and statesman who fought alongside
American revolutionary forces against the British.
   ``About 50 percent of the people polled had heard of him, but
many thought he was a notorious pirate,'' she said.
   Marquis Gilbert du Mortier de Lafayette (1757-1834) was born in
Chateau Chavaniac Lafayette and spent his youth there. He left for
the United States at 20, served with American forces at Brandywine
and Yorktown and became a close friend of George Washington's.
   In January, the company bought up 25 acres of untilled farmland
near the chateau. Ms. d'Amphernet said she told the farmers why she
wanted the land and why she was ready to pay $900 an acre, more
than three times its normal price.
   Since then, other farmers have expressed interest in selling
additional land in the village, she said.
   ``There is certainly no way we can prove that the land once
belonged to Lafayette since the regional archives were burned in
1860,'' Ms. d'Amphernet said. ``But the history books all agree
that the entire village of Chavaniac Lafayette was part of the
domaine that had belonged to the Lafayette family since medieval
times.''
   L'Immemorial Lafayette plans to divide up the land into pieces
roughly a foot square. Each piece will sell for $100, for a total
of $16.7 million.
   Malagies calls the venture ``too juicy to be honest. ''
   ``The whole operation is completely immoral,'' Malagies said.
``First, there is no evidence to support their claim that the land
belonged to Lafayette. The land is not contiguous to the chateau
but is farther away in the village itself.
   ``Secondly, it's using the bicentennial of the French Revolution
to take advantage of people who are gullible because they're far
away and have never laid eyes on Chateau Chavaniac Lafayette.''
   Ms. d'Amphernet said she has already sold a few pieces in France
but expects to sell the majority to Americans and Japanese. She
plans to contact American cities named for Lafayette along with
historical societies connected to both the American and French
revolutions.
   Each purchase will be accompanied by a hand-painted deed _ a
one-of-a-kind diploma-sized certificate edged in blue, white and
red, decorated with a seal in the form of Lafayette's profile and
bearing the number of the lot and the owner's name.
   ``It'll will be decorative _ the ultimate bicentennial souvenir
for history buffs and francophiles,'' Ms. d'Amphernet said.

   John Sayles, the staunchly independent
filmmaker, would not seem the most likely guy to jump into the
network series grind.
   ``It's part of my program,'' he said. ``I've told myself I'd do
anything once.''
   ``Shannon's Deal'' isn't on NBC's fall schedule, but the
two-hour pilot airs Sunday. Besides Sayles, it boasts such
behind-the-camera talent as ``Jewel of the Nile'' director Lewis
Teague, who also directed Sayles' early feature effort,
``Alligator,'' a cult-favorite horror film; ``Fame'' producer Stan
Rogow; and composer Wynton Marsalis, who wrote the score.
   Sayles, who has avoided big movie studious throughout a film
career that includes ``The Return of the Secaucus Seven,''
``Brother from Another Planet'' and most recently ``Eight Men
Out,'' got involved with the NBC project after Rogow asked if he'd
be interested in writing a TV movie that could become a series.
   ``I said I would if it was something I would be interested in
and maybe write one or two episodes and tell whoever was taking it
over, so long. Kind of establish the character and see if they
could run with it,'' Sayles said as the sound of a jet airplane
almost drowned him out. He talked from a pay phone at JFK
International Airport just before boarding a flight to Italy where
he was to appear in a friend's first feature film.
   Sayles was no stranger to television, having written the TV
movies ``Perfect Match'' and ``Unnatural Causes.'' ``I actually had
a pretty good experience on both of them,'' he said.
   He came up with several series premises, and NBC Entertainment
President Brandon Tartikoff picked ``Shannon's Deal.'' It is from
NBC's own production company, ``so I felt like it wouldn't die of
neglect, because it's one of his babies,'' Sayles said. ``And it
was a nice experience. Everybody seemed to be talking about the
same thing.''
   Indeed, in an apparent effort to keep talent like Sayles coming
back even if he doesn't get on the schedule, NBC is giving the
pilot red-carpet Sunday movie treatment.
   In ``Shannon's Deal,'' set in Philadelphia, Jamey Sheridan plays
Jack Shannon, a former corporate lawyer whose gambling addiction
cost him his family and career. As the movie opens, he's trying to
start over as a general-practice, anything-that-comes-in-the-door
attorney.
   The first case in the door is Lucy Acosta (Elizabeth Pena), who
says her boyfriend was framed and she needs a lawyer. ``The place
is lousy with lawyers. They ought to spray more often,'' says
Shannon, who's sitting on a crate playing poker with himself.
Shannon agrees to represent Lucy's boyfriend if she'll work as his
secretary.
   Shannon's second case _ another young woman looking to spring
her boyfriend from jail _ lands him in the middle of a
drugs-and-money scheme involving CIA agents and Central American
crime bosses.
   Sharing the same floor of the run-down office building is Lou
Gondolph, a shyster who hawks accidental-injury lawsuits in
Spanish-language TV commercials. He's played to great comic effect
by Martin Ferrero, who was informant Izzy Moreno on ``Miami Vice.''
Gondolph says he knows where Shannon is coming from: ``The urge to
hang out your own shingle, be a lone wolf in the treacherous forest
of jurisprudence. I understand completely. Life is not printed on
dollar bills. We are the backbone of the profession. I salute you,
counselor!''
   Sayles said he was ``interested in the guys who do the nuts and
bolts of law,'' the guys who cut back-room deals rather than
grandstand in a courtroom. ``I would be happy, if they make it into
a series, if he never went to court.''
   Sayles made Shannon a former poker sharp so he could use the
skills of bluffing and holding in his dealings with prosecutors,
other attorneys and witnesses. He also liked the idea of having him
confronted daily with the life he gave up.
   ``I was interested in the idea of somebody who is kind of
discovering his value halfway through his life, a guy in his 40s
who's done the gonna-make-a-lotta-money thing, and it's failed for
him, on a lot of levels. He's starting from scratch economically
and emotionally.
   ``I've met people who are recovering alcoholics, drug addicts or
gamble-holics. They have this vulnerable feeling, but at the same
time they can be incredibly tough.''

<HEAD>Pollution Gives Holy Land a Hazy Halo of Smog</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HAIFA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the decades that Israelis were kept busy
building and defending their nation, they had little time for the
environment. The result is the Holy Land today is not blessed with
clean air and water.
   The Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized, today is a muddy
stream devoid of natural life, and sewage is seeping into the
biblical Sea of Galilee.
   In this modern port city, residents are sometimes trapped
indoors by foul-smelling clouds of sulfur dioxide spewed from
refineries and other industrial plants.
   Though some types of pollution are near catastrophic
proportions, most Israelis remain apathetic. Reports of mass fish
poisonings meet with indifference, and Israelis litter their
streets and beaches with soda cans, empty cigarette packs and
plastic bags.
   ``The attitude of most people is that the main purpose is to
build the country and defend it,'' said Uri Merinov, head of the
Environmental Protection Service.
   ``The environment is not a political issue in Israel. There is
no real public movement that demands environmental protection like
in the United States or Europe.''
   Israel does not have such severe problems as acid rain and ocean
dumping that have awakened environmental consciousness elsewhere in
the world.
   It was not until this past December that the government formed
an Environment Ministry to gather under one roof enforcement powers
that had been scattered in 10 different ministries.
   Environment Minister Roni Milo is still fighting with the
agriculture and health ministers over their refusals to surrender
authority.
   In the meantime, polluters continue to dump toxic wastes and
send dangerous fumes into the air.
   One of the worst hit areas is Haifa Bay, site of more than 2,000
industrial plants, including a power plant and oil refineries that
spew sulfur dioxide, a colorless gas blamed for a host of health
problems, including respiratory troubles.
   ``Our old people are suffering from headaches and
breathlessness,'' said Erika Frasch, head nurse at the Iben Ezer
Nursing Home which has 30 patients and is about two miles from
Haifa's industrial area. ``Myself, I feel like I'm poisoned.
There's smoke all over the city.''
   On April 30, the sulfur dioxide content in air increased after a
refinery filter broke down. With a dirty gray cloud hovering over
the city, the elderly and those suffering from respiratory or heart
problems were told to stay indoors. Schools canceled outdoor gym
classes.
   The accident dramatized Haifa's air problems, caused by spotty
compliance with already lax emission standards.
   ``In April, we measured violations on 10 days,'' said Zvi Fuhrer
of the Haifa Town Association for Environmental Protection.
   He noted that the heavy fuel used in Israel's power plants and
refineries contains 3.2 percent sulfur, in contrast to a maximum of
0.5 percent permitted in Los Angeles and 0.3 percent in New York.
   The Environment Ministry wants tougher standards, but the Energy
Ministry, which runs the power plant and the refineries, argues
that using low-sulfur oil and installing scrubbers would make the
plants unprofitable.
   While air pollution is a problem mainly in the industrialized
coastal strip, deteriorating water quality affects nearly all 4.2
million Israelis.
   Water pollution has been causing dysentery outbreaks in Haifa
and the Western Galilee since 1985. In hot weather, health
authorities frequently urge Israelis to boil drinking water.
   In the Sea of Galilee, which provides about 40 percent of
Israel's drinking water, ``there has been a gradual but continuous
deterioration in the quality of the water,'' State Comptroller
Miriam Ben Porat wrote in her 1989 report.
   She noted that in Israel, water is not filtered and carries
sediments that are a fertile breeding ground for germs.
   A major pollutant is sewage that overflows or is pumped backed
into the water system before it has been treated sufficiently, said
Avner Adin, head of the Department of Environmental Sciences at the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
   ``There are no specific regulations on what sewage quality
should be before it goes into a stream or river,'' he said.
   One of the rivers affected is the Jordan.
   Adin, describing its condition as ``not good,'' said both Israel
and Jordan have diverted water for irrigation, lowering the river's
level and raising the salt concentration. Sewage and other
contaminants also seep into the river in the north, he said.
   Merinov blamed Israel's environmental problems mainly on
unchecked industrial development.
   But he said public indifference left over from the ghettos of
Europe and North Africa _ where people had no control over the
environment outside their own homes _ was responsible, too.
   ``One of our major efforts is to change this attitude, but it's
going to be quite difficult,'' Merinov said.

<HEAD>Move Gains Ground for Reparations to Slave Descendants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   For more than 20 years, Detroit real estate broker Raymond
Jenkins has been telling anyone who would listen that the United
States government owes black Americans a debt for centuries of
forced labor by their ancestors.
   For most of that time, Jenkins says, nobody took him very
seriously. ``They thought it was a joke. They said, `The government
will not give the black people of this country anything.'''
   But ever since Congress approved $1.2 billion in reparations to
Japanese-Americans for their treatment during World War II, people
have been listening to Jenkins more and laughing at him less.
   It's too early to call it a movement, but the notion of making
reparations to the descendants of slaves is beginning to catch on
among some prominent black Americans.
   In April, delegates to the African-American Summit in New
Orleans included a call for reparations in their preliminary agenda
of African-American priorities.
   Earlier this year, the Detroit City Council passed a resolution
calling on Congress to set aside $40 billion in reparations to
create an educational fund. In Massachusetts, a state senator
introduced a bill to create a state commission to study the idea.
   And sometime in mid-June, U.S. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., plans
to introduce a bill in Congress that would call for the creation of
a federal commission similar to the one proposed in Massachusetts.
   ``This question is beginning to come up again and again,'' said
James Williams, a spokesman for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, which hasn't taken a position on
reparations.
   The idea probably goes back to the time of emancipation.
   Margaret Washington Creed, a history professor at Cornell
University, said Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman allowed freed
slaves to buy 40-acre plots of land that were abandoned by Southern
planters during his devastating march through Georgia. In most
cases, whites eventually reclaimed the land.
   Sherman's plan led to proposals to give all freed slaves the
opportunity to buy 40 acres of land and a mule, Ms. Creed said. The
proposals were never enacted, but ``40 acres and a mule'' became a
rallying cry for freed slaves and their descendants.
   ``It is almost folklore in black communities across the
country,'' said state Sen. William Owens, the author of the
reparations bill in Massachusetts. Owens said he recalls hearing
the phrase constantly as a child in Alabama.
   The Nation of Islam, also known as the Black Muslims, began
calling on the U.S. government in the 1930s to set aside land for
black Americans, and the notion of land or money for the
descendants of slaves was heard again during the Black Power
movement in the 1960s.
   However, according to Ms. Creed, no proposal for black
reparations has ever advanced to the floor of Congress.
   The latest demands were prompted by last year's passage of the
Japanese-American reparations act, which allotted $20,000 each to
Japanese-Americans who were sent to internment camps during World
War II.
   ``That's when, within the minority community, people started
saying, `Hey, what about us and slavery?''' said John Matlock,
Conyers' district staff director.
   Ed Matovcik, a spokesman for Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif.,
cautioned that the Japanese-American case is unique because ``it is
directly paying those who were wronged.''
   ``That's where this is a different issue,'' he said. ``You're
getting into a whole new ballgame when you start talking about
descendants.''
   Proponents of black reparations respond that the damage done by
slavery is felt by black Americans to this day, and that many
blacks who are alive today were subjected to legally sanctioned
discrimination.
   However, advocates of reparations also acknowledge that it would
be virtually impossible to distribute payments to every descendant
of a slave in the United States. There are approximately 30 million
black Americans, most of whom are descendants of slaves.
   ``Because you're dealing with something that occurred over 100
years ago, you run into problems in determining who's eligible and
who's not,'' Matlock said.
   Consequently, the favored alternative would be to establish
funds to pay for education, housing or medical care.
   ``My idea of reparations,'' said William Strickland, an
instructor of political science in the Afro-American Studies
Program at the University of Massachusetts, ``is that America's
resources need to be put into our cities ... not as any racial
favor but as part of a fundamental strategy to save this country.''
   How much money would be involved? Jenkins has called for $40
billion as a start, although he insisted that it's far from
adequate compensation for 246 years of unpaid labor by millions of
people.
   If Conyers' bill is introduced and passed by Congress, that
would be one of the questions left to the federal commission that
the measure would establish, according to Matlock.
   It's not hard to find people who are skeptical about the
prospects for black reparations. Derrick Bell, a professor at
Harvard Law School, said such payments would be ``just as valid as
the Japanese-American reparations,'' but probably could never be
approved.
   Still, just the growing talk about reparations has been
satisfying for Raymond Jenkins, who believes more than ever that
his goal is possible.
   ``It's catching on. It's been kind of a lonely fight, and I
sometimes wondered why I put all my time into it. ... But now, I
seem to be getting a little results from it.''
   Jenkins, who puts his age at ``over 60,'' said his grandfather,
Will Mobley, was born into slavery.
   ``I can't understand, since our foreparents were in slavery from
1619 to 1865, (why) they didn't even get an apology from our
government,'' he said. ``I just think we haven't been compensated.
... I don't think it's another handout. I think the government owes
us a debt.''

   The five men and one woman have shared the
boarded-up South Bronx brownstone since 1983, their lives devoted
to drugs and crime.
   ``We're closer to each other than to our families,'' says Donna,
a crack addict who is undergoing methadone treatment to help fight
heroin addiction. ``We survive because we take care of each other.''
   Frank, 33, is the group leader. Hooked on heroin when he was 11,
the Bronx native has been in and out of methadone programs since he
was 18. The methadone blocks his appetite for heroin, but smoking
crack, a concentrated cocaine crystal, now satisfies his cravings
for a high.
   Albert, Michael and Fred are crack addicts, too. Kenny has a
heroin habit.
   The commune members have been evicted four times from the
building, which Michael's parents owned until the city seized it
for back taxes. The roof leaks and the ceilings are falling in. The
dank hallway reeks of urine. A rotting staircase leads to the
second-floor living area. A single bulb illuminates a semicircle of
mattresses that are beds by night and sofas by day. Old clothing is
stuffed in plastic bags or piled in corners. Frank's pit bull,
Coco, is kept chained to a radiator, a deterrent to unwanted
visitors.
   There is no heat or running water. The group members take sponge
baths using buckets filled with water taken from a hydrant outside.
A plastic pail is their toilet; it is emptied each morning into a
sewer pipe out on the street.
   Each member is responsible for raising the $1,000 a week it
takes to keep the group's drug habit satisfied. They're willing to
talk about their lives and crimes, they say, because they have
nothing to lose.
   Frank breaks into subway turnstiles and steals tokens. Each
token is worth $1 to a subway rider; newsstand operators and
convenience store owners in the Bronx pay him $75 for 100 tokens.
   ``It's a victimless crime. (We're) not hurting anybody. (We're)
taking back a little of what (we) gave the city,'' he says.
   But his crimes aren't always victimless.
   ``When we ran out of money we've looked at each other and said,
`Let's go hold up a taxi cab driver.' And we did.''
   Frank also deals crack. He pays $5 for a vial that holds less
than a quarter-teaspoon and sells it for $10. Some of his regular
customers include a Long Island gas station owner, a stockbroker, a
Manhattan free-lance artist, a former Amtrak motorman and a Xerox
customer service representative.
   Albert steals copper wire from Metro North commuter railroad
yards and sells it as scrap. He also strips copper wiring and pipes
from abandoned refrigerators and buildings, collects abandoned
mattresses and recycles bundles of unsold newspapers.
   Kenny describes himself as a ``real, real, real good thief.'' He
shoplifts, specializing in videotapes, electronic goods, medicines
and cigarettes. ``I take anything that ain't nailed down.''
   Donna's monthly welfare check goes for crack. ``The day her
welfare check comes in we lay in bed all day getting high,'' says
Frank.
   The group is not unaware of their condition.
   ``We're living like animals,'' Frank says. Since their most
recent eviction, in February, Frank has picked out two abandoned
buildings in the neighborhood in better condition that they can
move into.
   In addition, Donna expects to begin receiving her late husband's
Social Security benefits. He was a heroin addict who died in
December. Their 15-year-old son is in her parents' custody.
   She and Frank have been thinking of using the benefits to rent
an apartment to escape their squalid lifestyle.
   Albert is convinced he can break his crack addiction and
re-enter the mainstream. He has moved into a shelter for homeless
men and says, ``I'll be better in a few months, looking for a job.''
   Frank isn't so hopeful for himself and the others. ``Some of us
are beyond being saved. All of us somewhere in the back of our mind
have a death wish. We just don't have the courage to do it
outright.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With America's streets growing meaner all the
time, more and more women are taking up arms, buying handguns and
learning to use them. Gun manufacturers, noting the trend, have
come out with special weapons for women, and even a little pistol
for joggers that fires right through its wallet-holster.

   Terry Weber, a soft-spoken sharpshooter in
this Midwestern city, sometimes answers the door with a gun on her
hip. On the firing range, she practices her marksmanship against
real-life assailants with wax bullets.
   In New York City, where a woman jogger was attacked and raped by
a roving gang in Central Park, Thalia Adams, 32, practices
regularly at a pistol range. She has twice been the victim of armed
robbery since she moved to Manhattan from Palo Alto, Calif.
   Marie Mann, an insurance executive in Cincinnati, has a
.380-caliber Bersea. She practices with it in her back yard. But
would she use it to shoot an intruder or an attacker? She's not
sure.
   But when a woman takes to shooting, it's usually for reasons of
self-defense, not sport.
   No one knows how many women carry handguns on the streets in the
United States. By some estimates, however, as many as 12 million,
one out of eight, have handguns in their homes.
   There are no reliable statistics. Neither the Justice Department
nor the Treasury's department for alcohol and firearms keeps
records of women who are licensed to carry or own firearms or who
run afoul of the law by their use.
   But firing ranges around the country report a significant
increase in the number of female members in the past four years.
For instance, Lt. John Benner, who started the Tactical Training
Center in Cincinnati, says women once comprised only about 15
percent to 20 percent of his beginning classes. Now they amount to
about 50 percent.
   Sharon Sullivan, a Cincinnati attorney, can knock a clay pigeon
out of the sky on the skeet range at the Moonlight Gun and Hunt
Club, but she doesn't carry her handgun on the street and wonders
about the wisdom of using it in self-defense. Nevertheless, she's
convinced police are no longer sufficient protection.
   Indeed, police all over the country have told citizens that they
have an obligation to maintain order and enforce the laws, but they
cannot defend every citizen's life or safety every minute of every
day. Citizens must take some responsibility. And indeed the courts
have upheld them.
   Some women have taken the warning seriously. They are out there
hefting their .44-caliber Magnums from the West Side Rifle and
Pistol Range in New York City to the Beverly Hills Gun Club in
California. Some even graduate, for sport, to AK-47s and other
automatic weapons.
   Noting the trend, Smith and Wesson has brought out the Lady
Smith, a version of its popular .38-caliber, scaled down to fit a
woman's hand. Another firm, Charter Arms, is offering a his-and-her
pair of .38s called the Bonnie (Parker) and the Clyde (Barrow), the
Bonnie being scaled down in grip and trigger action.
   There are all kinds of new products for the would-be gun-toter,
including a a little gun for joggers. It fires right through its
wallet-holster.
   Polls by women's magazines have shown that women are often the
secret victims of crime, and have bought guns for security. A
Ladies Home Journal poll in 1987 found that 40 percent of 104,000
women queried kept guns at home strictly for protection, and 42
percent said they had been victims of crime.
   Paxton Quigley in her new book, ``Armed &amp; Female,'' a
comprehensive look at women and guns, the law and self-defense,
says chances of being raped at any age in New York are one in
eight; Los Angeles, one in seven; Atlanta, one in five; Detroit,
one in four.
   ``Across our nation, one out of every four families will be
victims of serious crimes like burglary, rape, robbery or murder,''
says Quigley, who estimates that 12 million women have guns in
their homes. ``A Gallup Poll finds that six out of 10 women in this
country are afraid to walk in their own neighborhoods at night.''
   Quigley, a native of California, was once an anti-gun activist.
Then, she says, ``Two things happened in a week's time that changed
my mind. About 2{ years ago a girlfriend of mine heard someone come
in her bathroom window about 1 o'clock in the morning. She called
911, and waited. She didn't know what to do. It happened very
quickly and the damage was done. The police came 10 minutes later.''
   The same week she read a story about a woman who thwarted an
intruder with her own .38-caliber special and held the cringing
would-be attacker at gunpoint until the police arrived.
   ``But she'd stopped a crime from happening while my girlfriend
was raped. Now 2{ years later she's still not well. So I decided it
was time for me to get a gun.''
   Other women coming to the same conclusion have another critical
decision to make. Should they leave the gun at home, or defy the
law by carrying it?
   Gun activists are careful not to encourage women to carry guns.
   If a woman _ or a man _ kills someone who is clearly menacing
her life, chances are they will get off by pleading self-defense, a
woman especially because of the ``disparity of force'' between her
and her attacker.
   But no one can avoid the charge of illegal possession of a
handgun, and in most places could face a year in prison. Bernard
Goetz, New York's subway shooter, is a case in point. He was
acquitted of shooting his young attackers, but jailed for
possession of the instrument of force.

   Sullivan, who practices law in Cincinnati, says, ``Here's the
problem. Once you're close enough to use self-defense, you're
better off submitting. ... In a threatening situation with a gun,
what happens? The attacker gets the gun first. Or you never get a
good drop on him because there are so many variables it's
incredible. Or, if it is a perfect deal and everything works right,
you don't have the justification to use the gun.
   ``The only way I would go jogging in Burnett Park here would be
with a gun. And if I carried it in a holster, the police would stop
me. Or some guy will knock me in the head to get the gun.''
   Terry Weber, who trains people in the use of handguns agrees.
``It's a Catch-22. Do I do my time in prison or take a chance with
my life?''
   Sullivan appealed a case of a young man who was attacked on his
way home through the park early one morning after his wife had
given birth. He killed his assailant and spent a year in prison for
illegal possession of a handgun.
   Linda Farmer, who with her husband J.D. operates the Hard Times
Armory in Atlanta, Ga., says, ``If women are going to be equal to
men in this world, then we are going to have to take on the
responsibility for our own self-defense whether we like it or not,
whether it's something that's feminine or unfeminine, whether you
decide to carry a gun or not.''
   Janet Davis of Kennesaw, Ga., carries a gun in a special pocket
in her purse. There are a number of reasons. Her sister was raped.
She had a job in which she carried a lot of money. The community in
which she lives encouraged every citizen to own a gun, in fact
passed an ordinance requiring it. The local police gave the
National Rifle Association's four-hour course in the use of guns to
anyone who asked.
   Janet, a self-described ``very religious woman,'' went through
all of the arguments for and against the use of lethal force. Her
decision _ to carry a gun, but to exercise caution in its use. ``If
you take it out, you'd better use it, and if you use it, you'd
better empty it.''
   Originally from Nebraska, she and her husband live in the
Atlanta suburb that passed its gun ordinance in reaction to Oak
Grove, Ill., which passed an ordinance prohibiting the ownership of
any guns. She admits her relatives in Nebraska might not understand
her fondness for guns, ``but they still live in Nebraska, and they
don't need to like them.''
   Chief Dwain L. Wilson of the Kennesaw police department says his
officers trained about 500 women in the use of guns, and the
community's small crime rate fell after the ordinance and has
remained at a low level despite the rapid growth of the town.
   But even women who have taken up shooting concede many women are
against it. ``They hate any kind of aggression or any kind of
control or power,'' says Sharon Sullivan. ``They sort of turn up
their little noses.''
   Terry Weber and Paxton Quigley think the training has to go
beyond target practice. Terry takes courses at the Tactical
Training Center which she and her husband, Joe, now own with Lt.
Benner of the Fairfax, Ohio, Police Department.
   ``They are real-life situations with wax bullets.''
   People pop out at you and the student has to make in a split
second shoot or don't-shoot decisions.
   ``They used me in a hostage situation. Somebody had me around
the neck with a gun to my head. What are you going to do? Joe came
on the scene.''
   ``What did he do?''
   ``He shot both of us. You can't believe the ability you lose
when all these things start happening to you. You can be a
tremendous shot on paper, but when those hands start shaking and
the knees start knocking and the adrenalin starts pumping, I've had
people standing as close as 3 feet and miss me.''
   Benner trains women to open their eyes to what is going on
around them, in a series of concentric circles, 15-feet, 30-feet
and farther away.
   Both Wilson and Benner say women make better students than men.
So does longtime gun advocate and shooter Linda Farmer.
   The woman has been taught that firing a gun is going to hurt,
she fears the recoil, but what she is really afraid of is the
noise, Farmer says.
   ``So give her a pair of earmuffs,'' she says. ``She's a better
shot than the man from the beginning. They don't have this macho
thing men have. They can ask questions and nobody faults them for
it.''
   The women who like guns for sport recognize the difficulty of
carrying that over to self-defense. Says Sullivan:
   ``My perception is that women are not very practical when it
comes to their own safety. They'll have a fetish about locking the
doors, but then they'll do all kinds of stupid things like going
out in the middle of the night to get a pack of gum.
   ``I think women will often say they are fearful for their lives,
but they are also fearful of guns. And many will not overcome that
fear to better protect themselves. First of all, the gun is
mechanical and its black and dirty. It's not something that is
appealing to the feminine personality. I think if they had more
pink guns...''
   Terry Weber says, ``That's why women want a smaller-caliber gun.
They only want to shoot him a little bit. So they want a little gun
that's pretty and that will only hurt a little. It doesn't have
stopping power. Yet that's what defensive shooting is all about.''
   Suddenly her voice gets hard and she says, ``Stopping that
person. Psychologically you have to prepare yourself to hurt
somebody.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's as endemic to New Orleans as the Mardi Gras
bacchanal and the strip joints on Bourbon Street. While the
Dixieland jazz funeral fell out of favor for a while, the old
funeral bands are now back on the march, strutting their stuff with
a syncopated send-off for the departed.

   The jazz funeral is making a comeback. For
$1,200, more or less, the Olympia Brass Band will wail you out to
the graveyard, slow and sad, then cut you loose in ragtime and let
``The Saints Go Marching In.''
   The more or less depends on the location of the cemetery.
   ``In New Orleans, the overground vaults are just about full, so
we got to go by van to cemeteries out in the suburbs,'' says Harold
Dejan, who for 30 years has mournfully swayed and strutted with the
word ``leader'' stamped in gold on his black funeral cap. ``But
we'll go anywhere. We just played a funeral in Hattiesburg, Miss.
Young girl called me and said her daddy so wanted to go that way. A
farmer up in Minnesota has got us written into his will. Lots of
folks have.''
   Just turned 80, Dejan is delighted at an upsurge in burial
business from a younger generation that once scorned Dixieland as
``Uncle Tom's tom-tom.''
   ``Everything is lovely,'' he drawls (frequently). ``Funerals are
picking up again. Sometimes we do two, three a week. Black, white,
pink, purple, it makes no difference. We play for anyone who asks.
   ``Years ago, I did three funerals in a day. The lodges and
benevolent societies all had burial policies. Some folks joined
just so's they'd have a band at their funeral. It came with a $50
policy.
   ``We'd march out to the graveyard, then parade the organization
back for $1.50 or $2. The leader got an extra dollar. Now with the
union I'd have to pay my men $40 or $50 for that same funeral, and
the leader gets double.''
   Live business is even better. Besides playing weddings,
baptisms, French Quarter nightclubs, steamboat cruises, Mardi Gras
parades and balls, the old funeral bands are hard pressed to keep
in step with the conventions coming to New Orleans and the fad for
jazz breakfasts and luncheons at hotels and restaurants.
   ``The growth of the hospitality industry makes it tough to get a
band together around here,'' says talent agent Harry Mayronne, who
helps the Olympia with out-of-town bookings.
   The band has made 28 European trips, played for several heads of
state and every president since Lyndon Johnson. It has appeared in
movies like the James Bond film ``Live and Let Die'' and donned
white caps and gloves to welcome Pope John Paul II at the New
Orleans airport.
   ``Jazz, jazz,'' the music-loving pontiff exclaimed as Dejan's
alto sax wailed the counterpoint on ``Lord, Lord, You Sure Been
Good To Me,'' his theme song. Also, he avows, ``the story of my
life.''
   Dejan's father _ ``the biggest drayman in New Orleans'' _ gave
him a clarinet for his 8th birthday, but his love of music came
from his mother, who had heard Jenny Lind and Adelina Patti at the
French opera house.
   When his brother Leo got a gold trumpet _ ``the doctor
recommended it after taking out his tonsils'' _ Dejan wanted a gold
saxophone. ``But Daddy said that would cost twice as much, so I
started work at the Japanese Gardens out in Milenberg the next week
and paid for that sax in three months.''
   In his living room cluttered with trophies, old band hats and
faded snapshots, memories of those dance pavilions and speak-easies
out on Lake Pontchartrain glitter like the diamond in Jelly Roll
Morton's front tooth:
   ``Milneberg Joys'' from a barrelhouse piano. Kid Ory pumping up
a trombone storm over those bootlegger boats bobbing at anchor. Big
Foot Philips on drums. Papa Celestin's horn airborne on ``South
Rampart Street Parade.''
   Dejan was 12 years old when he worked at the Japanese Gardens.
   ``Hey, son, buy you a drink?''
   ``Whiskey, I'd order, and the boss would pour me some cola in a
Japanese teacup and put 50 cents aside. Only made $2 a night, but
the tips were great. They hired me because most of them cats
couldn't read music.''
   Dejan was still in short pants and hid a tuxedo under the porch
to sneak off after dark to the College Inn in Storyville, those
fabled 38 blocks set aside by alderman Sidney Story for sin and
syncopation.
   ``Buy you a drink, baby? Gals say `sure' then dump it into a tin
can under the table. At Mahogany Hall, you took off your shoes.
Didn't dare scratch up that beautiful floor.''
   Dejan's gaze rested on a yellowing photograph of trumpeter
Milton Batiste, his assistant leader, with Louis Armstrong and King
Oliver. ``I call them the three kings. I remember the night Louis
left Tom Anderson's annex on the corner to go with Oliver in
Chicago.''
   Later Sidney Bechet went off to join Josephine Baker's ``Revue
Negre'' and became the toast of Paris. The sweet silver of his
soprano sax echoed in classical fugues by jazz buff Igor
Stravinsky. Bechet's brother Leonard, ``a good dentist and fine
trombonist,'' stayed behind and rendered jazz a singular service.
   Dejan told how trumpet great Bunk Johnson lost his lip and was
reduced to chopping sugar cane, until Leonard ``rejuvenated him
with a new set of choppers.''
   Dixieland evolved from two cultural strains in old New Orleans.
First came ``gens de couleur,'' free people of color, who were the
artisans and shopkeepers in the days of French and Spanish rule.
Military bands were the vogue, and the aristocracy kept Creole
mistresses in maisonettes in the ``Vieux Carre,'' the old quarter,
and showed them off at elegant quadroon balls.

   Refugees from slave uprisings in Haiti and Santo Domingo settled
uptown, above Canal Street, and quickened the musical pulse with
African rhythms and a voodoo beat.
   Jim Crow laws after the Civil War brought an end to Creole
``High Society,'' memorialized in a refrain from a Sousa march, and
forced a fusion of the two musical styles.
   A heritage of French and Spanish names illuminates Dixieland's
discography: Celestin, Bechet, Batiste, Dejan, Alphonse Picou,
Lorenzo Tio, Manuel Perez. ``To this day,'' Mayronne points out,
``almost all the old black musicians in the Quarter are Catholics.''
   This may explain why the jazz funeral, dramatically accelerating
from somber sadness to triumphant gladness, resembles in its rich
rituals the old Latin Requiem Mass.
   ``On the way to the undertakers, you pick up the organization
and play some beautiful gospel songs,'' Dejan explains. ```Bye and
Bye,' `Until That Moment Comes,' `Over in The Gloryland' _ any of
those lovely old dirges.'' (Dejan, like most jazzmen, pronounces it
``dodges.'')
   ``When the body comes out, the band marches ahead of the hearse
and plays nice and soft to the church. `Just A Closer Walk With
Thee.' `Meet Me, Savior.' Sometimes you wait two hours, in the heat
or the cold, for the preacher to get finished.''
   The beat picks up a bit to move the procession toward the
cemetery: ``I'm On My Way.'' ``What a Friend We Have In Jesus.''
``Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.''
   ``We never play the same dodge twice unless the widow requests
it,'' says Dejan. The echoing brass and pounding bass drum draw a
``second line'' of impromptu mourners out of the side streets, off
the stoops, from the bars and cafes. Kids rush from doorways
clutching a bugle or a battered trumpet.
   At the graveside, the ``tempo is real sorrowful.'' Like keeners
at an Irish wake or Jewish elders come to sit shivah, the band is
there to weep.
   ``Amazing Grace.'' Tremulous. Stark. A clarinet cry for pity
piercing the heavens. Saxophone sighing. Tuba and trombone
throbbing, sobbing in counterpoint. Long doomsday drumrolls.
Between wailing solo improvisations, the melody keeps reappearing
like sunlight through the trees. It's as if each bandsman saw his
own name on the coffin plate.
   As Sidney Bechet put it in his autobiography: ``The remembering
and the waiting and the suffering, and looking at that sky,
watching the dark come down _ that's all inside the music.''
   While the gravediggers shovel dirt over the casket, only the
muffled beat of the snare drum leads the mourners out the cemetery
gates.
   ``Then a block or so away,'' Dejan continues, ``you cut that
body loose and jazz it up. `Oh Didn't He Ramble.' `The Saints Go
Marching In.' Like I say, everybody's happy coming back from a
funeral. Especially the widow. She's got the policy.''
   The second line begins to prance and dance through the band,
winging it wild with their own instruments. Grand marshal Anderson
Minor stomps and struts and sways, waving an enormous silk parasol.
   Disrespectful? ``Not at all,'' says Mayronne. ``It's sound
theology. The deceased has gone to glory. Weep no more. Life goes
on.''
   Even the grand marshal, he explains, ``is not a fun figure. He
functions as a blocking back, cutting a path through the jostling
crowd so the trombonist or trumpeter doesn't get a busted lip.''
   Not too long ago, militant blacks complained, sometimes
threateningly, that conventioneers were making a carnival out of
jazz funerals. Dejan disagrees.
   ``The tourists make everything lovely. Sometimes French and
English cats, maybe a Swede, ask if they can join in. I say `Come
on, man.' Now they're playing in the clubs around here. Some even
bought buildings. And those kids you see hustling a horn around the
Quarter, well their daddies were in my band. A new generation is
coming off the streets, out of that second line.''
   Dejan played his most memorable funeral gigs for free.
   ``There's no charge when a musician dies,.'' he says. ``Biggest
I ever saw was for Alphonse Picou. Kid Howard got a fine send-off.
Papa Celestin died in December, some years ago. Lord, it was cold,
cold when we cut him loose on Louisiana Avenue.''
   Two years ago, New Orleans held one of its largest and certainly
most unusual jazz funerals for Allan Jaffe, the young genius behind
Preservation Hall, who often sat in with his tuba among those
perishing old men who make Dixieland a living legend.
   ``No man did more for musicians in this town,'' Dejan says.
``Can't count the times he went with me to the pawnshop to get
somebody's horn out of hock.''
   After a rabbi read the Jewish service at a funeral home on North
Rampart, the Olympia band and four others led a lamenting line of
thousands down the Quarter's streets. When trumpeter Milton Batiste
patted the hearse fondly and ``cut him loose'' with ``Shake It and
Break It,'' the second line writhed and jived, danced and frolicked
and rollicked far into the night.
   ``Everything was lovely,'' Dejan summed up the soulful road to a
journey's end.

   Harold Dejan's dream of playing all those good old gospel songs
like ``Roll, Jordan'' on location in the Holy Land almost turned
into a nightmare.
   The Olympia Brass Band was detained at customs upon arrival from
New Orleans at Israel's Tel Aviv airport in September 1986. They
were suspected of being Black Hebrews, members of a Chicago sect
claiming descent from a biblical tribe, but deemed ineligible for
citizenship by the Israeli government and subject to immediate
deportation.
   Airport security confiscated Milton Batiste's trumpet case and
had it tested by the bomb squad, but missed the only real
contraband the band was carrying.
   ``Wherever they go, they carry along Louisiana pork sausages,''
said booking agent Harry Mayronne.
   During the five hours it took to verify the band's credentials,
leader Dejan handed out ``some purple and gold Mardi Gras
doubloons,'' inscribed with his picture, like the souvenir coins
thrown from the floats in the Mardi Gras parade.
   ``Then everything was lovely,'' Dejan recalls. ``While we waited
to get our passports back, the immigration people let me walk
outside by the fence and pick up some holy rocks from the Holy
Land.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Two engineers, convinced that a Connecticut
inventor beat the Wright brothers into the air by more than two
years, have drawn up blueprints for an engine they believe is
almost identical to the ones that powered that first flight. The
next step, they hope, is to build working replicas of the engines
in an attempt to prove that Gustave Whitehead may have been cheated
out of his proper place in history.

   Speaking with the passion of a television
preacher, Wes Gordeuk got down on his knees and carefully unrolled
a sheaf of documents containing the long-lost secrets of an early
American inventor.
   When he had finished, Gordeuk leaned back and smiled.
   Spread across the carpet on his living room floor were the
blueprints for an engine that Gordeuk believes was used to power
the first airplane flight in the United States.
   ``There's a hell of a lot of detail here,'' he says.
   Gordeuk, an engineer and jet engine instructor at Pratt &amp;
Whitney, and Don Richardson, a former electrical engineering
professor from Stratford, spent more than two years investigating
the engine and drafting the blueprint. They are now putting the
finishing touches on the blueprint and some day hope to build
engines based on the plans.
   The two are part of a team attempting to prove that Gustave
Whitehead made the first powered airplane flight in history on Aug.
14, 1901, more than two years before the Wright brothers flew in
North Carolina. Whitehead allegedly soared 50 feet above the ground
for a distance of about a half-mile at Bridgeport.
   Whitehead apparently did nothing to record his flight for future
historians. There was mention of the flight in a local Bridgeport
newspaper a few days after it reportedly occurred, and the flight
also was mentioned in Scientific American magazine. But there were
no photographs, workbooks, or other ironclad documentation.
   Even the airplane and engines allegedly used didn't survive.
Whitehead enthusiasts say that is because, as a tinkerer, Whitehead
constantly disassembled his inventions and re-used parts for other
work.
   The state of Connecticut in 1964 recognized Whitehead as the
``Father of Connecticut Aviation.'' But claims that Whitehead was
the first in the nation to fly have been rejected by many,
including experts at the Smithsonian Institution.
   The Connecticut Legislature adopted a bill in 1986 asking the
Smithsonian to review the matter, but to no avail.
   Undaunted by the skeptics, the Whitehead Research Society has
been working to quiet the opposition. It is building a flying
replica of the plane Whitehead is believed to have flown 88 years
ago. The plane is known as No. 21, an odd-looking, single-wing
machine modeled after a flying fish.
   Three years ago, the group unveiled a full-scale model of No. 21
that was made of the same materials used by Whitehead _ silk,
bamboo and pine. The replica underwent successful tow tests and
tethered lift tests.
   Gordeuk prepared for the tedious work of reconstructing
blueprints for the engines by making two propellers. The
64-year-old Cromwell resident followed Whitehead's notes and
studied photographs of No. 21, then spent 13 months carving the two
6-foot spruce propellers that were finished in 1985.
   To draft the engine blueprints, Gordeuk and Robinson studied
photographs of the engines and reviewed descriptions by Whitehead's
former co-workers. In addition, they studied engineering handbooks
and hardware catalogs from the turn of the century to help with
their detective work.
   ``Knowing engines, you don't even have to see the whole picture,
because even just a part of a picture to an engineer will give the
whole thing away,'' he says.
   ``We found that the hardware available and used by Gustave
Whitehead in 1901 was exactly the same as it is today. The
standards have not changed.''
   Gordeuk had to go to such extremes because Whitehead left behind
no notes on his work. Some believe that his family discarded the
material many years ago. The scant documentation is one reason
Whitehead's accomplishments have been ignored by history.
   ``We've duplicated, we think, within 99 percent of the actual
engines,'' Gordeuk says. ``By no means was it easy.''
   The two engineers discovered that Whitehead built an external
combustion engine that was modeled after a steam engine. It was
fueled by acetylene gas, which at the turn of the century was
readily available and was considered as the fuel of the future.
Gasoline, at that time, was considered too dangerous a fuel to be
used in engines, Gordeuk says.
   Using acetylene, mixed with air, Whitehead developed a unique,
lightweight engine with tremendous power, Gordeuk says. The
double-acting, four-cylinder engines could produce about 10
horsepower a cylinder. Whitehead used one engine per propeller,
giving him more horsepower than the Wrights had on their first
airplane, Gordeuk says.
   ``He was able to take off after a run of 20 to 25 yards,''
Gordeuk says. ``Why was he able to do this? Simply because he had a
third engine driving the front wheels of the airplane.
   ``The first airplane built that could fly and did fly was able
to take off in any wind conditions or still air in the shortest run
that hasn't been duplicated until recent years. Whitehead was a
genius. He was not a liar.''
   Having developed blueprints for the engines, the Whitehead group
has now reached its next obstacle. Gordeuk said the group is in
need of a machine shop to manufacture the engine parts so that
replica engines can be built. The group has not yet found a machine
shop to help.
   ``We are at somewhat of a dead end now,'' Gordeuk says.
   But he is far from disheartened and he is certain that his
engine and No.21 will fly some day.
   ``We're good engineers,'' he says. ``We know it's going to fly.''
   The Smithsonian ignored the Connecticut Legislature's request
and has no plans to conduct hearings into the matter, says Peter
Jakab, the museum's curator of early aviation.
   ``The governor signed a piece of legislation asking us to
convene a public hearing,'' he says. ``It's just not appropriate
for us to participate in that way. We're not an arbitrative body.''
   The curator says the Wrights fully documented their flight and
research, while the case for Whitehead is based on speculation. As
a result, the development of the blueprints for the engines is
interesting, but not historically significant, he said.
   ``While they claim to have developed the engines,'' he says,
``it's impossible to tell.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With the Kremlin relaxing Stalin-era bans on the
practice of religion, dozens of new Islamic mosques are opening
across Soviet Central Asia, a land awakening from decades of
complacent cronyism. But no one is sure where more religious
freedom and other reforms will lead in this volatile region
separating the heartland of the U.S.S.R. from Iran and Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Central Asia, an arid land
historically at the crossroads of caravans and conquerors, is being
buffeted by resurgent Islam from the Middle East and political
reforms from Moscow.
   With new freedoms under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms, residents of the broad band separating the Soviet Union's
Slavic heartland from Iran and Afghanistan are expressing their
religious, ethnic, and political concerns.
   That represents further progress for Gorbachev, whose program
already has stirred other areas of the Soviet Union. But it also
sets the stage for a possible race between secular communist reform
and revitalized Islam for the future of a land awakening from
decades of complacent cronyism.
   Much depends on the abilities of new civil and religious leaders
to persuade people that more freedom can help solve their problems
and not just offer a vent for their frustration. Such frustration
has sparked bloodshed in other southern Soviet republics _ Armenia,
Azerbaijan and Georgia.
   Success is vital to the Kremlin, faced across its southern
frontier with Iran's Islamic fundamentalism and Afghan rebels who
fought the Soviet Army to a standstill. Both inspire some radicals.
   In an interview after being chosen the new spiritual leader of
Central Asia's Moslems recently, 36-year-old Mohammadsadyk
Mamayusupov indicated he would follow previous religious leaders in
cooperating with the government, but use the reforms broadly to
improve religious life.
   ``We intend to use this moment very judiciously for the
development of our religion and the renewal of its spiritual
life,'' he says.
   Mamayusupov has moved quickly where he can. Between Feb. 6 and
mid-March authorities gave permission for the opening of about 35
new mosques, and he pledged that ``we will continue to open mosques
until all the requests of our Moslems are satisfied.''
   Only about 200 mosques are sprinkled across the five Central
Asian republics: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kirghizia, Turkmenia and
Tadzhikistan, which occupy an area half the size of the continental
United States.
   The number of students in Islamic academies is being doubled and
the number of Korans and other religious books being published will
be greatly increased. The Kremlin is removing a Stalin-era ban on
group religious education and plans to allow believers to organize
charities.
   But radicals predict the increased attention to religious needs
will lead more people to embrace Islamic fundamentalism.
   ``We need to raise the people up,'' said one Moslem radical who
favors establishment of an Iranian-style Islamic republic. ``It
won't be in two, three, or four years. It has to be done very
quietly.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The stakes are considerable. The population of the five Central
Asian republics is booming. From 1970 to 1987, it increased 26
percent to 47.5 million and now makes up about 18 percent of the
Soviet population.
   At the center of much of the region's activity is Uzbekistan and
its capital, Tashkent. The historic cities of Bukhara and Samarkand
along the Silk Route are centers of religious culture.
   What is now Soviet Central Asia accepted Islam in the first
century after Mohammed and was a crossroads for Mongols, Turks,
Persians and Slavs until it was absorbed in Czarist Russia's drive
south in the 19th century.
   Although officially atheist, the Soviet Union nevertheless has
maintained relations with Iran, and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze held a rare meeting with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
last winter.
   The Soviet Union has supported Arab causes in the Middle East
diplomatically and militarily for more than two decades, but now is
trying to improve relations with Israel in order to play a bigger
role in any Middle East peace settlement.
   Mamayusupov, rector of the Higher Islamic Institute in Tashkent,
owes his selection in part to the resurgence of religious feelings.
   In early February, Mufti Shamsuddinkhan Babakhan was ousted by a
series of protests in which radicals accused him of corruption and
lacking sufficient religious knowledge. A council of religious
leaders elected Mamayusupov to replace him.

   Six weeks after ousting Babakhan, believers were demonstrating
again. But this time they were praising God for the return of a
7th-century Koran, a gift from the Uzbekistan government.
   The new openness also has sparked protests of a more political
or ethnic character.
   On April 9, Tashkent sources said, several thousand people
rallied to support Belik, an informal political group seeking to
establish Uzbek as the republic's official language and calling for
drastic measures to improve the environment. Belik means ``unity''
in the Uzbek language.
   In Central Asia, as in the Baltic republics and Armenia, the
deteriorating environment has become a rallying point that has
opened up broader issues such as economic reform and demands for
more local control.
   Gafkha Namatova, a Belik spokeswoman, said the group claims
100,000 members. It supports Gorbachev's reforms, she said, but
``we see a lot that we like'' in the programs of the People's Front
grassroots organizations that have sprung up in the Baltics and
elsewhere.
   National policies demanding cotton production in Central Asia
have led to food shortages, she said. Abuse of farm chemicals on
those same cotton fields has increased infant mortality, she
charged.
   In an interview with the Soviet government newspaper Izvestia in
March, the republic's new president, Mirzaolim Izragimov, said
cotton-growing must be de-emphasized.
   The policy of pushing marginal land into production ruined 1.73
million acres of pasture, he said.
   Drainage of rivers that flow into the Aral Sea, on the border of
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, has lowered the level of the sea and
made it one of the Soviet Union's top environmental concerns.
   Many of the policies and practices now being repudiated in
Central Asia are associated with former President Leonid I.
Brezhnev and his supporters.
   But experience has shown the danger of replacing local
officials, ignoring ethnic feelings.
   In 1986, riots broke out in Alma Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan,
following the replacement of the republic's party leader
Dinmukhamed Kunaev by Gennady Kolbin. Kunaev, an ethnic Kazakh, was
a Politburo member and a close associate of Brezhnev. Kolbin is a
Russian.
   Brezhnev's son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov, was sentenced to 12 years
in a labor camp last December after being convicted of accepting
more than $145,000 from Uzbekistan officials.
   Mamayusupov pledged religious leaders would become more socially
active, fighting bribery, alcoholism and prostitution.
   Attacks on those social ills are not likely to bring him into
conflict with the Kremlin, but Moslem leaders could run into
difficulty with local authorities if they launch a serious
anti-corruption campaign.
   ``Moslems intend to struggle very actively in the social
sphere,'' he said, adding that ecology is the first target.
   While some civil discontent is organized openly through Belik
and similar organizations, the religious discontent remains largely
hidden.
   An underground group calling itself Islam and Democracy claimed
credit for the protests that ousted Babakhan, but it since has
splintered.
   Almaz Yestekov, the 33-year-old chairman, preaches the need for
a strengthening of Islam as well as establishment of Western-style
civil liberties.
   But he said Islam and Democracy ultimately cannot cooperate with
Belik because of the latter's secular views.
   The influence of Khomeini's Iran may be limited. The vast
majority of Soviet Moslems are Sunnis, while Shiites are dominant
in Iran. The two sects have deep historic differences.
   Mamayusupov said the traditions of Soviet Moslems are strong
enough that they will not be carried away by attempts to export a
radical Islamic movement from Iran or Afghanistan.
   ``We have our own view and our own foundation,'' he says. ``We
can influence others, but others cannot influence us.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ On an island on Lake Huron, where once the most
strenuous activity was going fishing and the only industry was a
gravel pit, ``prosperity'' has arrived and an ages-old
confrontation has been renewed. Some islanders, it seems, would
prefer their former peace to prosperity and are in a neck-wringing
mood.

<TEXT>
   The way things have been going
since the arrival of Tom Monaghan, it was no surprise what happened
to his turkeys.
   When Monaghan set up his spread two years ago in a decaying
retreat on this blue-collar fishing island on Lake Huron, he let
the tame farm birds run loose.
   It was just going to be a vacation home, Monaghan said. But in
two years, he apparently changed his mind and what he has done to
the island instead has so angered many of the islanders that one
night somebody wrung those turkeys' necks.
   Monaghan, king of Domino's Pizza, Inc., and entrepreneur
extraordinaire, has converted his Domino's Lodge into a corporate
retreat, built Frank Lloyd Wright copy homes for himself and his
top executives, cleared the woods to make room for an 18-hole golf
course, added a pond and a sewer plant and started building cabins.
   He and his associated landholding companies have bought more
than 1,700 acres of Drummond Island, excluding two auxiliary
islands and other parcels snapped up around the island by land
speculators doing business with Monaghan.
   Monaghan talked of plans for more _ condominiums, marinas,
lodges, banks and golf courses. While he pledged his support for
conservation by stopping his bulldozers from knocking down a tree
with nesting woodpeckers, his workers filled in wetlands.
   Island tempers boiled over. The neck-wringing was one more
unpleasant reminder that some Drummond Islanders would just as soon
see Tom Monaghan pack up his world-class resort plans and take his
jobs elsewhere.
   That doesn't faze Monaghan, an orphan from northern Michigan who
built a pizza empire on a 30-minute delivery guarantee and also
owns the Detroit Tigers baseball team.
   The harbor dredging is on hold and Domino's island bank has been
canned, but Monaghan has kept right on building and buying. Tame
rabbits now wander among the shady cedar groves at Domino's Lodge.
   Unannounced, Monaghan popped in on the back-to-back Drummond
Island Township board and Chamber of Commerce meeting this spring
and told islanders what's what.
   ``For good or bad, things can't go back the way they were,''
Monaghan said. ``Even if we tore Domino's Lodge to the ground and
left, Drummond Island would never be the same...It will prosper
with or without us.''
   Monaghan went on:
   Island residents can jump on board the boom and build their own
motels and restaurants and lodges. Or they can sit by and watch
outsiders do the same, he said.
   ``It's up to the little business to think a little bigger, not
just sit back and complain about everybody else,'' Monaghan said.
   He is right, Drummond Island never will be the same, said
township supervisor, tax assessor and schoolteacher Frank Sasso.
   The change is a shock for the modest island folk who measure
their day around the mainland ferry schedule and whose idea of
progress was marked recently with the erection of Drummond Island's
first four-way stop sign.
   ``Tom doesn't mean harm,'' Sasso said. ``He just sees potential
and we see a place to live.''
   Before Tom Monaghan, Drummond Island was known mostly as a place
for perch, bear and bobcat. The state owns 52 percent of the
9-mile-long island. Its winter population hovers around 700, many
of them summer vacationers who stayed on in retirement.
   Island economy was built on the back of a limestone gravel pit,
but its owners laid off and sold out. Today, Drummond lives mostly
off the spending of the sport fishing trade. Cabin rentals are the
going thing.
   Sasso said he expects the island to be invaded by a new class of
people, the walk-and-shop tourist.
   ``For islanders, it's not what they came here to live for. A lot
of people here work for a lot less money than they can get
elsewhere just so they can live here,'' said Sasso, stabbing the
table with his finger.
   Nobody on Drummond Island is sure how far Monaghan wants to
build or how much more land he wants to acquire. The pizza king
talks loosely of plans to expand the lodge to 40 rooms, build
another lodge and add 40 units around the golf course.

   In other talks, he also has mentioned a commercial motel,
recreation center, miniature golf course, condominiums and another
marina, a mini-car museum, a mail-order trading post and a chapel
retreat with 160 bedrooms.
   A filing by Domino's Lodge Inc. with the Chippewa County
Register of Deeds details a 36-condominium project with the
potential for 236 units. The site plan includes such features as
Pepperoni Pond and Anchovy Alley.
   Domino's community relations director Dick Brunvand said he
doesn't know Monaghan's concrete intentions.
   ``I don't think there are specific plans,'' he said. ``A lot of
the talk is speculative.''
   Domino's continuing quest for island land is an attempt to
preserve a woodland buffer around Monaghan's property, Brunvand
said.
   Monaghan was rebuked once by Michigan's Department of Natural
Resources when he tried to trade non-island land for 1,440 acres of
state forest next to his golf course.
   Domino's Lodge staff and DNR field agents said they expect
Monaghan to try again, this time offering island land.
   The DNR's interest in protecting the Maxton Plains, a rare
bedrock-level plant community on Drummond, is common knowledge,
said DNR agent Pat Hallfrisch in Newberry.
   ``I've heard Mr. Monaghan was purchasing up there,'' Hallfrisch
said. ``My assumption is that when he's got enough, he'll be ready
to trade again.''
   ``It's possible,'' said Joe Viilo, an islander who works for
Monaghan as head of operations at Domino's Lodge.
   No longer a personal retreat, Domino's Lodge is a full-scale
business venture that not even Domino's can afford to keep empty,
Brunvand said.
   Domino's now is trying to market the island getaway to other
corporations, he said.
   ``We're losing money at a rapid pace,'' Brunvand said. ``You
have to understand the Domino's organization...The point is, we
will not continue to lose money here.''
   Chamber of Commerce president Charles Krahnke protests the
notion that Monaghan has changed Drummond Island to Domino's
Island. ``Other than the construction activity and an increase in
airplane traffic at the township airport, little has changed,'' he
wrote in an open letter to the media.
   Krahnke's life has changed, however. He owns a small fishing
resort across the bay from Domino's Lodge. In August, Krahnke sold
the neighboring James Island to one of Domino's landholding
companies.
   Shoreline property prices are up sharply and land sales are hot,
island real estate broker Theila Gagliardi said. ``Last year, I had
the best year of my business in 14 years on the island,'' she said.
   Bob Conard came to Drummond Island to escape. A one-time college
activist and current caretaker and odd-jobs man, he and his wife
live in a house without electricity on the opposite side of the
island from Domino's. They watch bluebirds nesting in the field
nearby.
   When he heard Monaghan wanted to dredge the island's main
fishing harbor, Potagannissing Bay, so a schooner called the Domino
Effect could park there, an angry Conard began the Drummond Beacon
Journal on his dining room table.
   The birth of that island newspaper spawned another publication:
the Drummond Island Digest, edited by Brunvand from Domino's
corporate headquarters in Ann Arbor and printed on parchment stock.
   Readers are treated to a polarity of opinion.
   ``Regardless of where they came from, the people who settled
this fair island came here to assert their independence, harvest
the bounty of the woods and waters, enjoy the fresh air, peace and
quiet of `God's Country,' and work together to build a better
future for themselves and their children,'' Brunvand wrote in a
recent editorial. ``That's why Tom Monaghan and the Domino's Family
are here, to share this heritage and preserve it.''
   In a letter to the Beacon Journal, summer visitor Joan Meyer of
Grand Rapids expressed different sentiment.
   ``I shall miss my Drummond Island,'' she said. ``It will never
be the same.''

industrialized nations in the amount of trash it recycles, about 10
percent, but that is changing as the nation's garbage dumps fill
up. Indeed, some entrepreneurs are cashing in on a recycling boom,
applying modern business methods and computer technology to the old
scrap business.

   Paul Meyer, an 81-year-old former corrections
office and bank guard who drives a dented pickup truck, collects
hundreds of pounds of newspapers a day for recycling. He gives the
proceeds to charity.
   Like a growing number of others, Meyer has found there's money
to be made in trash. He figures he's given more than $60,000 to
various Masons' organizations since 1977, in particular the
Scottish Rite Foundation for Aphasic Children, which he helped
establish.
   Meyer takes his newspapers to Tri-R Systems, a recycling company
in northeast Denver, which like many other companies is cashing in
on the recycling boom.
   Meyer's stack of newspapers is immediately added to the
inventory by laptop computer.
   ``We've essentially applied fast-food techniques to the old
scrap business,'' says Tri-R president David Powelson.
   The scrap and recycling industry is approaching the $14 billion
mark in annual sales, Powelson says. He said Tri-R had $1.5 million
in sales in 1983 and $5.3 million in sales last year.
   Founded in 1977, it now accepts 35 kinds of recyclable
materials, from paper to plastic and brass to glass, at operations
in three states.
   The growth of recycling has ``changed the economies of scale''
in the scrap industry, attracting entrepreneurs versed in
business-school economics and computer technology, Powelson says.
   Bob Rubin agrees. He's director of Recycle Now, a non-profit
group funded largely by the beverage and container industries to
encourage the growth of recycling in Colorado.
   ``There's a definite trend toward multimaterial recycling
facilities with an emphasis on being as convenient as possible,''
he says. ``Recycling works best when it's most convenient.''
   Although America still has one of the lowest recycling rates of
industrialized nations _ about 10 percent _ that rate has begun to
climb in the last few years and is expected to accelerate in the
next decade.
   The nation's garbage dumps are filling up rapidly, and public
awareness of the problem has grown to what Powelson calls
``staggering'' proportions.
   Studies say as much as 86 percent of household trash could be
recycled, and the Environmental Protection Agency has set a goal of
recycling 25 percent within four years.
   Smaller scrap and recycling companies also are benefiting from
the industry boom.
   Leonard Benson, of Benson and Benson Iron and Metal Co., says
his company is expanding, moving from its scrap yard in Denver to a
``customer-service center'' in suburban Westminster equipped with
can-buying machines and attendants to help customers unload their
recyclables.
   Benson, whose father was in the scrap business, says he didn't
decide to enter the business until five years ago.
   ``Recycling has put a lot of people into business,'' he says,
adding that scrap dealers ``are getting away from the old scrap
salvage yard.''
   ``We're now dealing with residential businesses and people in
the community _ providing a community service by making recycling
efficient to more customers.''
   For manufacturers, using recyclables can be cheaper than finding
and processing raw materials. Using recycled paper products instead
of virgin products, for example, can cut the energy used in
production by as much as 74 percent, according to the Washington,
D.C.-based Worldwatch Institute. It also cuts water usage by more
than half, and air and water pollution significantly.
   Tri-R has more than 1,000 commercial accounts to which it sends
trucks to pick up recyclables. It also collects recyclables from
people who come to its several distribution centers in Colorado,
Wyoming and Arizona, or to the dozen or so ``Money Mobile''
truck-trailers that the company franchises out and parks on busy
streets in residential neighborhoods.
   Tri-R turns around and sells the recyclables to companies like
Container Corporation of America, Weyerhaeuser, Reynolds Aluminum
and others, including brokers who sell the recyclables to mills in
several Asian countries.
   Old computer paper that Tri-R picks up at a corporate customer's
offices, for instance, is put on conveyor belts in Tri-R's
warehouse and run through a shredder and baler.
   The shredded spread sheets are bought by tissue-paper
manufacturers, Powelson says.
   The company's main warehouse in Denver processes 4 million to 5
million pounds of recyclable materials daily, most of which is sold
the very same day to keep inventory low.
   Computerization of the inventory means Tri-R also can adjust the
prices it pays for materials to fit the latest market conditions,
Powelson says.
   Powelson says the recyclers' real competition is the trash can,
and he is hopeful ``the world's No. 1 throw-away society'' will
keep changing its ways.
   Standing amid mountains of baled paper and cans in Tri-R's
warehouse, he winces at the words ``trash'' or ``garbage.''
   ``I just look at them and see money,'' he says.
   So does Meyer. One load of newspapers in his truck weighs from
2,200 to 2,800 pounds, for which he is paid 1{ cents a pound.
   When asked how much he makes in this business, Meyer consults a
battered notebook he keeps in his shirt pocket. In the last 2{
months, he brought in about 40 tons of paper for $1,750.75.

   Cindy Williams and Bill Hudson, stars of the
Disney Channel's ``Just Like Family,'' are indeed just like family.
   Not only are the two married in real life, and the parents of
two children, but one daughter has made an appearance on the new
comedy series.
   Williams and Hudson play a childless couple that hires two
children to pose as their offspring. That's to satisfy the whims of
Hudson's new boss, who runs a children's clothing company and drops
hints about Hudson being a ``family man.''
   The weekly half-hour comedy series, taped before an audience,
made its debut in mid-May.
   One of the children in ``Just Like Family'' is named Emily,
after their 6-year-old daughter.
   ``The real Emily was in a birthday party scene recently,'' says
Williams, who is best known for her role as Shirley Feeney on the
hit comedy series ``Laverne and Shirley.'' ``She was a tad confused
when we called the actress Emily.''
   ``She'd told us one day, `Why can't I be on the show?''' Hudson
says. ``The next week was the birthday party and we talked to the
producers. She was an extra with no lines. Afterward, when we took
her home, she said, `Next time I want lines.'''
   Both parents say they like the family feeling of working at the
Disney Studio.
   ``It's like being in high school,'' says Hudson, who began his
career as a member of the musical group The Hudson Brothers. ``The
studio's like a campus. It's a real family atmosphere.''
   Williams quit ``Laverne and Shirley'' in 1982 when she became
pregnant. The series, which also starred Penny Marshall as Laverne
De Fazio, lasted for another season. The show, a spinoff of ``Happy
Days,'' made its debut in January 1976 in first place in the
ratings. It finished the season in third place and the next season
it was second to ``Happy Days.'' It was first for two seasons,
1977-78 and 1978-79.
   Since then, Williams has been looking for another series and
working mostly at Disney.
   Williams had starred in ``Save the Dog'' for the Disney Channel
and did two Disney Sunday Movies, ``The Leftovers,'' with John
Denver, and ``Help Wanted: Kids,'' with Hudson. The latter inspired
the current series.
   ``They didn't have any actors for the movie on a Friday and it
was due to start filming on Monday,'' she says. ``Jeffrey
Katzenberg (president of Walt Disney Studios) called and asked if
Bill and I would do it. The movie did very well in the ratings.''
   Williams turned down initial overtures from the studio to make
it into a series.
   ``I didn't want to do a show about parents and kids,'' she says.
``I felt the market was saturated. I wanted to do an ensemble show.
That didn't happen, so I said let's do this one.''
   In the series, they play a young couple that moves from New York
to Nevada when the husband (Hudson as Tom Burke) accepts a new job
with a children's clothing company. Williams is Lisa Burke, a
big-city newspaper woman who finds her only outlet is a small
weekly newspaper. Gabriel Damon, 13, and Grace Johnston, 8, also
star as their ``rented'' children.
   Pat McCormick appears as the head of Giddyup Clothes and Dan
Hedaya is the seedy Uncle Lucky.
   ``The way we explore the rented aspect is that both the adults
and the children need something from each other,'' Hudson says.
``We need them for the job and they need us because they're little
scam artists. They live with Uncle Lucky, who's always got some
scheme going.
   ``The important thing is that a bond grows between the couple
and the children. Especially with Cindy, whose maternal instincts
come out.''
   But, Williams adds, ``Basically, it's a comedy.''
   ``Cindy's theory is that we have 22 minutes, so make them
laugh,'' Hudson says. I go for the subtext, the underlying meaning.
Cindy goes for the laughs.''
   Prior to the movie and series, Williams and Hudson had only
appeared together in the play ``See How They Run'' at the Burt
Reynolds Theater in Jupiter, Fla.

   Ira Levin, a novelist and playwright whose
thrillers and mysteries have spiced the stage and bookstores for
years, notes wistfully that ``comedy comes easiest.''
   But book editors ask for thrillers, not comedies, Levin says.
   ``I always have to watch myself,'' he says. Very often when I'm
writing scary stuff, I find I can't resist a little joke. I
eventually edit it out. Sometimes I'll write a good one down and
hope a place will show up for it. It rarely does. A joke usually
springs out of the situation and characters.''
   His current off-Broadway offering is ``Cantorial,'' in which the
audience never sees the cantor. They only hear him singing, a
singing ghost.
   Not a new twist for Levin, who has written about the
supernatural before. But unlike his best-known novel, ``Rosemary's
Baby,'' this play's ghost is benign. All he does is sing. But his
songs are directed to a young couple that has taken up residence in
a former Manhattan synagogue. The ghostly voice wants their
furniture out of the living room. He wants it to be a synagogue
again.
   Levin's other novels include ``A Kiss Before Dying,'' ``The
Stepford Wives'' and ``The Boys from Brazil.'' His plays range from
the comedy ``No Time for Sergeants'' in 1955 to ``Deathtrap'' in
1978, Broadway's longest-running thriller.
   ``For a while I would go back and forth between a play and a
book,'' Levin says. ``At this point, I'd like to do more books.
It's hard to get a play on. It takes so long. It was easier in the
old days.''
   ``Cantorial'' was presented three years ago in Stamford, Conn.
``There were problems with it,'' Levin says. ``I put it on the
shelf. Then I did a complete rewrite. I felt I had found the
problems with it so it was kind of exciting to get it right.''
   He doesn't mind that it's being presented off-Broadway instead
of on and is pleased at its success there. ``We're hoping it's
going to have a good, long, healthy run. So far it is doing very
nicely. The audience seems to be building, from word-of-mouth.''
   Levin doesn't want potential playgoers to think ``Cantorial,''
with the young man in it adopted and thinking he may be Jewish, is
only for Jews. ``I think non-Jewish people seem to respond to it,
if anything, more warmly than Jewish audience members. Partly, I
think they're relieved they've enjoyed it.
   ``I always intended it for a mainstream audience. We all are
looking for roots and family warmth, even those of us who've had
it. It's nice to have that sense of recapturing it.''
   Levin plunged into writing full time after New York University,
where he majored in English. A TV script he wrote for a competition
was bought by NBC.
   ``That was enough to encourage my parents to let me stay home
and write,'' he says. ``I wrote a few more TV plays that sold. I
wrote a few that didn't. I wrote my first book, `A Kiss Before
Dying,' then I went out looking for work. Before I could find a job
the book had been accepted by Simon and Schuster, so I officially
became a writer. I've never held an honest job.
   ``That's unless you count two years in the Army. Even there I
managed to write training films.''
   Levin, who is divorced and has three grown sons, lives in a
Manhattan apartment with a grand piano and a big, black coffee
table with a big black box in the center. It's a TV projector for a
10-foot screen which pulls down from the ceiling. Consequently he
doesn't read much anymore.
   ``The architect who did the apartment talked me into it. I've
got my own movie theater, which I always wanted as a child. I've
really gotten hooked on TV. It has even made a baseball fan of me,
which I never was.'' The study where he writes is partitioned from
the living room by a wall of glass bricks.
   ``I tend to be a workaholic,'' he says. ``When I really get into
something, I wake up earlier and earlier and work later and later.
After a few days I can't tell the fictional world from the real
world.''
   Years ago, Levin made a list of interesting settings for novels
or plays. A haunted synagogue was on the list.
   ``One day it dawned on me it should be haunted by a cantor, not
somebody banging around in chains,'' he says. ``I thought cantorial
singing would be interesting; it's unusual to hear in a theater.
That's how I got started. Then the synagogue became a former
synagogue. The singing obviously made it a play instead of a
novel.''
   ```The Boys from Brazil' was always a novel idea because these
boys would have to be cropping up in different countries.''
   Levin never has written a screenplay. ``Any idea I got could be
a play or a novel first,'' he says. ``I might as well do it that
way and please myself rather than write a screenplay that has to
please 100 people on the coast.
   ``I was going to do `Deathtrap,' then the thought of writing the
whole thing over again got to be a chore. I was sorry afterward. I
wasn't that happy with the screenplay that was done.''
   But he liked ``Rosemary's Baby.''
   ``It's probably the most faithful movie adaptation that has ever
been made,'' he says. ``Roman Polanski directed it and wrote the
screenplay. It was the first movie he'd made that wasn't based on
his own original material. I don't think he knew he had a right to
change things.''

<HEAD>CONTINENT IN CRISIS _ Future Dim for South America's Young</HEAD>

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   As South America sinks lower into economic
morass, its young people see their futures sinking with it. Many
are not staying around, leaving the continent with the prospect of
a serious loss of brain power in the years ahead. This is one of a
series of periodic reports by The Associated Press on the economic,
social and political turbulence that has turned South America into
a continent in crisis.

<TEXT>
   South America's young are losing
faith in their debt-ridden continent's future. They are emigrating
in ever-growing numbers to escape deepening economic and social
crises in their homelands.
   Angry with widespread nepotism, patronage and corruption in
their governments and frustrated by shrinking job markets, more and
more youngsters are lining up outside emigration offices for visas,
hoping to pursue careers in the United States or Europe.
   In Rio de Janeiro alone, on every business day, visa lines of
about 200 people form outside the U.S. Consulate. Most in the lines
are young.
   Similar lines are seen in such capitals as Buenos Aires in
Argentina and Montevideo in Uruguay.
   Young people, youth leaders and professional counselors
contacted by The Associated Press in eight South American nations
said 16 to 21-year-olds doubt a ready solution exists to the
continent's inflation, joblessness, indebtedness and economic
stagnation.
   ``It's like inheriting a nightmare,'' said Luciana Jorge da
Silva, 16, a high school sophomore and a youth leader in Santos,
Brazil. ``You don't know exactly when it began or how to end it.''
   Widespread anxiety has replaced a mood of optimism born 10 years
ago when a number of South American countries began a passage from
dictatorship to civilian rule.
   Since then, the region's youth have seen civilian authority
erode from within by corruption, inefficiency and government
indecision and challenged from without by disgruntled military
officers, drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas.
   Newly restored press freedoms have exposed violence,
environmental abuse and social injustice often hidden during
military rule, forcing the young to view their countries in a new,
painfully realistic manner.
   ``We are victims of a lost decade,'' said Marcelo Rodrigues de
Carvalho, 21, a university biology student in Rio de Janeiro. ``Our
economies are in ruins, we are financially exploited by the U.S.
and Europe, and we have lost our cultural identity.''
   Runaway inflation, shrinking buying power and spiraling
unemployment add to the gloom.
   University students often abandon school to become maids, street
peddlers, movie ushers or black marketeers.
   Raul, 18, is one of some 3,000 money changers on the streets of
Lima, the capital of Peru.
   ``I change dollars now because it's the only way for me to make
decent money,'' he said. ``Besides, I'm not strong enough to carry
heavy loads and I'd rather do this than steal.''
   In Venezuela or Chile, two of South America's more economically
stable nations, there is a vague awareness among young people that
things are getting worse.
   ``Finding a job will be more difficult than graduating,'' said
Carlos Garofalo, 18, a college freshman in Caracas, Venezuela,
studying electrical engineering.
   In some countries, desperation turns to violence.
   In Colombia and Peru, where leftist insurgenices have grown, the
nations' young play a key role in armed struggle against government
forces. In Peru, the average age of a guerrilla fighter in the
Marxist Shining Path group is 16 to 20.
   Unemployment and deficient educational systems have likewise
triggered a steep rise in drug and alcohol abuse among youth across
the continent, especially in slums around large metropolitan
centers.
   A recent survey of high school students in Montevideo, Uruguay's
capital, found that 11 percent of 13-to-17-year-olds were drug or
alcohol addicts. In 1987, more than 44 percent of Peruvians 19 to
24 consumed cocaine paste, according to police figures.
   In Rio de Janeiro, slum dwellers are often organized and ruled
by young narcotics kings who train children as young as 12 to use
guns and run cocaine to customers in wealthy suburbs.
   In Santiago, Chile, where various social research organizations
estimate that more than 500,000 young people in the metropolitan
area of 4 million are underemployed or unemployed. Drug abuse is
rampant there too.
   Juan Reyes, 19, who works as a doorman at the garage of a major
Santiago bank, said, ``In the ghetto where I live, there were two
kids who used drugs a few years ago. Now, there are dozens who do
it. And many others drink. It's because they have nothing to do but
hang around.''
   The economic squeeze has made a college education impossible for
all but the elite. In Chile, where the minimum legal salary of
about 38 percent of the population is the equivalent of $72 a
month, state-owned universities charge $120 a month tuition.
   In Brazil, where only 35 percent make more than the minimum wage
of $85 monthly, an average college tuition upwards of $130 a month
is far out of reach.
   Allessandra de Oliveira Nobre, 17, dropped out of a Rio
institute that trained flight stewardesses to take a job in a
McDonald's for $20 a month.
   ``My life seems like it's over and I haven't even had a chance
at a career,'' she said.
   Still, most student and vocational couselors regard a college
diploma as little more than a piece of paper.
   ``Young people go to college knowing they'll get a degree, but
not a job,'' said Sen. Enrique Bernales of Peru.
   ``What does education in Argentina do for young people?'' said
Roman Ojeda, 20, a pre-law student at the University of Buenos
Aires. ``It gives them the opportunity to leave Argentina.''
   Indeed, escape seems the only way out.
   In Buenos Aires, long lines snake around blocks outside the
Italian and Spanish embassies, where work papers can be obtained
easily for children and grandchildren of Italians and Spaniards.
   In Montevideo, one survey indicated that a third of people 15 to
29 years old hope to leave Uruguay to find a better job in Spain,
Argentina or the United States.
   At the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, the young apply for
student visas or work permits.
   Yet while history shows that South American teen-agers often
look to the armed forces to provide leadership in times of crisis,
this is not happening today, at least in part because of growing
awareness that the continent's social crisis and foreign debt were
left behind by preceding miltiary regimes.
   As a result, most guidance counselors and vocational experts
say, the brain drain will deprive South America of talent needed
for economic development.
   Young people, though aware of economic strains imposed by South
America's $277.4 billion foreign debt, overwhelmingly blame corrupt
government officials for their nations' problems.
   ``Everybody knows they're all thieves,'' said Maye Villarroel,
15, a high school student in Caracas, reflecting what seems to be a
general sentiment among youths.
   More alarming to some, such as Brazilian career counselor Paulo
Quintanilha Nobre de Mello, the continent's economic decay seems
directly and indirectly linked to a ``savage individualism'' and
moral decadence.
   ``Everybody is responsible for the current situation,'' says
Daniel Lin, 17, a high school student in Buenos Aires. ``But
absolutely nobody takes responsibility.''

   As the U.S. Supreme Court considers a new ruling on
legal abortion, the issue is flaring in Western Europe with
church-backed groups fighting to limit laws that have made the
practice widely available.
   The issue has touched off street demonstrations in Italy,
threatened the stability of Belgium's government and prompted a
debate in West Germany, where authorities have cracked down on
violators of the abortion law.
   But in many other parts of the world, it is barely an issue at
all, either because of a consensus it is wrong or a broad
acceptance of abortion as a form of birth control.
   In the Soviet bloc and China, for example, abortion has reached
very high levels _ one for every two live births in China _ but it
is widely accepted as a means to prevent unwanted babies. Even in
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Poland, the practice is widespread.
   The Catholic Church has been the principal force behind
worldwide campaigning against abortion.
   ``The protection and defense of the human person _ every person
and the whole person, especially those who are vulnerable and most
helpless: this is a task which the Catholic Church, in the name of
Christ, cannot and will not forsake,'' Pope John Paul II said May
23, reaffirming the church's total ban on abortion.
   In the United States, church-backed groups have played a key
role in a vocal campaign against the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
that made abortion a constitutional right. The Supreme Court in
Wasshington is reconsidering that decision and is expected to rule
by late June.
   Abortion became legal in many Western European countries in the
1970s and early 1980s. But, as in the United States, legalization
has not tempered the debate.
   In Italy, hundreds of thousands of protesters thronged the
streets of Rome this spring in the biggest demonstrations for and
against abortion since 1981, when Italians voted in a referendum to
uphold the practice on demand in the first three months of
pregnancy.
   Health Minister Carlo Donat Cattin, a member of the Christian
Democrat Party, has joined religious groups and conservatives in
calling for limits on the 1978 law. Pro-abortion demonstrators have
countered, protesting ``loopholes'' in the law they blame for a
growing number of ``back alley'' abortions.
   In Belgium, a 16-year battle to legalize abortion realized its
first victory in May when two Senate committees voted to allow
abortion in cases of psychological or economic ``distress.''
   But the measure is fiercely opposed by Belgium's dominant
Christian Democrats, a Catholic-inspired party. The issue could
bring down the coalition government.
   In Western Europe, as in the United States, restrictions on
abortion have not prevented women from getting them elsewhere.
   For example, many Belgians go next door to the Netherlands,
where abortion laws are more liberal. Dutch hospitals performed
36,455 abortions in 1986, 21,655 of them for foreigners.
   And in Britain, doctors performed 3,673 abortions in 1987 for
women from Ireland, where the operation is illegal.
   The abortion issue returned to the front pages in West Germany
in May, when a Bavarian court convicted Dr. Horst Theissen of
performing abortions without proof that the women had been
counseled by at least two doctors, as required by law.
   Bavaria state, which is 70 percent Catholic, also indicted 156
of Theissen's patients on charges of getting abortions without the
required counseling. Most were fined. The cases prompted rallies by
pro-abortion groups and criticism from the country's main
opposition party, the Social Democrats.
   Abortion is a common means of birth control in the Soviet bloc.
Even in Poland, where more than 90 percent of the population
consider themselves Catholic, an estimated one in two pregnancies
is terminated by abortion _ one of the highest rates in the world.
   A severe housing shortage and erratic supplies of contraceptives
contribute to the rate.
   Poland's Parliament is considering legislation backed by the
Catholic Church to make abortion a crime. Both pro-and
anti-abortion groups have held demonstrations.
   In the Soviet Union, women average six to nine abortions each
during their child-bearing years, according to Western estimates.
   The country's top-ranking woman, candidate Politburo member
Alexandra Biryukova, has complained about the number and blamed a
shortage of contraceptives.
   Abortion was legalized in many East bloc countries in the 1950s,
while contraceptives were not generally available until the 1970s,
said Jeremy Hamand, publications director of the London-based
International Planned Parenthood Federation.
   ``When they did come in, there was a whole generation of women
who had controlled their fertility by abortion,'' he said.
   Several Asian countries outlaw abortion, but it is widely
practiced in Japan and China.
   ``It was like making an appointment at the dentist,'' said one
college student who recently had an abortion in Tokyo.
   Japan bans the birth control pill because of possible side
effects. The country's main religions, Buddhism and Shintoism, do
not condemn abortion and it carries no social stigma.
   The Health Ministry in Tokyo says Japan had 17.8 registered
abortions for every 1,000 women aged 15 to 49 in 1985. However,
many go unreported, doctors say, and Japan's abortion rate might
exceed that of the United States, which had 24 terminated
pregnancies for every 1,000 females of child-bearing age that year.
   Abortion is a main form of population control in China, where
more than 10 million abortions are performed each year _ about one
for every two live births. While there is some individual
resistance to government pressures to abort unplanned babies, there
are no anti-abortion groups and the main criticism has come from
the United States.
   In predominantly Catholic Latin America, abortion is widely
illegal except in cases where the woman's life is in danger or she
is a victim of rape. There has been little or no movement to expand
those conditions.
   However, there are many illegal abortions.
   ``They're extremely common and maternal mortality is extremely
high as a result,'' said Hamand.
   In Brazil, for example, about 300,000 to 500,000 abortions are
performed a year, according to the Health Ministry.
   In an exception to the regional practice, Cuba instituted legal
abortion in 1959, soon after Fidel Castro took power, to cope with
a population boom. It is routinely performed in government
hospitals and free contraceptives are provided.

<HEAD>89-Year-Old Priest Gets Bishop's Order: No More Ox Cart</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For 60 of his 89 years, the Rev.
Arthur Le Blanc made his missionary rounds in an ox cart. Then in
April, his bishop ordered him to stop and assigned him a car.
   The bishop was just 3 years old when Le Blanc came here from the
United States and even had served as his altar boy.
   ``I was ordained the year Charles Lindbergh flew across the
Atlantic,'' Le Blanc said. Then the next year, he himself crossed
the Atlantic on a three-month journey that brought him to this
island off southeast Africa on July 10, 1928.
   He has since endured countless privations, a climate doctors in
1932 said would kill him, and only limited success in converting
the islanders to Roman Catholicism. Other Christian missionaries
haven't had much success either, since the vast majority of people
here still cling to traditional ways and to animism, a belief that
inanimate objects have consciousness and personalities.
   Le Blanc devoted his life to trying to sow Roman Catholism among
them, nevertheless, and if he wasn't a big success at that, he
achieved other things that would please a religious man.
   Six years ago he almost lost his sight; a surgical implant has
helped save it. Earlier, he nearly died from blackwater fever.
   But he kept going.
   ``His persistance is incredible. In the early 1970s `American'
was a dirty word here, but he was so accepted that the difficulties
didn't affect him,'' said the Rev. Joseph Shea, director of
personnel for La Sallete Order, to which Le Blanc belongs.
   ``Priests in the United States don't see the results of their
work,'' Le Blanc told a reporter. ``Here we do.''
   Sipping on a small glass of rum during one of his rare visits to
the capital, Le Blanc recalled that books, magazines, electricity,
even vegetables and fruit, were luxuries most of the time, and he
spent many years as the only priest in one of several towns on the
west coast.
   ``Two letters would arrive at the same time, one asking why the
other one hadn't been answered,'' he said.
   ``When you get interested in your work you can do without things
you thought were necessary in the past. You like the people, your
companion priests. That's the main thing.
   ``I'm staying until the end.''
   He doesn't plan to use a U.S. vacation due him this year; his
three brothers and two sisters have died.
   Le Blanc talked of his arrival in Madagarscar.
   ``We had no church or even a house, so we rented a villager's
house. It was our dormitory. Our dining room was in another house,
a mile away.''
   Two other priests joined him after he opened the first mission
in Morondova, 240 miles by air and until recently a two-day, and
sometimes dangerous, drive from Antananarivo.
   ``We built a wooden cathedral in Morondova. Sixty men went into
the forest and cut wood for it. It is still in use because the new
concrete one isn't finished.''
   His first task was to teach himself the Malagasy language, and
local children helped. Services were conducted in Latin but the
priests read their sermons in Malagasy.
   ``We'd make all kinds of mistakes but the people were used to
that and they were so happy we tried.''
   Newly arrived priests now get a seven-month course in the
language.
   His initial forays into the scorching heat of the baobab and
tamarind country around Morondava were taken in a palaquin, a
covered litter carried by four men who handed him to a second team
in shifts, without dropping him.
   After the government banned this practice, he began using an ox
cart, extremely expensive on the small stipends priests earn but
the only reliable form of transport.
   ``I packed my baggage, cooking gear and Mass materials into the
cart, along with coffee and sugar. I carried no food. People gave
me rice and chicken,'' he said.
   Most trips were two months or longer, dodging ant hills and
seeking shelter from the maddening Ranovory _ downpours that
occasionally burst from the usually deep blue skies. There were few
villages or other rest points en route.
   ``You wanted to stop, but where?''
   Le Blanc reckons he has gone through four or five ox carts and
an untold number of oxen. At one point, the U.S. Catholic
Missionary Vehicle Association gave him $1,500 for a new cart.
   He recalled visiting one village to see a woman who had given up
the faith to return to her former traditional beliefs.
   ``I tried without success to convince her to return and then
left her village to resume my trip.
   ``But my ox died and I had to go back to her village to find
another one. The woman said my return was a sign from heaven and
she confessed,'' he said.
   ``It was thrilling to find one person who seemed to be
interested, who asked a lot of questions.''
   Le Blanc has baptized thousands over the years, but sometimes he
would return from a long trip with no new converts or only a
handful, news that wasn't well received at church headquarters.
   ``The people are ferociously individualist and cling to their
traditional way,'' said Shea of the La Sallete Order.
   It is estimated that perhaps only 8 percent of the people in the
Morondava area are Christians. Most of the rest are animists.
   Ancestor worship is widely practiced in Madagascar, an island
whose people have oceanic origins.
   In the Morondava area several cemetaries display explicit erotic
funeral art and funerals somtimes include orgies.
   Visitors to the cemetaries are expected to make a donation to
the dead, usually a sprinkling of rum, before entering the ``spirit
domain.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier''</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS `Star Wars' to `Star Trek' in graf 3. Movie Opens June
9.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

   Suppose you were seeing a space movie you knew nothing about.
The crew of the space ship includes a black, a Japanese, a Russian,
a Scot, as well as a half-human, half-spaceling _ a regular United
Nations.
   The action is wildly improbable. When the heroes find themselves
in inescapable peril, they simply request a fat guy to remove them
to a safer place. As for special effects, they're on a par with
Saturday morning TV shows. And the dialogue features such cliches
as: ``You look as if you'd seen a ghost.'' ``I think I have,
Captain, I think I have.''
   Now, suppose you learn the movie is ``Star Trek V: The Final
Frontier.'' That changes things, right?
   ``Star Trek'' has become such a modern mythology that it defies
criticism, even when the movies descend into self-parody. Maybe
it's better simply to report the plot and let the ticket buyer
beware.
   Members of the Starship Enterprise crew are vacationing in
Yosemite, still pristine in the 23rd century. Captain Kirk is
climbing the face of El Capitan. He slips and plunges downward.
Then zip _ Spock in his jet boots manages to rescue him, preventing
a short movie.
   The crew is summoned back to the Enterprise. It's a new model,
and Chief Engineer Scott is still trying to get the bugs out. No
time. The Enterprise is ordered on a trouble-shooting mission. Some
religious zealots have conquered Nimbus III, ``the Planet of
Galactic Peace,'' and have taken hostages.
   The ramshackle Enterprise takes off, and it is tracked by Kirk's
archenemies, the strange-talking Klingons. Kirk escapes, and he
attacks the Nimbus III rebels. Kirk and party are captured and they
encounter the leader of the rebellion, a Christlike Vulcan named
Sybok. He turns out to be Spock's half-brother.
   Sybok commandeers the Enterprise for a flight past the unknown
and into a strange land where, he believes, God lives. He is sadly
disappointed.
   Action is scarce while the characters engage in metaphysical,
political and personal matters. William Shatner takes his turn at
directing (Leonard Nimoy directed No. IV), and he performs well
within script limitations. All of the crew members satisfactorily
do their shtick. Lawrence Luckinbill is impressive as the
wrongheaded Sybok.
   The Paramount Pictures release was produced by Harve Bennett
with a script by David Loughery from a story by Loughery, Shatner
and Bennett. The rating is PG, perhaps for excitement.

   ``In a Sentimental Mood'' (Warner Bros.) _ Dr. John
   
   Those who remember Dr. John as ``The Night Tripper'' who brought
a touch of bayou mysticism to the era of psychedelic rock will find
it curious to think of him as a sentimental kind of guy. Nor would
his usual concoctions of Delta blues, rock and honky-tonk lead one
to associate him with such Tin Pan Alley standards as ``More Than
You Know'' or ``Accentuate the Positive.''
   Even more unexpected are the lush string and horn arrangements
heard in the background of some of the nine tracks on this album of
classic old songs.
   But as an accomplished session player, Dr. John, a.k.a. Mac
Rebennack, is nothing if not versatile. So when he turns his
keyboard talent and his distinctive gravelly voice to sentimental
ballads such as ``Candy'' and ``My Buddy,'' he knows how to create
the right mood.
   Yet it's clear this is not the doctor's specialty. An inner
sleeve note credits Ray Charles for inspiration; the fact is, Ray
does it better.
   Dr. John's seen-it-all-and-then-some vocal style works much
better on the bluesy ``Black Night'' and on ``Makin' Whoopee,'' the
sassy duet with Rickie Lee Jones that leads off the album. Teaming
those two vocal stylists was the best idea behind this record, and
it would be great to hear more from them.
   The other highlights are the instrumental title cut (a Duke
Ellington number) and a rollicking rendition of Cole Porter's
``Love for Sale,'' both featuring Dr. John's piano playing, his
true forte.

   ``Kings of Boogie'' (GNP Crescendo) _ Savoy Brown
   
   In an age of ``classic'' soft drinks and candy bars, perhaps
Savoy Brown after 22 albums can be excused for taking on the title
``Kings of Boogie.'' But as a souvenir of the coronation, this
effort is pretty stale.
   There's plenty of boogie music here, but you've heard it all
before. On any given night, there probably are hundreds of bands in
bars across the country playing this type of music with more
inventiveness and freshness than what is displayed on ``Kings of
Boogie.''
   As always, bandleader Kim Simmons is impeccable on guitar. The
rhythm section is solid and vocalist Dave Walker can growl with the
best of them. The trouble is the material: It's tired, cliched and
forgettable.
   Oh yeah. The album's liner notes, gushing about the band's
``integrity,'' seem a little silly next to the thank you note to a
certain athletic shoe maker and the insert hawking ``Official Savoy
Brown Merchandise.''

   ``A Night to Remember'' (Epic) _ Cyndi Lauper
   
   That is Cyndi Lauper's name on the new album, ``A Night to
Remember.'' And yes, it sure sounds like her. But for all we know,
it could be Paula Abdul. Or Jody Watley. Or Debbie Gibson. Fill in
your own choice.
   Once delightfully distinctive, Lauper's taken a distressing step
backward into the sea of ``wanna-bes'' with this record. The need
for hits has made her music generic.
   The Cyndi on the ``She's So Unusual'' album was a joy to know.
She was a tough, independent woman with a marvelous set of pipes
not afraid, as the song says, to have fun. Not many artists have
the guts to defend masturbation on their first album.
   Where did that Cyndi go? On the first three songs of this new
record, Lauper defines herself through men. There's the man she
craves so much she'll drive all night to sleep with him; the man
she craves so much she feels ``primitive'' urges; the man she
craves so much she can't bear to spend that first night without him.
   The narrator could be anybody. Although Lauper shares
songwriting credit on seven of this record's tunes, all are written
at least in part by professional song doctors _ people such as
Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly who are brought in for artists
desperate for hits.
   Some of the songs are good; these people didn't get their track
record by chance. ``I Drove All Night,'' in particular, builds
nicely with fine singing by the deeper voiced Lauper. ``A Night to
Remember'' is another catchy tune. However, both are weighted down
by overly loud drumming and busy arrangements.
   Some songs are too gimmicky. ``Insecurious'' and ``Like a Cat''
are ideas that probably sounded more clever on paper.
   None of the tunes, though, really sound like Lauper's.
   Remember, this is an artist whose last single stiffed and her
first starring role in a movie, ``Vibes,'' was a disaster. This
record has the uncomfortable feel of an artist who's lost her
confidence being directed by a record company concerned about a big
investment.

<DATELINE>CAVE CREEK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Clark Gable, son of the star
Hollywood called King, has decided to follow in the profession of a
father he never knew.
   The 28-year-old Gable is co-starring with James Brolin and
Richard Roundtree in the Western ``Bad Jim,'' produced by Menahem
Golan's new 21st Century Film Corp.
   The movie has been shooting in the desert plains and arroyos
northwest of Phoenix, and so far young Gable has drawn high marks
from his co-stars and director, Clyde Ware.
   ``I think he's got a lot of his father in him,'' Ware said.
``He's never really acted before, he's never wanted to act before.
He's a race driver. Imagine carrying the load of being the King's
son. I think he carries it very well.''
   The resemblance is hard to fathom. John Clark's face is long and
thin, compared to his father's square-jawed look, and his hair is
light brown, while Gable's was dark. Their height is the same, but
the son is slender and wiry. The greatest similarity is in the
voices. Both crackle with no-nonsense authority.
   One recent afternoon before shooting began, Gable sat down
before a frontier saloon amid a clutter of ramshackle movie sets
called Cow Town and submitted to a rare interview.
   ``Submitted'' is an apt word, since Gable does not easily reveal
himself. That is natural after a childhood in which his mother, Kay
Spreckels Gable, strove mightily to keep him out of public view.
   ``I am a private person,'' he admitted, crediting ``a little
help from my wife.'' She is Tracy Yarro, and they have a daughter,
Kayley, 3, and a son, Clark James, 7 months. But how is he going to
cope with the publicity spotlight that's generated as a movie actor?
   ``Real simple,'' he said, ``just as if I'm a rolling billboard
out there in the desert. I'll play it the same way. It's the same
as in racing: It's all advertising and product.'' He is sponsored
by B.F. Goodrich and American Racing Wheels in his racing career.
   Does he enjoy interviews?
   A rare grin: ``Please don't put me on a spot like that. Yes and
no. It depends.''
   John Clark Gable was born in 1960, three months after his father
died of a heart attack at the conclusion of ``The Misfits.'' The
boy spent his first 13 years on the 22-acre Gable ranch in the
middle of Encino. The property has since been subdivided into
luxury estates, and the Gable house is now occupied by indicted
junk-bond king Michael Milken.
   ``I went back there once and it made me sick,'' he said. ``I
drove up the driveway to my old house and was so appalled at what
had been done to it that I turned around and drove away.''
   Kay Gable protected her son from the press and other intruders,
sending him to private schools _ Buckley in West Los Angeles and
Brooks Prep in Andover, Mass.
   ``She didn't like the way people handled interviews, and she
wanted to protect me,'' Gable recalled. ``She was afraid of
possible kidnapping. She always told me that my father told her,
`One actor in the family is enough.'''
   Gable spent a year at Aiglon College in Villars, Switzerland,
then graduated from Santa Monica City College in 1983. His fields
of study included ``art, ceramics, a lot of science, art history.''
Nothing related to the entertainment business.
   During his college years, Gable became engrossed in motor cross
racing, much to his mother's distress (she died in 1983). He has
jolted through the grueling Baja California race for almost 24
hours straight. Twice he has had serious accidents in races; one
required seven hours of surgery. After four years of motor cross he
switched to class-A trucks.
   What's so great about racing?
   ``I just love it, the excitement of it,'' he said. ``There's
nothing like racing across the desert. They used to cross the
desert in covered wagons back in the 1800s. We're just modern-day
cowboys in full-sized pickups now. It's pretty much the same thing;
we just go a little faster and a little harder.
   ``Fear? I have no fear. I have more fear when I get on a horse.''
   Two years ago friends saw him in television interviews about his
racing and suggested John Clark could make it as an actor. He
studied for two years in acting school _ ``a lot of improvisation,
a lot of classroom work, a lot of work on my feet, with other
actors or solo pieces, the basic things you learn in acting
school.''
   Ware submitted a script that Gable didn't like, then he was sold
on ``Bad Jim.'' Now John Clark would like to do more acting _
``especially action and adventure films; I'm not very much into
romance or any of that.''
   John Clark first became aware of his famed father at a home
screening of ``Gone With the Wind.''
   ``I was 2 years old, and I couldn't sit through the whole movie
at that point in my life,'' he recalled. ``I was kind of
rambunctious at that age.''
   On another occasion he threw a glass of punch at the screen when
he saw his father kissing another woman.
   ``I really didn't know my father,'' he remarked. ``I used to
love to hear my mother tell stories about him. I was very lucky
that I was able to see my father on film _ what he looked like,
acting, talking, moving. I didn't really know much about my dad
except the stories I've heard.''
   Gable hasn't seen his father's 66 films, but he hopes to see
them all some day. His favorites are: ``The Misfits,'' ``San
Francisco,'' ``Test Pilot'' (his very favorite), ``Mogambo,''
``Gone With the Wind'' (``of course''), ``Mutiny on the Bounty''
and ``Soldier of Fortune.''
   He was asked for a capsule portrait of the man who was called
King. His reply:
   ``He was a very rugged, outgoing man. He was very social and
generous to people, but he also had a very private life. He loved
hunting. He loved fishing. He loved fast cars. He loved motorcycles
and horses.''
   That might also sound like a picture of John Clark Gable.
   `Uh-huh,'' he admitted. ``It might run in the blood.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Little Opera Fills the Bowery With Mozart and Puccini</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stage doors sometimes stick, and smoke effects
have gone up in flames. Costumes are homemade or hand-me-downs, and
actors race out the theater's back door, through a parking lot and
past derelicts on the street to make front stage entrances.
   It's all part of high opera in a distinctly low-brow area called
the Bowery, one of New York City's dingier spots.
   With a 24-hour car park on one side, a transient hotel and
punk-rock club on the other, the narrow, four-story Amato Opera
Theatre fills the Bowery with strains of Mozart and Puccini.
   This everyman's opera company is the creation of Tony Amato, who
fell in love with opera as a youngster shortly after emigrating
with his family from Minori, Italy, to the United States.
   But the Amato theater's unprepossessing style is no cover for
amateurish ways. Since Amato launched his opera theater 41 years
ago, 65 alumni have graduated to the Metropolitan Opera, New York
City Opera and other companies in the United States.
   ``He was a beacon for me. There was a place I could go at a very
young age and learn,'' said Neil Shicoff, a lead tenor at the Met.
He went to Amato when he was 19 after being rejected by the
Juilliard School. After three years with the Amato, Juilliard
accepted him.
   ``The learning techniques of how to act were really from Tony,''
the 39-year-old Shicoff recalled in a recent interview. ``How to
stand, how to really look at another singer and how to not lose the
audience when you do that, or how not to sing directly to the side,
into the wings.
   ``It was only when I sang on an international level that I
realized how good Tony was. He really could take somebody from
scratch and teach you stuff which a lot of directors can't do.''
   Attracted by that reputation, Amato's amateur casts of hundreds
trek over after office hours from throughout the city for a chance
to learn opera's heroic and obscure roles, staging and later to
perform full-length operas before tiny audiences. The converted
storehouse seats about 100; folding chairs are set up for sellouts.
   At the Amato, only the scenic designer and musicians are paid;
the Amatos receive rent for the building. An annual grant from the
New York State Council of the Arts for $4,000, ticket sales at $12
each, a handful of contract performances and contributions keep the
shows running. Last year's annual budget was the highest ever,
$100,000. The season usually includes five productions of about 10
performances each.
   ``People don't really do it for money,'' said 24-year-old Mark
Freiman, who made his debut in March as the lead in ``The Marriage
of Figaro.''
   Amato, a short whirlwind of energy, controls almost every aspect
of his company. He chooses the operas, stages the productions,
directs the actors, changes the scenery, conducts the orchestra.
He's the master of ceremonies, announcing winners of raffles for
Amato T-shirts and videotaped operas. During a performance of
``Faust'' several years ago, Amato even put down the baton to
extinguish a fire when a smoke effect went awry.
   ``My theory is that to have good theater, one man has to be in
charge. When you have a stage director, a music director, a scenic
director and a costume director _ too much friction, too much time
wasted. I experienced it many, many years ago. That's why I decided
to do everything myself.
   ``I used to be a singer. I still sing once in a while, in an
emergency,'' said the 68-year-old Amato, who toured the United
States with regional opera companies as a tenor.
   ``Opera in those days was very bad, badly put together, and I
always realized the lack of good theater in it. So when I had a
chance to, I started teaching to earn some extra income. I realized
how much I could give to it.''
   Dubbed the ``two-penny opera'' in one newspaper account of the
theater's history, the Amato seems to pride itself on making the
most of less. His wife, Sally, helps wherever needed, from sewing
costumes to singing last-minute roles. Props are inventive. Dry
oatmeal was used once for snow, but discontinued when hordes of
mice invaded. Sets are reused, carefully patched up so age doesn't
show.
   The orchestra pit is literally that: a cramped, cellar-like area
mostly under the stage with barely enough space for one upright
piano and the usual accompaniment of 10 musicians. The concession
stand is a small table in the back of the room, where Amato's
sister-in-law sells coffee and homemade rum balls and cookies.
   When scenes call for front stage entrances, actors must race out
the theater's back door, through the parking lot, past a varying
assortment of vagrants, alcoholics and drug addicts and in through
the theater's front door.
   Amato moved his theater to the Bowery 29 years ago. ``Instead of
having dope addicts, we had wine addicts,'' Amato said.
   But there's been no trouble, and sometimes he invites his
neighbors of the street in for a show.
   ``I say if you dress clean I'll let you come in, and they do.
You'd be surprised the knowledge (of opera) some of them have, it's
incredible,'' he said.
   The contrast between the art form and the neighborhood is often
startling.
   ``We're always running around with our costumes on. The bums,
they stare at you and sometimes they think they have had too much
to drink,'' Freiman said. ``Usually when you wear your costume no
one says anything because it's New York.''
   But during one opera, which required tie and tails, several men
asked Freiman for money because they thought he was rich.
   ``It was weird,'' Shicoff recalled. ``I would sing a performance
down there and I would feel on top of the world and you would walk
outside and somebody's laying in the gutter. It's a very strange
dichotomy of emotions.''
   Despite its humble stature, the Amato sometimes attracts opera
critics from such publications as The New York Times and The New
Yorker, especially when it puts on operas not often performed
elsewhere. The generally favorable reviews are plastered throughout
the theater.
   ``Unlike some large opera companies, which dazzle the spectator
initially but then sputter, the Amato Opera's production pulls the
listener in very gradually, gaining momentum as it progresses,''
wrote the Times' Tim Page in a review of Offenbach's ``Tales of
Hoffman'' in 1986.
   Amato used to have more grandiose aspirations than his spot on
the Bowery.
   ``Years ago, I believe I had an ambition to get to the
Metropolitan,'' he said. ``But not for the past 20 years, because I
know I could do more here to help the young artists get ahead and
learn the trade.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Reggae's Got Soul and Toots Hibbert</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Reggae has had its ups and downs over the past
decade, but Frederick ``Toots'' Hibbert just keeps playing.
   Hibbert, who has been making music since the early 1960s before
the word reggae ever hit American music stores, is back with his
first LP since 1981, ``Toots in Memphis,' a collection of soul
standards.
   His raspy voice, capable of sweetness and toughness, has been
likened to the late Otis Redding, one of soul's greatest singers.
The reggae star covers a pair of obscure Redding songs, ``I've Got
Dreams to Remember,'' and ``Hard to Handle.'' He also sings the
rhythm 'n' blues hit, ``Knock on Wood,'' and Al Green's ``Love and
Happiness.''
   ``I always listened to Al Green, Otis and Michael Jackson,
Stevie Wonder,'' Hibbert said. ``We are related somewhat.''
   Reggae's most famous rhythm section, Sly Dunbar and Robbie
Shakespeare, plays on the record. Also featured are guitarist
Teenie Hodges, who helped write ``Love and Happiness,'' and Andrew
Love of the Memphis Horns.
   Many of soul's greatest artists, including Redding, Wilson
Pickett and Aretha Franklin, recorded in Memphis. The idea for
making an album there often had been suggested to Hibbert, and the
singer finally contacted Island Records president Chris Blackwell
to express his interest.
   ``I'm not just a reggae singer,'' Hibbert explained. ``I can
sing anything, any song, rewrite the song and make it into my
style.''
   Thanks to young artists such as Ziggy Marley and Maxi Priest,
reggae has enjoyed a resurgence over the past year, inspiring those
who long for a return to the music's heyday of the early 1970s.
   Few of the stars who first made reggae internationally popular
are still around. Bob Marley, the music's most celebrated artist,
died of cancer in 1980. Peter Tosh, Marley's onetime bandmate and a
major performer in his own right, was murdered in 1987. Jimmy
Cliff, whose talents were featured in the popular reggae film,
``The Harder They Come,'' is no longer a commercial success.
   In the early '60s, Hibbert formed a ska trio, ``The Vikings,''
with Raleigh Gordon and Jerry Mathias. They quickly became one of
Jamaica's most popular acts, with Prince Buster producing and
Hibbert leading the way on a series of local hits, ``Pain in My
Belly,'' ``Little Flea'' and ``Dog War.''
   The group renamed itself the Maytals in 1966 and won that year's
Jamaican Festival Song competition with ``Bam, Bam.'' Hibbert
formed a permanent niche in reggae history by giving the music its
name in a 1968 song, ``Do the Reggay.''
   ``We were just playing around,'' Hibbert recalled. ``We used to
have slogans, jokes. Sometimes we'd say of a girl that's not
looking so great, `She's like a streggae.' That word was there and
one morning I said, `Let's do the `reggae.' I didn't think that the
name would last.''
   Under the production of Leslie Kong, the Maytals entered their
peak of popularity with a string of songs that became reggae
standards: ``Funky Kingston,'' ``54-46 That's My Number'' and
``Pressure Drop,'' a featured number in ``The Harder They Come.''
   But Hibbert was anxious to experiment with other forms of music,
covering the rock 'n' roll oldie ``Louie, Louie,'' and a
surprisingly danceable version of John Denver's ``Take Me Home,
Country Roads.'' Hibbert was surprised himself when he learned who
performed the original song.
   ``When I listened to it first I thought it was Ray Charles and I
always liked Ray Charles' sound,'' he said. ``I have a
country-and-western voice, very high pitched. I can find that voice
anytime.''
   Many reggae stars have been outspoken politically. Bob Marley's
active support for Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley led to an
assasination attempt in 1976.
   Priest and ``Burning Spear'' have each recorded tributes to the
late black nationalist leader, Marcus Garvey. Ziggy Marley's latest
album has several political songs.
   But Hibbert, who broke up with the Maytals in the early '80s,
prefers to concentrate on personal matters. ``I don't write about
politics,'' the singer noted. ``I write about naturality, about
real things that happen to real people.''
   One of Hibbert's most popular songs is ``Love Is Gonna to Let Me
Down,'' a heartfelt ballad.
   ``It's about a girl, and I'm giving encouragement,'' he said.
``It can mean anybody, male or female. `Everytime I see your face,
something moves in my heart.' I believe in love so even if love
lets you down, love also never dies.''
   He also differs from other reggae musicians by not being a
member of the Rastafarian religious sect. ``Reggae Got Soul'' is a
better way of expressing Hibbert's philosophy.
   ``I know it's got soul and if you got talent and soul, you can
sing it,'' he said. ``Everybody's got soul. Reggae music is the
music that carries love and good principles with it.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: A Dying Son and a Difficult Book</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With 80 pages of his first novel completed,
Alexander Stuart received some tragic news: His 3-year-old son,
Joe, was dying of cancer.
   Feeling a ``huge rage at the injustice of it,'' Stuart divided
time between the hospital and the typewriter, throwing himself into
his work.
   The book he had started was hardly a sentimental love story.
Stuart wanted to write about the troubles of a seemingly ``normal''
middle-class English family and decided to use the teen-age son's
discovery of an affair between his father and sister as the central
plot.
   Stuart had originally conceived a low-key approach but changed
his mind after learning of his son's illness. Joe Stuart died in
January at age 5.
   ``It actually proved to be the perfect vehicle in a way to
release my feelings, because it pushed me closer to the edge,''
explained Stuart, whose book is called ``The War Zone'' ($16.95,
Doubleday).
   ``I wanted to write a book which would explore incest without
being too disturbing. The more I researched, the more I realized
it's a very destructive process. I don't think anybody could come
out of it without being damaged.
   ``My son's illness allowed me do it head on, to try and take it
all the way. I hope it's dangerous but in a responsible way. I hope
it challenges what you think and feel, but at the same time feels
true.''
   Stuart's wife was pregnant when the writer developed the idea
for ``The War Zone.'' With Stuart about to become a father, he
became curious about the relationships between parents and children.
   ``I was very fascinated by friends and their fathers, and
friends and their daughters and what seemed to be an electric
spark. I would watch the daughters with their fathers, flirting
with them and their friends. I wondered what it would be like to
have a teen-age daughter.''
   The book's narrator, Tom, is an alienated teen-ager enraged with
his father and sister and cynical about the world in general. The
34-year-old Stuart drew on his own disenchantment.
   ``I think it definitely comes out of something I felt at his age
and now. He certainly does experience disillusionment. He's
horrified by what his father is doing. What interested me in Tom's
character was that whole area of exclusion. All of us feel excluded
at some time.''
   Stuart, born in 1955, grew up in the English town of Bexley,
Kent. His childhood had little of the trauma suffered by Tom, but
Stuart learned that several people from his supposedly quiet
hometown eventually committed suicide.
   ``I do feel disillusioned in a sense. It's very hard to maintain
in life the excitement you had at 12, 13 or 14. Why can't it be as
wonderful as it seems to promise at that age? I suppose that's
partly what the book's about.''
   He did have a sister and remembered the shifting alliances when
confronting their parents.
   ``We used to side against them at times. At other times you sort
of chop each other to get out of something. Certainly, as a kid all
of us have played our father against our mother,'' the author said.
   ``It seems to me the passions within the family are
extraordinary to start with. The family is the environment in which
you tend to develop your relationship skills, if you like. The book
takes it one step further.
   He insisted, however, that the family portrayed in ``The War
Zone'' was purely fictional.
   ``Both my parents read the book and are somewhat stunned by it.
But at least they don't recognize themselves in it. Obviously, one
is influenced by one's childhood, but I did work hard in recreating
something fictional from my own experiences and friends I had
spoken to.''
   Film, not writing, was Stuart's first love. The author wrote the
screenplays for ``Ordeal by Innocence'' and Nicholas Roeg's
``Insignificance,'' and sees similarities between the written word
and moving pictures.
   ``I was fascinated by visual language,'' he said. ``I don't see
it as a division. To me, it's all about using the language that's
available. The camera can be used emotionally, like Martin
Scorcese's `Mean Streets.'
   ``When I write I think in terms of the emotion I'd want if it
were in a film, and than translate and get it onto the page.''
   He was struggling financially while writing ``The War Zone,''
but was too distressed about his son to notice.
   ``I had a huge overdraft, a huge mortgage and was really kind of
feeling worried financially,'' Stuart said. ``But once he was ill
the financial problems didn't matter, they became completely
irrelevant. It doesn't mean anything like seeing your son dying
from cancer.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: The Country Queen of Hurt and Lonely</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tammy Wynette's life has had as many turmoils as
a country music song lyric.
   She's had five marriages; her daughter, Tina, had meningitis as
an infant; she's had medical and painkiller-dependency problems;
her house burned; 256 hours of tapes for her autobiography burned
in another fire; and she filed for bankruptcy last fall.
   A settlement was made in March, the bankruptcy is withdrawn and
she's able now to explain about protecting herself with chapter 11.
   But Wynette isn't trying to change her image as the country
queen of hurt and lonely. ``It's often said I spoke for the wronged
woman,'' she says.
   Her current single, ``Thank the Cowboy for the Ride,'' is
cheerful. She is healthy and has been happily married, since 1978,
to George Richey, who manages her career. They met 22 years ago,
when he was writing songs for her with record producer Billy
Sherrill, who gave her the stage name Tammy to go with her middle
name Wynette. She was born Virginia Wynette Pugh.
   ``I think that's one reason our marriage has been good and
lasted,'' Wynette says. ``We were buddies first. We worked well
together. We could talk.
   ``When Richey and I got married, Billy Sherrill said, `There
will be no more sad songs written.' He was right.''
   But she can still sing sad songs. ``I remember how I felt when I
wrote the song or what was happening in my life when I first heard
it and recorded it. I couldn't get the feeling across to them (the
audience) if I didn't go back and put myself in that position.''
   She and Richey wrote only one song on her new album, ``When a
Girl Becomes a Wife,'' for her youngest daughter, Georgette, who
was married in March in Red Bay, Ala. Her older daughters are Gwen,
Jackie and Tina, who was married last year.
   Wynette's new album, ``Next to You,'' her 51st for CBS, does
contain some heartbroken and wronged-woman songs, such as ``You
Left Memories Layin' (All Over the Place)'' and ``Liar's Roses.''
   ``A sad song makes you reflect back on something in your life
that has happened. You can feel part of that song,'' she said.
   She was interviewed while in New York for her first appearance
at the Bottom Line. Wynette is on a national tour these days. She
tours 11 months a year in the United States and Europe, and takes
off three weeks in December. ``I've got a beautiful house in
Nashville and I live on a bus.''
   The blond singer seems to glow with health. ``It feels good to
feel good,'' she said. ``I haven't had any problems since surgery
2{ years ago. I had one operation and formed adhesions, which
caused the rest of the operations. I'm one of those people who form
scar tissue.''
   About filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, protection against
creditors, Wynette said she and her husband had money in the
development of two Florida shopping centers. The first sold and all
went well. When the second sold, she said, the money was dispersed
to the other partners and her bank credit wasn't paid off.
   ``They sent a federal marshal to our house. They were going to
take everything we had and we didn't owe the money,'' she said.
   ``I think they thought we wouldn't want my name dragged through
fighting that. Whether they dragged my name through mud or not, we
had to do it. They wanted $1.2 million. If you don't owe it, why
pay it? We'd worked too hard to have what we had to let somebody
take it. We made a settlement of $450,000 in November and didn't
get the paperwork done until March 9. We paid them and they're out
of our life now.''
   Richey said three bankers were indicted in the case.
   ``We couldn't explain this while we were in litigation,''
Wynette said. ``I had to just say, yes, I'd filed for bankruptcy.
It was horrible to have to go through it. You don't think people
will do that to you. It's over with. That's all that matters now.''
   Paul Richey, her husband's brother, and Ed Bruce, who wrote
``Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys,'' wrote the
current single, ``Thank the Cowboy for the Ride.''
   ``It's a cute little song,'' Wynette said. ``It starts, `He was
pushing 7 and I was barely 5, when he rode up on his broomstick
horse and said, ``You want a ride?'' It goes on, `He's almost 67; I
admit to 39.' When I've done it on stage, old and young people love
it.''
   Her favorite song written with her husband is ``Till I Can Make
It on My Own.''
   ``George Jones and I had just divorced. The song said exactly
what I was living.'' She and Jones worked together after the
divorce but stopped that several years ago.
   ``He's happy. I'm happy. Our daughter is happy. We had magic
years ago. To try and go back and recapture that would probably be
a mistake. It's probably best we leave it like it is.''

   ``Memories of Me'' (CBS@Fox Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated PG-13)
   
   ``Memories of Me'' is almost a completely forgettable movie
until its final third, when there's _ finally _ some action to the
drama about a father and son trying to reconcile their years of
estrangement.
   ``Memories'' is Henry Winkler's first outting as a director and
it shows in the movie's pacing. Much of the beginning is plodding
and self-consciously slow. Poignant moments when young Dr. Abbie
Polin (Billy Crystal), reflects on his callous father hang
relentlessly on dead air.
   Crystal co-wrote the film and added a girlfriend (JoBeth
Williams) for himself, whose role in the melodrama-comedy is vague.
At times, her only purpose seems to be to admire Crystal's
posterior or his sexual prowess.
   The plot finally gets going when Abbie, after suffering a mild
heart attack, treks from New York to Los Angeles to resolve the
decades of paternal indifference. Once there, he learns that his
father, Abe the King of Hollywood Extras (Alan King), is terminally
ill.
   They try to win a speaking part in a movie for Abe, and validate
his oft-repeated claim, ``I am an actor.'' In the process, Abbie
comes to love his curmudgeonly dad, who returns the favor by
softening enough to tell Abbie he loves him, too, and that in his
role as father he was simply miscast.
   It gets a bit cornball after this, but the ending is far more
compelling than the beginning and worth slogging through the slow
start.

   ``Child's Play'' (MGM-UA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   Meet Chucky. He makes Jason look like a wimp, and he could take
on Freddy in any nightmare. No problem.
   Andy Barclay is a lonely lad until Chucky comes into his life.
Chucky is all the rage, he's a Good Guy Doll and every little boy
has one. Chucky is just as cute as a button with his shock of red
hair, coveralls, sneakers and wide innocent smile.
   
   Chucky also is a malevolent mound of plastic whose soul is pure
evil.
   It is the soul of a sadistic murderer who learns enough of a
voodoo ritual to zap out of his body as it lay dying in a toy store
and into the doll's so he can live forever and settle a few scores.
   ``Child's Play'' is more than just an odyssey of revenge; it is
a chiller that will make you think twice about cuddling those ugly
little Cabbage Patch kids or visiting Barbie's townhouse.
   
   Tom Holland (``Fright Night''), who also wrote the screenplay
with Don Mancini and John Lafia, plunges into the story with a
fast-break shootout in Chicago between the psychotic Charles Lee
Ray (Brad Dourif) and police. Detective Mike Norris (Chris
Sarandon) follows him into a toy store and slaughters Ray with a
hail of bullets. Ray, though, has one more trump card up his
bloodied sleeve.
   Cut to the Barclay home. Andy (Alex Vincent) is making breakfast
(and a major mess) for his mom while he watches a Good Guys
commercial on television. It's his way of buttering her up so he
can get a doll for his birthday. But mom just can't afford it.
Later that day, her friend, Maggie, takes her to a street peddler
who's selling one for a fraction of the actual price. It is, of
course, the doll Ray clutched as he died.
   Like most children in horror movies Andy perceives evil long
before the grownups do, and knows that his life must depend on his
own wits.
   Holland slowly develops the horror and first unleashes it when
Maggie (Dinah Manoff) baby-sits for Andy. After ordering Andy to
bed and turning off the late night news, she's surprised to
suddenly hear the TV and see Chucky sitting in a chair before the
set.
   It's not quite the heartstopper the next few scenes turn out to
be. With her back to the hall, Maggie hears tiny footsteps rushing
by. She thinks it's Andy. Silly woman. And like all baby-sitters in
these flicks, she's the first to go: Chucky hammers in her head and
she crashes through the sixth-floor window to the street below.
   Another good chill scene is when Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks)
discovers the doll doesn't have any batteries in his pack and yet
speaks. With a turn almost as frightening as Linda Blair's head
swirl in ``The Exorcist,'' Chucky snarls at Karen with a demonic
sneer and tells her in some choice four-letter words exactly what
he thinks of her.
   The terror's afoot, climaxing in a scene that makes the
Cuisinart bit in the ``Gremlins'' look like a picnic with Mary
Poppins.
   Holland reteams with Sarandon, who starred as the vampire in
``Night Fright.'' Sarandon's so-called tough urban accent is forced
and a distraction. Alex Vincent is adorable in his film debut. But
the real star is Chucky, who's far more interesting than his human
counterparts. Kevin Yagher designed and supervised the operation of
the killer doll.

   Ein Heldenleben, Four Last Songs, by Richard Strauss; Vienna
Philharmonic Orchestra; Arleen Auger, soprano; Andre Previn,
conductor (Telarc).
   
   Some works are so powerful and interpretations of them so
distinct and beautiful that it is difficult to compare other
versions. That's the problem here. Arleen Auger's recording of the
Four Last Songs is quite good, but it must contend with the
memorable interpretation of Elizabeth Schwartzkopf.
   Schwartzkopf sings these songs with such clarity and personality
that it's difficult for anybody else not to sound on the blander
side of the character meter.
   But there's a lot of good to be said for this disc.
   Auger always sings prettily, except for a surprising coarseness
in the long phrase of the words ``freien Flugen Schweben'' (``free
flight soaring'') of the song ``Beim Schlafengehen'' (``Time to
Sleep.'') The American soprano also sings with an appealing
simplicity.
   Strauss wrote these sometimes melancholy, sometimes soaring and
always beautiful songs the year before his death in 1949 at 86. If
you're looking for a recording of them specifically, look to
Schwartzkopf, who recorded them twice for Angel. If you're looking
for something from the latest crop of new releases, think about
this disc.
   The Vienna gives a polished and rousing performance of Ein
Heldenleben and sounds great throughout. Previn, in the songs,
keeps the long lines moving and has a sense of drama in ``A Hero's
Life.''

   ``Boingo Alive'' (MCA) _ Oingo Boingo
   
   Live albums have a unique sort of energy. Unfortunately, they
also have crowd noise, which can distract from the performance and
discourage cranking of the volume knob.
   Oingo Boingo, a veteran eight-piece band with a reputation of
being better on stage than on record, has overcome the problem of
unwelcome audience participation with ``Boingo Alive.'' The double
album was recorded live, but on a soundstage, sans audience. The
strategy works _ the music has the spark of a live performance and
captures Oingo Boingo at its best.
   The band careens at a breathless pace through 10 years of
material, delivering 21 songs on the LP, 30 on compact disc. Two
are tunes never previously recorded.
   ``Alive'' naturally kicks off with ``Dead Man's Party'' (``Leave
your body and soul at the door''). Led by a three-piece horn
section, the Boingos quickly establish a killer groove. Other
highlights include the rocking ``Just Another Day,'' a guitar tour
de force; the catchy call of distress ``Private Life,'' a hit in
1982; and ``Only Makes Me Laugh,'' which shows off the band's great
singing.
   Lead vocalist Danny Elfman is the big star, although some of his
mannerisms make you wonder if he's really Freddie Mercury. (After
all, when is the last time you saw or heard anything about the
singer for Queen?) Anyway, this is a great primer from a good band,
and about half the cuts are capable of charring your turntable.

   Prince Myshkin slumps back in his chair, lifting a
shawl from behind him and pulling it over his shoulders. He slips
on a pair of earrings, and with a smooth shift in bearing and
expression _ and no other props _ transforms onstage into the
glamorous heroine Nastasya.
   Tamasaburo Bando, one of Japan's most popular kabuki stars,
performs the remarkable change between male and female characters
in ``Nastasya,'' a play based on Dostoevsky's novel ``The Idiot''
directed by the award-winning Polish filmmaker Andrzej Wajda.
   For the 38-year-old Tamasaburo, playing more than one role is
nothing new. He's handled as many as seven in a single kabuki drama.
   But as an ``onnagata,'' or actor who plays women's roles in the
male-only world of kabuki performers, Tamasaburo finds the role of
Prince Myshkin more difficult than the transformation into a woman.
   ``At first I felt awkward because I've always played women in
the past,'' he said in an interview. ``I felt like I was wearing
another layer of clothes _ and Western clothes at that.''
   In the play, an adaptation of the last chapter of ``The Idiot,''
Myshkin and his rival, Rogozhin, reminisce over their past with
Nastasya, who lies dead behind a curtain, murdered by the impulsive
Rogozhin.
   In a series of flashbacks, Tamasaburo changes back and forth
between the epileptic Myshkin and alluring Nastasya. Only at the
end of the play does he wear a dress, after a kabuki-like
lightning-quick costume change offstage.
   Wajda staged the play in Poland in 1977 using just the two male
characters, with Nastasya only mentioned in the dialogue. But in
1980, while visiting Japan, the Polish director saw Tamasaburo
perform a woman's role in ``La Dame aux Camellias'' and decided to
ask him to portray the roles of both Myshkin and Nastasya in a
Japanese production.
   ``I don't know of any other actor who would give me the chance
to create both male and female roles on stage without any change in
makeup or costume,'' Wajda said when the play opened.
   At a recent performance, the audience sat almost motionless
through the two-hour, single-act drama. The gloomy stage, the size
of a large living room, is surrounded by the theater's 160 seats,
none more than a few feet away. Wajda chose the small theater to
preserve the dark, oppressive mood of Dostoevsky's writing.
   ``Kabuki is really a kind of enjoyable show, with dramatic
colors, dance and music,'' Tamasaburo said. ``In that way it's
entirely different from Dostoevsky's heaviness. But my goal in both
is to link hearts with the audience.''
   To prepare for the part of Nastasya, Tamasaburo watched old
American movies, carefully studying the gestures and movements of
such actresses as Claudette Colbert and Greta Garbo.
   Despite Wajda and Tamasaburo's disparate backgrounds and
language barrier _ Wajda directed the play in Polish, though the
dialogue was in Japanese _ Tamasaburo says they communicated well.
   ``I could barely understand what he was saying, but people's
feelings are expressed not only by words,'' he said.
   Wajda is best known for political movies such as ``Ashes and
Diamonds,'' about Poland during World War II, and ``Man of Iron,''
made during the Solidarity trade union's strike at Gdansk shipyard.
   ``I think, for him, the link between people's hearts and art is
the most important thing,'' Tamasaburo said. ``Because he grew up
in Poland, he was forced to become involved with politics.''
   Tamasaburo is graceful in his movements, elegant and, many fans
say, beautiful. His popularity resembles that of a movie star or
popular singer, and his fan club attracts both men and women.
   Like many kabuki actors, his rigid training began at age six.
   ``As a child, I was interested in anything to do with theater.
My parents told me that if I were going to perform in Japan, then I
should become a kabuki actor.''
   The training included dance, classical singing, musical
instruments, flower arranging, tea ceremony and calligraphy.
   ``Because kabuki is closely linked to the arts, every major role
involves performing one of the arts,'' he said.
   In 1970, at age 20, Tamasaburo stunned Japanese audiences with
his portrayal of Lady MacBeth in a production of the Shakespeare
play, becoming only the second kabuki actor to play a female role
in a Western drama since the Meiji period, more than 75 years ago.
   He performs with the stage name Tamasaburo Bando V, a
combination of the names of previous accomplished actors, granted
in recognition of his abilities.
   Kabuki's history is traced back to 1603, the beginning of
Japan's 250 years of self-imposed isolation, when a female shrine
attendant in Kyoto led an outdoor performance of dance and mime by
a predominately female cast to raise money for shrine repairs.
   The theatrical form boomed among common people, but the Tokugawa
military shogunate in 1629 banned females from appearing in kabuki
after performances became increasingly erotic and linked to
prostitution.
   Today, many Japanese believe that kabuki ``onnagata'' are better
than women at portraying classic feminine grace and beauty.
   ``I've played women for 30 years, so I can switch to a female
character whenever I want, like switching to a foreign language,''
Tamasaburo said.
   ``It's a matter of association. When I put on the shawl, I
think, `I'm a woman,' and unconsciously begin acting like one. Then
when I take off the shawl, I return to being myself.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Etheridge Takes the Slow Road to Overnight Success</HEAD>

   Melissa Etheridge may have attended the
prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, but she's getting
her education in a series of one-night stops in crowded music clubs
across the country.
   It's been an eye-opening experience for many music fans, too.
   The emotionally intense rocker, whose debut album last year was
largely overlooked in a flood of records by female
singer-songwriters, is building a following with energetic live
shows that are quickly selling out through word of mouth.
   ``Looking back, I like how it happened,'' said the 27-year-old
Etheridge, shortly before stepping on stage for another sold-out
show. ``But when I'm there and in it, I was thinking, `why isn't
this getting noticed?'''
   Maybe it was the downbeat tone of her spare-sounding first
album, fueled by stories of jealousy and rejection in love. Her
vivid songwriting also teeters on the edge of cliche, with
prominent fire and steel metaphors.
   But her concerts are a revelation, which a national audience
learned when she sang her Grammy-nominated ``Bring Me Some Water''
on the national awards show in February.
   The tiny Etheridge bounces across the stage, belting out her
songs in a gruff voice that recalls Tina Turner, and fixing her
audience with a piercing stare and smile. Increasingly, audience
members are shouting her lyrics back at her.
   Etheridge grew up in Leavenworth, Kan., and was given her first
guitar at age 8. Like many in her generation, one of her first
musical memories was listening to the Beatles' ``I Want to Hold
Your Hand'' through a transistor radio.
   Her parents didn't dissuade her from a musical career _ her
father even drove her to performances before she got her driver's
license _ but said if she was serious, she had to get a serious
education. So they sent her to Berklee.
   ``I learned some things, but for what I do it wasn't all that
useful,'' she said of her formal music education. ``I knew it was a
way out of a small town.''
   She knew the real way to learn her craft was to take her
acoustic guitar onstage. Etheridge did that in Boston and later in
the Los Angeles area, where Island Records founder Chris Blackwell
spotted her in a tiny Long Beach club and signed her to a contract.
   Etheridge swears it wasn't a conscious decision to put out a
record that deals almost exclusively with the dark side of love.
   ``It wasn't until after I recorded them and sat down and
listened to them 1 through 10 that I said, `people are going to
think I'm pretty upset about something,''' she said.
   On ``Bring Me Some Water,'' Etheridge is ``burning alive'' with
jealousy over a lover who's abandoned her for another. The anger on
``Like the Way I Do'' is directed outward, with Etheridge asking an
old flame whether a new lover can ``shock and electrify and rock
you ... like the way I do.''
   All of her songs are autobiographical. The ones on her first
album traced from a ``dark period'' in her life, she said.
   ``I was in a real learning situation,'' she said. ``I was
learning a lot about relationships and my career. It was a whole
lot of things going on at once. ... I'm a little older now. I've
learned some of those lessons now.''
   Etheridge jokes about her image during concert appearances.
   ``Everywhere I go people ask me, `Melissa, why are you so sad?'
I tell them I'm not so sad,'' she says with a sly grin. ``I'm just
experienced.''
   Her unreleased material, which accounts for about half her live
show, doesn't stray much from her basic sound. But many of the
songs are cheerier and, encouragingly, even stronger than those on
her debut.
   Etheridge's second album, with the working title ``Brave and
Crazy'' is already recorded and is scheduled for release this fall.
She'll be on the road for most of the summer, usually as an opening
act for Little Feat.
   Her track record on the road is even surprising some veteran
promoters. Jim Koplik, a promoter for Cross Country Concerts in
Connecticut and upstate New York, said Etheridge sold out three
separate venues at least three weeks in advance, usually with
little advance publicity.
   ``Her Grammy performance was one of the few good Grammy
performances this year,'' he said. ``She's a tough rock 'n' roller
and there aren't too many females who are tough rock 'n' rollers
out there.''
   Etheridge admitted she practiced a Grammy acceptance speech in
her shower. She didn't win _ Tina Turner took the award in the
female rock category _ but she said she was pleasantly surprised
just to be noticed.
   ``My goals are just to get better,'' she said. ``I want to write
better. I want to sing better. I want to perform better. Success to
me is the opportunity to just keep doing what I love to do. Knowing
I've made my second album means I've been successful with my first
one.''
   The lack of instant album sales makes the current success all
the more satisfying, she said.
   ``The biggest selling point of this album was a friend telling a
friend _ word of mouth,'' Etheridge said. ``That's the way I buy
most of my music, from a friend telling me it's something good. It
takes a lot longer that way, but you can really see it multiply.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The Private Man Becomes Public</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES REINDL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ward Just's latest novel of political intrigue is
drawing critical acclaim and focusing attention on its
former-journalist author, which raises an interesting question.
   Does success mean waking up to discover one has become _ at
least partly _ the character one wrote about?
   For Just, former Newsweek and Washington Post reporter and son
of an Illinois publishing family, the answer is yes and no.
   ``All my books really have to do with people who have two lives
_ a private life and a public life,'' Just said in a recent
interview over coffee and cigarettes in a Michigan Avenue cafe. ``I
mean a public life in the way that say you and I don't have a
public life. I didn't used to have one. I guess I'm getting one now.
   ``When you are in that kind of world, half public, half private,
and the two things bear on each other, it makes the choices a
little more difficult and often a whole lot more interesting ...
than sort of ordinary people. And since we live in this world of
glaring media attention, that makes anybody who is involved in that
kind of life a very modern man.''
   ``Jack Gance'' is Just's 12th book and he is quick to point out
he is not the title character.
   The book examines the life of Chicago-born Jack Gance, son of a
successful real estate developer who winds up disgraced and jailed
in a scandal. Gance parlays his University of Chicago education and
contacts, and his accumen for deciphering the numbers of politics,
to land work in the early 1960s with the operatives in the city's
political machine.
   Gance becomes an operative himself. He moves to the White House;
new locale, same job of making things happen. The book ends with
Gance making a successful bid for the Senate from Illinois. The
private man becomes public.
   That is the background, and as Just pointed out, ``Jack Gance''
is a book about politics with a small ``p.''
   ``It's a novel with politics as its background,'' he said. ``You
know it could have just as easily been with the Army, retailing,
the news business. I just chose politics because it's a world that
interests me and I know a little bit about it, almost entirely from
my experience as a journalist.''
   The politics of ``Jack Gance'' are more the politics of people
than of parties.
   As the book explores Gance's troubled relationship with his
father and the attraction for a workaholic lawyer's wife, ``Jack
Gance'' throughout examines the motives of its central character,
looking for what propels him to make his choices.
   ``The show (politics) in Washington is very attractive to an
Illinois boy like Jack or like me,'' Just said. ``I think it is a
book maybe more about attractions than about compromise _ what
attracts people.
   ``And, I want to explore also in this country, this large
capitalist country, the nature of work _ what work does to people,
the kind of work that you have, what bearing that has on your
character and what bearing your character has on your work,'' the
author said.
   What Just finds is that compromise is more symmetrical than
defiance, that loyalty has its rewards at a price. It is laid out
in the last lines of the book when he writes that Washington ``was
a great city, always giving more than it received. It gave and gave
and gave and gave and expected nothing in return except loyalty.''
   Loyalty, Just said, is the greatest thing that can be given.
   ``To expect nothing except loyalty. Well that is expecting
everything. That is what he's given and his reward is the United
States Senate. What he gives in return is his loyalty to this
really rather appalling system.''
   Just is looking for the novel to build a more loyal readership.
Nine of his 12 books are out of print and he hopes that success
with ``Jack Gance'' will help get the books back into print.
   The gestation period for Just's books is about two years, he
said. He works from a base in Paris, where he lives with his wife,
and is planning a book about a group of Americans in Paris.
   ``I've always worked very well in foreign countries,
particularly foreign countries where I didn't speak the language,''
Just said. ``I sort of like to work on the margins like that, and
it's fun for me to be in Paris not even speaking the language very
well.
   ``It enhances something. I can't even say what.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Lacy J. Dalton Is a Survivor</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adversity has taught country singer Lacy
J. Dalton about being positive in her life.
   And her new LP, ``Survivor,'' sums it up.
   ``I am a survivor. This was a healing process,'' she said.
   ``I've learned that no matter how tough things get and how
unfairly you think you are being treated, if you get your mind off
that, if you think about your goals and feel you can attain them
... things turn around for you a lot faster.''
   Dalton began a country music career five years after her husband
died in a swimming pool accident in 1974. She was 27 and had an
infant son. Food stamps and a brief stint as a topless dancer
helped them get by.
   Determined and dedicated, she launched her career, and was voted
most promising female vocalist in 1980 by the Academy of Country
Music.
   Although she had hits with such tunes as ``16th Avenue'' and
``Hillbilly Girl With the Blues,'' her career slipped and, until
this year, she had not cut an album for three years.
   But 1989 brought an upswing. The new Universal Records signed
her and released ``Survivor.'' She's back on the country singles
charts with ``The Heart'' and ``I'm a Survivor.'' She's also
recorded a duet with Glen Campbell, ``Woodcarver.''
   And on Valentine's Day she married Aaron Anderson, her tour
manager for the past four years.
   ``I felt like a big arm had been put around me,'' she says about
her new recording contract. Still, the husky-voiced 42-year-old
performer adds, ``I'm a little scared.''
   Born Jill Byrem into a musical family in Bloomsburg, Pa.,
Dalton's songs often are about hope and strength and are frequently
aimed at women.
   ``I never sing from a negative point of view,'' she said. ``I
try to look for something to entertain or enlighten or uplift. The
underlying emphasis on everything I'm doing is to be positive.
   ``I think about women a lot. I feel that they can open doors. If
you feel you are equal, you automatically are treated that way. The
most important thing to me is if I can believe the song, if it's
real to me. Will I want to be singing this song for 20 years?''
   Despite her emphasis on looking at the bright side, she felt
compelled to quit recording for three years because of a dispute
with her former record label. It came down to a matter of
principle, with Dalton contending that her work was not being
promoted enough.
   ``Careers come and go in three years,'' she said. ``My lawyer
told me I was committing career suicide. Management went crazy and
everyone went nuts. But it was the only thing I knew to do
honorably to save the career in the long run.''
   She says Universal took a chance by offering her a contract.
   ``When you haven't been heard from in a major way for a few
years, it's like starting the career all over again,'' she said.
``A lot of people have come in since I went out. A lot of fans
don't know who I am. I am so grateful and amazed they (Universal)
would give me a home and a shelter. I hope I can be worthy.
   ``It had been a long, long time since I had a big hit. I didn't
know if anyone would be interested in signing me.''
   One of the country singers who became very successful during
Dalton's hiatus was K.T. Oslin, who has had No. 1 hit records with
candid, female-oriented songs such as ``80s Ladies'' and ``Hold
Me.''
   ``I love her work,'' Dalton said. ```80s Ladies' was one of the
best records I ever heard. When I heard it, I went `halleluiah,
praise God!' She has tremendous honesty and courage.
   ``There is so much young talent that's come in since I started
in 1979. They have fresh ideas and wonderful talent. People coming
in now are very sophisticated and very polished.''

<HEAD>Multiple Queen Discovery Means Worse Fire Ant Woes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire ant colonies with hundreds of
queens are making it harder for people to get rid of the pests than
the previously found colonies with only one queen, experts say.
   ``When a queen dies in a single-queen nest, the whole nest
dies,'' said Mike Glancy of the U.S. Agriculture Department's
Agricultural Research Service. ``But with multiple-queen mounds,
they just scatter. The workers do not have loyalty to a single
queen and will accept any queen.''
   The development also means four times as many ants, and almost
one solid ant nest, said entomologist Phil Koehler of the
University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.
   An IFAS-USDA study in Ocala found 30 to 40 fire ant mounds per
acre in the days of single queens. Now, there are 5,000 mounds per
acre _ about every 5 feet _ with 200 queens per mound.
   Multiple-queen fire ants live in greater concentrations and are
more aggressive in hunting for food than single-queen fire ants.
They have been known to attack sick people in hospital beds and the
nipples of nursing goats.
   ``This is a more aggressive insect, which means more human
contact, which means more health problems,'' Glancy said. Fire ants
also cause trouble by eating foam expansion joints in highways and
insulation in machinery.
   Queens from multiple-queen nests fly eight to 10 miles on their
mating flights, compared to a half-mile for queens from
single-queen nests.
   Multiple-queen fire ants were discovered in 1981 in Louisiana
and in Ocala and Texas in 1983. Since then, multiple queen colonies
have spread throughout Florida and are found all over the
Southeast. Koehler said that as single-queen colonies are killed
off, it clears the way for the multiple-queen nests.
   Fire ants were accidentally imported from Brazil and Argentina
in the 1920s and 1940s in the ballast of ships.

<HEAD>Scientist Puts Ties To Test As Railroads Look For New Materials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>URBANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A good railroad tie can withstand 30 years
of freight trains and snow storms, but only a few weeks with
scientist Poo Chow.
   Chow, a University of Illinois professor of wood science,
delivers a concentrated dose of Mother Nature's fury. ``We soak
them and make them swell, we dry them and make them shrink. We put
them in the freezer to simulate winter and in the oven to simulate
summer.''
   A dozen treatments produce the kind of cracking, splitting and
rotting a tie would show after 40 years on the track.
   ``We are all looking for a tie that will last longer and give us
some economic savings,'' said Don Gallery, roadway engineer for the
Illinois Central Railroad. He said Chow's research should tell
railroads how ties made from new types of woods will hold up over
long periods.
   The nation's railroads spike their steel track to more than 1
billion ties _ blocks of wood about eight inches square and eight
feet long. They transfer the weight of the trains to the roadbed
and keep the tracks at the correct angle so trains don't derail.
There is a tie every 19 inches.
   A typical tie, made of domestic wood and treated with creosote
to preserve it, lasts about 30 years depending on climate and
traffic. Evaluating new tie materials on the track is impractical
so Chow, with financial support from the Association of American
Railroads, devised a lab to simulate weathering and the effects of
squeezing, bending and movement of spikes.
   Raymond Wingard, executive director of the Railway Tie
Association in Mars, Pa., said Chow's tests will tell railroads
which ties offer the best service potential, so they can be tested
further in the field.
   Two promising woods are tough oak varieties from West Africa and
Southeast Asia, Chow said. He predicted domestic wood will continue
to be used for most ties, though the preservative may change
because of environmental concerns.

<HEAD>Women on Welfare Have Low Fertility Rate, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women on welfare have fewer children than other
women do, despite a popular impression to the contrary, a new study
suggests.
   ``The economic, social and psychological costs of becoming
pregnant and having a child while on public assistance are
perceived as clearly outweighing the benefits,'' wrote researcher
Mark Rank.
   The assistant professor of sociology at Washington University in
St. Louis presents his results in the April issue of the American
Sociological Review.
   Working from a sample of 2,796 Wisconsin households drawn
randomly from those receiving welfare benefits, Rank studied
fertility among 965 women, ages 18 to 44. He also interviewed 29
women.
   Analysis showed that for every 1,000 women in his sample, 45.8
women gave birth per year. That fertility rate is substantially
lower than the rates of 75.3 for Wisconsin women in general and
71.1 for the national population in 1980, which corresponds to the
time covered by his analysis, Rank said.
   In an interview, he said Wisconsin was a likely place to find a
potential impact from welfare because its benefits were relatively
generous. His report cautioned, however, that the study focused on
only one state.
   He also noted that the work did not address the question of
whether public assistance programs encourage women not on welfare
to have a child in order to collect benefits.
   Mary Jo Bane, a professor of public policy at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, said Rank's
study ``looks to me like a good piece of research, and the findings
seem to be plausible.''
   Bane, who has studied the impact of welfare on families, said
previous research gave no reason to believe women on welfare have
higher fertility rates. But the finding of a lower rate, at least
in Wisconsin, was a surprise, she said.

   If you live in one of the Lyme disease hot
spots, the following tips will help you recognize Lyme disease and
prevent it.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Recognizing Lyme disease:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _The first symptom in two-thirds of cases is a red rash that
develops days or weeks after a tick bite. It is often bull's-eye
shaped _ a red ring around a lighter center.
   _Those who don't get the rash get vague aches and pains and a
low-grade fever. Next comes arthritis-like pain in the joints or
nerve damage causing pain or numbness.
   _If you suspect you've been bitten by a tick, ask your doctor
for a blood test _ but wait four to six weeks. Before then, the
test shows nothing.
 
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Preventing Lyme disease:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Look for ticks after being outdoors. Lyme disease ticks are
small _ about the size of a comma in the newspaper.
   _If you find a tick, remove as much of it as you can with
tweezers or your fingers. Cover it with antiseptic. Ticks must feed
24 to 48 hours to transmit the disease, so prompt removal greatly
lowers your risk.
   _Use insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET).
   _When outdoors in high-risk areas, avoid brush when possible.
Stay on the trail.
   _Wear long pants with bottoms tucked into shoes or boots.

<HEAD>Kinder-Care To Separate Day Care, Educational Units From Financial,
Retail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kinder-Care Inc., the nation's largest
operator of day-care centers, says it will separate its day care
and education operations from its financial and retail division to
reduce its overall debt.
   A key part of the restructuring announced Monday will be the
distribution of shares of Kinder-Care Learning Centers to
Kinder-Care shareholders, said Perry Mendel, the Montgomery-based
company's chairman and founder.
   ``This separation of Kinder-Care Learning Centers, the original
company, from the financial services and specialty retail group
will help us tell working parents that we are totally focused on
child care and educational services,'' said Mendel.
   The boards of directors of Kinder-Care and Kinder-Care Learning
Centers Inc. have approved the restructuring, Mendel said.
   Under the restructuring, Kinder-Care expects to realize gross
proceeds of about $215 million, of which about $108 million will be
used to repay debt payable to Kinder-Care Learning Centers. The
remainder will be reinvested in Kinder-Care's core business
sectors, the company said.
   Richard Grassgreen, president of Kinder-Care, said that as a
result of the restructuring, he will be able to devote his full
time to financial services and specialty retailing.
   The company operates 1,235 day-care centers. In addition, it
operates 350 retail stores _ Simply 6, Bargain Town and Shoe City _
in seven Southeastern states, along with the American Savings and
Loans Association of Florida, the second-largest thrift in the
state and the 35th largest in America, and Western Reserve Life
Insurance Company, Grassgreen said.
   In connection with the restructuring, Grassgreen will not
continue in his positions with Kinder-Care Learning Centers and
Mendel no longer will be chairman and a director of Kinder-Care.
Mendel was elected chief executive officer of Kinder-Care Learning
Centers.
   The restructuring will enable Mendel to devote his full time to
child care while acting as chief executive officer until his
retirement, which is expected by Dec. 31, 1990, the company said.
   In the first step of the restructuring, Kinder-Care will offer
its shareholders the right to purchase 28 million newly issued
shares of Kinder-Care common stock at $5.75 per share.
   For each of the 54.9 million currently issued and outstanding
shares, a shareholder will be entitled to purchase .5099 shares of
Kinder-Care at $5.75 for each full share.
   Following the expiration of the rights offering, Kinder-Care
will distribute in a tax-free transaction one-half of a share of
Kinder-Care Learning Centers for each of the 82.9 million shares of
Kinder-Care to be outstanding following completion of the rights
offering.
   After the restructuring is completed, the per share book value
of Kinder Care will be approximately equal to the $5.75 exercise
price of the purchase rights.
   The company anticipates that the rights offering will be made in
July.

<HEAD>Korea's Gold Star To Produce Videotapes In U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold Star Co. will produce videotapes
at its electronics plant in Huntsville, Ala., beginning in
September, the leading South Korean electronics maker said.
   Officials said Monday that production facilities, capable of
turning out 1 million tapes a year, are being installed at the
plant, which has been in operation since 1982.
   The videotape production will fill the gap created recently when
three out of six color television production lines at the plant
were relocated to Mexico to take advantage of lower-cost labor and
parts supplies there.
   The three remaining color television production lines, capable
of assembling 500,000 sets a year, will remain at the plant,
together with microwave oven production facilities with an annual
capacity of 600,000 units, the officials said.
   They declined to say how much investment was requirement for the
videotape production project.
   The Huntsville plant is operated by a wholly owned Gold Star
subsidiary, Gold Star of America, Inc.

<HEAD>Libyan Talks With U.S. Oil Companies Deadlocked, Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks between Libya's National Oil Corp.
and five U.S. oil companies on resuming operations in the North
African country are deadlocked, the Middle East Economic Survey
reported.
   It said Monday that the negotiations, which began in Vienna last
month, are continuing, with both sides aiming for an agreement by
June 30, the deadline set by the Libyans.
   But the respected Nicosia-based oil industry newsletter noted
that the Libyans are unhappy with U.S. sanctions that ban American
technology exports to Libya and imports of Libyan oil.
   The five companies _ Marathon Oil Co., Conoco Inc., Amerada Hess
Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp. and W.R. Grace &amp; Co. _ all have
equity holdings in Libya.
   The negotiations began after the Jan.19 decision by
then-President Ronald Reagan to modify trade sanctions imposed on
Libya in 1986 because of Col. Moammar Gadhafi's alleged support for
international terrorism.
   The U.S. companies' assets in Libya were frozen when the
sanctions were imposed and the companies face seizure of the assets
by the Libyans if no agreement is reached by June 30.
   The Libyans are particularly interested in securing U.S.
expertise and technology for their oil industry amid Tripoli's
efforts to expand exploration and production.
   But they see no advantage ``in taking back the U.S. companies if
they are not allowed to import American oilfield equipment and
technological services,'' the survey reported.
   The newsletter also noted that Libya does not want to see the
Americans shipping crude to Europe, Libya's main market, if the
companies resume operations.
   The Libyans ``would like a full unconditional return by the
companies concerned, supported by a clear U.S. commitment on the
matter and freedom to ship Libyan crude to the U.S. market,'' the
survey said.
   ``However, it seems unlikely that such U.S. clearance will be
forthcoming in the near future, given that the Department of
Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control has shown no flexibility
... and Libya is not high on the agenda of President Bush's current
priorities,'' the newsletter said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were lower at midday Tuesday, as
persistent weakness in the pound continued to unnerve traders.
   However, traders said they saw little evidence of substantive
dealing.
   After a long holiday weekend in Britain, ``people are standing
back from the market at the moment and hoping to pick up on a new
theme,'' one London dealer said.
   At about 12:15 p.m. in London, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was off 10.7 points, or 0.5 percent, at
2,129.6, also its lowest point. The index started the session at
its best level of 2,139.7, off just 0.6 point.
   Volume came to a light 195.9 million shares at midday, compared
with 274.6 million shares at the same time Friday.

<HEAD>Hooker Corp. to Sell $740 Million in U.S., Australian Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>Sydney, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hooker Corp., an Australian retail and
property company, plans to sell 1 billion Australian dollars ($740
million) worth of Australian and U.S. assets to reduce debt.
   In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange on Monday,
George Herscu, Hooker's executive chairman, said the company would
sell its U.S. Merksamer Jewelers Inc. jewelry store chain, U.S.
housing interests, all Australian retailing activities, property
funds management and sand-mining and brickwork resources in
Australia.
   It will also offer for sale or joint venture a number of real
estate assets which were not disclosed.
   Herscu said that in addition to reducing debt ``significantly''
the company wanted to concentrate its efforts on its profitable
core businesses. The sales would reduce the proportion of the
company's investments in the United States where returns are
longer-term in nature, Herscu said.
   In the United States, Hooker also controls retailers B. Altman &amp;
Co., Bonwit Teller, Sakowitz and the speciality fashion chain
Parisian Inc.
   The Hooker announcement follows recent cash flow problems in its
U.S. operations that caused the company to fall behind in payments
to several apparel suppliers which halted shipments to Bonwit
Teller and Altman, analysts said.
   Herscu said some of the sales already have taken place and
others are nearly completed.
   Hooker will retain its Australian businesses in land
subdivision, housing, project development, and real estate
management. In the United States, Hooker will keep its project
development concerns, department stores and real estate brokerage
activities.

   The government oil monopoly Pemex has formed
a new international affiliate for the export of crude oils
worldwide, the company announced.
   In a statement released in Mexico City Monday, Pemex said the
new affiliate will be known as PMI Comercio Internacional, S.A. de
C.V. and will ``be charged with bringing to the world market
Mexican petroleum products ... with the goal of being more
competitive and agile.''
   The statement said the announcement was initially made in Tokyo
by company director Francisco Rojas, who is in Japan to renegotiate
a 10-year contract to continue exporting Mexican petroleum to the
Asian nation.
   Pemex exports oil to Japan through the Mexican Petroleum
Importing Co., a partnership of Pemex and Japanese industrialists.

<HEAD>PSE To Set Up Futures Market For Computer Chips, Rivaling Minneapolis
Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pacific Stock Exchange plans to file an
application with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for
permission to establish a futures market for computer chips.
   Dale Carlson, spokesman for the San Francisco-based Pacific
Stock Exchange, said Monday that the exchange also plans a cash
chip market. The application is to be submitted to the federal
agency within two weeks.
   The exchange appears to be competing with the Minneapolis-based
Twin Cities Board of Trade to set up the first chip-futures and
cash markets in the United States.
   Last week, the Twin Cities exchange said it hopes to open a cash
chip market in the fourth quarter of this year and a futures market
in 1990.
   The Pacific Stock Exchange plans to open both markets in the
first quarter of 1990, according to Carlson.
   Chip-futures trading on the PSE would involve critical computer
memory devices called DRAMs. Each contract would consist of 1,000
chips.
   A cash market would help buyers find the lowest price for chips.
The computer industry has recently experienced problems tied to
escalating chip prices.
   Calson, while saying PSE officials have not seen the Minneapolis
board's plans, said the San Francisco exchange is better suited to
chip futures trading because of its location near the nation's top
computer manufacturing area. He also cited the PSE's 100-year
history.
   ``Our location near Silicon Valley and our position as a gateway
to the Pacific Rim gives us some strategic advantages,'' said
Carlson.
   Federal law does not bar two exchanges from trading futures for
the same product, but the market has traditionally gravitated to
one exchange only.
   A buyer and seller under a futures contract agree to exchange a
given amount of a product for a set price at some time in the
future. The contracts are usually for three, six or nine months and
can be bought for little money down.
   The contracts allow buyers and sellers to hedge against future
price fluctuations because they are guaranteed a set price.

   The stock market posted modest gains in early
trading today, buoyed mainly by the dollar's strength in foreign
exchange.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.02 points to
2,497.79.
   In the broader market, about eight stocks rose for every five
that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, with 524 up, 322 down and
493 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.73 million shares.
   ``It's the strength of the dollar again that's propelling the
market,'' said Hildegarde Zagorski, a stock analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   A firmer dollar helps attract foreign money to stocks, bonds and
other investment products.
   Analysts said stocks were also helped by a drop in interest
rates in the credit markets and prospects that the Federal Reserve
will ease its credit policies to control the dollar.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.23 to 179.54. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 355.41, up 0.40.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.18 to
2,493.77, cutting its loss for the week to 7.33 points. Advancing
issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 on the NYSE, with 1,025
up, 412 down and 513 unchanged.
   The financial markets were closed Monday in observance of
Memorial Day.
   Big Board volume totaled 143.12 million shares, against 154.47
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Rig Count Up 12 to 749</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The weekly tally of oil and gas rigs operating in
the United States continued its yearlong seesaw trend with this
week's count posting a gain of 12 to total 749, according to Baker
Hughes Inc.
   Last week, the nationwide count plunged by 34. A year ago, the
count totaled 905.
   The gain this week came despite a drop of 19 rigs in Oklahoma.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Besides Oklahoma's 19-rig decline, Pennsylvania and Wyoming were
among the major oil producing states to show a rig loss, each down
one in the latest count.
   Louisiana and Michigan each gained six, while Ohio was up three,
New Mexico was up two and Kansas, North Dakota and Texas gained one
each.
   California and Colorado were unchanged.

<HEAD>Isosceles Consortium Raises Offer For Gateway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Isosceles PLC, a consortium of dissatisfied
British institutional shareholders in Gateway Corp. PLC, on Tuesday
raised its hostile bid for the British food retailer to 1.87
billion pounds ($2.9 billion).
   Gateway holders can choose between 210 pence ($3.30) in cash per
share or 195 pence ($3.06) in cash, plus at least 15 pence (24
cents) worth of stock in Isosceles.
   The new offer compares with the original cash offer of 1.7
billion pounds ($2.7 billion), or 195 pence ($3.06) per share,
which was launched on April 18.
   Isosceles, a company formed specifically to make the bid for
Gateway, said the new offer wouldn't be increased unless another
bidder for Gateway emerged.
   Gateway shares rose on the announcement, gaining 7.5 pence (12
cents) to 204.5 pence ($3.21) by midafternoon on London's Stock
Exchange. The shares had been trading above 195 pence ($3.06) in
recent trading sessions in anticipation of a higher bid.
   Isosceles is seeking to split Gateway by selling its non-food
interests and its larger stores. The consortium already has a firm
agreement to sell 62 of the larger stores to Asda Group PLC,
another British retailer, for 702 million pounds ($1.1 billion).
   The remaining Gateway interests would then be privately held by
the Isosceles consortium, which aims to float its shares on the
London Stock Exchange within the next three to five years.
   As a result, the Isosceles stock offered under the revised bid
would be unlisted, though the consortium said the shares would be
``freely transferable.''
   Isosceles said the revised offer could involve the issue of as
much as 52 percent of Isosceles' share capital. In addition, if the
bid succeeds, Isosceles plans to issue as much as 15 percent of its
stock to Gateway managers as part of a scheme of share option
incentives.

   Stock prices drifted lower in early trading
today, pulling back from a strong opening.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 2.04 to 2,491.73
at 11 a.m. EDT, after rising as much as 14 points following the
opening bell. The closely watched index ended Friday with an
11.18-point rise.
   The financial markets were closed on Monday in observance of the
Memorial Day holiday.
   In the broader market, about six stocks fell for every five that
rose on the New York Stock Exchange by late morning, with 644 down,
535 up and 552 unchanges.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 49.96 million shares by late
morning.
   Traders blamed today's downturn partly on profit-taking, noting
that the same conditions that helped push the market higher last
week were still present, including a stronger dollar and lower
interest rates in the credit markets.
   ``We had a good market before the holiday. People came back and
saw stocks up and they decided to take profits,'' said Charles
Jensen, a technical analyst with MKI Securities Corp.
   Still, some analysts expressed concern that the strong dollar
may not be ultimately good for the stock market, since it could
hurt the U.S. economy sensitive to trade.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.22 to 179.09. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 355.09, down 0.08.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybeans futures prices opened lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The market was weather-driven and contracts for old crops fared
better than the new-crop months. Weekend rains, coupled with a
five-day forecast calling for more in prime corn and soybean
growing regions, put traders on the defensive from the opening bell.
   Wheat opened lower in sympathy, but soon after establishing a
floor, both soybeans and wheat recovered slightly. Corn however
remained stuck near its early lows. A strong dollar also helped
dampen any price climbing.
   On the open, wheat was 1{ cents to 3 cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.90} a bushel; corn was 1 cent
to 5\ cents lower, with July $2.60 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to
4{ cents lower, with July at $1.66{ cents a bushel; and soybeans
were 6{ cents to 13{ cents lower, with July at $7.04{ cents a
bushel.
   Cattle future prices were mixed, but pork lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   On the open, cattle were .25 cent lower to .50 cent higher, with
June at 68.86 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to
.05 cent higher, with August at 77.12 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .30 cent lower a pound; and frozen pork bellies were
.37 cent to .52 cent lower, with July at 30.55 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. announced today it has secured bank
financing for its proposed $3.6 billion bid for NWA Inc., the
parent of Northwest Airlines and the target of a bidding contest.
   In an announcement, Pan Am stated it has received commitments
from five banks: Bankers Trust Co., Citibank, First National Bank
of Chicago, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and Security Pacific National
Bank.
   Pan Am declined to specify the amount of the banks' commitments.
Sources close to the company, however, said it exceeded the $1.6
billion which Pan Am said last week it was seeking.
   ``These commitments, together with the equity commitment of at
least $400 million from Prudential-Bache and the Airlie Group, will
enable Pan Am to put forward a very attractive offer to the
shareholders of NWA,'' Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett said in the
statement.
   Northwest public relations spokesman Bob Gibbons said today the
airline would have no immediate comment on the Pan Am announcement.
   NWA, meanwhile, prepared to open bids from suitors for the
company. NWA had set a 3 p.m. CDT deadline today for takeover
offers and said last week that it planned on a single round of
bidding. The NWA board of directors, however, could decide not to
accept any of the bids and some analysts say the process could
start over if a higher bid came in later.
   Sources close to Pan Am said the company planned to submit its
takeover proposal to NWA by the deadline.
   Once the bids are in, a committee of four outside directors must
scrutinize each offer, a complex financial proposal that must
include not just a price per share but a host of details about who
is providing equity or loans, how much and in what form, as well as
the purchaser's plans for NWA once it is bought.
   An NWA spokesman has said the board may issue a decision by the
end of June.
   Other likely bidders for NWA include oil billionaire Marvin
Davis, whose first offer of $2.72 billion was rejected, and an
investment group led by financier Al Checchi.
   After Davis made his bid, the NWA board said it would explore
restructuring alternatives. The board said last Thursday it had
appointed a special committee to oversee that process.
   Possible alternatives include acquisition of another company, a
partial or complete liquidation of the airline, a repurchase of
shares, a special dividend or a sale of equity to third parties.
   Plaskett has said he is not contemplating layoffs of union
employees at Northwest, which is much larger than Pan Am.
Cooperation from Northwest's unions is considered crucial to the
bid.
   Industry analysts have been cautious about Pan Am's prospects
because of its $900 million in debt, $535 million in outstanding
pension liabilities and continuing losses.
   In a meeting last week with investment fund managers, Plaskett
outlined plans for Pan Am's bid, which would include the sale of
high-yield notes and bank financing for the $3.6 billion package.
   He said the offer would be all cash and fully financed.
   Plaskett told investors he plans no sales of operating assets
and no sale or lease-back of existing planes.
   He said he is not assuming any revenue from a sale of
Northwest's Japanese real estate, but expects to save $240 million
by streamlining the new carrier's corporate headquarters, marketing
operation, maintenance and other support services.

   Reed International has signed a definitive
agreement for its previously-announced $825 million purchase of the
Travel Information Group, a travel and electronic publishing
business from News Corp., the companies said Tuesday.
   The deal still must be approved by regulators in the United
Kingdom and by Reed's stockholders, who are expected to vote in
late June.
   News Corp., the Australian-based company run by Rupert Murdoch,
and the British-based Reed had announced May 5 that they had signed
a letter of intent for the transaction.
   The group publishes business information for the travel
industry, including such reference works as the Hotel &amp; Travel
Index, Official Meeting Facilities Guide, World Travel Directory
and the newspaper Travel Weekly.
   It also operates an electronic travel and information service
including the Utell International hotel reservation system and
Ultraswitch, a cooperative venture with the world's largest hotel
chains that handles hotel, airline and other computer reservations.

<HEAD>Regulations, Good and Bad, Add to Housing Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In perhaps no other industry must the producer
obtain permission from regulators for each individual unit of
production. Housing, in other words, is a very highly regulated
industry.
   Housing is also expensive. For most people it is the most costly
item of a lifetime. For young couples it is the biggest financial
hurdle of their lives. Regulations have a lot to do with that
situation.
   Could something be done to lower such costs, such as reducing
regulations?
   Certainly. Regulations that proliferate at the local level could
be thinned out. Will it be done? Probably not, or if so, only by
bits and pieces.
   Previous attempts, at least, have always met with frustration.
There are good and necessary regulations and poor and undesirable
regulations, and no way to separate the two types without endless
battles in thousands of communities.
   Still, the idea of less regulation is always on the minds of
builders and their representatives for a simple reason: Any price
cut can be translated into more sales and bigger profits, to say
nothing about making housing affordable.
   Seeking to determine what savings might result from a relaxation
of local regulations, the Joint Venture for Affordable Housing, a
program involving the industry and state and local officials,
conducted demonstration projects.
   Reviewing the results, the experimenters concluded that the
average savings per unit in land and construction cost was $8,573,
with the range of savings differing markedly from place to place.
   In Portland, Ore., for example, unit savings amounted to $15,647
for homes in a price range of $50,000 to $55,000. In Elkhart City,
Ind., the savings amounted to only $855 on a home priced to sell
between $37,500 to $54,920.
   In general, according to the National Association of Home
Builders, the savings were found in four categories:
   Land use regulations, mainly about density; development
standards, such as road width, sewers and sidewalks; construction
methods, such as in allowing new materials and wider spacing of
studs; and streamlined paper processing.
   Most of the savings in the first category were a result of
allowing more units to be built on the same amount of land,
reducing not only the land cost per unit but the cost per lot for
streets and sidewalks.
   In some instances, local agencies may insist on questionable
development practices, such as requiring suburban residential
streets to meet the same standards as urban thoroughfares, with
square curbs and wide sidewalks.
   Do such requirements serve the neighborhood? Perhaps, but maybe
not. Wide streets, for example, may encourage more through traffic
and higher speeds, raising the danger to children playing in the
neighborhood.
   While most localities base their local codes on national models,
they often exercize their right to add amendments or adopt only
parts that suit them. There could also be a bias against
innovations in materials and techniques.
   The Home Builders report also suggests that economic interests
and social preferences of existing residents often favor
limitations to growth, sometimes limiting new construction to very
expensive homes.
   In fact, it suggests, some local regulations wouldn't stand up
in court, but it concedes that the fact they are illegal doesn't
mean they are not present and effective.
   Obviously, however, most local regulations are necessary and
beneficial for all parties involved. In the absence of regulations,
chaotic competition would develop among builders, hurting them, the
buyers and the communities.
   If there is an answer to the regulatory problem nobody has yet
stumbled on it. It is an all-American problem, snarled in the
grass-roots peculiarities of 9,000 local agencies. It is democracy
at its best and worst.

   Fiat said Tuesday its consolidated net earnings rose
28 percent to a record in 1988 as its sales rose 15.3 percent.
   Fiat, Italy's largest private industrial group, said its
earnings rose to 3.026 trillion lire, or about $2.86 billion, in
1988, compared with 2.373 trillion lire a year earlier.
   On a per share basis, net profit rose to 1,293 lire, or 89
cents, from 1,014 a year earlier.
   It said its revenue rose to 44.308 trillion lire, or $30.56
billion, last year from 38.435 trillion lire in 1987.
   The company called the results ``extremely positive'' and said
all but one of the group's 14 divisions turned in a net profit last
year. The company's aviation division showed a loss.
   Fiat's board of directors, chaired by Giovanni Agnelli, proposed
raising dividend payouts by 50 lire, or 3.4 cents, to 320 lire, or
22 cents, for each common and preferred share and to 350 lire, or
24 cents, for each savings share.
   It also proposed a stock repurchase program of up to 1 trillion
lire, or about $690 million, in all three categories of stock. The
specific terms and method will be determined at the June 30
shareholders meeting, Fiat said.

   Stock prices headed lower in choppy trading
today amid concerns about the effects of a strong dollar on the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 11.05 to
2,482.72 at 2 p.m. EDT, after rising as much as 14 points following
the opening bell. The closely watched index ended Friday with an
11.18-point rise.
   The financial markets were closed on Monday in observance of the
Memorial Day holiday.
   In the broader market, three stocks declined for every two that
rose on the New York Stock Exchange, with 848 down, 549 up and 512
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 102.78 million shares with two
hours to go.
   Stock prices started out strong due largely to lower interest
rates in the credit markets, but they declined later in the session
on profit-taking and worries about the dollar, analysts said.
   ``The principal concern is that further increases in the dollar
might start to cloud the economic outlook,'' said Hugh Johnson,
senior vice president for First Albany Corp.
   Investors are particularly concerned about whether the strong
rise in the dollar's value in recent weeks could hurt the U.S.
economy sensitive to trade.
   Among the most actively traded blue-chip stocks, Texaco was up {
to 51{; American Telephone and Telegraph was down [ to 35|; and
International Business Machines was down 1} to 107}.
   NWA was up ~ to 106~. NWA has set today as the deadline for
possible bidders to submit their offers for the company.
   Time was up 3[ to 135[ amid continued speculation that another
bidder could emerge and derail a proposed merger with Warner
Communcations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.84 to 178.47. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 354.49, down 0.52.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose to a two-year high against
the British pound but was mixed against most other major currencies
Tuesday in European trading as Japan moved to raise its interest
rates.
   Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said the dollar shrugged off concerted dollar-selling by
central banks and the Bank of Japan's decision to raise its
official discount rate on Wednesday to 3.25 percent from 2.5
percent.
   Dealers said traders speculated that the West German central
bank would follow suit by raising its discount rate of 4.5 percent
at a council meeting on Thursday.
   ``The market sentiment remains positive on the dollar despite
all this talk of higher German rates,'' said Karl-Heinz Elsen, a
senior foreign exchange dealer at Chemical Bank AG in Frankfurt,
West Germany.
   The British pound appeared to bear the brunt of the
interest-rate hikes, slumping to a 25-month low against the dollar.
   British banks raised their base lending rates last week to a
four-year high of 14 percent, partly to support the sliding pound.
Sterling fell to $1.5570 from $1.5710 late Monday.
   Dealers said trading remained thin after Monday's holidays in
the United States and Britain.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.22 Japanese yen to a closing 143.10
yen. Later, in London, it rose further to 143.25 yen.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late rates on Monday,
included: 2.0100 West German marks, down from 2.0101; 1.7545 Swiss
francs, down from 1.7550; 6.8085 French francs, up from 6.8025;
2.2630 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2625; 1,452.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,454.00, and 1.2055 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2047.
   Gold bullion fell in London to a late bid of $362.25 a troy
ounce, down from $363.75 late last Friday. London markets were
closed on Monday.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to $362.10 an ounce from $363.35 bid
late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 43 cents an ounce to $362.73.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.20 a troy
ounce, down from $5.27 bd late Friday.

<TEXT>
   Most grain and soybean futures prices closed
lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts said a strong U.S. dollar and expectations for more of
the wet weather that touched key growing areas over the recent
three-day holiday weekend affected prices.
   Traders, coming off last week's life-of-contract lows, began the
day on the defensive after weekend rain was reported in both corn
and soybean regions, and wheat opened lower in sympathy.
   In general, the closer to delivery a contract was in each of the
three markets, the better it fared. Only July soybeans managed to
close with a gain.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 3{ cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.91{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
to 6{ cents lower, with July at $2.61} a bushel; oats were 3{ cents
to 4} cents lower, with July at $1.65\ cents a bushel; and soybeans
were 7 cents higher to 19 cents lower, with July at $7.18 a bushel.
 Europe.
   ``I think it's a good thing,'' the president said. ``It's good
for NATO. I happen to think it's good for the entire free world.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the summit paved the way
for ``a historic chance for realistic and significant arms control
progress.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Kohl's main European
antagonist in the missile flap, said she was ``very, very
satisfied'' with the agreement on short-range missiles. It was, she
said, a ``pretty tight document.''
   French President Francois Mitterrand described the meeting's
results as ``very positive.'' And Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime
minister, said, ``European unity is reaffirmed.''
   The Germans entered the summit demanding immediate negotiations
with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to reduce short-range nuclear
missiles in Europe.
   U.S. and British officials said attention should be focused
first on slashing the East's enormous superiority in conventional
arms in newly opened talks in Vienna between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact.
   They also worried that entering into those negotiations would
inevitably lead to outright elimination of the missiles, known in
military jargon as the ``third zero.'' NATO contends it needs a
nuclear arsenal to offset the East's massive conventional force.
   After discussions lasting until early Tuesday, NATO foreign
ministers fashioned a compromise.
   The allies said they would ``make every effort'' to bring the
Vienna talks ``to an early and satisfactory conclusion,'' possibly
within six months to a year.
   Once implementation of such an accord has begun, the United
States ``is prepared to enter into negotiations to achieve a
partial reduction'' of short-range nuclear missiles to equal
levels. The word ``partial'' was underlined.
   ``There will be no `third zero.' Partial means partial,'' Bush
insisted at a news conference.
   The leaders also said reductions in short-range missiles ``will
not be carried out until the results of these (conventional)
negotiations have been implemented.''
   They agreed that the troublesome question of deploying a new,
more powerful generation of surface-to-surface nuclear missiles
``will be dealt with in 1992 in the light of overall security
developments.''
   They said they ``recognize the value'' of the American effort to
develop a replacement to the aging Lance missile. The weapon was
introduced in 1972, and military analysts say it will become
obsolete in 1995.
   The United States wanted a strong endorsement from the allies
for its development program. Kohl, worried about the survival of
his center-right government, wanted to delay a decision on
production of the missile until after important elections next year
in Germany.
   The leaders reaffirmed that their strategy for deterrence was
based on a mix of ``adequate and effective nuclear and conventional
forces.''
   ``Where nuclear forces are concerned, land-, sea- and air-based
systems, including ground-based missiles, in the present
circumstances and as far as can be foreseen will be needed in
Europe,'' they said.
   Overshadowed by the arms control push was a set of guidelines
for encouraging the enormous changes under way in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe.
   ``We welcome the current reforms that have already led to
greater openness, improved respect for human rights, active
participation of the individual, and new attitudes in foreign
policy,'' the leaders said in a separate statement. ``But much
remains to be done.''
   They called on the East to tear down the physical and political
walls separating Europeans, simplify border crossings and allow the
free movement of people and information.
   The NATO allies said they will try to increase contacts among
individuals in the East and West and seek more economic and trade
ties.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stakes are a lot higher than they were in the
days of Sutter's Mill or the Klondike Rush, but gold fever still
drew hundreds to an international gold show that began Tuesday.
   Anyone expecting the grizzled prospectors of yore might be
disappointed, though, to find that modern-day ``goldbugs'' often
dress in pin-striped suits and care more about geophysics and
electromagnetics than grubhoes and hammers.
   Despite their formal appearance, however, many of the mining
company officials at the exposition said that those who devote
their lives to the pursuit of gold are still a breed apart.
   ``You're like a detective, unraveling the secrets of Mother
Nature,'' said Robert S. Middleton, president of Tarzan Gold Inc.,
which mines gold and mineral deposits in Canada. ``But the old guys
are kind of being phased out. They're being replaced by unemployed
geologists.''
   Gold miners from companies with names like Galactic Resources
Inc., Pegasus Gold and Rayrock Yellowknife swapped tales of
high-tech mining practices like ``induced polarization.'' They also
attended lectures on such diverse topics as ``How to Develop a
Mine'' and ``Platinum: Star of the Metals Market.''
   But Middleton and others who staked their claims behind display
booths at the Boston Gold Show were on the lookout for investors in
what has been a lean period for gold.
   The price of gold has been down for three years after a boom
period. On Tuesday, it hovered near $363 an ounce on world markets.
As a result, said some gold analysts at the exposition, many
smaller companies that deal in precious metals are in precarious
financial health while the approximately 20 major companies have
been expanding.
   Gold may be in more of a bear market but the spirits of mining
company officials Tuesday were still upbeat.
   ``We're risk-takers, optimistic people,'' said Robert Dickinson,
president of Continental Gold Corp. which discovered a major
deposit outside Vancouver, British Columbia, in November 1988 that
has so far yielded 4 million ounces of gold.
   For some perspective, South Africa, the world's largest producer
of gold, produced about 60 million of ounces last year, according
to industry officials. The Soviet Union is the world's
second-largest producer, followed by Canada. The United States and
Australia are tied for fourth place, officials said.
   Dickinson said most of the miners and investors who attend
expositions like the Gold Show consider themselves ``goldbugs.''
   ``A goldbug is a person who believes that because of all the
problems in the world that an investment in gold is a protection
against collapse and the foundation of all money,'' said Dickinson.
``But it's also someone who has gold fever.''
   These days, high technology has made mining for gold far more
sophisticated than what took place during the gold rushes in
Northern California in 1849 or in the Yukon Territory in 1898.
   But much of the work that goes into finding a new vein is still
backbreaking labor, and surprisingly primitive.
   ``The actual staking of the claim is pretty barbaric,'' said
Douglas Martin, a miner and geologist with Tarzan Gold.
   As Martin as others explained it, modern prospectors begin to
scout possible locations by using government maps of areas near
known gold fields. Then they ``walk the bush'' in chosen areas
using simple tools to clear away brush and scrape rock outcroppings.
   Once they have found a likely location, they use what they call
``airborne geophysical instruments'' mounted in aircraft to measure
electromagnetic fields that may signal the presence of precious
metals in the bush below.
   If the sensors pick up evidence of gold, the miners return to
the ground. They stake out their claim by walking a 40-acre site
and placing a post in four corners that are each 1,320 feet apart.
After they receive mineral rights to the spot, they go in with
backhoes and bulldozers and drill for gold.
   And when they strike gold, the feeling is timeless, the miners
said.
   ``It's really a thrill,'' said Middleton, who still remembers
the dimension of a major deposit in gold he found after drilling
one hole in Ontario: It was ``98 feet of .256 ounces of gold,'' he
said.

   Gail Gentry, whose lower back was crushed when
a mine roof caved in 11 years ago, pushed his wheelchair in front
of a caravan of massive coal trucks and held a sign saying,
``Pittston Stole My Health Card.''
   ``I'm taking a stand against an immoral company and against an
immoral act,'' the 42-year-old miner said last week, just before he
became the 2,000th person arrested in the United Mine Workers'
strike against Pittston Coal Group.
   Such non-violent tactics have won the union public sympathy, but
little movement at the bargaining table. With the strike involving
nearly 1,700 miners entering its eighth week and federally mediated
negotiations set to resume Wednesday, officials of the union and
the company, Virginia's largest coal producer, say they are
prepared for a lengthy battle.
   ``This thing is a long way from being over,'' UMW strike
coordinator Marty Hudson said.
   Morale, though, remains high among the striking miners who dress
uniformly in camouflage and head every day to the coal fields,
located in Virginia's southwestern tip.
   Miners have brought their wives and children along and the
atmosphere on the main picket line is festive at times.
   During a recent demonstration, a few dozen picketers, with a
banjo and mandolin setting the pace for flatfoot dancers, joined in
a stanza criticizing the company's withdrawal of some health
benefits from their modified tune of ``Oh, Susannah.''
   The music stopped when a handful of burly miners and their wives
sat down in the road to block a caravan of coal trucks from
entering Pittston's processing plant.
   As state troopers arrested the demonstrators, the crowd sang
``We Shall Overcome.''
   On Wednesday, a dozen priests, nuns and church activists were
arrested in sit-down demonstrations.
   The miners went on strike April 5 after working 14 months
without a contract. They claim the company, which refused to go
along with an industrywide UMW agreement, is trying to break the
union by reducing job security and setting up an independent
pension fund.
   Pittston officials say they want to maintain a union shop, but
under its own rules to provide labor flexibility, such as increased
subcontracting and seven-day work weeks, to meet growing
competition from non-union and foreign companies.
   Both sides say the outcome of the strike could affect future
contract negotiations throughout the coal industry.
   Negotiators from both sides are scheduled to meet with
representatives of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service
Wednesday after taking a break last week.
   Union officials and industry analysts say there is little chance
the federal mediators will reach a settlement, in part because they
are not empowered to arbitrate a binding agreement.
   ``If we're going to win this strike, we're going to win it right
here,'' Hudson said, gesturing to the crowd of several hundred
picketers.
   Pittston President Michael Odom, referring to the industrywide
contract negotiated by the Bituminous Coal Operators Association,
said the union is ``dead set on cramming that BCOA agreement down
our throats.
   ``We're not going to take it. If the union's going to stick to
that position, we're going to be here a long time,'' Odom said from
his office in Lebanon.
   Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin fined the union
$650,000 earlier this month for vandalism and for breaking his
rules against mass picketing and blocking coal trucks. He said the
union will face daily fines ranging from $20,000 to $100,000 if the
tactics continue.
   A federal judge is scheduled to decide Thursday whether to issue
his own restrictions on strike activities based on a complaint
filed by the National Labor Relations Board, which accused the
union of unfair labor practices.
   Only one confrontation between strikers and drivers hired by
Pittston has resulted in injuries. Seven miners and two drivers
were injured when miners pelted the trucks with rocks and the
drivers plowed into demonstrators.
   Hudson said heavy fines will hurt the union, but will not stop
the civil disobedience.
   ``The company and the judge say this is an economic struggle,
but to me it's a moral fight that goes to the heart of the people,
to preserving a way of life,'' he said. ``You make a decision that
you're right and you don't back down.''

   Stock prices declined broadly today following a
wave of computerized program selling late in the session.
   Analysts said today's selloff was expected as investors
re-evaluated the direction of the market after its sharp runup of
recent weeks.
   ``The fever in the market was picking up,'' said Alfred Goldman,
a vice president for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. ``But its rosy cheeks
may not be the glow of health.''
   Stock prices started out stronger today due largely to lower
interest rates in the credit markets.
   But analysts said a change in the direction of rates,
profit-taking and worries about the long-term effects of a rising
dollar on the economy took their toll on the market.
   Investors are particularly concerned about whether the dollar's
strength in foreign exchange, which continued today, could hurt the
U.S. economy sensitive to trade.
   ``The stock market is not responding to the stronger dollar and
good bond market the way it did in prior weeks,'' said Hugh
Johnson, senior vice president for First Albany Corp.
   Facilitating the market's decline was a rash of selling by
professional traders engaged in computer-program strategies
involving options and futures on stock indexes, analysts said.

   The stock market fell broadly in choppy trading
Tuesday as a wave of computerized program selling overwhelmed
buyers returning from the long Memorial Day weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended down 18.22 points
to 2,475.55 _ its biggest one-day loss in a week _ after
fluctuating throughout the session.
   The closely watched index, which closed up 11 points on Friday,
had risen nearly 17 points after the opening bell Tuesday and was
off as much as 35 points in late afternoon.
   In the broader market, about five stocks declined for every
three that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, with 917 down, 559
up and 490 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 151.78 million shares, up
slightly from 143.12 million Friday.
   The financial markets were closed on Monday in observance of
Memorial Day.
   Some analysts said Tuesday's selloff was expected as investors
re-evaluated the direction of the market after its sharp runup of
recent weeks.
   ``The fever in the market was picking up,'' said Alfred Goldman,
a vice president for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. ``But its rosy cheeks

   Facilitating the market's decline was a rash of selling by

International Business Machines was down 1\ to 108\; and General

   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 180.21 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell

   The dollar slipped below 2 West German marks in
late trading Tuesday in a choppy session dominated by speculation
about an interest-rate increase by the West German central bank.
   The dollar finished the day above the levels in reached last
Friday in New York but below where it traded Monday in Europe. The
U.S. and British currency markets were closed for holidays on
Monday.
   Last week the dollar rose above 2 marks for the first time in 2{
years and went over 140 Japanese yen for the first time in 1{ years.
   Trading Tuesday was dominated by speculators known as
``jobbers'' who try to cash in on short-term price trends while
ignoring fundamental factors, said Carmine Rotondo, chief corporate
dealer in the New York office of Security Pacific National Bank.
   With speculation causing sharp ups and downs, ``The market looks
like an EKG,'' or electrocardiogram, Rotondo said.
   In an early show of strength, the dollar shrugged off the Bank
of Japan's decision to raise its official discount rate on
Wednesday to 3.25 percent from 2.5 percent.
   The daily highs were reached in Asian trading, when the dollar
at one point went over 2.02 West German marks and touched 144
Japanese yen.
   Dollar sales by European central banks did little to knock down
the dollar, which reached a two-year high against the British pound
in European trading.
   But later in New York, the dollar was hurt by speculation that
West Germany's Bundesbank would decide at its weekly council
meeting on Thursday to raise base lending rates, which would make
the mark more attractive.
   Also weakening the dollar late in the session was intervention
by the Federal Reserve, which sold dollars when the currency
already was sliding.
   Higher interest rates in Japan and West Germany would tend to
weaken the dollar by making yields in their currencies more
attractive in comparison to yields on U.S. investments such as
Treasury bills.
   The British pound appeared to bear the brunt of the
interest-rate hikes. Many traders moved money from sterling into
marks, said Bruce Brittain, managing director for foreign-exchange
trading at Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Sterling fell in London to $1.5570 from $1.5710 late Monday.
Later in New York, sterling traded at $1.5710, up from its London
level but down from $1.5905 late Friday in New York.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.22 Japanese yen to a closing 143.10
yen. Later in London, the dollar rose to 143.25 yen. In New York,
the dollar traded at 142.75 yen, down from earlier in the trading
day but up from 141.10 yen on Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates on
Friday, included: 1.9960 marks, up from 1.9835; 1.7345 Swiss
francs, up from 1.7310; 1.2075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2015;
6.7635 French francs, up from 6.7170; and 1,440 Italian lire, up
from 1,433.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates on
Monday, included: 2.0100 West German marks, down from 2.0101;
1.7545 Swiss francs, down from 1.7550; 6.8085 French francs, up
from 6.8025; 2.2630 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2625; 1,452.50
Italian lire, down from 1,454.00, and 1.2055 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.2047.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell 43 cents an ounce to $362.73 a troy
ounce.
   Gold bullion fell in London to a late bid of $362.25 a troy
ounce, down from $363.75 late last Friday. London markets were
closed on Monday. In Zurich, gold fell to $362.10 an ounce from
$363.35 bid late Monday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $365.70 a troy ounce from $366 on Friday.
   Later, Republic National of New York said gold was bid at
$364.45 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $363.75 an ounce late
Friday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.20 a troy
ounce, down from $5.27 bid late Friday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $5.23 a troy ounce from $5.252
late Friday.

   Japan's central bank announced Tuesday it will
raise its official discount rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3.25
percent, in the first increase in the key rate in almost a decade.
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said the decision to raise
the rate effective Wednesday resulted from the bank's desire to
stem inflation and strengthen the yen, which has fallen against the
U.S. dollar in recent months.
   Commercial bank interest rates will rise in mid-June, officials
said.
   Sumita told a news conference that the rate hike was a
``precaution'' to stem inflationary threats and stabilize prices.
   The discount rate, the interest rate the central bank charges
commercial banks, has stood at 2.5 percent _ the lowest level of
any industrialized nation _ since February 1987.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama called the bank's decision ``a
timely measure'' and said Japan should continue to watch prices,
``especially the effects of the lower yen exchange rate and higher
oil prices.''
   Eishiro Saito, chairman of the powerful Japan Federation of
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said the rate hike was
unnecessary but perhaps unavoidable ``because of the need to
stabilize exchange rates and maintain coordination with other
countries.''
   The long-term prime lending rate is expected to rise by 0.20 to
0.30 percentage points in late June, analysts say.
   Rates on Japan's overseas loans may rise as well, although
low-interest development loans are less likely to be affected, said
a Bank of Japan official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hirokazu Yoshida of Sanwa Bank said the increase would have
little impact on currency trading because the market had been well
prepared by media speculation about the rise.
   ``Even when the speculation first began, it didn't give much of
a psychological boost to the yen,'' he said. ``If it didn't work
then, it won't work now.''
   Finance Minister Murayama said hikes in commercial bank interest
rates would go into effect June 19.
   Money in regular savings account will earn 0.38 percent interest
per year, up from 0.26 percent, he said.
   In recent years the Bank of Japan has followed a policy of
low-interest rates to encourage economic growth and slow the
earlier rapid appreciation of the yen.
   The discount rate peaked at 9.0 percent in 1980 in an attempt by
thebank to halt skyrocketing consumer prices during an inflationary
wave.
   Since then, the bank consistently lowered the rate until the
decision on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   LTV Steel Co. said Tuesday that parent company
LTV Corp. has agreed to sell its bar division as part of an
employee stock ownership plan.
   The presidents of United Steelworkers union locals in the steel
division last week voted 5-3 for the plan. One local president was
not at the vote.
   About 4,700 salaried, hourly or senior management employees in
the bar division initially will work for the new company, which is
expected to produce about 1.2 million tons of steel annually.
   Details of the stock ownership plan, including its total value,
were not revealed.
   The division makes continuously cast and ingot-poured billets
for hot rolling mills in Canton and Massillon, Ohio, and Chicago.
   The Canton plant also provides steel to cold-finished bar plants
in Massillon; Gary, Ind.; Willimantic, Conn., Beaver Falls, Pa.;
and a plant in Canton that makes alloy steels for aerospace and
defense applications.
   The deal is subject to a rank-and-file vote of about 4,000
Steelworkers in the division and approval of a federal bankruptcy
judge in Dallas-based LTV's Chapter 11 reorganization.
   Officials said they hope the deal can be completed by June 30.
   The sale completes divestiture of steel operations that
Cleveland-based LTV Steel had sought in its plan to emerge from
reorganization as a smaller company concentrating on flat-rolled
and tubular products, LTV Corp. Chairman Raymond A. Hay said in a
statement.
   Russell W. Maier, president of the Canton-based bar division,
will be chief executive of the new company, to be known as Republic
Engineered Steels Inc.
   He said the name honors the former Republic Steel Co., which was
part of a 1984 merger that created LTV Steel.
   Maier said the division is profitable but needs at least $400
million in capital improvements to stay competitive.
   Joseph Coyle, Canton's USW District 27 director, said
Steelworkers would transfer about $4,000 worth of LTV stock each
into the new venture, for a total of about $17.6 million, with
other contributions coming from management.

<TEXT>
   A partnership of Quantum Chemical Corp. and the
investment firm First Boston Inc. has agreed to buy the Petrolane
propane gas business from Panhandle Eastern Corp. and public
shareholders in a deal valued at $1.18 billion, it was announced
Tuesday.
   QFB Partners, the newly formed combination, will pay $450
million to Panhandle Eastern for Petrolane Inc., which consists of
a 44 percent interest in Petrolane Partners L.P. and a 100 percent
interest in a company that owns and leases propane tanks to the
partnership.
   In addition, it will spend $394.5 million for the 56 percent of
Petrolane Partners that is owned by public shareholders. It also
will take on $335 million in Petrolane debt.
   To acquire the portion owned by the public, QFB will begin
immediately a cash tender offer for the 13.15 million partnership
units of Petrolane owned by the public at $30 a share.
   On the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, the stock rose $2.87{ to
close at $29.62{ a share.
   Quantum spokesman Richard A. Tilghman said the debt would
probably be refinanced.
   The agreement is subject to approval by antitrust regulators.
   Panhandle Eastern acquired Petrolane as part of its purchase
earlier this year of Texas Eastern Corp. Houston-based Panhandle
sold Petrolane to reduce its own debt.
   New York-based Quantum, whose main product is polyethylene,
recently undertook a partial recapitalization that left it with
$2.1 billion in debt. The joint venture with First Boston will
reduce the size of its investment and keep the new debt off its
books.
   Quantum until January 1988 was known as National Distillers
Corp. In 1987, it sold its liquor assets and bought Enron Corp.'s
polyethylene business. Its 1988 revenue totaled $3 billion.
   First Boston plans to make a $1 billion loan to finance the
purchase temporarily. The two companies each will put up $100
million for their share of the equity.
   Quantum's Suburban Propane Division will manage the Petrolane
propane business for QFB under a management agreement. Also under
the deal, Quantum can buy out First Boston's interest in five years.

<HEAD>Court To Consider Reviving Lawsuit Against Maryland S&amp;L</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to
consider reviving a federal lawsuit stemming from the collapse of
Old Court Savings &amp; Loan Association in Maryland.
   The court said it will review a ruling that barred depositors
from using a federal anti-racketeering law to sue Old Court's
former owners and others.
   Old Court's collapse helped trigger a savings and loan crisis in
Maryland in 1985 and led to the criminal convictions of former
owners Jeffrey Levitt, Jerome Cardin and Allan Pearlstein.
   Levitt was sentenced to 30 years for stealing $14.7 million from
the thrift institution; Cardin 15 years for stealing $385,000;
Pearlstein eight years for stealing $640,786.
   Civil suits seeking hundreds of millions of dollars were filed
against the owners in federal and state courts. There have been
multi-million-dollar settlements of some of the state claims.
   Old Court owners and the others _ including a law firm and
accounting firm that worked for the institution _ were accused in
the suits of the largest financial fraud in Maryland's history.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last January upheld
dismissal of the federal suit.
   The appeals court rejected depositors' arguments that
certificates of deposit issued by Old Court were securities _ as
defined by the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
   The appeals court relied upon a 1982 Supreme Court ruling that
said a long-term certificate issued by a federally insured bank is
not a security within the meaning of the 1934 law.
   The 4th Circuit court said the 1982 ruling means ``the existence
of a comprehensive regulatory and insurance system governing the
issuer removes certificates of deposit issued by it from the
general definition of securities.''
   Maryland had such a regulatory system, the appeals court said,
even though it failed to protect Old Court's depositors.
   The appeals court also said that the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act does not provide an
automatic basis for a federal lawsuit against Old Court. The lower
court said since the Old Court owners and others were sued in state
court for violating the anti-racketeering law, the federal courts
properly may decide to step aside.
   The justices today limited their review to the 4th Circuit
court's dismissal of the RICO allegations.
   The case is Tafflin vs. Levitt, 88-1650.

<HEAD>Cocoa Prices Plummet After Ivory Coast Announces Significant Cuts</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 13th graf, `Precious metals ...,' to CORRECT price of platinum
by fixing misplaced decimial point.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices plunged Tuesday following a report that the
Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, will cut by almost
40 percent the prices it pays farmers for the crop.
   The strong U.S. dollar, which also contributed to the drop in
cocoa futures, helped depress grain and soybean futures and
contributed to a mixed performance by precious metal futures.
   On other markets, frozen pork bellies turned sharply lower
because of rising inventories and petroleum futures were mixed.
   The July cocoa contract on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange settled $79 lower at $1,141 a ton, with deferred months
showed drops ranging from $26 to $49 a ton.
   ``Cocoa may have ended off the day's lows only because of some
late short-covering,'' said Kim Badenhop of Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc. in New York. ``It was plummeting for a while.''
   According to projections, Ivory Coast will sell an estimated
685,000 tons of cocoa this year, compared with 385,000 tons for
Brazil, the world's No. 2 marketer, and its producers already are
the highest-paid in Africa.
   Analysts had been anticipating that Ivory Coast President
Houphouet-Boigny would announce a cut in the producer prices soon
to save government funds and ease overproduction.
   Reports that Houphouet-Boigny would announce the cuts _ from
about $1,190 per ton to $744 _ later this week apparently
originated with remarks to that effect by a World Bank official
Tuesday in Washington.
   The U.S. dollar's continued rally in foreign exchange helped
nudge prices lower because significant amounts of cocoa are bought
and sold on the London Mercantile Exchange and the dollar improved
its position relative to the British pound.
   The stronger dollar _ which makes U.S. exports more expensive _
helped depress the grain markets on the Chicago Board of Trade,
although the principal market feature was weather, analysts said.
Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower nearly across the
board.
   Traders said wet weather that touched key growing areas over the
three-day holiday weekend and forecasts calling for more of the
same helped push prices lower.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents lower to 1 cent higher, with July at
$3.91 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 6{ cents lower, with July at
$2.61} a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 4} cents lower, with July at
$1.65\ cents a bushel; and soybeans were 6 cents higher to 19 cents
lower, with July at $7.18 a bushel.
   Precious metals futures were mixed. Gold was 20 cents lower to
$1.50 higher on the Comex, with June at $365.70 a troy ounce;
silver was 2.5 cents to 3.4 cents lower, with June at $5.23 a troy
ounce. Platinum, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, was
$1.40 to $1.90 higher, with July at $509.360 a troy ounce.
   Frozen pork belly futures fell to life-of-contract lows at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange because inventories are not shrinking
fast enough, analysts said.
   ``Because there's so much stockpiled, about 130 million bellies
have to go out between June 1 and October 1, or it's competing
against whatever's being produced in the fresh market,'' said Chuck
Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
``...everybody's seeking lower and lower levels until they find the
right price.''
   Frozen pork bellies were 1 cent to 1.6 cents lower, with July at
29.47 cents a pound; live hogs were .33 cent to .95 cent lower,
with June at 47.27 cents a pound; live cattle were .55 cent lower

cattle were .52 cent to .70 cent lower, with August at 76.52 cents
a pound.
   Crude oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange was 16
cents lower to 43 cents higher, with July at $19.95 a barrel;
heating oil was 5 cents to 25 cents lower, with June at 49.15 cents

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson's Son Quits Summer Internship at Drexel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson
resigned his summer internship at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
junk bond office Tuesday, the company said.
   Jonathan Luther Jackson, second son of the former Democratic
presidential candidate, was an intern in the credit research
department here, said Drexel spokesman Steve Anreder.
   ``He had been there for a while but he decided to leave,''
Anreder said. ``He's got some personal family matters to attend
to.''
   The spokesman didn't say when Jackson started the internship.
   Jackson planned to be a graduate student in business at
Northwestern University in Chicago in the fall, Anreder said. His
resume shows him to be a graduate of North Carolina Agricultural &amp;
Technical State University.
   His Drexel employment was reported in the May 26 issue of
Grant's interest rate observer, an investor newsletter covering
credit markets.
   Drexel agreed in January to pay the government $650 million to
settle civil charges of insider trading.

<HEAD>U.S. Computer Industry Says Milestone Reached in China Talks</HEAD>

   China is moving to solve a major trade dispute
with the United States by agreeing to provide legal protection from
piracy of imported computer programs, or software, U.S. industry
and government officials said Tuesday.
   A Chinese delegation last week signed a bilateral agreement with
U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills to cover computer programs
by law, and indicated that by the end of this year the Beijing
government would submit a copyright law for legislative approval,
the U.S. Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association
announced.
   The industry ``views this agreement with the Chinese as a
landmark in U.S.-Chinese intellectual property rights negotiations,
but we are keenly aware that progress is still merely in the
conceptual stage,'' said Oliver R. Smoot, the association's
executive vice president.
   In February, a CBEMA statement asserted that ``piracy of
computer programs is rampant'' in China.
   Industry officials said the agreement was concluded in
Washington last Thursday. Hours later, Mrs. Hills mentioned recent
``significant agreements'' with China, Taiwan and Colombia on
copyright and patent protection issues, but still named China and
seven other countries to a ``priority watch list'' on copyright and
patent protection. It calls for intensified negotiations and review
by Nov. 1 of their anti-piracy safeguards.
   Mrs. Hills' office did not immediately comment on the industry
statements. A State Department official, insisting on anonymity,
described the U.S.-China accord as a memorandum of understanding,
which is less binding than a formal agreement.
   Computer association officials said they understood the Thursday
agreement staved off harsher treatment for China in the U.S.
government's first application last week of the new 1988 Omnibus
Trade Act. Three countries, Japan, Brazil and India, were
designated for negotiations and potential punitive tariffs for
alleged unfair trade barriers.
   The Chinese Embassy quoted a foreign trade ministry official as
saying in a recent speech in China that ``administrative and
legislative measures can be taken to protect the interest of the
intellectual property rights holders.''
   Draft regulations on computer software protection should be
ready by the end of 1989, and China's 1989 legislative program
provides for submission to the People's Congress of a draft
revision of the patent law, the official, Liu Xiangeong, was quoted
as saying.
   Liu also mentioned the traditional Chinese position that
intellectual property such as computer software could be protected
with buyer-seller contract terms providing for confidentiality.
U.S. officials have said this fails to prevent copying and piracy
by outside parties.
   Differences over customs and patent protection have kept China
and the United States from making the customary five-year renewal
of their Science and Technology Agreement. Instead, they extended
it for only nine months in January.

   Wickes Cos. Inc. completed the
previously announced sales of its Wickes Furniture and Orchard
Supply hardware divisions for about $290 million, the company said
Tuesday.
   Orchard Supply, based in San Jose, was sold to a management-led
investor group headed by Maynard Jenkins, president and chief
executive officer of the hardware company. Wickes has previously
said the 31-store chain would be sold for $134 million.
   Wickes Furniture, based in Wheeling, Ill., was sold to a group
organized by its president and chief executive officer, John Klein.
The furniture company, which has 23 retail stores in Chicago, Los
Angeles, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Dallas, sold for $155 million,
the company said.
   Wickes, a conglomerate with holdings in retailing, auto products
and fabric and wallcoverings, has been selling assets since it was
bought last year by a partnership of Blackstone Capital Partners
and Wasserstein, Perella Partners.

   Malaysia Airlines ordered 16 Boeing 737s for
about $510 million and took options on 16 more Tuesday, Boeing Co.
officials said.
   A statement issued by Boeing said Malaysia's orders included 10
737-400s and six 737-500s, with delivery to begin in May 1992. The
types of jets to be bought under the options are to be decided
later if the options are exercised.
   CFM56-3C1 engines, made by a joint venture of SNECMA of France
and General Electric Co., were selected for all the firm orders and
options, the statement said.
   Airline officials said the new planes would replace 737-200s and
leased 737-400s in its fleet.
   Boeing's total orders for the year now stand at 568 planes
valued at about $31 billion, the statement said.

<HEAD>Leading Edge Agrees to Be Purchased by Daewoo Telecom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading Edge Products Inc. and Daewoo
Telecom Ltd. Inc. have signed a contract that will lead to the
purchase of Leading Edge by the South Korean company under a
reorganization plan, a bankruptcy court official said Tuesday.
   The plan, which requires court approval, would assure the
continued availability, sale and servicing of Leading Edge personal
computers and repayment in full of money owed by Leading Edge to
its dealers, according to Stephen M. Richmond, counsel to the
Chapter 11 reorganization trustee, Stephen Gray.
   Daewoo has been the exclusive manufacturer of Leading Edge's
Model D Series personal computer since 1985. Since then, Leading
Edge has sold $470 million worth of the machines, which use
software designed for International Business Machines Corp.
computers.
   The reorganization plan outlined in the contract will be filed
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Boston, and subsequently presented to
the creditors for approval, Richmond said.
   Leading Edge will be discharged from bankruptcy proceedings upon
approval of the plan by its creditors and confirmation by Chief
Judge James N. Gabriel of U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Boston.
   Leading Edge, founded by Michael Shane in 1980, sold $470
million worth of Leading Edge brand computers made by Daewoo in the
last 3{ years. The company, headquartered in this Boston suburb,
filed for reorganization Feb. 10.
   Daewoo Telecom is a manufacturer of computers and other office
automation and telecommunication products.

<HEAD>Head Of Troubled Bank Company Donated Heavily to Politicians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of financially troubled American
Continental Corp. of Phoenix and a circle of relatives and
associates donated more than $700,000 to political officeholders
over six years, the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday.
   The contributions of Charles H. Keating Jr. and about 75 people
close to him have come under scrutiny since American Continental
filed April 13 for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court.
   Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, American Continental's
principal subsidiary, was seized the next day by federal regulators
who alleged Keating and his company were operating the bank in an
unsound manner.
   The money from Keating and others went to 36 federal and state
politicians including more than $50,000 to U.S. Sens. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., and Pete Wilson, R-Calif., the Times said.
   More than $100,000 went to U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., more
than $55,000 to U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and about
$20,000 to U.S. Rep. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., the Times said.
   In addition, Ohio Democrat John Glenn received more than $34,500
from Keating associates, the paper reported.
   All of the senators involved said there was no impropriety in
taking money from Keating and his fund raisers and then later
taking up his cause in a dispute with federal savings and loan
regulators.
   At the California Capitol, where gubernatorial appointees
oversee Lincoln operations, more than $41,000 from Keating and the
others went to Republican Gov. George Deukmejian's campaign coffers
in the last four years, the paper said. Altogether, the Keating
group has given the California GOP $97,500 in the last four years,
the Times reported.
   In an Orange County Superior Court lawsuit, bondholders who
purchased $200 million in American Continental debt securities
claim Keating used his political connections to distract regulators
while he continued to sell junk bonds to depositors.
   Keating has denied the allegations in the lawsuit, one of
several class-action suits filed in Southern California and Arizona.
   Keating, as chairman of American Continental, a Phoenix real
estate development firm, bought Lincoln in 1984 and transformed it
from a traditional thrift to a more loosely structured S&amp;L that
ventured from home loans to investments in junk bonds.
