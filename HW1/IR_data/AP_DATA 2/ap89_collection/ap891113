   Rebels held large parts of
several poor neighborhoods Monday and battled soldiers in a third
day of the worst fighting the capital has experienced in a decade
of civil war.
   At least 305 people have been killed and 378 wounded since the
rebels attacked Saturday night, according to the armed forces
mortuary, civilian morgues and hospitals and unofficial military
figures. It is the biggest guerrilla offensive since 1981.
   Thousands of civilians were trapped in their homes by exchanges
of gunfire between the army and guerrillas of the leftist Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). Helicopter gunships and
military planes flew over the city to attack rebel positions.
   Few of the city's 1 million people were on the streets and
nearly all downtown stores were closed.
   Rebels were holding ground in an arc of heavily populated
northern districts.
   Military planes fired rockets Monday afternoon into the eastern
neighborhoods of Venecia and Conacaste, trying to drive out
guerrillas. Some rockets struck homes, killing several civilians
and wounding others.
   A broadcast on the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos Monday
night said, ``Every attempt by the army to recover these positions
has turned into a profound bloodbath among their troops and elite
corps. They have lost whole companies, producing a big
demoralization in enemy ranks.''
   Col. Rene Ponce, the army chief of staff, addressed the nation
on television and denied the rebels controlled any part of the
capital.
   ``There is no zone under FMLN control,'' he said. ``We are
fighting in some sectors on the edge of the capital.''
   He also said he ``roundly and categorically rejects the
accusations'' that military aircraft have bombed the capital. ``The
armed forces have not carried out any bombings in San Salvador,''
he said.
   Ricardo Alexander Perdomo, 12, said in a hospital: ``A bomb hit
the house and killed my mother and my little sister. A plane
dropped the bomb.'' He said guerrillas gave him first aid.
   U.S. Embassy sources said about 1,500 rebels were fighting in
the city. Heavy combat also was reported in Santa Ana, a western
province, in San Miguel to the east, around the central city of
Zacatecoluca and outside Usulutan, a major city in eastern El
Salvador.
   The army press office stopped providing casualty counts or other
information and telephone calls to provincial cities did not go
through.
   Officials at the armed forces mortuary said it had the bodies of
67 soldiers and military sources said 127 guerrillas had been
killed. Morgues reported the bodies of 51 civilians.
   Hospitals said 258 civilians had been wounded. On Sunday, the
armed forces reported 65 soldiers and 55 guerrillas wounded.
   The U.S. Embassy said 86 soldiers, 202 guerrillas and 17
civilians had been killed, a total of 305. Its count of 373 wounded
included 189 soldiers, 96 rebels and 88 civilians, the embassy
said, and 43 guerrillas were captured.
   Rosales Hospital, a government institution, was without water,
blood plasma, anaesthetics and other supplies, said Dr. Fausto Cea
Gil, the director. Stretchers lined hallways outside emergency
rooms.
   President Alfredo Cristiani announced a state of siege and a 6
p.m.-6 a.m. curfew Sunday and legislators were considering more
restrictions on civil rights.
   The Bush administration said Cristiani's government had not
requested U.S. assistance in repelling the rebel attack.
   ``It's our belief that they are in control of the situation at
this point,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
Asked whether he would rule out U.S. involvement in the fighting,
he said: ``At this point it's not anticipated.''
   Fifty-five U.S. military trainers are stationed in El Salvador
but are not supposed to participate in military missions. Fitzwater
said their status was unchanged.
   The rebels began their offensive, attacking 35 to 40 military
posts in the city and others in the provinces, after pulling out of
peace talks to protest attacks on leftist political and union
leaders. They blame the military and the Cristiani government for
the attacks.
   Cristiani, who took office June 1, leads the rightist
Nationalist Republican Alliance, known as Arena. His party has been
linked to death squads that operated with near-impunity early in
the war and are blamed for most of the 70,000 deaths.
   Heavy fighting continued in densely populated neighborhoods on
the northern and eastern edges of San Salvador.
   ``We came down from the mountains and we're going to stay
here,'' said a guerrilla who identified himself only as Porfirio.
``We're winning so far and we have their morale down.''
   Porfirio gestured with his AK-47 assault rifle toward soldiers
in the distance who seemed to be preparing for an attack.
   Beatriz, an 18-year-old guerrilla with an M-16 rifle, said in
Soyapango, an eastern suburb: ``The order is that, instead of
retreating, we have to advance inside.''
   Army troopers took up positions about 300 yards away. Eight
bodies, apparently guerrillas, lay nearby.
   Rebel snipers controlled the tallest buildings in Metropolis and
Zacamil, said a woman who fled the area.
   In Soyapango, a woman approached reporters and asked for help.
   ``We have no water, no food,'' she said. ``We have been here
since Saturday and the children haven't eaten anything. Help us!''
   Many people knew little of what was going on around them. After
fighting began, the government ordered radio stations into a
national network and took news programs off the air.
   Television stations broadcast their usual programs, but were not
allowed to transmit news.
   Under the state of siege declared by Cristiani, free speech,
freedom of movement and the right to assemble are suspended.
   Civilians killed in the guerrilla offensive include an American
teacher in San Salvador, the State Department said. Kay Babcock of
Spokane, Wash., said the victim was her 25-year-old son,
Christopher.

<HEAD>Dartmouth Trustees to Divest South African Investments</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 3-6, ``The investments ...,' with 11 grafs to UPDATE

ANC representative; picks up 7th graf, ``By law ...''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Dartmouth College will sell off $11.5
million worth of investments in companies doing business in South
Africa by the end of the year, the Board of Trustees announced
Monday.
   The Ivy League school, which has been a hot spot in the debate
in this country over South Africa's apartheid policies, will also
refrain from such investments in the future, the board said in a
statement.
   Dartmouth President James Freedman read the announcement at a
faculty meeting, and 250 to 300 students who were present cheered.
   The board said the investments have ``great symbolic meaning,''
and that disputes over them undermine Dartmouth's ability to
achieve some educational goals.
   ``The trustees recognize that many firms continuing to do
business in South Africa are making positive contributions to the
lives of their employees and the political process in South
Africa,'' the statement said.
   The board said it made the decision to divest Saturday after
discussing the adverse impact of ``these nominal investments.''
   Dartmouth's investments in companies doing business in South
Africa have declined from $63 million, or 15 percent of its
endowment, to $11.5 million, or less than 2 percent, the board said.
   After the announcement, Heetan Kalan, a sophomore who heads the
International Student Association on campus, said, ``I'm
speechless. It's a great victory.''
   A representative of the African National Congress who has worked
for 15 years to get Dartmouth to divest its South African
investments said he still can't believe the fight is over.
   Themba Ntinga, a representative to the United Nations for the
ANC, was at the school Monday to debate Peter Soal, a member of
South Africa's Parliament. Both men had been invited to Dartmouth
before the decision to divest.
   ``It's totally unexpected,'' said Ntinga, whose organization is
outlawed in South Africa. ``It's a sweet victory for the principles
of fairness.
   ``This not only will send a message to (South Africa), but also
to the racist South African Parliament itself,'' he said.
   Divestment had not been on the agenda for the trustees' weekend
meeting. Freedman said he did not think a weekend protest during
the trustees' meeting had anything to do with the decision.
   By law and custom, South Africa's apartheid policy establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Since 1972, Dartmouth has adopted investment policies that
included prohibitions against investments in South African
companies, financial institutions making loans to the South African
government, companies supplying goods and services involved in
enforcing apartheid and companies doing business in South Africa
that didn't adhere to certain employment practices.
   In November 1985, students built shanties on Dartmouth Green to
protest apartheid. The following January, 12 students, including
nine members of the off-campus Dartmouth Review, attacked the
shanties with sledgehammers, saying the school should not be held
hostage by any group and that the shanties were erected illegally.
   Dartmouth pressured the students to move the shanties off
campus. The last one was removed that February after the college
had 18 students who stood in the way arrested. Dartmouth dropped
all charges against the 18.
   Also in 1985, some faculty members urged gradual divestment. The
college began reducing its investments that year. Faculty members
again urged divestment last year.

<HEAD>Newspaper Reports Craig Spence Sent Farewell Message to Friends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Craig Spence, a lobbyist linked to a
homosexual prostitution service who was found dead in a Boston
hotel room Friday, sent a farewell taped message to several
friends, according to a published report.
   The Washington Post reported in Monday's editions it had
obtained a copy of the seven-minute ``video postcard'' that Spence
had sent to about a dozen friends. The newspaper also published a
photograph of Spence it said was taken from the tape.
   ``Take heart, good friends,'' The Post reported Spence as
saying. ``The pressures on us over the past several years have
been, let us say, significant.''
   He joked about his Maltese dog, Winston, being misidentified in
news reports as a terrier, saying, ``Winston's holding up, and I'm
working at it.''
   The newspaper said Spence, who had reportedly taken male
prostitutes on a midnight tour of the White House in July 1988, had
taped the message as he sat in a leather chair at his home two
weeks before his death.
   The report also revealed details of Spence's death obtained by
the newspaper from police and an unidentified friend of Spence's.
   The Post said Spence had spent the week in Boston visiting
friends and handing out $100 tips to waiters at the Ritz-Carlton
where he was found.
   Spence, who was under investigation by police and the Secret
Service for possible credit card fraud in connection with a male
prostitution service, was found dead, dressed in a black tuxedo and
white suspenders and lying on a bed in the hotel room. The
king-sized bed blocked the door of the room.
   His birth certificate and will also were found, as well as a
prescription bottle for an antidepressant, sources said.
   Authorities said an autopsy was done Saturday but an exact cause
of death could not be determined until toxicology tests are
completed in two to three weeks.

<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old boy was shot to death
when he went to a suspected drug house with his sister to get her
belongings, police said. A 14-year-old boy was arrested.
   Police said they found Frederick Jones lying in the street after
receiving a report of a shooting about 5 p.m. Saturday. The boy was
taken to a hospital where he died about an hour later from a shot
to the chest.
   ``There is no motive,'' said Sgt. Pete Edlund of the homicide
unit.
   ``He knocked on the door, a guy said, `Who is it?' then the door
opened'' and a shot was fired.
   Relatives of the boy said he and his 14-year-old sister,
LaTrisha Weekly, went to the house where they lived until a month
ago. LaTrisha said their mother's former boyfriend lives at the
house but was out of town.
   LaTrisha said Sunday that the 14-year-old suspect let her in and
she went upstairs to collect her clothes. Her brother followed her
to the door.
   Police refused to say if the shooting was drug-related, but
members of the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime and neighbors said the
house has a history of drug dealings.
   Edlund said police recovered weapons at the house. He would not
say whether a drug transaction was involved, but he said it is not
unusual to see children in the drug trade.
   ``We see 8-, 9- and 10-year-olds running drugs and selling them
in the street,'' he said.
   The suspect will be referred to juvenile court, which will
decide whether he should stand trial as an adult.
   The killing came four days after voters in the Kansas City, Mo.,
area approved a quarter-cent increase in the sales tax to raise $98
million during the next seven years to fight the war on drugs. The
measure passed 60 percent to 40 percent.
   It also comes at a time when police are growing worried that a
shortage of crack cocaine could spur violence in the city.
   ``Six weeks ago, when the big glut was on, some dope houses were
selling two rocks for the price of one,'' said Sgt. Dan Mulloy of
the street narcotics unit. ``The supply and demand situation went
berserk. Everybody was dealing dope. Then all of a sudden, it was
like boom. The door slammed.''
   Although it is too early to know what is causing the shortage or
how long it will last, it is creating new hazards in the already
dangerous drug trade.
   Undercover officers say they are facing increasingly hostile
dealers strung out from their own drug habits and eager to protect
their wares. One undercover detective was shot Nov. 2, and police
worry that more shootings could follow.
   Just as troubling is an increase in fake, or ``turkey,'' drugs
made of soap, candle wax or pancake mix, which dealers are selling
to addicts. Police fear the practice could lead to more violence
when the deals go bad.
   Authorities also say the shortage is pushing up the price of
cocaine, which could lead to more drug-related crime as users
struggle to finance their habit. An agent for the Drug Enforcement
Administration in Kansas City said 1 kilogram of cocaine now sells
for $25,000, up from $20,000 just a month ago.

<HEAD>Discriminatory Clubs and Judicial Nominees: Senate Faces Painful
Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators are preparing to decide an issue that
touches some of America's most sensitive nerve endings: should a
member of a private club that bars women and minorities be
confirmed as a federal judge?
   ``The question is, do organizations like the Olympic Club hurt
people? And it seems to me absolutely that they do,'' Professor
Stephen Gillers of New York University School of Law told the
Senate Judiciary Committee last week.
   The question for the Senate is whether to confirm San Francisco
attorney Vaughn Walker as a District Court judge despite the fact
that he has for 15 years belonged to that city's embattled Olympic
Club, long a bastion of white male dominance.
   The club barred blacks from its rolls for decades and still
refuses to admit women as full members.
   The larger issue extending beyond California is whether the
Senate should confirm judges who belong to such clubs. Liberals and
civil rights organizations say the answer is no.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee could take a step toward
answering those questions Thursday if it votes on whether to send
the Walker nomination to the Senate floor. Supporters of Walker are
pushing for a vote.
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., hasn't
announced whether he will call for a vote. Any one of Walker's
critics on the panel could block action under committee rules.
   The Walker nomination is the most pressing in the long-running
tug-of-war between liberals and conservatives on the Senate
Judiciary Committee over federal judiciary nominees.
   Also facing the panel is a potentially more explosive dispute
over President Bush's naming of Clarence Thomas, chairman of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as a judge of the U.S.
Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. That issue is
guaranteed to spill over into next year.
   The lawmakers also are being asked to approve elevation of
Bush's cousin, District Judge John Walker of New York, to the
appeals bench. Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz alleges the
nomination violates federal anti-nepotism law. When the issue will
be resolved is unclear.
   Thursday's executive session of the Judiciary Committee is the
last planned for this year.
   Thus, Thursday could be the final trip to the plate in 1989 for
Vaughn Walker in his frustrating, two-year quest for judicial
confirmation.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, an outspoken critic of
discriminatory clubs, and other liberals say such memberships
create an image of unfairness that has no place on the bench. The
American Bar Association has adopted rules discouraging
confirmation of judicial nominees who belong to clubs that bar
minorities and women.
   Few if any senators defend discriminatory clubs. But Sen. Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo., and other conservatives say there are more
important issues to consider in evaluating judicial nominees.
   At first blush, Vaughn Walker's credentials appear solid. The
silver-haired, 45-year-old attorney has a law degree from Stanford,
a partnership in a blue-chip company and a ``well qualified''
rating from his local bar association.
   Like most District Court nominees, he has the blessing of a
home-state senator, in this case Republican Pete Wilson. But his
longtime membership in the Olympic Club has been dogging the
nomination for almost two years.
   The matter is made more complicated because after being besieged
about the club and its discriminatory policy for eight months,
Walker resigned in a letter dated Feb. 15.
   But critics say that's not enough. They say he was too slow in
removing his name from the membership roles and did too little to
fight the policy of excluding women.
   ``I still wonder whether he resigned because he believed his
club membership was wrong or because he sought to curry favor with
the committee,'' Metzenbaum told a hearing Thursday.
   He questioned Walker closely on why the resignation letter was
not marked as received by the club until April 15 and why he paid
his dues through March. Walker said he gave the letter to a club
officer for delivery in February and that was the last he saw of
it. He said he inadvertently paid March dues because they were on
the same bill with his February club expenses.
   Republican senators registered increasing impatience. After
listening to the interrogation, Simpson left for another hearing,
describing the questions as ``balderdash.''
   Meanwhile, the Senate will debate Monday and vote Tuesday on
rival Republican and Democratic proposals to provide economic aid
to Poland and Hungary.
   The Democratic version authorizes a three-year package with a
value of nearly $1 billion, while the Republican version calls for
a little more than half that. The idea is to furnish funds to the
two East European nations to assist them as they embark on
wide-ranging reforms.
   Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa will address a joint
meeting of the House and Senate at midweek.
   The Senate plans two days of action on Bush's proposal to reduce
the capital gains tax. Republicans, who have been trying
unsuccessfully to push the tax cut through Congress all year, are
expected to be defeated and have promised that if they are they
will not raise the issue again until 1990.
   Congressional leaders and Bush administration officials continue
their efforts to reach agreement on a package cutting $14 billion
from this year's deficit of $116 billion. Weeks of closed-door
bargaining has left Democrats and Republicans at odds over how to
reduce the shortfall.
   Meanwhile, $16 billion in cuts imposed under the Gramm-Rudman
law on most federal programs Oct. 16 remain in effect.

<HEAD>The Island That Held Back Turks Prepares for Superpower Invasion</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Mediterranean island that held back
the Turks in an epic 16th-century siege and withstood heavy bombing
by the Germans and Italians in World War II is now bracing for an
invasion by today's superpowers.
   Officials making land arrangements for the Dec. 2-3 offshore
summit of President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev are expecting an
army of some 2,000 people between delegations and journalists _ or
about three times the size of the Maltese armed forces.
   For an island more accustomed to putting on horse-and-armor
medieval costume parties for British and West German tourists than
catering to the security and communication needs of such a
gathering, the summit came as a shock.
   ``When I heard the news I thought the moon had fallen from the
sky,'' said Arthur L. Pace, the government's director of
information.
   But Malta, which had a 2,000-year history of foreign domination
until it achieved independence from Britain in 1964, sees the
summit as an opportunity to make its contribuition to world peace
as well as promote its tourist facilities and ambitions to become
an offshore banking center.
   And the summit is seen as a dry run for the first visit by Pope
John Paul II to the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic island in May.
   With history the stuff of Malta and politics considered the
national pastime, summit followers will get a dose of both. The
opposition party is promising a protest against nuclear-armed
warships.
   As the site of offices of the U.S. and Soviet delegations and
the international press center, organizers have chosen the
Mediterranean Conference Center, a monumental complex built as a
hospital by the Knights of Malta in 1574.
   It was the knights, mobilized to defend Christian Europe, who
held onto the island during the long siege by the Ottoman Turks in
1565. Malta came under British rule in 1800.
   The complex, with its vaulted ceilings and religious reliefs,
suffered heavy bombing damage in World War II, when King George VI
of Britain awarded the population the George Cross for bravery and
Winston Churchill referred to Malta as the ``unsinkable aircraft
carrier.''
   The building was completely restored and repaired again after a
1987 fire in its main auditorium. Maltese organizers hope to keep
the onshore activities within the confines of the center while the
leaders meet aboard ships.
   There has been no official confirmation, but Maltese expect the
warships to be anchored in Marsaxlokk Bay, within sight of fishing
villages on the island's eastern end.
   Last year, at the time of a visit by the British aircraft
carrier Ark Royal, Parliament adopted a resolution saying Malta
expects that visiting ships won't be carrying nuclear weapons.
   The conservative government of Prime Minister Edward Fenech
Adami hopes the Soviets and Americans will take heed. But the
leftist opposition plans a demonstration if assurances are lacking.
   ``Bush and Gorbachev are absolutely welcome, they will be
welcomed by all Maltese people,'' said Joseph Brincat, deputy
leader of the Malta Labor Party, adding ``Is it necessary to have a
nuclear warship in Grand Harbor?``
   Diplomats say the island's improved ties with Washington and
loosened links with Libya, its central location in the
Mediterranean and its official policy of neutrality and
non-alignment apparently played a role in the decision to hold the
summit off Malta.
   Gorbachev will be arriving from a visit to Italy and the Vatican.
   One of Fenech Adami's first official acts was to scrap part of a
1984 friendship treaty with Libya calling for exchange of military
and security information. It was under this pact that Malta gave
advance warning to Libya of the U.S. air raids on Tripoli and
Benghazi in April 1986.
   Libyan officials are due here in coming days to renegotiate the
pact and the military clause is expected to be formally dropped.
   Although trade with Libya is flourishing, officials stress the
government is trying to change the direction of Maltese foreign
policy from 16 years of Socialist rule. Says Austin Gatt, secretary
general of the Nationalist Party:
   ``We want friendly relations with everyone (and) look to the
Western world as a natural ally.''
   Organizers also believe the visit of Bush's brother, William, to
September ceremonies marking the 25th anniversary of Maltese
independence played a key role in the choice of Malta.

<HEAD>Computer Criminals May be Able to Escape Prosecution under Current
Laws</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Computer crime specialists fear that renegade
programmers who attack the nation's computing networks with viruses
and other software mischief may be able to escape prosecution under
existing laws.
   Joseph B. Tompkins Jr., chairman of the American Bar
Association's Task Force on Computer Crime, told a congressional
panel this past week that ``there are clearly some types of
computer virus activity that would be beyond the terms of the
current statute.''
   He and other witnesses outlined a series of activities that
could fall through the cracks of ambiguous federal laws.
   For example, if a computer hacker sends a program laced with a
hidden virus to an electronic bulletin board, can he be prosecuted
for harm that results when other bulletin board users transfer the
virus-infected software into their own systems?
   Can the hacker be successfully prosecuted if he claims that he
really didn't have any malicious intent, but instead was merely
trying to pull off an innocent prank _ or aiming to demonstrate
existing weaknesses in computer security?
   Under current federal law, the answer to both questions is
``maybe.''
   These are among key issues being considered by the House
Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice as it studies
legislation designed to help fight viruses and other forms of
malicious software.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said last
week that computer viruses ``cost industry and government at least
millions of dollars in damage and disruption ... and yet there is
no specific federal criminal statute in place to attack this type
of malicious programming.''
   Schumer said afterward that ``it seems to me that presently not
enough is going on'' to combat viruses. ``I think the likelihood is
that we will do some kind of legislation,'' he said.
   Computer viruses generally are small strings of computer code
that can ``infect'' legitimate computer programs and may cause
destruction or alteration of data files.
   The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 makes it a federal
crime to ``intentionally access a federal interest computer without
authorization and alter, destroy or damage information in such
computer or prevent authorized access to such computer if such
conduct causes the loss of $1,000 or more during any one-year
period.''
   ``Federal interest'' applies to U.S. government computers,
computers of financial institutions and cases involving computers
located in more than one state.
   But at last week's hearing, Tompkins said ``the statute does not
in clear terms cover the intentional implantation of a computer
virus in a computer which one is authorized to access, even if the
perpetrator clearly intended harm or the virus in fact caused
significant harm.''
   The question of intent has been raised in the federal court case
pending against Robert Tappan Morris, 24, of Arnold, Md.
   Morris, who at the time was a Cornell University graduate
student, has been indicted in connection with the so-called
``worm'' which in November 1988 paralyzed about 6,000 computers
connected to the Internet electronic network.
   The case is slated to go to trial Nov. 29 in Syracuse, N.Y. If
convicted, Morris faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   Morris' attorney sought to have the indictment dismissed on
several grounds, contending that Morris did not have the intent to
cause losses of $1,000 or more. However, the government argued that
the statute requires only that the defendant intend to access a
federal interest computer without authorization.
   Tompkins said ``the fact that the intent requirement ... was the
subject of serious dispute indicates that the provision should be
reviewed.''
   He said the law also has been attacked as unconstitutionally
vague.
   ``While these arguments are probably overstated, clarifying the
statute might prevent such arguments from being raised and might
encourage prosecutors to make more frequent use of the statute,''
he said.
   Three anti-virus bills are pending in the House, sponsored by
Reps. Wally Herger, R-Calif.; C. Thomas McMillen, D-Md.; and Edward
J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance.
   Herger's bill would impose penalties of up to 20 years in prison
on people convicted of ``interfering with the operations of
computers through the use of programs containing hidden commands
that can cause harm.''
   The McMillen measure seeks to punish anyone who ``willfully and
knowingly sabotages the proper operation of a computer hardware
system or the associated software.'' Markey's bill would make the
introduction of a computer virus into an interstate electronic
network a federal crime.
   At last week's hearing, the legislative initiatives were
strongly criticized by John L. Pickitt, president of the Computer
and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, a
Washington-based industry group whose member companies last year
had combined sales of more than $230 billion.
   ``Like the swine flu vaccine of the 1970s, these anti-virus
bills could end up doing more harm than good,'' he testified.
   Pickitt contended that ``outlawing some of the programming
techniques used to create computer viruses might prevent the use of
similar programs for beneficial purposes, including countering a
virus.''
   Also, he said, ``the same sharing techniques which make computer
networks vulnerable to virus attack can also be responsible for
breakthroughs in electronics and telecommunications technology.''

   Members of the House and Senate are likely to
cheer themselves hoarse when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
addresses a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday.
   But the rush of events in Walesa's Poland and across Eastern
Europe has taken on a life of its own and there's little American
lawmakers can do but shout encouragement.
   Like sports fans jamming a coliseum, they are able to cheer
their team but unable to get into the game. The one exception, an
aid package for Poland and Hungary, has been debated for months but
could be approved just in time for Walesa's speech.
   In many respects, the flood of events in Eastern Europe has
stunned the capital like the sudden crumbling of a giant dam, long
thought to be indestructible but revealed as old and poorly
maintained.
   The events:
   _The symbolic destruction of the ultimate icon of communism's
grip on Eastern Europe, the Berlin Wall.
   _The mass exodus of East German citizens and tumultuous
anti-government demonstrations on East German streets.
   _The Democratic tide in Hungary and the removal of its section
of the Iron Curtain.
   _The advance of democratic institutions in Poland under Walesa's
Solidarity union.
   _The reform program of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
with its underpinnings of economic restructuring and a new openness
in thought and speech.
   The cheers came quickly, but with them came words of caution.
   ``We should be clear, but prudent, in our own actions,'' said
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``We should not do
anything at this point which might needlessly add fuel to the
fire.''
   The one issue rushing to the surface in the aftermath of the
East German decision to open its borders to all wanting to leave is
the possibility that it will prove the first step toward the
reunification of the two Germanies.
   Many members of Congress believe that's an issue far too hot for
American involvement.
   The future of East and West Germany is something Congress should
think hard about, Dole said, adding that it's far too early to do
more than think.
   ``They are not issues for heated rhetoric right now,'' Dole said.
   Another caution came from Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   ``This is a historic event,'' he said of the decision to open
East German borders. ``It can be made even more so if the East
German government now acts to tear the wall down. Only then will we
know that their decision has lasting substance and meaning.''
   Some in Congress believe the time is coming to address the issue
of drastically reducing the American troop presence in Eastern
Europe.
   Many others say that is decidedly premature.
   They point out that the military forces of the Soviet Union, and
of the Warsaw Pact for that matter, remain intact and formidable.
   Arms control negotiations, both in nuclear and conventional
arms, are said to be making important progress. But they are far
from complete.
   Reducing U.S. troop strength, or lowering NATO's military
shield, are unlikely events short of stunningly successful arms
control negotiations and stability on the European continent.
   In the one area where Congress is prepared to do something
concrete _ aid to Poland and Hungary _ the rhetoric has been strong
and the action slow.
   By the time Walesa takes the podium in the House, Congress may
have passed legislation authorizing several hundred million dollars
in aid to Poland's non-communist government and to Hungary as well.
   But in contrast to the dazzling speed of events in Eastern
Europe, the aid bill has been traveling through the Capitol's
marble halls with the pace of an overweight snail, its passage
marked with partisan haggling over the price.
   By and large, Democrats have advocated far higher spending
levels than Republicans.
   The two days before Walesa's speech will be marked by Senate
debate over a three-year Democratic plan costing nearly $1 billion
and a more modest Republican package a little more than half as
expensive.
   Democrats have criticized President Bush as being ``overly
timid'' on the whole subject.
   Many Senate Democrats said the Republicans had embarrassed
Congress by attempting, for a time, to tie the Poland-Hungary aid
package to a totally unrelated domestic political controversy _ the
capital gains tax cut.
   But if Poland's staunchest supporters on Capitol Hill have their
way, Walesa and the aid package will arrive together.

   Dame Joan Sutherland says she knows when it's time
to step aside and leave the opera spotlight to younger singers.
   ``I'd rather leave you with a pleasant sound in your ears than
start croaking too much,'' the 63-year-old soprano told fans
Saturday at her final U.S. opera performance, at the Music Hall at
Fair Park.
   The appearance, in the title role in ``The Merry Widow,''
featured a fond farewell message from President Bush, who wrote,
``Dame Joan's coloratura soprano echos in the minds of all who have
been privileged to hear her sing.''
   After the opera _ on the stage where the Australian native made
her U.S. debut 29 years ago _ she said plans to continue giving
concerts, but only two more operas, in London and in Australia.
   Miss Sutherland said she is retiring so she can spend more time
at her home in Switzerland.

   Novelist William Styron says that in 1986 he
almost joined the ranks of such authors as Ernest Hemingway,
Virginia Woolf and Jack London who have committed suicide.
   ``Like many great American writers,'' Styron wrote in December's
Vanity Fair, ``I used alcohol as the magical conduit to fantasy and
euphoria, and to the enhancement of the imagination.''
   But in 1985, Styron's body suddenly rejected alcohol, ``which
for so long had kept my demons at bay.'' Deprived of this crutch,
depression swooped in.
   After months of emotional darkness, he said, he redrafted his
will, penned a suicide note, and threw out a prized personal
journal in preparation for killing himself.
   But, he said, ``I drew upon some last gleam of sanity,'' and the
next day checked himself into a hospital for treatment.

   Leftist rebels launched their
biggest offensive in San Salvador in the 10-year-old civil war,
battling troops in fighting in which at least 127 people were
killed, the military said Sunday.
   President Alfredo Cristiani declared a nationwide curfew and
state of siege. Cristiani's official residence was among the
targets of the rebels' offensive, launched Saturday night. He was
at his private home and was unhurt.
   At least 317 people were wounded in the offensive, which
continued into early Monday, according to reports from hospitals
and the military.
   An American teacher was among the dead.
   Rebels claimed 400 soldiers were killed or wounded in what
officials called the broadest series of attacks in the city of 1
million in a decade of fighting. It was the biggest coordinated
attack since an offensive in the provinces in 1981.
   There were reports of fighting in four of the country's 14
provinces, including the northern section of San Salvador, much of
which was being held by heavily armed rebels.
   ``The boys are in the high buildings. They have snipers who have
the soldiers controlled,'' a woman who fled the area said.
   In the area's Metropolis neighborhood, residents helped rebels
dig trenches and soldiers stayed at a distance, reporters who
entered the area said.
   In at least one neighborhood they occupied, rebels held meetings
to tell residents how to protect themselves from air attacks and
other fighting.
   A nurse at the Rosales Hospital said it was running short of
some supplies.
   ``Since last night, they have not stopped bringing in wounded,''
said the nurse, who gave her name only as Mrs. Luna.
   The international airport was closed after military
installations were attacked by mortar fire but opened briefly
Sunday for arriving flights. Some passengers were stranded because
there were no taxis to take them into San Salvador, a 45-minute
drive away.
   Cristiani announced a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and the state of
siege in an address on radio and television. The state of siege
restricts transit, the freedom of expression, rights of assembly
and privacy of correspondence.
   ``You must heed the call to not go out in the streets, to stay
in your houses or where you are right now,'' Cristiani said. ``The
terrorists must know that there are judicial tools to fight these
irrational attacks.''
   The armed forces press office said 26 soldiers had been killed
and 65 wounded. Guerrilla deaths totaled 93 and 55 were wounded, it
said. Rebels gave no figures on their own casualties.
   The armed forces said eight civilians were killed and 35 wounded.
   Carlos Mendoza, spokesman for the Salvadoran Red Cross, said in
a telephone interview that at least 20 civilians had been killed.
   Among those killed Saturday night was a U.S. citizen who taught
at the American High School in San Salvador, according to U.S.
Embassy spokesman Barry Jacobs. Jacobs gave no details and said the
victim's name was being withheld pending notification of family
members.
   The attacks came three days after the rebel Farabundo Marti
Liberation Front vowed to intensify the insurgency, in which more
than 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed.
   Rebel leaders on Wednesday also pulled out of a a third round of
peace talks with the U.S.-backed government, claiming Cristiani's
rightist administration had not been serious about negotiating an
end to the conflict.
   In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told NBC he did not
believe U.S. military would get involved, and he called the offense
``a move of desperation by the guerrillas.''
   In a broadcast over their clandestine Radio Venceremos, the
guerrillas said the San Salvador attacks were part of a national
offensive called ``Remove the fascists, Febe Elizabeth lives.''
   Febe Elizabeth Velazquez was a union leader who perished in an
Oct. 31 explosion at the National Federation of Salvadoran Workers.
The rebels claim the government was behind that attack, which
killed 10 people and wounded more than 30.
   ``Today we are fighting against misery, against those who stay
in power through savagery aimed at churches, universities,
opposition political parties, guilds, unions and dissident
sectors,'' the rebel broadcast said.
   Government troops and a tank entered El Salvador National
University Sunday and damaged some buildings when they opened fire,
a photographer said.
   Twelve students and workers were detained and taken by truck to
a military base, according to the photographer. He said the
prisoners were accused of harboring guerrillas.
   A guerrilla leader who identified himself as Commander Fernandez
told reporters Sunday, ``Here we will die fighting. They won't
remove us from here.''
   At a news conference at a home in northern San Salvador, the
guerrilla leader said, ``This is the start of the counteroffensive.
We won't leave until the government gives up or calls us to the
negotiating table.''
   In Managua, Nicaragua, the government-run radio Voice of
Nicaragua broadcast a statement by Salvadoran guerrillas warning
civilians living near military installations to leave.
   The rebel statement also warned Salvadorans that areas near
downed power lines had been mined and said first-aid vehicles
should not transport military casualties. It said gasoline stations
should close immediately and all transportation should stop at
midnight.
   Military headquarters in the eastern cities of San Miguel and
Usulutan were attacked, said Col. Rene Ponce, chief of the joint
chiefs of staff.
   He said other rebel targets included the home of the president
of the legislative assembly, Ricardo Alvarenga; the 1st Infantry
Brigade; police headquarters in the Mejicanos neighborhood; the 3rd
Infantry Brigade in San Miguel, and the 6th Brigade in Usulutan.
   Alvarenga escaped injury but the attack on his house left at
least one guerrilla dead and two guards wounded, hospital officials
said.
   Cristiani is the leader of the rightist Nationalist Republican
Alliance, or Arena, and was installed in office June 1 after
winning the presidential election.

   NASA this month plans to embark on a $400
million mission during which a satellite will study radiation left
from the ``big bang,'' the 15-billion-year-old blast that
scientists say created the universe.
   The space agency hopes the launch will produce the most
comprehensive observations ever of the early universe and the
processes that shaped it to form stars and galaxies.
   The $150 million Cosmic Background Explorer, a 16-by-28-foot
satellite, will be boosted into orbit 559 miles above Earth by
NASA's last unmanned rocket, said George Diller, an agency
spokesman.
   The Vandenberg Air Force Base launch had been scheduled for
Friday but has been delayed until at least Nov. 19 to replace a
malfunctioning guidance computer on the two-stage Delta rocket.
   The 116-foot rocket that will lift the 5,000-pound Explorer into
orbit will be the 184th Delta launched by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration and the last expendable rocket NASA will
ever launch, Diller said.
   NASA stopped buying rockets in the early 1980s, deciding to
launch payloads from shuttles after its booster inventory was
exhausted. After the 1986 Challenger explosion, NASA said it was
wrong to rely on the shuttle. Then President Reagan ordered the
agency to stop launching commercial payloads and give such business
to private industry.
   After a 30-day shakedown, the solar-powered Explorer will spend
up to two years using three sensitive detectors to study how the
universe and its stars and galaxies developed, program scientist
Larry Caroff said from Washington.
   The instruments will measure ``cosmic background'' radiation.
Such radiation is different than dangerous ionizing radiation. It
includes microwaves, infrared light and ``submillimeter'' radiation
left over from the big bang _ the gargantuan explosion that
scientists believe was the fireball of creation.
   ``If God created the universe, he or she did it about 15 billion
years ago _ and did it with a bang,'' Caroff said.
   In an instant, a single point of matter expanded explosively
into a hot, dense and extraordinarily uniform sphere of gas
containing electrically charged particles, according to the theory.
   ``Think of a sphere with us at the center,'' Caroff said. The
surface ``is moving away from us very fast, glowing and emitting
radiation. That sphere is the hot gas characteristic of the early
universe. We have to look very, very far back in time, which means
very far out in the universe, to see that hot surface.''
   By measuring cosmic background radiation, the Explorer will look
back to certain times in the history of the universe, he explained.
   One of Explorer's instruments will measure infrared light, or
heat, emitted when the first atoms are believed to have formed
500,000 years after the big bang. That will help scientists learn
if, between three minutes to 500,000 years after the big bang, the
universe was shaped by exotic phenomena such as black holes, which
are so dense their gravity sucks in light.
   The satellite's microwave sensor will look for differences in
the brightness of cosmic background radiation to determine if the
big bang's fireball was equally bright in all directions.
   ``Out of that extraordinarily uniform collection of hot matter
eventually had to come galaxies and stars _ what is obviously a
very lumpy distribution of matter,'' Caroff said. ``The seeds of
that lumpiness must have been present in the early universe, and
the (microwave) instrument is meant to look for those seeds.''
   Explorer's third sensor will search for a burst of luminous
infrared and submillimeter radiation that scientists believed was
produced when the first stars and galaxies formed 200 million years
after the big bang.
   Telescopes ``can see distant galaxies a few billion years back
in time, but nothing like this,'' Caroff said. ``This will be the
first time anyone will be able to see evidence of the formation of
the first galaxies.''
   Caroff said the Explorer mission's cost includes $150 million
for the satellite and sensors, $70 million for the rocket and
launch and $160 million for manpower at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in Maryland. About $20 million is for operations and data
analysis through the end of the mission.

   New Hampshire primary watchers, always wary
of threats to their state's earliest-in-the-nation presidential
primary, have turned their eyes westward toward the
biggest-in-the-nation: California.
   Rich, hip and populated, California is tired of having little
say in the presidential nominating process because the nominees
usually have been chosen long before Californians vote in June.
   Come January, legislators in the delegate-loaded state will
reconsider a proposal to move the state's primary to early March,
shortly after New Hampshire's.
   Will California's 27 million people mute New Hampshire's 1
million? Will its multiple media markets lure commentators'
attention from the grass roots, person-to-person struggle here?
   ``Absolutely not. It will have just the opposite effect,'' said
Robert Craig, a University of New Hampshire political analyst.
``All you have to do is ask yourself whether you'd like to be on
the cover of Time or Newsweek four days before the California
primary.''
   State Democratic Chairman Joseph Grandmaison and his Republican
counterpart, Rhona Charbonneau, agree.
   ``We're a small, close state,'' Charbonneau said. ``The media
will still be here. It's tradition ... and maybe superstition.''
   Since 1952, no one has been elected president without winning
New Hampshire.
   Supporters say New Hampshire's primary _ and, more recently,
Iowa's party caucuses _ should come early because personal contacts
are more effective than sound bytes in small states.
   They say the grassroots campaigning that has catapulted
long-shots to victory is impossible in a huge state like California
or a regional primary like ``Super Tuesday'' in the South in 1988.
   ``People make a mistake thinking that the only thing New
Hampshire has going for it is its early date,'' said Concord lawyer
Thomas Rath, who ran Bob Dole's 1988 primary campaign in New
Hampshire.
   He said the willingness of people in New Hampshire to get
involved early, their tightknit communities and the ``earned''
media exposure makes a victory worth billions in advertising in
California.
   ``You can't break through in a state like California,'' Rath
said. ``If you're a Jimmy Carter or a Bob Dole running against the
quasi-incumbent figure, you need a place that's going to dent that
front-runner's armor. George McGovern did it in 1972 and Gary Hart
did it in 1984.''
   Robert Beckel, campaign manager for Democratic presidential
nominee Walter Mondale in 1984, also has said a California switch
would discourage long-shots and attract nationally well-known
candidates.
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown didn't go that
far. But in a recent visit to New Hampshire, he said the influence
of New Hampshire and Iowa was ``grossly overrated'' and praised
California's efforts to have its contest earlier.
   Beckel maintains that having the option of scoring a major
victory in California might make a candidate less inclined to sweat
it out in Iowa and New Hampshire.
   Rath dismissed the notion that candidates would campaign in
California on New Hampshire time.
   ``The week between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire
primary (in 1988) was probably the political Super Bowl of all time
in this state,'' he said. ``And California a week after won't
change anything.''
   New Hampshire, Rath said, ``is too riveted in the nation's
political consciousness.''
   Dayton Duncan, press secretary for Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis in the latter part of his 1988 campaign and a top Mondale
spokesman in 1984, agrees.
   ``Obviously, they'll have to spend a lot of time in California,
but it's too big a state to campaign intensively the way you can in
New Hampshire,'' he said. ``The best way for you to get a head
start in California is to do well in New Hampshire.''
   Duncan said California and Super Tuesday are too big to organize
at the grassroots level and too expensive to advertise in. The
shortest route to becoming known is to win the caucuses and
primaries before them, he said.
   Ron Kaufman, regional political director for George Bush's 1988
campaign, said an early California primary will go much the same
way as Super Tuesday. That was meant to diminish the impact of New
Hampshire and Iowa.
   But Kaufman, now a White House aide, said it had the opposite
effect.
   ``The biggest single thing that helped Michael Dukakis in Super
Tuesday was winning New Hampshire,'' Kaufman said.

legalizing drugs, says he's treading an unpopular path that no
politician wants to take, ``not for a minute.''
   Many of the leading drug legalization advocates aren't in
government posts, but some public officials put their careers on
the line by taking the unpopular stance or by calling for a close
look at the legalization argument long before Shultz stepped into
the controversy.
   Thus far, their ventures don't appear to have hurt their careers.
   Shultz's pronouncement last month contends the war on drugs is
futile.
   ``It seems to me we're not really going to get anywhere until we
can take the criminality out of the drug business and the
incentives for criminality out of it,'' he said in a column in The
Wall Street Journal, an adaptation of an earlier speech.
   ``Frankly, the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to
make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place
at a price that approximates their cost,'' he wrote. ``We need at
least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of
drugs.''
   The position drew hoots from White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   ``Whoa, he's been out on the West Coast too long, hasn't he? The
guy slips into retirement and right away he starts saying things
that are strange,'' Fitzwater said.
   National drug control strategy director William J. Bennett
called legalization ``a dopey idea'' and a ``moral disaster.''
   Shultz acknowledged that he was ``shouting into the breeze here
as far as what we're doing now.''
   ``No politician wants to say what I just said, not for a
minute.''
   The most prominent politician currently holding office who has
advocated some form of legalization is Baltimore Mayor Kurt
Schmoke, a former prosecutor who wants to change ``attitudes about
drug addiction from a crime problem to a public health problem.''
   But he's not alone.
   Other public officials who have supported legalization, or at
least a civil and in-depth discussion of the possibility, include
Hartford, Conn., Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry; Mercer County (N.J.)
Executive Bill Mathesius; Columbia (Mo.) Deputy Chief of Police
Carroll Highbarger; and New York State Sen. Joseph L. Galiber of
the Bronx.
   Their careers haven't collapsed.
   Perry, who testified before Congress last year that she supports
Schmoke's views, was just re-elected by a 2-1 margin over her
Republican opponent.
   Mathesius, a former federal and county prosecutor, was being
touted as a possible state attorney general if Rep. James Courter,
a Republican, had won the governorship. Courter, however, lost to
Democratic Rep. James J. Florio.
   Mathesius, whose county includes Trenton and who next faces the
voters in 1991, said public reaction to his pro-legalization stance
``has been running 20-1 in favor, among those who have taken the
time and trouble to write. I was surprised.''
   Highbarger was chief of detectives in Columbia when he started
calling for a study of legalization 1{ years ago. Since then, he's
been promoted to deputy chief of the department.
   Some legalization advocates say San Jose (Calif.) Police Chief
Joseph McNamara is in their camp, but he denies it.
   ``We've had 70 years of glorious failure and we really need to
look for different ways'' to deal with the drug problem, McNamara
said several years ago. The focus, he said, should be diverted
somewhat from law enforcement to increased prevention and treatment
efforts to reduce demand.
   ``I think it's a big jump from being critical to legalization,
especially when there are no definitions of what form legalization
will take,'' McNamara said in an interview.
   Bennett and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh have said that law
enforcement alone can't solve the problem. Bush's drug strategy
reflects those views in words, but McNamara noted that the
appropriations request still devotes the biggest bucks to law
enforcement.
   ``If this so-called war flops after three years, I think there
will be some massive changes in public policies ... and they'll be
forced to be open to other ideas'' such as legalization, McNamara
said.
   Highbarger says the problem with drug prohibition is that
``enforcement is simply not working.''
   ``We're pouring money down a rathole,'' he said in an interview.
``Drugs get cheaper every year. That tells you how good our
enforcement effort is.''
   Highbarger joked that the latest anti-drug program in Columbia _
a city of 70,000 in a metropolitan area of 125,000 where crack has
been the major problem _ is winter.
   ``At 35 degrees and a 35 mph wind, it's harder to stand out on
the street corner selling drugs,'' he said, laughing. ``That's our
current program, and it's working.''

   Backers of a shrine to the likes of Elvis
Presley, Little Richard and the Beatles are frantically trying to
drum up enough money to build the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and
Museum.
   Wednesday is the deadline for raising the $40 million needed to
build the structure, which would rise in downtown Cleveland near
the Cuyahoga River by 1992.
   Local promoters figure about 600,000 people would push through
the turnstiles of the pyramid-shaped, glass-and-steel complex each
year and spend $85 million in restaurants, hotels and souvenir
shops.
   Organizers canvassing corporate Cleveland for donations expect
to meet the fund-raising goal in cash and pledges, said the
project's development director, John Zoilo.
   ``It's gone through some rough stages. However, now it's on firm
financial footing,'' Zoilo said. ``We're confident we'll be there.
We're closing the gap every day.''
   As of Sunday, more than $37 million was collected in cash and
pledges from state, local and federal governments and from private
companies and philanthropists, said Larry Thompson, rock hall
director in Cleveland.
   Last week, a local nightclub and restaurant developer, Jeffrey
Jacobs, offered to chip in up to $500,000.
   Three years ago, Cleveland beat out seven other cities for the
project, sponsored by the New York-based Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Foundation, which also set the funding deadline.
   Since 1986, the foundation, comprised of recording industry
executives and artists' promoters and managers, has inducted
performers into a Hall of Fame, though the organization lacked a
building. Even after the hall is built, induction ceremonies
probably would remain in New York, said Suzan Evans, the
foundation's executive director.
   The Rust Belt city whose main claim to musical fame has been its
highly regarded symphony orchestra may seem an unlikely site to
honor rock 'n' roll. Its few native rockers include the Poni-Tails,
the Edsels, the Outsiders, the James Gang and the Raspberries.
   But promoters say Cleveland has earned Huey Lewis' accolade as
the ``heart of rock 'n' roll,'' noting the city's residents lead
the nation in per capita record purchases and have a history of
supporting rock music.
   The city's rock heyday was in the 1950s, when WJW-AM disc jockey
Alan Freed dubbed himself ``Moon Dog'' and began broadcasting his
nightly show.
   Boosters claim Cleveland was the scene of the first big rock
concert _ the Moon Dog Coronation Ball featuring the Dominoes, Earl
Bostwick and others _ for which promoters Freed and Leo Mintz sold
twice as many tickets as there were seats.
   When Cleveland was chosen as site for the hall, community
enthusiasm and pledges of support flowed. Even Mayor George
Voinovich, a Phil Collins fan, and Gov. Richard Celeste donned Hall
of Fame sweatshirts and campaigned for the project.
   But support sputtered. One local campaign that sought individual
donations of $15 or more produced only $300,000. The only rock
group to donate was The Who, which has promised about $1 million
from its concert tour this year, said Zoilo.
   Last month, a $6.9 million federal Urban Development Action
Grant, considered a key piece in the funding, fell through.
   Ms. Evans declined to say if the foundation would pull the plug
on the Cleveland hall if boosters don't raise $40 million.
   ``We're still very optimistic about Cleveland,'' she said.
``Their (financial) information will be analyzed.''
   Other cities that courted the project were San Francisco,
Chicago, Nashville, Philadelphia, New Orleans, New York and
Memphis, Tenn.
   Local economists said the project could do for Cleveland what
the Country Music Hall of Fame does for Nashville, Tenn., where
about 350,000 people a year pay $6.50 to stroll past banjoes,
spangled suits, recording equipment and other trade artifacts.

<HEAD>World Grain Production Linked to U.S. Output</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department analysis shows total
U.S. grain production is so huge that year-to-year changes in the
pattern send tremors throughout the world.
   When U.S. crop production falters, there is a good chance that
global figures also will show a decline. And when there are bumper
U.S. harvests, particularly of feed grains, the world stockpile is
fatter.
   Last week the USDA estimated this fall's corn harvest _ the
keystone of total U.S. grain output _ at 7.59 billion bushels, up
54 percent from the drought-savaged 1988 harvest.
   Put into international terms, the U.S. corn crop was 192.8
million metric tons. Allowing for about 2,205 pounds per ton, there
are approximately 39.4 bushels of corn in each ton _ or 36.7
bushels of wheat or soybeans.
   A related supply-and-demand report showed total U.S. grain
production this year at more than 283.8 million metric tons, which
includes corn output. That is up sharply from 204.1 million tons in
1988.
   The total includes wheat, coarse grains such as corn, sorghum,
oats and barley and milled rice. It does not include U.S. soybean
production, estimated at 52.7 million tons this year.
   According to the analysis, global production of grain in the
1989-90 year _ a composite of dates for various crops _ is
projected at about 1.671 billion tons, of which the U.S. share of
283.8 million would represent about 17 percent.
   Last year, when world grain output was 1.559 billion tons, the
U.S. share was 204.1 million, or 13 percent, which reflected the
drought reductions of 1988.
   After totaling all production and deducting how much grain will
be used in the year ahead, the USDA report said that by the end of
the current season in 1990 the world will have about 292.4 million
tons of grain left over.
   That would be down from 308.7 million tons left in the global
pantry this year and 403.9 million tons remaining in inventories in
1988.
   Of the total year-end grain stockpiles, the United States is
expected to have almost 74 million tons in 1990, or about 25
percent of the world total.
   This year, with a global inventory of 308.7 million tons of
grain, the United States accounted for 86 million tons, or 28
percent. And in 1988, with a world inventory of 403.9 million tons,
the U.S. share was 169.4 million tons _ 42 percent of the world's
total.
   As the figures show, the United States has borne the brunt of
grain stockpile reduction, while inventories in other countries
have dropped only slightly.
   This year, for example, the global reduction in year-end stocks
from 1988 was about 95.2 million tons. The United States accounted
for 85.4 million tons of the year-to-year decline.
   If the 1990 projection holds true, there will be a further
global reduction of 16.3 million tons, with the United States
accounting for 12 million.
   Thus, for the moment, at least, the major burden of holding
surplus grain inventories has been shifted from the United States
to other countries. How that stacks up a year or two from now will
depend on the weather and farmers' reactions to market developments.
   It will also depend on trade policies that affect exports and
domestic consumption of grains in scores of countries that buy from
American farmers or compete with them for export markets.

   The Agriculture Department says plans are
being made for agricultural trade and development missions to
Pakistan and Bangladesh.
   Undersecretary Richard Crowder said a mission also will be sent
to India, which had been visited earlier under trade mission
program. No dates have been set, he said.
   ``These three South Asian countries imported $1 billion worth of
U.S. agricultural products last year,'' Crowder said in his recent
announcement.
   ``In addition, Pakistan and Bangladesh are two of our largest
food aid recipients. These missions offer an excellent opportunity
to review all U.S. trade and development programs and make
recommendations for improved coordination with the three
countries.''
   The missions will include representatives from the departments
of Agriculture and State, and the U.S. Agency for International
Development. Three to six private representatives also will be
selected for each team.
   Congress authorized the missions program two years ago to
encourage greater U.S. private sector and foreign country
participation in U.S. agricultural trade and development
activities. Sixteen countries have been visited or are planned
under the program.

   The Agriculture Department is asking for
public comments on procedures used to set government support prices
for ``pulled'' wool and mohair for the 1990 marketing year.
   Under current law, the support for pulled wool taken from
slaughtered lambs must be set a level relative to the support for
shorn wool from live sheep. In the past, this has been carried out
through payments based on the weight of live, unshorn lambs
marketed.
   The support for mohair, which is clipped from goats, also is
based on the comparable level for shorn wool.
   And the support for shorn wool is derived under a formula
prescribed in the law. Based on current readings, the 1990 support
for shorn wool will be $1.82 per pound, compared with $1.77 this
year.
   Comments may be sent by Dec. 26 to: Director, Commodity Analysis
Division, USDA-ASCS, Room 3741-S, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, D.C.
20013. More information may be obtained by calling 202-447-6734.

<HEAD>Conn. State Police Commander Resigns Over Taping of Phone Calls</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state's top police officer resigned
under fire over secret taping of prisoners' telephone calls that
defense attorneys say could be grounds for retrial of criminal
cases as far back as 1980.
   The taping ``should not have been done, was wrong and cannot be
tolerated,'' Gov. William A. O'Neill said Sunday in announcing the
resignation of Cmdr. Lester J. Forst.
   ``Do I believe it was done with intent and malice aforethought?
The answer to that is probably not. ...
   ``I felt that I had ... responsibility to make sure that the
people in the state of Connecticut have total trust in the state
police department and certainly that their rights are protected.''
   Forst's resignation as state police commander and public saftey
commissioner came less than a week after it was revealed that
officers recorded all incoming and outgoing calls at the 12
regional state police barracks.
   The taping may have started nine years ago, attorneys said.
   In a four-sentence letter to the governor, the 54-year-old Forst
described his departure after eight years in the $81,000-a-year job
as a resignation. He denied violating any laws and said he was
unaware of the taping.
   O'Neill named former Hartford Police Chief Bernard R. Sullivan,
46, to replace Forst. Sullivan has been security director for The
Hartford insurance company since July.
   The governor ordered an halt to taping of attorney-client calls.
   After the taping was reported last week by The Hartford Courant,
a defense lawyers' organization filed a class-action lawsuit
contending that police could have illegally gathered evidence from
tapes of attorney-client calls. If that is proven, prosecutions
could be endangered, the lawyers said in announcing the federal
suit seeking money damages for those whose conversations were taped.
   ``I would think that pending cases are subject to dismissal and
that convictions are likely to be overturned,'' said Margaret Levy,
a defense attorney.
   Joseph Keefe, president of the Connecticut Criminal Defense
Lawyers' Association, predicted it is unlikely a conviction would
be overturned unless illegally obtained information led to the
conviction.
   State police officials have said calls were taped so officers
would have a record of difficult-to-understand emergency calls and
as a record in case callers complained about the way they were
handled.
   The governor's legal counsel, the attorney general and the chief
state's attorney are examining state police taping policies, as
well as those at local police departments. In addition, the U.S.
attorney for Connecticut and the FBI are investigating whether the
taping violated federal wiretap laws.
   In his resignation letter, Forst said, ``I have not violated any
laws nor have I condoned any wrongdoing. However, it has been my
training for over 27 years to serve the best interests of the state
of Connecticut and the Department of Public Safety.''

   Abortion-rights activists are pledging to
channel their energy from last week's election victories into 1990
political campaigns to assure that women continue to have freedom
of choice.
   ``This will be the issue of 1990,'' Molly Yard, president of the
National Organization for Women, told more than 150,000
abortion-rights activists who rallied Sunday in the nation's
capital.
   The Washington gathering was the largest in a string of
pro-choice rallies and other events held nationwide Sunday.
   ``Anti-choice is our Berlin Wall, and together, we will make it
fall forever,'' author and activist Gloria Steinem told about 1,300
people in Atlanta.
   In Washington, pro-choice Democratic and Republican politicians
joined a parade of entertainers to lead a nearly five-hour rally on
a sunny, mild autumn day. The crowd of demonstrators, waving signs
and shouting pro-choice slogans, stretched from the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial, along the Reflecting Pool to the Washington
Monument.
   Galvanized by election victories for pro-choice candidates
earlier this month in Virginia and New Jersey, demonstrators were
encouraged that politicians wouldn't be able to ignore them in the
next round of elections.
   ``I urge all of you to turn up the heat across the nation,''
said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who said a bill would be
introduced in Congress later this year to prohibit states from
interfering with women's right to abortion.
   He and other pro-choice lawmakers from Capitol Hill and
statehouses across the country urged activists to work for
candidates who pledge to preserve abortion rights for women.
   ``The action is in the states, and we are on board there and
ready,'' said Iowa Lt. Gov. Joann Zimmerman, a Democrat running for
governor. ``We will fight to see that we have pro-choice candidates.
   There are 34 Senate seats and 36 governor's offices up for
election next year.
   Rally organizers said the police count of 150,000 attending the
rally was low, estimating the crowd at twice that number. Among the
celebrities at the rally were singers Helen Reddy, Pete Seeger,
Peter Yarrow and Mary Travers and actress Ruby Dee.
   About 30 anti-abortion demonstrators gathered near the Lincoln
Memorial in an area roped off from the pro-choice demonstrators. A
few carried signs and one demonstrator used a megaphone to address
abortion-rights activists, who drowned him out with their own
``pro-choice'' chants.
   Across the country, thousands of other pro-choice activists
gathered at similar rallies and other events, including a sunrise
service in Kennebunk, Maine, near President Bush's vacation retreat.
   An abortion-rights demonstration in April drew hundreds of
thousands _ 300,000 by police estimates and 600,000 by the
organizers' count _ to the capital in anticipation of a Supreme
Court ruling in a Missouri abortion case.
   Soon after, the court gave broad authority to states to restrict
women's rights to terminate their pregnancies, though it left
intact its landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   The court will hear three cases later this month and in December
seeking to further restrict a woman's right to abortion.
   ``The Supreme Court did us a great favor,'' said Mary Ann Baker
of Youngstown, Ohio. ``It got us off our complacent behinds.''

   At 55, East Berliner Hedda Zenter plans to apply
for her first passport. It may never take her any further than
another day trip to West Berlin, but it will mark the end of nearly
30 years of frustrated hopes.
   ``My dream is to see Paris, to buy an English newspaper,'' said
Mrs. Zenter. ``But to be here, that too was unbelievable.''
   Mrs. Zenter was one of about 1 million East Germans who took
their first chance Sunday to pass freely to the Western side of her
city.
   She visited the gravesites of departed friends, strolled through
the zoo, stopping to nibble a sandwich brought in her bag, then
crowded with thousands of others for a glimpse of West German
President Richard von Weizsaecker outside West Berlin's historic
Gedaechtniskirche, the memorial church.
   With no immediate relatives in West Berlin, Mrs. Zedda is among
millions of East Germans for whom the Berlin Wall was impenetrable.
   Applications to visit an elderly cousin last seen a few weeks
before the Wall went up in 1961 were repeatedly turned down by the
East German authorities who say a cousin does not qualify as a
close relation.
   Before East Germany scrapped travel restrictions last week,
family ties were one of the few grounds for applying to make a trip.
   Mrs. Zenter will never see her cousin now. He died six months
ago.
   The prospects of seeing Paris are also remote.
   A university-trained physical education teacher, now working as
a therapist at a clinic in East Berlin, Mrs. Zenter earns 840 East
German marks a month.
   At the exchange rate set by East Germany, that's about $450 a
month. At the unofficial rate that reflects its actual worth, the
sum is about $45.
   As for many others, the Communist government's momentous
political change of heart may have come too late for Mrs. Zenter.
   ``The thirty years that have gone were the prime of my life,''
she said. ``I wouldn't try to live outside East Germany now, I have
a house, my daughter is there, my job is there. These are the
things that tie. But I can, perhaps, travel.''
   That will need another revolution, a transformed East German
economy, to turn her earnings into hard currency.
   But Mrs. Zenter still has hopes. For nearly a decade, she has
studied English at home, listening to British Broadcasting Corp.
programs.
   On Sunday, she'd had her first chance to try it out on a native
English-speaker. ``You understand me? That's marvellous,'' she told
a reporter.
   For years too, she's been writing to a pen pal in Canada in
English.
   Most of the friend's replies never reached her. Now she thinks
the authorities will stop interfering with the mail.
   And if she never goes any further, walking through a checkpoint
in the Berlin Wall after simply waving an identify card at East
German border guards spelled freedom.
   ``I feel much freer,'' she said. ``Everything has changed, and
the change came from the bottom, from the people and it was hard
and bitterly fought for.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III prepares
to call for a decisive hemispheric stand against Panama's Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega as foreign ministers from the Organization
of American States gather here today.
   A highlight of the meeting is expected to be the admission of
Canada as the 32nd OAS member, effective Jan. 1. There also is some
sentiment in support of readmitting Cuba.
   The OAS expelled the government of president Fidel Castro in
1962 on grounds that the country's Marxist-Leninist philosophy is
incompatible with OAS principles.
   OAS foreign ministers usually convene only once a year, but the
Panama crisis has prompted four special OAS sessions since May. An
OAS commission appointed in May was unable to fulfill its mandate
of arranging a democratic transfer of power in Panama.
   U.S. officials said Baker was expected to deliver a tough speech
condemning the Panamanian government, but it was not clear whether
he would make specific proposals.
   The inaugural session was scheduled for this morning, and
Baker's remarks were to be delivered in late afternoon.
   The Panama crisis arose six months ago when Panamanian
authorities threw out the returns from national elections amid
widespread allegations of fraud. A Noriega crony, Francisco
Rodriguez, was sworn in Sept. 1 as the unelected president.
   The United States has been the strongest proponent of decisive
action against Noriega, but other OAS countries maintain that the
group should stay out of what is an essentially internal Panamanian
matter.
   Also on the OAS agenda is Nicaragua's scheduled Feb. 25
presidential election. The meeting is expected to produce numerous
calls for a free and fair election process.
   Cuba has been sharply critical of the OAS over the years,
looking on the organization as an instrument of U.S. foreign
policy. But seven leading Latin American democracies called last
month for Cuba's readmission to the OAS and Cuba has said it's
ready to accept.
   Cuba has far more diplomatic support in the hemisphere than at
any time since it was expelled from the OAS 27 years ago.
   The United States has lobbied hard against Cuba's readmission,
citing alleged Cuban support for subversion in Central American and
reported human rights abuses.
   Cuba's readmission would require a two-thirds vote of member
nations in attendance.

   Peter Fechter was 18 when he was gunned down by
East German border guards at the Berlin Wall and left to die. With
the Wall now crumbling 27 years later, his mother says he did not
die in vain.
   At the time, his ordeal became a symbol of the cruelty of the
Berlin Wall and the people who guarded it.
   Margarethe Fechter remembers her only son as a fun-loving hard
worker, engaged to be married. A yellowed black-and-white
photograph of him still hangs in her cramped apartment in East
Berlin's Weissensee district.
   Fechter was among the first of at least 80 victims killed along
the barrier Communist East Germany began erecting Aug. 13, 1961 to
isolate its part of the former German capital and keep its citizens
from fleeing to the West.
   His was among the most horrifying of deaths at the Wall.
   ``It was senseless,'' his 78-year-old mother said amid the 1950s
furnishings of her apartment, where her son had lived.
   On Aug. 17, 1962, Fechter was part of a work detachment
reinforcing a stretch of the Wall.
   ``I was always there cooking meals,'' his mother, a widowed
seamstress, recalled in an interview. ``They used to sit on top of
the wall, laughing and joking.''
   One day, while they were sitting on the Wall, a woman went to
her balcony in an East Berlin building overlooking the construction
site, his mother said. Two armed border guards had a watchpost in
the same house.
   ``She shouted to them, `Are you daydreaming up there? Can't you
see there are two pigs trying to flee over there?''' Mrs. Fechter
said.
   Struck by a machine-gun volley, Fechter fell to the East German
side of the Wall. He was ignored for 50 minutes and bled to death,
too weak to pick up bandages thrown over by West German police.
   Border guards later dragged him away by his feet.
   ``They left him lying there; they let him bleed to death,'' his
mother says. ``They wouldn't let us get near him.
   ``It was gruesome. He kept on crying, `Mommy, Mommy.' They
treated him like cattle.''
   The man believed to have fired the deadly shots emerged from the
building after two hours. He was attacked by bystanders.
   ``He was screaming he wasn't it. But everybody saw he did it,''
says Mrs. Fechter.
   ``I didn't know how to tell my husband,'' she continued. ``He
cried like a child. Seven weeks later, I was attending his funeral
too.''
   Now, East Germans suddenly can travel freely to the West and new
crossings are being opened in the Wall.
   Says Magarethe Fechter: ``Those who died helped bring this
about.''
   West Berlin police have registered 80 deaths, including 61
shootings by East German authorities, since the Wall went up. The
actual toll is believed to be higher.
   More than 5,000 East Germans successfully escaped across the
Wall. About 3,300 would-be escapees were arrested, according to
West Berlin police.
   Guenter Litfin, a young East Berliner, became the first victim
on Aug. 21, 1961. He was shot trying to swim to the West Berlin
side of the Spree River after climbing over the Wall.
   The last victim was Winfried Freudenberg, who apparently fell to
his death from a homemade hot-air balloon after reaching West
Berlin territory on March 8. Chris Gueffroy, a 20-year-old East
Berlin waiter, was the last one shot while fleeing. He was killed
Feb. 5.
   There were also spectacular escapes as the urge to flee
sometimes triggered desperate ingenuity.
   Twice in 1963, Westerners brought out girlfriends by driving
low-slung speedsters under the barriers at Berlin checkpoints. The
East Germans later installed vertical bars to stop such escapes.
   Fifty-seven people fled in 1964 through a 145-yard tunnel that
emerged in an unused West Berlin bakery.

<HEAD>Federal Lawsuit Tests `Nuclear-Free Zone' Movement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``nuclear-free zone'' movement has been
trying for a decade to be taken seriously. Now it has some evidence
of success _ a lawsuit by the federal government.
   The Bush administration seeks to overturn major portions of
Oakland's 1988 nuclear-free initiative that could affect a Navy
base, a Department of Energy office and other federal installations.
   It was the first government lawsuit against any of the more than
160 measures passed around the nation during the last decade
declaring in varying terms that nuclear weapons were unwelcome
within their jurisdictions.
   Most of the measures are symbolic, either by design or by
location in a place without nuclear connections. The trend in
recent years has been toward more specific and binding proposals,
which have occasionally provoked opposition from potentially
affected local businesses.
   In case involving the federal lawsuit, there is a good chance
the government will succeed at least partially.
   At issue is an Oakland ordinance that can be interpreted as
asserting local authority over a variety of decisions affecting
nuclear weapons, an area in which courts have given the federal
government much power.
   The provisions are broad and mandatory. It was passed in a city
of 350,000 that is home to a Navy supply center for the Pacific
Fleet and a Department of Energy office that oversees nuclear
weapons research at nearby Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Also,
many other area military bases ship materials through Oakland.
   Passed by voter initiative in November 1988, the measure:
   _ Forbids all ``nuclear weapons work,'' including research,
production or storage of weapons or their components, after
November 1990.
   _ Requires any shipment of radioactive material through Oakland
to be disclosed in advance to the city, which would choose the
safest routes.
   _ Prohibits the city from contracting with, or investing in, any
nuclear weapons-makers, unless no reasonable alternatives exist.
   The contracting and investment provisions, borrowed from the
anti-apartheid movement, are the key to the measure, said Wilson
Riles Jr., the only City Council member to support the initiative
before it passed.
   He said they already have led the city to reduce substantially
its investments in federal treasury bills and offer a promising
model to other communities.
   Riles said he believed the two provisions were on firm legal
ground, because similar bans on South African products have been
upheld in court.
   ``Oakland is at a critical point in this new turn in the peace
movement,'' he said. ``The federal government has realized this and
I think that's why they're trying to stop it.''
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said the U.S. Dostrict
Court lawsuit, filed in September on behalf of the Navy and Engery
Department, was intended to respond to a unique local problem, not
to stop a movement or send a message to other jurisdictions.
   The lawsuit contends the ordinance interferes with the
government's exclusive authority over national defense and nuclear
energy, creates undue burdens on interstate commerce, and conflicts
with laws on military secrecy and shipments of hazardous materials.
   So far, the city has tried to avoid, or at least minimize, any
confrontation.
   The City Council passed a resolution saying the investment ban
did not apply to pensions, the restrictions on transportation did
not cover state or federal highways, and the disclosure
requirements did not apply to military secrets.
   But the city is standing firm on the bottom-line issue of local
authority.
   ``We do feel we have the authority to regulate what goes through
our city streets, to determine who we want to contract with ...
getting some control over what happens in our city,'' said City
Attorney Jayne Williams.
   ``We don't have the power to change national priorities,'' added
Riles. ``But as individuals and as a collection of individuals in a
free democracy we have the right in peacetime to decide where our
resources will be spent and what happens in our communities.''

   Federal support for the nation's 24 tribally
controlled colleges has steadily dwindled during the 1980s and is
now ``woefully insufficient,'' according to a study.
   Many such colleges, serving about 4,400 reservation Indians,
``are forced to carry on their work in trailers and abandoned
government buildings that other colleges would have hauled away or
bulldozed over 20 years ago,'' the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching concluded in a report released Sunday.
   ``Such poor facilities not only restrict learning, but also make
a powerful statement of neglect,'' said the report, ``Tribal
Colleges: Shaping the Future of Native Americans.''
   The report by Paul Boyer, a journalism instructor at California
State University at Sacramento, is the first study of tribal
colleges, which appeared 21 years ago at the height of the
civil-rights movement.
   Tribal colleges today suffer from low faculty salaries, a high
teacher turnover rate and poorly equipped libraries and other
facilities, largely because Washington has consistently failed to
provide all the funds it had promised, Boyer wrote.
   Nevertheless, tribal colleges quickly have become pillars of
strength and hope for the Indian community, providing social and
economic counseling and giving students who dropped out of
mainstream colleges a second chance in a more nurturing
environment, the report said.
   Eighty-six percent of tribal college students who transfer to
mainstream colleges complete their education. In contrast, the
approximately 90,000 students who start college in non-Indian
schools have a 90 percent dropout rate.
   The oldest and largest, Navajo Community College in Tsaile,
Ariz., was founded in 1968 and enrolls more than 1,000 students.
The others are in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, California,
Oregon, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and elsewhere in
Arizona. Nearly all are two-year colleges.
   According to the report, the federal government has had a policy
of ``benign neglect'' toward these institutions. The report also
called on states and private foundations to help the colleges.

   Some private groups are helping. In Washington today, the
MacArthur Foundation announced a $5.7 million grant to help improve
educational and economic opportunities for Indians, including $3
million to 18 tribally-controlled colleges.
   ``American Indians are among the nation's poorest citizens, yet
their welfare generally has been overlooked by private
foundations,'' said Adele Simmons, foundation president.
   ``A small amount of money goes a long way at the tribal
colleges, and this new support is a real morale booster,'' said
Janine Windy-Boy, president of Little Big Horn College in Crow
Agency, Mont.
   U.S. West, another private foundation, announced plans to send
tribal college presidents for a training program at Harvard
University's Institute of Educational Management.

   Eleven years ago, Congress authorized $4,000 for each full-time
equivalent student at tribal colleges, later raising it to $5,825.
But actual appropriations never approached those figures, the
report said.
   It said that in 1980, when there were only about 1,700 students
in tribal colleges, the federal government distributed $5 million _
about $3,000 per student _ under the Tribally Controlled Community
College Act.
   By 1989, with enrollments up nearly threefold, ``the
appropriation climbed to $8.5 million, but the amount generated for
each student declined to $1,900. In effect, tribal colleges are
being penalized for their own success,'' the study said.
   Twelve of the colleges are fully accredited and eight are
candidates for accreditation, according to the report.
   ``Clearly, tribal colleges are not marginal institutions that
have been `given a break,''' it said.
   Unlike past education efforts that have frequently encouraged
Indians to deny their heritage, a central mission of tribal
colleges has been to help tribes ``reclaim their cultural
heritage,'' wrote foundation president Ernest L. Boyer in a
foreword to the study.
   Since their beginnings, many have offered tutoring programs in
building basic skills and provide active counseling.
   Typical students are over age 30, female, and nearly all live on
reservations. Many attend tribal colleges after failing at
traditional colleges.
   College presidents are nearly all Indians, and all are chartered
and controlled by tribal advisory and governing boards.
   But most faculty are non-Indian, and low pay and isolation have
led to a high turnover, the report said.

   Egon Krenz's gamble that an open door policy would
not backfire has paid off. All but a few of the millions of East
Germans who flooded West Germany over the weekend returned home.
   In charge of a faltering economy and a government under siege by
calls for democracy, East Germany's new Communist leader created a
safety valve by opening the doors to the West. The lack of freedom
to travel to the West has been among the most bitter complaints of
East Germans.
   More importantly, Krenz bought time for the political and
economic reforms he has promised by boosting his credibility with
East Germans who had doubted the sincerity of his pledges.
   Guenter Schabowski, a member of the ruling Politburo and East
Berlin's Communist Party chief, said the border opening proved the
East German leadership was serious and decisive about reforms.
   ``The needs of the people were clear to us and we knew that the
decision entailed risks,'' the state-run news agency ADN quoted
Schabowski as saying. He said he never feared the situation would
get out of control, that trust had been won back.
   ADN reported that East German officials had issued nearly 4.3
million visas for travel to the West between Thursday and late
Sunday.
   West German officials said that of the more than 3 million East
Germans who poured in over the weekend, only about 2 percent opted
to remain under laws that guarantee automatic citizenship to East
Germans.
   Krenz's hand was forced by a combined challenge: the flight of
200,000 East Germans this year and massive street protests
demanding reform.
   To stem the flight of East Germany's youngest and most talented
workers, Krenz opened locked doors that had done much to fuel the
exodus West.
   In doing so, he has also taken the pressure off Czechoslovakia,
which had reluctantly become a conduit for tens of thousands of
East German refugees who poured over its frontiers to the West in
recent weeks.
   Prague's orthodox Communist leaders have refused to join East
Germany, Hungary and Poland in endorsing democratic change.
   Krenz gambled that a look at West Germany's glittering economy
would not permanently lure most East Germans into deserting their
homes and jobs.
   The weekend's visitors to the West went on a spending spree for
fresh fruit and electronic gadgetry scarce back home, then went
back across the border.
   The fallout from the massive influx to West Germany is likely to
increase pressure on the East German government to improve its
people's standard of living, already the envy of many Warsaw Pact
neighbors.

   A bicycle racer pedaled a
helicopter into the air in the first successful flight of a
human-powered chopper, according to university students who worked
on the project.
   ``It's probably the last great aviation achievement around,''
said Neal Saiki, 23, a senior at the California State Polytechnic
University, San Luis Obispo, after Sunday's indoor test flight.
   As cheers filled Mott Gymnasium, the 100-pound copter, known as
the Da Vinci III, hovered a few inches above the floor under the
power of cyclist Greg McNeil, an aeronautical engineering major who
races on the U.S. cycling team.
   The Da Vinci III, with a single 100-foot blade, is the fourth
helicopter to be built by Cal Poly students since 1981. The last
version, the Da Vinci IIb, was damaged in May.
   The helicopters are named after Leonardo da Vinci because he
sketched a similar craft, university spokesman Bob Anderson said.
   Human-powered planes have flown, but not helicopters, the
students said.
   The helicopter has a single 100-foot blade, resting above the
cockpit where the pedaler sits. The seat and pedals swing freely in
the center section, rather than rest on the floor like previous
models.
   Saiki, who has worked on the project for more than two years,
said three improvements contributed to the success of the latest
version.
   ``We made it lighter, we made the rotors straighter and we got a
pilot with a better output,'' Saiki said.
   But Saiki conceded that people of the future will not pedal
about in their own helicopters, at least not copters like this one.
``It's far too big to ever be popular,'' he said. ``I mean, it
fills up the gym practically wall to wall.''

   A package that sounded like a time bomb and
looked like a bomb on X-rays turned out to be ``a rather cute
witch,'' probably made for Halloween, an airport official said.
   ``We're calling it our trick-or-treat case,'' said Port of
Seattle Police Chief Ed Ingram. ``We got the trick. We really did.''
   Ingram said a ``strange, electronic sound'' coming from the
package, sent by priority mail from Juneau, Alaska, to an air base
in Massachusetts, aroused the suspicion Friday of an airline
employee at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   A technician's X-rays revealed what looked like a detonator, so
the package was taken to a bunker and blasted with a water cannon
to disarm it.
   When the box was opened, though, police found a battered witch
doll rigged with light bulbs and other electronics.
   The parcel was rewrapped and sent on its way with a note of
explanation, said Ed Bordenet of the Postal Inspection Service,
refusing to name the sender or addressee.

   The biggest attraction at Detroit's Adult Toys
Expo wasn't the $260,000 Ferrari Testarossa or a booth filled with
furs. It appeared to be Chester Nairne's Marvelle Gourmet Cookware.
   Cookware? At a toy show?
   ``There's an awful lot of people that cook for pleasure,''
Nairne said after about a dozen people watched him demonstrate his
no-stick goods this weekend.
   ``Now to me, a $250,000 automobile is certainly not a toy,''
said Nairne, a microphone clipped to his collar to amplify his
sales pitch over the din at Detroit's Cobo Hall.
   Other ``toys'' included a newfangled stepladder, home alarm
systems, a sponge-action cloth called the Super Shammy and Lionel
trains, along with Ferrari and Lamborghini cars, hot tubs, saunas,
boats and jewelry.
   ``There should have been more sport toys, not a guy selling pots
and pans. That's not toys,'' said Paul Wojtylko of Gibraltar.
``They could have had more things you don't see everyday.''
   For Lee and Birgit Bowring of Plymouth the question wasn't
whether they wanted any of the opulent items, including the furs
they were admiring.
   ``The question is the money,'' Bowring said, swearing that they
came just to look. ``Hopefully we won't buy,'' said Ms. Bowring,
pausing to look at her husband before adding, ``Unless it's a fur
maybe.''

   Lech Walesa, a prophet of Soviet Bloc reform,
heads for a hero's welcome in Washington today as Europe echoes
with the sound of sledgehammers against the Berlin Wall.
   Walesa arrives with his head high and his hand out, applauded
for forging the first non-Communist government in the Warsaw Pact
and seeking money for its survival.
   ``We are building an America of the East,'' but that requires
billions of dollars from the West, Walesa said in an interview
before leaving Poland.
   Walesa's visit will give President Bush and Congress a chance to
applaud in decibels and dollars the changes that are sweeping the
Soviet bloc, and that led last week to the opening of the Berlin
Wall.
   There will be plenty of praise in Washington for the mustachioed
electrician who rocketed to world fame in August 1980 by clambering
over another wall, that around the Gdansk shipyard, where he led
the strike that forged Solidarity, the first independent trade
union in the Communist bloc.
   Walesa is not likely to leave Washington empty-handed, as
Congress and the administration hammer out a deal to send up to
$989 million over three years to bolster the sweeping reforms
enacted in Poland and Hungary.
   After leaving Poland last Friday, Walesa's first stop was
Canada. Speaking Sunday at a dinner hosted by Bob White, president
of the Canadian Auto Workers union, Walesa said that if the West
doesn't enthusiastically support Poland's program for economic
recovery, it risks a brutal crackdown on political reforms sweeping
Eastern Europe.
   The bloody method used to crush the reform movement in China
earlier this year ``is an excellent example of what could happen
when the economic and political reforms do not go hand in hand,''
Walesa said.
   Walesa was to meet today with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
Then he was to fly to Washington to attend a White House reception
tonight, address an AFL-CIO convention and become the first private
foreign citizen in 175 years to address a joint meeting of Congress.
   Before heading home, Walesa also was to visit New York, Chicago,
Philadelphia and Caracas, Venezuela.
   Walesa, the Pole best known in the West, holds no government
post, preferring to remain head of the trade union he helped
create, steer through the repression of martial law and guide to
control of the government.
   The only previous foreigner without a government job to address
Congress was the Marquis de Lafayette, who fought as a general in
the American Revolution and spoke to a joint meeting in 1824, said
Ray Smock, the House historian.
   All the official hoopla could be old hat for a man who won the
Nobel Prize for Peace in 1983, but Walesa said on the eve of his
visit that one of his big worries was not having time for all the
Americans who want to meet him.
   ``I cannot thank Americans enough, because it is physically
impossible,'' Walesa told The Associated Press in an interview last
week in Gdansk. ``Any trip to the states shorter than one month is
no good.''
   Uppermost in Walesa's mind was the survival of the Solidarity
government, headed by his former adviser, Tadeusz Mazowecki.
   To bolster that government, Walesa said, ``we need Columbuses
from the states ... to discover Poland, to clear the trail.''
   ``Then there will be an influx of millionaires, because there is
business to be done there,'' said Walesa, describing a Poland in
need of rebuilding from top to bottom.
   U.S. aid is forthcoming, but it may not be as much as Walesa
would like.
   House and Senate negotiators a week ago completed work on a
compromise to send $533 million in fiscal 1990 to Poland and
Hungary, including a $200 million U.S. contribution to a $1 billion
international aid fund to help stabilize the Polish currency, as
well as money for a $45 million program to promote private
enterprise in Poland.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters turned out in large numbers for
municipal elections despite threats of violence from Maoist rebels,
and spurned candidates of President Alan Garcia's party, unofficial
returns showed today.
   Shining Path guerrillas trying to thwart Sunday's balloting
killed a candidate and blew up a church, a school and power lines.
Six other people were killed in attacks blamed on the rebels.
   No overall figures were available, but turnout was high in Lima
and other major cities. In the capital, authorities extended voting
for two hours to accommodate lines.
   Early results from a few mountainous rebel strongholds did
suggest some voters were frightened by rumored rebel threats to cut
off the index fingers, marked with indelible ink at polling
stations, of people who voted.
   In Ayacucho, 240 miles southeast of Lima, 68 percent of the
votes cast were blank, according to unofficial returns.
   Soldiers armed with assault rifles patrolled the streets. Armed
police and soldiers also provided heavy security at voting places.
   Political independent Ricardo Belmont won the mayoral race in
Lima with nearly 49 percent of the votes, according to the returns,
defeating the Democratic Front's Juan Inchaustegui, runner-up with
21.5 percent.
   The Democratic Front is the center-right coalition backing
novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in April's presidential elections and
it was challenged in most of the municipal races by the United
Left, a Marxist-led alliance.
   Sunday's voting was seen, first as a trial of whether the
government could put on an election amid a rising tide of rebel
violence.
   It was also considered a bellwether of the appeal of Vargas
Llosa, the presidential front-runner, as well as a gauge of just
how unpopular Garcia's center-left Aprista party has become.
   Vargas Llosa called the vote ``very important to the future of
our country ... to demonstrate that Peruvians do not fear the
extremist minorities that want to destroy our democracy.''
   More than 130 mayors, local judges, clerks, council members and
municipal candidates have been slain by the rebels so far this
year, and hundreds more have resigned out of fear.
   Vargas Llosa sought to play down Inchaustegui's defeat in the
capital, saying Belmont's victory signaled ``a desire for change
that is being profoundly felt from one end of the country to the
other.''
   With Peru suffering from 3,000 percent annual inflation and
economic chaos, Aprista candidates had been given little chance of
winning many mayoral races.
   Vargas Llosa entered the political fray after Garcia tried in
1987 to nationalize all the country's financial institutions, a
move that seriously cost the once popular president.
   A television exit poll Sunday showed Vargas Llosa would capture
55 percent of the vote if presidential elections were held
immediately. No other candidate got more than 14 percent support in
the poll.
   The novelist applauded the victories of Democratic Front
candidates in towns and provinces torn by guerrilla violence.
   Unofficial returns from outside the capital, where nearly a
third of the impoverished nation's 21 million people live, showed a
clear repudiation of Aprista. Candidates of the Democratic Front
appeared to take most of the seats.
   About 10 million Peruvians were registered to vote. Peru has
1,947 municipalities, but election authorities said there were no
candidates in at least 86 towns due to rebel death threats.
   Election officials in Huancayo, 140 miles east of Lima, counted
ballots by candlelight Sunday night after guerrillas blew up power
pylons, causing a blackout. Police reports from the city said
rebels set off a series of dynamite charges in the city shortly
after the blackout began.
   Reporters said gunfire could be heard throughout the city, which
has been under a nighttime curfew since Friday.
   Early Sunday, the rebels dynamited a church and a school in the
city.
   The attacks followed more than 20 explosions around the city
Saturday night intended to disrupt the voting as the first stage in
their campaign to block the presidential election.
   Police said a young man and young woman were electrocuted by
falling power lines Sunday when a power pylon was blown up 12 miles
north of Huancayo.
   They also said four people were killed and three wounded when
one of the victims stepped on a mine a few miles north of Huancayo
as they were returning home from voting. The mine was presumably
set by the rebels.
   Authorities said Shining Path guerrillas shot and killed the
Aprista mayoral candidate early Sunday in Azangaro, near the
Bolivian border 470 miles southeast of Lima.

<HEAD>Craig Spence Sent Farewell Message to Friends, Left Suicide Note.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Craig Spence, the former lobbyist linked to a
homosexual prostitution service who was found dead in a Boston
hotel room Friday, sent a taped farewell message to friends and
left a suicide note scrawled on a mirror, according to published
reports.
   ``Chief, consider this my resignation, effective immediately,''
read the message written in black felt-tip marker on a mirror of
his room at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, according to a story published
in today's editions of The Washington Times. ``As you always said,
you can't ask others to make a sacrifice if you're not ready to do
the same. Life is Duty. God bless America.''
   As a postscript, Spence wrote, ``To the Ritz, please forgive
this inconvenience,'' The Times reported.
   The Washington Post reported that it had obtained a copy of the
seven-minute ``video postcard'' Spence had sent to about a dozen
friends.
   ``Take heart, good friends,'' Spence said in the video, made two
weeks before his death. ``The pressures on us over the past several
years have been, let us say, significant.''
   Spence's body, dressed in a black tuxedo and white suspenders,
was found lying on a bed in the hotel room Friday, The Post
reported, citing police and an unidentified friend of Spence's. The
king-sized bed blocked the door.
   Spence's birth certificate and will also were found, both papers
reported. Detective Sgt. James McDonald told The Times that
investigators discovered seven small packets of a prescription
antidepressant hidden in a false ceiling in the hotel bathroom.
   An autopsy was done Saturday but the cause of death could not be
determined until toxicology tests are completed in a couple weeks,
said a spokesman for the Boston coroner's office.
   Spence reportedly took male prostitutes on a midnight tour of
the White House in July 1988. He was under investigation by police
and the Secret Service for possible credit card fraud in connection
with a male prostitution service, and had been subpoenaed to appear
before a federal grand jury.

<NOTE>Administration Officials Say New Soviet Weapons Deployment</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top administration officials say the Kremlin
is continuing to deploy new strategic nuclear weapons, although a
published report said some deployments had been cut in anticipation
of an arms control deal.
   ``The fact of the matter is the Soviets have continued to
modernize their strategic forces,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday.
   Cheney did not flatly deny a Washington Post report quoting
unidentified government sources as saying the Soviets had stopped
producing four new weapons, the SS-18 and SS-24 missile, the
Blackjack Bomber and the Typhoon submarine, and had suspended work
on an aircraft carrier.
   The Post said the reports, apparently based on satellite
photography, conflicted with recent statements by Cheney and Vice
President Dan Quayle that the Soviets continued to deploy new
weapons.
   Responding to that assertion, Cheney said the Soviets might have
slowed deployments of some new systems in order not to exceed a
ceiling proposed for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which
would slash long-range superpower nuclear weapons by 30 percent to
50 percent.
   That treaty is not expected to be the centerpiece of a summit
planned for Dec. 2-3 in the Mediterranean Sea. Senior U.S.
officials have said the START deal might be ready for another
meeting between President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev slated for
next spring or summer.

<NOTE>Violent Crime Up 5 Percent In First Half Of This Year, FBI Says</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI statistics indicate a 7 percent jump in
robberies paced a 5 percent increase in violent crime during the
first half of 1989.
   Overall, reported crimes went up 3 percent during the first six
months of this year from the same period in 1988, with each of the
nation's four regions posting increases, the bureau said in its
Uniform Crime Report released Sunday.
   By comparison, the FBI's overall crime index increased 1 percent
during both the first halves of 1987 and 1988 and went up 8 percent
during the first six months of 1986.
   There was a 4 percent increase in overall crime reports in both
the South and the West. Crime went up 2 percent in the Midwest and
3 percent in the Northeast, the report said.
   Among various categories of crime, the biggest increase was an
11 percent jump in motor vehicle thefts, followed by a 7 percent
hike in robberies.
   Murders increased 5 percent over the same period last year,
while aggravated assaults went up 4 percent.
   The number of murders in the first half of 1988 was virtually
unchanged from the same period in 1987, when there was a 2 percent
drop from the same period in 1986, the bureau said.

<TEXT>
   Could an American do in Tokyo what Mitsubishi did
with a stroke of its pen in New York _ gain controlling interest in
the landmark Rockefeller Center?
   The answer is sure ... well, maybe ... but, if. ...
   For one thing, not much real estate is available in central
Tokyo to buy and what's available is far more expensive than
similar real estate in the United States.
   ``If the building were worth having, nobody would sell it,''
says James Doherty, a real estate analyst at Jardine Fleming
Securities.
   Vacancy rates in central Tokyo are below 0.5 percent and land
prices are as high as 35.3 million yen per square meter _ $22,940 a
square foot, or $992 million an acre.
   The Mitsubishi Estate Co. of Japan paid $846 million for a 51
percent share of the Rockefeller Group, which owns the 22-acre
Rockefeller Center in the prime midtown area of Manhattan.
   If Rockefeller Center were in central Tokyo, its 22 acres would
be worth about $21.7 billion at going Japanese real estate prices,
and 51 percent of that comes to about $11 billion.
   Mitsubishi paid the $846 million not for the land but for the
majority share in the Rockefeller Group.
   That's how the Japanese are accustomed to operating, said
Doherty, and it's how an American or another foreigner probably
would have to operate in Tokyo to make a deal like Mitsubishi did
in New York.
   ``It's easier to buy companies than to buy land,'' Doherty said.
   But Tokyo, which was razed by an earthquake in 1923 and by
Allied bombing in World War II, doesn't have prestigious landmarks
like Rockefeller Center.
   ``There just aren't many buildings with much status,'' says
Noriko Hama, a researcher at the Mitsubishi Research Institute.
   ``People might be shocked if a foreigner bought the Kasumigaseki
Building,'' Japan's first skyscraper, ``but it wouldn't be for sale
anyway,'' she said.
   Lawyers and analysts active in mergers and acquisitions in Japan
say it isn't government regulations, as many foreigners believe,
that prevent foreigners from buying Japanese real estate or
companies, but the realities of the marketplace _ plus the age-old
insularity of the Japanese, as well as those things foreign eyes
don't see and foreign ears don't hear.
   Among the realities of the marketplace are high stock prices and
a system of share-crossholdings that locks about 70 percent of all
stocks in the hands of stable shareholders who often are corporate
allies. In addition, not many shares are in circulation.
   So far, foreign corporate buyouts of listed companies in Japan
number exactly one _ the recent acquisition of Sansui Electric Co.
by the British conglomerate Polly Peck International PLC.
   The tendency in Japan's corporate world to do business only with
trusted allies has traditionally limited both domestic and foreign
participation in mergers and acquisitions.
   Such deals, says lawyer Kanji Ishizumi in his 1988 book
``Acquiring Japanese Companies,'' have customarily been arranged as
rescues by associated firms or banks of companies in trouble.
   Selling to an outsider, especially for speculative purposes,
Ishizumi says, is ``as much a betrayal as a captain of a ship
deserting his crew in a storm.''
   Ishizumi recommends that foreign buyers cultivate informal ties
with businessmen and even government officials before attempting
any takeover activity to avoid a backlash.
   Without that type of ``nemawashi,'' or groundwork, investors
face the same rejection that Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens has run
into in his battles to win a seat on the board of Koito
Manufacturing, even though he holds a 26 percent stake in the
company. Toyota Motor Co., with a 19 percent share, has three seats.
   ``It is necessary to build a trusting relationship first,'' said
Tamotsu Aoyama, a Koito director. ``In Japan, it is not possible to
just say, `I'm a major shareholder,' and get a seat on the board
right away.''
   But foreign investment is growing here, nevertheless. Mergers
and acquisitions experts predict a boom as foreign pressure against
exclusionary business practices makes it increasingly difficult for
Japanese corporations to shut out foreign competitors.
   In the fiscal year that ended March 31, foreign investments in
Japan were up 46.5 percent over the previous year to $3.24 billion,
according to the Finance Ministry.
   It says investment by U.S. firms took 54.7 percent of the total,
jumping 89.1 percent over the previous year to $1.77 billion. The
United States meanwhile attracted $21.7 billion in direct
investment from Japan, up 47.6 percent from fiscal 1987.
   Federal Express, Merck Pharmaceuticals, Motorola, Bayer and
General Electric Co. are among many foreign companies that have
made small inroads.
   Pickens' stake in Koito and Polly Peck's takeover of the ailing
Sansui Electric Co. indicate traditional barriers to foreigners are
crumbling, says Howard Chao, an attorney with the Tokyo office of
O'Melveny and Myers.
   ``Foreign acquisitions are heating up in Japan,'' Chao added.
``There are indications it will open up more and more.''
   Likely targets for foreign takeovers, analysts say, are
companies in straits similar to Sansui. Once one of Japan's top
three audio equipment makers, Sansui has not paid a dividend for
five years and faced the threat of no longer being listed on the
stock exchange if not rescued from its debt by March.
   Polly Peck's $108.8 million, 51 percent stake in Sansui gained
the British company entry into Japan's competitive electronics
market.
   In another deal, two regional supermarket chains, Chujitsuya Co.
and Inageya Co., turned to the U.S.-backed firm of Nomura
Wasserstein Perella Co. to underwrite a share issue and help fend
off a takeover bid by property giant Shuwa Corp., said Doherty.
   ``It wouldn't be difficult to imagine an asset-heavy company
worn down by takeover attempts being grateful for a foreign `white
knight' to come along ... although one would have to be seen very
clearly as a savior from a fate worse than death,'' he said. ``The
market is moving toward this.''
   Pickens bought many of his shares in Koito Manufacturing from
the Tokyo-based Azabu Group, a group of companies affiliated with
Azabu Motors Co. that is well-known for arbitrage activities.
   ``Acquisitions of Japanese companies are almost never tender
offers, they are usually furtive, creeping accumulations of stock
holdings by such groups,'' said Chao.

   Military jets resumed flights over this
Atlanta suburb three days after a Navy attack plane crashed into an
apartment complex, killing two people and critically injuring two.
   Officials of Naval Air Station Atlanta had said pilots were
taking a few days off from training flights.
   But Petty Officer Linda Herring said Sunday the Navy considered
the crash an ``isolated incident'' and was not suspending any
flight operations.
   ``If an investigation indicates that changes should be made, we
will of course make them,'' she said. The investigation into
Thursday's A-7E Corsair II crash is expected to take at least 30
days.
   Funerals will be paid by the Navy, The Marietta Daily Journal
reported today, quoting unidentified officials.
   Killed were Richard Dick, 24, and Margie Padovani, who was 28
years old and two months pregnant. Dick's body will be transported
to Mississippi and Ms. Padovani's to New York.
   Her 5-year-old daughter, Jacquelyn, suffered burns over about
half of her body and was in critical condition today at Grady
Memorial Hospital.
   The 37-year-old pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Robert M. Conlyn Jr., also was
in critical condition today, at Kennestone Hospital in Marietta.
   Conlyn was the only person aboard the unarmed plane and ejected
just before it crashed into the Pine Village apartment complex,
engulfing it in flames.
   The jet was returning to the station adjacent to Dobbins Air
Force Base 15 miles from downtown Atlanta when it went down.
   On Saturday, residents of the 76-unit complex received $140,000
in interim compensation from the Navy and displaced families began
retrieving possessions that survived the fire.
   Twelve families whose apartments were destroyed have been
relocated. Twenty other apartments were heavily damaged, said
Kathie Barton, Smyrna's director of community relations.

<HEAD>Government Suing in Third Grounding in Florida Keys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is suing the owners of a Greek
freighter that ran aground on a fragile coral reef in the Florida
Keys, blaming negligence for the third such grounding in less than
three weeks.
   The U.S. Attorney's office filed the lawsuit Sunday with a
federal magistrate.
   Today, a Coast Guard board of inquiry was scheduled to begin
taking testimony from officers and crew, said Justice Department
spokeswoman Diane Cossin.
   Federal agents already have seized the 470-foot freighter MV
Elpis, which smashed living corals when it grounded Friday night on
Elbow Reef in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary.
   ``At this point, we're alleging negligence on behalf of those in
charge of the vessel,'' Ms. Cossin said. The U.S. District Court
suit will demand payment of recovery costs and compensation for
damage to the ocean ecosystem, but the amount hasn't been decided,
Ms. Cossin said.
   A similar suit in one of the earlier groundings seeks $9 million
in damages.
   The Elpis ran aground as its crew deliberately steered close to
the reef, away from the northward currents of the Gulf Stream, to
save time and fuel, said Michael White, manager of the Key Largo
National Marine Sanctuary.
   ``They were a little bit confused by the (navigation) lights,''
said sanctuary officer Jayson Horadam. ``They knew something was
wrong, but as they were rechecking their position, they went
aground.''
   The ship, carrying sugar and fuel oil, floated free at high tide
Saturday. There were no reports of fuel leaking.
   Federal agents boarded the vessel and moved it to an anchorage
off Miami Beach, Ms. Cossin said.
   The grounding did serious damage, said Billy Causey, a federal
marine biologist who inspected the site Sunday to help prepare
estimates for the lawsuit.
   ``Some of the major framework of the reef has been fractured and
damaged considerably,'' Causey said.
   Horadam said he spoke with the crew seven hours after the
accident, and they were cooperative.
   ``At first they weren't comprehending what the big to-do was
about,'' he said. ``We explained to them it was like somebody
destroying the Acropolis, and that totally got their attention.''
   The Elpis grounded about 4 miles south of the spot where the
155-foot freighter Alec Owen Maitland ran aground Oct. 25, cutting
a 200-foot swath through the sanctuary's reef.
   Five days later, the 475-foot cargo ship Mavro Vetranic got
stuck on a reef off the Dry Tortugas in the far western Keys. The
government is seeking $9 million in damages for the destruction of
a 500-foot strip of coral.
   The sanctuary is designed to preserve parts of the world's third
largest living reef, which extends about 200 miles from Miami to
the Dry Tortugas.

   Deng Xiaoping, retired from his final Communist
Party post but still China's paramount leader, told a group of
Japanese today that they would be the last official delegation he
meets, sources at the session said.
   Deng, in the meeting with the Japanese business group, said he
was determined to make a clean break with official functions to
realize his goal of ending lifetime office-holding by senior
officials, the sources said.
   The Communist Party Central Committee on Thursday accepted
Deng's resignation as chairman of the party's Central Military
Commission, a powerful body that oversees military policy.
   Deng's handpicked successor, new party General Secretary Jiang
Zemin, was named to replace him on the commission.
   Deng, 85, resigned from most of his party and government
positions two years ago, leading a drive to force aging politicians
out of office and rejuvenate the Chinese leadership.
   However, he has remained the ultimate arbiter of policy through
his powerful links to those officially in power. He is expected to
remain China's most powerful man as long as he is in good health.
   At the meeting today, Deng expressed confidence in the abilities
of 63-year-old Jiang, who was plucked from the relative obscurity
of party boss in Shanghai to head the 48 million-member party after
the ouster of reformist leader Zhao Ziyang in June.
   Zhao was removed during the crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement, which was crushed June 4 with a military assault in
central Beijing that claimed the lives of hundreds of unarmed
civilians.
   Deng today acknowledged that Jiang, who has no strong power base
in Beijing, lacks experience. But he said Jiang was an intellectual
with impressive knowledge and ability and he felt reassured with
Jiang in power.
   Deng was speaking to Eishiro Saito, president of the Japan
Federation of Economic Organizations and head of the 35-member
business delegation.
   The meeting was held at the Great Hall of the People, the seat
of government. A day after his retirement was announced Deng met
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at the Great Hall.
   Deng today implied that the talks would be his last at the Great
Hall, although he would continue meeting foreign visitors in a
private capacity elsewhere.

<HEAD>Flood Threat Recedes in Northwest; Record Highs in South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The return of colder temperatures helped ease the flood threat
in the Pacific Northwest, but it was more like summer again today
in the south central and southeastern United States.
   Warm weather that melted mountain snow, combined with days of
heavy rain, had led to flooding that caused millions of dollars in
damage in Washington state. But even though more rain was predicted
today, colder temperatures were expected to prevent further
snowmelt in the mountains.
   High mountain passes in Washington got up to four inches of snow
Sunday night, while Browning, Mont., got 11 inches of snow.
Northwestern Montana also had some flooding during the weekend from
storms that dropped up to five inches of rain in some areas.
   Farther south, 30 cities had record high temperatures Sunday as
readings soared into the 70s and 80s from the High Plains to the
southern and middle Atlantic Coast.
   Readings of 81 degrees at Chattanooga, Tenn., and 76 degrees at
Rapid City, S.D., were the warmest on record for so late in the
season. Early this morning temperatures remained in the 60s in much
of the South and central parts of the country.
   Except for the Northwest, dry weather prevailed across the
nation.
   The high for the nation Sunday was 89 degrees at Borrego
Springs, Calif., Gila Bend, Ariz., and Mcallen, Texas.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl tried today to
allay concerns that events in East Gemany could affect the future
of West German commitments to Poland.
   Kohl continued a grueling program, traveling by bus in dense fog
to the southeastern city of Lublin, where he was awarded an
honorary doctorate by the prestigious Catholic University.
   In his address, Kohl assured his Polish hosts that ``We wish to
support these (Polish) reforms from the outside through a
prospective form of cooperation ... We are ready for such
dialogue.''
   West Germany has already pledged about $1.5 billion in aid, but
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz has said that is still not
enough and does not correspond to West Germany's ability to help.
   The chancellor was to meet with lawmakers in Warsaw this
afternoon.
   Kohl held ``unusually intense and open'' talks with Communist
President Wojciech Jaruzelski and Solidarity Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki on Sunday night, said Hans Klein, the chancellor's
spokesman.
   He told reporters the talks centered on the ``dramatic
developments'' in East Germany and the reform movement in Poland.
   The talks in Warsaw took place after Kohl and Mazowiecki
attended Mass in a former German village where members of the Nazi
resistance met during the war.
   The two men embraced in a sign of reconciliation before a crowd
of about 5,000 worshippers, many of whom are ethnic Germans who
decided to remain in their native region of Silesia.
   After the war, large parts of East Prussia and Silesia were
awarded to Poland and the border issue remains extremely sensitive
for both countries.
   West Germany pledged to respect the Oder and Neisse rivers as
Poland's western border in a 1970 Warsaw treaty, but a reunified
Germany might not be committed to those terms.
   West German conservatives recently have suggested seeking
reunification within the 1937 borders, which include about
one-third of present-day Poland.
   Kohl alluded to the pain of those Germans expelled as a result
of the postwar settlement in a speech in Warsaw on Thursday. Poland
also lost large areas of territory, which were incorporated into
the Soviet Union.
   Polish television on Sunday broadcast two panel discussions
devoted to the explosion of events in East Germany and the
consequences for Poland of Germany reunification.
   Some of the participants welcomed the dismantling of the Berlin
Wall, saying it brought Poland as well as East Germany closer to
Western Europe.
   But any tampering with the postwar order that would alter affect
Polish security was out of the question.
   ``I would like to hear a clear assurance that our western border
is untouchable, said Jacek Maziarski, a journalist at Tygodnik
Solidarnosc, the weekly edited by Mazowiecki until he became prime
minister on Aug. 24.
   ``I want to believe Germans will also understand there is more
sense in business than in initiation of new fights,'' Maziarski
said.
   Klein said Kohl had raised the issue of a concentration of
assistance for East Germany, but the spokesman appeared to indicate
that would not jeopardize help for Poland.
   The two countries signed agreements that pledge $1.5 billion in
aid for Poland before Kohl interrupted his visit Friday for one day
to attend an emergency Cabinet meeting in Bonn on the East German
situation.
   The Solidarity-led government said aid is needed for the country
to make the transition to a market economy and secure democratic
reforms now under way.

   Legendary Communist leader Dolores
Ibarruri, nicknamed ``La Pasionaria'' for her fiery oratory during
the Spanish Civil War, died Sunday. She was 93.
   She died at 7:30 p.m. in Madrid's Ramon y Cajal Hospital, a
statement from the hospital director said. Dr. Juan Beltran said
Mrs. Ibarruri died of pneumonia ``with respiratory insufficiency.''
   At her bedside was her sole surviving child _ her daughter Amaya
_ and other relatives.
   During the 1936 siege of Madrid by rebel forces led by Gen.
Francisco Franco, Mrs. Ibarruri's defiant pharse ``No pasaran!''
(``They shall not pass''), became the rallying cry of the loyalist
Republican army.
   Her speeches made her an anti-fascist heroine to millions during
the 1936-39 war.
   The daughter and granddaughter of northern Basque coal miners,
she was a founding member of the Spanish Communist Party. At the
time of her death, she was the party's honorary president.
   After Franco's nationalists won the war in 1939, she fled to the
Soviet Union, returning to Madrid in 1977, two years after Franco's
death.

   Willard C. ``Bill'' Worcester, a retired
executive with the Pulliam newspapers and one of the organizers of
Phoenix Newspapers Inc., died Saturday at his home. He was 86.
   In 1946, Worcester was named general manager and a director of
Indianapolis-based Central Newspapers Inc., the parent Pulliam
corporation, and executive vice president and publisher of the
chain's papers in Muncie, Ind.
   That year, Worcester participated in Central's purchase of The
Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette from the Arizona
Publishing Co. Central set up a subsidiary, Phoenix Newspapers, to
publish the newspapers and Worcester became first vice president
and a director of the corporation.
   He served as acting publisher of the Republic and the Gazette in
1952 and 1953. Worcester later served a stint as general manager of
Phoenix Newspapers before again becoming publisher of the Muncie
newspapers.
   In 1977, Worcester was named executive-in-residence in the
Arizona State University College of Business Administration.
   He is survived by his wife, Idona; his daughter, Nancy W. Chase;

   An American Airlines jet safely aborted takeoff
at O'Hare International Airport after a warning light went on in
the cockpit. No one was injured, officials said.
   The Chicago-to-Stockholm Flight 80 was speeding down a runway
Sunday when the warning light for a landing gear door went on, said
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mort Edelstein.
   He said the pilot aborted the takeoff, causing the brakes on the
Boeing 767 to overheat and smoke.
   None of the 168 people aboard was reported injured, said airline
spokesman Jim Brown.
   The plane was towed to a maintenance hangar, where passengers
got off and boarded buses back to the terminal, Brown said. A few
hours later, they were put on another plane.
   Brown said late Sunday that mechanics hadn't determined why the
warning light had gone on.

<HEAD>Ex-Convict From Australia Goes on Trial in Florida Murder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IKE FLORES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCKLEDGE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He has two families, two identities and
two homelands. He's also an ex-convict charged with the murder of
an interior decorator last Thanksgiving Eve.
   James Hudson Savage, or Russell Thomas Moore, 26, is from
Australia's bush country. He was taken from his teen-age mother
shortly after birth and adopted by a missionary couple who brought
him to the United States.
   Prosecutors allege that he robbed, raped and strangled Barbara
Ann Barber outside her Melbourne, Fla., shop Nov. 23, just 33 days
after his release from Florida's maximum-security state prison and
11 years after the first of his many brushes with the law.
   Savage-Moore's trial on charges of first-degree murder, sexual
battery and robbery was scheduled to begin today in circuit court
in Rockledge. Jury selection was expected to take about two days,
and opening arguments were expected to begin Wednesday.
   Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, while a defense
attorney, his biological mother and his adoptive parents all want
him returned to Australia, regardless of the trial's outcome.
   Beverley Moore Whyman, the defendant's mother, contends her son
was illegally taken from her 26 years ago under an Australian
program that allowed aborigine children to be removed from their
families and tribal homelands for adoption by whites.
   That government policy, which continued until the late 1960s,
resulted in a high rate of mortality, suicide, unemployment,
truancy, alcoholism, welfare-dependency and crime, aboriginal
activists contend.
   The baby called Russell Thomas Moore was adopted by a white
missionary couple, Graeme and Nesta Savage, in 1963 when he was 4
months old. His name was changed to James Hudson Savage, and at the
age of 7 he accompanied his adoptive parents when they came to
Melbourne, Fla.
   In his teens, James Hudson Savage turned to crime and became a
heavy user of drugs and alcohol and had explosions of violence and
sexually deviant behavior, according to police records.
   He served four prison sentences _ for car theft, burglary and
violent behavior in prison, including trying to kill a fellow
inmate and a guard.
   He tried to commit suicide and was committed to a psychiatric
facility at Florida State Prison. But he was freed under the
state's early-release program.
   A little over a month later, he was charged with raping and
strangling the interior designer in an alleyway outside her
showroom.
   The Savages said they were unable to find him in 1983 when they
moved back to Australia to continue their missionary work. His
biological mother heard nothing of him after he was taken from her
for adoption _ until after he was charged with murder.
   Money was raised by aboriginal activists in Australia so she
could come here and be reunited with her son. She and others have
been trying to persuade authorities to send him back to Australia,
even if he is convicted, so he won't have to face the death penalty.
   Savage's lawyer, George Turner, has refused comment on that
aspect of the case.
   Before the trial, Turner won approval from Circuit Judge
Lawrence Johnston to refer to his client as Russell Thomas Moore,
rather than Savage, because his last name might cause the jury to
think of him as ``an uncivilized primitive.''
   The judge ruled he would allow prosecutors to refer to him as
``Mr. Savage.''
   ``We are not going to mock his name,'' asserted Assistant State
Attorney Russ Bausch at a hearing on the issue last week.

   The dollar inched up against most major foreign
currencies in early European trading today. Gold prices rose as
much as $5.40 an ounce.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was fluctuating in a narrow
range in quiet trading, and that attention had shifted to cross
rate trading.
   They said the market was still trying to digest the sweeping
reforms in East Germany, but said most traders expect the rapid
changes in relationships between the two Germanies to have a
positive impact on the West German mark.
   ``The German thing is throwing everything else into the shadows
right now,'' said a trader at a West German bank in Frankfurt.
   ``A lot of people abroad were assuming this would somehow be bad
for the (West) German economy and knocked the mark lower Friday.
They're apparently skeptical about the changes.''
   ``I think, when all is said and done, people will see this as a
positive rather than a negative factor for the mark,'' she said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.80 yen to a closing 143.55 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 143.68 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.8625 West German marks, unchanged
   _1.6420 Swiss francs, up from 1.6370
   _6.3175 French francs, up from 6.3135
   _2.1008 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0950
   _1,359.00 Italian lire, up from 1,354.75
   _1.1680 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1694
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5760 to buy one pound, slightly cheaper for buyers than $1.5765
late Friday.
   Spot gold was higher but below earlier peaks in lively trading
this morning in London, as fresh investor interest gave the
precious metal a boost.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $386.10 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $386.00. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $389.05.
   A wave of buying out of Zurich helped gold surge to $389.90
there, up from $384.50 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.25 to close at a bid $387.17.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.31 a troy
ounce, up from Friday's $5.25.

<TEXT>
   Leading Soviet economists today began discussing a
plan to increase wages and wholesale prices beginning next year,
and sell off some state-run enterprises to end an economic crisis
and build a market system.
   Emphasizing the seriousness of the undertaking, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and other members
of the Communist Party Politburo attended the session at Moscow's
white marble Hall of Columns in the House of Unions. But they did
not speak during the three-day conference's first session.
   ``We cannot wait for reform,'' economist Leonid I. Abalkin,
chosen to head the push for economic reform, said in his keynote
speech. ``The value of time has grown enormously.''
   ``The situation is dangerous. The threat is grave,'' added a
second economist, Stanislav S. Shatalin.
   The plan published last month in the Economicheskaya Gazeta
newspaper offered a detailed analysis of an economy plagued by
shortages, hoarding, a near-worthless currency, top-heavy
bureaucracy and an increasing number of strikes.
   In contrast to much of the public debate over the economy, it
provided a plan to free up prices, jettison state-run enterprises
that are losing money, and aim toward convertibility of the ruble
by the mid-1990s.
   The plan was a response to Gorbachev's demand that economists
stop their public bickering and formulate a plan of action.
   Ed Hewett, an American expert on the Soviet economy, told
reporters watching a live broadcast of the session at the Foreign
Ministry press center that if implemented there is a ``decent
chance'' the plan will work.
   But after more than four years of attempted reform that only
have worsened the economy, the public must be convinced. And the
government must chop away at the budget deficit and pent-up
consumer demand in the next year, Hewett said.
   ``The next year is when we're going to find out if they're
really going to do it,'' he said. ``Abalkin's thrown down the
gauntlet.''
   Abalkin, deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, or
cabinet, told the conference of academics and economic managers
they must overcome public disillusion.
   In a poll conducted in conjunction with the economic proposal,
54 percent of those questioned said their first priority was
``introduction of strict discipline and order,'' and 40 percent
said they wanted the government to tighten, not loosen, price
controls, he said.
   In response to another question, 22 percent said the problems of
the Soviet economy are inherent in socialism, Abalkin said.
   Abalkin's plan calls for wage increases beginning next year,
free-floating prices and ``healthy competition'' regulated by
anti-monopoly laws.
   The plan proposes a timetable for conversion of the state-run
economy to a mixture of state-held industries, publicly owned
enterprises and private cooperatives.
   The blueprint foresees the sale of shares in industrial
enterprises, establishment of a stock market, competitive bidding
for state contracts and legislative oversight to prevent abuses of
the new system.
   It also proposes temporary unemployment benefits for those who
must be retrained when their jobs are eliminated.
   ``Sooner or later we are going to have to take the bitter
medicine of raising prices,'' said the report published in
Ekonomicheskaya Gazetta. Without that, it concludes, there is no
way to eliminate widespread shortages of food and consumer goods,
combat rampant speculation and the ``shadow economy'' in which
scarse goods are being siphoned from legitimate channels and sold
or traded under the table or on the black market.
   Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders have been talking about the
need for price reform for more than two years, but lifting of state
price controls has been put off indefinitely in the face of popular
anxiety and instances of runaway inflation in Yugoslavia and
Poland, both of which have tried to establish more realistic
pricing systems.

<TEXT>
   Communist leader Dolores Ibarruri, ``La
Pasionaria'' whose bold defiance during the Spanish Civil War
rallied millions in the fight against fascism, has died. She was 93.
   She died Sunday evening in Madrid's Ramon y Cajal Hospital, a
statement from the hospital director said. Dr. Juan Beltran said
Mrs. Ibarruri died of pneumonia with respiratory difficulties.
   At her bedside was her sole surviving child _ her daughter Amaya
_ and other relatives.
   Mrs. Ibarruri began a career as a labor organizer and strike
leader and wrote articles she signed as ``La Pasionaria,'' a name
she chose in 1916 because her first article appeared during Holy
Week, known in Spanish as the week of the Passion.
   During the 1936 siege of Madrid by rebel forces led by Gen.
Francisco Franco, Mrs. Ibarruri's defiant phrase ``They shall not
pass!'' became the rallying cry of the loyalist Republican army.
   Her speeches made her an anti-fascist heroine to millions during
the 1936-39 war.
   Many literary scholars believe she was the model for Pilar, the
heroine of Ernest Hemingway's novel of the war, ``For Whom the Bell
Tolls.''
   The daughter and granddaughter of northern Basque coal miners,
Mrs. Ibarruri was a founding member of the Spanish Communist Party.
At the time of her death, she was the party's honorary president.
   After Franco's nationalists won the war in 1939, she fled to the
Soviet Union and lived there for 38 years.
   She returned to Madrid in 1977, two years after Franco's death,
as Spain underwent a peaceful transition to democracy.
   That same year, she won back her deputy's seat first occupied in
1936 in the lower house of Parliament. She later gave it up because
of her age and delicate health.
   The Spanish Communist Party, which named her honorary president
in 1960, said in a statement, ``In informing with sorrow of her
death, the Spanish Communists address the Communist, socialist,
progressive forces and the democratic movement of all the world,
expressing our will of contributing with a daily effort to the
ideals of emancipation and peace which stimulated the life of
Dolores Ibarruri.''
   On Dec. 9, 1985, figures from the international Communist
movement and from Spain's socialist government feted La Pasionaria
on her 90th birthday.
   ``The name of La Pasionaria sums up an entire era in the
struggle of workers and the Spanish people for freedom, democracy
and progress,'' Cuban President Fidel Castro wrote in an article
published for the celebration.
   Born in the Basque village of Gallarta on Dec. 9, 1895, Mrs.
Ibarruri was the eighth of 11 children. She said the harsh
conditions of her youth turned her into a revolutionary. ``I knew
the terrible pain of days without bread and winters without fire,''
she wrote in her autobiography, ``My Way.''
   Her family was too poor to pay for schooling so she abandoned
her ambition of becoming a teacher. She married Julian Ruiz, a
socialist activist five years her senior.
   Ruiz once recalled her as being as independent as a mountain
goat.
   Separated from his wife since the 1930s, Ruiz died a few weeks
after her return to Spain from Moscow.
   Dolores Ibarruri turned to politics after Ruiz introduced her to
socialism and Marxism. She read about the Russian revolution. ``Two
names,'' she wrote later, ``struck me in my heart and in my head _
Russia and Lenin. I no longer felt sad, I no longer felt alone.''
   In 1934, she led a rebellion by 40,000 miners in the northern
province of Asturias.
   When the civil war broke out in July 1936, she led rallies,
visited Republican forces and made ringing radio broadcasts.
   She nearly always wore black. Once, when asked why, she
responded: ``A woman of humble background like me can't wear bright
clothes. With a black dress, although it may be inexpensive, one
can go anywhere and one goes more decently.''
   Shortly after her return from exile, she underwent an operation
to have a pacemaker installed. She had suffered sporadic health
problems since.
   She first entered the hospital Sept. 13, but one month later
returned to her Madrid home after undergoing treatment for
pneumonia.
   Mrs. Ibarruri entered the hospital Nov. 8 in serious condition
with pneumonia and heart trouble.
   She is survived by her daughter Amaya. Five other children died
in infancy. The Spanish Communist Party announced that
secretary-general Julio Anguita and other party leaders would meet
to make arrangements for the funeral.

   The mother of former Prime
Minister David Lange today said she hated her son after weekend
revelations he left his wife for his speechwriter.
   ``My heart is full of hatred, and I don't want to speak to
him,'' Lange's 80-year-old mother, Phoebe, told reporters. ``We
will all pray that he comes to his senses.''
   Lange, 47, on Friday announced he and his wife, Naomi, had
separated after 21 years of marriage. He gave no reason.
   But the Wellington's Dominion Sunday Times newspaper quoted his
wife as saying in an interview that her husband was stolen by his
longtime speechwriter, Margaret Pope. She complained the couple's
three children needed a father.
   Lange resigned after five years as prime minister in August,
citing health reasons. His romance fueled speculation he would quit
politics, but Lange said today he intended to contest his seat at
Mangere in next year's general election.
   As prime minister, Lange clashed sharply with the United States
over New Zealand's policy of banning nuclear weapons from its
territory.
   Lange's mother told reporters that her son contacted her Tuesday
to tell her he was leaving his wife.
   ``I was furious. I didn't swear, but I told him in no uncertain
terms what I thought of him,'' she said.

   A Spokane woman says her 25-year-old son,
a social studies and English teacher, was killed in El Salvador
over the weekend by a grenade.
   Kay Babcock said Sunday she was told that her son, Christopher,
who had taught at the American High School in San Salvador for two
years, apparently was struck by a grenade fragment in the head late
Saturday.
   Mrs. Babcock said she was informed of her son's death Sunday by
Spokane police. In San Salvador, U.S. Embassy spokesman Barry
Jacobs said a U.S. citizen who taught at the school was killed, but
did not identify him.
   ``He always said he was in a place where Americans weren't
really at risk,'' Mrs. Babcock said in an interview with the
Spokane Chronicle and Spokesman-Review. ``I don't suppose he ever
really thought about it.''
   In San Salvador, government forces fought today for control of
the capital after leftist rebels, in their biggest offensive since
1981, seized parts of the city and attacked military posts in the
provinces.
   Carlos Mendoza, spokesman for the Salvadoran Red Cross, said at
least 20 civilians were killed in the fighting.
   At least 139 people were killed and 317 wounded, hospitals and
the military officials said, in fighting that began Saturday night
and prompted rightist President Alfredo Cristiani to declare a
state of siege.
   Babcock and his roommate apparently lived a few doors away from
the home of Christiani, his mother said.
   As he and a fellow American teacher were about to enter their
rented home late Saturday, a rifle grenade exploded somewhere near
them, his mother said she was told. She didn't know any other
details or the condition of her son's roommate.
   Students at the private school where Babcock taught were
primarily children of the country's ruling class, his mother said.
   Mrs. Babcock said her son felt a duty to teach El Salvador's
young people to be aware of what was happening around them.
   ``He knew they were going to be the country's leaders someday,''
she said. ``He was very idealistic.''
   In a telephone conversation last week, Babcock told his mother
``how he couldn't hear the bombing anymore,'' adding that ``he
didn't seem to indicate there was unrest'' in the air.

   Lebanon's new Christian president today
named Moslem leader Salim Hoss as premier, entrusting him with the
task of forming a united national government to end the country's
civil war.
   Staccato bursts of gunfire interspersed with shell blasts
resounded across the capital as the president spoke.
   Police said Syrian-backed Moslem militiamen were fighting
Christian army units across Beirut's sectarian Green Line. There
was no immediate report of casualties.
   Hoss' appointment puts him in a direct confrontation with
Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, who heads a three-man
interim military cabinet that competed with Hoss' Syrian-backed
Moslem government. Aoun governs the Christian enclave north and
northeast of Beirut.
   President Rene Mouawad, a Maronite, made today's announcement at
his temporary office in Moslem west Beirut after three days of
consultations with Parliament leaders.
   Hoss, 59, a Sunni Moslem banker-turned-politician, accepted his
fourth premiership in 13 years, pledging to carry out an
Arab-brokered peace accord that provides for equal power between
Moslems and Christians.
   After his announcement today, Mouawad, flanked by Hoss and
Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini, received in audience all
ambassadors to Lebanon.
   ``I call upon all of you to join our march toward peace,''
Mouawad said in brief remarks. ``We consider the Taif accord an
introduction to peace and a launching pad for a new republic.
   ``I pledge to whole world to consolidate the unity and
sovereignty of Lebanon and to rebuild its constitutional
institutions.''
   Mouawad urged the international community to pressure Israel
into evacuating a border enclave it occupied in south Lebanon in
1985 to serve as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla raids.
   He made no mention of the 40,000 Syrian troops who control 70
percent of Lebanon.
   The meeting underscored the widespread international recognition
of Mouawad's election and Aoun's diplomatic isolation.
   There was no U.S. diplomat at today's meeting. The United States
closed its Lebanon embassy Sept. 6 after Aoun's supporters
surrounded it during a protest.
   The peace accord increasing the influence of the Moslems was
approved by the Lebanese Parliament on Oct. 22 after a 23-day
special session in Saudi Arabia's summer resort of Taif under the
auspices of an Arab League committee.
   Nine days ago, Parliament moved to advance the pact by electing
Mouawad, 64, for the presidency that had been vacant for 409 days.
   Aoun, 54, a Maronite who declared a ``war of liberation'' in
March to drive the Syrian army out of Lebanon, has rejected
Mouawad's election as unconstitutional, calling him a ``Syrian
lackey.''
   Aoun, insisting that his cabinet was the country's sole
legitimate authority, has vowed to prevent Mouawad and his future
government from entering the Christian enclave.
   He was appointed to head the interim cabinet by President Amin
Gemayel on Sept. 22, 1988, when his 6-year term expired with
parliament unable to elect a successor because of religious
differences.
   Moslems rejected Aoun's appointment, contending it violated a
1943 unwritten national covenant that assigned the premiership to
the Sunnis, the presidency to the Maronites and parliament
speakership to the Shiite Moslems.
   They pledged allegiance to Hoss, who then was head of the
Syrian-backed Cabinet that broke from Gemayel. Hoss tendered the
resignation of that cabinet to Mouawad when he was elected
president.
   Hoss commands wide respect among Christians and Moslems alike
because he has adamantly refused to take sides throughout the
14-year-old civil war.
   Meanwhile, the Syrian-backed Amal militia clashed with the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley overnight,
police said today.
   Two Amal fighters were wounded, a police spokesman said.
   He said the fighting between the rival Shiite militias in the
western Bekaa village of Sohmor also destroyed Amal's headquarters
in the village. The village had been under joint control.
   Hezbollah intermittently fought fierce battles with Amal for
dominance of Lebanon's Shiites from April 1988 until January this
year. At least 500 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in the
nine-month confrontation that ended with Syrian and Iranian
mediation.

<TEXT>
   Reports of a rare blood disease spread
after the government warned consumers to temporarily stop taking
L-tryptophan, a dietary supplement suspected of causing the
outbreak.
   Investigators from the Food and Drug Administration on Sunday
finished interviewing people with the disorder and collecting
samples of L-tryptophan from stores in New Mexico, which has the
greatest number of cases, said Nancy Hunter, spokeswoman for the
state's Health and Environment Department.
   The team will test for contamination of the non-prescription
remedy touted as ``nature's sleeping pill'' and sold in health food
stores to treat sleeplessness and premenstrual syndrome.
   The number of reported cases of the potentially fatal disorder
eosinophilia climbed to 55 over the weekend as California, Virginia
and Minnesota joined six other states already reporting the
syndrome, said Dr. Edwin Kilbourne of the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control. There were 21 in New Mexico, four in Oregon, three in
Texas and one each from Arizona, Missouri and Mississippi.
   At least 11 patients with eosinophilia have been hospitalized,
including nine in New Mexico.
   The increase in cases prompted the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to warn consumers to emporarily discontinue use of
L-tryptophan, an amino acid.
   The FDA said a joint investigation with the CDC had yet to
determine a cause-and-effect association with the blood condition
but ``affected persons in most of the cases have reported taking
L-tryptophan products before becoming ill.''
   Symptoms of the disorder include sharp muscular pain, fatigue,
fever and rashes. The syndrome usually is associated with bronchial
asthma, allergies, parasitic infections or reactions to medicine.
   It is called eosinophilia because it is characterized by high
counts of a type of white blood cells called eosinophils.
   New Mexico health officials asked retailers to stop selling
L-tryptophan while the investigation is under way.
   Makers of L-tryptophan said they don't believe their product is
to blame for the outbreak, although they said small, disreputable
companies may have produced contaminated batches.
   Annette Dickinson, technical counselor of the Council for
Responsible Nutrition, a Washington-based trade association of food
supplement manufacturers, said most L-tryptophan is processed by
large manufacturers. Many of them are pharmaceutical companies that
adhere to drug-level quality control, she said.
   She said it is possible small, disreputable companies might be
producing contaminated L-tryptophan, ``but I wouldn't expect their
distribution to be very widespread.''
   Sixteen people died nationwide in 1986 as a result of
hypereosinophilic syndrome, a form of eosinophilia, and 12 died in
1987, said Sandy Smith of the National Center for Health Statistics
in Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>Central Committee Formally Ousts Zhao</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party Central Committee has
formally ousted former party chief Zhao Ziyang from its ranks,
sources said today, nearly six months after he was accused of
supporting the student-led democracy movement.
   The Nov. 6-9 plenary session of the committee voted that Zhao,
who was ousted from office in June, would be removed from all his
duties in the committee, according to sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Central Committee, meeting for the first time since the June
session during which Zhao was purged, did not mention Zhao in its
final communique, leaving open the question of how the party would
handle his case.
   Some party hard-liners reportedly hoped to put Zhao on trial on
charges of fomenting counter-revolutionary rebellion, but others,
including senior leader Deng Xiaoping, are believed to have
resisted.
   It was unclear whether Zhao had been stripped of his party
membership as well or would be allowed to remain a member of the
47-million-member party he once headed.
   Zhao, 70, one of the architects and main proponents of the
market-oriented reforms that have brought prosperity to millions of
Chinese, still commands wide popular support.
   He has not been seen in public since an emotional meeting with
student hunger strikers on May 19, and is believed to be under
house arrest.
   The June 24 Central Committee meeting that accused him of making
serious mistakes in the ``anti-party, anti-socialism turmoil''
approved his dismissal from all his party posts, including his seat
on the 170-member Central Committee.
   Last week's vote apparently gave a formal stamp to that decision.
   China's crackdown on political dissent continued with a report
today of a man arrested in southeastern China for painting
``reactionary slogans'' on buildings and portraits of Mao Tse-tung.
   Police arrested factory official Sun Xiongying in late September
for defacing public property and portraits of China's revolutionary
leader in the coastal city of Fuzhou, the Legal Daily News said.
   Sun smeared ``reactionary slogans'' on buildings at the May 1st
Factory, Workers' Cultural Palace and City Hall as well as on
pictures of Mao, the paper said.
   It did not further identify Sun, say what the slogans were or
explain the delay in reporting his arrest, adding only that the
case was being tried.
   Arrests continue nationwide in the wake of the widespread
pro-democracy protests of this spring. Authorities are continuing
their searches for ``counterrevolutionaries'' accused of fomenting
the unrest and plotting to overthrow China's communist government.
   Earlier this month police in the southern province of Guizhou
reported arresting 10 members of an underground group allegedly
conspiring to overthrow the government.
   Last week police in Chongqing, central Sichuan province, were
reported to have broken up a ``counterrevolutionary clique'' and
arrested four members who planned to organize underground armed
forces and tried to steal firearms and ammunition.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with six grafs to CORRECT name from Hearth to Herath;

<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the Sinhalese group that
has been waging an anti-government campaign of terror was shot to
death by government forces today while in custody, the foreign
minister said today.
   Rohana Wijeweera, head of the People's Liberation Front, was
arrested Sunday afternoon in the central hill district, the
official, Ranjan Wijeratne, told a news conference.
   Wijeweera subsequently agreed to lead government security men to
one of the front's offices in a Colombo suburb, Wijeratne said.
   Once in the office, Wijeweera instructed front Politburo member
H.B. Herath to hand over some documents, he added.
   Herath pretended to do so but instead pulled a gun and fired at
Wijeweera, and then government forces opened fire, killing both
Wijeweera and Herath, the minister said.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa has ordered an investigation into
the shooting. Wijeratne, who is also deputy defense minister, said
security forces had already cremated the bodies of Wijeweera and
Herath under emergency regulations that allow them to dispose of
bodies without further inquiry.
   The circumstances of Wijeweera's death, if uncorroborated,
seemed likely to prompt charges he was murdered by security forces.
Such charges could aggravate the violence in the Sinhalese
heartland.
   Wijeweera's organization accuses the Sinhalese-dominated
government of selling out the country's Sinhalese majority in an
effort to make peace with ethnic Tamil guerrillas.
   More than 6,000 people have been killed in the past two years in
the struggle between the government and the People's Liberation
Front.
   Wijeratne, reading a statement from army commander Hamilton
Wanasinghe, said Wijeweera was detained with his wife and five
children Sunday afternoon in Ulapane village near Kandy, 55 miles
northeast of Colombo.
   According to this account, the soldiers suspected Wijeweera's
true identity even though he had shaved his beard, trimmed his
hair, gained weight and looked younger than his age. Wijeweera, who
was born in 1943, acknowledged his identity and was taken to
Colombo, the statement said.
   Wijeweera, who once studied in the Soviet Union, founded the
People's Liberation Front. The group has Marxist roots.
   The government has blamed the front for most of the killings in
the group's campaign of terror. However, human rights activists and
opposition politicians say many were revenge killings by government
forces or pro-government vigilantes.
   The People's Liberation Front denounced the Sri Lankan
government for signing an Indian-brokered peace accord in 1987 in
an effort to end the revolt by Tamil separatists in northeastern
Sri Lanka.
   The front said the accord promised too many concessions to the
Tamils, and it vowed to kill anyone who supported the pact.
   In addition to the 6,000 people killed in the Sinhalese
violence, more than 11,000 people have died in the predominantly
Tamil northeast since the separatist revolt by Tamil militants
began in 1983.

   Authorities believe two teen-agers
held in the killings of a General Motors Corp. executive and his
wife chose their victims at random.
   The bullet-riddled bodies of Glenn E. Tarr, 53, and his wife,
Wanda, 58, were found in a park in nearby Pontiac on Friday, a day
after their home was ransacked and robbed and their two cars stolen.
   A 17-year-old Pontiac boy and a 16-year-old boy from Waterford
Township were arrested Saturday. They were scheduled to be
arraigned today in the killings.
   One of the teen-agers was seen driving one of the Tarrs' cars
Saturday in Rochester Hills, said Sgt. Maurice McAllister, of the
county Sheriff's Department. The car was later found abandoned in
Bloomfield Township. The Tarrs other car was found Friday night in
Rochester.
   A gun found inside one of the cars was believed to have been
used in the killings, McAllister said.
   Investigators believe the teen-agers abducted Wanda Tarr at
random when she stopped at an automatic teller machine at the
National Bank of Detroit in Rochester Hills, then forced her to
return home, Sheriff's Capt. Lewis Doyle said.
   Guns, liquor, jewelry and part of a coin collection were taken
from the home, said sheriff's Lt. Gerard Carlin.
   Glenn Tarr, a 25-year GM employee, was assistant manager of
marketing information and research for the Chevrolet Division
headquarters in Warren, GM spokesman Jim Crellin said. Wanda Tarr
sold life insurance for Christian Memorial Cultural Center in
Rochester Hills.

<HEAD>Jakes Urges Changes In Communist Leadership, But Not Communist Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Milos Jakes
urged changes within the party to bring in younger members more
likely to initiate change, official media reports said today.
   But the hard-line leader said the government would not tolerate
street protests nor engage in dialogue with groups advocating that
Czechoslovakia abandon communism.
   Jakes spoke Sunday to a conference of official Communist youth
where speakers were unusually critical of the regime, accusing
leaders of losing the trust of Czechoslovakia's young people.
   ``We must introduce the new generation in the process of
change,'' Jakes told about 9OO delegates to the conference
sponsored by the Socialist Youth Union, the sole official
representative of young people in Czechoslovakia.
   The two-day session, which ended here Sunday, came at a time of
breathtaking reforms in neighboring East bloc countries and amid
increasing calls for changes in the Czechoslovak leadership.
   ``The cadre policy will probably constantly be subject to great
changes,'' because the older generation is ``leaving,'' the
official CTK news agency quoted Jakes as saying.
   Most of the country's leaders were installed after the
Soviet-led invasion that crushed the Prague Spring reforms of
Alexander Dubcek in 1968. They have been reluctant to implement the
kind of politicl changes sweeping the Soviet bloc from Moscow to
Berlin.
   Czechoslovakia, which enjoys one of the highest standards of
living of the seven Warsaw Pact nations, has taken one of the
hardest lines against dissent.
   Baton-wielding police in Prague last month dispersed up to
10,000 demonstrators who called for freedom and a new government,
highlighting major differences among the East-bloc allies on free
expression and reform.
   Jakes indicated this tough line would not change, saying, ``a
dialogue cannot be conducted ... through such street demonstrations
whose aim is to provoke, ... violate pubic order and ... to strive
in fact for abandoning'' communism, CTK reported.
   Pressure on Jakes, 67, and President Gustav Husak, 76, is
believed to be growing, analysts said. Husak served as Communist
Party leader after the Warsaw Pact invasion until December 1987
when Jakes replaced him.
   Communist youth leader Vasil Mohorita criticized the leadership
and said the government's course of ``restructuring'' which
foresees some economic changes but few political reforms ``does not
fit the expectations of young people,'' CTK reported.
   Some youths are losing faith in the possibility for communist
renewal, Mohorita said.
   ``The reason for the weakening of trust is that an atmosphere of
self-satisfaction has ruled in this country,'' he said, adding that
the party had covered up mistakes and refused to accept criticism.
   Jakes said a restructuring of the party apparatus had already
begun and pledged that it would continue.

   Two U.S. Navy jets mistakenly
dropped a dozen bombs about 300 yards from a campsite, leaving six
campers shaken, including one who was slightly injured by shrapnel.
   Two A-6 attack bombers from the Naval Air Facility in El Centro
accidentally dropped the round of explosives three miles north of
the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range, a Navy spokesman said
Sunday.
   ``It was definitely a mistake, but as to why I don't know,''
said Mike Ray, public affairs officer for the El Centro station.
Saturday's bombing was under investigation and Ray said he had no
further comment.
   The bombing left a half-dozen craters 10 to 12 feet in diameter
and about a foot deep.
   The jets apparently overshot the target area and dropped the
250-pound bombs, igniting small fires over four acres of the
California Desert Conservation Area, said Tom Biller, a U.S. Bureau
of Land Management ranger who investigated the accident Sunday with
Navy officials. The fires posed no threat in the desert scrubland.
   ``We're really lucky no one was seriously injured,'' said
Biller, of the bureau's Palm Springs office. The aircraft's bombs
came within 300 yards of the campsite before the error was detected
and the mission aborted, he said.
   ``It was unreal. It just pulverized the area,'' said George
Hurley, 46, an off-road motorcycle rider who was staying at the
campsite with five friends.
   Hurley, an Air Force veteran from Moreno Valley, said he and his
companions were about to make lunch when a plane passed overhead
and dropped the bombs.
   Hurley's brother-in-law, Bob Koch of Hacienda Heights, was
struck in the chest with shrapnel. Koch said the injury became
swollen, red and bruised.
   ``I'll tell you, it was the most frightening experience I've
ever had,'' said Koch.
   The camp site is about 150 miles southeast of downtown Los
Angeles.

<HEAD>Oil Company Agrees To $4 Million Settlement for Fuel Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil's pricetag for a massive fuel
spill into Pittsburgh's two rivers last year has risen to more than
$27 million with the latest settlement of $4 million for the state
of Pennsylvania.
   The Pittsburgh Press reported Sunday that Ashland reached
agreement with the state Department of Environmental Resources for
the $4 million payment to cover alleged violations of state
environmental law. The payment also covers damages to drinking
water, fish, waterfowl and other natural resources.
   More than 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel flowed into the
Monongahela and Ohio rivers when a storage tank ruptured at
Ashland's Floreffe Terminal in Jefferson, south of Pittsburgh, on
Jan. 2, 1988.
   The Ashland, Ky., company also has agreed to reimburse
Pennsylvania agencies for overtime expenses, equipment purchases
and other costs stemming from the spill under a separate settlement
not yet made public, the Press said.
   Officials said that sum would be in the six-figure range but
would not be more specific.
   The settlement would bring to about $27.25 million the amount
Ashland has spent or committed itself to spend on damage and
expense claims by individuals, businesses and government agencies,
on civil penalties, for a criminal fine and for cleanup.
   The figure consists of about $14 million for damages, expenses
and civil penalties, including the $4 million Pennsylvania
agreement; $11 million for cleanup; and $2.25 million for a
criminal fine.
   The company agreed to pay up to $16 million more under the terms
of a class-action settlement filed in U.S. District Court in
Pittsburgh last week.
   The costs haven't had a significant impact on the company's
finances, Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum said. Ashland had to pay a
$2.5 million deductible, but insurance covered the rest, he said.

<HEAD>Report: New Technique Helps Prevent Genetic Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who are carriers of genetic diseases may be
able to avoid bearing defective fetuses through a newly developed
technique for screening human eggs before fertilization, Chicago
researchers say.
   Under the process developed at the Reproductive Genetics
Institute of Illinois Masonic Medical Center, doctors remove eggs
from the woman's body as they would in any test-tube pregnancy.
   The eggs are inspected for mutations. Then, healthy eggs are
fertilized in a petri dish with sperm and returned to the woman's
womb.
   The technique was discovered by embryologist Yury Verlinsky,
director of the cell genetics laboratory, who said he was able to
spot mutations in human ova ready for in vitro fertilization.
   ``In the future,'' Verlinsky said, ``it could become routine for
those disorders for which there is a well-defined gene because it
decreases risk to an embryo.''
   A report on the technique was to be presented today at the
annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics in
Baltimore.
   ``This procedure is for couples who already know they're
carriers of genetic diseases but won't consider an abortion,'' said
Dr. Charles Strom, chief of medical genetics at the center. ``These
people already may have lost a child, or have an aversion to
abortion or the psychological trauma that can go along with it.''
   Current genetic tests are conducted after pregnancy and hold
some risk to the developing fetus.

<HEAD>Court Allows States to Ban Door-to-Door Solicitation for Funerals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed states to ban
door-to-door and telephone solicitation for pre-arranged funerals
and burial.
   The court, without comment, left intact a West Virginia law
challenged by a funeral service company as an infringement of
free-speech rights.
   The West Virginia Legislature in a 1983 law enacted extensive
new regulations of the funeral service industry.
   The law barred companies from making unsolicited sales pitches,
either door-to-door or over the phone, to potential customers.
   National Funeral Services Inc. sells pre-arranged, or pre-need,
funeral and burial services. The company is a West Virginia
subsidiary of Legacy One Inc., which owns funeral homes and
cemeteries througout the Southeast and Midwest.
   The company said it seeks to promote competition in the industry
by offering its services before they are needed.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last March said West
Virginia's ban on door-to-door and telemarketing sales does not
violate the free-speech protections of the Constitution's First
Amendment.
   The state has a legitimate interest in ``the protection of
consumers from overreaching and high-pressure sales tactics of this
most unique product,'' the 4th Circuit court said. ``West
Virginia's ban on solicitation is supported by the substantial
interest of protecting privacy.''
   The appeals court said the free-speech restrictions are minimal,
noting that the state permits direct-mail and newspaper
advertisements for funeral services.
   The Supreme Court on Oct. 2 left intact a similar Virginia law
prohibiting telephone solicitation for pre-arranged funerals.
   The case acted on today is National Funeral Services vs.
Rockefeller, 89-639.

<TEXT>
   The parting of the Berlin Wall has opened
floodgates of fear in Israel about a reunified Germany.
   Newspaper editorials, leading intellectuals and politicians all
expressed ambivalent feelings, welcoming the East Germans' new
freedom but questioning the dangers that could be posed if the two
Germanys ever reunited.
   ``Happiness at the Falling of the Wall. Suspicion Over
Reunification of Germany,'' read a banner headline in the
mass-circulation daily Yediot Ahronot.
   In an interview on Israel television late Sunday night, Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he foresees ``wide changes that will
certainly alter the map of the world very soon.''
   ``Of course, when we are speaking about Germany there is
something the Jewish nation has to say,'' added Shamir, whose
family was killed in the Nazi Holocaust. ``There are certain
sensitivities and for us it is a most serious problem.''
   Shamir's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, said today that Israel,
``like all the world, is following with great interest what is
taking place in the last few days in Europe in general and Germany
in particular. ... But we will wait and see what the outcome is and
where it leads.''
   Vice Premier Shimon Peres, who immigrated to Israel from Poland
during the rise of Nazi power in the 1930s, raised questions about
Germany's future in a television interview Sunday.
   ``On the one hand, what is happening there brings forth great
hope. On the other hand, no one among us is free of the memories of
the second World War,'' Peres said.
   ``When we hear of a united Germany, we must ask what kind of a
Germany it will be? A Germany with an army, without an army? A
demilitarized Germany, a undemilitarized Germany?''
   Yosef Lapid, writing in the conservative Maariv daily, said,
``We see the wave of history flooding Eastern Europe and find
ourselves divided between our human identity and our Jewish
destiny.''
   Maariv warned its readers in an editorial Sunday about ``the
grave danger that the German nation will begin again to toy with
the illusion that it is possible to try to destroy the world a
third time in less than 100 years.''
   Shlomo Aronson, a political scientist at the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem, said 45 percent of the 3.5 million Jews in Israel are
``Holocaust inspired or influenced,'' either because they are
survivors of the Holocaust or because their families were
devastated when the Nazis murdered 6 million Jews during World War
II.
   He said the older generation, which tends to be more
conservative, is especially fearful that a reunified Germany would
be dangerous.
   Fear of a reunified Germany is not limited to survivors of the
Holocaust, said Tamar Shoshan, a Berlin-born clinical psychologist
who works in Jerusalem with survivors and their children.
   ``The sensitivity to a large and strong Germany is the same for
all Jews. No one can escape the fact of what happened,'' she said.
   The Israeli doubts were evident Sunday at the dedication in
Jerusalem of a memorial to 200,000 Soviet Jewish soldiers who died
fighting Germany in World War II.
   ``I'm against reunification,'' said veteran Adolbert Fiksler,
62, whose parents, brother and sister were murdered in Nazi
concentration camps. ``It should be cut up into more pieces.''

   A small plane made an emergency landing with
its engine aflame on a freeway overpass and struck a car, but the
occupants of both the plane and the car escaped serious injury,
authorities said.
   Robert Gaugenmaier, 62, of Studio City, was flying the Cessna
210 when it developed engine trouble approaching Burbank Airport,
police Officer Jim Thompson said. Gaugenmaier's wife, Judith, 50,
was a passenger in the plane.
   The craft clipped a traffic light and, with its engine on fire,
was forced to land on the Sunland Avenue overpass of the Golden
State Freeway.
   ``I was looking for any place I could set it down,'' Gaugenmaier
told police after the 4 p.m. crash about one-half mile north of the
airport.
   Gaugenmaier's forehead was cut and his face, chest and arm were
bruised. Both he and his wife reported back pain, Thompson said.
The couple were treated at Pacifica Hospital of the Valley and
released Sunday night.
   Ioanna Jiminez, of Canyon Country, was driving the car hit by
the plane. Her 8-month-old son and 3-year-old daughter were with
her; her husband, Adolph, was following in a pickup truck.
   The car's front was damaged but the three were unhurt.
   ``I was screaming, `Stop the car, back up the car, pull over,'''
Adolph Jiminez said. ``I knew she couldn't hear me but I was
screaming out the window of the truck.''
   Other motorists who saw the crash helped remove the Gaugenmaiers
as flames poured from the engine.

<HEAD>Court To Consider Making Some Federal Tax Collection Easier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
making it easier to collect all federal taxes owed by bankrupt
corporations.
   At issue are government attempts to hold officials of bankrupt
corporations personally responsible for paying the owed taxes.
   The controversy stems from the two types of federal taxes owed
by employers _ ``trust fund'' and ``non-trust fund'' taxes _ and
the differing consequences of non-payments.
   Trust fund taxes are those withheld from employees' paychecks _
representing those employees' personal income taxes, unemployment
insurance and social security taxes.
   Should an employer fail to pay any trust fund taxes, the
government can collect an equivalent sum directly from the
officials who are responsible for collecting and paying them.
   An employer also may fail to pay its ordinary corporate income
taxes or other non-trust fund taxes _ those to be paid directly by
the corporation and not withheld or collected from someone else.
   The government generally cannot impose personal liability on
corporate officials if a corporation's non-trust fund taxes go
unpaid.
   A Massachusetts corporation called Energy Resources Co. filed
for bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 while owing about $1 million
in federal taxes, most of which were trust fund taxes.
   As part of its court-approved reorganization, the taxes owed by
Energy Resources were to be paid over four years. In making the
first payment, the bankruptcy trustee told the Internal Revenue
Service to apply it to trust-fund taxes owed.
   But the IRS refused, contending the payment could be applied to
the corporation's tax debt as the government agency chose.
   The same sequence of events occurred after a Rhode Island
corporation called Newport Offshore filed for bankruptcy
reorganization in 1985.
   Court documents did not indicate the business in which either
corporation was engaged.
   Federal judges in both states ruled that the IRS had to apply
the tax payments as specified, and those rulings were upheld last
March 31 by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court treated delinquent-tax payments by bankrupt
corporations as ``voluntary'' _ allowing the taxpayer to specify
how the money should be applied.
   Government lawyers say the IRS has the right to apply such
payments as it wants because they are ``involuntary.''
   The appeals court acknowledged that having the trust fund taxes
paid off first hurts the government's chances of collecting all the
money owed.
   ``If the reorganized corporation were to run out of money a few
years from now and trust fund debts were still owed, the government
might collect them from `responsible' individuals,'' the appeals
court said. ``But if all trust fund debts have been paid and if the
only debts are for, say, ordinary corporate income taxes, the
government will be out of luck, for there are no personal
guarantors of payment of a corporation's ordinary tax liabilities.''
   In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers told the
justices that if bankrupt corporations routinely are allowed to
designate how tax payments are to be applied, ``up to $34 million
per year in tax revenue could be lost.''
   The case is U.S. vs. Energy Resources, 89-255.

   Hundreds of thousands of pro-choice activists reveling in recent
electoral victories held demonstrations from President Bush's
vacation hometown in Maine and the Lincoln Memorial to a
celebrity-packed Los Angeles park.
   ``Today, we mark a new era in America. The 1990s will be the
decade of choice,'' declared Kate Michelman, president of the
National Abortion Rights League, at a rally Sunday in Rancho Park
in Los Angeles' Century City.
   Celebrities at the event included members of the cast of
NBC-TV's ``L.A. Law'' and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who exhorted the
crowd of more than 50,000 to ``fight for the right of
self-determination.''
   Also at the rally were entertainers Holly Hunter, Barbra
Streisand and Donna Mills, and Norma McCorvey, the Jane Roe of the
1973 abortion rights case known as ``Roe vs. Wade.''
   Many demonstrators around the country referred to the U.S.
Supreme Court's July 3 decision that let stand the landmark ruling
that legalized abortion but gave states broad authority to restrict
abortions.
   ``The Supreme Court did us a great favor,'' Mary Ann Baker of
Youngstown, Ohio, said at a rally in the nation's capital. ``It got
us off our complacent behinds.''
   In Washington, D.C., Democratic and Republican politicians and
entertainers headlined a rally by about 150,000 people at the steps
of the Lincoln Memorial.
   It was the largest of Sunday's events that began with a sunrise
service in Kennebunk, Maine, near President Bush's vacation retreat
in Kennebunkport. Some attracted small counter-demonstrations.
   Galvanized by election victories for abortion-rights supporters
in last week's gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey,
demonstrators said politicians would be forced to pay them heed in
the next round of elections.
   In San Francisco, 2,000 demonstrators played off Bush's campaign
comparison of private charity to ``a thousand points of light.'' A
park overlooking the city's downtown glowed at dusk as
demonstrators held up lights in support of the right to abortion.
   ``Here at dusk, we kindle a thousand points of light _ our own
thousand points of light _ to say that we will never again accept
the darkness of back alley despair,'' said Ms. Michelman, who went
to San Francisco after the Los Angeles rally.
   In Atlanta, hundreds waved coat hangers and posters during a
rally attended by congressmen and celebrities including actress
Marlo Thomas and magazine editor Gloria Steinem.
   ``Anti-choice is our Berlin Wall, and together, we will make it
fall forever,'' Ms. Steinem said.
   In Seattle, former congresswoman Bella Abzug took issue with the
anti-abortion position that life begins at the moment of conception.
   ``I don't know when the moment of conception begins,'' she said.
``My friend Marlo Thomas has said maybe it begins when you say, `Hi
ya, honey.'''
   Many of the 1,000 abortion activists in Columbia, S.C., said
lawmakers who try to restrict abortions should be tossed from
office.
   ``We must get rid of the politicians who would restrict our
choices in so private an area,'' said Columbia attorney Victoria
Eslinger.
   In New Orleans, a brass band and gospel groups warmed up about
1,800 abortion-rights advocates at the City Park.
   In New York state, demonstrators in Rochester donned purple
ribbons, a symbol of the suffragette movement, and about 300 people
marched in Watertown in support of abortion rights.
   In North Dakota, many demonstrators carried signs declaring
``Mobilize for Women's Lives'' and ``It's My Body ... and Keep Your
Laws Off It.'' Demonstrators in Bismark gathered by the Capitol
steps, while in Fargo they marched to a replica of the Statue of
Liberty.
   In Chicago, more than 2,500 activists held a silent march from a
Southwest Side church to Cook County Hospital, urging resumption of
abortion services at the county-run medical center. Feminist Betty
Friedan was among those who spoke.
   In Missouri, where the case in the July Supreme Court decision
originated, more than 5,000 marched in Jefferson City. State
Treasurer Wendell Bailey, a Republican expected to run for governor
in 1992, sought to seize the issue from Democrats, traditionally
considered more likely to support abortion rights.
   ``This is not a Republican-Democrat issue. It's far above
partisan politics,'' said Bailey, who evoked the title of the
landmark Supreme Court case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services.
   ``We have a chance to de-Websterize Missouri,'' Baily shouted.

<TEXT>
   Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who has been a
voice of moderaton through 14 years of civil war, returns to the
prime minister's office for the fourth time in 13 years to try to
end the fighting.
   The 59-year-old economist, designated by President Rene Mouawad
on Monday to form a new government, is a firm backer of democracy,
a free-wheeling economy and Christian-Moslem coexistence. He is
married to a Christian.
   Formidable obstacles stand before Hoss as he attempts to head a
government slated to introduce political reforms giving the Moslem
majority an equal share of power with the dominant Christian
minority.
   Foremost is the defiant Christian army commander, Gen. Michel
Aoun, who insists that a three-man interim military Cabinet he
headed for the past 13 months is the sole legitimate authority in
Lebanon.
   Hoss' main asset is the wide respect he commands among
Christians and Moslems. Even the caustic Aoun spared Hoss in his
tirades against local, Arab and foreign leaders.
   ``He is a clean and honest man whom I respect,'' Aoun once said
of Hoss during the height of the general's ``war of liberation'' to
drive Syria's 40,000 troops from Lebanon.
   Hoss' previous tenure in office began June 2, 1987, a day after
Prime Minister Rashid Karami was assassinated. Hoss was named
acting prime minister by President Amin Gemayel.
   Hoss, who served as education minister under Karami for three
years, clashed with Aoun when Gemayel named the general head of an
interim military Cabinet on Sept. 22, 1988, the day Gemayel's
six-year term expired and Parliament was unable to agree on a
successor.
   Moslems pledged allegiance to Hoss, who eventually tendered the
resignation of his Cabinet when Mouawad was elected president Nov.
5.
   Hoss was born Dec. 20, 1929, to a middle-class Sunni family in
west Beirut. His father died while he was very young and the family
sacrificed heavily to see him through his studies at the American
University of Beirut.
   After graduating in 1952 with a degree in economics and business
administration, he worked for the American-owned Trans-Arabian
Pipeline Co.
   He then transferred to the Beirut Chamber of Commerce in 1954,
where his future wife, Leila Pharoan, worked as his secretary.
   In 1955, Hoss left the Chamber of Commerce to teach at the
American University and to continue his studies. He received his
masters in 1957, the same year he married.
   Christian-Moslem marriages were very rare in Lebanon at the
time. Mrs. Hoss has been quoted as saying her parents strongly
opposed the union, ``But they gave in when Salim and I convinced
them nothing can break our marriage.''
   The tall, balding, bespectacled Hoss does not smoke or drink and
normally goes to bed early. He prefers Oriental food and likes to
spend evenings listening to classical music.
   The couple left for the United States in 1959, where Hoss
obtained a doctorate in economics and business administration from
the the University of Indiana at Bloomington.
   His only child, daughter Wadad, 30, was born in the United
States.
   On his return to Lebanon, Hoss taught business management at the
American University of Beirut, and from 1964 to 1966 he worked in
Kuwait as financial adviser to the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development.
   He returned to the university in 1966, but the following year
his close friend, Elias Sarkis, became governor of Lebanon's first
banking commission.
   The banking system had been shaken by the crash of Intra Bank,
then Lebanon's largest, and Hoss and Sarkis worked together to
shore up the system.
   With this accomplished by 1973, Hoss was appointed chairman and
general manager of Lebanon's semi-public Development Bank.
   He remained at this post until Sarkis, who had been elected
president, named him prime minister in December 1976, 19 months
after the outbreak of the civil war.

<TEXT>
   A Detroit Free Press reporter and a Pulitzer
Prize-winning photographer have been suspended after revealing that
the photographer bought items from a drug addict who was a source
for a report on drugs.
   Photographer Manny Crisostomo bought a Sony Walkman and a
sausage from a crack addict referred to as Tim in a story
accompanied by photographs published Oct. 15, according to Free
Press executives.
   Crisostomo said he bought the items because he was afraid the
addict might become violent. The addict used the money to buy
crack, Executive Editor Heath J. Meriwether said.
   Crisostomo was suspended without pay for three days and reporter
Pat Chargot for two days for ``violating ethical standards,''
Meriwether said in a memo distributed to the staff Friday.
   In the memo, Meriwether said Chargot revealed the purchases
Monday as she was working on a follow-up story. The story was
canceled.
   Crisostomo and Chargot originally told their editors that Tim
asked for money but they refused. The story said the addict begged
for money but wasn't given any.
   ``This serious breach of ethics is painful for everybody at this
newspaper who, like Chargot and Crisostomo, poured themselves into
that project and were extremely proud of it. All of us suffer for
this mistake,'' Meriwether said in Saturday's newspaper.
   Crisostomo won a Pulitzer Prize in April for photos that
documented a year in the life of Detroit's Southwestern High
School. Crisostomo and Chargot did not return phone calls made to
their homes.

<HEAD>Court Allows Arizona to Tax River Raft Trips</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed Arizona to tax
the river raft trips a Salt Lake City business runs through Grand
Canyon National Park in Arizona.
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that the
tax is unconstitutional.
   Moki Mac River Expeditions in Salt Lake City operates river
rafting adventures in several western states. One such trip is on
the Colorado River through Arizona. Moki Mac pays the National Park
Service a fee for use of the park areas.
   Arizona tax officials in 1983 told Moki Mac it must pay a
transaction privilege tax for doing business in their state. Moki
Mac protested, contending that the tax violated the Constitution's
ban on undue state interference with interestate commerce.
   A state judge ruled that the tax is invalid because Moki Mac
does not have enough business contacts with Arizona.
   The Utah company rents a two-acre lot in Arizona, on which it
maintains a storage building and a dwelling where Moki Mac
employees stay between trips.
   An Arizona appeals court reversed the judge's ruling and upheld
the tax.
   ``The state maintains the highways over which Moki Mac's
employees and customers must travel to and from the trip sites,''
the state appeals court said. ``Moki Mac enjoys police protection
for its leased property and for its employees who seasonally reside
in its leased dwellings.''
   Under a 1977 Supreme Court decision, a state tax imposed on
interstate commerce is valid if it:
   _Is applied to an activity with a substantial connection with
the taxing state.
   _Is fairly apportioned.
   _Does not discriminate against interstate commerce.
   _Is fairly related to the services provided by the state.
   The Arizona appeals court said the tax on Moki Mac passed all
four tests, rejecting among other things the company's allegations
that the tax is not fairly apportioned.
   Noting that Utah does not tax Moki Mac's Grand Canyon rafting
trips, the appeals court said, ``No apportionment is required now
because multiple taxation has not been shown to exist.''
   If Utah starts to tax the raft trips, the appeals court said,
``The two states will have to fairly apportion the tax on Moki
Mac's business activities.''
   The Arizona Supreme Court refused to hear Moki Mac's appeal last
June 13.
   The case is Moki Mac River Expeditions vs. Arizona Department of
Revenue, 89-405.

<TEXT>
   The Pakistan Foreign Ministry
summoned India's ambassador today to express Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's concern about plans by Indian Hindus to build a temple at
a site held sacred by Moslems.
   A brief statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said Indian
High Commissioner J.N. Dixid assured the Pakistanis his government
had taken steps to protect the sanctity of the site.
   At the same time, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi today told
foreign countries to stay out of the dispute. He did not refer to
any particular country but said ``interference was aimed at
fomenting'' sectarian violence in India, United News of India
reported.
   On Sunday, an Indian magistrate temporarily blocked the Hindus'
plans to build the temple at the site of the 17th century Babri
Masjid, or Mosque of Babar, in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya.
   The dispute has prompted a number of demonstrations in Moslem
Pakistan, India's western neighbor.
   Officials said two people were injured Sunday in the southern
Pakistani city of Sukkur when police fired tear gas at youths
protesting the arrest of 27 people the day before for allegedly
damaging two Hindu temples and three Hindu-owned shops.
   Demonstrators chanted and burned effigies of Gandhi in other
Pakistani cities, but authorities said the protests generally were
peaceful.
   Hindus comprise less than 2 percent of Pakistan's 107 million
people. The overwhelming majority are Moslems.
   Indian Foreign Ministry officials accused Ms. Bhutto of
``malicious meddling'' in the country's internal affairs when she
condemned construction of the Ayodhya temple on Saturday.
   About 300 people have been killed in Hindu-Moslem violence in
three Indian states since August when plans for the temple were
announced.
   Pakistan was carved out of mainly-Hindu India at the end of
British colonial rule in 1947. The countries have fought each other
three times since then, with India emerging the victor.

   An optometrist says he plans to appeal
an administrative decision putting him on probation for having some
women patients strip to the waist during eye exams.
   The Iowa Board of Optometry Examiners last month placed Gary
Fisher on three years' probation and ordered him to stop asking
patients to strip to the waist during examinations.
   Fisher said he was checking for scoliosis, or curvature of the
spine, because he thought it was linked to some eye disorders.
   The board said ``the evidence did not show there was any
voyeuristic or any other kind of sexual motivation.''
   Fisher's lawyer, John McClintock of Des Moines, said the board's
decision will be appealed in Polk County District Court.
   Fisher said the board members ``succumbed to the contamination
of the judicial process by political medicine and the
sensationalistic media.''

   An Atlanta man was charged today with killing a
7-year-old boy and injuring three other young people in a drive-by
shooting that apparently stemmed from an argument over drugs.
   The boy was one of several apparently innocent victims of
drug-related shootings around the nation during the weekend.
   Terrell Weaver, 7, died after being shot in the chest while
playing in a yard in southwest Atlanta on Sunday night, Atlanta
Police Detective Geraldine Champion said.
   Glenn Weems, 39, of Atlanta, surrendered to police about 3:30
a.m. Police said he is charged with one count of murder and three
counts of aggravated assault.
   Three other victims, ranging in age from 2 to 17, were listed in
stable condition at Grady Memorial Hospital with gunshot wounds,
according to the hospital's night administrator, John Hester.
   The shooting took place in an area known for heavy drug traffic,
and Weems had argued with the father of one of the children earlier
Sunday night, apparently about drugs, according to police.
   In New York, authorities arrested a suspect in the shooting of a
New Jersey woman who was killed as she drove with her 4-year-old
son through a drug-infested area of Harlem.
   Janet Pierro, 33, of Weehawken, N.J., was driving a rental car
early Sunday when a man approached and firet.
   No charges were immediately filed in the case.

   The builder of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker's
Heritage USA is asking supporters of the failed PTL ministry for
millions of dollars to buy the Christian retreat, and he says the
Bakkers don't fit into his plans.
   Roe Messner, president of Commercial Builders of Kansas and a
builder of churches nationwide, told about 25 people in Orlando
Saturday he wants to offer $50 million to $55 million to a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the property.
   Messner told the Orlando group, gathered in a motel room about a
mile from the Shoppers World mall where the Bakkers set up a church
six months ago, that he needs a $2 million commitment from PTL
supporters by Nov. 25.
   He stressed that while he is a friend of the Bakkers, he has not
discussed his plans with them.
   ``This has nothing to do with Jim and Tammy whatsoever,'' he
said.
   Messner said he is concentrating on the PTL's ``lifetime
partners,'' people who gave money, usually $1,000, in exchange for
promises of annual lodging for life at Heritage USA.
   Tammy Bakker preached to about 75 people at couple's storefront
church on Sunday. She blamed hate-filled ``surface Christians'' for
the downfall of the Bakkers' multimillion-dollar ministry.
   Mrs. Bakker cried as she told of her husband's weekend phone
call from a federal prison in Rochester, Minn., where he is serving
a 45-year sentence for fraud and conspiracy.
   ``He said, `Honey, it's so bleak here,''' she recalled. ``I
asked the Lord today to put some sunlight in Minnesota.''

   The AFL-CIO opened its biennial convention
today, savoring its role in the success of Poland's Solidarity
union and determined to end what may be the American labor
movement's worst decade on a positive note.
   In his keynote address this morning, Lane Kirkland, president of
the labor federation, invoked the convention theme of solidarity in
promising a rebound for labor in the 1990s.
   ``Solidarity has been our shield against the most primitive and
the most sophisticated attacks by the agents of avarice and
exploitation,'' Kirkland said, sounding a more militant stance
toward future organizing and bargaining.
   ``We will not take no for a permanent answer,'' he said. ``And
we will not pull away from any struggle.''
   Kirkland also invoked the words of his predecessor, George
Meany, in defining labor's objective.
   ``The key role of the trade union is to see that the big guys
don't kick the little guys around,'' Kirkland told the more than
900 delegates. ``They need it now more than ever when the legacy of
the Reagan years exacting its cost in all walks of life.''
   Delegates to the 14.1 million-member federation's convention
will have a busy week: welcoming Solidarity leader Lech Walesa,
plotting future support for several major strikes and hearing from
a U.S. president for the first time in a decade.
   Also on tap are addresses by Democratic congressional leaders
and the election of the federation's officers, with Kirkland a
shoo-in for a sixth two-year term as president.
   Walesa's appearance to thank U.S. unions for their support in
Solidarity's struggle will be by far the most captivating public
event.
   Walesa will finally receive the George Meany Human Rights Award,
which the union bestowed on him eight years ago. He was not allowed
to leave Poland to receive it.
   Labor leaders will meet privately with Walesa to determine how
the AFL-CIO can assist Solidarity now that Poland has a
sympathetic, non-communist government, and how to emulate the
success of the Polish labor movement in other European countries,
such as East Germany, Hungary and Lithuania.
   ``We don't have to seek out our clients,'' Kirkland said in an
interview last week. ``They come to us. We are, in spite of what
our detractors say in this country, the largest, in many ways the
strongest, the most unified and the most deeply involved trade
union federation around the world.''
   The federation provided Solidarity with an estimated $5 million
worth of communications and other equipment and support.
   ``Wherever working people are trying to lift themselves up and
form free trade associations, they always come to us for help,''
Kirkland said. ``As these movements are developing in central and
Eastern Europe we are going to have increasing demands upon us and
we'll do our best to respond.''
   The celebration of the success abroad comes at a time of
uncertainty at home for the labor movement, which has struggled
throughout the 1980s with the losses in the industrial sector _ its
traditional organizing strength _ and its battle with the Reagan
administration over issues ranging from the minimum wage to child
care to plant closings.
   Kirkland just a month ago referred to President Bush as ``Reagan
Lite,'' but last week said the president's willingness to strike a
compromise on raising the minimum wage showed there had been some
improvement over the strained relations with the Reagan White House.
   ``We have channels of communication that I think are superior to
those that we had during the Reagan years,'' he said. ``Things are
not so ideologically hostile.''
   Bush has agreed to address the convention Wednesday.
   Reagan refused to speak in 1981 and was never invited again.
Jimmy Carter was the last president to address a federation
convention, in 1979.
   The celebration of Walesa's first visit to the United States
will be coupled with welcoming back the United Mine Workers,
rejoining the federation 40 years after the legendary John L. Lewis
pulled out because of a political fight.
   The reception of the UMW, however, also serves to underscore the
renewed move toward militancy by major unions.
   The UMW's strike against Pittston Coal Group is one of four that
will receive the attention of the delegates, beginning today when
the convention's theme of Solidarity is underscored by a procession
of workers on strike against Pittston, Eastern Airlines, NYNEX
Corp. and Boeing.
   Kirkland and other labor leaders believe unions have turned the
corner in organizing the growth sectors of the economy _
particularly health care and the service industries _ but
increasingly are supporting hard-line stands to prevent further
erosion of labor's numbers in the areas of its traditional strength.
   ``I think we're coming out of a very difficult period in
remarkably good shape and with the highest degree of internal
solidarity and cohesiveness than we've ever had,'' Kirkland said in
the interview.
   In his report to the delegates, however, he sounded a more
strident and militant note: ``If we are to advance in this hostile
climate, there is only one way for trade unionists to turn, and
that is to each other.''

   A Rhode Island congresswoman today led a
deputy to national drug czar William Bennett through a housing
project that is being touted as a success story in the war on drugs.
   ``This (project) is a clear example of leadership _ cooperation
among tenants ... and pride,'' said Rep. Claudine Schneider,
R-R.I., after officials presented a 15-minute videotape about the
Galago Court Housing Project's $6 million renovation.
   Housing project residents peered out of their doors as the
government officials and reporters pulled up for a news conference
and tour. Some joked about their status as a success story.
   ``How many times have we seen this?'' one tenant asked as the
tape was shown.
   Judge Reggie Walton, deputy director of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy, praised the housing authority's efforts.
   ``Any initiative regarding public housing has to take into
account the drug and crime problem,'' Walton said.
   Galago Court will receive an award from the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development for the improvements during the past
three years there, Schneider said.
   The videotape outlined the 164-unit project's crime problems
before the renovations, including seven drug-related deaths in
seven years. The tape mentioned the ``cocaine dealers, thieves and
night people'' that frequented the area.
   Galago Court now has a security post at the entrance and
stricter review of those seeking apartments to keep dealers and
criminals from renting there. The review includes checking the
applicants' names with police records.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether public school boards and school officials may be sued in
state court, not only in federal court, for allegedly violating a
student's rights.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by a former Florida
high school student who says his rights were violated when an
assistant principal broke into his car parked on school grounds in
1986.
   The student, Mark Howlett, later was suspended from St.
Petersburg High School for five days for having alcoholic beverages
in the car.
   Howlett and his mother, Elizabeth Howlett, accused the Pinellas
County school board and school officials of violating a federal
civil rights law enacted in 1871.
   A state appeals court dismissed the suit on grounds the state
had not surrendered immunity for school boards and officials.
   School officials and school boards _ as state agents _ enjoy
broad but not absolute protection from federal lawsuits. The
Supreme Court has ruled that local governments and their officials
may be sued under the 1871 law only if it can be proved the alleged
violation of civil rights is part of an official policy.
   The Howlett case gives the high court an opportunity to set
guidelines for such suits in state courts.
   Assistant principal Thomas Petit entered Howlett's locked
Volkswagen by pushing in a side window. The car was blocking a
construction site at the school, and Petit and others were tyring
to move it.
   Once inside the car, Petit said he found three empty wine cooler
bottles and another bottle containing alcoholic eggnog.
   Students are forbidden from taking alcohol onto school grounds.
Howlett was criminally charged with illegal possession of alcohol
on school property.
   The charge was dismissed by a judge but Howlett also was
suspended from school for five days, causing him automatically to
get failing grades for part of a school term.
   He later graduated from the high school and enrolled at St.
Petersburg Junior College.
   A Florida appeals court last Feb. 1 dismissed the civil rights
suit filed by Howlett and his mother.
   The appeals court said, ``The state has not waived its sovereign
immunity from suits against it in its own state courts'' in such
cases.
   The state court said ground rules established by the Supreme
Court ``are all distinguishable because they deal primarily with
...immunity ...in federal courts.''
   The case is Howlett vs. Rose, 89-5383.

   Postmaster General Anthony Frank presented
President Bush with a letter carrier's cap and bag today as a
tribute to Bush's prolific letter-writing, then delivered a jesting
notice about the bill to taxpayers for the postage.
   ``One of the traits for which you've become well known is
writing brief congratulatory thank-you messages,'' Frank told Bush
after the president gave opening remarks to an international postal
conclave.
   ``In fact, during your first year as the nation's chief
executive, you've generated more personal correspondence than many
other presidents during their entire administrations,'' Frank added.
   ``I'd like to point out, that every one of those has been
franked,'' said the postmaster general. A postal frank is free
postage provided by the taxpayers for the president and for members
of Congress.
   Bush, in his speech to the Universal Postal Union, noted that
``every week, I receive up to 60,000 letters from every state in
the union and from nearly every country in the world. You can get a
lot of free advice in this job.''
   The president also rattled off a few anecdotes of U.S. postal
history, including: ``In 1916, a 40,000-ton brick building was
mailed across Utah, brick by brick, because it was cheaper than the
freight charges.''
   But Frank later told the audience: ``I hope that people don't
remember your brick story. We really can't afford that.''

<HEAD>Governor Describes Kitty Dukakis' Drinking Rubbing Alcohol as `A
Slip'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVE EPSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis today described his wife's
ingestion of rubbing alcohol as ``a slip'' and said decisions would
be made in the next few days about further treatment for her.
   Kitty Dukakis is a recovering alcoholic who has received
treatment for chemical dependency. ``Slip'' is a term used by
recovering alcoholics to describe a lapse back into drinking.
   ``Obviously my principal concern is making sure Kitty has the
opportunity to pursue her recovery with some privacy and some
space,'' said Dukakis, briefing reporters about his wife's health.
``The important thing is to get back on track.''
   The governor also said he had visited his wife at Brigham and
Women's Hospital today and that ``she is feeling much better.'' He
refused to answer reporters' questions.
   Dukakis said no decisions had been made yet as to further
treatment, but his wife would make them after consultation with her
doctors. ``Recovery is a lifelong process,'' he said.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, was brought to Brigham and Women's hospital by
ambulance Nov. 6. Her doctor said she suffered a ``severe
reaction'' from drinking rubbing alcohol.
   Experts on alcoholism say it is not unusual for an alcoholic to
drink rubbing alcohol, hair spray or other products containing
alcohol when the craving hits and liquor is not available.
   Hospital officials referred all calls about Mrs. Dukakis'
condition to the governor's press office. Last week, her doctor,
Gerald Plotkin, said Mrs. Dukakis was ``completely out of danger.''
   Dukakis' press secretary, Mindy Lubber, said today she did not
know when Mrs. Dukakis would be released.
   Plotkin said shortly after she was hospitalized that Mrs.
Dukakis was taking prescription anti-depressants. But Plotkin said
no other drugs, medication, or alcoholic beverages were involved in
her recent hospitalization.
   Mrs. Dukakis was treated for alcoholism at a Rhode Island
treatment center in March. At the beginning of her husband's
presidential campaign, Mrs. Dukakis disclosed a 26-year addiction
to diet pills.
   Plotkin said fall has always been a bad time for Mrs. Dukakis,
who has suffered from depression for years.

   The government plans a major crackdown on
prostitution and ``other repulsive deeds,'' China's top security
official was quoted as saying Monday.
   Public Security Minister Wang Fang said the wide-ranging program
will punish all who copy or sell pornography; engage in
prostitution; produce, sell or use drugs; gamble, or conduct
superstitious activities for a profit.
   ``Foreign visitors will also be punished if they are found to be

   Wang did not disclose details of the planned sweep but said it
would go into effect soon.
   ``It has got to the point that such bad things must be wiped
out,'' Xinhua quoted Liu Gan, secretary general of the State
Council, China's Cabinet, as saying.
   Chinese prosecutors have approved the arrests of 11,503
criminals involved in such illegal activities in the first nine
months of 1989, Xinhua said.

   A federal advisory panel said today it has
approved evacuation plans for Massachusetts communities near the
Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant and recommended that the
embattled facility receive a full-power license.
   The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board overruled the objections
of Massachusetts officials and environmental groups and said
evacuation plans for residents of six northeastern Massachusetts
communities are adequate to protect public safety.
   The board also ruled that an evacuation exercise conducted last
year in Massachusetts and New Hampshire ``was adequate in scope and
revealed no fundamental flaw.''
   Although Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon can appeal
the decision within 10 days, the $6.3 billion reactor could receive
a full-power license even before the appeals run their course, said
Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman John Kopeck. Seabrook
officials have said they expect the plant to be licensed around the
first of next year.
   The next step in the complex process involves a 30-day review
period by the NRC, a public hearing held by the full commission at
which the NRC staff makes its recommendations on the plant and a
final decision on issuing a license by the commission.
   Shannon has already said he would appeal a ruling by the
licensing board to the higher-level Atomic Safety and Licensing
Appeal Board and from there to the full NRC. If, as Shannon said he
expects, the NRC decides to issue a full-power license, he has said
he will challenge that ruling in federal court.
   Completion of the plant was delayed by nearly a decade by legal
challenges by environmentists, cost overruns, changes required
during construction and financial problems encountered by the
facility's principal owner, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire.
   The plant originally was projected to cost $1 billion and go
into service in 1979.
   In its 571-page ruling dated Nov. 9 and made public today, the
three-member licensing board found ``reasonable assurance that
adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of
a radiological emergency at the Seabrook station, in accordance
with the commission's emergency planning regulations and precedents
....''
   The licensing board cleared away another potential obstacle to
swift issuance of a full-power license by ruling that a recent
appeal board decision on the New Hampshire evacuation plans posed
no major problem in the licensing process.
   Several flaws in the New Hampshire plans found by the appeal
board, ``do not preclude the immediate issuance of an operating
license for the Seabrook station,'' the board said.
   Plant spokesman Ron Sher called the decision a ``major
development that brings Seabrook closer to a full-power license.''
   He added: ``The emergency plans for Seabrook have been evaluated
by the experts _ the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the staff
of the NRC and the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards _ and
their conclusions are that Seabrook's emergency plans are among the
best in the country.''
   Sher said that only in the event of a highly unlikely site
emergency or general emergency at the plant would the plans
involving warning sirens, radio broadcasts and possible evacuation
of school children, residents and tourists swing into action.
   The evacuation plans for Massachusetts involve six communities
in the northeastern corner of the state, just south of the Seabrook
plant: Amesbury, Merrimack, Newbury, Newburyport, Salisbury and
West Newbury. Total population of the region is about 50,000 with a
peak of about 90,000 during the summer months.

<HEAD>Respondents Say Gorbachev Most Responsible for Wall's Demise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans and West Germans give Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev the most credit for the moves that
led to the opening of the Berlin Wall last week, new polls say, but
skepticism remains strong about the future of reform in Eastern
Europe.
   Polls in the United States and West Germany conducted for USA
Today found citizens in both countries are splintered over whether
reforms should lead to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Europe.
   Asked who should get the most credit for bringing about the
opening of the Berlin Wall, West Germans were emphatic: 70 percent
named the Soviet leader. Gorbachev was most often named by
Americans as well, picked by 43 percent.
   Among Germans, East German leader Egon Krenz was named by six
percent; West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl by 5 percent; President
Bush, 3 percent; and former President Reagan, 2 percent. Among
Americans, Reagan was picked by 14 percent; Krenz, 9 percent; Kohl,
6 percent; and Bush, 5 percent. The remainder in both cases named
others or did not give a choice.
   The poll in the United States was conducted by telephone by
Gordon S. Black Corp., and is based on interviews with 805 adults.
   The poll in West Germany is based on interviews with 1,005
adults and was conducted by EMNID Institut. The U.S. poll has a
sampling error margin of 4 percentage points. The Germany survey
has a 3 percentage point margin.
   Citizens of both countries are optimistic about the changes in
East Germany, but a substantial number of Germans think the
Communists will crack down. Fifty-one percent of the West Germans
think recent events in the East are the beginning of an open
society, but 39 percent said the communists are ``buying time
before a crackdown.''
   Among Americans, 70 percent think the moves are the beginning of
an open society and only 15 percent expect a crackdown. The rest in
each case didn't know.
   Asked whether the United States should withdraw its troops from
Europe if the reforms continue, half of the Americans and 42
percent of the Germans said U.S. troop levels should not be
changed. Forty-four percent of the Americans and 52 percent of the
Germans said at least some reductions should be made in troop
levels.

<HEAD>Government Bodyguards Increase With Security Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More government officials are using bodyguards
for protection these days, although some Cabinet members still
prefer to travel around town with only a driver or an aide,
according to an informal survey.
   In general, security for top officials has been beefed up during
the 1980s, a decade punctuated by terrorist threats and activities
like the bombing of Pam Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
last December.
   Bodyguards are just one manifestation of the heightened security.
   ``There's been a big upsurge in security,'' said Chuck Vance, a
former Secret Service agent who now runs a $20 million-a-year
security company, Vance International. ``There's been an increased
concern.''
   For instance, several months ago threats from Colombian drug
cartels reportedly prompted President Bush to order an increase in
Secret Service protection for some of his children.
   And William Bennett, director of the nation's drug policy,
receives protection from the U.S. Marshals Services, a part of the
Justice Department.
   ``Certainly there is a threat to be considered as far as Dr.
Bennett's work is concerned,'' said Bill Dempsey, a spokesman for
the service.
   The marshals' function is to provide security for the judiciary,
including federal judges and juries, but they protect others like
Bennett when ordered to do so by the attorney general, Dempsey said.
   A check of several agencies revealed a broad range of personal
security, from the knot of Secret Service agents protecting Bush to
the single staff aide who goes around town with Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole or the driver who accompanies Jack Kemp, the
secretary of housing and urban development.
   Many agencies are reluctant to talk about the security provided
officials for fear of attracting unwanted attention. The Secret
Service, with its $364 million budget and 1,900 special agents,
only discusses security in broad terms.
   The cost to the taxpayer of providing round-the-clock protection
is also difficult to determine because it is often included in an
overall security budget, officials say.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner oversees an office of 19
security people with a budget of $4.1 million, according to
spokesman Bob Marx. But protecting Skinner is only one of the
officers' duties, Marx said.
   They also do criminal investigations, make security checks on
new employees and supervise the system that protects the building
from penetration by eavesdropping devices.
   There is some debate over the value of bodyguards.
   While Vance favors a wide range of preventive measures _
security systems in houses and concrete barriers to buildings, to
name a few _ he said the ``bodyguard business sometimes gets
overdone.''
   Trained security agents can deter trouble, too many guards can
be counterproductive, he said. ``You will attract nuts if there is
a big security splash.''
   The Secret Service, part of the Treasury Department, protects
the president, the vice president, their immediate families,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, presidential candidates and
visiting heads of state.
   While the bodyguard function is important, he said the agents'
major task is to secure a public area, the advance work.
   ``Security is taking away the opportunity to harm,'' Vance said.
If an assailant gets too close, there's little a bodyguard can do
other than ``damage control,'' he said. Thus, when former President
Reagan was shot in March 1981, agents pushed him into a car which
sped to the hospital.
   Most officials rely on security details inside their agencies
for protection.
   CIA Director William Webster has plain-clothed men from his
agency who stand at the entrance of the tennis court for Webster's
7 a.m. games. When he visits friends in Georgetown, the agents stay
outside in a parked car.
   The FBI, part of the Justice Department, takes care of
Thornburgh and FBI Director William Sessions, and Secretary of
State James Baker III and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney have
details from their agencies.
   The Supreme Court has its own armed security force, although the
justices are among the most inconspicuous officials in Washington.
   ``They're low-key people,'' said Toni House, the court's
spokeswoman. The justices, however, can receive protection from
their own agents or the marshals should they want it, she said.
   At the Department of Health and Human Services, there are five
security guards, some of whom ensure the safety of Secretary Louis
Sullivan, according to a security official who spoke on condition
he not be named.
   Because he supervises the government's work on a number of
touchy subjects from AIDS research to abortion, Sullivan and former
HHS secretaries have been targets for threats, the official said.
Otis Bowen, who preceded Sullivan, received 40 threats in his last
13 months in office, he said.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos has no security detail, but an
administrative aide doubles as his protection.

   East German news media, once dull purveyors of
Communist Party propaganda, gave full coverage to the frenzy and
frolic of the historic weekend party as thousands of Berliners
celebrated on both sides of the border.
   The national broadcast network showed East Germans peeking into
sex shops in Hamburg's famed Reeperbahn Red Light District, and
radio brought the sound of popping corks and crashing glass as
revelers celebrated with champagne atop the Berlin Wall.
   Viewers watched their countrymen lining up for visas at border
crossings and clogging central streets with a sea of smoke-spewing
compacts, all pointed toward the newly opened gates through the
Berlin Wall.
   East Germany suspended all travel curbs late Thursday, under
pressure from a broad democracy movement, and the newly reformed
press stepped in to record the moment.
   Enterprising East German reporters interviewed the West-bound
countrymen, roaming the visa queues to inquire about individual
dreams or plans of visits abroad.
   ``Events of historic proportions,'' declared the Neue Zeit
newspaper at the top of its front page Monday, with pictures of
happy travelers streaming out and the graffiti-splattered west side
of the wall.
   ``A border that doesn't divide,'' claimed Der Morgan, another
newspaper aligned with officialdom.
   Less than a month ago the airwaves and periodicals were drab
organs of party propaganda, with dull diatribes against the
decadent West and self-congratulating claims of socialist
superiority.
   TV coverage lacked the sparkle of Western broadcasts, but the
frank and supportive reports would have been unthinkable less than
a month ago.
   Cameras captured the breadth of the backup of sputtering
Trabants and Wartburgs filling Unter den Linden as the freed
tourists headed West.
   Radio and the state news agency ADN gave regular updates on the
numbers of citizens crossing out for a look at the long-forbidden
other Germany.
   Even Neues Deutschland, the comparatively stubborn Communist
Party daily, reported Monday that 4.3 million visas had been issued
since Thursday.
   But the main party organ led its front page with reports on a
Central Committee session and leader Egon Krenz's telephone chat
with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

   Vice President Dan Quayle said
today that the eventual reunification of Germany is inevitable and
that when it comes, the rejoined nation will be ``allied with the
forces of freedom and democracy, which is the West.''
   ``... East Germany is East Germany because of the communist
system,'' Quayle said. ``Do away with the communist system and it's
Germany.''
   The vice president told the Republican Governors Association
that the GOP has delivered on the issues of peace and opportunity
in the 1980s and that it is no accident that ``the forces of
freedom and democracy are on the march in Eastern Europe.''
   He said it is Democrats, not President Bush, who have been timid
in dealing with change at home and abroad, because all they want to
do is spend more money.
   ``The Democrats haven't offered one creative idea on how to
manage the evolving situation in Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union
except to criticize the president,'' Qualye told a group of
reporters later. He said the administration has been properly
cautious but still ``out front on this issue.''
   In Germany, where the East German government has opened the
Berlin Wall permitting free travel to the West and has promised
elections, ``Eventually you will see reunification,'' Quayle said
in the interview. ``It's going to take some time.''
   He said that reunification would not mean the elimination of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact but would
require a change in the responsibilities of those military
alliances, in Western relations with the Soviet bloc and in the
institutions and culture of East Germany itself.
   ``... A unified Germany in defense alliances will continue to
look West, it will continue to be allied with the forces of freedom
and democracy, which is the West,'' Quayle said.
   At the same time he cautioned against unilateral reductions in
U.S. troop strength in Europe, saying that precipitous cuts could
damage both Western security and the movement toward freedom in the
East.
   Quayle was the keynote speaker as the Republican governors
opened a day and a half of conferences on politics, issues and
problems of state government.
   Fifteen of the 22 GOP state governors were on hand at the first
major party gathering since the Nov. 7 elections in which Virginia
and New Jersey elected Democratic governors.
   But association leaders said the outcome was no surprise.
   The New Jersey defeat will thin the ranks of the GOP governors
to 21. Virginia will remain Democratic unless a recount overturns
the closest gubernatorial election in state history.
   Gov. Mike Hayden of Kansas, chairman of the Republican
governors, said Sunday night that last week's balloting confirmed
what the party already knew: There is a big job ahead if the GOP is
going to elect more governors next year.
   He told a news conference it is vital that Republicans
aggressively recruit the best candidates available. Asked whether
that meant that the GOP candidates this year _ James Courter in New
Jersey and J. Marshall Coleman in Virginia _ were not the strongest
of entries, he replied: ``Well, they didn't win.''
   One issue that hurt them was abortion, which both men opposed
but on which both tempered their positions during the campaign.
Hayden and his colleagues said Republicans could defuse that issue
by handling it head-on in 1990.
   Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina said Republican
candidates should spell out clear positions on the abortion issue
and avoid being typecast simply as pro-life or anti-abortion
politicians.
   Campbell is opposed to abortion except in cases of rape, incest
or threat to the life of the mother, but he bristled at a question
describing him as a ``pro-life'' Republican, calling it an
oversimplification.
   Campbell said Republicans running in 1989 allowed themselves to
be cornered on the issue, while Democrats were able to define their
own views and the positions of their GOP rivals as well.
   ``You'll beat nothing with something every time you put it on
the table,'' he said.
   Quayle joined the governors in a golf tournament Sunday _ his
team finished second.
   He and Lee Atwater, the Republican national chairman, were
delivering the administration's political message to the governors,
looking toward a 1990 campaign in which 36 states will elect
governors, 34 will choose senators and all 435 House seats will be
at stake.
   Atwater was concentrating on the politics of reapportionment.
Governors and legislatures chosen in 1990 will have a major hand in
reapportioning House seats after next year's Census. The party that
controls state government controls the crucial redistricting
process.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and William Bennett, director
of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, also are addressing
the governors.

   Police say no arrests have been made in the
shootings of a pregnant woman and her husband, whose car phone led
police to the couple, but published reports say a key suspect in
the case is in custody for other crimes.
   William Bennett, 39, of Boston's Mission Hill section, where
Carol and Charles Stuart were abducted and shot last month, has
been identified by police sources as a suspect in that shooting,
newspapers said.
   Mrs. Stuart and her infant son, delivered prematurely by
Caesarian section, both died. Stuart remains hospitalized.
   Bennett was arrested Saturday on a traffic violation and
appeared in court in Charlestown and Brookline today.
   The Charlestown case was postponed and Bennett then was taken to
Brookline, where he is a suspect in a video store holdup. At the
Brookline arraignment he pleaded innocent and was held in lieu of
$350,000 bond.
   Joel Goodman, Bennett's attorney in the Brookline case, said
``not a word has been said to me by the police or district
attorney's office as to whether my client is a suspect in the
Stuart shooting.''
   Judith Lindahl, who represented Bennett on the Charlestown
traffic charge, declined to comment when asked if her client were a
suspect in the Stuart shooting.
   ``There is sufficient publicity in the case to deny my client a
fair trial,'' she said.
   The Boston Sunday Globe said both Stuart and the victims at the
video store told police the gunman had a distinctive raspy voice
and a scruffy, spotty beard, and gave similar discriptions of the
handgun he used.
   Police spokesman Jim Jordan said it was department policy not to
comment on suspects until someone is charged.
   The Boston Sunday Herald cited unidentified police sources as
saying Bennett was a chief suspect in the Stuarts' shooting.
   Joseph Dunford, deputy chief of detectives for Boston Police,
said Sunday he had no comment on the Herald article.
   Pauline Bennett, the man's mother, said her son was a suspect in
the Stuarts' shooting, the Herald said.
   ``They say he's a suspect. He's been in trouble before. He knew
he was a suspect. He was nervous and upset about it,'' Ms. Bennett
said.
   Bennett's girlfriend, Faye Nelson, of Burlington, told the Sun
of Lowell in a telephone interview that he didn't attack the
Stuarts. ``He was here when everything occurred,'' she said.
   The Stuarts were abducted just as they were leaving Brigham and
Womens' Hospital, where they had attended a birthing class, and
forced to drive to a street where they were robbed and shot. Stuart
called police on his car's cellular phone, and when he lost
consciousness emergency operators located him by listening for
police car sirens heard over the phone.
   Stuart, 29, was listed in stable condition in intensive care
after surgery Saturday at Boston City Hospital; hospital officials
would not give a reason for the surgery.

<HEAD>More Than 200 Japanese Art Objects Stolen From Haifa Museum</HEAD>

   More than 200 Japanese miniature art objects
valued at $300,000 were stolen before dawn Monday from the Japanese
Art Museum in Haifa, the museum's director said.
   David Plonsky, head of museum administration in Haifa, offered a
$5,000 reward for information leading to recovery of stolen objects.
   Japanese Art Museum director Elie Lanzman said the 203 stolen
pieces included small sculptures called netsuke, lacquered boxes,
writing utensils and examples of metal work.
   The art of netsuke reached its height in Japan in the 17th to
19th centuries, and these tiny sculptures in the form of ornamental
buttons contain some of the best examples of Japanese carving.
   The radio said that the museum in Haifa, a northern port city,
had guards but no alarm system, and the thieves apparently entered
through an opening that was left unlocked.
   The stolen art works were among some 300 objects displayed at
the museum's exhibition of Japanese miniature art, it said.

<HEAD>Relief, Pride as Germans Sense an End to Cold War Division</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Germans, this is a time of
happiness, relief and even national pride after four decades of
living with the Cold War division of the two countries.
   The opening of East Germany's borders and the crumbling of the
Berlin Wall at times seemed impossible, but then happened overnight.
   ``This is our Germany, our country!'' said an exuberant Lutz
Hermann of East Berlin as he joined hundreds of thousands of others
in passing freely through the wall to the West.
   Germans long have been engulfed by the Cold War, a product of
Adolf Hitler's murderous Nazi legacy.
   The wall in Berlin, the Communist border fortifications, the
East Germans gunned down trying to escape to the West formed a part
of daily life.
   Now, with the wall a relic of the past and borders between the
countries open, Germans who embraced each with tears of joy sense
that an end to the Cold War division may be within reach.
   ``In recent days, as the world looks upon Berlin and Germany, no
one needs to be ashamed of his tears,'' said the conservative
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper in a front-page editorial
Sunday.
   The newspaper, in a special edition marking East Germany's new
border policy, added: ``They (the Germans) have had to live long
enough with a border that has ripped apart villages and families.''
   Even West Germany's leftist politicians, long skeptical of
demands for German reunification, in recent days have become fond
of quoting the national anthem's call for ``unity'' as well as
justice and freedom for the German nation.
   In East Berlin, the euphoric reaction has come from the people
rather than from the government, which remains fiercely opposed to
any trends toward reunification.
   Millions of ordinary East Germans poured into the West over the
weekend, in the largest East-West party in history.
   Yet, the happiness, relief and pride still leave many issues
open.
   In East Germany, the government still must figure out which way
to turn, now that it has raised the people's hopes to a fever pitch.
   Giving people the freedom to travel won't solve the massive
problems caused by the exodus of tens of thousands, nor will it
solve such tricky questions as whether East Berlin will allow truly
free elections.
   In West Germany, national pride itself remains a sensitive
issue, as right-wing extremists preach a message of being ``proud
to be German'' and make startling political gains.
   Bonn also also faces enormous difficulties, now that West
Germany has taken on the burden of absorbing so many East German
refugees.
   The question is whether Bonn, after years of urging open
borders, will erect its own restrictions to keep out East Germans
by means of a kind of invisible wall.
   Both countries remain at the front lines of officially hostile
military alliances, with 250,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in West
Germany and nearly 400,000 Soviet troops in East Germany.
   The Nazi legacy itself will still be an issue for Germans,
despite the growing complaint from conservative historians that it
is a ``past that will not go into the past.''
   Newspaper editorials, leading intellectuals and politicians on
Sunday all expressed ambivalent feelings, welcoming the East
Germans' new freedom but questioning the dangers posed by a united
Germany.

   Dot Harkness banked on her pension plan,
borrowed money against it and planned to do some traveling with her
ailing husband in the Utah hills when she retired. Then she found
out the savings she counted on had vanished in a bad investment.
   James Carsten worked for a jewelry repair shop for 30 years and
figured he'd be due about $19,000 in pension benefits. Instead,
``all the money disappeared,'' he said.
   Mrs. Harkness and Carsten were victimized by plans that weren't
insured by the federal government's Pension Benefits Guaranty
Corporation. According to government figures, only 40 million of
the 76 million workers with private pension plans are eligible for
that protection.
   By law, pension fund managers are prohibited from putting all
the money into a single investment. They also are required to
ensure that any risks are reasonable.
   But small programs _ those with 25 or fewer participants _ don't
qualify for federal insurance, and even the larger programs can be
undermined by bad investments or outright theft.
   The ``little guys'' have an especially hard time making their
cases if their funds are abused, says the Labor Department's acting
inspector general, Raymond Maria.
   ``People are sort of desperate,'' says Karen Ferguson, director
of the Pension Rights Center, a public interest group. ``There's no
one to help them. If the people who are running the plan are
bankrupt, there's nothing to do. And there are a lot of them out
there.''
   The Labor Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits
Adminstration is charged with investigating abuses. But Mrs.
Harkness and Carsten said they received no satisfaction from the
government.
   Mrs. Harkness, 63, worked as a receptionist for a doctor,
handling his billing, setting up appointments and answering the
phones. The practice was sold in 1978 but she stayed on and figured
her nest egg was safe.
   ``I was fully vested, so I didn't worry,'' Mrs. Harkness said in
a telephone interview from her Park City, Utah, home.
   In 1983, she took out an $8,500 loan against her pension to buy
a 1978 motor home and began paying back $200 a month, including 14
percent interest, into the account. She figured she had about
$20,000 in the pension fund.
   In 1987 she said she received a call shortly before midnight
from the doctor for whom she was first employed, saying: ``We had
lost all our money. The account had gone down the tubes.''
   After failing to get help from the Labor Department, Mrs.
Harkness notified the Pension Rights Center, which referred her to
an attorney and the case rests with the courts.
   ``We were very conservative and raised three children,'' Mrs.
Harkness said. ``I counted on this money.''
   While Mrs. Harkness sounds distraught, Carsten is angry.
   ``I've spent three years trying to get my money and I've just
wasted my time,'' he said in a telephone interview from his
Seattle, Wash., home.
   The company he worked for was sold and the investment group
administering the plan went bankrupt after reportedly investing in
palm trees.
   Carsten went to the Labor Department and wrote letters to his
congressmen.
   But the sheer size of the nation's private pension system works
against individuals such as Carsten and Mrs. Harkness. With just
300 inspectors, the government can check only a tiny percentage of
the country's 870,000 such programs. Enforcement actions, by and
large, have focused on the bigger offenders.
   Carsten, meanwhile, says he can't afford an attorney to pursue
his case on his own. ``That's all I have for retirement,'' he said.

   International mail ``has no frontiers,'' K.R.
Murthy of India declared Monday as he opened the 20th congress of
the Universal Postal Union.
   President Bush, welcoming delegates from nearly 170 nations to
the session, said that the worldwide mail system remains essential
despite the growth in electronic communications.
   ``The need to communicate by mail across national frontiers _
despite the march of time and the advent of telecommunications _
has remained constant,'' Bush told the formal opening session of
the congress.
   ``Only the postal system can reach and serve every man, woman
and child on this planet every day and do so at a price that is in
their reach,'' said U.S. Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank.
   The delegates will wrestle with international mail agreements
and disputes for the next five weeks in a meeting held only every
five years. This is the first time since 1897 that the congress has
been held in the United States.
   If the international postal system is to prosper, there is a
compelling need for the progress of all members, said Murthy, dean
of the meeting and former director general of the Indian Postal
Service.
   Representatives come from nations with different goals and
needs, Murthy observed, with some nations needing to employ more
technological advances and others needing to update antiquated
systems.
   As ``we approach the turn of the century, we suddenly find many
rural communities and hitherto predominately agricultural nations
newly involved in industry, trade and commerce in ever-increasing
measure,'' said Murthy.
   ``Postal administrations, in developed as well as developing
countries, now face a wider variety of demands from an enthusiastic
and exacting cleintele,'' he said.
   Complex technical questions are expected to dominate the
gathering, with one major focus on international payment for mail
delivery.
   Under current rules, the weight of mail shipped between nations
is compared annually and the nation sending more out pays the
countries receiving it for their delivery services. Proposals for
some changes in that system are being considered, including the
possibility of measuring the number of items exchanged rather than
merely the weight of the mail shipped.
   Decisions are made by consensus at the gathering, with each
nation having one vote.
   The Universal Postal Union was formed in the mid-1800s in an
effort to solve the confusing system in which each nation had to
have separate agreements with other nations to exchange mail.

   The Bush administration said today the
U.S.-backed El Salvador government has not asked for help in
combating a guerrilla offensive that left at least 139 people dead
and prompted President Alfredo Cristiani to declare a state of
siege.
   ``It's our belief that they (the government) are in control of
the situation at this point,'' White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   Asked if he would rule out any U.S. involvement in the fighting,
Fitzwater said, ``we can never predict the future but at this
point, it's not anticipated.''
   Fifty-five U.S. military trainers are stationed in El Salvador
but are not supposed to accompany the Salvadoran armed forces on
military missions. Fitzwater said there was no change in the status
of the U.S. serivcemen.
   ial buildings Saturday night and occupied
several sectors of the northern part of San Salvador.
   Cheney, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said, ``We've
got, of course, advisers in El Salvador, but I think the government
of El Salvador can handle it.''
   ``I think there's a bit of a view that the attack on the city
basically is a move of desperation by the guerrillas, that the FMLN
(Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front) ... is under a lot of
pressure from the Salvadoran government and that this is an effort
to try to dramatize their posture,'' Cheney said.
   Baker, interviewed on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''
said that ``as far as we know this morning, the American community
is accounted for _ that is, the Americans residents in El Salvador
and the diplomats and military people that we have there.''
   ``I can tell you that I believe there has been one American
casualty, a schoolteacher, killed. There are no other American
casualties, as far as I know,'' he said. He did not identify the
teacher.
   ``This appears to be an action that the insurgency in El
Salvador, the FMLN, has undertaken _ a rather desperate action, in
my view _ to disrupt the negotiations that they were having with
the government toward seeking a political accommodation.''
   Baker said he didn't believe the offensive would destabilize the
Salvadoran government.
   ``I think the government of El Salvador can handle this,
militarily and defensively,'' he said.
   The attacks came three days after the FMLN promised to intensify
its insurgency against the government. More than 70,000 people have
been killed in the guerrilla war.

   For East Berliner Peter Normann, Monday was a
return to reality after a heady weekend of freedom celebrations.
   ``Now things must go back to normal,'' the 32-year-old
construction worker said as he took a cigarette break on the site
of a new office complex and glanced at the Berlin Wall less than
100 yards away.
   Other East Berliners braving the gray morning chill on their way
to the office, work bench or factory floor shared Normann's view
that the party was over.
   In all, more than 3 million East Germans headed west during the
weekend, and officials said 99 percent of them then returned home.
   The euphoria of the weekend _ many young East Berliners had
never been to the West until then _ was tinged with worry for some.
Money and the East German economy were among common concerns.
   ``I really don't know whether I should be happy or pensive,''
said Michael Werner, gunning his massive Volga taxi through a
yellow light shortly after picking up a Western visitor on a
near-deserted main thoroughfare.
   Most streets appeared normally quiet, but there was lively
traffic going both ways at the Checkpoint Charlie crossing point.
Werner pointed to long lines at several banks and police precinct
stations as evidence that things were not the same.
   People were filling out forms for visas to go west or queuing to
buy the annual allotment of 15 West German marks allowed them by
the state for visits to West Berlin.
   Werner was born Sept. 21, 1961 _ a little more than a month
after East German military and paramilitary units began work on the
wall. He crossed over to West Berlin for the first time early
Friday, just hours after the Communist East Berlin government eased
travel restrictions.
   After queuing in West Berlin for more than an hour, he was given
100 West German marks ($54) in ``welcome money.'' That was a small
treasure compared with the annual entitlement allowed by his
government, but Werner didn't spend a pfennig.
   ``I didn't know what to do,'' he confided sheepishly. ``Things
cost so much over there, and then there are differences in prices
depending on which store you go to. It's not like over here.''
   Money for the West also was carpenter Dieter Voelcov's worry, as
he finished a hearty breakfast of Bauernschmaus _ an omelette with
diced ham and potatoes _ at the Nordring Bier Bar in the heart of
the city.
   While the East German mark is not freely convertible, many West
Berlin stores accepted them over the weekend. But their rate of one
West mark to 10 East marks irritated some East Berliners.
   ``What am I going to do with 100 West marks a year, if I can go
over as often as I want,'' he groused, wiping beer foam off his
mustache. ``The freedom to travel is our main theme at work, but we
always come back to the same thing, where to get hard currency.''
   Co-worker Dieter Boy agreed, suggesting that East Germany was at
the mercy of the economic powerhouse of the West _ one of the
excuses offered by the Communists for building the wall in the
first place.
   ``If this continues, the West is going to buy us out!''
exclaimed Boy, a stocky 28-year-old. ``We're either all going to
end up working over there, or we'll spend anything we make here on
the other side of the wall.''
   The everyday frustrations of Monday in East Berlin came home to
a man in line for oranges _ brought in once a year from Spain in
time for Christmas _ who was told the oranges had run out.
   ``This is what socialism looks like!'' he exclaimed bitterly to
those standing behind him. ``We still have a long way to go,
despite the weekend.''

   Lebanon's new president designated
veteran Moslem politician Salim Hoss as prime minister Monday and
Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian army commander, rejected the choice.
   Hoss and Aoun have led rival Moslem and Christian governments
since the six-year term of President Amin Gemayel ended in
September 1988 with Parliament unable to agree on a successor.
   Aoun issued a statement Monday saying the Hoss nomination was
``as unconstitutional as the election'' Nov. 5 of President Rene
Mouawad.
   The session at which Parliament elected Mouawad and endorsed a
peace plan was held in Syrian-controlled north Lebanon because Aoun
threatened to shell the parliament building in Beirut.
   Mouawad, a Christian, instructed Hoss to form a national
reconciliation government with the mission of ending the
14-year-old sectarian civil war, in which more than 150,000 people
have been killed.
   Police reported exchanges of artillery and small-arms fire
across Beirut's sectarian dividing line between Aoun's Christian
army units and Moslem militias backed by Syria. Each side accused
the other of starting the battle and no casualty reports were
available.
   A six-month artillery war between Aoun's men and a Moslem
alliance led by the Syrians killed at least 930 people and wounded
2,744 before a truce arranged by the Arab League ended it in
September.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, the year after the war began.
Aoun calls the Syrians an occupation force and has declared a ``war
of liberation'' to drive them out.
   Later Monday, Aoun said: ``This will be an unconstitutional
government. It will not be a national reconciliation government; it
will represent one side. ``Even if the whole world recognizes it,
Hoss' government will be a government operating in the shadow of
Syrian occupation. Governments cannot survive only on foreign
recognition.''
   Aoun spoke to The Associated Press in his bunker beneath the
shattered presidential palace in Baabda, east of Beirut, which he
has refused to leave since Mouawad's election.
   Mouawad, 64, designated Hoss, 59, a Sunni Moslem, after three
days of consultations with political leaders.
   Hoss accepted the job for the third time in 13 years and said
the 55th government since independence from France in 1943 would
implement the peace accord worked out in Taif, Saudia Arabia, which
includes a plan for sharing power between Christians and Moslems.
   Christians were the majority in 1943 and have controlled the
government, army and judiciary, but Moslems now account for about
55 percent of the population and have demanded an equal role in
running the country.
   Mouawad, Hoss and Hussein Husseini, the Shiite Moslem who is
speaker of Parliament, received about 50 foreign ambassadors at the
president's temporary headquarters _ the prime minister's office in
Moslem west Beirut.
   ``I call upon all of you to join our march toward peace,''
Mouawad said in a seven-minute address. ``We consider the Taif
accord an introduction to peace and a launching pad for a new
republic based on equality among all Lebanese.
   ``I pledge to whole world to consolidate the unity and
sovereignty of Lebanon and to rebuild its constitutional
institutions.''
   The United States was not represented at the meeting, which
underscored international recognition of Mouawad, because its
embassy was closed Sept. 6 after Aoun supporters put it under siege.
   Iran boycotted the meeting. The Iranians and the Hezbollah
militia, their main ally in Lebanon, have rejected the Taif accord
because it does not give the major say in government to the 1.2
million Shiites, the largest sect in Lebanon.
   Hoss first became prime minister under the late President Elias
Sarkis, soon after the Syrian army intervention in 1976. He
returned to the post when Prime Minister Rashid Karami was
assassinated in June 1, 1987.

<HEAD>Eds: Top 15 grafs new with White House, Quayle comments tdoay; picks

<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The White House today hailed the ``glorious''
sight of people exercising new freedoms in East Germany, but said
``we can understand and even expect'' that most East Germans will
stay and help rebuild their country rather than flee.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also virtually ruled out any
possibility that President Bush will add a stopover in Berlin to
next month's shipboard meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in the Mediterreanean off Malta.
   The White House has emphasized the informality of that meeting.
Fitzwater said today the leaders will use it ``to give a push to
all the talks'' on both nuclear and conventional arms control.
   However, ``we do not intend to have this emerge as a second
Yalta,'' he said, referring to the 1945 meeting where Franklin
Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin met to carve up the
boundaries of post-war Europe.
   On the dramatic events in East Germany, Fitzwater said, ``One of
the most glorious aspects of this weekend's activities was seeing
so many people not only discover but exercise those freedoms for
the first time.''
   But when asked by reporters what advice Bush would give the
masses of East Germans who eventually returned to their side of the
border, the spokesman replied:
   ``We won't encourage them one way or another, except as the
president did last Friday and say in these times of dramatically
changing reform, events are so exciting and so many possibilities
on the horizon, we can certainly understand and even expect that
most East Germans would want to be a part of this change.''
   Meanwhile today, Vice President Dan Quayle told a gathering of
Republican governors on Hilton Head Island, S.C., that the eventual
reunification of Germany is inevitable and that when it comes, the
rejoined nation will be ``allied with the forces of freedom and
democracy, which is the West.''
   Quayle disputed complaints by Democrats that Bush has been timid
in dealing with change at home and abroad, contending that all they
want to do is spend more money.
   ``The Democrats haven't offered one creative idea on how to
manage the evolving situation in Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union
except to criticize the president,'' Quayle said in an interview
after his speech. He said the administration has been properly
cautious but still ``out front on this issue.''
   On the Dec. 2-3 meeting with Gorbachev, Fitzwater said, ``We do
not intend to have this emerge as a second Yalta. And we do not
intend to engage in the kinds of decision-making that would lead
you to that kind of conclusion.''
   But he added, ``I think they want to give a push to all the
talks. ... You're going to see them emerge and urge progress on CFE
(conventional forces in Europe) and START (strategic arms
reduction) and all the arms control talks.''
   ``It clearly is an effort to provide progress in these areas.
But that's far different than negotiating specific points,''
Fitzwater said.
   Asked about the possibility that Bush would visit Berlin, the
spokesman said, ``We can't foresee any set of circumstances at this
moment that would induce him to go.''
   He said the president is still weighing a reply to a message
Gorbachev sent Friday backing the changes made by East Germany's
new leaders and expressing hope that the situation will remain
peaceful.
   Tonight, Bush will present Lech Walesa with the Presidential
Medal of Freedom in a White House ceremony. Walesa is the
Solidarity leader whose labor movement propelled Poland into the
vanguard of the shift toward democracy in the communist East Bloc.
   On Sunday, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov
said of Bush's response to the joyous tumult in East Berlin: ``I
think he's handling it as a real statesman.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III emphasized that the
administration wants ``to encourage this move toward openness in
Eastern Europe,'' but ``to do so in a way that doesn't seek
unilateral advantage and ... doesn't promote instability.''
   Gerasimov, interviewed on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,''
predicted that Bush and Gorbachev, at their Dec. 2-3 shipboard
summit off Malta, ``may come to a common ground ... that both
countries _ and actually everybody _ is interested in stability, in
not too much upheaval in Europe.''
   Baker, on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley,'' called the
opening of East Germany's borders ``historic,'' but said, ``it
doesn't mean a whole lot in economic terms.''
   For the United States to consider coming to the economic aid of
East Germany, Baker said, it first must be convinced the rulers of
the once hard-line communist state are moving toward a free-market
system.
   ``It would be wrong to have a different standard for East
Germany than we do for Poland and Hungary,'' Baker said. ``We are
somewhat constrained in what we can do before there is clear
evidence that they want to reform their economic system.''
   Baker said he believes Moscow would draw the line at any attempt
by its East Bloc allies to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact, the
communist alliance's counterpart to the West's North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   But, Baker said, ``they have made it very clear to us ... that
they will not use force in Eastern Europe.''
   Baker said the United States would welcome the eventual
reunification of the two Germanies ``as long as that reunification
comes about on the basis of Western values.'' But he stressed it is
too soon ``to make the great leap ... from right of free travel on
the part of East Germans to the question of reunification.''

<HEAD>Trial of Four Activists in Bratislava Opened</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four prominent human rights
activists went on trial Monday in Bratislava on charges of sedition
for urging Slovaks to lay flowers in memory of those killed in the
1968 Warsaw Pact invasion.
   Miroslav Kusy, Hana Ponicka, Anton Selecky and Vladimir Manak
were charged with sedition in August together with fellow human
rights activist Jan Carnogursky. The face as many as five years in
jail.
   The five signed a statement urging Slovaks to mark the 21st
anniversary of the Soviet-led Aug. 21, 1968 invasion, which crushed
Communist reform in Czechoslovakia.
   Kusy, a former Communist Party Central Committee secretary
during the 1968 Prague Spring reform period who was later expelled
from the party, also is charged with subversion.
   Carnogursky, who also faces sedition and subversion charges,
went on trial Nov. 6, but the proceedings were adjourned because
his defense lawyer suffered a circulatory collapse and could not
attend. No date was set for a new trial.
   Emigre sources in Vienna said that the defense on Monday asked
that the four be tried together with Carnogursky. The official CTK
news agency said the court heard the defendants but then adjourned
the proceedings until Tuesday.
   The trials epitomize a crackdown on dissent in Czechoslovakia,
whose hard-line Communist leaders have refused to follow the reform
path taken by other Warsaw Pact countries. Most Czechoslovak
leaders were installed after the 1968 invasion.
   In Poland, Hungary, the Soviet Union and now in East Germany,
Communists have either agreed to share power or at least permitted
opposition groups to publicize their opinions and hold large
demonstrations.
   Czechoslovakia has taken one of the hardest lines against
dissent. Last month, baton-wielding police in Prague dispersed up
to 10,000 demonstrators who called for freedom and a new government.
   Still, active opposition is growing slowly. The activists'
trials in Bratislava have sparked considerable protest even from
some establishment intellectuals and last week about 200 people
demonstrated outside Bratislava's Palace of Justice to demand
Carnogursky's release. They also chanted calls for freedom and
human rights.

<HEAD>House Approves Chemical Weapons Sanctions Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Monday approved a bill requiring
trade sanctions against any country that uses chemical or
biological weapons in violation of international law.
   The measure, similar to a bill pending before the Senate, would
require the president to choose from a variety of penalties if he
determines that a country has used such weapons, such as in Iraq's
actions during the Persian Gulf war and against its own Kurdish
minority.
   Possible actions include prohibition of U.S. arms sales to the
offending nation, export of goods and technology which could be
used to make chemical weapons, restriction of imports from the
country, a cutoff of any foreign aid, opposition to loans from
multilateral banks and suspension of diplomatic relations.
   Proponents said they recognize that U.S. sanctions alone would
be relatively ineffective because arms and chemicals are available
from other sources, and the bill urges the administration to
encourage other countries to join in any sanctions it imposes.
   The measure allows the president to waive the sanctions if they
would not be in the national security interests of the United
States.

   The Customs Service should not buy any more
frontline radar planes for detecting drug-ferrying aircraft until
electronics problems are resolved, the chairman of a Senate
appropriations panel said Monday.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, chairman of the Appropriations
subcommittee that funded the purchase of P-3 airborne early warning
aircraft, said Customs must get the two planes already in service
operating fully by March or refuse delivery of a third plane in
April.
   ``If they don't fix it, I'm going to come down on them hard,''
said DeConcini, D-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government.
   DeConcini said Customs Service aircrews have told him that
problems in tracking and locating suspect planes are not being
addressed. ``What we may have is a breakdown where supervisors have
not responded to these complaints,'' he said in an interview.
   ``If they don't adhere to the suggestion (to fix the problems or
postpone delivery), I'll have a hearing and it won't be pleasant.
I'm very interested, being the chairman of the funding committee,
in not letting a new contract when we don't have one that works.''
   Customs Service documents show that the planes have been plagued
by an unreliable computer system that has trouble pinpointing the
location of targets and following their course and speed; faulty
on-board communications for the crew, and problems with a spinning,
metal radar dome. Most documents were written by crewmen at
Customs' Surveillance Support Center in Corpus Christi, Texas,
where the radar planes are based.
   The acting director of the Customs Service surveillance center,
Peter Kendig, has acknowledged there are a ``few glitches'' in the
computer systems, but said the P-3 aircraft ``works and it works
great.'' He said the two planes now flying were mainly responsible
for detections leading to 36 arrests from Jan. 1 to Aug. 10 this
year, seizures of 37,000 pounds of marijuana and 8,300 pounds of
cocaine as well as vessels, aircraft and vehicles.
   The Lockheed P-3 is a four-engine turboprop that was built for
detecting enemy submarines, but two of them were outfitted with the
most sophisticated electronics available and sold to the Customs
Service to detect airborne drug smugglers. Lockheed hopes to sell
the P-3 as a surveillance plane to other countries for military
use, as a competitor to existing detection aircraft.
   The first P-3 airborne early warning aircraft was delivered in
June 1988 at a cost of more than $27 million, and the second
arrived last April at a price of $30.6 million. The third plane is
scheduled to be delivered to the Customs Service next April at a
cost of $35 million, money already appropriated by Congress.
   The major electronics problem documented in Customs memos _ and
in interviews with Customs Service sources and Lockheed officials _
is the computerized tracker. The equipment is designed to
automatically plot the course and speed of a suspect aircraft, but
it is sometimes so inaccurate that the P-3 cannot reliably guide
interceptors to the suspected smugglers, according to Customs
service memos and interviews with agency sources.
   Lockheed's airborne early warning program manager, John
McGinnis, has said in interviews he hopes ``anomalous behavior'' in
the tracker will be fixed by ``the first of the year.'' He
contended that despite the discrepancies, ``The airplane and the
tracker are very capable and doing their job.''
   Meanwhile, Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., who has guided the P-3
program through the House, said the House Government Operations
Committee on which he serves will ask the General Accounting Office
to investigate the program. He also has asked Chairman John
Conyers, D-Mich., to schedule hearings.

   The new traffic light is unpopular
and the occasional aftershocks are unsettling, but residents of
this old logging town say they're coping with the changes wrought
by the Oct. 17 earthquake.
   They admit to being nervous, though.
   ``Any sudden noise will do it. I have one foot inside and one
foot outside the door,'' said Randy Vanderstelt, one of 6,000
residents of Boulder Creek, which is nestled in the Santa Cruz
Mountains near the epicenter of the quake.
   Although Boulder Creek, 12 miles northeast of Santa Cruz, is
primarily a commuter town, not all traces of its logging heritage
have been swept aside. A streak of stubborn independence still
lingers amid the redwood storefronts bearing names such as ``The
Rex Hotel'' or ``The Brandy Bakery.''
   That tradition of independence is one reason some quake victims
only now are seeking help, said Steve Taylor, owner of The
Groundskeeper coffee shop.
   ``Some just now are coming out of the mountains for
assistance,'' Taylor said. ``They felt they could do it themselves.
It's part of what they're here for. They just realized they need
help.''
   Talking and sharing experiences has helped ease worries and
trauma, he said.
   One hot topic of conversation is the new downtown traffic light
_ the town's first. The state Department of Transportation
installed it on Highway 9, the two-lane road that cuts through the
center of town and has become the best route between Santa Cruz and
San Jose while repairs are made to four-lane Highway 17.
   The light has not exactly been hailed as progress.
   ``Everybody wants to tear it down,'' Vanderstelt said. Noting
that nine cars were waiting for the light to change, he added,
``This is what I consider a traffic jam.''
   Homes in Boulder Creek often reflect the area's relative
isolation, with wood-fired stoves and propane tanks and wells.
   In some cases, the quake dirtied wells or dried them up. In
others, it forced new springs to spout from the sandstone topsoil.
In still others, it rocked houses off their foundations.
   On Rebecca Street, high above the town, a string of five
adjacent houses either collapsed or slid precariously toward a
steep slope. Neighbors said they hadn't heard from the families who
lived in them.
   ``Anybody who's going to leave already has left,'' said Hank
Zumbahlen, who lives across the street. ``Everybody else has come
out of the woodwork, offering help or keeping notes on who's going
and who's staying.''
   His wife, Cathy, said their children have a new game.
   ``Now the kids play earthquake. Our two-year-old runs around the
house, yelling, `Aftershock! Aftershock!,''' she said.
   Santa Cruz County geologists say the temblor loosened hundreds
of acres of topsoil along the San Andreas fault that lines the
mountain ridge. They warned that winter's first major rainfall
could send houses crashing down the steep canyons that slice the
area.
   Homeowners were told the county would not issue permits to
rebuild or repair structures where earthquake fissures exist until
geological studies are completed. They fear they cannot wait that
long.
   Residents voted to find a geologist, a soil engineer and an
attorney to deal with the county. Talks with county officials have
begun to explore the possibility of allowing residents the
opportunity to proceed with repairs at their own risk.
   ``This has become the center of the geologic world,'' said
resident Doug Henderson. ``Geologists from across the states, even
Japan, have been scrambling around here.
   ``I guess it would be better for them if there is a mudslide,''
he said. ``But if it looks like something's going to happen, I'll
take my family and head for a hotel somewhere.''

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities shot and killed the
captured leader of the Sinhalese anti-government uprising Monday,
the foreign minister said, despite previously guaranteeing his
safety.
   Government security officers killed Rohana Wijeweera, founder
and leader of the Sinhalese extremist People's Liberation Front, at
his group's Colombo headquarters, Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne
said.
   Wijeweera had led soldiers to the headquarters where another
member of the front fired a revolver at him, Wijeratne said. The
soldiers opened fire, killing Wijeweera and the other member, H.B.
Herath.
   A political leader considered sympathetic to the People's
Liberation Front warned that Wijeweera's death would lead to more
violence.
   ``The killing, if it is true, will certainly escalate violence
in the country because you can kill a man but not an ideology,''
said Samuel Dias Bandaranaike, leader of the Sri Lanka Progressive
Front.
   ``The people will not believe the government's version of the
killing of Wijeweera,'' he said. ``The killing took place after
President (Ranasinghe) Premadasa repeatedly guaranteed his personal
safety.''
   Premadasa has made repeated overtures to Wijeweera and the front
to cease violence and open talks with the government, but the
offers have been rejected.
   Wijeweera and Herath were cremated under emergency regulations
that allow security forces to dispose of bodies without a post
mortem, said Wijeratne, who is also the deputy defense minister.
Premadasa has ordered an inquiry into the shooting, he said.
   Authorities captured Wijeweera along with his wife and five
children Sunday in the central district of Kandy, Wijeratne said.
He was brought to Colombo where he cooperated with interrogators
and voluntarily videotaped a speech appealing for peace, Wijeratne
said.
   The People's Liberation Front has been waging a campaign of
terror and assassination since 1987 in its bid to overthrow the
Sinhalese-dominated government. The violence has escalated in
recent months with hundreds of suspected members of the group
killed by pro-government vigilante groups in revenge attacks.
   The government says 6,000 people have been killed in the
confrontation.
   The People's Liberation Front has attacked the government
because it claims too many concessions had been given to the Tamil
minority in an effort to halt a separatist insurrection in the
Tamil-dominated northeast.
   Sinhalese form 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
control the government and the military. Tamils, who make up 18
percent of the population, have been fighting for an independent
nation since 1983, complaining of discrimination in jobs and
education by the Sinhalese. The Tamil separatist war has claimed at
least 11,000 lives.

   Parliament chose a leading reformer as premier
today, and more than 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig to
demand free elections from a government that already has been
pressured into granting them free travel.
   Parliament also for the first time elected a non-communist as
its speaker.
   The demonstrators, gathered in the city that has become the
focus for protests against the East German leadership, demanded the
Communist Party abolish its monopoly on power.
   West German television newscasts estimated the number of
protesters at between 200,000 and 300,000.
   The protest came after a weekend in which East Germans by the
millions exercised their new freedom to travel, a right granted by
the government to counter an exodus of emigres to the West.
   East Berliners today began returning to their jobs after four
days of frenzied celebrations at the newly opened Berlin Wall, and
officials said fewer than 1 percent of those who crossed into the
West during the weekend chose to stay in West Germany.
   About 100,000 East German visitors still headed West today, West
German authorities said. The flow of visitors was far slower than
during the weekend, when more than 3 million people made the trip.
   In East Berlin, the Parliament convened and elected Hans Modrow,
a leading reformer, to be the new premier. He would replace Willi
Stoph, who resigned along with his 44-member Cabinet on Tuesday.
   Modrow is a well known reformer within the party, which has been
headed by Egon Krenz since Oct. 18. Krenz himself has promised some
reforms, including free elections.
   Earlier, Parliament elected a non-communist, Guenther Maleuda,
as its new speaker in an unprecedented secret ballot. The ruling
Communist Party did not propose a candidate for the post.
   Maleuda, 58, is the chairman of the Democratic Peasants party,
one of the four small parties that have been allied with the
Communists for 40 years. During the political turmoil in recent
weeks, the four parties have been cautiously exploring ways of
becoming more independent.
   Also today, the party's 163-member Central Committee set Dec. 15
for an emergency party congress, which would have the power to
elect an entire new Central Committee and change party politics.
   Maleuda was elected to replace Horst Sindermann, a Communist
party official who was sacked from the ruling Politburo last week
and today resigned from his post of Parliament president.
   Maleuda surprisingly defeated Manfred Gerlach, chairman of the
Liberal Democratic party who was one of the first politicians to
call for broad political and economic reforms.
   No candidate won a majority on the first ballot. In a run-off
against Gerlach, Maleuda received 246 votes, while Gerlach got 230.
The parliament has 500 members, but only 477 attended the session
and one abstained.
   Meanwhile, Francois Mitterrand invited the leaders of the
European Community countries to a special meeting Saturday in Paris
to discuss the rapidly changing situation in Europe, the
presidential palace announced today in Paris.
   West Berlin began cleaning up the remnants of a celebration that
began Thursday, with the opening of East Germany's borders, and
finally began winding down Sunday night.
   Federal government officials in Bonn said fewer than 1 percent
of the estimated 3 million East Germans who arrived over the
weekend decided to stay in the West, a sign that the new open-door
policy would not backfire.
   Lack of freedom to travel had been one of the major complaints
of hundreds of thousands of East Germans who abandoned their
Communist homeland permanently before the borders opened.
   ``It was something special, but anyway, things have to go on as
normal,'' said Peter Normann, an East Berliner who visited West
Berlin and then went home.
   West Berlin's bustling Kurfuerstendamm, the tree-lined shopping
thoroughfare that had been jammed with revelers, today was filled
with workers and shoppers.
   The carpet of shattered bottles, crushed cans, fast-food
wrappers and cigarette packs was swept up and hauled off overnight,
leaving behind few traces of the celebration.
   East Berlin Mayor Erhard Krack strode through a new breach in
the 28-year-old Berlin Wall on Sunday and shook hands with West
Berlin Mayor Walter Momper. The meeting took place at the Potsdamer
Platz, once the vibrant hub of a united Berlin.
   Momper, speaking this morning on NBC's ``Today'' show, said the
mayors discussed the need for coordination between authorities in
both sides of the city to handle the increased car and foot traffic
resulting from the new border policy.
   Today's announcement on the border areas covers both the
854-mile frontier between East Germany and West Germany and the
even more notorious stretch of land running along the Berlin Wall
in East Berlin. The borders had been one of the most closely
guarded sections of the Iron Curtain.
   In a highly symbolic gesture, West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker walked into East Berlin early today and met with a
high-ranking East German army officer on a piece of land forming
part of the abandoned ``death strip.'' The officer was not
immediately identified.
   The ``death strip'' had already lost much of its significance
after East Germans guards were ordered earlier this year not to
shoot at would-be civilian escapees and after East Germans began
fleeing by way of third countries.
   More than 200,000 East Germans left the country this year. The
exodus, combined with weeks of street protests, led to leadership
changes and pledges of democratic reform.
   The embattled Communist leadership is still struggling to find a
course that will satisfy growing demands for change while leaving
the existing party structure in place.
   Guenter Schabowski, a member of the ruling Politburo and East
Berlin's Communist Party chief, said the move to open the borders
showed that the East German leadership was serious about reforms.
   ``We took the correct and necessary steps in a complicated
situation and it has helped win back trust,'' the state-run news
agency ADN quoted Schabowski as saying.

<HEAD>Leftists Battle for Berth in Brazilian Presidential Election</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The two main leftist candidates appear
virtually tied for second place going into presidential elections
Wednesday, and the split has raised fears of a conservative victory.
   The leftists showed no signs of uniting to challenge the
conservative favorite in their last meeting, at a debate Sunday
night.
   ``We are leagues apart, and sometimes I even distrust many
positions of this citizen,'' Leonel Brizola, a former state
governor, said of his main opponent, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva.
   Da Silva, a congressman and former union leader popularly known
as ``Lula,'' countered by calling Brizola ``the heir of the Getulio
Vargas dictatorship,'' a reference to the populist president and
dictator who ruled Brazil for 20 years between 1930 and 1954.
   Fernando Collor de Mello, of the conservative National
Reconstruction Party, is expected to finish in first place
Wednesday, but it is doubtful he will win a majority.
   If no one wins more than 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will
be held Dec. 17 between the top two vote-getters.
   The last public opinion poll indicated Collor de Mello with 26
percent support, Brizola of the center-left Democratic Labor Party
with about 14 percent, and da Silva of the radical left Workers
Party with 13 percent.
   The only other candidate given a chance of winning the No. 2
spot is Sen. Mario Covas, of the center-left Brazilian Social
Democracy Party, with 9 percent.
   The survey was published Saturday in the newspaper O Globo and
was conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and
Statistics.
   In the debate, Brizola said da Silva, 44, was not qualified to
be president.
   ``We must reflect about the competence and capacity of the
candidates. Lula doesn't have experience and will be eating out of
the hand of others,'' said Brizola, 67.
   Da Silva responded that ``competence has little to do with age
or the number of positions held. The capacity of each can be seen
in the rallies where the people judge our work.''
   Da Silva has drawn crowds of hundreds of thousands at campaign
rallies and enjoys support from all classes and all parts of the
country.
   Brizola's support is largely limited to the states of Rio de
Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul, where he was governor.
   Collor de Mello, 40, a former governor of the tiny northeastern
state of Alagoas, has based his campaign on criticizing the current
president, Jose Sarney.
   His attacks on Sarney for the 1,300 percent annual inflation
rate and widespread corruption have struck a chord with voters, 75
percent whom earn less than $36 a week.
   The election will be Brazil's first popular presidential
election since 1960.
   Brazil's last leftist president was Joao Goulart, a vice
president who took power when Janio Quadros resigned in 1961 after
seven months in office. Goulart was overthrown in a 1964 military
coup.
   The military regime that ruled until 1985 banned direct
presidential elections. Sarney, a civilian, was chosen by an
electoral college controlled by the outgoing generals.

   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York on Monday
opened the first Vatican conference on AIDS by assailing the use of
condoms and the distribution of syringes to addicts as a means of
stopping the spread of the disease.
   He also urged that AIDS victims not be treated as outcasts,
perceived only as public health hazards and left to die.
   ``The truth is not in condoms or clean needles,'' O'Connor said.
``These are lies, lies perpetrated often for political reasons on
the part of public officials ... by some health care professsionals
who believe they have nothing else to offer persons with AIDS or at
risk ... lies told by often well-meaning counselors.''
   O'Connor was the first speaker at the three-day conference
bringing together more than 1,000 delegates from 85 countries,
including church officials, scientists, theologians and health care
workers.
   Robert C. Gallo, director of the Laboratory of Tumor Cell
Biology of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., said he
believes an anti-AIDS vaccine could be available for some patients
by 1991 or 1992.
   ``And we hope and believe that sooner than is often believed by
some scientific circles .. the problem will be solved,'' he said.
   The use of condoms in fighting AIDS has been a delicate issue
for the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes all forms of
artificial birth control and condemns homosexual activity.
   Monsignor Carlo Caffarra, an adviser on sexual issues to the
pope, said condom campaigns further expose society to AIDS because
``the means of protection are far from reliable.''
   ``In addition, their use encourages individuals to continue
their high-risk behavior,'' he said, citing homosexual activity.
   William Blattner, chief of the viral epidemiological section at
the National Cancer Institute, agreed that advocating condoms
``promotes risk behavior, as does the distribution of syringes for
drug addicts.''
   On Thursday in Baltimore, the U.S. bishops' conference dropped
earlier conditional support for condom education in schools and
urged that AIDS prevention instead emphasize chastity.
   During Monday's session at the Vatican, a man briefly
interrupted the proceedings when he approached the podium wearing a
sandwich board with the slogan ``The church has AIDS.'' The man,
identified by the ANSA news agency as a U.S. priest, was led out of
the hall by security guards.
   O'Connor said doctors have an obligation to discourage the
lifestyles that can cause AIDS, pointing out that an estimated 72
percent of AIDS victims in the United States contracted the disease
from homosexual acts and 17 percent from drug use.
   The Roman Catholic Church condemns homosexual acts, but not
homosexuals themselves, as immoral.
   ``Sometimes I believe the greatest damage done to persons with
AIDS is done by the dishonesty of those health care professionals
who refuse to confront the moral dimsensions of sexual aberrations
or drug abuse,'' O'Connor said.
   ``Good morality is good medicine,'' he added.
   Caffarra said married couples should choose abstinence if one of
the spouses becomes infected with AIDS. He also said doctors have
``the duty'' to advise one spouse if the other spouse has AIDS,
with or without the partner's permission.
   O'Connor expressed concern about the attitude toward AIDS
victims, saying they should receive the same love and treatment of
any other patients.
   He cited the contempt reserved for prisoners with AIDS, noting
``there is more than one horror story of a prisoner's being thrown
into a solitary cell and left to die.''
   He noted that by 1991 the cost of treating AIDS victims in New
York City alone will be $4.5 million each day.
   O'Connor said he was worried that the fear of AIDS could give
rise to temptations of abortions by pregnant women infected with
the AIDS virus.
   He also expressed fear that, as euthanasia gains acceptance
around the world, AIDS victims will increasingly seek to kill
themselves.
   Jonathan Mann, director of the World Health Organization's AIDS
program, said the agency estimates by the end of the year the
number of worldwide AIDS cases will rise to 600,000. He said the
WHO estimates that 6 million to 8 million people have been infected
by the virus.
   Mann said the number of people infected with the virus is
projected to increase two or three times during the 1990s, while
the total number of AIDS cases will probably increase by nine times.
   ``All in all,'' he said, ``the 1990s will be more difficult
compared to the preceding decade.''

   If being on the map is any measure of success, 36
small towns across the continent have hit the big time.
   Mad River, Calif., and Pasadena, Newfoundland, are among the
newest additions to the 1990 Rand McNally Road Atlas, along with
other newly discovered metropolises and such obscure points of
interest as Wyatt Earp's birthplace and a house made entirely of
paper _ except for the fireplace.
   Some of the towns added are so small they have no post offices
or municipal government.
   For instance, unincorporated Oak Run consists of 300 homes
centered around a private lake in the rolling hills of Illinois'
Knox County.
   It was added to the atlas because Rand McNally noticed it was on
the newest state highway map, said Michael Dobson, the company's
vice president of cartographic services.
   The additions of towns _ as well as rest areas, parks and points
of interest _ are among 19,536 changes in the Road Atlas' 66th
edition for the United States, Canada and Mexico, which goes on
sale nationwide this week.
   The suburban Skokie-based mapmaker updates the atlas each year,
deleting things like rest areas that have closed and adding
strategically located towns to make life easier for traveling
motorists, Dobson said in a telephone interview.
   Getting on the map is an ego-booster for East Lynne, Mo., a tiny
farming community that essentially consists of a post office,
grocery store, grain elevator, school and church.
   Donna Guggisberg, postmaster in the town of 286 people southeast
of Kansas City, wrote a letter earlier this year to Rand McNally
complaining that her town felt left out.
   ``I was just pointing out that it wasn't (on the map) and that
we'd like an answer,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Rand McNally responded with a letter saying ``that it was an
oversight and that they would put it on the map,'' Mrs. Guggisberg
said.
   ``The little farming communities are having a struggle and I
think for morale purposes it is an uplift,'' she said.
   In Oak Run, the new atlas is welcomed by realtor Jerrie Rudd,
who's trying to drum up interest _ and business _ in the area.
   ``People are interested in Oak Run ... but they can't ever find
it on the map,'' she said.
   But not everyone thinks being added to the atlas is good news.
   Merchants at the grocery store, burger bar and lodge in the
northern California hamlet of Mad River might like the idea, but
some residents would rather keep their serene little town a secret.
   ``People who live up here don't like the idea that tourists are
coming up here,'' said Bernadette Madonia, purchasing agent for the
Mad River Ranger District in Six Rivers National Forest.
   ``In fact, when they repaired the roads, people had a fit.''
   Dobson said company researchers ``discovered'' Mad River and
decided to add it to the atlas because of its location in a
recreational area.
   Other tourist-oriented additions include:
   _ The paper house in Pigeon Cove, Mass., built by a couple who
planned to live there but moved elsewhere when it became an instant
hit.
   _ A barbed wire museum in LaCrosse, Kan.
   _ The Monmouth, Ill., birthplace of legendary frontiersman Wyatt
Earp.
   ``Though debate still continues as to which house Earp was born
in, the town itself is his confirmed birthplace,'' Rand McNally
says.

   Singer Michael Jackson spent an evening at the
circus with a 4-year-old leukemia victim whose father earlier
triggered a court-ordered manhunt when he spirited the child away
from chemotherapy treatment.
   Darian Pagan of Brooklyn, and his family spent Saturday evening
in Santa Monica, Calif., with Jackson, 31, courtesy of a Long
Island-based charity, New York Newsday said in Monday's editions.
   Jackson, 31, his shoulder-length hair in curls, wore a black hat
and a black jacket with black-sequined cuffs and epaulets.
   ``He's shy, just like me,'' said the reclusive entertainer. ``It
makes me proud that this is his dream. I'm happy to fulfill it.''
   ``It's part of my gift to make everybody happy and to bring joy
to everyone, especially children like this,'' Jackson said. ``My
dream is to do a tour and see all the world's children, all the
hungry kids. Imagine that,'' he said.
   ``Just seeing his reaction made my day,'' David Pagan said
later, holding his sleeping son after Jackson left with two
shaved-head bodyguards.
   When officials from the charity, Wish is Granted, called, the
child's mother, Migdalia Pagan turned down offers of a bedroom set
or a Nintendo game. ``He wants to meet Michael Jackson,'' she said
she told them.
   Darian mimics Jackson's moonwalk dance step and watches his
music videos over and over, she said.

   Matt Frewer, the offbeat actor whose
wackiness helped him pull off the lead in TV's innovative ``Max
Headroom'' series, has another vehicle for his warped antics _ the
CBS comedy ``Doctor, Doctor.''
   It isn't clear where Frewer leaves off and his TV character, Dr.
Mike Stratford, begins. His maniacal laugh punctuates his
conversation.
   ``I think I got my sense of humor from my dad. He's pretty
weird, too,'' said Frewer. Six episodes of ``Doctor, Doctor'' ran
during the summer and CBS returned it to the lineup this week.
   Frewer's character has a bizarre bedside manner. He's a
fledgling novelist and a clumsy talk show doctor, the creation of
``My Favorite Year'' writer Norman Steinberg.
   ``I happened to be looking for a vehicle to go bananas in, and
Norman called and said that he had this new show and that I could
ad lib and improvise any time I wanted,'' said Frewer. ``That's not
an offer you get every day in a series, and it's a tribute to
Norman. He's secure enough that his words aren't sacred.''
   Frewer describes his Stratford character as a ``guy who has
trouble keeping his head above water because he has too much on his
plate.''
   ``But he never gets too deep that he can't find the humor in any
situation,'' he added.

   Laura Lord Scales, the oldest living
graduate of Smith College _ born when Rutherford B. Hayes was in
the White House _ turned 110 Monday, but she didn't see what all
the fuss was about.
   ``My age is absurd. I don't know where I get it,'' a frail but
vibrant Mrs. Scales said at a meeting Sunday with Smith President
Mary Maples Dunn.
   Mrs. Scales, who served as dean of students at the selective
women's college for 22 years, remains alert and still takes the
occasional stroll on fine afternoons. She lives at a retirement
home just a few miles from the campus she was a part of for so long.
   ``I am pretty sick today,'' she said. ``I wanted to make sure I
sound intelligent.'' In fact, the white-haired graduate, her face
framed by sturdy black spectacles, demonstrated a keen awareness,
asking about new developments at Smith and the welfare of ``the
girls.''
   Dunn congratulated the 1901 Phi Beta Kappa graduate on her
longevity and service to Smith. ``You are our most senior
citizen,'' she said.
   ``I hadn't thought of that,'' Mrs. Scales replied.
   She got a birthday card from President Bush, a letter from Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis and the introduction of a citation in the state
Legislature.
   Mrs. Scales was planning a low-key celebration, said Dorothea
Munro, an administrator at the retirement home.
   ``She said she's had too many birthdays anyway,'' Munro said.
``She said `I'll just come out for the dessert.'''

   Willard Scott says he's a success on NBC's
``Today'' show because he's not afraid to clown around.
   ``Fall on your face, tell a dumb joke, be a little bit of a
buffoon,'' Scott said in the Nov. 18 issue of TV Guide. ``Even
though people will just barely tolerate you and almost
embarrassingly shake their heads and say, `My God!' they'll always
invite you to the party.''
   Scott has appeared on air wearing only a barrel and dressed as
Carmen Miranda.
   ``I do make some stupid mistakes and say some dumb things, but
there's an honesty. And people know that I love them and that I
love what I do. And that's the secret,'' Scott said.
   When the weather forecaster from Washington, D.C., was first
hired, mail was so negative, the NBC staff hid it from Scott.
   ``Today'' co-anchor Jane Pauley said Scott overcame that initial
rejection.
   ``In the beginning, he was the cornball with his 100-year-old
birthdays,'' she said. ``It was an act no one with any pretense of
sophistication would buy. But that only lasted about three days _
one by one they fell. He simply resonates with such a broad range
of people.''

<TEXT>
   A dissident policeman who accused
riot squad members of brutality was arrested and suspended from the
force Monday after leading a protest against orders to transfer him.
   One other policeman and 11 prison guards who recently joined a
new union headed by Lt. Gregory Rockman also were arrested at the
demonstration. Police Commissioner Hennie de Witt said the second
policeman also was suspended.
   All 13 were released without bail after brief court appearances
where they were not charged. They are scheduled to reappear Nov. 23.
   Three private citizens were arrested at the demonstration and
released on bail. Eight journalists covering their protest were
detained for two hours, then freed. They included a camera crew
from ABC News.
   The dissident security officers were protesting in the
mixed-race township of Mitchell's Plain, Rockman's hometown,
against police orders to transfer him to a quartermaster's unit in
a white area of Cape Town. Rockman is mixed-race.
   Police also ordered the transfer of Col. John Manuel, the
commander of the Mitchell's Plain police station, who had supported
Rockman.
   De Witt said Rockman failed to report for duty Monday at the
quartermaster's office, rejecting a transfer that was ``in the
interests of good order and discipline.''
   The arrests occurred after Rockman and the other dissident
officers marched through a shopping area of Mitchell's Plain,
chanting in support of their union and against Rockman's transfer
order.
   After the court appearance, supporters carried Rockman on their
shoulders to a public square and shouted, ``Viva Rockman!''
   Rockman become an overnight hero to militant youths in
September, when he accused members of an all-white police riot
squad of behaving like ``wild dogs'' when they beat anti-election
protesters. That protest occurred at the same shopping plaza where
Rockman was arrested Monday.
   Two white officers were charged with assault in the September
incident. They were acquitted last month, but the judge criticized
the behavior of some men in the unit.

<HEAD>Nader, Common Cause Diverge on Raise Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KMOAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer activist Ralph Nader and the
president of Common Cause disagreed Monday on whether Congress
should take a proposed 33 percent pay hike, with Nader saying he'll
enlist talk-show hosts in his bid to kill the raise.
   Nader, who early this year successfully fought a proposed 51
percent pay hike, told reporters that Congress was ``at it again''
despite widespread public opposition to the earlier proposal.
   He said about 600 radio talk-show hosts would be contacted to
stir up opposition to the pay plan before leaders of the House can
bring it to a vote, perhaps late this week. The earlier raise
proposal was a favorite topic on talk shows.
   The new pay plan is more modest, with a 7.7 percent pay raise in
January and a 25 percent increase in January 1991. The raises would
apply to members of Congress, who are paid $89,500, and to top
executive branch officials and federal judges.
   The package was developed by a House bipartisan task force.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine said that a
majority of senators oppose the House plan and that the Senate
would consider accepting only the 7.7 percent January raise as a
cost-of-living adjustment.
   Congressional salaries were last increased in 1987, when
members' pay was raised from $77,400.
   The new increases would be tied to congressional ethics reforms,
including an end to members' padding their incomes by making
speeches to interest groups.
   Nader told a news conference he supported reform of
congressional ethics rules, but that should be done regardless of
the pay raise.
   ``I don't think people in this country like the idea of Congress
telling them that they will reform themselves only if they get a
pay increase,'' Nader said. ``That smells bad.''
   But Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, said lawmakers
were entitled to a pay increase if they give up their other sources
of income, as would be required by the ethics reforms.
   ``Members of Congress should only be working for one employer _
the citizens of this country,'' said Wertheimer, whose organization
lobbies for more stringent ethics rules.
   Wertheimer said he expected public opposition to the raise.
``People don't like them as a general proposition.''
   ``My view is that it is very important now for the Congress to
look at the long-term consequences'' and not the ``momentary
reaction,'' he said.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., defended the plan but
declined to discuss details with reporters.
   Foley said the plan would be ready for unveiling Wednesday and
House leaders had no intention of trying to sneak anything past
them.
   ``As usual, Mr. Nader is wrong,'' Foley said. ``It won't be
coming up in the dead of night, snuck through without a vote.''

   Everyone's heard of Brooklyn, N.Y.
   Practically no one's heard of this Brooklyn, which consists of a
school and a tavern. And the tavern is closed.
   But Brooklyn, Wash., is having its day in the sun, even if it's
only because of name familiarity.
   The tiny town in the Willapa Hills of southwest Washington is
featured in a television commercial for Burgerville U.S.A.
   Also featured is Bob Tomisser, superintendent of North River

   ``In Brooklyn, New York, you are conveniently located near Wall
Street, Yankee Stadium and Coney Island. Big Deal!'' Tomisser tells
the camera as he strolls out of the small school.
   ``You're also about 3,000 miles from one of these,'' he says,
holding up a large burger promoted in the 30-second spot.
   Then the camera pans back to Tomisser.
   ``Burgerville U.S.A. _ inconveniently located across the United
States,'' he says of the 31-restaurant chain in the Northwest.
   The commercial airs in Washington and Oregon, and Tomisser is
receiving royalties each time it's shown. Altogether, his one day's
work should bring in about $1,500.
   Incidentally, you can't get a Burgerville burger here, either.
The nearest Burgerville is nearly 100 miles away, in Centralia.
   The ad campaign for Burgerville plays off small towns that have
big-city counterparts.
   Another TV spot uses Detroit, Ore., in Oregon's Cascade

   Third-grader Jessica Plank receives mail almost
daily from people she has never met in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Last Friday was no exception. A correspondent sent a guidebook
and told her how the city's 300-year-old trees were destroyed by
Hurricane Hugo.
   Her fellow pupils get mail from other parts of the United States
in what has become a prodigious social studies project in the
third-grade class of Julia Shanabrook at Norman A. Trimmer
Elementary School in the West York Area School District.
   ``There are wonderful people in America who care enough about
strangers to go out, buy postcards, sit down and write to us,''
said Mrs. Shanabrook, 31, who has just begun teaching after
graduating from college.
   Each of the class' 25 students wrote to a newspaper editor in
two states requesting help in asking readers to send postcards and
share what makes their community special.
   On Friday, Mrs. Shanabrook distributed a 6-inch stack of mail
among the eager students. ``I get folders. I get boxes. I get
10-by-13-inch envelopes filled.''
   The mail helps the children learn about current events as well
as geography, she said.
   While the class has decided that ``Winston-Salem is probably the
most friendly town in the United States,'' Mrs. Shanabrook said
students had heard from people in 24 states.
   The children giggled at an Idaho postcard a picture of a single,
huge potato consuming the bed of a flatbed trailer.
   But Kushal Shah saw through the ruse.
   ``It's a regular potato,'' he said. ``They put it on a little
truck.''
   Twice one day last week students heard that Michigan is shaped
like a mitten. One person sent a foot-long mitten-shaped map.
Another wrote she lives in the thumb.
   Mrs. Shanabrook said a New Jersey television station producer
called about doing a story on what Morristown residents think is
special about their home. She told the producer ``they like General
Washington's headquarters.''

<HEAD>A Bomb? No, Just A Mummy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police were worried that a package left on
the steps of the University of Utah's Museum of Natural History
might contain a bomb. But an X-ray revealed the bones of a
1,000-year-old mummy.
   Authorities say the remains, packed into a Sears television box,
likely belong to member of the ancient Anasazi Indian tribe.
Anthropologists and pathologists say the rare find is among the
best preserved they have seen.
   Law enforcement officials believe looters carried the mummy from
its burial cave in the desert Southwest, where the Anasazi, or
``Ancient Ones,'' farmed and hunted from about 600 A.D. until 1350
A.D.
   Anthropologists say they are the ancestors of the Hopi and
Pueblo Indians of today.
   Second thoughts and stiff penalties for pilfering Indian
artifacts on federal or Indian lands probably led the anonymous
finders to ``donate'' the remains to the museum, University of Utah
Police Chief Wayne Shepherd said.
   Museum officials said they intended to give up the remains for
reburial. Authorities have contacted state and federal Indian
agencies, but no decision has been made on where or how the remains
will be reburied.
   Indian tribes strongly oppose allowing such remains to be
displayed in museums, believing it to be sacrilege. Pressure from
Indian groups recently prompted the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington to agree to return its Indian remains to tribes for
reburial.
   Shepherd said a University of Utah museum secretary received an
anonymous telephone call Oct. 11 from a woman who said her husband
had found a mummy, knew having it was illegal and wondered whether
the museum wanted it. The caller told the employee to look on the
back steps and hung up, Shepherd said.
   Police were called and, as a cautionary measure, took X-rays of
the box to ensure that it didn't contain a bomb. Instead, the
X-rays showed vague outlines of a human skeleton.
   Utah State Medical Examiner Dr. Todd Grey said he found the
mummy in ``remarkable'' shape, given its apparent age.
   ``It's a very rare find,'' added University of Utah
anthropologist John McCullough. ``We have very few specimens of
that time period available.''
   The professor said much valuable data was lost, however, because
the burial site is unknown.
   ``It's unfortunate from two aspects. Foremost is that a burial
was disturbed in a most unceremonious way. It's desecration,'' he
said. ``Second is that from an archaeological standpoint, whatever
information we could have gleaned has been largely lost.''
   Thousands of ancient Indian dwellings scattered throughout the
southwestern United States attract artifact hunters. Looting and
damage to potentially significant archaeological sites has led to
laws prohibiting scavenging on federal lands.
   The mummy was folded into a fetal position and covered with a
woven robe. Feathers or tufts of rabbit fur covered the lower
extremities. The skull, apparently severed during excavation, was
nestled in polystryrene packing material between the feet.
   The torso and legs were covered with a brown, parchment-like
skin. Fingernails and toenails were still evident.
   ``We don't see mummified remains that often,'' Grey said. ``I
see homicide victims who have been dead for two or three years and
they're bones.
   ``This is a really nice example of what can happen to human
remains in a dry, warm and protected environment,'' he added.
   That state of preservation has allowed Grey and McCullough to
draw a few conclusions about the mummy, which is believed to be
that of a woman in her 60s.
   While the exact age of the remains isn't known, McCullough
estimates it falls somewhere between 800 A.D. and 1200 A.D.
   The flattened back of the head suggests the remains are American
Indian, since Indians often strapped their infants to flat cradle
boards. The size and shape of the skull, and small size of the
skeleton, indicate the mummy is probably female, while compressed
vertebrae offer clues to her age.

   Field workers have ratified a new
contract with the nation's largest lettuce grower, ending an 18-day
strike that stalled the fall harvest.
   Bud of California, a subsidiary of the Castle &amp; Cooke
conglomerate, reportedly made a final offer that was similar to one
members of Teamsters Local 890 overwhelmingly rejected Nov. 2.
However, workers voted 2,240-248 for the ratification Sunday, said
union spokesman Raul Hernandez.
   Hernandez said workers agreed to the pact partly because of a
company commitment to increase the hours of senior employees. He
said many workers only worked three to four hours a day, and
sometimes only three days a week.
   Details of the agreement were not released. The company had
offered a raise of 8 cents an hour and overtime pay after nine
hours. Salvador Carrillo, Local 890 business agent, said workers
previously were paid $7.20 an hour.

<HEAD>Heart Studies: Getting Out of Bed Can Be Dangerous; Shoveling Often
Safe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Climbing out of bed in the middle of the
night can be ``a risky moment'' for the heart, but shoveling snow
may not be as dangerous as people have long believed, according to
two studies released Monday.
   In one of the studies, researchers monitored the hearts of
people with coronary artery disease while they slept. If they had
to get out of bed in the night, their hearts often experienced
potentially harmful periods of ischemia _ a temporary shortage of
blood.
   ``It seems that jumping out of bed and running around to do
something is a risky moment that we should think about,'' said Dr.
Andrew P. Selwyn of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
   On the other hand, researchers at the Medical College of
Wisconsin found that for active, physically fit people with heart
disease, shoveling snow is probably no riskier than other moderate
exercise.
   ``The feeling over the years has been that we should baby these
people,'' said Sara M. Dougherty, an exercise physiologist who
conducted the study. ``We want to get away from that. Shoveling is
not for everyone. But to say no one can shovel is just as much an
error.''
   However, she cautioned that people with heart trouble should not
shovel unless they have taken a treadmill test and consulted their
doctor.
   Both studies were presented Monday at the annual scientific
meeting of the American Heart Association. An estimated 28,000
people gathered in New Orleans to hear about 2,700 research reports
on heart disease.
   Many studies in recent years have attempted to pinpoint
activities that are especially risky for people with bad hearts,
looking for instances in which the heart's own muscle fails to get
enough blood. Sometimes this deprivation causes chest pain called
angina, but usually it is entirely painless.
   Researchers have found that mental stress can be an especially
powerful trigger of ischemia in those with underlying heart
disease. For instance, being asked to do simple math problems or to
give a public talk can raise the heart's demand for blood or lower
its supply, resulting in oxygen deprivation.
   In the Boston study, directed by Joan Barry, 30 people with
heart disease wore heart monitors while they slept. Twenty-one of
them got up at night, usually to go to the bathroom, a total of 36
times. On 24 of these occasions, their hearts showed signs of
painless ischemia.
   Selwyn theorizes that the blood vessels may be slow to adapt to
the heart's changing demands when people stand up after lying down.
Earlier studies have shown similar ischemic episodes when people
climb out of bed in the morning.
   Selwyn said it may be possible to control these activities'
effects on the heart with drugs such as beta blockers that fight
ischemia.
   In the shoveling study, researchers examined 14 men in their 60s
who had heart disease. Each was asked to shovel gravel for half an
hour at a temperature of 18 degrees. Each shovelful weighed about
12 pounds.
   The men had taken treadmill stress tests to measure their
maximum heart rates and oxygen consumption. While shoveling, they
reached 75 percent of their top heart rate and 63 percent of their
maximum oxygen consumption. None showed signs of ischemia.
   ``Shoveling was a safe activity for them,'' said Dougherty. ``It
was well within the guidelines we would give them for any other
activity.''
   She emphasized that while the men had suffered uncomplicated
heart attacks or had coronary artery disease, they were physically
fit and active. None ordinarily suffered chest pain triggered by
cold weather alone.
   She said that while there has been anecdotal evidence linking
snow shoveling with fatal heart attacks, her study appears to be
the first to actually examine this with heart patients.
   ``What we are looking at is getting away from the cardiac
cripple myth,'' Dougherty said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday enlisted 27 citizens,
including a medical pioneer, an admiral and a football coach, to
advise him in the battle against drugs.
   Bush signed an executive order at the White House creating the
new Presidential Drug Advisory Council.
   At a ceremony, Bush recalled that when he announced his
anti-drug strategy two months ago, ``I asked the question, `Who's
responsible?' Everyone who uses drugs. Everyone who sells drugs.
And everyone who looks the other way.
   ``This council is composed of people, leaders in each of their
fields, who will not look the other way,'' said Bush.
   The new advisers ``all share my goal of ridding America of
illegal drugs,'' Bush said.
   The panel, given a two-year lifespan, will be chaired by a
Dallas oilman, William Moss, and includes Dr. Jonas Salk, inventor
of the polio vaccine; former Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry, and
retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
   It also includes such corporate chief executives as Roger Smith
of General Motors and Robert Wright of NBC, as well as Dr. Burton
J. Lee III, the White House physician, and William French Smith,
attorney general in the Reagan administration.
   With drug policy director William Bennett at his side, Bush
urged the advisors to find better ways to:
   _Encourage employers to keep workplaces drug-free.
   _Enlist the aid of volunteers in the fight against drugs.
   _``Communicate to all Americans, especially our young, the
importance of staying off drugs.''
   _Coordinate existing private and non-profit antidrug efforts.
   _Involve the private sector ``in the building of prisons and
jails.''
   Bush unveiled a nearly $8 billion antidrug strategy two months
ago.
   Other panel members include:
   Alvin Brooks, director of the Kansas City, Mo., Human Relations
Department; Patricia A. Burch of Potomac, Md., a founder of the
National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth; James E. Burke
of Princeton, N.J., former chairman of Johnson & Johnson; Alvah H.
Chapman Jr. of Miami, former chairman of the board of Knight-Ridder
Inc.;
   Lee I. Dogoloff of Silver Spring, Md., executive director of the
American Council for Drug Education; Robert A. Georgine, of McLean,
Va., president of the AFL-CIO's Building and Construction Trades
Department; Elsie H. Hillman of Pittsburgh, Republican national
committeewoman for Pennsylvania;
   Mary L. Jacobson, co-founder of Parent Resources and Information
on Drug Education, Omaha, Neb.; Sterling Johnson Jr. of Laurelton,
N.Y., special prosecutor of the Special Narcotics Courts, New York
City; Ewing Kauffman of Shawnee Mission, Kan., chairman of Marion

   Scientists explaining the extent of
damage caused by ships that recently ran aground on coral reefs in
the Florida Keys can point to a reef hit by another ship five years
ago that still bears obvious scars.
   It can take 100 years for coral _ a hard shelter built up by
millions of tiny animals _ to grow one yard.
   ``We tend to think in human life spans, but coral reef life
spans are measured in the hundreds of years,'' said Alina Szmant, a
coral reef specialist at the University of Miami.
   Both humans and nature are putting pressure on the Florida
barrier reef, a tract of about 6,000 reefs extending from Miami
south along the Florida Keys to the Dry Tortugas west of Key West.
   ``This is the third-longest barrier reef in the world, and it's
got more tourism than any other reef,'' said Lynn Davidson, marine
habitat coordinator for Greenpeace International. ``We believe that
the coral is acting a bit like a canary in a coal mine. We know
they are very fragile, and they do respond very rapidly to stress.''
   The Florida reefs are smaller than only Australia's Great
Barrier Reef and the Caribbean reefs off Belize.
   New attention was drawn to the reefs by three ship groundings in
less than a month.
   On Oct. 25, the 155-foot freighter Alec Owen Matiland cut a
200-foot swath through a reef in the Key Largo National Marine
Sanctuary. Five days later, the 475-foot phosphate hauler Mavro
Vetranic scraped two to three acres of ocean bottom in the Dry
Tortugas in the far western Keys.
   On Saturday, a 470-foot cargo ship, the Elpis, was refloated off
a reef east of Key Largo after nearly 16 hours aground. Damage
there was still being assessed.
   In 1984, in the worst grounding of the decade, the ship Wellwood
scarred 128,000 square feet of coral on the marine sanctuary's
Molasses Reef. Even though sponges are moving in and coral larvae
are settling down, the damage is ``still readily apparent,'' said
sanctuary biologist John Halas.
   ``There has not been very much new coral showing up in that
area,'' said Ms. Szmant, who studies coral reef physiology in the
Florida Keys and Caribbean.
   But the human intrusion on the reefs _ home of 52 coral species
and 10 times as many fish _ extends well beyond the damage caused
by ships running aground.
   ``Other ways in which man can impact the reefs are anchor damage
and divers kicking and breaking coral, standing on the coral,'' Ms.
Szmant said. ``A lot of the boat traffic stirs up a lot of
sediments, which is bad for the coral. We've seen a lot of damage
done to the reef by just small boats.''
   Coral needs clear water that ranges in temperature from 68 to 86
degrees.
   ``They are in a fragile location to begin with. They're on the
northern edge of where coral grows,'' said Larry Fooks, assistant
manager of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, which receives
about 1.5 million visitors by boat each year. ``They're right at
the point where if the temperature drops too much and all the
conditions turn sour, they could go, too.''
   Dredging for construction clouds the water, fresh water runoff
from the Keys spoils the saline balance, and sewage and possibly
farm runoff from the Florida mainland carry unwanted nutrients to
the reefs. In addition, coral diseases that some scientists believe
are caused or influenced by man also have appeared in the last
three years.
   A variety of measures have been proposed to protect the coral,
including quotas on visitors, expanded sanctuaries and a shipping
buffer zone.
   ``We definitely need a good management plan to protect those
reef resources,'' said Manley Fuller, president of the Florida
Wildlife Federation, the 10,000-member state affiliate of the
National Wildlife Federation.
   ``It's important for the public to be able to see, experience
and enjoy nature. That's the future of conservation,'' he said.
``But we must guard against a situation of loving what we love to
death, and that's a real potential.''

   Industrialist Armand Hammer returns to work
Tuesday, four days after a heart pacemaker was implanted in his
chest.
   Hammer, the 91-year-old Occidental Petroleum Corp. chairman, was
released Sunday from UCLA Medical Center and his condition was
described as good, Occidental spokesman Frank Ashley said.
   Hammer, who has had heart trouble for more than 20 years,
received the pacemaker Friday. The device regulates electrical
activity in the heart so that it beats normally in a person who
suffers abnormal heart rhythms.
   Doctors told Hammer the pacemaker should protect him ``for at
least eight years,'' Ashley said.
   Hammer is nearly as well-known for his art collecting and
philanthropy as for his business acumen. He considers himself a
private ambassador for world peace and has met every Soviet leader
since Vladimir Lenin.

   Diane and Rube Wilcox lost their home and
three sons to a fire. Days later, they had a new house _ loaned,
outfitted and refurbished by their friends and neighbors.
   A sign outside the new house calls it ``the little house love
built.''
   Wednesday's fire claimed the life of Justin, Jake and Jared
Wilcox, who ranged in age from 5 to 10.
   In the aftermath, the community rallied around the popular
couple, donating more household appliances than the Wilcoxes could
use and fixing up the new house with astonishing speed.
   ``Everything has been unreal,'' said Jim Harper, one of those
who pitched in. ``We are all going to miss those boys, but we have
to help their parents get on with their lives.''
   Harper joined more than 70 people who spent nine hours Saturday
whipping the house into shape. It is being loaned to the Wilcoxes
rent-free for the next year by Lynn and Verla Davis, who own a
local real estate business.
   ``People were saying that we couldn't get it done in a day,''
Harper said. ``We proved them wrong. There were so many people here
helping out that we had to turn away some people who wanted to
help. There were people here I didn't even know.''
   The volunteers cleaned the house; installed electricity, new
carpeting, a septic tank, bathroom facilities, appliances and
telephones; set up a butane tank, painted and much more.
   ``Nothing we could do would be anything when you consider all
that those children's parents have done in this community,'' said
Vicki Leonard. ``We have to help them pull through this because
those children were their lives.''

<TEXT>
   Government forces battled
leftist rebels for control of the capital today in the heaviest
fighting the city has seen in a decade of civil war. At least 245
people were reported killed nationwide.
   Another 378 were wounded since the rebels attacked Saturday
night in their biggest offensive since 1981, according to the armed
forces funeral home, civilan morgues and hospitals and unofficial
military figures.
   Thousands of civilians were trapped in their homes by the
exchange of gunfire between Farabundo National Liberation Front
rebels and soldiers. Helicopters and military planes overflew the
city, shooting at rebel positions.
   Fighting also was reported outside Usulutan, a major eastern
city, but not in the city itself.
   The rebels, in their biggest offensive since 1981, dug trenches
and perched in tall buildings in San Salvador and attacked military
posts in at least four of El Salvador's 14 provinces. Fighting
began Saturday, and the sound of mortars and gunfire still echoed
through San Salvador's deserted streets early today.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Barry Jacobs said army troops had been
ordered to avoid civilian casualties and that was slowing the
counteroffensive.
   The rebels launched the offensive after pulling out of peace
talks to protest a series of attacks on leftist political and union
leaders, which they blamed on the U.S.-backed government.
   Rightist President Alfredo Cristiani, whose official residence
was attacked in the offensive's early hours, declared a state of
siege, rescinding basic civil rights and imposing a 6 p.m. to 6
a.m. curfew nationwide.
   Also targeted was the home of the president of the country's
legislature.
   Military and medical officials said at least 139 people had been
killed and 317 wounded since Saturday. It was not known how many
casualties occurred in the capital.
   Carlos Mendoza, a Red Cross spokesman, said at least 20
civilians were among the dead. They included an American teacher in
San Salvador.
   The U.S. Embassy in San Salvador refused to identify the
teacher, however a Spokane, Wash., woman said the victim was her
25-year-old son, Christopher Babcock.
   Kay Babcock told the Spokane Chronicle and Spokesman-Review that
Spokane police told her that her son was killed when he was hit in
the head by a grenade fragment late Saturday.
   The rebels claimed 400 soldiers were killed or wounded and gave
no casualty figures for their own forces.
   The northern section of San Salvador was held by heavily armed
rebels. It was the heaviest fighting in the city of 440,000 since
the war broke out 10 years ago.
   In the eastern suburb of Soyapango, where guerrillas also held
large sectors, a young fighter said rebels were holding their
positions. ``The order is that instead of retreating, we should
advance inside,'' Beatriz, the 18-year-old combatant, said.
   About 300 yards away, paratroopers took up attack positions.
Eight bodies, apparently of guerrillas, lay in the street.
   Area residents chatted with the guerrillas, complaining of food
and water shortages. Few tried to go to work, and many businesses
were closed.
   Late Sunday, rebel snipers took up posts in the high floors of
buildings and dug trenches with the help of San Salvador residents.
   ``All the northern zone (of the city) is classified as
critical,'' said Pedro Varela of the Red Cross. He also said some
eastern sections of the capital ``are very dangerous.''
   A church lay worker speaking on condition of anonymity said he
saw government helicopters bomb a camp of homeless people in
Emanual, a northern part of the city.
   He said five people died in one tin shack that took a direct hit
and that many were wounded as government forces tried to dislodge
rebels who had taken up positions in the area.
   A guerrilla leader who identified himself as Commander Fernandez
told reporters in a northern neighborhood, ``Here we will die
fighting. They won't remove us from here.''
   On national television, Cristianiannounced the state of siege,
suspending rights of assembly as well as free speech and movement.
   ``The terrorists must know that there are judicial tools to
fight these irrational attacks,'' he said.
   The rebels declared a nationwide ban on traffic and ordered all
gas stations to close. They enforce such bans with sabotage. Jacobs
said they also were attacking transit police.
   Both sides made public appeals for international support and
claimed they held the upper hand.
   Cristiani called the offensive ``indiscriminate terrorism.'' He
leads the rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, and
took office June 1 after winning a presidential election.
   His party has been linked to death squads that operated with
near impunity in the war's early years and are blamed for most of
its 70,000 deaths.
   The rebel Farabundo Marti Liberation Front, in a radio
broadcast, tied the offensive to the Oct. 31 bombing of the
National Federation of Salvadoran Workers union hall in the
capital. That attack killed 10 people and wounded more than 30, and
the rebels blamed it on the government.
   Rebel leaders on Wednesday pulled out of a third round of peace
talks with the Cristiani's administration, claiming it has not been
serious about negotiating an end to the conflict.
   In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called the rebel
offensive ``an act of desperation by a debilitated guerrilla
force.'' The U.S. government has backed successive Salvadoran
administrations in their war with the rebels.
   Government troops and a tank entered El Salvador National
University on Sunday and damaged some buildings when they opened
fire, a photographer said.
   Twelve students and workers were detained and taken to a
military base, according to the photographer. He said the prisoners
were accused of harboring guerrillas.

<HEAD>Judge Says More Funding Needed for Learning Disabled Criminals</HEAD>

   A judge with learning disabilities said Monday
more government funding is needed for juvenile criminals who have
reading troubles.
   ``If you can't read, there are only two ways to earn a living _
welfare and crime,'' Judge Jeffery Gallet of New York said. ``And
the truth is, crime pays more and has higher status in their
communities.''
   Gallet was a speaker at the first Learning Handicapped Offender
Conference. About 250 educators and corrections officials from
around the country are attending the meeting, which runs through
Wednesday.
   James Keeley, conference chairman and a correction education
specialist with the Pennsylvania Department of Education, said the
gathering is needed to share successful programs and policies.
   An estimated 20 percent to 40 percent of jailed juveniles and
adults have learning disabilities, said Stephen J. Steurer,
executive director of the Correctional Education Association in
Laurel, Md. The disabilities include any difficulties with math or
written language not caused by emotional or social malajustment in
a person of average or better intelligence.
   Steurer said federal, state and local governments have little
interest in funding special education programs for convicts.
``Nobody wants to do anything with people who get in trouble with
the law except lock them up,'' he said.
   Gallet, 47, a New York state family court judge, said he has
trouble spelling, following a line of type, distinguishing left
from right and doing math in his head. He was 32 when he found out
learning disabilities were at the root of his struggles in school,
causing him to graduate last in his college class. He now
compensates by using an index card to read, a calculator to add, a
watch to tell his right hand from his left and spell-check computer
software.
   Teen-agers with learning disabilities often become frustrated
and drop out of school, Gallet said.
   ``We know what happens to the girls. They become pregnant ...
And what happens to the boys. They turn to crime,'' he said. ``You
don't have to know how to read to carry a pound of cocaine from the
Port Authority in New York to Virginia in a little knapsack.
   ``By not paying the little bit now, we pay forever,'' Gallet
said. ``We pay because they steal from us. We pay because we have
higher insurance rates. We pay because we pay for their welfare. We
pay because we pay when they go into the adult (criminal) system.''
   Gallet pointed to a program run by the Bronx District Attorney's
Office as a model for young offenders with learning disabilities.
   Under the program, first-time offenders 16 to 21 who are
learning disabled can receive special education at the Opportunity
Center, which is run by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
   Thomas Olin, director of the Educational Outreach Program in the
Bronx District Attorney's Office, said the 2-year-old Opportunity
Center appeared to lower the rate of re-arrest of these offenders
from 50 percent to 25 percent.
   The Bronx District Attorney's Office spends $400,000 a year to
serve 100 young offenders who qualify for the Opportunity Center,
Olin said.

   Long known as an anti-establishment Communist
politician patiently awaiting his chance, new East German premier
Hans Modrow is a symbol of hope for wide-ranging political and
economic reforms.
   An engineer by trade and holder of a university economics
degree, the former Communist Party chief in Dresden is expected to
have much more clout as head of the cabinet than his colorless
predecessor, Willi Stoph.
   ``The East German economy is a shambles,'' says Guenther Buch, a
federal government researcher in Berlin who watches East Germany.
   ``It will be the strategy of the party to allow a shift of power
toward the council of ministers (Cabinet) to lighten the burden of
the economic disaster for the party,'' he said. ``The main
responsibility in coming weeks will be with Hans Modrow.''
   Analysts see Modrow, 61, as East Germany's equivalent to Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose domestic program of greater
openness and economic restructuring caught on among the East German
public and was the main trigger of the convulsions sweeping the
country in recent weeks.
   Many East Germans as well as Soviet officials made plain they
would have preferred Modrow in the post of East Germany's top
leader.
   Modrow has a reputation as a smart and modest Communist who
rejects hard-line policies. New Communist Party leader Egon Krenz
remains associated with those policies despite ceding to pressure
for change.
   Before the party announced his nomination as premier Wednesday,
East Berlin's party bosses appeared intent to keep him at arm's
length in Dresden, where he became party secretary in 1973.
   But he was never known to complain, stayed true to his
principles and became exceptionally popular in his district 115
miles south of Berlin.
   In June, central authorities singled him out for rare public
criticism, saying he failed to control ``bourgeois and enemy
views'' in Dresden after a large demonstration of citizens
demanding free travel to the West.
   Married and the father of two children, Modrow began his party
career as chief of the Communist youth organization in East Berlin
in 1953-61. He won election to the Central Committee in 1967 and
later held a propaganda post.
   He was once considered a protege and possible successor of
former leader Erich Honecker. But the prerequisite, a Politburo
post, eluded him until last week.
   Like Gorbachev, Modrow has made clear he thinks a policy of
suppressing problems is counterproductive.
   Buch said the shape and speed of reform depends on the cabinet
Modrow names and on how much power the reformers will have on a
revamped Central Committee expected to emerge from an extraordinary
meeting next month.
   For now, Modrow's appointment seems to be ``a signal from the
Politburo aimed at pacifying the broad masses,'' Buch said. ``We
must await the personnel and economic decisions in the next few
days.''

   A draft law lifting most travel restrictions on
Soviets passed its first legislative hurdle Monday and could
eventually unleash a flood of a half a million emigrants, Tass
reported.
   The proposed law is ``revolutionary for Soviet society '' and
considered by many to be nearly as radical as East Germany's recent
liberalization of its exit rules, the official news agency said.
   The bill allows emigration for virtually anyone who has entry
permission from another country and no outstanding alimony
obligations, criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets.
   It sets a basic limit of five years on the length of time a
citizen can be kept from emigrating because of access to secrets.
   The bill, which was given preliminary approval by the Supreme
Soviet legislature Monday, formalizes many changes that have
already been put into practice in Soviet emigration and travel
policy. The procedures required to obtain travel documents and
permission to emigrate have already been eased tremendously in the
last two years, releasing a flood of visitors and emigrants across
the Soviet borders.
   Soviet officials estimate 200,000 Soviets will have emigrated
this year and well over 2 million will have made visits abroad.
Most of the emigrants go to the United States or West Germany.
   Deputy Fyodor Burlatsky told the Supreme Soviet that current
predictions hold the new law will allow more than 500,000 people to
emigrate, and up to 8 million people will go abroad for visits next
year, Tass said.
   The officials acknowledge the main obstacles to travel have
become the heavy workloads of emigration authorities, shortages of
plane and train tickets, and problems with currency exchange.
   Supreme Soviet deputies said the visa-issuing agencies should be
expanded and more flights should be added, Tass reported.
   The problem of where the financially strapped country will find
hard currency to give its citizens to spend abroad will be more
difficult to resolve, the news agency added.
   The rubles earned by Soviet citizens are non-convertible. They
are generally not allowed across the borders and spurned in the
West.
   Before the current liberalization of travel regulations, tens of
thousands of Jews and other Soviets were refused exit visas,
becoming known as ``refuseniks.'' Their plight brought repeated
censure from the West.
   With less than 1 percent of applications to emigrate currently
being turned down, according to visa officials, few ``refuseniks''
remain. The government says they are all held on the grounds that
they had some access to secrets, but activists complain the secrecy
criteria are abused and applied arbitrarily.

   Hundreds of University of Massachusetts
students put down their books and picked up placards Monday to
boycott classes in a protest of state budget cuts that are forcing
fee increases.
   ``The state of Massachusetts must not be allowed to let the
younger generation pay for the mistakes of the present
generation,'' said Lisa Nelson, a junior from Sunderland and a
boycott organizer.
   The mood on campus was festive as picket lines snaked around
buildings and people carrying banners marched through the Student
Union. Nearly 2,000 of the campus' 25,000 students gathered on the
steps of the student center to hear speakers at an afternoon rally
calling for raising taxes, not cutting education.
   ``You need to convince your representatives and senators that
you are a force to be reckoned with _ that you will support them if
they support you,'' said history Professor Bruce Laurie, vice
president of the faculty union.
   Organizers said the length of the protest depended on enthusiasm
and participation by students at the university's Boston campus and
at other state schools.
   The boycott protested a $25 million cut in public higher
education brought on by Massachusetts' fiscal crisis. The Amherst
campus' share of the cutback is $6.4 million and follows a 5
percent slash ordered in July, said Paul J. Page, vice chancellor
for finance and administration.
   Laurie said an informal census among his colleagues indicated 60
percent of Monday's classes were canceled because of the boycott.
University spokesmen said they were still trying to determine the
extent of the boycott by early afternoon, but some classes were
being held.
   Chancellor Joseph Duffey, who was out of town Monday, said
earlier that the administration would not endorse a student strike
although he was sympathetic to their feelings.
   Deirdre Ling, vice chancellor for university relations and
development, said it was too soon to say if action would be taken
against striking students.
   At Thompson Hall, where four auditoriums normally are packed
with 200 and 300 students, only about two dozen students sat in
each room, said John Cole, president of the faculty union.
   The union was not actively involved in the strike, but it had
sent the students a letter of support.
   On Thursday, university trustees authorized boosting a special
student curriculum fee by up to $350 next semester in response to
the proposed cuts.
   The boost would raise the $165 fee at the Amherst campus to $515
and bring the university's total mandatory fees to $1,465. Tuition,
which was raised 8 percent this fall, is $1,512.
   ``They're raising the cost so much that they're cutting out the
poor people,'' said Jim Pak, a junior from Fairfax, Va.

<HEAD>White House Plays Down Role of Abortion in 1990 Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House suggested Monday that abortion
will not be a deciding factor in next year's elections and said
that divergent views were a ``matter of principle,'' not an issue
of politics.
   A conciliatory Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, also
voiced belated recognition to Sunday's abortion-rights rallies in
Washington and around the country.
   ``We certainly approve of the rally and are glad that they've
(participants) exercised their right to speak out,'' Fitzwater said
of the Washington gathering, which drew a crowd estimated at
150,000.
   Fitzwater's comments came in the aftermath of last week's
elections, in which Republican candidates who share Bush's
anti-abortion views were defeated by pro-choice Democrats.
   But Fitzwater suggested that, in spite of weeks of tough
anti-abortion talk and two vetoes of abortion-financing
legislation, Bush has no quarrel with those who support abortion
rights.
   Sunday's rally in the capital ``was expressing the views of a
lot of people who feel very strongly and very deeply about that
subject,'' Fitzwater said. ``Abortion is an issue that people feel
strongly about on both sides. It's a matter of principle.''
   Bush favors an anti-abortion amendment to the Constitution. He
vetoed two spending bills that would have expanded Medicaid
coverage to pay for abortions for poor women in cases of rape or
incest. The present law permits the use of federal funds for
abortions only when the mother's life is in danger.
   Fitzwater, who recently said that Bush would not hire anyone in
a policy-making position who did not share his views on abortion,
told reporters Monday:
   ``It's our belief that people should take a position on this
issue according to their strong moral and religious and personal
beliefs, and that should be the deciding factor, not politics.''
   At a news conference Tuesday, Bush said that both the Democratic
and Republican parties are ``broad enough to contain differing
views on this.''
   Still, in an interview in Dallas on Saturday with Texas
reporters, Bush complained that ``the pro-abortion people ... want
dealer's choice on abortion and they think that they see a wind of
change that will help their cause.''
   Asked about polls suggesting pro-choice positions helped
Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia last
week, and in the New York mayor's race, Fitzwater said, ``We think
there were a lot of issues.
   ``Any number of factors resulted in the victories and the losses
for the particular candidates there. Abortion was an important
issue. But ... people don't decide elections on one issue,'' he
said.
   Asked if the White House shared a concern of some GOP
strategists that the abortion issue could hurt GOP candidates in
1990, Fitzwater replied, ``No.''
   Fitzwater's comments came as abortion-rights activists were
pledging to channel their energy from last week's election
victories into 1990 political campaigns.
   Bush's own position on abortion has had a number of twists and
turns. For instance, in his 1980 presidential campaign he said he
supported the 1973 Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing
abortion.
   More recently, however, he has called for a constitutional
amendment banning abortion except to protect the mother's life or
in cases of incest or rape.
   His position differs on the question of using federal funds to
pay for abortions for poor women. There he favors using tax dollars
for the procedure only when the woman's life is in danger _ and not
in cases of rape or incest.
   And, although he initially suggested he was flexible on the
point of federal funds, he later abandoned an effort to reach a
compromise with Congress _ and vetoed two spending bills over
provisions expanding Medicaid-financed abortions to cases of rape
and incest.

   Astronauts, cosmonauts and
scientists from around the world urged their nations Monday to
develop a way to rescue people who become lost in space.
   The Association of Space Explorers, whose members include space
travelers and scientists from the United States and the Soviet
Union, said a universal method of retrieving stranded astronauts is
crucial.
   ``Since search and rescue is a humanitarian effort, it should
not be difficult to achieve cooperation among national and
international organizations ...,'' U.S. astronaut Vincent White
told the congress.
   Fifty-five members from 14 countries held the group's 5th annual
conference in Riyadh to discuss ways to harness space technology
for peaceful purposes.
   The congress noted the growing number of space flights and has
been examining various ways to set up a space rescue system.
   ``The frequency and numbers of people traveling in space has
increased dramatically in the last three decades,'' the congress
said. ``Consequently, the likelihood of emergency situations
requiring a rescue effort has also increased.''
   Soviet cosmonaut Alexander Alexandrov told the congress that
nations must pool their resources to develop such a system.
   ``It is practically impossible for any nation to go it alone as
far as rescue in space is concerned,'' he said. ``Efforts of all
(spacefaring) powers must be united to attain this goal and avoid
loss of human lives in space.''
   The association, which has 72 members representing 17 nations,
was preparing proposals to govern the proposed space rescue system.
   U.S. astronaut John-David Bartoe suggested a worldwide
communications network ``ensuring contact with any point on the
earth's surface, airspace, and near space _ methods must be
developed to make possible the search for, and immediate evacuation
of persons involved in accidents, of extending first aid ....''
   U.S. astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts agreed on the necessity of
getting their governments to accept the idea of setting up an
integrated space rescue system.
   Soviet participants also told reporters that Moscow was ``ready
and eager'' to carry out a joint U.S.-Soviet flight to Mars.
   Alexei Leonov, chairman of the Soviet wing of the association,
said a joint flight to Mars would be less costly.
   Indian space scientist Yash Pal warned nuclear powers against
dumping toxic and nuclear waste in space. He said using space for
military purposes would lead to the ``end of the world.''
   The host for the meeting is Prince Sultan bin Salman, the first
astronaut from an Arab country. Salman, a major in the Royal Saudi
Air Force, flew on the U.S. space shuttle Discovery in 1985.

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told
Polish lawmakers Monday a unified Germany would be important and
precious for Poland.
   Kohl met with about 80 members of the Sejm, or parliament, and
the Solidarity-dominated Senate, for more than two hours. His
spokesman, Hans Klein, said about twice the number of lawmakers
than expected showed up for the meeting.
   Senate Marshal Andrzej Stelmachowski, a constitutional lawyer
and Solidarity adviser, said after the meeting he was satisfied
with the talks.
   Stelmachowski said Kohl told the Polish lawmakers the process of
democratization must be combined with the unification of all of
Europe.
   ``In general, he (Kohl) thinks that the process of reunification
would be a process connected with the general process of
unification of Europe, and the 21st century would not be a time of
national states,'' Stelmachowski said.
   He said Kohl had stressed that for Poland, a Germany integrated
with Europe would be ``important and precious,'' and outlined a
general concept in which ``freedom would be more important than
borders.''
   West Germany has pledged in a 1970 treaty to respect the Oder
and Neisse rivers as Poland's western borders, but a reunified
Germany is not committed to those terms.
   West German conservatives recently suggested reunification be
sought within the 1937 borders of the Reich, which included about
one-third of present-day Poland. Those statements have aroused
concern in Poland.
   Kohl told his audience more than 80 percent of those West
Germans who were asked said thay favored respecting the Oder and
Neisse rivers as Poland's western borders, the senator said.
   Klein said the chancellor also talked about economic aid, easing
Polish fears that increased West German financial help for East
Germany might force reductions in the level of aid for Poland.
   The spokesman assured the Poles that was not the case,
especially since Kohl was aware that without the prior events in
Poland and Hungary, reform in East Germany would not have been
possible.
   The Solidarity-led government believes Western aid is essential
for Poland to make the transition to a market economy and secure
democratic reforms.
   Klein had said Sunday night after Kohl met President Wojciech
Jaruzelski and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki that more West
German aid would have to be concentrated on East Germany.
   Kohl had broken off his visit to Poland on Friday so he could
attend an emergency Cabinet session in Bonn on the events in East
Germany.
   Stelmachowski said Kohl stressed he had returned to Poland to
give a sign that his country planned to continue the policy being
implemented before East Germany opened its borders.
   Kohl said nothing should be changed in that policy, according to
the senator. Last week, both sides signed agreements worth $1.5
billion in economic assistance.
   Earlier Monday, Kohl traveled to the southeastern city of
Lublin, where he was awarded an honorary degree. He said that he
realized reunification, which would result in a nation of 80
million people, concerned not only Germans but their neighbors as
well.
   ``Today a new departure is announcing itself in the German
Democratic Republic. How could it be otherwise at a moment when the
wind of liberty unfolding on Europe,'' he said.
   Kohl thanked Poles who have come out in favor of reunification
as a way of overcoming totalitarianism.
   He appeared to be referring to Adam Michnik, a Solidarity deputy
and editor of the pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza and
Bronislaw Geremek, Solidarity parliamentary leader.
   The two historians have said a de-Stalinized East Germany would
be beneficial for Poland.
   Kohl said he ``was moved and profoundly grateful to see that
prominent Poles are among the first to demand naturally liberty and
the right to self-determination for East Germany. I would like to
thank them for such a frank engagement and courage in favor of
liberty.''
   But Kohl added that he realized the future of the two Germanys
``does not leave any one of our neighbors indifferent,'' and said
the German national destiny lies within Europe as a whole.

   Congress is being urged by state college
officials to double the science education budget to confront a
crisis that they say could result in America becoming a second-rate
nation.
   A report to be released later this week by the American
Association of State Colleges and Universities proposed that half
of the increase in science education be used to upgrade
undergraduate science instruction.
   ``America will be a second-rate nation,'' said the president of
Florida A&amp;M University, Frederick A. Humphries. He pointed to
predictions that there will be a shortage of 700,000 science and
technology professionals by 2000.
   Science education, he says, is in crisis.
   ``We have to start channeling more of our resources into
programs improving undergraduate science education and offer more
support to college instructors committed to teaching science to
college and university students,'' said Association President Allan
Ostar.
   Humphries, chairman of the association's committee on science
and technology, and other committee members said the report will be
released at the group's annual meeting in San Francisco.
   The report, partly funded by the National Science Foundation,
predicted that channeling funds to undergraduate science education
has the ``potential to be the catalyst for reforming the total
science education pipeline of the nation.''
   ``We must raise the quality of science education at every level,
expand participation in science by all students and encourage more
students to choose careers in engineering, science and science
teaching and to do all that we need more money,'' Ostar said.
   The report, ``Formula for Reform: The Role of the Comprehensive
University in Undergraduate Science and Engineering Education,''
offered three recommendations:
   _Double the National Science Foundation budget within the next
five years, bringing it to about $3.6 billion.
   _Divide all new appropriations for the foundation equally
between science and engineering education and research and related
activities.
   _Develop a broad geographical base for the nation's research and
science education activities.
   The report noted that President Bush has proposed that the
budget for the National Science Foundation be doubled and, while
enabling legislation has been passed by Congress and signed into
law, the actual appropriations have not been approved. The
universities pledged to work for the money.

   Nearly 300,000 demonstrators

   Whistles, jeers and shouts of ``Faules pack!'' _ German for
``lazy bunch _ rang out as the crowd marched past the city
headquarters of the once-dreaded Stasi, East Germany's secret
police.
   Two Communist Party officials who tried to address the crowd
were drowned out by boos, whistles and jeers.
   The crowd chanted repeatedly, saying ``Wir vind das volk!'' _
``We are the people!''
   ``The mood is getting a little bit too militant for me,'' said
party member Uwe Dreilich, 32. He said he had been present at all
the Leipzig demonstrations in the past two months.
   ``I am for free elections but I think we must be careful that
this does not get out of control,'' he said.
   Witnesses estimated the crowd at nearly 300,000 people.
   The demonstration was the seventh in as many weeks in Leipzig.
But the crowd was smaller than the up to 500,000 who have turned
out previously.
   Before the march, Leipzig leaders of East Germany's biggest
opposition group, New Forum, hailed East Germans' new freedom to
travel but insisted there be free elections and other moves toward
genuine democracy.
   Earlier in the day, about 2,500 people crowded in Leipzig's St.
Nicholas Church, the center of the mass pro-democracy movement that
has engulfed the country, forced the ouster of longtime communist
leader Erich Honecker and compelled promises of sweeping reform.
   Pastor Christoph Kaeler compared what he called East Germany's
``peaceful revolution'' and the resulting opening of the Berlin
Wall with the collapse of the walls of Jericho.
   ``For seven Mondays the people of Leipzig marched around the
city and called, `We are the people,' and then the wall fell right
down,'' he said to massive applause.
   He thanked nations in East and West _ but did not specify which
ones _ for supporting East Germany's pro-democracy movement.
   ``Without their contribution, our walls would not have
collapsed,'' he sai.
   Jochen Lessig, a prominent member of the New Forum in Leipzig,
also warned against swift German reunification when he addressed
the crowd in Karl Marx Square after the service.
   ``It would be easy after years of being told what to do by big
brother in the East just to link up with the West,'' he said, but
urged caution before rushing to imitate capitalist West Germany.
   ``Free elections, free elections,'' the crowd chanted in
response.
   To wild cheering, the next speaker, Michael Groetsch, said,
``We've grown to love these Mondays on the Leipzig streets. Monday
is the symbol of our liberation and it must stay that way.''

<HEAD>Government Sets Efficiency Standards for Fridges, Freezers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department on Monday announced that
refrigerators and freezers built after 1992 will have to use 25
percent less energy than today's models.
   The efficiency gain will save consumers nearly $20 a year in
electricity costs, the department said.
   The decision drew quick criticism from the appliance industry,
which contends the technology to meet the new standards does not
exist and is not likely to by 1993.
   ``Shell-shocked, that's how we react,'' said Frederick Hallett,
vice president of White Consolidated Industries, maker of Philco
and other refrigerator brands.
   ``This is akin to telling the automobile industry it has to have
a mileage standard of 50 miles a gallon,'' Hallett said, adding
that the tougher requirements ``will force some refrigerators and
freezer off the market'' by 1993.
   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, said in announcing
the new standards that the department considered five possible
efficiency standards and chose a mid-point option that ``strikes a
reasonable balance between what is technologically feasible and
economically justified.''
   The new standards, effective Jan. 1, 1993, will raise the retail
price of refrigerators and freezers by an average 10.5 percent, but
the extra cost will be offset in less than 2{ years by savings from
a lower cost of running the appliances, Moore said.
   For the most common model of refrigerator _ those with
top-mounted freezers and automatic defrost, comprising 70 percent
of the market _ the average retail price will rise from an
estimated $513 for the basic 1990 model to $559 for the equivalent
1993 model, Moore said.
   However, he said it will take nearly $20 a year less in
electricity to run the appliance, which is the largest user of
electricity in many American households.
   The reduced power requirements will save the nation the
equivalent of 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity, or the output
of four large power plants, between 1993 and 2015, assuming the
efficiency standard remains constant over that period, Moore said.
   The department is also considering new energy efficiency
standards for television sets and 11 other types of household
appliances, as required by a 1987 law.

<HEAD>Declining Contributions Threaten Public Campaign Financing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal fund that pays for the nation's
presidential campaigns is still suffering from declining income,
threatening public financing of the quadrennial battle for the
White House, the chairman of the Federal Election Commission says.
   FEC Chairman Danny Lee McDonald wrote members of Congress
earlier this month to say that fewer and fewer Americans are
checking the box on their tax returns to send $1 to the campaign
fund.
   Through August of this year, McDonald said only $31.1 million
had been deposited in the fund from check-offs on 1988 tax returns.
If the trend holds, he said, the fund will receive less this year
than the $33 million pumped in last year.
   ``The balance of the fund has shrunk dramatically due to the
inflationary pressures on the payouts to candidates,'' McDonald
said in his letter. ``If the trend continues, ... by the end of the
1996 presidential campaign, the balance will be in a negative
position.''
   The payments to presidential campaigns are increased by
inflation in each election cycle _ whether or not the fund's income
has increased. The FEC pointed out this trend to Congress earlier
this year, and asked Congress to look for ways to remedy the
situation.
   The money from the check-off is used to match individual
contributions to presidential candidates' primary campaigns and to
pay the entire cost of the general election presidential race for
the two major party candidates.
   Primary candidates who raise a certain minimum amount of money
can apply for federal funds to match dollar-for-dollar the amounts
of individual contributions of $250 or less. Since overall primary
spending is capped, there is also a limit to the amount that can be
matched.
   In the general elections, major party candidates can accept no
private contributions and must rely completely on federal funds.

<TEXT>
   West German officials, seeking to calm
fears of a possible reunification of Germany and its impact on
NATO, on Monday reaffirmed the nation's commitment to the alliance
and to the European Community.
   Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ``will be a cornerstone in the policy'' of West
Germany. He spoke at a meeting of the Western European Union, a
group of West European foreign and defense ministers.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said that for West
Germany, ``the issue is membership in the European Community ...
and the issue is to stay in the Western alliance.''
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel told fellow finance ministers at
the European Community that West Germany remains in favor of the
trading bloc's push to create a single, or internal, market in late
1992.
   ``West Germany certainly reaffirmed in clear-cut terms its
commitment to the European Community, and I don't think there is
any doubt about that,'' said John Major, Britain's chancellor of
the exchequer.
   The community wants to dismantle by late 1992 the many trade
barriers that prevent the free movement of people, money, goods and
services among the dozen nations.
   At a regularly scheduled meeting Monday, the finance ministers
devoted much of their time to the difficult issue of how to forge
an economic and monetary union. But they took time out to discuss
the extraordinary changes in Eastern Europe.
   East Germany's unexpected opening of its western borders has
sparked debate over the possible reunification of the two Germanys
and its potential impact on Western alliances.
   Even before the developments in East Germany, there had been
discussion of the future role of the 16-nation NATO alliance in an
era of reduced East-West tensions.
   Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens said the foreign and
defense ministers of the nine-nation Western European Union
``agreed that the big clamor rising from the East must find an echo
in a more consistent, more solid, more coherent European
Community.''
   He said it was ``an absolute necessity'' for the Common Market
nations to move ahead with their plans for closer ties.
   Eyskens, who is chairman of the group, said it was in the
interest of all that ``the East has in front of it a solid partner,
steady, credible, with sufficient economic capacity to help it.''
   He said participants at next month's scheduled summit of
European Community leaders in Strasbourg, France, should give a
``signal to the East'' of a willingness to cooperate as they move
to more open economic and political systems.
   The Western European Union brings together foreign and defense
ministers of Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the
United Kingdom, West Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal, all of
which are members of the European Community and NATO.

<HEAD>Baker Met With Bulgarian Leader In September</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James Baker met in
September with Petur Mladenov, the new leader of Bulgaria who
served as foreign minister at the time, the State Department said
Monday.
   Baker met with Mladenov at the U.N. General Assembly as part of
a series of meetings with foreign ministers from around the world,
and the conversaton focused primarily on the expulsion of ethnic
Turks from Bulgaria, said spokesman Richard Boucher.
   Mladenov was Bulgaria's foreign minister until he was named
general secretary of the Communist Party to replace Todor Zhivkov,
the veteran party boss who resigned in a surprise move last week.
   Boucher discounted a report in The Washington Post on Saturday
which said the Baker-Mladenov meeting was held in secret. ``It was
laid on late in the week, and it was the last meeting before they
returned (to Washington) and nobody asked,'' he said.
   Baker consulted Turkey beforehand and the Turkish foreign
minister supported the meeting, Boucher said.
   ``It was a meeting during which the Secretary made clear, I
think in the strongest possible terms, that the United States
needed to see improvements in the human rights situation in
Bulgaria, particularly as regard Turkish nationalities.''
   More than 300,000 Bulgarians of Turkish origin have fled their
country this year to protest harsh treatment by Bulgaria and forced
assimilation. Most have gone to neighboring Turkey.
   Boucher said Baker and Mladenov also discussed the need for
political reform in Bulgaria.
   ``Then-Foreign Minister Mladenov spoke very positively about the
need for constructive change,'' Boucher said. ``But as for the
situation now, we feel that the new general secretary faces a very
difficult challenge in bringing needed reforms to Bulgaria, and we
hope that he will move vigorously to build a more open and
democratic Bulgaria.''
   Bulgaria has only a fledgling opposition movement, unlike some
of the other eastern European countries such as Poland and Hungary.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``it's too early to
comment on any new directions the country may be taking. We just
don't have enough information.''

<TEXT>
   The Congress of People's Deputies, the supreme
organ of the Soviet government and forum for televised diatribes
about all the country's ills, will convene Dec. 12, the legislature
decided Monday.
   The Congress is the centerpiece of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's political reforms. He called its first session in late
spring ``the most outstanding event in the entire history of the
Soviet state.''
   Its 2,250 deputies were elected in the country's first
competitive elections in more than 70 years, and many spoke out
against everything from the KGB to the empty shelves in Soviet
stores.
   The agenda for the coming session will include discussion of
radical measures to improve the economy and the fight against
rising organized crime, Tass reported Monday.
   The Congress will also consider changing the electoral system
and bills on ``constitutional compliance,'' a reference to the
growing number of parliaments in restive Soviet republics that have
passed laws contradicting the country's constitution.
   Deputies of the Supreme Soviet legislature, which was elected by
the Congress, also proposed Monday that the Congress address the
article of the constitution that makes the Communist Party the
``leading force'' in Soviet society, but their motion failed by
just a few votes, Tass said.
   The constitutional article on the Communist Party has come under
increasing fire in recent weeks, including among striking coal
miners in the Soviet Arctic, who included cancellation of the
article in their demands.
   The first Congress of People's Deputies was broadcast live on
national TV. Whether that practice would be repeated was in
question because Soviet leaders complained that the whole country
watched with such rapt attention that productivity dropped
significantly.
   Gorbachev lauded the first Congress as heralding ``a new stage
of perestroika,'' his program of reforms.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, who was also a deputy
to the Congress, said on the final day that the session had failed
in its primary mission as he defined it: to establish an effective
new system of power.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department will end its court
appeals involving the delayed Iran-Contra case against former CIA
station chief Joseph Fernandez, a department spokesman said Monday.
   Dan Eramian said the department would not contest a Sept. 29
appeals court ruling which concluded the power to appeal decisions
on classified material rests in the hands of Iran-Contra prosecutor
Lawrence Walsh.
   ``We are pleased that the Justice Department has decided not to
delay the Fernandez case further by additional appeals,'' Walsh's
office said in a statement. ``We are prepared to proceed to trial.''
   Eramian noted, however, that the Justice Department reserves the
right to file an affidavit in court in the Fernandez case barring
the disclosure of classified material that would damage national
security.
   Fernandez, an ex-CIA operative in Costa Rica, was scheduled to
go on trial July 24, but the Justice Department obtained an
emergency stay from the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.,
after the CIA said it needed to protect certain classified
information that Fernandez wanted to use in court.
   The material concerned three CIA locations, including stations
in Honduras and El Salvador, and three CIA programs in Costa Rica.
   Filing an affidavit in court could scuttle some or all of the
criminal charges against Fernandez. That, in turn, could lead to
court appeals by the independent counsel's office in an attempt to
save the case.
   The Justice Department appealed after U.S. District Court Judge
Claude Hilton rejected prosecutors' proposals to substitute numbers
for the names of the three CIA locations and to drop part of one
criminal charge against Fernandez to avoid mentioning the CIA
programs in Costa Rica.
   Fernandez, who assisted Oliver North's secret Contra re-supply
network, is accused of obstructing the Tower Commission and the CIA
inspector general's office and making false statements in the
Iran-Contra affair.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Navy destroyer that collided with a
Panama-registered freighter, killing one crewman and injuring five
others, reached Singapore waters Monday.
   The destroyer Kincaid sailed through the Strait of Malacca under
its own power and was met by tugs to escort it to the Sembawang
Shipyard for emergency repairs.
   The officer killed in the collision early Sunday was identified
as Lt. Sean Michael McPhee, 24, a navigator, said Cmdr. David
Dillon, spokesman for the Naval Surface Force in San Diego, where
the destroyer is based.
   He did not release McPhee's hometown nor the names of the
injured, pending notification of their families.
   At Subic Bay in the Philippines, 7th Fleet spokesman Lt. Joe
Gradisher said none was seriously hurt.
   The Navy said the Kincaid has a crew of 20 officers and 297
enlisted men.
   It was the latest in a series of accidents involving U.S. Navy
vessels the past two weeks.
   The Kinkaid was en route from the Indian Ocean for a scheduled
port call in Singapore when it collided with the 430-foot freighter
Kota Petani in the Malacca Strait, 240 miles northwest of this
island-republic. The busy strait runs between the Malaysia and the
Indonesian island of Sumatra.
   Lt. Cmdr. Bob Anderson, a spokesman for the Pacific Fleet
headquarters at Pearl Harbor, said the accident tore a
15-by-56-foot hole above the waterline on the right side of the
destroyer.
   The 13,687-ton Kota Petani sustained major damage to its port
bow but no injuries were reported aboard the freighter. It is owned
by St. Vincent Grenadies of Panama and managed by Pacific
International Lines (PIL) of Singapore. A PIL executive said the
ship left Singapore last week with cargo for the Middle East.
   Fires broke out on both ships and were quickly extinguished with
help from the USS Rentz, a guided-missile frigate accompanying the
Kinkaid. The Kinkaid and the Rentz were detached on Nov. 5 from the
U.S. Navy Middle East Force in the Persian Gulf after a three-month
deployment, according to records kept by The AP at Bahrain.
   Richard M.D. Gong, director of the U.S. Information Service here
said an investigation is underway into the cause of the collision.
The PIL executive said his company planned its own investigation.
   Anderson said the five U.S. Navy shipboard accidents the past
two weeks were just bad luck.
   ``It's really an inherited danger in working on a warship, but
we don't feel it's a training problem and these accidents are
totally unrelated to each other, and it's just unfortunate,'' he
said.
   On Oct. 29, a training jet crashed aboard the aircraft carrier
USS Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico, killing the pilot and four
sailors on the ship. The next day a sailor fell off the carrier USS
Carl Vinson north of Wake Island in the Pacific Ocean and was
presumed lost, and an FA-18 pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the
guided missile cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean, injuring
five sailors and blowing a small hole in the bow.
   On Oct. 31, three sailors and $4 million worth of non-nuclear
missiles were swept by a wave from the carrier USS Eisenhower near
Cape Hatteras, N.C. One sailor was missing and presumed dead.
   The next day, nine sailors suffered smoke inhalation and four of
those were treated for burns after a boiler fire aboard the USS
Monongahela west of Gibraltar.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle said
Monday that the reunification of East and West Germany is
inevitable some day, and that the rejoined nation will be ``allied
with the forces of freedom and democracy.''
   Quayle said it won't happen soon, ``but you're going to see it
and it will be oriened toward western values.''
   In a speech to the Republican Governors Association and an
interview with a group of reporters, Quayle said President Bush has
taken the lead in dealing with the changes sweeping eastern Europe.
He said that it is the Democrats, not the president, who have been
timid in handling change, at home and abroad, and that all they
want to do is spend more money.
   The vice president told the governors that the 1980s were a
Republican decade because the party delivered on the central issues
of peace and opportunity.
   He said he was not going to second guess the GOP defeats in
off-year elections last Tuesday. He said Republicans can broaden
their constituency and build ``a governing conservatism'' in the
1990s.
   ``The Democrats haven't had a new idea for 30 years,'' Quayle
said.
   Sixteen of the 22 Republican governors were on hand for the
resort island conference. Their ranks will dwindle to 21 when New
Jersey switches to a Democrat in January.
   But Quayle said Republicans can gain command by taking the lead
on issues such as education, the environment, drug control and
economic competition.
   ``On the issue of peace, we have reaffirmed once and for all
that a commitment to a strong national defense and an investment in
national defense pays dividends,'' he said. ``What is going on in
Eastern Europe today is no accident. ...''
   But he also said the United States faces a continuing Communist
challenge in Nicaragua, Cuba and El Salvador. ``Despite whatever
Soviet intentions may be, there is no doubt that their clients in
this region are conducting war and terror,'' he said.
   Quayle said that will be one of the issues discussed when Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev meet Dec. 2 and 3 off
Malta.
   The vice president said that Bush ``has been out front'' in
dealing with the changes sweeping eastern Europe and that the
president has been properly cautious because a misstep could be
counter-productive.
   Bush has said that he favors eventual German reunification, but
that he isn't pushing it or trying to set a timetable.
   Quayle did neither, but his comments were more forceful than the
president's.
   ``The Democrats haven't offered one creative idea on how to
manage the evolving situation in eastern Europe or the Soviet Union
except to criticize the president,'' he said later in an interview
with several reporters. He said Bush has been properly cautious,
but nevertheless ``out front on this issue.''
   The East German government has opened the Berlin Wall to free
travel and has promised elections.
   ``It's going to take some time. but the reunification of Germany
is eventually inevitable,'' Quayle said. ``Once the East German
communist system goes by the wayside, then there becomes a less
convincing reason why it should remain as a separate country. ...''
   ``That's what keeps it separate. Poland is Poland. Hungary is
Hungary. East Germany is East Germany because of the Communist
system. Do away with the Communist system and it's Germany.''
   Quayle said that reunification would not mean the end of NATO or
the Warsaw Pact but that the western and eastern alliances
certainly would change.
   ``A unified Germany in defense alliances will continue to look
west; it will continue to be allied with the forces of freedom and
democracy, which is the West,'' Quayle said. ``But what the
president wants to see is a Europe, in his words, that's whole and
free.''
   In Washington, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, speaking
before the Democratic Leadership Council, attacked Bush for
timidity and inaction in the face of ``revolutionary times.''
   ``As the walls of the modern Jericho come tumbling down, we have
a president who is inadequate to the moment,'' Gephardt said. ``At
the very time freedom and democracy are receiving standing ovations
in Europe, our president is sitting politely in the audience, with
little to say and even less to contribute.''

<TEXT>
   A man identified as a suspect in the shooting of a
pregnant woman and her husband last month was arraigned Monday on
an unrelated armed robbery charge.
   William Bennett, 39, of Boston's Mission Hill section, where
Carol and Charles Stuart were attacked, pleaded not guilty to
charges he held up a Brookline video store on Oct. 2. He was being
held on $35,000 cash bail at the Norfolk County House of
Corrections.
   Bennett, who has been identified in published reports as a
suspect in the Stuart slaying, was arrested Saturday at his
girlfriend's Burlington home on charges of driving on a revoked
license.
   The motor vehicles case was postponed in a Charlestown court,
where attorney Judith Lindahl appeared in Bennett's defense.
Lindahl said she had been contacted by the Committee for Public
Counsel to defend whomever might be charged in connection with the
Stuart shootings.
   Asked if she thought Bennett might be charged in connection with
those shootings, she said: ``I have no inside knowledge on what the
D.A.'s office will do.'' She had said earlier in the day that if he
is charged ``there is sufficient publicity in the case to deny my
client a fair trial.''
   Bennett's mother, Pauline, told the Boston Herald that her son
was a suspect in the shooting that fatally wounded Mrs. Stuart and
her infant son, Christopher, as well as injuring Charles Stuart.
   Mrs. Stuart, 30, died after she was shot by a man who abducted
her and her husband on Oct. 23 just as they were leaving Brigham
and Womens' Hospital, where they had attended a birthing class.
   Stuart, 29, was listed in stable condition Monday in intensive
care after having surgery Saturday at Boston City Hospital, but
hospital officials would not give a reason for the surgery.
   The infant was delivered by Caesarean section and clung to life
for more than two weeks before succumbing to a respiratory ailment
Thursday. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide.
   In the Brookline courtroom, Crowley granted a motion by attorney
Joel Goodman to let Bennett sit concealed behind the witness stand.
   Goodman said the repeated publication of Bennett's picture could
bias witnesses or potential jurors.
   Bennett's presence in the Charlestown court had been waived
because of the publicity surrounding his arrest.

   A federal panel moved the Seabrook, N.H.,
nuclear power plant a step closer to opening by announcing Monday
it has approved evacuation plans for neighboring Massachusetts
communities.
   The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board had been told by opponents
of the plant that evacuating the densely populated coastal region _
particularly during busy summer months _ would be impossible in a
nuclear emergency.
   In a 571-page decision, the three-member board also approved an
evacuation exercise conducted last year in Massachusetts and New
Hampshire, saying it ``was adequate in scope and revealed no
fundamental flaw.''
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon within hours filed
a motion with the board's appeal panel to overturn the ruling.
   ``If the decision of the licensing board is allowed to stand,
and I don't think it can stand, then it would put at ristk the
safety of hundreds of thousands of citizens who live in
Massachusetts and New Hampshire,'' said Shannon.
   But the $6.3 billion reactor could still receive a full-power
license even before the appeals run their course, said Nuclear
Regulatory Commission spokesman John Kopeck. Seabrook officials
have said they expect the plant to be licensed around the first of
next year.
   ``This is a major development that brings Seabrook closer to a
full-power license,'' said plant spokesman Ron Sher. ``The
emergency plans for Seabrook have been evaluated by the experts _
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the staff of the NRC and
the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards _ and their
conclusions are that Seabrook's emergency plans are among the best
in the country.''
   Seabrook was originally planned to cost less than $1 billion and
begin operation in 1979. The plant has been plagued with repeated
delays due to financing problems faced by its principal owner _
Public Service Company of New Hampshire _ protests mounted by
neighbors of the plant, regulatory changes brought about by the
1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident, and the opposition of
Massachusetts officials.
   In the licensing board's ruling, dated Nov. 9 and made public
Monday, the board found ``reasonable assurance that adequate
protective measures can and will be taken in the event of a
radiological emergency at the Seabrook station, in accordance with
the commission's emergency planning regulations and precedents.
...''
   The licensing board cleared away another potential obstacle to a
full-power license by ruling that a recent appeal board decision on
the New Hampshire evacuation plans posed no major problem in the
licensing process.
   Several flaws in the New Hampshire plans found by the appeal
board in a ruling last week, ``do not preclude the immediate
issuance of an operating license for the Seabrook station,'' the
board said.
   The next step in the complex process involves a 30-day review
period by the NRC, a public meeting held by the full commission at
which the NRC staff makes its recommendations on the plant and a
final decision on issuing a license by the commission.
   Shannon, who was in Washington for an attorneys general
conference, was joined in front of the Capitol building by
Massachusetts Sens. John Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy.
   Kennedy called the licensing board ruling, ``Perhaps the most
irrespoinsible action that I have seen taken by any administrative
agency in the 28 years that I have been in the United States
Senate.'' He called for a congressional investigation into the
process that led to Monday's announcement. Kerry called the
decision ``abusive'' and ``arrogant.''

<TEXT>
   The ruling Politburo restored Communist
Party membership to 11 advocates of reform Monday, and sources who
follow Bulgarian politics predicted a purge of top party ranks
within weeks.
   The sources, Bulgarians and diplomats, said a housecleaning also
was expected in the top levels of government as a result of the
removal Friday of Todor Zhivkov, 78, who led the party with rigid
orthodoxy for 35 years.
   He was succeeded by Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov, 53, who
served 18 years as foreign minister and is considered more open to
reform.
   Parliament is to meet Wednesday to choose a new president to
replace Zhivkov and the party Central Committee is expected to
order other personnel changes soon.
   BTA, the official news agency, said most of the activists whose
party memberships were restored were members of the Independent
Club for the Support of Glasnost and Perestroika, which
incorporates Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Russian
catchwords for change.
   The Politburo also proposed that those who lost their jobs as a
result of unorthodox views be reinstated.
   Among those taken back into the party were Ivan Dzhadzhev and
Koprinka Chervenkova, the club's chairman and spokeswoman
respectively.
   Dzhadzhev, a professor of esthetics at the Higher Institute of
Theatrical Art in Sofia, said in an interview Sunday the group was
thriving despite intimidation and repression.
   He said its ``unifying aim'' was ``democratization of our
society'' and predicted that within five years, ``the political
landscape in Bulgaria will be totally different from what it is
now. ... Political pluralism will become a reality.''
   Also Monday, the Supreme Court said the Sofia city court must
reconsider the application for legal status of another independent
group, Eco-Glasnost, because it made procedural mistakes the first
time.
   Representatives of the environmental group said the decision
improved the chances of official approval. No date was announced
for the new hearing.
   One Bulgarian source described Mladenov as a well-connected
politician with good relations in Moscow, where he was educated.
   Mladenov stopped in Moscow on his way home from a recent trip to
China, but sources discounted rumours that Zhivkov was ousted at
Gorbachev's behest.
   A BTA dispatch Monday said Mladenov had spoken with Gorbachev by
telephone since becoming party chief and they pledged to strengthen
cooperation.
   According to the sources, Zhivkov's fate was decided at a secret
meeting of the 10-member Politburo on Nov. 9, the day before the
Central Committee announced his resignation.
   It had been rumored for years that Zhivkov was on the way out.
The sources, both Bulgarians and diplomats, said resistance to his
departure came from the men around him rather than the leader
himself.
   Bulgarian sources confirmed rumors circulating among diplomats
before Friday that Mladenov had offered to resign as foreign
minister earlier this month.
   They said he made the offer a few days before he was to lead a
Bulgarian delegation in talks with Turkish officials about the
dispute over 1.5 million ethnic Turks in Bulgaria. Zhivkov named
Deputy Premier Georgi Yardanov to head the delegation.
   One reason Mladenov wanted to resign was that hard-liners
criticized his successful efforts to have a 35-nation environmental
conference held in Sofia, the sources said.
   The conference gave several new Bulgarian reform groups their
first opportunity to express their views publicly. They held
rallies and news conferences to explain their objectives to
diplomats and journalists.
   Mladenov is said to have disagreed with methods the government
used to ``Bulgarize'' the ethnic Turkish minority.
   In Washington, the State Department disclosed Monday that
Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with him in September at
the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said their talks focused primarily on the flight of ethnic
Turks from Bulgaria.
   About 320,000 Bulgarian Turks fled religious and cultural
discrimination in Bulgaria, but nearly 60,000 have returned because
they could not find jobs or housing.
   ``Mladenov was ... against the methods'' applied to the ethnic
Turks, including the use of security forces in 1984-85 to force
them to take Bulgarian names, one source reported.
   Opinions differ about whether, or at what pace, Mladenov will
bring political or economic change.
   A Western diplomat said he ``has not been known to us as a
reformer,'' but Bulgarian sources said Mladenov was expected to
move cautiously in that direction.

<HEAD>Proposed Network Would Like Students, Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students hoping to impress would-be bosses
with their straight A grades would be helped along under an
ambitious new plan to use computers to link young job-seekers with
potential employers.
   It is called the Incentive to Learn Project and its backers are
no less than American businesses eager to get qualified workers
with basic skills and a good track record.
   ``The need for this is to set up a framework whereby employers
and work-bound students can communicate more effectively,'' said
Barry Rogstead, president of the American Business Conference.
   ABC, together with the National Alliance of Business and
Educational Testing Service, plans to set up a computerized
information system that will record a student's achievements and
make the record available to potential employers.
   They call it a ``training and experience information system.''
   Beginning in the sixth or seventh grade, Rogstead said, ``the
student works on building a file which contains that student's
employment history, any summer jobs, course transcripts, evaluation
and some testing. It will be much more a performance assessment
than just simple percentile rankings on an achievement test.''
   Rogstead said the idea will be tested in five to 25 labor
markets in the next two to three years.
   ``It will be an opportunity for students who never before were
able to get into an employer network, to get into the game in an
organized way,'' he said. ``There is no question that the business
community will have to channel in some seed money.''
   The idea was broached at the National Governor's Conference last
July by the American Business Conference.
   ``Companies are the largest customers of what the school
supplies: educated graduates,'' said a statement issued by the ABC.
   ``In the past, companies were fairly indifferent shoppers. That
must change. The workforce is shrinking at just the time that
demand for literate and arithmetically adept employees is
expanding. Firms have no choice but to demand greater quality from
the schools.''
   Rogstead said a problem of the past has been that business has
not articulated well what it requires from students and that at
those times when information was asked from schools, it was not
always forthcoming.
   ``There is a lack of communication from both sides,'' he said,
asking rhetorically: ``Are we giving the student a very concrete
sense that if he attempts to do better in school and take tougher
courses, anybody out there in the business world is going to take
time to notice?
   ``Can we ask why students are not motivated if we don't
differentiate one high school diploma from another?''
   The information system will be called Worklink.
   A brochure says that students would compile their records at
their own pace and these records would be readily accessed by
employers. The student could order a copy of his or her record to
be sent to specific employers, agencies, or training institutions.
   ``The individual would control his or her Worklink record; only
attainment, not failure, would be recorded,'' the brochure sys
``Worklink records, begun in high school, could serve persons
throughout their working careers with continued updates at a number
of agencies in the community ... A person's Worklink record would
eventually be usable throughout the U.S.''

   Eight inmates wielding iron clubs

   Negotiations were being conducted with the prisoners and 300
heavily armed policeman had cordoned off the building, said Rubens

miles southwest of Rio.
   Buelo said the hostages, all employees of the Central Prison of

psychologists. He said the 40 were taken hostage in the cafeteria
during the lunch hour.
   The prisoners were demanding more weapons and an armored car for

   ``We're sure negotiations will be successful,'' Buelo said.
``We're doing our best to keep everyone calm and confort the

   Windy storms dumped locally heavy rain over parts of Texas on
Monday, and unseasonably warm air boosted temperatures to record
highs from Iowa to Georgia.
   Thunderstorms produced up to 1{ inches of rain and wind gusting
to 45 mph during the morning over the Hill Country and Edwards
Plateau of south-central Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued over parts of the area
during the afternoon and also spread over southern Louisiana.
   In the Northwest, a cold front produced showers over western
Washington state and northwestern Oregon. Rain and snow showers
developed along a stationary front curving through western Montana
and northwestern Wyoming.
   Unseasonably warm weather continued south and east of a cold
front crossing the central Plains and middle Mississippi Valley.
   Record highs were 81 at Beaufort, S.C.; 67 at Buffalo, N.Y.; 77
at Cape Hatteras, N.C., a tie; 70 at Cedar Rapids, Iowa; 82 at

<HEAD>Aviation Breakthrough _ Human Muscle Powers Helicopter Into Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A human-powered helicopter has
made its first flight with a bicycle racer's leg muscles spinning
the craft's 100-foot rotor blade.
   Videotape was used to verify that it lifted several inches off
the ground for several seconds Sunday inside a gymnasium, Bob
Anderson, a spokesman for California State Polytechnic University,
San Luis Obispo, said Monday.
   No previous human-powered helicopter has ever gotten off the
ground, even though the idea for such a craft dates back nearly 500
years to the sketches of Leonardo Da Vinci, said Chris Colligan
with the American Helicopter Society in Alexandria, Va.
   The 100-pound copter, known as the Da Vinci III, hovered inches
above the floor under the pedaling power of cyclist Greg McNeil, a
Cal Poly aeronautical engineering major who races on the U.S.
cycling team.
   The Da Vinci III is the fourth helicopter to be built by
students since 1981, when the project was first attempted. The last
version, the Da Vinci IIb, was damaged in May.
   Students began preparing the helicopter for its flight Saturday
night, making subtle adjustments necessary for a stable flight,
said David Calta, 22, president of the local student chapter of the
American Helicopter Society.
   The craft, made mostly of composite materials and plastic,
finally took to the air at around 7 a.m. Sunday.
   ``We don't know what time it was exactly. It was so exciting
that nobody bothered to look at their watches,'' said Anderson.
   Neal Saiki, 23, a Cal Poly senior who has worked on the project
for more than two years, said three specific improvements
contributed to the success of the latest model.
   ``We made it lighter, we made the rotors straighter and we got a
pilot with a better output,'' Saiki said.
   The next step, the students said, will be to fly the helicopter
for officials of the American Helicopter Society, who must witness
a flight before the Da Vinci III formally becomes a part of
aviation history.
   After that, the students said, they'll call the Guinness Book of
World Records.
   Don't look for a home version, Saiki said.
   ``It's far too big to ever be popular,'' he said. ``I mean, it
fills up the gym practically wall to wall.''

   East German legislators elected a reform-oriented
premier and discussed the idea of free elections Monday during a
frank debate that departed abruptly from Parliament's usual
rubber-stamp role.
   The new premier, Hans Modrow, likely will wield more clout than
his predecessor, Willi Stoph, who resigned last week. He is
expected to initiate a measure of political democracy and to
address growing economic problems.
   In an unusual development, Stoph, an unquestioning follower of
ousted Communist leader Erich Honecker since he assumed the
premiership in 1964, accused Honecker and other former ranking
Communists of misusing their powers.
   Stoph also acknowledged his government had erred in not
consulting with Parliament on major decisions, the state news
agency ADN said.
   Only one of 477 deputies present at the 500-seat Parliament
meeting voted against Modrow, an indication of the chamber's
support for reforms.
   The session was carried in full on state television.
   Modrow, 61, the former Communist party chief in Dresden, is
considered by many to be East Germany's answer to Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Central authorities singled him out in June for rare public
criticism, saying he failed to control ``bourgeois and enemy
views'' in Dresden after an early demonstration of citizens
demanding free travel to the West.
   Much of Monday's debate in the legislature was dominated by
normally docile non-Communist deputies, who criticized the
leadership for restricting their role.
   ``We expect that the constitutional rights of Parliament (will)
be strictly observed in the future, so that our Parliament will
never again be discredited,'' declared Michael Koplanski of the
Liberal Party.
   Parliament also picked a non-Communist speaker in the chamber's
first secret ballot and urged accelerated changes.
   Previously there has been only one candidate for the post of
speaker, and the candidate usually has been approved unanimously.
   Of those present, 246 deputies voted for Guenther Maleuda in the
second round, while his closest rival, Manfred Gerlach, gathered
230 votes.
   Maleuda is head of the Democratic Peasant Party of Germany, one
of four non-Communist parties that have been allowed to exist in
exchange for accepting the authority of the Communists.
   Some of the deputies urging free and secret elections were
high-ranking Communists, among them Werner Jarowinsky, a member of
the policy-setting Politburo. He also urged the formation of a
coalition government that would allow the non-Communist parties
more influence.
   ``Political arrogance'' of the previous party and state
leadership cost East German Communists the trust of the people and
plunged the country into its economic and social crisis, Jarowinsky
said.
   He also indirectly criticized the country's record on human
rights, saying international norms must be strictly observed.
   Some deputies, echoing the demands of pro-democracy activists,
also appealed for removal from the constitution of language
declaring the nation a socialist state.

   The House on Monday approved a series of
anti-drug bills giving legal shape to President Bush's war on
narcotics, from the Andean countries where coca is grown to schools
and neighborhoods where it is consumed.
   The legislation provides the authority for a list of programs
carrying out the drug war and putting Congress' imprint on the
initiative Bush announced earlier this year. The government will
spend some $8.8 billion on its anti-drug efforts this year, and the
money itself is provided for in other legislation.
   One of the measures the House passed authorizes $125 million in
military aid in fiscal 1990 for Colombia, Peru and Bolivia to train
and equip anti-narcotics forces in their law enforcement,
interdiction and eradication battle. Another $115 million is
authorized for the State Department's international anti-drug
operations.
   ``We cannot let (Colombian President Virgilio) Barco, and the
people of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia twist in the wind until next
year,'' said Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa., arguing for quick
action on the bill.
   Addressing a major congressional concern, the bill specifically
bars U.S. military and drug-enforcement personnel from directly
participating in anti-drug field operations including arrests. But
American officials could be present during those operations, and
act to protect themselves in an emergency.
   Other provisions waive a ban on U.S. foreign aid to countries
that are behind in their repayment of U.S. government debt, such as
Peru and Bolivia, and express Congress' desire that the aid be
followed later with economic aid to coca farmers to entice them to
grow alternative crops.
   In separate legislation, the House also:
   _Separated the $1.2 billion Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental
Health block grant program into two parts, one for substance abuse
and one for mental health. Under the mental health grants, a new
program would provide $100 million to help rural communities
provide drug treatment. Another $75 million would be earmarked for
drug programs for pregnant women and their infants.
   _Directed most of the increased money for this year for the
Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act to local school districts and
disadvantaged areas. Some $500 million is expected to be spent
under the drug education program this year, about $180 million more
than in the year that ended Sept. 30.
   _Extended for four years the authority for the Justice
Department to transfer money from seized drug assets to the Office
of National Drug Control Policy.
   The legislation still must be approved by the Senate.

   Sylvester Stewart, better known as rock
musician Sly Stone of Sly and the Family Stone, was ordered held
without bond Monday pending extradition to California, where he is
wanted on a 1987 drug charge.
   Stone was arrested by FBI agents Saturday in Wilton on a federal
charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, said Special Agent
Virginia Wright of the FBI's New Haven office.
   Stone was ordered by U.S. District Judge Warren W. Eginton to be
held without bond for three days, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ted
Heinrich. Within that time, Heinrich said he expected California
authorities to initiate extradition proceedings. When that happens,
the unlawful flight charge will be dropped, Heinrich said.
   The 45-year-old musician was arrested in April 1987 on state
narcotics charges in Los Angeles. When he failed to appear in
court, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest in July 1988,
Wright said.
   Since he fled California Stone has been living in Connecticut
and New Jersey and used the alias, Sylvester Allen. He has
relatives in Wilton and Newark, Wright said.
   Sly and the Family Stone had a string of hits in the late 1960s
and early 1970s, including ``Stand,'' ``Everyday People,'' ``Thank
You'' and ``I Want to Take You Higher.'' Stone has not had a song
on the charts since 1974.

<TEXT>
   A recount of the votes in Yonkers' mayoral
election was completed Monday and confirmed the election of
Republican Henry Spallone, a vigorous opponent of the city's
court-ordered desegregation plan.
   Spallone had been proclaimed mayor on Election Night, ousting
Nicholas Wasicsko by 4,466 votes. But in the first stage of the
recount, Wasicsko suddenly picked up nearly 1,700 votes, and an
election commissioner said the result could be reversed.
   But on Monday, the final, unofficial tally showed Spallone with
29,294 for Spallone and 25,021 for Wasicsko, a Democrat who had
urged compliance with the desegregation plan, according to
Elections Commissioner Antonia D'Apice.
   That left Spallone ahead by 4,273 votes.
   ``That's the ball game,'' Wasicsko said.
   About 1,300 absentee and affidavit ballots remain, but Wasicsko
``can't overcome the difference,'' said D'Apice.
   The key issue in the race was the city's housing desegregation
order. Spallone has been its most vocal opponent and Wasicsko its
most aggressive supporter.
   The makeup of the City Council and its approach to the
desegregation order was also affected by the outcome of the mayoral
race. The council, without the mayor, was evenly split with three
people supporting the plan and three against it.

   The House approved a bill Monday to transfer a
priceless collection of Indian artifacts from New York's Museum of
the American Indian to the Smithsonian Institution for display in
museums in Washington and New York.
   The measure may at long last make peace among politicians,
native Americans and archaeologists, first by resolving a
10-year-old dispute in New York over how to display and preserve
the Heye Foundation collection of more than a million Indian
artifacts.
   Second, it stipulates that the Smithsonian Institution, where
possible, return its collection of some 18,000 Indian remains to
their original tribes for burial.
   The question of the remains had been the last obstacle to
crafting a passable bill, and compromise came in September, when
Smithsonian Secretary Robert McCormick Adams reversed the museum's
long-held policy that the bones were necessary for study. Indians
nationwide, seeking to bury their ancestors, heralded his decision
as a watershed that will influence other museums.
   The House passed the measure on a voice vote. A similar bill
passed the Senate on Oct. 3., but because of slight differences in
the two bills' language, Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, planned
to ask the Senate to approve the House version Tuesday, said Inouye
spokeswoman Pat Zell.
   ``Sen. Inouye has asked for the consent of the Senate to bring
up the bill as amended and have the Senate approve that bill and
send it directly to the White House,'' Zell said Monday.
   Suzan Shown Harjo, a trustee of the Museum of the American
Indian, was confident that the Senate would go along with the plan.
   The bill passed Monday would establish a Museum of the American
Indian in the last available space on the Washington Mall, between
the National Air and Space Museum and the Capitol. There the
Smithsonian would erect an 82,500 square foot building financed
two-thirds with private donations and one-third with public money.
   The bill further states that a satellite museum, the George
Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian,
would be established in the old U.S. Custom House in lower
Manhattan. Both New York state and New York City have pledged to
contribute up to $8 million apiece toward converting the building
for that use. The federal government would chip in another $8
million under the bill.

   Estonian legislators issued their boldest
challenge to the Kremlin by annulling the Baltic republic's 1940
decision to join the Soviet Union, but did not actually vote to
secede, Tass reported Monday.
   The official news ageny said the legislature passed a resolution
Sunday accusing the Soviet Union of ``aggression, military
occupation and annexation of the Estonian republic'' and declaring
the vote in 1940 ``unlawful.''
   Legislatures of the Baltic republics _ Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania _ already have condemned the Soviet-German agreement of
1939 that gave free rein to Hitler in Poland and to Stalin in the
Baltics. The Soviet Union absorbed the Baltic republics the next
year.
   Soviet historians maintain the Baltic states joined the Soviet
Union for protection against Hitler. Western historians and Baltic
activists say the unions were forced.
   A special commission of the national parliament, led by
Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, is reviewing the status of
the Baltic republics.
   The Estonian resolution passed Sunday specified that it did not
invoke Article 69 of the republic's constitution, which says
Estonia ``retains the right to freely leave the U.S.S.R.''
   Both the text and a top official of the Estonian Communist Party
said the resolution would be the basis, instead, for negotiating
greater independence within the Soviet framework.
   Estonia has led the Baltic states in legal and legislative
challenges to Kremlin authority. Its supreme court has asserted
Estonia's right to refuse national laws, and Estonians have been
most vocal in demanding more autonomy.
   Tass said the latest resolution caused stormy debate Sunday in
the Estonian legislature, and that 46 deputies walked out at one
point to protest the refusal to postpone the vote.
   Miik Tiitma, a ranking official of the Estonian party,
emphasized that the republic did not intend to secede, but that the
resolution would ``change relations between the republic and the
center,'' the agency said.
   Tiitma said the lawmakers understood the importance of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program, and would not to take
extreme steps that might jeopardize it and do ``irreparable damage
to the process of expanding the political and economic sovereignty
of the Baltic peoples,'' Tass reported.
   The resolution said Estonia would use it in negotiations ``on
the relations in the Soviet Union and in the world society of
sovereign Soviet states.''
   It also directed the legislature's Presidium to review laws
passed in 1940 ``under the pressure of a representative of the
Stalinist regime.''
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, printed a long list Monday
of Estonian laws that conflict with the national constitution, and
repeated a request from the national Supreme Soviet Presidium that
they be brought into line.
   On Monday, the national Supreme Soviet voted to put the question
of ``constitutional compliance'' on the agenda for the next
Congress of People's Deputies, scheduled for Dec. 12.
   Estonia has refused previous requests to modify its laws.

   The head of the city's police union vowed Monday
to continue to fight against random drug tests after the U.S.
Supreme Court let stand a ruling that forces officers to undergo
the tests.
   The nation's highest court, without comment, left intact a
ruling that the tests do not violate the police officers' privacy
even when there is no reason to suspect drug abuse.
   ``There are different legal avenues that we can follow. One is
to take the rule right back into the state courts and challenge the
constitutionality,'' said Robert Guiney, president of the Boston
Police Patrolmen's Association.
   Drug testing should be used only when there is probable or
reasonable cause to suspect an officer's drug use, he said.
   ``I'm very disappointed. I'm disappointed in the fact the
Supreme Court has said that police officers in this city and in
this country have different Constitutional rights than other
citizens,'' said Guiney, who has led the fight against random tests
for three years.
   Fighting testing in court, he said, ``might be an opportunity to
sit down and do some bargaining over this, which is originally
where we were when this thing started.''
   Boston Police officials say the tests are needed to assure
public confidence and to prevent officers from becoming susceptible
to bribery because of a drug habit.
   ``Over time I believe that this procedure will enhance the
health and safety for dedicated professionals of whom society
expects so much, in terms of the dangers they face and the risks
they undertake to protect the public safety,'' Police Commissioner
Francis Roache said in a statement Monday.
   In its first drug-testing rulings in March, the Supreme Court
upheld drug and alcohol tests for railway workers involved in
accidents and U.S. Customs Service employees applying for
drug-enforcement jobs or those positions that require carrying a
firearm.
   Neither ruling directly addressed the question of random tests.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals nevertheless relied on
those decisions in May in upholding the constitutionality of random
urinalysis tests for Boston police officers who carry firearms or
enforce drug laws.
   The appeals court overturned a decision by U.S. District Judge
Robert E. Keeton that the tests violate the officers' rights.
   ``Since we can find no relevant distinction between a customs
officer and a police officer, we hold the police department's
drug-testing rule to be constitutional,'' the Appeals Court said.

   East Germany's Parliament elected a leading
reformer as the new premier Monday night, but hundreds of thousands
of protesters took to the streets of Leipzig to say Communist
reforms are moving too slowly.
   After a historic weekend in which millions of East Germans took
advantage of their new freedom to travel west, Parliament also
picked a non-Communist speaker in the chamber's first secret ballot
and urged accelerated changes.
   And the government said it was dismantling internal barriers
that for three decades formed a notorious ``death strip'' between
the Berlin Wall and the city's sealed-off eastern sector.
   Deputies appealed for truly free elections, a coalition
government and removal from the constitution of language declaring
their nation a socialist state.
   The parliament, known as the People's Chamber, then approved the
Communist Party's nomination of Politburo member Hans Modrow to
lead a new government as premier. The government traditionally has
been subservient to the party.
   Modrow is a well-known reformer within the party, which has been
led by Egon Krenz since Oct. 18. Krenz has promised some reforms,
including free elections.
   As deputies argued into the night in East Berlin, pro-democracy
activists in Leipzig, in the center of the country, pressed for
continued change to prolong the spirit of hope sweeping the nation.
   ``Open borders by themselves cannot be the only freedom,''
warned a banner carried by some in the crowd.
   West German television estimated the number of protesters at
200,000 to 300,000.
   The protesters urged the government to live up to its promise of
free elections and questioned the commitment of the new leadership.
   ``The question is, are you (the new government) really different
from the others?'' one speaker said at the rally.
   In the northern city of Schwerin, another 10,000 people staged a
pro-democracy rally.
   At the session to approve Modrow, the first secret balloting in
the Communist-dominated Parliament elected a new speaker, Guenther
Maleuda, who told the assembly it was duty-bound to heed the calls
of the reform movement.
   Maleuda, 58, is the chairman of the Democratic Peasants Party,
one of the four small parties allied with the ruling Communists.
The Communist Party did not propose a candidate for the post.
   In addition to the parliamentary session, the party's 163-member
Central Committee set Dec. 15 for an emergency party congress that
will elect a new leadership and rewrite its political platform.
   The party, which has had a monopoly on power in the 40 years
since East Germany was created, is struggling to meet the pent-up
demands of about 16 million citizens who have watched their
Communist neighbors restore democracy while they were denied the
same freedoms.
   Modrow is an anti-establishment Communist who enjoys broad
popular support. He was nominated to replace Willi Stoph, who
resigned last week along with his entire 44-member cabinet.
   About 100,000 more East Germans crossed into West Berlin and
West Germany on Monday, but the arrivals were a trickle compared
with the wave of 3 million visitors that went west over the weekend
after travel restrictions were lifted.
   The East German news agency ADN said more than 5 million visas
had been issued since Thursday, and that only about 10,000 asked
for emigration papers. They seek to join more than 200,000 who have
resettled in West Germany this year.
   Fewer than 1 percent of the weekend visitors stayed behind. Most
people returned to their jobs and homes in East Germany.
   ``I really don't know whether I should be happy or pensive,''
said Michael Werner, an East Berliner who made his first trip to
the West this weekend.
   Some returned bitter over the contrast between the overflowing
store shelves seen in the West and the barren ones at home.
   ``This is what socialism looks like!'' an East Berlin man
exclaimed after standing in line for oranges and being told they
had run out. ``We still have a long way to go, despite the
weekend.''
   In West Berlin, where the weekend bash had thousands dancing on
the wall and chipping out souvenirs from the doomed Cold War
symbol, street crews swept up seas of broken glass, crumpled paper,
lost gloves and other debris.
   On the other side, the East German government said it was
dismantling the ``death strip'' that rings the wall around the city
and runs along the 854-mile border with West Germany. It ranges in
width from 70 feet to three miles and was the scene of 191 deaths
since 1961, when the Berlin Wall was built.
   ADN, the official news agency, said the zone would be
dismantled, but did not say when the barriers would be removed or
what would happen to the freed property running through the densely
populated city center.
   White House officials hailed the ``glorious'' traffic of East
Germans streaming west but said financial assistance would have to
await further reforms.
   Vice President Dan Quayle said reunification with West Germany
was inevitable.
   ``East Germany is East Germany because of the Communist
system,'' Quayle said at Hilton Head Island, S.C. ``Do away with
the Communist system and it's Germany.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker on Monday
said Soviet action in Central America and Cuba ``has been the
biggest obstacle'' to that country's achieving better relations
with the United States.
   Baker blamed the Soviet Union for aiding El Salvadoran
guerrillas in their bloody offensive.
   ``The Soviet Union bears a special responsibility because its
arms and money, moving through Cuba and Nicaragua, continue to
support violence, destruction and war,'' Baker said in an address
before the Organization of American States. ``Shipments of soviet
rocket-propelled grenades to the FMLN are incompatible with the new
thinking.''
   He added, ``Soviet behavior toward Cuba and Central America
remains the biggest obstacle to a full across the board imporvement
in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.''
   Baker joined other administration officials in condeming what he
called ``acts of terror'' by the leftist Salvadoran guerrillas,
known as the FMLN. Hundreds of people have been killed in the small
Central American nation in the fighting that began over the weekend.
   ``It's a very difficult situation with this very large and
organized and clearly calculated offensive under way,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. ``And while it is being handled,
it certainly represents an escalation of the attacks from anything
we've seen in recent months.''
   ``The president stands with the freely-elected government of El
Salvador in condemning this senseless violence,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said El Salvador's president, Alfredo Cristiani, had
not asked for assistance to quell the fighting, the heaviest since
a 1981 offensive by the Marxist-led rebels. He said he would not
rule out U.S. involvement, adding: ``We can never predict the
future. But at this point, it's not anticipated.''
   The United States provides El Salvador with about $1.5 million a
day in economic and military aid. Fifty-five American military
advisers are assigned to train the Salvadoran troops but are not
supposed to take part in field operations.
   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said
Christopher Babcock of Spokane, Wash., was killed Sunday when he
was hit in the head by a grenade fragment. He was a teacher at the
American School in San Salvador, the capital.
   Fitzwater cited reports of recent arms shipments to the rebels
from the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, adding: ``The latest
attacks show that much more of the Sandinista arms designed to
destabilize and overthrow the legitimate government of El Salvador
have been getting through.''
   At the Organization of American States, Nicaraguan Foreign
Minister Miguel D'Escoto introduced a resolution Monday calling for
an urgent appeal to the Salvadoran government ``to cease
immediately the bombing of the civilian population'' and other acts
of repression.
   The rebels launched the offensive Sunday after pulling out of
peace talks to protest a series of attacks on leftist political and
union leaders, which they blamed on the U.S.-backed government.
Cristiani, whose official residence was attacked, declared a state
of siege, rescinding basic civil liberties and imposing a 6 p.m. to
6 a.m. curfew nationwide.
   Boucher defended the move, saying: ``The imposition of a state
of siege of limited duration by the government, we believe, is a
responsible measure to protect civilians from the FMLN's (Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front) latest campaign of terror.''
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., the chairman of the foreign
operations subcommittee, said Cristiani's rightist government
should move with caution.
   ``They should be very careful that they not fall back into the
patterns that held the government in disrepute in the first
place,'' he said, adding that his criticizm of the administration's
handling of El Salvador has been justified.
   ``I have been critical of the administration for giving an all's
well attitude down there,'' Leahy said. ``And in view of the events
this weekend, it's not.''
   Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif., said the guerrilla offensive
showed the rebels ``are obviously desperate'' and defended
Cristiani's suspension of civil rights by saying: ``I think we'd do
exactly the same thing if rebels were attacking Washington, D.C.''
   The spokesman said about 1,500 guerrillas infiltrated into San
Salvador for the attack and that fighting in the capital caused
significant civilian casualties. There have been attacks in other
cities and on armed forces brigade headquarters in outlying
provinces.
   Boucher said there were ``indications in the past that something
like this might happen.''
   U.S. Embassy personell and their dependants were staying close
to home, he said. The American School was closed. The Pentagon
declined to comment on whether the military advisers assigned to
outlying bases had been recalled to the capital.

   South Carolina Gov. Carroll A.
Cambell Jr. praised the Bush administration on Monday for the way
it responded to the disaster of Hurricane Hugo, saying ``they did a
wonderful job.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle responded by praising Campbell for the
way he handled the disaster. ``You were truly an inspiration to all
of us,'' Quayle said.
   The exchange of compliments for a performance sharply criticized
by some Democrats came as Quayle addressed the Republican Governors
Conference.
   Campbell said the administration authorized disaster relief
expenditures for the southeast in a matter of hours, acting even
more rapidly than in the aftermath of the California earthquake.
   He also thanked other state governors for offering hurricane
assistance, saying that 20 of them had done so.
   ``The damage was over double, almost three times, what it was in
California,'' said Campbell, who has been using the conference
forum to declare that the state already is making its comeback from
the disaster.

   The West Coast is suffering an extended
epidemic of Hepatitis A, a virulent liver disease with flu-like
symptoms that has struck thousands this year.
   Health officials blame the disease's spread partly on
intravenous drug users and the fact that hepatitis can occur
undetected in young children.
   Although a Hepatitis A vaccine has been developed, it may be six
years or more before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves
its use.
   Through Oct. 28, 1,951 Hepatitis A cases were reported in
Oregon, 2,613 in Washington, 5,635 in California and 2,032 in
Arizona, according to Dr. Gary Schatz, hepatitis control officer
for the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Nationwide, 27,869
cases were reported during the same 10-month period.
   ``The West Coast is very high,'' said Dr. Harold Osterud,
chairman of the Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine
at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. ``We're not at
all sure why that is true. Certainly the number of cases in the
Midwest and the East seem to be remarkably lower.''
   For example, Oregon, with a population of 2.7 million, has
recorded far more cases than larger states such as Virginia, with a
population of 5.9 million and only 255 cases, or Minnesota, with a
population of 2.4 million and only 139 cases.
   The disease spreads through fecal-oral transmission. ``It's from
using the toilet and not washing your hands,'' Oregon Health
Division spokesman Art Keil explained.
   The illness is marked by fatigue, flu-like symptoms, nausea and
vomiting, and pain in the liver, on the right upper side of the
abdomen.
   ``That's where it does its damage,'' Osterud said. ``If the
liver is involved, most older people will become jaundiced. Young
children and up through the teen-ager and so forth frequently don't
become jaundiced.''
   Schatz said one-half of 1 percent of Hepatitis A victims die,
all of them adults and many of them pregnant women.
   Prevention focuses mainly on promoting sanitary toilet habits,
but once the virus is introduced into a community, its spread is
difficult to control, doctors say.
   The disease often passes unnoticed in children, making their
family members and care providers likely victims. Day care centers,
where healthy and infected children may play together, provide a
prime setting for spreading the disease.
   ``With diaper-age kids, people are used to seeing them with
diarrhea anyway and you don't chalk it up to anything worth
worrying about,'' Schatz said. ``And they're rarely ill for any
length of time.''
   Oregon statistics show the most cases are reported among adults
under the age of 40. While they may be infected by others in their
household, the primary carriers among adults appear to be
intravenous needle users and food handlers, Keil said.
   Needle use is very high on the West Coast, especially among
methamphetamine users, according to Lt. Bob Miller, narcotic unit
commander for the Oregon State Police.
   However, while there also are a large number of intravenous drug
users in New York, that state reported just 344 cases of Hepatitis
A through Oct. 28, Schatz said.
   Once contracted, the virus simply runs its course, unless the
patient is aware of having been exposed before the symptoms occur
15 to 30 days later, Osterud said.
   Immune globulin can be injected within two weeks of exposure,
and will protect against the illness or at least make it less
severe. Although a vaccine has been developed by SmithKline
Beecham, an international pharmaceutical company, it has just begun
to be tested in the United States.
   ``It is still early in clinical trials, which run for three to
six years,'' spokeswoman Sharon Arnold said by telephone from
Philadelphia, where the company's Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories
are located.
   Until the vaccine is available, the disease will continue to
spread, Schatz said.

   An elections official said Monday her staff
will check returns ``with a fine-tooth comb'' before certifying the
result of the tight governor's race, which apparently was won by
Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder.
   Susan Fitz-Hugh, secretary of the electoral board, said the
state's 136 localities have finished their official canvass of the
Nov. 7 balloting for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney
general, the House of Delegates and local offices and referendums.
   Wilder, a Democrat who would be the nation's first elected black
governor, leads Republican J. Marshall Coleman, a former attorney
general, by a few thousand votes.
   A canvass of all local registrars Monday to obtain final figures
showed Wilder with 897,125 votes to 890,273 for Coleman, a margin
of 6,852 out of 1.78 million votes cast. Results from three
counties had not been verified.
   Coleman has said he will ask for a recount if Wilder's lead of
less than half a percent holds up.
   Ms. Fitz-Hugh said state law requires that the election results
be certified on the fourth Monday of November, which is Nov. 27.
She said her office needs the two weeks to recheck the results from
each locality.
   ``We go through the election precinct by precinct. We
computerize the figures,'' she said. ``If we find a problem, we
then have to call the locality, walk through the whole processs
with them to find out where the error is and get them to change
their figures if necessary.''
   Checking balloting will be no more painstaking than it would be
if one candidate won in a landslide, Ms. Fitz-Hugh said. ``We go
through it with a fine-tooth comb anyway.''
   If the state finds a problem that occurred on Election Night,
the officers of the election for that precinct are called in, Ms.
Fitz-Hugh said.
   ``We usually have at least 50 that have to be contacted and
officers called in,'' she said.

   The top local prosecutors for Chicago and Los
Angeles forged an information link Monday in the fight against
drugs, a connection they want to expand into a national network of
prosecutors against crime.
   State boundaries are artificial ``when you're dealing with
narcotics,'' said Ira Reiner, the Los Angeles County district
attorney.
   ``Gangs and other large drug dealers are becoming multistate
enterprises,'' said Cook County State's Attorney Cecil A. Partee.
   The two appeared at a news conference where Reiner said Los
Angeles has become cocaine's number one point of entry in the
United States.
   ``And the cocaine that is sold on the streets here, in Chicago,
begins at one point in Los Angeles,'' Reiner said.
   ``So it makes a great deal of sense that Los Angeles and Cook
County come together as the first two offices in what State's
Attorney Partee envisions as a national network of urban
prosecutors.''
   Partee said he has contacted his counterparts in Miami and New
York about the idea, but has not worked out details with those
offices.
   He also plans to contact Dallas, Houston and Seattle, said a
spokesman for Partee, Dan McCullough.
   ``The recent infusion of crack into our community is believed to
be closely linked to a new alliance between gangs in Chicago and
Los Angeles,'' Partee said.
   Chicago had until recently been free of crack, a highly
addictive derivative of cocaine, authorities say.
   Partee said he and Reiner will soon name liaisons to each
other's offices, who will communicate by telephone.
   Prosecutors from different states have worked together before,
but not extensively, Reiner said.
   ``We will have in Los Angeles the head deputy of our narcotics
unit, the head deputy of our gang unit, in contact with their like
numbers in the Cook County office, where there will be ... a
constant and systematic exchange of information and intelligence,''
Reiner said.
   Before the news conference, Reiner and Partee met with
representatives of the U.S. attorney's office, the Chicago Police
Department, and with community leaders to discuss cooperation in
the drug war.
   The Cook County and Los Angeles County prosecutors began working
together after members of a Los Angeles street gang, known as the
Crips, came to Chicago in 1987 and killed a parking-garage
attendant.
   Two gang members were convicted of murder and sentenced in
recent weeks _ one to 60 years, the other to natural life. A third
defendant will be tried next month.

<HEAD>FAO Director Says Number of Hungry in World Soaring</HEAD>
<UNK>By TERRY LEONARD ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of hungry people in the world is steadily
rising because of the population growth, environmental problems and
economic crisis, the director-general of the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization said Monday.
   Eduoard Saouma told delegates to the FAO's 25th biennial
conference that the agency conservatively estimates there are 500
million undernourished people in the world. He did not give
previous estimates.
   He also said the world's population increased by 178 million the
last two years and 90 percent of the births were in Third World
countries, ``the poorest and least-equipped to cope with this
onslaught.''
   Conference chairman John Kerin of Australia said the world
population is about 5 billion now and is expected to expand to as
much as 7 billion by the year 2000.
   He said the delegates meeting to assess the FAO's operations for
the next two years must recognize the need for more liberal trade
policies and an end to large subsidies.
   Kerin also said the FAO's ability to respond to the world's food
problems is hindered by the financial crisis faced by the
organization because some countries have not paid their assessments.
   Saouma, of Lebanon, said the FAO is facing its worst financial
situation ever, with unpaid contributions totaling $175 million.
Organization officials said of that amount the United States owes
$143 million.
   The director-general said because of the problems the FAO has
had to scale down activities and services by $68 million over the
last three years.
   ``We have experienced virtually no growth in the last eight or
nine years, during which time needs have continued to mount,'' said
Saouma. He urged delegates to approve a 1990-91 budget of $574
million, and said that would provide only a net growth of 1 percent.
   Saouma gave this grim assessment of the world's food problems:
   Protectionism practiced by industrialized nations and the debt
crisis conspire against developing countries.
   ``In 1987 alone, the developed countries spent the colossal sum
of $290 billion simply to protect their own agriculture. Such a
policy obviously creates an obstacle for imports from the poor
countries,'' he said.
   With the debt crisis, developing countries send more money to
the developed countries than they receive from them. In 1988
developing countries paid $43 billion more than they received.
   Industrialized nations are poisoning the Earth and air.
   ``One international conference follows another and the number of
declarations multiplies, but in practice the world persists in its
suicidal behavior,'' Saouma said.

<HEAD>Corps of Engineers Meets With Mobridge Citizens Over Tumbleweeds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBRIDGE, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chop 'em, burn 'em or plow them under, but
get rid of them before the next westerly wind starts to blow. Mayor
Darrell Bender wants federal help with his tumbleweed problem.
   ``There's weeds out there over my head, and I'm six feet tall,''
the mayor said Monday after meeting with officials of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers from Pierre.
   Ball-shaped weeds grew to the size of cars on the wide mud flats
created by the falling level of the Missouri River. The water line
is 38 feet below the full mark.
   Last week strong winds snapped them loose and sent them bouncing
into Mobridge by the thousands where the weeds buried homes,
clogged streets and snagged in treetops.
   The big concern is fire, said Bender, because tumbleweeds burn
explosively.
   The city spent $8,500 gathering and destroying the weeds, most
of that borrowed from the snow removal budget. ``Our city is 4,180
people, and that cuts a dent in our budgeting process,'' Bender
said.
   Corps officials told Bender to send a letter detailing his costs
and asking for reimbursement but made no promises.
   There's no money allocated to pay for the cleanup or to destroy
the millions of tumbleweeds still on federal land, the officials
said. The weeds are growing thick in an area about 2 miles long and
up to a mile wide, Bender said.
   Corps officials toured the tumbleweed areas Monday to get ideas
for control. They gave no timetable and said they don't know
whether the weeds will be chopped up, burned or plowed under.
   The Corps officials said the government plans to seed the mud
flats with a crop that will deter tumbleweeds next summer.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of center-right parties led by
novelist Mario Vargas Llosa swept mayoral races nationwide,
according to results released Monday, strengthening Vargas Llosa's
bid for the presidency.
   Despite death threats from Maoist Shining Path guerrillas,
Peruvians turned out in large numbers Sunday to elect mayors in
nearly 2,000 municipalities.
   Guerrillas caused the most problems in Huancayo, an Andean city
140 miles east of Lima. Election officials there counted ballots by
candlelight Sunday night after the Shining Path blew up several
power pylons, causing a blackout.
   Vargas Llosa's Democratic Front won 23 mayoral posts of Lima's
40 suburban districts.
   The United Left, a coalition of Marxist-led parties, won five of
the posts. The Socialist Accord, a grouping of moderate left
parties, won one district mayor's seat and an independent emerged
victorious in another. Results for the remaining seats were not in.
   A political independent, television personality Ricardo Belmont,
defeated Juan Inchaustegui, Vargas Llosa's candidate, in the race
for mayor of metropolitan Lima.
   But Belmont said before Sunday's voting that he supports Vargas
Llosa in the April presidential race, and the novelist embraced
Belmont as one of his own.
   The governing Aprista Party of President Alan Garcia lost all 18
of the posts it held in the Lima districts.
   With Peru suffering from 3,000 percent annual inflation, the
Aprista Party was given little chance of winning many seats.
   The Democratic Front also dominated races in major cities
throughout Peru, according to vote tallies available Monday.
   With counting completed in 15 of Peru's 24 state capitals, the
Democratic Front controlled eight of the mayoral offices, the
United Left two, the Aprista Party two, and political independents
or small regional parties held the others.
   ``This has been the best demonstration before the world that
Peru is not the Shining Path, is not crimes or kidnappings, but is
a country that wants to live in peace and democracy,'' Vargas Llosa
said.
   Results from small towns throughout Peru were not expected for
several days because of poor communications. Analysts said they
expected them to follow the pattern of the bigger cities.
   The Shining Path, which has been fighting since 1980 to topple
Peru's elected governments, sought to disrupt the voting as the
first stage in its campaign to block the presidential election.
   Death threats by the rebels, who have killed scores of officials
and candidates this year, frightened anyone from running for office
in more than 80 municipalities.
   Voting was mandatory, but the rebels threatened to kill anyone
who cast ballots. The armed forces and police took control of
larger towns and cities and provided security for voters.
   Total voter turnout was not known because of the lack of
communication with remote regions.
   Despite precautions, rebel violence killed seven people on
election day.
   Authorities said Shining Path guerrillas shot and killed the
Aprista Party's mayoral candidate early Sunday in Azangaro, near
the Bolivian border 470 miles southeast of Lima.
   A man and a woman were electrocuted by falling power lines when
a pylon was dynamited in the Andean town of Concepcion.
   Three adults and a child were killed and three people were
wounded when one of them stepped on a mine on a road a few miles
north of Huancayo as they were returning home from the polls,
police said.

<HEAD>Police Hunt for Missing Doctor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Monday joined a Virginia surgeon's
family in the search for the physician, who mysteriously
disappeared from his hotel last week.
   Todd Arcomano ``vanished into thin air,'' his older brother,
Keith, said.
   The 32-year-old surgeon from Arlington, Va., checked into the
Four Seasons Hotel a week ago, the day before he was to take an
American Board of Surgeons certification test.
   Arcomano never showed up for the test.
   People believed to be missing sometimes just don't want to be
found, police said, but Arcomano's family said the evidence in his
case indicates otherwise.
   The doctor's sports car is still parked in the hotel lot, and
the car keys were found on a table in his room. The bed appears not
to have been used, and Arcomano's shaving kit was still in the
bathroom.
   On Friday, hotel employees, noting that Arcomano had planned to
stay only a day and that the room appeared unused, notified his
Arlington office, which contacted the family Saturday, family
members said.
   Arcomano's parents, Nicholas and Ella Cecilia Arcomano, and
Keith Arcomano came from Long Branch, which is about 50 miles
northeast of Philadelphia, to look for him. They roamed the
streets, checked restaurants and bars and talked to taxi drivers.
   Detectives circulated the doctor's photograph, interviewed
relatives and other people, and alerted hospitals, police spokesman
Edward Tenuto said Monday.
   Keith Arcomano said the only clue the family has is a piece of
hotel stationery found in the room, on which the doctor had
scribbled directions from the hotel to 30th Street Station,
Philadelphia's main Amtrak station.
   Even if the doctor had planned to meet someone at the train
station, family members said, he would have eventually contacted
them. He was due in Long Branch on Saturday for a birthday party
for his father.
   On Nov. 3, another medical organization, the American Board of
Emergency Medicine, postponed certification tests for 2,000
emergency-room doctors in eight cities, including Philadelphia,
because of threatening letters sent to the physicians and those who
were to give the test.
   Philadelphia police said there appeared to be no connection.
   No arrests have been made in the medical test case, said Floyd
Wiltze, an FBI spokesman in New York City. Those tests will be held
sometime next year, said board Executive Director Benson Munger.
   Arcomano is a general surgeon at Arlington Hospital in suburban
Washington. In September 1988, he performed an emergency
appendectomy there on Washington Redskins quarterback Doug Williams.

<HEAD>U.N. Budget Still Funds Ethiopian, Thai Conference Centers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Assembly's budget committee on
Monday decided to continue funding a $94 million conference center
in Ethiopia and a $44 million center in Thailand, despite Western
opposition.
   ``We continue to have strong reservations concerning these two
construction projects,'' said Lawrence Grossman, the U.S. delegate
on the budget committee. He said the money ``should have been put
to better use.''
   The Ethiopian center in Addis Ababa has been especially
criticized by the Western nations that have been the main source of
famine relief for Ethiopia, which has suffered recurring droughts
and is fighting two rebel movements.
   But the United States, Britain and other Western nations that
said the conference facilities were unnecessary joined in the
consensus to approve more funds toward their construction.
   There have been efforts to suspend or cut funds for the two
projects since they were first proposed in 1984. Third World
countries that have a majority in the General Assembly and budget
committee have managed to overrule Western objections.
   On Monday the budget committee approved $27.3 million over the
next two years for the Addis Ababa center, with the basic
construction to be completed in 1993.
   It allocated $16.8 million for the next two years on the Bangkok
center. Main construction is to be finished by the end of 1991.
   The developing nations say the United Nations has established
facilities in New York, Paris, Vienna, Washington, Rome and Geneva,
and they deserve more representation in the U.N. system.

<TEXT>
   President Bush bestowed the presidential Medal
of Freedom on Lech Walesa in an emotional White House ceremony
Monday and promised ``American aid has begun and more is coming''
to Poland.
   ``Lech Walesa showed how one individual could inspire in others
a faith so powerful that it vindicated itself, and changed the
course of a nation,'' Bush said, referring to the 1981 martial law
crackdown against the first free trade union in the Soviet Bloc and
its rise to power this year.
   ``History may make men, but Lech Walesa has made history,'' Bush
said.
   The portly Polish trade union leader arrived in Washington as
the Senate reached a bipartisan compromise on a plan to give $657
million in aid to Poland and $65 million to Hungary, ending a long
battle over the proper scale of aid to those countries.
   At the White House, Walesa's eyes filled with tears as Bush
seated him in a chair with the Solidarity banner draped across it
and recalled the 1981 martial law crackdown in Poland and the 11
months that Walesa spent incarcerated in a remote hunting lodge.
   ``One of the greatest dreams of my life has just been
fulfilled,'' Walesa said in thanking Bush.
   The United States, he said, is a democratic example for nations
around the world.
   ``I am full of admiration for your country, not because it is a
big power, and not because it is rich,'' said Walesa. ``I admire
America as a country of freedom, freedom of man and freedom of the
nation.''
   ``You took that freedom yourselves. Nobody gave it to you as a
present. You built it through your hard work, step by step, created
wonderful democratic institutions, which are an example for many
other countries,'' he said.
   The crowd of 200 politicians, labor leaders and others packed
into the East Room gave Walesa a standing ovation on his entrance
with the president. Bush, too, joined in the applause, which became
rhythmic.
   Walesa blinked back tears as Bush recalled how he was taken off
to prison on the night of Dec. 13, 1981 after making ``the sign of
the cross on the foreheads of his sleeping children.'' A translator
whispered Bush's words into Walesa's ear.
   After Bush's 10-minute speech, a military aide brought a box
containing the Presidential Medal of Freedom and Bush draped around
Walesa's neck the gold medal, dangling from a blue ribbon.
   At the end of the ceremony, Bush surprised Lane Kirkland,
president of the AFL-CIO, by giving him the Presidential Citizen's
Medal for his union's efforts on behalf of Solidarity.
   Walesa greeted Kirkland with a bear hug.
   Walesa's trip to the White House was the first stop on a U.S.
tour that will include a speech to Congress, a private dinner at
the White House and attendance at the annual convention of the
AFL-CIO, the American trade union federation.
   Bush, in his remarks, said ``Lech Walesa, by your abiding faith,
and by the miracle of democracy's new birth in your homeland, you
have come to personify the new breeze that is sweeping the world
East and West, the spiritual godfather of a new generation of
democracy.''
   Walesa and his ``fellow workers in a brave union called
Solidarity'' are shattering the communist hold on Eastern Europe,
said Bush.
   ``The iron curtain is fast becoming a rusted abandoned relic,
symbolizing a lost era and failed ideology,'' he said.
   And Walesa's example, said the president, ``was mirrored across
Asia when `People Power' became a chant, first heard in the
Philippines, then in Pakistan, and South Korea, and yes, even in
Tiananmen Square'' where Chinese students demonstrated last summer.
   The president, who has been criticized by Democrats in Congress
for not doing enough to stimulate change in the Soviet Bloc,
pointedly welcomed ``Lech Walesa _ a man of freedom'' to ``the
White House _ the house of freedom.''
   Walesa returns to the White House on Tuesday night for a private
dinner with President Bush.
   On Wednesday, Walesa addresses a joint session of Congress, the
first foreigner without a government job to do so since the
American Revolutionary War hero the Marquis de Lafayette, a
Frenchman, spoke there in 1824.
   Addressing the Canadian Auto Workers Union on Sunday, Walesa
cautioned that if the West doesn't enthusiastically back Poland's
economic recovery, it risks a brutal crackdown on the reforms now
sweeping Eastern Europe.
   The bloody crushing of the pro-democracy movement in China last
summer ``is an excellent example of what could happen when the
economic and political reforms do not go hand in hand,'' Walesa
said.
   After leaving Washington on Thursday, Walesa was to visit New
York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Caracas, Venezuela.
   His visit is sponsored by the AFL-CIO, which has backed
Solidarity since it was founded in August 1980 as the first
independent trade union in the Soviet bloc. Walesa was to address
an AFL-CIO convention on Tuesday.
   Walesa left Poland on Friday, the day after the opening of the
Berlin Wall, the most striking symbol of Soviet domination of
Eastern Europe.
   He first rocketed to international fame nine years ago climbing
over another wall, that surrounding the Gdansk shipyard, to lead
the strike that forged Solidarity nine years ago.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas, who in four years as
prosecutor tackled fraud in the futures exchanges, City Hall
corruption and El Rukn street gang, announced Monday he is
returning to private practice.
   ``It's been a good time, a great time _ the years were well
spent to say the least,'' said Valukas, 45, who has been federal
prosecutor for northern Illinois since his 1985 appointment by
former President Reagan.
   ``I'll miss this. You bet I'll miss this,'' he said. ``But I
also think it's time for me to go do something else.''
   Valukas' resignation takes effect Dec. 3, when he will return to
Jenner and Block, the firm he left to take the prosecutor's post.
   He said he believes his tenure ``made things a little fairer in
this community,'' noting prosecutions of people with political or
financial clout.
   ``We attained convictions in virtually all cases,'' Valukas
said, which suggests ``our judgment was sound, our lawyering good.
I hope that would be a hallmark of this time in office.'' He said
the office's conviction rate was around 97 percent during his
tenure.
   Word that Valukas might leave had been circulating in Chicago
and at his announcement _ even before in some cases _ local
officials were quick with praise.
   ``His efforts helped clean up every area he looked into, whether
it be the judicial system or drugs or white-collar crime,'' said
Gov. James R. Thompson, who once held the post.
   Valukas said his salary was $77,500 and that he had one child in
college and another scheduled to begin next fall. He declined to
say what his earnings had been in private practice.
   Some of Valukas' earliest successes came at the expense of
politicians in Chicago's City Hall and from there he took on
organized crime in the suburbs and white-collar crime in business.
   News that a federal investigation was under way in the world's
two largest commodities exchanges rocked the financial world in
January. In August, 46 traders and a clerk were accused of
fraudulent trading practices at the Chicago Board of trade and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Asked whether he was likely to take another crack at the trading
practices before leaving, Valukas said, laughing, ``I hope so.''
   He also directed the contract-fraud case against Rockford-based
Sundstrand Corp., which resulted in more than $115 million in
penalties against the aerospace contractor in October 1988 _ the
largest such settlement in Defense Department history.
   He directed Operation Incubator, a probe of City Hall
corruption; Operation Safebet, an investigation of organized
crime's suburban influence; and Operation Phocus, a probe of
corruption in licensing.
   In addition, he oversaw the recent wave of indictments against
members of El Rukn, a South Side gang, on charges ranging from
conspiracy to murder related to drug running, and directed
follow-up on Operation Greylord, a probe of Cook County court
corruption that sent 15 judges to jail.
   President Bush will name Valukas' successor.

<HEAD>Bhutto's Cabinet Offers to Resign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's
Cabinet offered Monday to resign to open the way for a government
reshuffle after a no-confidence vote came close to toppling her
governing party, officials said.
   Government sources said the offer was mainly a formality but
that several advisers and special assistants were likely to go.
   ``I will make changes in the Cabinet at a suitable time,'' Ms.
Bhutto was quoted as saying by Pakistan's state television.
   Sources said the move was a response to criticism that the prime
minister, during 11 months in power, has surrounded herself with
officials who have alienated her from her own Pakistan People's
Party.
   Earlier Monday, a dozen lower-level appointees resigned from
posts in national security, political affairs and finance. The
source said Ms. Bhutto was expected to accept all 12 resignations
but some of the appointees might be reassigned to other government
posts.
   Ms. Bhutto promised changes in her left-leaning government
following a parliamentary no-confidence motion on Nov. 1. The
motion fell just 12 votes short of a majority in the 237-seat
National Assembly.
   The mainly right-wing opposition accused the government of
ineffectiveness and cronyism.
   Apparently shaken by the close call, Ms. Bhutto, 36, said she
would purge her government of controversial figures and reach out
to what she termed ``moderate elements'' of the mainly right-wing
political opposition.
   The Pakistan People's Party emerged as the nation's single
largest party last November in Pakistan's first free elections
after 11 years of military rule under late President Gen. Mohammad
Zia ul-Haq.
   Zia, who overthrew Ms. Bhutto's father in 1977 and had him
hanged two years later, died in a plane crash in August 1988.
   Ms. Bhutto's party claims about 111 seats in the federal
legislature but rules mainly with the help of independents.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III accused
the Soviet Union on Monday of supporting ``violence, destruction
and war'' in Central America and he said these activities are the
biggest obstacle to genuine superpower accommodation.
   In a speech to foreign ministers of the Organization of American
States, Baker also said the United States will never accommodate
itself to the ``outlaw regime'' in Panama and he called for the
international community to isolate that country.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Leonardo Kam responded immediately,
calling U.S. policies toward his country ``fascist.''
   Baker's remarks on the Soviet Union reinforced the notion that
Central America may be the most divisive issue when President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev have their Mediterranean
summit in three weeks.
   ``The Soviet Union bears a special responsibility because its
arms and money, moving through Cuba and Nicaragua, continue to
support violence, destruction and war,'' Baker said.
   He said shipments of Soviet weapons to leftist rebels in El
Salvador are incompatible with the ``new thinking'' in Moscow _ the
term Gorbachev uses to describe his break with past policy.
   ``Soviet behavior toward Cuba and Central America remains the
biggest obstacle to a full across-the-board improvement with the
United States and the Soviet Union.''
   Baker said the United States would be pleased to have normal
relations with a democratic Panama. But, he said, ``there is a
dictator, and his name is (Gen. Manuel Antonio) Noriega.'' He added
that after the release Monday of an OAS report critical of Panama,
no ``self respecting democracy'' should make an accommodation with
that country.
   After Baker's remarks, Kam said the U.S. diplomat was resorting
``to a very old formula _ a fascist one _ of repeating time and
again false words so that they could ring true.'' He said Panama
was a victim of ``relentless U.S. aggression.''
   Until Baker spoke, the mood at the meeting was upbeat, with
speaker after speaker hailing the entry of Canada as the 32nd
member of the OAS. About 25 foreign ministers were on hand for the
opening day deliberations.
   Costa Rica introduced a resolution calling on all OAS member
states to withraw their ambassadors from Panama until a process is
under way there to restore democracy.
   The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, an OAS agency,
said in its report on Panama that the Panamanian government
routinely violates the rights of its citizens to, among other
things, life, humane treatment, personal liberty and judicial
guarantees.
   The commission called on Panama to take ``immediate steps to
control the excessive violence that the Defense Force police and
paramilitary groups employ against the civilian population.''
   These forces, the report said, must end the ``mistreatment,
torture and other cruel and inhuman and degrading treatment that
the Defense Forces inflict upon individuals deprived of their
freedom.''
   An OAS effort to try to arrange a democratic transfer of power
in Panama was suspended in late August after it became apparent
that Noriega was not interested in surrendering power.
   A separate OAS report on Nicaragua demands the release of all
political prisoners and says that there are no guarantees the Feb.
25 national elections there will be free and fair because of
built-in advantages enjoyed by the incumbent Sandinistas.
   The renewed fighting in El Salvador prompted Nicaraguan Foreign
Minister Miguel D'Escoto to introduce a resolution calling on the
OAS to make an urgent appeal to the government of El Salvador ``to
cease immediately the bombing of the civilian population.''
   Shortly before the afternoon session was convened, a delegation
of Sandinista and Nicaraguan Contra officials met at an OAS annex
several blocks away. The talks are a continuation of discussions
begun last Thursday at the United Nations.
   The objective is to reach agreement restoring the cease fire and
to lay the groundwork for the demobilization of the Contras.
   A number of OAS countries have expressed support for the
readmission of Cuba to the OAS after a 27-year absence.
   Cuba has said it is ready to accept an OAS invitation but
diplomats said that issue was not likely to come up at this year's
meeting.
   The United States has lobbied hard against Cuba's readmission,
citing alleged Cuban support for subversion in Central America and
reported human rights abuses.

   An independent group in Czechoslovakia
has applied to register as a political party for the first time,
emigre sources said Monday.
   While Communist leaders in other Warsaw Pact countries have
offered to share power or at least open a dialogue with the
opposition, Czechoslovak Communists so far have refused to engage
in dialogue with opposition groups.
   According to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
the Democratic Initiative sent a letter Saturday signed by eight
founders to the Interior Ministry, asking to be registered as a
political party.
   The group emphasized in the letter that it wished to be an
independent political party with the goal of overcoming the current
social crisis. The group also said it wanted to work toward
establishing a pluralistic, democratic society, the sources said.
   There was no immediate official reaction to the letter.

   A state appeals court Monday upheld a judge's
decision to seat a black juror over defense objections, allowing
the trial of a Miami policeman who shot and killed a black
motorcyclist to resume.
   The trial of William Lozano stalled Friday when the defense
targeted the juror for a peremptory challenge. Dade County Circuit
Judge Joseph Farina ruled the action was based soley on race, and
therefore illegal.
   The 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled that the defense
challenge was based on race alone, that the juror should be seated
and that there was no need to dissolve the jury and start jury
selection again.
   The trial will resume Tuesday afternoon, said Assistant State
Attorney John Hogan, the lead prosecutor. Opening arguments may not
begin until Wednesday, he said.
   ``Obviously I'm happy that we're able to proceed,'' Hogan said.
``We think it's a fair jury.''
   Telephone calls seeking comment from defense attorney Roy Black
were not returned immediately.
   The ruling came after three weeks of jury selection in the trial
of the Colombian-born police officer charged with two counts of
manslaughter in the Jan. 16 deaths of the motorcyclist and his
passenger. The killings set off three days of racial violence in
Miami's black neighborhoods.
   The three-judge appeals panel had stayed the trial while it
considered the issue. The court could have decided to throw out the
entire jury pool, following previous appellate court decisions.
   The defense had strenuously denied challenging the black juror,
Ezra Simmons, because of his race, noting they had already accepted
another black juror on the six-member panel. The jury consists of
two blacks, one Hispanic and three non-Hispanic whites.

   About 1,000 environmentalists
demonstrated in Teplice late Monday and a local Communist Party
official promised to meet with them next week, official media
reported.
   A dispatch from the official news agency CTK said the
demonstrators, most of whom were young, assembled outside party
headquarters in Teplice, 30 miles northwest of Prague.
   It said Antonin Vana, a party secretary, addressed the group and
said an open meeting to discuss the environment would be held at a
Teplice stadium next Monday.
   Palach Press, a publishing house in London operated by
Czechoslovak emigres, said police initially tried to disperse the
crowd, but Vana arranged for the officers to withdraw and told the
crowd he had not called them.
   His pledge of a public meeting was rare in Czechoslovakia, whose
Communist leadership has resisted the reforms now spreading through
Eastern Europe with the blessing of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.

   A Halloween incident in which two students
wore white garments resembling Ku Klux Klan robes to high school
has prompted community and school leaders to confront racial
problems, a parent said Monday.
   Victoria Nash, 37, a lifelong resident of this southwestern Ohio
city, said racial ignorance and tensions have been a problem in the
Talawanda school district since she was a child but have not been
acknowledged until now.
   Ms. Nash helped to arange a Nov. 3 march in which more than 500
people protested the incident.
   ``We're encouraged with what the march has brought about. ...
The community, including the school, has agreed that there is a
problem that has been identified that is severe,'' Ms. Nash said.
``When I was in the school system, the system was not willing to
say there was a problem.''
   Clergymen and parents, including Ms. Nash, have formed a
committee of about 50 people that is intended to monitor the
situation, recommend solutions and work with school officials on
implementing them, she said.
   The two Talawanda High School students in their robes were
cheered by some students, according to other students and their
parents. The students, whom school officials won't identify, remain
on suspension.
   High school Principal Lee Schmitt participated in the march. He
said the school system will consider revising its curriculum to
include instruction about racial tolerance and cultural differences.
   All but about 50 students in the 1,100-student high school are
white.

   A farm couple who hired drifters to buy
cattle was charged Monday with killing three former employees whose
bodies were found in northern Missouri barns last month.
   Attorney General William Webster announced the filing of
first-degree murder charges against Ray Copeland, 75, of
Mooresville, and his wife, Faye, 68, at a news conference at the
Livingston County Jail.
   The Copelands have been held in the jail since Oct. 9 on charges
of conspiracy to steal cattle with bad checks from an account set
up for an employee. The conspiracy charge was dismissed Monday, but
neither Webster nor Prosecuting Attorney Doug Roberts would say why.
   Webster said the decision to seek the death penalty was based on
allegations that the victims were killed for money and to cover up
another crime.
   The Copelands were not charged Monday in the death of a fourth
man whose body was found in another barn more than a week later.
Webster said medical examiners are reviewing evidence in that case.
   Copeland, wearing a bright orange county-issued jumpsuit, was
silent and showed no emotion at his hearing. His bond was set at
$500,000.
   Mrs. Copeland, wearing a blue slicker and orange jail pants,
also was held under $500,000 bond. She cried during her hearing and
tried to make a statement before her lawyer advised her not to say
anything.
   A search for bodies started Oct. 9 after a former employee
alerted authorities that he had seen a human skull and leg bone at
the Copeland farm.
   Bloodhounds and backhoes were used for a week at the Copelands'
40-acre farm near Mooresville, 90 miles northeast of Kansas City.
Some evidence _ weapons and papers _ was found, but no bodies were
unearthed.
   Meanwhile, the North Central Missouri Major Case Squad, a team
of 20 officers from nine counties, was activated Oct. 13 to assist
in the search, which was expanded to other farms in the area.
   The decomposed bodies of three men were discovered three days
later in shallow graves in a barn near Ludlow. The barn is on a
farm about 12 miles south of Copeland's place where Copeland had
done odd jobs for several years.
   Each of the men _ Paul J. Cowart, 21, of Dardanelle, Ark., John
W. Freeman, 27, of Tulsa, Okla., and Jimmie Dale Harvey, 27, of
Springfield, Mo. _ had been shot in the head. The charges filed
Monday stem from their deaths.
   The three victims had ties to a Springfield mission where
Copeland sometimes showed up to hire transients.
   A fourth decomposed body was found Oct. 25 in a barn about three
miles away where Copeland also had done odd jobs for several years.
The man, also killed by a gunshot to the head, has not been
identified.
   Investigators have said that as many as 20 drifters worked for
the Copelands since 1986. Nine of them remain unaccounted for,
although digging has been halted and the major case squad disbanded.
   Sheriff Leland O'Dell said Monday that authorities have searched
about 100 sites.
   Documents on the theft conspiracy charge in Livingston County
Circuit Court say the Copelands intended to use a 57-year-old
transient to buy cattle in August with bad checks, then sell the
cattle and retain the proceeds. They opened a checking account and
post office box for the man, the conspiracy charge says.

<HEAD>HUD Lender Sues, Alleging Unfair Audits Tainted Its Reputation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lender on Department of Housing and Urban
Development probation amid allegations it inflated mortgages to pad
its fees filed suit against the agency on Monday.
   The plaintiff, Benton Mortgage Co. of Knoxville, Tenn., alleged
that shoddy auditing led to the charges and that HUD refuses to
give the company a chance to rebut them.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, contended that
department auditors violated auditing standards and ``violated
their duty to report accurately and fairly the findings of their
own investigation'' when they issued a report accusing the company
of inflating mortgages for more than a dozen projects.
   A second suit filed by Benton seeks a court order forcing HUD to
give its final endorsement to two Benton-financed projects that are
completed but have not received final clearance for financing in
HUD's co-insurance program.
   The projects are the 352-unit Pebble Creek Apartments in
Arlington, Texas, and the 312-unit Kingsley Park Apartments in
Essex, Md.
   That program is one of several criticized by internal and
congressional investigators during recent investigations of
mismanagement and influence-peddling at the department during the
Reagan administration.
   Benton was the co-insuring lender on a number of housing
projects that also participated in the Moderate Rehabilitation
Program, which auditors determined was riddled with influence
peddling involving former agency officials and prominent
Republicans.
   The audit of Benton that led to its being placed on probation
alleged that Benton had approved inflated mortgages on 14 projects
reviewed by the auditors, allegedly allowing Benton to reap higher
fees and developers of the projects to receive excessive rent
subsidies because those payments are based on the mortgage amount.
   Justice Department investigators have reviewed the audit and the
working papers used to compile it but have declined comment on the
investigation.
   HUD spokesman William Glavin said the department had no comment
on Benton's lawsuits.
   Benton Chairman Fred Benton said in a statement that all of the
projects cited in the audit had been approved by officials in the
department. He complained that the department has ignored repeated
requests for a meeting to discuss the allegations.
   ``It seems as if HUD just doesn't want to deal with the fact
that the audit findings are incorrect,'' Benton said. ``Apparently
HUD was fishing for scapegoats.''

<HEAD>Divided Court Upholds Partial Merger of Detroit Newspapers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 12th graf: ``Hall said,'' to CORRECT name of operating

<TEXT>
   An evenly divided Supreme Court cleared the
way Monday for the partial merger of Detroit's two daily newspapers
in its first ruling on a 1970 law aimed at saving failing
newspapers.
   But opponents of the deal said the 4-4 vote suggests such joint
operating agreements are on shaky ground. They vowed to fight to
restrain future mergers in any of the remaining two dozen or so
cities with competing dailies.
   The high court split affirmed a lower court ruling that former
Attorney General Edwin Meese III acted reasonably last year when he
approved plans by the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News to
merge their business, production and advertising staffs but
maintain editorial independence.
   The federal Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 authorizes the
attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an
exemption from federal antitrust laws.
   Justice Byron R. White removed himself from the case for
unexplained personal reasons. The remaining eight justices
announced their ruling in a terse statement that did not reveal how
each voted.
   The future of such newspaper mergers ``is really on eggshells,''
said a leading opponent of the Detroit agreement, W. Edward
Wendover, publisher and editor of The Community Crier of Plymouth
in suburban Detroit.
   ``So, I think the focus of our opposition now switches to
Capitol Hill,'' he said.
   Supporters of the Detroit agreement said the papers will remain
editorially, if not financially, competitive.
   ``We're joined at the wallet but not at the heart,'' said Free
Press reporter Joe Swickard.
   ``We're very happy that the last hurdle has finally been
crossed,'' said Sheila Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Gannett Co. Inc.,
owner of The Detroit News. ``With the history of the two
newspapers, I'm sure you will continue to see heavy competition.''
   ``People are happy, glad it's over, said Robert J. Hall,
publisher and chairman of the Free Press. ``But we've been through
this before and there is probably still some degree of hesitation
and disbelief.''
   The combination will become effective Nov. 27, with the first
joint Saturday paper on Dec. 2 and the first joint Sunday paper the
following day, said William Keating, president of the joint
operating entity, the Detroit Newspaper Agency.
   Under a 100-year agreement, the Detroit newspapers will combine
their business, advertising and production departments but maintain
separate editorial staffs.
   The News will receive 55 percent of the merged company's profits
during the first year, dropping to 50 percent by the seventh year
and thereafter.
   The 4-4 vote by the justices leaves in doubt how the court would
treat future newspaper agreements with White, presumably, the
controlling vote.
   Gannett is the nation's largest newspaper publishing group.
Knight-Ridder Inc., owner of the Free Press, is the second largest.
They proposed the partial merger in 1986.
   Opponents of the deal, calling themselves Michigan Citizens for
an Independent Press, contend that the Free Press is not a failing
newspaper even though it lost $10 million a year between 1981 and
1986.
   The opponents say the Free Press and the News, which lost $50
million in the same period, were unprofitable solely because both
papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out
of business.
   Knight-Ridder's lawyers had said the Free Press would be shut
down if the joint operating agreement did not go through. But an
investor group from Michigan recently offered to buy the newspaper
for $68 million.
   The newspapers have said that the agreement will eliminate some
500 jobs. They said closing the Free Press would have eliminated
2,200 jobs.
   The justices were urged by the Bush administration to uphold the
partial merger to protect the dwindling number of two-newspaper
cities in the United States.
   But opponents of the deal said such a ruling would be ``a
terrific incentive for monopoly'' conduct by competing papers,
giving them a blueprint on how to force approval of a joint
operating agreement.
   A federal appeals court panel here last year voted 2-1 to uphold
Meese's decision. The full appeals court split 5-4 in refusing to
review the three-judge panel's rulings.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Calls Special EC Summit to Discuss Changing Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand has invited the
leaders of the European Community countries to a special meeting
Saturday to discuss the rapidly changing situation in Europe, the
presidential palace announced.
   The announcement Monday said the 12-nation meeting would be held
Saturday evening at the Elysee Palace.
   The cascade of events in Eastern Europe in recent weeks,
culminating in the decision by East Germany Friday to begin
dismantling the Berlin Wall, has opened new questions for Western
European leaders on the continent's future.
   Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of France's main
centrist political coalition, had urged Mitterrand to call an
urgent meeting of European Community leaders before the U.S.-Soviet
summit scheduled for Dec. 2-3 aboard ships off Malta.
   A European Community summit is set for Dec. 8-9.
   ``It would not be acceptable that the analysis of the situation
in Europe be made by the Americans and the Soviets and not by the
Europeans themselves,'' Giscard d'Estaing said in a radio interview
Sunday night.
   The statement from Mitterrand's office said, ``The president has
invited the chiefs of state or government of the 11 other countries
of the European Economic Community as well as the president of the
commission to the Elysee Palace Saturday night Nov. 18 to discuss
with them the recent developments in the situation in Europe.''
Jacques Delors is president of the European Commission, the
executive body of the European Community.
   Last week during a visit to Denmark, Mitterrand said that with
the opening of the Berlin Wall by East Germany, Europe was evolving
from ``the order established after the Second World War'' but it
was too early to set out ``a new balance.''
   Mitterrand is the president of the European Community under the
six-month rotating system. His term will end with the Dec. 8-9
summit in Strasbourg.

   The Senate reached bipartisan compromise
Monday on a $738 million aid plan for Poland and Hungary two days
before Solidarity leader Lech Walesa is to address a joint meeting
of Congress.
   The compromise ends a long and divisive battle over the proper
scale of aid to Poland and incorporates safeguards sought by
Republicans to make sure the money doesn't go to communist
governments.
   Senate Democrats originally had sought a three-year spending
level for the two East European nations of $989 millions while
Republicans sought a $585 million authorization level.
   The agreement is expected to pass the Senate on Tuesday, and
must be reconciled with a slightly different House version.
   The heart of the compromise aid bill, the establishment of an
Enterprise Fund to help both countries establish free-market
systems, allocates $260 million for Poland and $65 million for
Hungary. Overall, the bill, recognizing Poland's serious economic
problems, would give that country $657 million over the three-year
period, while Hungary would receive $81 million.
   Earlier, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell urged President
Bush to go to Berlin to hail ``the figurative and literal
destruction of the Berlin Wall.
   ``To acknowledge the tremendous significance of the symbolic
destruction of the Berlin Wall and to give voice to the
exhilaration felt by all Americans, I urge President Bush to travel
to West Berlin,'' Mitchell said.
   Earlier Monday, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he
could not ``foresee any set of circumstances at this moment that
would induce'' Bush to go to Berlin.
   In related action, the Senate unanimously approved a resolution
welcoming the opening of the wall, condemning it as a ``symbol of
oppression'' and calling for its ``complete destruction.''
   Mitchell said the president should react to events in East
Germany by quickly convening a meeting of the Western allies to
plan a unified and coordinated response to the tumultuous spin of
events in Eastern Europe and its implications for the future.
   The Maine Democrat urged Bush to promptly suspend trade barriers
against the Soviet Union and to reward Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reform program by granting Moscow observer status at
international economic institutions.
   ``The wall, symbol of division between East and West, has been
dissolved by the East German people's desire for change, for
freedom, for control of their future,'' Mitchell said.
   ``It has been 40 years since the West demonstrated its
commitment to the city's freedom by helping break the blockade
strangling Berlin,'' he said. ``It would be fitting for the
American president to travel there to underscore the American
commitment to the freedom of Berlin and our support for Democratic
reform in East Germany.''
   Mitchell also urged the president to give more urgency than ever
to completing the talks underway in Vienna on reductions in
conventional forces.
   He said success in the Vienna talks can complement the reforms
taking place in the East.
   Meanwhile, House Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt sharply
scored Bush's reaction to events in Eastern Europe, saying, ``Even
as the walls of the modern Jericho come tumbling down, we have a
president who is inadequate to the moment.''
   ``The changes taking place in Europe should galvanize our
president into action,'' Gephardt said in remarks prepared for
delivery to the Democratic Leadership Council.
   ``But at the very time freedom and democracy are receiving
standing ovations in Europe, our president is sitting politely in
the audience with little to say and even less to contribute,''
Gephardt said.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas noted Democrats had
dropped a $200 million credit stabilization plan for Poland, a plan
he said Republicans believed would be unworkable.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., chief sponsor of the Democratic aid
plan, said the compromise makes Senate approval of the package on
Tuesday ``virtually certain.''
   The elevation of members of the Solidarity trade union to
leadership positions in the Polish government precipitated events
in East Germany, Simon said.
   ``East Germany just couldn't stand there is isolation,'' he said.
   ``If we can succeed in Poland in improving the standard of
living and promoting freedom, then East Germany is not going to
have that (communist) form of government very long,'' Simon said.
   President Bush had proposed a $455 million aid package for
Poland and Hungary but Dole indicated he will not oppose the
compromise.

<HEAD>Government Paying Farmers Too Much To Idle Land, GAO Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is losing more than $300
million a year because farmers are being paid too much to take
highly erodible land out of production, congressional investigators
reported Monday.
   Some farmers who enrolled land in the Conservation Reserve
Program are getting 200 percent to 300 percent more than the local
cash rental rate, because the Agriculture Department failed to set
the payments through competitive bidding, according to a General
Accounting Office study.
   The GAO also faulted the Agriculture Department for failing to
give priority to land that is the most prone to erosion or
contributes the most to water contamination, the report said.
   ``While CRP benefits are substantial, the overall impact and
effectiveness of the program could have been enhanced if USDA had
managed the program to address the full range of CRP objectives
instead of focusing on the need to enroll prescribed acerage
amounts,'' the report said.
   The Agriculture Department says it is running the program in ``a
cost-effective and efficient manner'' to meet Congress' goal of
idling up to 45 million acres by 1990.
   The report is expected to fuel a growing debate over
conservation program and environmental concerns as Congress writes
the nation's next farm program in 1990.
   Congress set up the program in the 1985 farm bill to reduce soil
erosion, improve water quality and cut production of surplus
commodities.
   More than 28 million acres of land were enrolled in the program
through December 1988 at a cost of $1.4 billion a year, cutting
soil erosion by 574 million tons a year, the GAO said.
   About 1.7 million acres were planted to trees, well short of
Congress' goal of having at least 12.5 million acres planted to
trees.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said the program ``is part of the foundations of
conservation policy in the upcoming 1990 farm bill.
   ``But we must also take this opportunity to build on the CRP, to
use it to improve water quality and address many of the other
environmental problems we face,'' said Leahy, who requested the
study.
   Texas led the nation with about 3.7 million acres idled as of
this summer, followed by North Dakota with 2.6 million and Kansas
with 2.5 million.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Reports More 8 Combat Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUIGALPA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Monday that the
Sandinista Army had killed eight rebels during two battles in
southeastern Nicaragua.
   A military spokesman said that deaths resulted from
confrontations in Acoyapa, 45 miles southeast of Managua, and in
Rama, 200 miles southeast of the capital. The spokesman said the
fighting occurred Friday and Saturday. The government did not
mention losses by its own troops.
   The Sandinista government began a major offensive against the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels on Nov. 1, when President Daniel Ortega
suspended a 19-month-old cease-fire with the rebels.
   Nicaragua estimates 4,000 Contras have slipped over the border
in recent weeks. There are about 12,000 Contra rebels living in
camps in Honduras along with their dependents.
   Contra rebels have been fighting the leftist Sandinista
government since 1981. They say the government betrayed the goals
of the 1979 revolution that brought down President Anastasio Somoza.
   According to peace accords signed last August in Tela, Honduras,
by five Central American presidents, the Contras will have to be
relocated or repatriated by the first week of December.
   Some Contras have said they are unwilling to demobilize before
national elections set for Feb. 25.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher advised the
Western allies Monday to make a careful, measured response to the
rapid political change in Eastern Europe.
   She also said in remarks to the Lord Mayor's banquet that the
European Economic Community should hold out a helping hand to the
democracies being formed in the Soviet bloc.
   In a message to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Mrs. Thatcher assured the
Soviet president the West does not intend to ``poach'' East Germany
from the Kremlin's sphere of influence, according to reports by
Independent Television News and Press Association, Britain's
domestic news agency.
   ``Freedom (is) once more on the offensive,'' Mrs. Thatcher said
in the speech, but ``times of great change are times of great
uncertainty, even danger.''
   After noting the extent and speed of reforms in the Soviet
Union, Poland, Hungary and East Germany, the prime minister
declared: ``The way in which we in the West respond to these
historic changes could be crucial in determining their success.
   ``The very speed of change could put the goal of democracy in
jeopardy. ... Strong emotions have been aroused on all sides by
recent events. The need now is to take a measured view of the way
ahead.''
   Mrs. Thatcher urged continuation of the ``strength and resolve''
of NATO, which she said set the stage for the reforms, and warned
against complacency.
   ``It must be through NATO that we continue to keep the peace by
tried and tested means, while welcoming every step that allows us
to do so safely at lower levels of forces and weapons,'' she said.
   ``We should honor those in the Communist countries who never let
repression and dictatorship break their spirit or their unshakeable
belief in liberty, and who are now seeing their hopes realized.
   ``We must give them every possible encouragement and support. We
are doing just that in all our contacts with the Soviet Union under
Mr. Gorbachev, and in the practical help _ with food, training,
trade _ that we are giving to Poland and Hungary. We cannot and
must not let their brave efforts fail.''
   The 12 nations of the European Economic Community have a special
responsibility to Eastern Europe, she said.
   ``We must stretch out the hand of co-operation and develop new
forms of association with the emerging democracies of Eastern
Europe _ Poland, Hungary, East Germany and, we hope, others will
follow.''

<HEAD>Communists to Try to Form Government After Others Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leader Harilaos Florakis
received a presidential mandate Monday to try to form a government
after both the conservatives and socialists failed.
   It was expected Florakis, leader of the Left and Progress
Coalition, also would be unable to arrange an alliance that would
have a parliamentary majority, extending Greece's political
stalemate indefinitely.
   Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis, whose New Democracy
Party won the most parliamentary seats in the Nov. 5 elections but
missed a majority, was the first to try to form a government.
   He met with Florakis and former socialist Premier Andreas
Papandreou last week but was unable to persuade either to join in a
short-term administration with his conservatives.
   President Christos Sartzetakis then issued a three-day
exploratory mandate to Papandreou but the unsuccessful Papandreou
returned without a mandate Monday.
   If Florakis cannot form a coalition, Sartzetakis will call the
leaders of the three major parties to a meeting to try to form a
joint administration.
   If that should fail, the president will call general elections,
which would be the third this year.
   Florakis has said the Left and Progress Coalition supports a
broad-based government. But it has made tough conditions, including
the removal of U.S. military bases from Greece and the rejection of
a U.S. request for the extradition of a suspected Palestinian
terrorist.
   New Democracy seeks closer ties with the United States and is
opposed to those conditions.
   Papandreou has said his socialists and the Left and Progress
Coalition are ``in almost total agreement,'' but Florakis rejected
his proposal to form a government that would exclude New Democracy.
   In the Nov. 5 elections New Democracy won 148 seats in the
300-member Parliament. Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement
won 128 seats and Florakis' coalition 21. Two seats went to
independents and one to an enviromentalist movement.
   The environmentalists declared Sunday they would not back
Papandreou.
   A socialist alliance with Left and Progress, with the support of
the only leftist independent, would control only 150 deputies _ one
short of a majority.
   The third independent represents a Moslem minority in northern
Greece and has not been approached by any party.
   Elections in June also failed to give any party a majority and
the conservatives and communists formed a short-term alliance,
ending eight years of government by Papandreou's socialists.
   That unusual alliance was formed mainly to investigate charges
of corruption in connection with a banking scandal against
Papandreou.
   Papandreou and five of his ministers were indicted and are
scheduled to be tried by special courts next year.

   Bruce Springsteen has told the E Street Band,
his backup group for the past 15 years, that he doesn't want to be
their Boss, according to a published report.
   The blue-collar rocker nicknamed ``the Boss'' telephoned all
seven band members to tell them he won't be using them on his next
album or concert tour, according to this week's issue of People
magazine.
   Springsteen told the band members they should feel free to
accept other offers, the magazine said.
   However, Barry Scott, an attorney who represents Springsteen,
said in a telephone interview in New York that he had not heard
anything about the personnel move.
   Phone calls to Springsteen's manager, John Landau, and Marilyn
Laverty, a spokeswoman for the band's label, Columbia Records, did
not immediately return messages left at their offices.
   People magazine said at least one band member probably got the
word in person _ singer Patti Scialfa, who is Springsteen's
girlfriend.

   President Roh Tae-woo said Monday he
hopes changes in Eastern Europe will prompt Communist North Korea
to open its closed society.
   In his regular radio address, Roh said his efforts to improve
relations with East bloc countries ``will at long last open the way
to national reconciliation and unification by inducing North Korea
to come out into the world.''
   Roh will visit Hungary as well as Britain, France, West Germany
and Switzerland Nov. 20-Dec. 2. He will be the first South Korean
president to visit a communist nation.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since Korea was divided
in 1945 at the end of World War II when Soviet and U.S. troops
ended the Japanese occupation.
   The Communist North invaded the South in 1950, triggering a
three-year war involving troops from China and the 16-nation U.N.
Command. Borders are now completely sealed off and guarded by
hundreds of troops, and each side punishes its citizens trying to
cross the border without prior approval.
   Dialogue has been held on and off between the two Koreas to help
reduce tension, but little progress has been made with each side
insisting on its own initiatives.
   In a statement Monday, South Korea's Unification Ministry urged
the North to carry out reforms and adopt changes in East Europe.
``We hope relations between the two Koreas will develop to a stage
at which residents are free to visit each other.''
   ``We expect the North to end confrontation with the South and
make orderly and peaceful changes by protecting liberty and human
rights,'' the statement said.
   The question of human rights and freedom in North Korea was a
main topic at a policy meeting Monday of senior government and
ruling party officials. Party leaders also urged the government to
take a more flexible attitude in dealing with North Korea to help
the North become more open, officials said.

<TEXT>
   A multiracial coalition gained a
substantial lead early Tuesday as ballots were counted for the
election of an assembly to lead Namibia to independence from South
Africa.
   The black nationalist group South-West Africa People's
Organization (SWAPO), which is expected to win, was in second place
with results from its strongholds still not counted.
   Taking the lead in the 10-party race was the pro-capitalist
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance.
   With 45 percent of the 660,000 ballots tabulated, the alliance
had 134,181 votes, or 43 percent, to SWAPO's 108,532 votes, or 35
percent.
   The figures came from 21 of the territory's 23 districts.
Leftist SWAPO was expected to capture the two populous northern
districts still outstanding and surpass the alliance, which favors
a capitalist economy.
   Results from the two most populous districts, Windhoek and the
northern region of Ovambo, were not expected until Wednesday. More
than half the voters are from those two districts and the left-wing
SWAPO was expected to do well in both.
   About 95 percent of Namibia's registered voters cast ballots
from Tuesday through Saturday to choose a 72-member assembly that
will draft Namibia's constitution.
   The assembly also will declare Namibian independence after 74
years of rule by South Africa.
   SWAPO, which fought a 23-year guerrilla war against South
Africa, was expected to receive the most votes, but there were
doubts it would receive the two-thirds needed to write the
constitution without consulting other parties.
   The assembly seats will be allocated according to the proportion
of votes won by each party.
   The first two candidates to win assembly seats were SWAPO
president Sam Nujoma and Turnhalle Alliance vice chairman Mishake
Muyongo _ each the top candidate on their party's lists. Each
assembly seat represents about 9,200 votes.
   Officials said results would be announced district-by-district
as they were totaled.
   Votes were counted at the fairgrounds in Windhoek, the capital.
Territorial police and soldiers of a U.N. monitoring force barred
the public and press from the area.
   After voting ended Saturday night, U.N. Special Representative
Martti Ahtisaari declared the balloting ``free and fair.''
   SWAPO on Monday agreed the elections were free but said they had
questions about the fairness. They said some ballot boxes that
arrived in Windhoek did not have the U.N. seal on them as required.
   Territorial election officials denied any irregularities.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Sunday that his
government will accept the results and ``is ready to work
constructively with the future government of Namibia.''
   He said the election ``ends the international dispute that has
raged for more than 40 years ... and which, aside from apartheid,
constituted the most important line of attack against South
Africa.''
   South Africa captured the territory from Germany in World War I
and ruled it under a League of Nations mandate subsequently
rescinded by the United Nations.
   South Africa refused U.N. orders to release the territory of
more than 1.3 million people until an agreement was signed in
December, which also provided for Cuban troops to leave neighboring
Angola.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's rightist Likud
bloc scored gains but failed to break the rival Labor Party's hold
over the national trade union federation in elections billed as a
referendum on Shamir's peace plan.
   Shamir had hoped a strong showing would strengthen his hand as
he heads for talks Wednesday with President Bush about Israel's
demand that the PLO be excluded from peace talks.
   According to national television projections, Likud garnered 28
percent of the vote compared to 22 percent four years ago in an
institution that has historically been a Labor Party stronghold.
   The left-leaning Labor, headed by Vice Premier Shimon Peres,
held onto its 55-percent majority in the 1.5 million-member
Histadrut Labor Federation, meaning it still maintains control over
the organization.
   Independent pollster Hanoch Smith predicted Labor would gain 56
percent of the votes and Likud 27 percent.
   Labor claimed victory, and one senior official said the results
were ``tremendously encouraging ... a turning point in the party's
morale.''
   But Likud leaders pointed out they had loosened some of Labor's
power base in the Histadrut, which governs Israeli labor policy and
also owns a significant chunk of Israeli farms and industries.
   The television said its projections were based on an exit poll
of 7,560 voters at 36 polling stations, with a margin of error of
two to three percent. Likud apparently gained from the losses of
three smaller left-wing parties.
   In past elections television projections have been accurate.
Final results were expected Tuesday morning.
   A stronger position in the labor federation also would help
Shamir defend his shaky coalition government against threats by
Peres to resign over peace policy and demand new elections.
   Peres claimed his party had made a comeback after losing
national elections to Likud last year.
   ``This shows the public has given renewed confidence to the
Labor Party and we will reach new heights,'' Peres told the
television. Labor favors making territorial concessions to the
Arabs for peace.
   In the union elections, 1,494,717 Israelis _ about half the
electorate _ were eligible to choose delegates to the Histadrut
Conference.
   Shamir made daily campaign speeches around the country, focusing
on foreign policy and Palestinian violence in the 23-month-old
uprising against Israeli rule.
   He warned repeatedly that talking to the Palestine Liberation
Organization or yielding any of the West Bank or Gaza Strip to the
Arabs would be ``national suicide,'' and urged support for his own
peace plan, introduced last April.
   The U.S.-backed Israeli plan calls for holding elections in the
disputed lands as part of an interim peace settlement. Arabs have
balked at accepting the idea because they want the PLO to represent
them in negotiations.
   Likud and Labor formed a coalition after inconclusive elections
in 1984 and did the same last year, when Likud won one more seat
than Labor in the 120-member parliament but neither won a majority.
   Histadrut, the Hebrew word for union, was founded in 1920 and
has continued to be Labor's domain despite the rise to power of
Likud in 1977.
   Most Likud supporters favor a free-market economy and shun the
Histadrut because of its socialist institutions.

<TEXT>
   Two Colombians pleaded guilty
Monday to smuggling 1,100 pounds of cocaine into Canada and each
was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison.
   Jose Ali Galindo Escobar, 36, and Fernando Augusto Mendoza
Jaramillo, 27, entered the guilty pleas as their trial was about to
begin on charges of importing cocaine and possession for the
purpose of trafficking.
   They admitted they were flying a small plane carrying the
cocaine from Colombia to an airstrip in rural New Brunswick north
of Fredericton when the craft's landing gear clipped the top of a
tree and they made a crash-landing.
   They were arrested by Royal Canadian Mounted Police who had been
alerted by their investigation that the drug shipment would be
made. Fredericton is 50 miles northeast of the Maine border.
   Justice David Russell, in sentencing the two men, called them
lawbreakers who brought a cargo of drugs into Canada without
concern for the misery and crime it would create. It was the
largest amount of cocaine ever seized in Canada.
   During presentence testimony, the court was told that Colombia's
Medellin cocaine cartel planned to use New Brunswick as a
distribution base for its North American operations.
   Police Corp. Gary LeGresley said the scheme was approved by
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, considered by the U.S. Justice
Department as a major kingpin in the Medellin cartel.
   Police testified that some of the cocaine found aboard the plane
was destined for Toronto and Montreal but nearly 900 pounds was to
be smuggled to New York.

   A police spokesman estimated the crowd of protesters at 2,000

   A spokesman for the National Union of Students said the honorary

   Weinberger, 62, was not hit by any of the eggs or tomatoes as he

awarded him the honorary law degree. A bag of flour landed within
yards of the duchess.
   Leeds University students, staff and supporters of the Campaign

   Weinberger was defense secretary from 1981 to 1987 during the

   A 17-year-old boy was shot to death in a hallway
in a public school Monday, the first killing in a city school in
more than a decade, authorities said.
   Alexander Stephens was shot once in the chest in a second-floor
hallway at Alfred E. Smith High School in the Bronx, said Detective
Vincent Jones.
   He died on the way to Lincoln Hospital, Jones said.
   Police were questioning a suspect, and the handgun used in the
shooting was recovered, Jones said.
   The shooting occurred between class periods near an exit.
Stephens, a pupil, had been in an argument with another student,
Officer Laura Power said. The shooter fled.
   ``People heard a shot at close range,'' said Gloria Lesser, a
spokeswoman for the Board of Education. Though details were
sketchy, ``it seems that there were two witnesses who the police
were interrogating.''
   The city operates metal detectors at the entrances to 15 of its
more troubled schools to keep students from bringing in weapons.
Smith, which has about 1,500 pupils, does not have a detector.
   Lesser said the last killing inside a city school was a fatal
stabbing in an annex to John Adams High School in Queens in the
early 1970s.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration held out the prospect
of stepped-up trade and diplomatic ties with East Germany on
Monday, while top Democrats in Congress called for far more
dramatic steps to signal support for the stunning reform
developments in the Communist world.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell urged President Bush to
travel to the Berlin Wall, convene a meeting of the Western allies
and suspend trade barriers against the Soviet Union.
   ``To acknowledge the tremendous significance of the symbolic
destruction of the Berlin Wall and to give voice to the
exhilaration felt by all Americans, I urge President Bush to travel
to West Berlin,'' said Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Administration officials who declined to be identified said Bush
was considering the convocation of a NATO summit in Brussels, after
his saltwater summit meeting on Dec. 2-3 with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, to discuss new political and military
strategy for the West.
   One administration official flashed two less dramatic signals.
He said the administration might boost trade with East Germany,
which totaled $220 million in 1988, and hold more frequent meetings
with East German diplomats.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater hailed the ``glorious''
traffic of more than 1 million East Germans streaming into West
Berlin to catch a glimpse of freedom, but said, concerning the
possibility that Bush might rush to the wall, ``We can't foresee
any set of circumstances at this moment that would induce him to
go.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle, meanwhile, said German reunification
was inevitable.
   ``East Germany is East Germany because of the Communist
system,'' Quayle told the Republican Governors Association at
Hilton Head Island, S.C. ``Do away with the Communist system and
it's Germany.''
   But the caution shown by Bush and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III amid last week's burst of new freedom in what was once a
rigid Stalinist state still permeated public and private statements
by U.S. policy makers.
   The U.S. government is not likely to take significant action
``until there are elections,'' said one official. ``You'd have to
see something like that happen before we would do something serious
other than to send friendly signals to the East Germans,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``If you are talking about assistance like we're giving to
Poland and Hungary, that's inappropriate,'' the official said.
   West Germany, to which the administration is deferring on most
East German decisions, is taking the same approach.
   Apart from holding elections, the official cited three
additional conditions for U.S. help. First is that the East Germans
do not backtrack on the announcement last Thursday that
restrictions on emigration and travel to the West had ended.
   Additionally, he said, East Germany must settle claims against
it by the Jewish community that derive from Germany's murder of 6
million European Jews during World War II and also compensate
Americans whose property was seized by the postwar Communist regime.
   ``These amount to several hundred million dollars each,'' the
official said. ``That's not a big thing but they are a big obstacle
in our relationship.''
   Quayle, meanwhile, rebutted Democratic accusations that the Bush
administration was slow in responding to the change sweeping
Eastern and Central Europe. He charged that ``the Democrats haven't
offered one creative idea on how to manage the evolving situation
in Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union except to criticize the
president.''
   House Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt renewed the
criticism Quayle was talking about, saying, ``At the very time
freedom and democracy are receiving standing ovations in Europe,
our president is sitting politely in the audience with little to
say and even less to contribute.''
   Separately, a dozen liberal congressmen said the changes sweping
Eastern Europe give the United States the chance to shift defense
spending to domestic programs.
   Members of the group, led by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., told a
news conference that the level of U.S. spending and its military
presence facing the Soviet Bloc can no longer be justified.
   ``What you see emerging here is a coalition of people who want
to talk about realities,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. ``This
is our opening shot and we're going to be tough on the budget this
year. ... This is hardball politics.''
   While the quickening pace of change is pushing East Germany onto
the Bush-Gorbachev agenda, the White House and State Department
sought to dampen speculation the two leaders might settle the
country's future.
   Presidential spokesman Fitzwater told reporters at the White
House that ``we do not intend to have this emerge as a second
Yalta.'' He referred to the Black Sea meeting in 1945 in which
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill and Soviet leader Josef Stalin deliberated on the postwar
future of Europe.
   Other U.S. officials said Bush would be prepared for an overture
by Gorbachev to consider the prospect of a reunified, neutral
Germany. But the officials stressed that Moscow had not signaled
through diplomatic channels that was the Soviet leader's intention
for the shipboard meetings with Bush in the Mediterranean.
   In any event, U.S. policy on East Germany is to act in concert
with the West Europeans rather than to take the lead, especially on
the reunification issue.
   Baker was in touch over the weekend with British and French
officials, and when Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to West
Germany, met Sunday in Bonn with Soviet ambassador Vyacheslav
Kochemasov he also represented Britain and France, said Richard
Boucher, the State Department spokesman.
   As the Senate resumed debate on an aid package to Poland and
Hungary, just hours before the arrival of Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa, Democratic leader Mitchell said a meeting of the Western
alliance is essential.
   ``It is widely recognized there has begun a process of
transforming the political, economic and security arrangements on
the European continent,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Somali government, battling
insurgencies in the north and south, is seeking peace talks and
amending the constitution to allow more political parties, a
Cabinet minister said.
   Foreign Minister Abd Al-Rahman Jama Barreh made the announcement
over the weekend in an interview broadcast by government radio in
Somalia's northwestern neighbor, Djibouti.
   ``The Somali government has decided to invite all those who hold
different views from ours to come and have talks with the
government,'' Radio Djibouti, monitored in Nairobi, quoted Barreh
as saying.
   Barreh, who was in Djibouti for talks with President Hassan
Gouled, said the multiparty system of government was not alien to
Somalia.
   He said the Horn of Africa nation had 88 political groups before
President Siad Barre seized power in a coup in October 1969.
   ``We are now involved in amending the constitution in order to
make provisions for the formation of (other) parties and to
establish ways in which they can compete in elections,'' Barreh
said.
   The Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party, formed in 1976, is
Somalia's only legal political organization.
   Barreh did not specify when the talks might take place or say if
any dissident group had responded to the government's invitation.
   The government tolerates no opposition and most critics have
been killed, detained, fled the country or joined the rebels.
   Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, have
accused Barre's government of human rights violations including
torture, indefinite detention without trial, unfair trials and
executions without trial.
   One of the government's strongest opponents is the Somali
National Movement of insurgents in the north who have been fighting
for Barre's ouster since 1981.
   The movement announced in a clandestine radio broadcast Saturday
that its fighters had cut the main road connecting northern Somalia
with the capital, Mogadishu.
   Another previously unknown group calling itself the Somali
Patriotic Movement has in recent months been fighting government
troops in southern Somalia.

<TEXT>
   Record prices were paid for works by 11 artists
Monday as Christie's sold 85 sculptures, paintings and drawings
collected by director and screenwriter Billy Wilder, the auction
house said.
   The diverse collection of Impressionist and modern works brought
$32.6 million, Christie's said. The highest price, $4.84 million,
was paid for a 1921 pastel by Pablo Picasso, ``Classic Head of a
Woman,'' which was not a record.
   Among the artists whose works sold for record prices were
Balthus, whose oil painting ``La Toilette'' brought $2.09 million;
Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, whose oil painting ``Two Nudes on a Sofa''
went for $1.54 million; and Marino Marini, whose bronze sculpture,
``Little Rider,'' sold for $671,000, the auction house said.
   Record prices were paid for eight lesser-known artists.
   Other notable items included ``The Farmer and His Wife,'' a Joan
Miro painting that sold for $2.695 million, and Joseph Cornell's
untitled pharmacy box, a 14-inch-by-13-inch cabinet filled with
apothecary jars, which sold for $495,000.
   The Austrian-born Wilder, 83, who directed films like ``The Lost
Weekend,'' ``Sunset Boulevard,'' ``Double Indemnity'' and ``Some
Like it Hot,'' watched the auction.
   ``We were really excited because we could share this with Billy
Wilder,'' said Doris Athineos, a Christie's spokeswoman. ``Usually
our collectors aren't present for the sales but we could really see
the expression on his face when his works brought nice prices.
   ``He said he wanted to be alive when they sold his collection,
that he wanted to have fun and he wanted to see it,'' she said.

   The three major networks ran evening news

there first, helping NBC bounce back from its embarrassing early
coverage of the San Francisco earthquake.
   On Friday night, ABC's Peter Jennings and CBS' Dan Rather were

a chunk of broken Berlin Wall in front of cheering Berliners for a

   Jennings and Rather flew to Berlin from New York after their
Thursday newscasts.
   Meanwhile, NBC affiliates received a six-page letter from NBC
News president Michael Gartner explaining what went wrong with the
network's quake coverage on Oct. 17 and what has been done to
correct problems that arose.
   Although it later drew praise for its all-night coverage of the

that a second freeway had collapsed in the quake.

<HEAD>No Cameras for Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has reaffirmed its
opposition to permitting cameras in its courtroom.
   In an Oct. 27 letter to a lawyer representing a group of news
organizations, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said a majority
of the court's nine members remains opposed to still and television
cameras in their courtroom.
   The lawyer, Timothy B. Dyk, said Nov. 8 that he is disappointed
but remains hopeful the justices will change their mind. ``It won't
happen now. But I hope it will happen one day,'' he said.
   Dyk arranged a demonstration one year ago of how television
cameras could operate in the high court's stately and ornate
chamber.
   Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Byron R. White
observed the demonstration, in which a small video camera was
placed in an alcove to focus on the justices and a second camera
was directed at the area lawyers stand to argue their cases.
   Rehnquist's letter to Dyk did not offer any explanation for the
justices' decision, nor did it specify which members opposed
cameras in the court.
   But court sources have said some justices were turned against TV
coverage by the televised Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on
Robert H. Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court. Bork's nomination
was rejected by the Senate.
   The U.S. Judicial Conference, the federal courts' policy-making
arm headed by Rehnquist, has enforced a ban on electronic and still
photographic coverage in all federal courts.
   Still and TV cameras are allowed in state court proceedings in
44 states.

<HEAD>NBC Paying $600 Million for Rights to NBA Games</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC took the NBA away from CBS on Nov. 9 with a
$600 million, four-year contract.
   The NBA is in the final season of a four-year, $173 million deal
with CBS, which refused to meet the league's new pricetag.
   The new pact was another example of the price escalation for TV
sports and of the breakup of traditional alliances between leagues
and networks. Baseball, which had been on NBC since 1947, goes to
CBS starting in 1990 under a four-year, $1.06 billion deal. The
Olympics, once a domain of ABC, will remain on NBC and CBS through
at least 1994.
   NBC, which last broadcast the NBA in 1962, lost its baseball
package to CBS last December.
   CBS, which had broadcast the NBA since the 1973-74 season, had
the right to exclusive negotiations with the league during October.
CBS was offered the same $600 million deal, but turned it down.
   Under the contract, NBC will show 20 regular-season games, the
All-Star Game and up to 30 playoff games.
   The NBA will now negotiate a new cable television contract to
replace the two-year, $50 million deal with Turner Broadcasting
Systems that expires at the end of the season.

   A commercial television station and a
public TV station hope to introduce the first all-news station
operated by local TV stations anywhere in the nation.
   KRON-TV, the local NBC affiliate, plans to launch the joint
venture with public station KQED in March. Tentatively called the
Bay News Center, the all-news station would be broadcast on Channel
32.
   The plan still must be approved by KQED's board of directors,
which is scheduled to vote Dec. 7, KQED President Anthony Tiano
said. KQED Inc. has broadcast licenses for Channels 9 and 32.
   A potential roadblock is an FCC review board ruling last year
that denied KQED a renewal of its license to operate Channel 32.
The ruling has been appealed to the full FCC.
   ``We've been looking for a way to get back into TV news,'' said
Tiano, whose station had a daily local newscast during the 1970s
but recently canceled its only regularly scheduled local public
affairs program.
   KRON, owned by Chronicle Broadcasting Co., had been seeking
since May to start a cable TV channel that focuses on regional
news, general manager Amy McCombs said.
   Viewers without cable would see newscasts without commercials,
executives at KRON and KQED said. Commercials would be added when
the station's signal was received by a cable operator and
distributed to subscribers' homes.

   New Hampshire primary watchers, always wary
of threats to their state's earliest-in-the-nation presidential
primary, have turned their eyes westward toward the
biggest-in-the-nation: California.
   Rich, hip and populated, California is tired of having little

usually have been chosen long before Californians vote in June.
   Come January, legislators in the delegate-loaded state will
reconsider a proposal to move the state's primary to early March,
shortly after New Hampshire's.
   Will California's 27 million people mute New Hampshire's 1
million? Will its multiple media markets lure commentators'
attention from the grass roots, person-to-person struggle here?
   ``Absolutely not. It will have just the opposite effect,'' said

primary.'' State Democratic Chairman Joseph Grandmaison and his

<HEAD>Young British Director ``Descending'' on New York Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a man who was tearing tickets at a West End
theater just a few years ago, 28-year-old director Tim Luscombe is
getting some impressive exposure.
   He is shepherding two London hits to New York this season, and
will direct Joan Collins' return to the London stage next year. Tom
Stoppard's ``Artist Descending a Staircase'' starts Broadway
performances Nov. 22 at the Helen Hayes Theater for a Nov. 30 bow.
Martin Sherman's ``When She Danced'' follows off-Broadway at
Playwrights' Horizons, where performances begin Jan. 25, 1990.
   ``There is no point in being in this business if you're not
directing plays you actually adore and have a real feeling for,''
said Luscombe, an Oxford University graduate.
   The pressured Broadway environment couldn't be more different
from the relaxed intimacy of The King's Head, the north London pub
theater where these productions originated.
   But Luscombe said higher stakes don't daunt him: ``If I started
thinking, `Oh God, what does a Broadway audience want from this
scene?' I would just go bananas.
   ``I can't ever think in terms of an audience; I do it for me.
The more you trust your instincts, the more successful you will be.
Also, how do I know what a Broadway audience wants? I've seen five
shows on Broadway, entirely musicals.''
   Broadway has traditionally warmed to Stoppard, the Czech-born
master of wordplay who won Tony awards for ``Travesties,''
``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'' and ``The Real Thing.''
   His screenplays include ``Empire of the Sun,'' ``Brazil'' and
John Le Carre's ``The Russia House,'' now in production.
   ``Artist Descending a Staircase'' began as a radio play in 1972.
Written in 11 scenes covering 58 years, the play is organized
symmetrically around Scene 6 so that the action goes backward to
1914 only to reverse directions and end up where it started.
   It's about three aging artists, played by John McMartin, Paxton
Whitehead and Harold Gould, who decades earlier fought for the
affections of a young blind girl (Stephanie Roth).
   Its punning Stoppardian title pays homage to ``Nude Descending a
Staircase,'' Marcel Duchamp's 1911-12 Dadaist painting which, like
Stoppard's brief 80-minute play, is an exercise in perspective.
   Luscombe said it was ``a difficult play to do, but it's like a
poem. ... It's as beautiful and as taut as a poem.''
   He first read the play as a set text for his high school art
studies: ``I believe it saved my exam. It inspired me hugely.''
   When he set out to stage it, he tried changing the radio format
but ended up going back to the original and didn't change a word.
   ``People seemed to think it was as good a theater piece as it
was a radio piece,'' Luscombe said.
   He said the play has an emotional directness not always found in
Stoppard, whose latest London play, ``Hapgood,'' was dismissed by
some as cold and obscure.
   ``It has more to do with the heart than with the head,'' he
said. ``It is an intensely passionate piece.''
   ``When She Danced,'' his other New York play, marks the first
time the esteemed non-profit theater Playwrights' Horizons has
employed a foreign director, Luscombe said.
   The play, set in Paris late in the career of dancer Isadora
Duncan, is by Martin Sherman, the London-based American author of
``Bent'' and ``Messiah.''
   Luscombe grew up in the south London suburbs and, after Oxford,
spent a year teaching at a north London boys' school. He quit to
work in a theater box office and tear tickets, then studied
directing at the Bristol Old Vic Theater School.
   He made his London reputation staging 20th-century English
classics such as Noel Coward's little-known ``Easy Virtue,'' and
Terence Rattigan's ``The Browning Version.''
   Next autumn, he returns to the West End to stage Coward's 1930
``Private Lives'' with Joan Collins of TV's ``Dynasty'' as the
elegantly barbed Amanda.
   He regards Coward, who died in 1973, as Britain's Chekhov, and
says of Collins' return to the boards: ``She'll be wonderful.''

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While communist leaders
elsewhere are grappling with public discontent, the outlawed South
African Communist Party is gaining wide notice and unabashed
support.
   Because of President F.W. de Klerk's decision to ease
restrictions on anti-government protest, the communists' symbols
and rhetoric have emerged from the political underground into the
media spotlight.
   At a mass rally in October for freed leaders of the African
National Congress guerrilla movement, the Communist Party's red
flag and the ANC's gold, green and black banner were given equal
prominence as huge backdrops to the speakers' podium.
   A roar came from the mostly black crowd of more than 70,000 when
a message was read from the party's general secretary, Joe Slovo,
an exiled white lawyer who is depicted by the government as a
mastermind of terrorist attacks. The rally's keynote speech,
delivered by the 77-year-old ANC leader Walter Sisulu, ended with
an unmistakable message:
   ``Long live the ANC! Long live our alliance with the South
African Communist Party! Long live the working class movement!''
   The party's new stature comes at a time when its counterparts
are in varying degrees of retreat not only in Eastern Europe, but
also in Africa. The trend among leftist governments on the
Continent is to move away from dogmatic Marxism-Leninism and seek
expanded economic ties with the West.
   But in South Africa, communism holds a particular appeal for
sections of the disenfranchised black majority who view capitalism
as a partner of apartheid.
   The party has not issued a detailed platform on how it would run
the country. However, it has never publicly repudiated any aspect
of orthodox Marxism-Leninism and refers to Western countries as
imperialist.
   The Communist Party ``retains a romantic mystique ... to the
young lions who are searching for a revolutionary alternative to
the status quo,'' The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper,
said in a recent analysis. ``It has a vision and an ideological
coherence.''
   Some commentators have suggested that this mystique could be
lessened if the government lifted the ban on the party and let its
leaders compete openly in the ideological marketplace. As yet,
there has been no sign this might happen.
   ``Let me state it unequivocally,'' said Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok in a speech Nov. 2. ``Communism is unacceptable to me,
it is unacceptable to the South African government and the large
majority of people in our country.''
   Some anti-apartheid church leaders have expressed dismay that
communist banners were displayed at recent protest marches they had
led. Yet many activist clergymen discomfited by communism's atheism
are sympathetic to the ANC, which uses as its anthem a moving hymn,
``God Bless Africa.''
   The ANC-Communist alliance dates to the early 1920s, when both
campaigned for black workers. The Communist Party was banned in
1950, and the ANC in 1960, and leaderhip has overlapped extensively
within the two exiled organizations.
   In 1986, the U.S. State Department estimated that about half of
the ANC's executive committee members were communists.
   Govan Mbeki, one of the released ANC leaders honored at the
October rally, said in his speech that the ANC-Communist alliance
has been a prime target of the South African government and ``its
supporters in the imperialist countries.''
   He declared that the alliance ``is going to continue until
apartheid ... is eliminated.''
   Few details about the Communist Party, including its size and
the composition of its politburo, are known. The ANC operates
clandestinely inside South Africa, and its guerrillas periodically
are arrested, but no evidence has turne up of comparable internal
activity by the communists.
   The most recent policy statement issued by the party takes a
more hardline stance than the ANC on the possibility of
negotiations with the government.
   ``Seizure of power will be the product of escalating and
progressively merging mass political and military struggle, with
the likelihood of culminating in an insurrection,'' said a document
adopted at a party congress earlier this year. ``We are not engaged
in a struggle whose objective is merely to generate sufficient
pressure to bring the other side to the bargaining table.''

   Under the presidency of Julio M.
Sanguinetti, Uruguay's economy expanded, its employment rate
increased and workers' wages have risen. Yet as he prepares to
leave office his popularity is at an all-time low and the main
opposition party is poised for victory in the presidential election
this Sunday.
   ``There is a great sense of dissatisfaction in the country,''
the political analyst and pollster Luis Gonzalez said. ``If you
compare Uruguay with Argentina or Brazil, Uruguay has done well.
But that doesn't satisfy Uruguayans.''
   Sanguinetti, however, feels a sense of accomplishment.
   ``I think many things were done,'' he said in an interview.
``Above all, a descent into the bad things that characterize these
times on this continent was avoided.''
   Since he took office in March 1985, Sanguinetti has watched
neighboring Brazil sink deep into foreign debt, Venezuela face
riots, Argentina almost collapse under hyperinflation, and Peru
bleed in a guerrilla insurgency.
   Uruguay, with a population of just 2.9 million, has not been
free of the ills that plague its neighbors, but never did problems
overwhelm resources, undermine democracy or touch off violence.
   ``I would say, yes, the country is better after Sanguinetti,''
said Jorge Lanzara, director of the political science faculty at
the University of the Republic.
   Sanguinetti's critics say his economic gains shine only in
comparison with the recession of the early 1980s. His supporters
say he was kept from doing better by opposition in Congress.
   ``He provided peace, democracy and some economic growth,'' said
Gladys Presa, 59. ``I say, `Thank you, Dr. Sanguinetti.' In my
opinion, he did a very good job.''
   The polling agency Equipos Consultores recently gauged
Sanguinetti's public approval rating at 22 percent, down from a
high four years ago of nearly 70 percent.
   Equipos Consultores and the Gallup organization both project
that Luis Lacalle of the opposition National Party will defeat
Jorge Batlle of Sanguinetti's Colorado Party in the balloting.
   Sanguinetti, a 53-year-old attorney and career politician,
professes to be disturbed neither by the polls nor by labor unrest
that has resulted in strikes by teachers, garbage collectors, dock
workers and other public employees in recent weeks.
   ``Politics is not a thing of momentary popularity,'' he said.
   ``The main criticism they make of me is that I limited myself to
being the administrator of a crisis, that I was not a reformer.
Well, I accept that.''
   Political observers say Sanguinetti's accomplishments fell short
of public expectations because the economic improvements came
nowhere near to restoring the prosperity Uruguay had from the turn
of the century through the 1950s _ the years when it was known as
the Switzerland of South America.
   Public services that once were run with exceptional efficiency
now function poorly. Classrooms are overcrowded, teachers are
underpaid, hospitals and clinics are outdated, and retirement
pensions are paltry.
   Critics describe Sanguinetti's treatment of opposition parties
in Congress as high-handed, his support of amnesty for former
military rulers as overly aggressive, and his backing of Vice
President Enrique Tarigo over Batlle in the Colorado presidential
primary as meddling.
   ``He didn't make any mistakes until he said publicly he made no
mistakes,'' Lanzara said. ``Then he lost the Colorado primary.
There is a certain arrogance in him. He thought if he told Batlle
not to run, he wouldn't.''
   Even political opponents concede, however, that any accounting
of Sanguinetti's term must note he is honest, hard-working,
intelligent and eloquent.
   ``I believe he is the best of American presidents, north or
south,'' Lacalle was quoted as saying in a published interview.
   Sanguinetti is barred by the constitution from seeking a
consecutive term. While he refuses to speculate whether he'll run
again in 1994, the assumption is that he will.

<HEAD>After California Quake, Egyptians Wonder About Aswan High Dam</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Earthquakes in the past disfigured one of
Ramses II's colossal faces at Abu Simbel in southern Egypt, toppled
Alexandria's Pharos Lighthouse and destroyed some of Cairo's most
beautiful mosques.
   But they've failed to faze the oldest of the great monuments,
the Giza pyramids or, so far, the newest, Gamal Abdul Nasser's
Aswan High Dam, which began operating in 1971.
   In October, when the killer earthquake struck northern
California, followed by another closer to home in Algeria,
Egyptians began to worry about the High Dam's safety.
   Seventeen times the size of Cheops' Great Pyramid, the
Soviet-built Aswan is the world's largest rock-filled dam and it
holds back the world's second largest man-made lake, 310-mile-long
Lake Nasser.
   A serious breach of the dam would send a huge wall of water _ an
estimated 110 billion gallons _ roaring through the Nile River
valley, where almost all Egypt's 55 million people live.
   Rushing toward the Mediterranean Sea, it would sweep away much
of ancient and modern Egypt and reach Cairo in three days.
   ``When I'm asked if the Aswan High Dam is safe from earthquakes,
I can say it is, up to magnitude 7 on the Richter scale, because
we've made a mock-up of the dam and tested it,'' said geophysicist
R.M. Kebeasy, Egypt's leading dam expert.
   ``Even if an earthquake were to occur beneath the dam itself, it
would withstand it to this level. Still, we're taking no chances.
We monitor seismic activity 24 hours a day.''
   On Nov. 14, 1981, a 5.6 quake centered 40 miles to the south of
the dam and a series of aftershocks startled Aswan's residents.
   It was the strongest in living memory at Aswan, and all of Egypt
shared Aswan's concern.
   ``Even though this earthquake was not a major concern for us, we
took earthquakes seriously from that time,'' Kebeasy said. Within
months Egypt had its first seismic station at Aswan, equipped with
U.S.-supplied equipment and advisers.
   Pressure on the dam and the surrounding geology is daunting.
   Every year for eons, an estimated 134 million tons of sediment
made its way down the Nile to the sea. Now it is captured behind
the dam, adding that much more weight to the lakebed.
   Water levels and pressure shift constantly, accommodating
differences in wind direction, flow northward from Sudan,
temperature and other factors.
   Kebeasy said geologists weren't at all surprised when
earthquakes started occurring as the lake began to fill.
   ``We thought the largest ones would appear when water is
highest,'' he said. ``They don't. The strongest ones coincide with
drought.''
   He predicts that earthquake activity will diminish as the dam
area conditions itself to its new geological feature: a huge lake.
   But other experts, such as Boston University's Egyptian-born
Farouk el-Baz, advise caution.
   ``You have an immense weight of water, and you have water
seeping through faults acting as a lubricant,'' he said. ``People
should neither sit around worrying about it nor forget it. You have
to be on the alert.''
   An early critic of the dam was geologist Farkhonda Hassan, a
former member of parliament, now a professor at American University
in Cairo.
   She and others still question whether the Aswan earthquakes are
caused by the weight of the lake or, more dangerously, by faults
like the San Andreas that caused the California quake that measured
7.1.
   The dam was built, she noted, in Nasser's time.
   ``You couldn't criticize. If you did you were branded a bad
Egyptian,'' she added.
   ``There were scientists in Egypt willing and able to do in-depth
geological surveys of the area, but we weren't included.
   ``I believe the dam would have been built anyway, but I would
like to have seen it built with more science.''

   Today is Friday, Nov. 24, the 328th day of 1989. There are 37
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Nov. 24, 1859, British naturalist Charles Darwin published
``On the Origin of Species,'' a paper in which he explained his
theory of evolution through the process of natural selection.
   On this date:
   In 1784, Zachary Taylor, the 12th president of the United
States, was born in Orange County, Va.
   In 1863, the Civil War battle for Lookout Mountain began in
Tennessee. Union forces succeeded in taking the mountain two days
later.
   In 1864, French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was born in
Albi.
   In 1871, the National Rifle Association was incorporated, and
its first president named: Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside.
   In 1944, U.S. bombers based on Saipan attacked Tokyo in what was
the first raid against the Japanese capital by land-based planes.
   In 1947, a group of motion picture writers, producers and
directors who came to be known as the ``Hollywood Ten'' were cited
for contempt of Congress because of their refusal to answer
questions about alleged Communist influence in the movie business.

the second manned mission to the moon.
   In 1971, a hijacker identified as ``Dan Cooper'' parachuted from
a Northwest Airlines 727 over Washington state with $200,000
dollars in ransom. The skyjacker has never been heard from since.
   In 1985, 58 people died when Egyptian forces stormed a hijacked
Egyptair jetliner parked on the ground at Valletta, Malta.
   In 1987, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to scrap
shorter-and medium-range missiles in the first superpower treaty to
eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons.
   Ten years ago: President Carter conferred with his military
advisers at Camp David, Md., as the Iran hostage crisis entered its
fourth week.
   Five years ago: A tragic mix-up came to light in Sioux City,
Iowa, as 16-year-old Patricia Noonan, who was injured in a bus-car
collision two weeks earlier, emerged from a coma: She had been
mistakenly identified as her friend, 14-year-old Shawn Lake, who
died in the accident and was buried under the wrong name.
   One year ago: South Africa's justice minister announced that
black leader Nelson Mandela wouldn't be returned to prison upon his
recovery from tuberculosis, but would instead remain in custody in
another location.
   Today's Birthdays: Producer-writer Garson Kanin is 77. Actor
Howard Duff is 72. Columnist William F. Buckley is 64. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater is 47.

<TEXT>
   London is undergoing its biggest transformation
since it climbed out of the rubble of World War II.
   From the East End and King's Cross to the westerly Thames-side
districts of Chelsea, Fulham and Putney, vast tracts of the capital
are changing as the post-industrial age overtakes Britain.
   ``When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life,'' Dr.
Samuel Johnson once wrote. But today, the great 18th century
wordsmith might have trouble finding his way around. His house off
Fleet Street still stands, but otherwise, in a sense London's very
center of gravity is shifting.
   Fleet Street is no longer the main street for newspaper offices.
Covent Garden, where Eliza Doolittle sold her flowers, is a chic,
modern shopping and eating mall. The once seedy East End and
Hackney are becoming yuppie country. Soho is losing its strip
joints and going classy.
   The 121-mile Orbital, the world's longest beltway, was completed
three years ago and is opening up new suburbs for Londoners who can
no longer afford skyrocketing house prices.
   At the same time, the nostalgia boom is bringing back
suburbanites to the inner cities in search of old Georgian and
Victorian properties to refurbish, and DIY _ do-it-yourself _ is
Britain's biggest hobby after TV-gazing.
   The Docklands, once the world's largest shipping hub, is now
Europe's biggest urban renewal project, although struggling with
traffic and start-up problems. Rundown King's Cross in the heart of
the capital will soon get a similar facelift with the bulldozing of
135 acres of decayed Georgian and Victorian buildings, railroad
sidings and warehouses.
   King's Cross may become the terminus of the rail tunnel being
dug to link Britain and France, and high-speed trains thundering up
from the English Channel promise yet more profound change for
London.
   The entrepreneurial forces unleashed by a decade of government
by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservatives, are
evident in this ``flower of cities all,'' as the 16th century poet
William Dunbar called it.
   ``There's a fantastic amount of money about after 10 years of
Mrs. Thatcher's enterprise culture and lots more has come to London
from abroad because developers consider Britain a safe bet,'' said
realtor Joss Macleod.
   ``Thatcherism is reflected in the lifestyle,'' he added.
``London is hotting up in all walks of life. It's faster now. The
English reserve has been replaced in part by a lot more energy and
drive and it's driven a lot of Londoners into the country.''
   There is also a growing homelessness problem. The government
puts the number at 23,000. Shelter, a charity, puts the number
nearer 40,000.
   Some things, of course, never change: Big Ben, still keeping
time, precisely; taxi drivers, who can still refuse to go beyond
the six-mile limit set in Victorian times to spare the horses;
London's three royal palaces, five great parks and timeless
landmarks, such as St. Paul's Cathedral and Nelson's Column.
   It's still a quiet, good-natured city where the emphasis is on
community, and children do most things at half-price. At night
London retires to pubs or clubs, empties out into its suburbs, goes
to bed early and eschews ostentation. No. 10 Downing St., the prime
minister's address, is just an ordinary door with a policeman
outside.
   The development boom uncovers extraordinary relics: the
foundations of William Shakespeare's Globe and Rose theaters at
Southwark; prehistoric flints and arrowheads by Waterloo train
station; a Saxon settlement under the Strand; a Tudor workman's hat
near London Bridge.
   London has a population of 6.7 million, plus 21 million tourists
a year, but no mayor; indeed, the City of London means no more than
the business district, which has a figurehead Lord Mayor whose writ
doesn't run outside its square mile.
   The rest of the capital is the sum of its 32 boroughs, each
independent, with no over-arching authority to solve critical
problems of traffic congestion and litter.
   The left-led Greater London Council was abolished in 1986 as
part of Mrs. Thatcher's crusade against socialism. And now ``London
looks out of control,'' says Judy Hillman, an urban affairs
consultant and author of ``A New Look for London.'' ``... It's
divide and rule with 33 fiefdoms and no forum for debating
London-wide issues.''
   Fleet Street, until a few years ago synonymous with newspapers,
is deader than yesterday's headline now that publishers have moved
to new high-tech facilities in the Docklands and elsewhere.

   In the City, imposing Victorian counting houses jostle against
ultra-modern architecture, such as the glass-and-tube headquarters
of the Lloyd's insurance market.
   The great shopping boulevard of Oxford Street still attracts
shoppers from all over the world. But canny Londoners now head for
the new American-style malls like Brent Cross in north London, with
its thousands of free parking spaces.
   Harry Shepherd, 66, who heads the storekeepers' Oxford Street
Association, grew up in London's East End when it was poor and
tough, and regrets the decline of London's community spirit.
   ``It's because society itself has changed and become more
selfish,'' he said. ``One example is the way crowds on the tube
(subway) no longer stand aside to allow passengers to get off.''
   The subway system, the world's largest, is so crowded that it is
raising fares to reduce passenger loads, meaning more automobiles
clogging a road system so resistant to expansion that village lanes
become major thoroughfares.
   The real estate frenzy means rocketing land prices and rents,
with houses in Mayfair, Belgravia and Hampstead fetching up to $4.7
million.
   ``The center and the well-known areas like Chelsea and
Knightsbridge have become too expensive for anyone unless they
belong to the international network,'' said Miss Hillman.
   ``Londoners used to move very little. Now they are moving
everywhere.''
   On Savile Row, where the well-heeled get their suits at 1,000
pounds ($1,500) apiece, tailors have been deprived of their
light-industry status, exposing them to crippling rent hikes.
   The unsentimental Thatcher government has told the tailors to
adapt to market forces or ``go to Hounslow,'' a suburb 11 miles
away.
   The sex shops and massage parlors of once seedy but fascinating
Soho are being replaced by smart restaurants, shops and designer
offices. Gerard Street is the hub of a thriving Chinatown with
all-night eating houses. Nearby, the West End offers its endless
outpouring of musicals and quality drama.
   Some London traditionalists dislike the changes, Prince Charles
among them.
   The heir to the throne and self-appointed arbiter of British
architectural taste accuses postwar developers of doing more damage
to London than Hitler's air force.
   The writer and jazz singer George Melly, writing in The Guardian
newspaper, dismisses the current post-modernist school of
architecture as ``strip lighting and flickering computers visible
through the sash windows of a fake Georgian facade.''
   In the Soho he once loved, ``advertising agents, creatures of
the media, have ousted the painters, poets and eccentrics of my
salad days,'' he wrote.
   A lot of London character is being priced out by chain stores,
but Asian immigrants have rescued the news vending, candy and
greengrocery trades.
   ``London is a much more cosmopolitan city these days,'' Miss
Hillman said. ``Whitechapel, which was Jewish immigrant, is now
Bengali from Bangladesh. Brixton, Brent and Harringay are
Afro-Caribbean and so are bits of Notting Hill. Southall is Indian
and Newham is Asian.''

   Less pollution, more garbage and the decline of
heavy industry have brought wildlife to London.
   Squirrels abound in the parks, perching on trash cans at Marble
Arch to munch discarded sandwiches and lick candy papers.
   Crows strut in Hyde Park, contesting for fast food remnants with
the squirrels, pigeons, blackbirds and sparrows.
   Salmon, migrating from the sea, were caught in the Thames this
year, a tribute to two decades of pollution control.
   ``Foxes have moved in, rearing cubs on railroad embankments and
in derelict basements and finding food in streets and backyards,''
says Jeff Edwards, conservation officer at the London Wildlife
Trust.
   One of London's glories is its parks and wild open spaces. It's
also a gardener's city, in which almost every home has its green
backyard.
   Turning up in the unlikeliest inner city corners are the
ubiquitous allotments, small patches of land distributed to
retirees to raise vegetables and flowers. It's a vestige of World
War II, when the British were commanded to grow food on every
possible square foot of their island.
   Edwards said the 1956 Clean Air Act, prompted by killer smog,
stopped coal fires being burned in homes, cleaned the air and
improved the prospects for wildlife, although increased traffic
cancels out some of the gains.
   ``Kestrels are nesting in high places and preying on sparrows
where they used to eat small rodents in the country. Magpies were
once seen only in the country but are nesting in trees in the
streets and pinching the eggs of smaller birds, as well as
scavenging.
   ``Wildlife can't survive in bits of formal parkland _ it needs
wild places as well,'' he said.
   A prime example is Camley Street in King's Cross, where
volunteers cleared derelict land, dug ponds and then left nature to
create a remarkable patch of the wild in the midst of one of the
capital's seediest districts.
   ``It is wonderful for children in the heart of London to see
frogs, toads, newts and minnows a few yards from a busy street,''
Edwards said.
   But change has its price.
   The Camley Street park is under threat from its landlord,
British Rail, which needs room to expand.

   The Sorbonne, established as a center of learning
at a time when scholars risked being burned for sorcery, has shown
an uncanny knack for keeping its intellectual reputation despite
200 years of decline.
   ``Sorbonne is a magic word everywhere in the world because of
the tradition of intellectual excellence that it represents. It is
a symbol,'' said its rector, Michelle Gendreau-Massaloux, whose
travels on behalf of the university have taken her recently to
Boston, Berlin and Bombay.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union chose the
Sorbonne's amphitheater as the setting for meeting French
intellectuals; Chinese exiles gathered there to organize a new
movement for democracy. Millions of foreign visitors wouldn't
consider a trip to Paris complete without buying a ``Sorbonne
University'' sweatshirt, sold by independent entrepreneurs.
   But the reputation abroad is a long way from the reality at home.
   Top students regard today's Sorbonne as seedy and second-rate
and a wrong turn on the road to success in French government or
industry.
   The Sorbonne, founded more than 700 years ago, and the other
national universities are considered poor relations to the five
Grandes Ecoles, unabashedly elitist training grounds for the sons
and daughters of the well-heeled.
   Students train and compete like Olympic athletes for the 100,000
places available in the Grandes Ecoles. Unlike the state-run
university system that accommodates more than 1 million students,
the Grandes Ecoles offer smaller classes, better facilities and the
sort of lifelong networking typical of Oxford and Cambridge in
Britain or America's Ivy League.
   One-third of the leaders of France's 50 biggest companies come
from a single school, the Ecole Polytechnique. The Cabinets of
President Francois Mitterrand have been dominated by graduates of
the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, including Ms.
Gendreau-Massoloux, who was Mitterrand's spokeswoman before taking
the rector's job at the Sorbonne.
   The Sorbonne and other state universities must accept anyone who
has passed the difficult high school exit exam, the
``baccelaureat,'' and pays the annual tuition of 450 francs ($73).
As a result, the schools are overcrowded, underfinanced and suffer
a high dropout rate.
   ``Space is our biggest problem,'' said Ms. Gendreau-Massaloux.
``There are not enough tables or chairs, even books. We are
bursting at the seams.''
   Two thousand students stood in lines for hours this year hoping
for one of the 1,100 places available to study English and Spanish.
   Seats are hard to find in the Sorbonne's lofty library with the
beamed neo-Renaissance ceilings. Benches are scarce in the central
courtyard outside the Sorbonne Church, erected in 1642 and
containing the marble tomb of Cardinal Richelieu.
   Halls, lavatories and public spaces in the four-story building
on the Rue des Ecoles are jammed. More than 37,000 students,
including 6,000 foreigners, fill beyond capacity the school's 22
lecture halls, two museums, 16 examination halls, 22 lecture rooms,
37 rooms for the teaching staff, laboratories, a library, a physics
tower, an astronomy tower and offices.
   Faded allegorical murals, the gilded sundial and the sweeping
stairway at the entrance to the school may wow the tourists, but
French students are not impressed.
   They ranked the Sorbonne 18th on the list of 78 state-run
schools judged on ambiance, quality of instruction and job
prospects, in a poll conducted among 14,500 students this past
summer by the newspaper Le Monde.
   Sixty percent of the Sorbonne students polled doubted their
education would make it easier to find jobs.
   The beginning of the decline that has led to this sorry state
can be traced to the French Revolution in 1789 when the school lost
much of its status along with a precious library that was moved to
the National Archives.
   Napoleon dented the Sorbonne's prestige by setting up his own
school. In the early 19th century, Latin ceased to be the official
language of scholarship, and more specialized schools for the elite
opened their doors.
   Following the student riots of May 1968, the University of Paris
was reorganized into 13 mini-universities financed and administered
by the state. The Sorbonne building was allocated to house Paris
III and IV, schools of history, arts and letters and foreign
languages.
   Despite the changes in the school itself, the surrounding Left
Bank neighborhood remains the unchallenged domain of students.
   In the Sorbonne's early days, ``nations'' of young scholars,
distinguished from each other by marks of provincial dress and
accent, strolled along the banks of the Seine, arguing logic or
devising syllogisms.
   ``There were scores of hard-drinking English in fur-lined coats
and leather hose; brawling Germans in toploftical fur hats;
Burgundians brutal and thick-headed ... the native Franks, foppish
and arrogant ... Italians richly dressed in oriental stuffs,''
wrote historian Amy Kelly. ``The air of freedom prevailed, all
manner of instruction was provided.''
   At its founding in 1253, the Sorbonne was just one of several
schools allowed to open outside the confines and control of the
Roman Catholic school at Notre Dame.
   Robert de Sorbon, a chaplain for King Louis IX (St. Louis),
received permission to set up his college for 16 poor theology
students and it quickly gained an academic reputation that made it
the tallest tree in the leafy grove of academe.
   Young men came to study, just as they traveled to the other
great centers of learning at Bologna in Italy and Oxford in
England, where great masters opened up worlds of theology,
philosophy, logic, law, medicine and the arts. The concerns of the
quarter were intellectual, its life was controversy.
   It was a time of momentous events and heroic figures. Roger
Bacon, Thomas Beckett, Thomas Aquinas, the philosopher Peter
Abelard and his wife, Heloise, all were teaching or studying on the
rustic left bank of the Seine.
   Troubadours spread a new idea of romantic love. The Inquisition
spread its terror, searching and finding heretical ideas anywhere
new thought flourished.
   Sorbonne doctors rendered decisions on ecclesiastical and
theological debate for the pope, advised kings and administered
their own law independent of the throne.
   Barely a shadow of this greatness remains.
   ``Never mind the changes,'' Ms. Gendreau-Massaloux said.
``People still know the Sorbonne by its tradition as a refuge for
intellectuals, a place apart from political currents, a defender of
free expression against state and military power. The Sorbonne
still enjoys a great deal of prestige.''

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Health maintenance organizations are viewed as a
way to bring a measure of frugality to the sky's-the-limit world of
medicine. Reaching this goal has often meant tying doctors' incomes
to the cost of their bedside decisions. In this latest story in a
continuing series, ``The Business of Medicine,'' Science Writer
Daniel Q. Haney and National Writer Fred Bayles look at how some
HMOs use financial incentives to encourage doctors to limit care.

   Many health maintenance organizations attract
patients with promises of low fees and broad coverage, but they
fail to point out one financial detail: Their doctors can often
fatten their pay by skimping on care.
   In fact, at many HMOs, a simple rule of economics prevails. The
less their doctors do, the more money they make.
   ``Many physicians have run across situations where pretty
horrifying things happened because it looked as though a doctor was
withholding service because of the HMO financial incentives,'' said
Dr. Douglas F. Levinson, a psychiatrist at the Medical College of
Pennsylvania.
   Payments vary dramatically among these popular medical plans;
not all offer strong rewards for miserly care. For instance, some
of the nation's biggest and oldest hire full-time staffs and pay
them straight salaries. Their financial inducements to hold back
treatment are usually relatively slight.
   But many that started during the 1980s have made financial
incentives their centerpiece. These HMOs contract with individual
doctors who see HMO customers along with private-practice patients.
   To keep doctors from spending too lavishly, HMOs typically pay
flat monthly fees for each patient, no matter how often the doctor
sees them. Bonuses and penalties depend on how frugal or free they
have been with tests, referrals to specialists and hospital
admissions.
   HMOs' supporters say the result is cost-conscious medicine that
is better for everyone, since it helps avoid unnecessary and
potentially harmful tests and treatments. Indeed, some believe too
much medical attention is as dangerous as too little.
   However, others worry the financial rewards are so strong that
even ethically minded doctors will be tempted to err in favor of
doing too little in situations where the correct course of
treatment is unclear.
   No one has studied the medical fate of people who join HMOs with
strong financial rewards and penalties. So there is no clear
evidence this potential conflict of interest is harmful.
Nonetheless, troubling anecdotes abound.
   Dr. Denise Hart, a kidney specialist in San Antonio, remembers a
patient with kidney failure who went to a hospital one Sunday night
in urgent need of dialysis treatment.
   The emergency room doctor wanted to call in Hart to see the man.
But when he called the patient's HMO primary-care doctor _ the
``gatekeeper'' in HMO terminology _ for permission, the physician
refused. Instead, Hart said, the patient stayed overnight in the
hospital without dialysis. As a result, he suffered cardiac arrest
and spent a week on a respirator.
   ``I think it was greed,'' Hart said of the HMO doctor. ``He
tried to squeak by without getting stuff done that absolutely
needed to be done. The system is set up so there is a strong
incentive for these things to happen.''
   The patient recovered, and nothing happened to the doctor.
Elsewhere, however, HMOs' financial incentives to limit care have
figured in malpractice suits.
   According to court papers, a Saginaw, Mich., HMO patient with
vaginal bleeding was given antibiotics for five months before her
doctor sent her to a gynecologist. The specialist checked her for
venereal disease, found nothing and told her to return in a month.
However, her primary-care doctor refused to approve a second visit.
Eight months after her initial visit, she went to an emergency room
where doctors performed a biopsy and discovered she had cervical
cancer.
   The HMO had set up financial pools to cover patients' specialist
appointments, tests and hospital care. Money left over at the end
of the year was split between the doctor and the HMO.
   ``The result was that the fewer referrals a doctor made and the
fewer hospitalizations he ordered for his patients, the more money
he made,'' Circuit Judge Robert L. Kaczmarek wrote in a ruling on
preliminary pleadings. The case is scheduled for trial in January.
   When a Greenville, S.C., man with a long history of manic
depression joined an HMO, his new physician halted treatment by a
psychiatrist and took him off medication. Dr. Iverson Brownell, the
psychiatrist, strongly disagreed with the doctor's contention that
a specialist was not needed.
   ``I wrote him that this was completely unsatisfactory,'' said
Brownell, adding that ``financial considerations had to be'' one
factor in the doctor's decision.
   The patient eventually suffered a psychotic episode and could no
longer work, his attorney said. A suit against the HMO physician
was settled out of court.
   When a 22-year-old woman in Wilmington, Del., went to her HMO
physician complaining of a breast lump, she was told not to worry
about it, according to her attorney. Her gynecologist recommended
she go to a surgeon for a biopsy, but the physician rejected the
request. A year later the woman was found to have spreading cancer.
She sued and reached an out-of-court settlement with her physician
and the HMO.
   Her lawyer, Randall Robbins, said the plan's system of bonuses
and penalties deterred visits to specialists. ``Why else would one
doctor question another's request for consultation with a
specialist unless there was some type of incentive involved?''
   HMOs' promotional brochures rarely mention the financial
incentives that may spur doctors to limit their care. Instead, they
dwell on the advantages: HMO clients pay flat monthly charges that
are usually lower than traditional health insurance. In exchange,
the HMO agrees to give womb-to-tomb care for every conceivable
physical ill.
   However, patients usually cannot see specialists unless their
primary-care physician, the ``gatekeeper,'' approves. The same
doctor makes most important decisions about tests and hospital care.
   Nearly half the nation's 607 HMOs use a method called capitation
to pay their doctors. For a flat monthly fee, doctors provide all
their patients' routine office care. One industry survey found that
in 47 percent of capitation arrangements, the fee also covers
tests. In 22 percent, it covers specialty referrals, and in 9
percent it also pays for hospital care.
   Such plans, along with bonuses and penalties, put doctors at
risk of personal loss of income if they are unfortunate enough to
have a few very sick _ and very expensive _ HMO patients.
   Depending on the expense of their patients, doctors in some HMOs
can raise their pay _ or lower it _ by 20 percent.
   ``Incentive plans may offer such strong financial incentives to
physicians to reduce utilization that quality of care could be
adversely affected through the withholding of needed services,''
concluded a report by the U.S. General Accounting Office.

   One of the country's largest HMO organizations to use capitation
is U.S. Healthcare, which operates plans with about 1 million
customers in the Northeast. Their doctors get bonus checks each
month if they send fewer than the expected number of patients to
specialists or to hospitals.
   Dr. Neil Schlackman, U.S. Healthcare's medical director, defends
incentives as long as quality of care is also figured into the
basic payment formulas.
   ``If you are in first grade, a gold star may help,'' said
Schlackman. ``But in a physician's office, the only thing that
really gets the attention of the physician is the incentive of
increasing payment for better quality cost-effective care.''
   Dr. Lorna Stuart of Phoenixville, Pa., gets about half of her
patients from U.S. Healthcare. While she said she is not tempted by
the incentives, she is not so sure about her colleagues. Some
family doctors may be tempted to avoid specialists' fees by trying
their hand at tasks for which they are unqualified, such as taking
on the plastic surgeon's job of repairing facial cuts, she said.
   ``If a doctor's ethics were not golden, they might say, `I can
sew that up myself,' and the patient would be left with a
second-rate repair job,'' she said. ``But the doctor would not have
that consultant's charge taken out of his pool.''
   Many doctors say they give HMO patients just as good care as
they give those with private insurance. However, evidence is
building that the care, while perhaps as good, is different.
   In a recent study, doctors at Virginia Commonwealth University
compared the way 17 doctors performed checkups. Forty percent of
their privately insured patients received four or more tests,
compared with 11 percent of their HMO patients.
   In another study, Dr. Alan L. Hillman of the University of
Pennsylvania found HMO doctors who were at financial risk for their
patients' hospital bills also tended to see patients in their
offices less often. He interpreted this as ``scheduling less visits
in order to use less services.''
   ``We all believe that most doctors will do what's in the
patient's best interest when it's obvious what to do,'' said
Hillman.
   Hillman said crooked doctors may blatantly hold back care just
to make more money. More often, however, doctors honestly disagree
about what's needed. In those situations, some physicians may
consistently decide against tests and procedures because they are
subconsciously swayed by financial reasons.
   ``In my opinion,'' he said, ``there are at least a few HMOs that
are at the extreme end of the incentives, and we need to find out
which those are.''
   However, Dr. Donald Berwick, vice president for quality of care
measurement at the Harvard Community Health Plan in Boston, said
traditional medicine gives doctors financial motives to provide too
much care, rather than too little.
   ``I am worried by systems that really place physicians greatly
at risk for the consequences of their clinical judgments, as I am
worried about systems that place physicians' interest greatly in
accord with doing lots of procedures,'' he said. ``There are
hazards at both ends.''

   When the forerunners of health maintenance
organizations opened for business around the turn of the century,
the idea was simple: Two doctors joined forces to take care of
customers for 50 cents a month.
   The basic notion of all-inclusive coverage for a flat fee
remains. But otherwise, the financial arrangements between HMOs and
their physicians have grown far more complicated.
   Here are the basic kinds of HMOs:
   _Staff model. Care is provided by doctors who are full-time
employees of the HMO.
   _Group model. The HMO contracts with a large, independent group
practice to tend its patients.
   _Network model. Instead of relying on just one group, the HMO
has ties with several group practices.
   _Individual practice association. Eighty percent of HMOs that
are less than 3 years old use this arrangement. Most care is
provided by individual doctors in private practice. They may see
patients from several HMOs as well as those covered by traditional
insurance.
   Here are some of major financial arrangments:
   _Salary. Typically used by staff model HMOs. Doctors also may
share in a year-end bonus if the HMO makes money.
   _Fee for service. Doctors are paid a fee by the HMO each time
they see a patient.
   _Capitation. Doctors receive a flat monthly fee for each
patient, whether they see them several times or not at all.
Depending on the arrangement, the fee may cover only office visits
to the primary-care doctor, or it may include tests, referrals to
specialists or hospitalization.
   _Risk pools. The HMO withholds a percentage of the physician's
pay. The doctor gets all or part of the money back if some
financial goal is met. Some HMOs use money in the pools to cover
the deficit if the doctor overspends the amount allocated for
specialty and hospital care.
   _Deficits. If the physician's spending exceeds the amount set
aside in the risk pool, he may be expected to make up the
difference by direct repayment to the HMO, by reduced capitation
fees or an increase in the amount withheld from future risk pools.
   _Stop-loss. The HMO may put a dollar limit on the physician's
potential losses for expensive patients.
   _Bonuses. If the physician spends less than the amount budgeted
by the HMO for patients' major services, such as referrals and
hospital care, he may split the leftover money with the HMO.

<HEAD>Should Patients Be Told of Doctors' Financial Stake?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Should patients be told their doctor has a
financial stake in keeping them away from specialists and out of
hospitals?
   Many health maintenance organizations pay their doctors more if
they are frugal with tests and other expensive care. Even though
such financial arrangements can influence the kind of treatment
patients get, the incentives are rarely disclosed when people sign
up with the pre-paid plans.
   Some believe that should change.
   ``When we talked to our patients, they didn't have the foggiest
idea how these things really worked,'' said Dr. Joel Rubenstein, a
cardiologist at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in suburban Boston.
   ``I thought that was not correct, because ultimately patients
and physicians should have a straightforward relationship,'' he
said. ``It should be one where the physician is always the
patient's advocate. There should be no competing interest to that
advocacy.''
   Rubenstein is co-author of a bill, now before the Massachusetts
Legislature, that would require HMOs to spell out their physicians'
financial incentives in brochures written in plain English. The
Massachusetts Medical Society supports the proposal.
   However, Dr. Harris Berman, president of the Boston area's Tufts
Associated Health Plan, said people who join HMOs already know that
their doctors are supposed to work ``in a cost-effective fashion.''
   Anyway, he added, ``it doesn't matter how much we put in print.
Most people don't read it.''
   Disclosure has figured into at least one legal case against an
HMO. In a class action suit filed under the federal racketeering
law, U.S. Healthcare has been taken to court in Philadelphia for
not making these incentives clear.
   ``It's a classic case of fraud for the patient not to be
informed,'' said Merrill G. Davidoff, one of the lawyers who
brought the suit.
   At U.S. Healthcare, Dr. Michael A. Stocker, a senior vice
president, said financial incentives are discussed in news articles
and in state rate filings.
   However, ``it is not industry tradition to disclose incentives''
directly to clients, Stocker said. ``Physicians don't disclose how
much money they make if they provide a procedure to a patient. If
it becomes traditional within the industry, we would do it, too.''

<HEAD>Bush Under Pressure to Call Decennial Conference on Aging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates for the elderly are dismayed that
President Bush has not called what would be the fourth decennial
White House Conference on Aging for 1991 to help guide a graying
America into the next century.
   Time is short for planning a productive conference that can
steer clear of intergenerational conflicts and avoid political
pitfalls that plagued the last such gathering in 1981, supporters
say. Opinion is divided, however, on whether the inaction is a
result of normal bureaucratic delay, a reluctance to convene a
populist gathering of the elderly or a desire to limit its scope.
   ``There is a growing sense that the White House really doesn't
want this conference and therefore would like to delay it as long
as possible,'' said Fernando Torrez-Gil, president-elect of the
American Society on Aging.
   The White House conferences, which bring together thousands of
delegates from around the nation to focus on the needs and
contributions of the elderly and their role in society, have been a
decennial tradition since 1961.
   The first two helped launch federal programs ranging from
Medicare to Meals-on-Wheels. The 1981 gathering, though marred by
politics, helped fend off cuts in Social Security.
   Congress in 1987 passed legislation authorizing _ not requiring
_ the president to continue the tradition in 1991, but Bush has yet
to announce his intentions. He is ``interested in having one, but
more work needs to be done before a final decision can be made,''
said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   Twenty-four major groups, the Leadership Council of Aging
Organizations, wrote to Bush in August urging him to call a
conference, and 90 House members sent a similar request in
September, warning that ``time is running out.'' The House letter
was initiated by Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., who said previous
presidents acted earlier to call each of the preceding conferences.
   Expectations that a 1991 conference was a certainty now are
giving way to ``skepticism about whether there will be one,'' said
Dan Quirk, executive director of the National Association of State
Units on Aging.
   Advocates say the 1991 conference is needed to help the nation
prepare for its unprecedented aging. The population 65 and over is
expected to rise from 12 percent in 1987 to nearly 23 percent by
2040. In sheer numbers, that means an increase from 29.8 million in
1987 to 68.1 million in 2040, with the biggest increases occuring
among the oldest of the elderly.
   ``Every institution in society is going to have to respond to
the needs of a much older population,'' Quirk said. ``This
conference could set the stage to prepare for that demographic
revolution.''
   Torrez-Gil predicted Bush eventually would yield to pressure,
but that the conference date would be pushed back from 1991.
   Bush could derive ``real dividends'' from convening a bipartisan
conference that is ``a genuine town meeting on issues in the field
of aging,'' said Arthur Flemming, a former health, education and
welfare secretary who chaired the 1971 conference and was deputy
chairman 10 years later.
   But Daniel Schulder of the National Council on the Aging said
Bush may be dragging his feet to limit a conference's scope and
reduce grass-roots interest generated by the state and local forums
that typically precede it.
   ``If you delay long enough, you only have time for a much
smaller kind of conference, directed toward mavens and experts,
rather than a popular conference,'' he said. ``The signals are
clearly dilatory.''
   The death earlier this year of Rep. Claude Pepper of Florida,
the singular champion of the elderly, has limited Congress' ability
to exert pressure for a 1991 conference, Schulder said.
   In the absence of a decision from Washington, some states are
moving ahead on their own. Illinois, for example, is organizing
local forums and a state conference regardless of what Bush does.
``The challenge to be part of the solution to the ever-increasing
problems of an aging society is an opportunity we do not want to
see forsaken,'' said state Aging Director Janet Otwell.
   While most advocacy groups are pressing for a 1991 conference, a
few voices question its usefulness and warn of a potential backlash
against the elderly.
   Dr. Robert Butler, a former director of the National Institute
on Aging, questions whether spending millions on a ``vapid,
decennial ritual'' that he said could fuel conflicts between the
young and old while accomplishing little.
   ``Let us not provide another opportunity for writers, press, and
the public to image older people as special pleaders or `greedy
geezers,''' Butler wrote recently. He said an annual report on the
status of the aged would be better.
   One advocacy group avoiding the push for the White House
conference is the Gray Panthers, which believes many concerns of
the elderly, such as health care and housing, are better addressed
as issues for society overall. ``We feel that we need to take a
more holistic look at the problems of our society,'' said Executive
Director Frances Humphreys. ``We would love to see an
intergenerational conference.''
   Supporters of a conference on aging believe it must focus not on
what government can do for senior citizens but on how the nation's
aging affects all of society and on concerns that cut across
generations.
   Joyce Berry, acting U.S. commissioner on aging, this summer told
a House panel that Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan was interested in focusing the conference on a ``binding
of generations and capitalizing upon what generations can do for
each other.''
   Issues such as access to health care, nursing home costs,
employment, income security and family caregiving are ``no longer
older persons issues, they are family issues,'' said Illinois'
Otwell.
   The National Council on the Aging suggested a concurrent White
House conference on children so common problems could be evaluated
in a coordinated way without pitting young and old against one
another.
   Dual conferences could help blunt the resentment of ``people who
like to think in terms of generational warfare,'' Schulder said.
   Conference supporters say that besides promoting generational
unity, the meeting must avoid the politicization of 1981, when the
Reagan administration was accused of trying to pack the event with
supporters of proposed budget cuts in Social Security and other
programs. The legislation that authorizes the 1991 conference says
delegates ``shall be selected without regard to political
affiliation or past partisan activity.''
   ``We're hoping for a conference in 1991, but only if it's
constructive and only if it's properly funded and meaningful,''
said John Rother, legislative director of the American Association
of Retired Persons. ``I don't think anybody wants a repeat of
1981.''

<HEAD>Pilot Retirement Rule Irks Some, But FAA Sees No Reason To Change</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   To hear Capt. Jack Young tell it, just when
you've reached the peak of your abilities flying a jetliner, they
kick you out of the cockpit.
   ``When a pilot reaches 60, he has gotten there because he's
healthy and proficient,'' said Young, 69, who was forced by
30-year-old Federal Aviation Administration rules to quit flying
airliners after 35 years in the cockpit.
   Despite mounting pressure and the heroics of veteran pilots, the
FAA sees no reason to change its ruling that commercial pilots and
co-pilots hand over the controls at 60, or at least get in the back
seat as flight engineer.
   ``It should be optional to continue or retire at 60 or any other
age. If a man is physically fit and functionally able and motivated
to continue flying, he should be able to do so,'' said Young, a
former Eastern Airlines pilot and the founder of the ``Gray
Eagles'' _ formally the Pilots Rights Association.
   He hopes to draw on public admiration for veterans like Al
Haynes, 58, the United Airlines captain who landed in Iowa in July
with no hydraulic controls, and David Cronin, 59, the United pilot
who safely landed in February, on his second-to-last commercial
flight, after a section of fuselage blew out.
   The FAA developed the rule because statistics showed ``a
significantly higher incidence of incapacitating events'' after age
60, said John Leyden, a spokesman in Washington. ``That has been
the basis for 30 years.''
   The agency has never satisfied itself of a way to separate
healthy 60-year-olds from those showing their age, Leyden said.
``Making it 60 may not be the best way to go, but we don't know of
any better way.''
   The rule, which took effect March 15, 1960, has been challenged
repeatedly at the FAA and in the courts. Numerous pilots have
sought exemptions but all have lost _ most recently in a May
decision on a request by 24 pilots.
   The FAA noted that while a number of older pilots oppose the
rule, others _ and their union, the Air Line Pilots Association _
support it.
   ``We're opposed to changing the rule,'' said Dick Stone, 57, a
Delta captain and ALPA executive chairman for aeromedical
resources. Health and safety aside, he said, it ``ensures promotion
for younger pilots. If we changed the age to an older age, it would
stall the careers of some pilots.''
   Each side can cite studies supporting its point, but the FAA
said in May that a performance probably starts diminishing past 50,
and ``the experience of pilots age 60 and over does not outweigh
the danger they present from sudden incapacitation or otherwise
diminished mental or physical performance.''
   The FAA said it is willing to look at any scientific evidence
that will help find ``a way to discriminate between those who
contribute to the adverse trend of increasing accidents (involving
older pilots) and those who do not.''
   ``Age, in and of itself, should not be the criterion,'' said Dr.
Herbert Karp, a professor of medicine and neurology at Atlanta's
Emory University and medical director at the Wesley Woods Geriatric
Hospital. ``We know that as we get older, there are certain
physiological changes that do occur.
   ``But there's a great variability in the occurrence of these
changes.''
   Mandatory retirement based on age has ``very little
justification,'' and even if there were such a cutoff, 60 is
probably as much as a decade too soon, he said. ``We can't say, but
it would be likely to be in the seventh decade.''
   ``We really think of problems emerging at 75 and above,'' said
Dr. Robert N. Butler, Brookdale professor of Geriatrics at New
York's Mount Sinai Medical Center. ``There is an increased
incidence of cardiovascular disease in the late 50s and 60s but
there's no sort of arbitrary jump at a magical age called 60.''
   Besides, Butler said, in a jetliner there's at least one other
crew member to fly if the pilot suffers a heart attack. But the Age
60 Rule applies only to airline pilots; nothing says a 100-year-old
can't fly a Cessna anywhere.
   ``There are people over 60 flying airplanes all the time,'' he
said. ``It's only passenger carriers that they haven't been
flying.''
   Butler, a former director of the National Institute on Aging,
once proposed letting some pilots fly past 60 under a test program.
The FAA declined. ``We do need experienced pilots, and it's a shame
they haven't gotten to test it.''
   Meanwhile, a group of about 30 pilots fighting the rule has
filed an appeal in the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago, which is expected to hear the case sometime next year.
   The Gray Eagles are waiting anxiously _ as many as 1,000 veteran
pilots who aren't quite ready for a life of fishing and golf.
   ``It's one of those things,'' said Young. ``Unless you're a
pilot, you can't understand the magic of flying and the hold it has
on you.
   ``These are guys who feel they can continue making a
contribution, and they want to continue doing so.''

   Gladys Burkhead and her sister, Viola
Spratlen, got into a cab the other day and the cabbie lit up. Poor
cabbie.
   ``The guy was smoking and I just had a fit,'' said Gladys. She
and Viola are annoyed by second-hand smoke, and they aren't shy
about saying so.
   ``He said it was his cab and I said we were paying the bill. I
said if that's the way you feel about it we'll just get out right
here. And we did. I said, `Don't pay him, Viola,' but she did,''
said Gladys, 83.
   ``When you're old, you can bawl people out,'' said Viola, 78,
with a laugh. ``When we order a cab we ask 'em not to smoke. I
wouldn't have done that 20 years ago.''
   Why not? ``You just don't. You wouldn't have the nerve to do
it.''
   ``I think the difference is, I've survived all these years, and
since I did survive, I can say more what I want to,'' said Gladys.
``I've just got a few more years left, why not do some of the
things the way I want them done?''
   Gladys and Viola surely do things their own way. They own their
own home, live frugally on savings and Social Security, collect and
mend clothing for the poor and nurture a neighborhood association
Gladys founded 10 years ago.
   Gladys, the spryer of the two, keeps a tidy yard and garden,
coordinates volunteers who plant flowers in the median of a
23-block-long boulevard, and can't imagine being bored.
   ``Well, I know what I would have done if you weren't here,'' she
said. ``I was going to start on the north side and trim down all
the vines that have grown up in the lilacs and then go around and
finish the other sides.''
   ``I would have thought of something to do, too,'' said Viola.
``She does the outside work and I do the inside work. You can't
have two people in the same house work on a garden. We've got more
friends who complain that so and so went right out and mowed over
the petunias.''
   The sisters agree that good health is critical for older people,
but being happy has more to do with a cheery outlook than a perfect
checkup.
   ``When you give up, it takes a long time to die,'' said Gladys.
``Grandma Perkins inspired me. The last day she lived she mowed her
yard, picked it all up, pulled weeds and went to bed and died. She
was 89.''
   Viola has trouble walking so it's a struggle reaching their
second-floor living quarters. ``The only time my knees don't hurt
is when I'm sitting still. But I've always said that if I can't
walk I'm going to crawl.''
   Thirty years ago they bought their 2{-story home near Drake
University and until three years ago they ran a small day care on
the first floor. Their major expenses are health insurance, food
and taxes. They don't have a car and are happy to depend on buses
and cabs. Viola takes a few day trips with a seniors group and both
visit Viola's daughter, Lucille, in Arizona once a year.
   Getting old, they say, has been a lark.
   ``Land, yes, it's easier when you're older,'' they said, almost
in unison.
   ``When you're young,'' said Gladys, ``you're not very smart.
You've got to make decisions that last the rest of your life.
   ``When you're older, that's all over with.''
   ``Now I don't have a worry in the world,'' said Viola. ``I used
to worry about Lucille. Now I let her do the worrying.''
   The sisters, born to a farm family in the central Iowa town of
Prole, also say there are improvements that have made life easier
for older people, such as good cars, indoor plumbing, central
heating and the like. But those are just the trimmings. They'd be
happy being old no matter what the year.
   ``You have a lot more fun when you're older,'' said Gladys.
   ``Because you don't have all those worries,'' finished Viola.
   Worries?
   ``Oh, the clothes...'' began Gladys.
   ``Oh, yes,'' said Viola, again with a laugh. ``We used to have
to wear a hat and gloves and everything to match. Now you can go
out and it doesn't matter if it matches or not.''

   Being a grandparent does mean holidays,
birthdays, going fishing and baking cookies. It also means helping
grandchildren deal with the pressures of growing up by sharing the
benefit of a longer life's experience.
   But meaningful communication is more than ``How did you do at
school today?'' said Robert Strom, an Arizona State University
psychologist who taught a 12-week class, ``Becoming a Better
Grandparent.'' ``Grandparents used to have a role that was well
defined. They understood what they were supposed to do and most of
the family counted on the grandparents.''
   The course offered by Strom and his wife, Shirley, an Arizona
State research associate, attracted more than 200 grandparents from
the Phoenix area for weekly 90-minute discussion sessions.
Participants each interviewed one of their grandchildren once a
week and listened to tape-recorded discussions of young people
talking about issues that were important to them.
   ``Almost all of the literature on grandparents is entirely
patronizing,'' Strom said. ``It suggests that grandparernts don't
need any education because they're all so old and wise.''
   But participants found many subjects about which they weren't so
wise, topics like drugs, AIDS, gender roles and self esteem. They
watched videotapes of children and their parents giving their views
on the same subjects. They found that their views on many subjects
changed as the classes progressed.
   ``We had a tendency to compare our grandchildren with how we
raised our children,'' said Rodie Wright of Sun City. ``We found
out that was all wrong. We also found out we had to be more
open-minded.''
   And they learned it's OK to take a more active role.
   ``We must give advice openly and freely, knowing the choice is
theirs whether it is accepted,'' said Phyllis Wells of Casa Grande.
   The grandparents were provided with questions to ask
grandchildren to get to know them better, Strom said. ``The
affection was there, but they were not talking, not communicating''
about important issues.
   Participants came away with a better understanding of their
grandchildren as well as their own roles as grandparents.
   ``We came away from the class feeling really good about our
chances of staying close to our granddaughters,'' said Barbara
Yarger of Phoenix, who attended with her husband, Bill. ``We
learned how to break the barriers.''

   Ann Valletta was devastated when her husband
died 15 years ago, but she began a new life as a ``grandmother'' to
handicapped kids. ``I came here and I found myself,'' she said
during a break at the Rehabilitation Institute of Pittsburgh, where
she works with children five days a week. ``If I hadn't come to
this place, I think I would have been in a sanitarium. I find peace
here.''
   Mrs. Valletta, 77, is one of 20,000 foster grandparents across
the nation and in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands helping kids
with special needs in homes, schools, hospitals, day-care and
detention centers and halfway houses.
   The Foster Grandparents program was established by the
government in 1965 to help low-income people over 60 remain active
in community service by helping youngsters who are disabled,
troubled, abused or neglected. It is successful because it
``combines two groups of people who need each other, and it
clicks,'' said Ray Tejada, national director.
   ``We tend to forget the contributions that elderly people can
make,'' said former First Lady Nancy Reagan, who has supported
Foster Grandparents since the late 1960s. ``There are all kinds of
things that come with age, such as more patience and more
understanding, and this is the one program that helps both ends of
the age spectrum: The young and the elderly.
   ``They have a special bond between each other.''
   Volunteers get a stipend of $44 a week for 20 hours of work. The
federal government pays 90 percent of the program's costs and local
agencies pay the rest. The program cost the federal government
$57.4 million last year, a small amount compared to other federal
programs, Tejada said.
   The money is nothing compared to the joy Mrs. Valletta finds in
being needed. ``Sometimes I'm tired and I don't want to get up but
they're waiting for me.''
   Lou, a 6-year-old boy with curvature of the spine and a learning
disability that makes speaking and conentrating difficult, was
waiting one recent morning.
   ``What is this letter?'' Mrs. Valletta asked, holding up a large
card.
   Lou paused and slowly said, ``Q.''
   ``Good work,'' she said, patting his head and smiling at the
pleased boy. At hospitals in New York City and Atlanta, foster
grandparents care for infants who were abused, abandoned, born
drug-addicted or infected with AIDS.
   ``They just rock and cuddle that child and feed him,'' said
Marshall Neil, director of the program in Atlanta. ``It's amazing
what the grandparent can do to that little life.''
   In San Jose, Calif., foster grandparents at the Santa Clara
County juvenile center teach crocheting and other crafts and advise
youths.
   ``The kids really relate to these grandparents,'' said director
Betty Manley. ``Counselors often tell us that the grandparent was
able to get through to the child when a counselor couldn't.''
   In Pittsburgh, foster grandparents help children ``who fall
through the cracks of social service agencies,'' said program
director Jim Farwell. ``Our grandparents are the least threatening
of caseworkers. We go in there and try and help build, solidify
that family.
   ``The kids get a lot of hope, a lot of love. And the
grandparents get a lot of love back. They get the hugs, the kisses
and the looks.''
   Many foster grandparents find a new sense of purpose through the
children they ``adopt'' after their own have grown and their spouse
has died.
   For the past 11 years, widow Mary Bradley, 85, has left her home
each morning for a bus ride across town to the Rehabilitation
Institute.
   ``Those that can't help themselves, I help,'' she said. ``I love
the girls. I love them all. I learn something every day from the
children.''
   Like any proud grandmother, 76-year-old Jean Carlino shows
friends snapshots of her young companions at the institute and
keeps an album of their photos in her dresserr. ``The kids always
say, `I love you' and we love them.''
   When 4-year-old Lance Long, who has cerebral palsy, moved into
the center, he said, Mrs. Carlino and other foster grandparents
helped him overcome his homesickness by showing him photos of his
mother when he cried for her.
   ``Sometimes they take me for walks and take me to school.
Sometimes they help me brush my teeth and comb my hair.''

   Who's doing Thanksgiving this year?
   Is it at your children's, and are they cooking up the big bird
with all the trimmings, celebrating with their favorite foods and
introducing them to their children? Or is it just the two of you,
where a capon, duck or Cornish hen with a tasty stuffing,
vegetables, salad and a light dessert fit the bill?
   Whatever the setting or number of people, all the holiday
favorites bring back memories of this wonderful day from our own
childhoods.
   At our house, it was old-fashioned stuffing: white bread,
celery, onions and a hefty sprinkling from a yellow poultry
seasoning box with an illustrated turkey on it. A lot of stuffing
went inside me and come dinnertime, my appetite was diminished. My
grandmother always made salted cashews for holiday dinners, baked
until a burnished bronze, rubbed with brown paper to remove excess
fat, then placed in tiny silver nut dishes that I had polished. My
sister, Gerry, and I would tiptoe around the table taking a nut or
two from each dish; my hunch is the grownups were aware of the
game, but winked it away.
   It's very likely that we'll enjoy many of our favorites:
cranberry sauce, sweet potato pudding, mashed potatoes with gravy,
creamed onions, tunips, green beans, pumpkin or mincemeat pie. To
really enjoy the day, we should eat smaller portions, but not enjoy
it less.
   If you are having Thanksgiving with your family, you may want to
pitch in the next day and do something with the leftovers. Turkey
salad with fall fruits would be a delightful entree that puts the
bird in a different setting.
   If it's dinner a deux, a light, refreshing all-natural fruit ice
cream dessert leaves out the cream and eggs but doesn't change the
flavor or texture.
   And if you're taking a covered dish, turnip souffle is a part of
the traditional vegetable scene that even non-turnip fans will like.

<HEAD>Key to Difficult Vegetables May Be An Off-Beat Approach</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   George Bria retired from the AP in 1981 after 40
years that included coverage of World War II from Italy.

<TEXT>
   Some vegetables give us a hard time in
the garden before, if ever, we win them over. The key may lie in an
off-beat approach.
   Directions on seed packets don't help much. They're generalized,
whereas a garden is a highly individual, quirky place.
   For a long time, parsnips stumped me. Parsnips are a
long-maturing crop, going from spring into fall frosts before you
harvest the delicious taproots, but I couldn't even get the seeds
to sprout. Homespun solutions, like covering the row with damp
newspapers, or wetting it down and putting a board on top to
prolong the moisture, did nothing for me.
   Finally, I moved the process indoors and started the seeds like
tomatoes, peppers and eggplants, with carefully controlled soil,
light, temperature and moisture. In six-pack cells, I planted seeds
in good potting soil and put them under my fluorescent stand. In
two weeks, all six seeds had sprouted.
   After the seedlings formed true leaves, I moved them out to the
cold frame for a week of hardening. On planting day, I punched deep
holes in the ground with an iron bar, filled the holes with compost
mixed with fertilizer and put in the seedlings. In a few weeks I
had strong, healthy plants.
   It's unorthodox with a root crop, but it worked for me. Carrots,
also poor sprouters, responded to the same treatment.
   Beets germinated in my garden all right, but I got dwarfish,
stunted crops until I read in a manual, ``Use wood ashes where you
grow beets.'' With ashes plentiful from fireplace and woodstove,
the situation improved dramatically; I moved up to plump, tender
beets in a single season. Wood ashes, rich in potash and the
alkalinity needed to sweeten the soil, also help many other
vegetables, flowers and shrubs. (Spread store-bought lime if you
don't have ashes but don't use either on plants that like acid.)
With beets, you mix the ashes into the soil before planting and
then make side dressings as the season moves on.
   Frustration comes from planting too early or in an unsuitable
spot.
   My garden, in hilly, wooded country 50 miles north of Manhattan,
tends to be cool. By trial and error, I learned that it was
unrealistic to plant warmth-loving things like beans before the
middle of May. An early day may be balmy, but the ground is still
cold and seeds just rot. My best bean harvests come from seeds
planted in June, July and August.
   And part of my garden gets some shade, fine for greens like
lettuce but not for sun-lovers like beans and tomatoes that need at
least six hours of direct sunlight.
   Homesick for the tropics, eggplants act moody in northern
climes. They like heat so much that some people put seed flats near
the furnace or on radiators to get them to germinate. In my
climate, we don't set the plants in the ground until well into
June. You've got to watch your harvest closely, too, picking the
fruit when it's young, firm and lustrous. When eggplants soften and
lose their shine, the taste goes ``off.''
   A retired person with time to experiment can challenge the
improbable, like raising artichokes in the Northeast, where winter
likely kills even the best-mulched plants. Horticulturists with
professional savvy and equipment have found a way. The secret is to
start the seed early in February in wet sphagnum moss in the
refrigerator. In this cold, but not freezing, temperature, you
``vernalize'' the emerging radicle (the first part of the root) for
at least two weeks before taking it out of the refrigerator and
planting it in a pot.
   Come spring, you transplant it outdoors. The process shortens
the artichoke's normal two-year life cycle; the luscious globes are
then obtainable in six months. A scientist friend gave me such a
plant and produced a globe in my garden. But I haven't had any luck
doing it on my own in the refrigerator.
   The seeds of some plants may defy all attempts to get them to
germinate.
   New Zealand spinach, a popular summer vegetable which flourishes
when other greens wilt in the sun, often maddeningly refuses to
sprout. You may soak the large seed before planting it, you may
baby it indoors _ nothing helps. But _ a lesson i irony _ New
Zealand spinach loves to seed itself and you'll find plants
springing up at unexpected places in your garden, the offspring of
summers past.
   Nature likes to keep you guessing.

   Elmo Meiners makes a living off
something that he really enjoys _ though he has to get up a little
early to do it.
   ``My biggest satisfaction is going out every morning at 5:30 and
talking to farmers _ playing a little gin rummy and finding out
what they think.''
   For 40 years, Meiners has been asking farmers what equipment
would make things easier, then manufacturing it. And that didn't
stop even during his 75th birthday party in August. As the cake was
cut, he was sketching.
   Farmers' needs inspired Meiners and Art Warsaw to develop a
transmission to double the speed of the Farmall tractor in 1949.
That was the birth of M&amp;W Gear Co. Assembled in an old one-room
schoolhouse, the M&amp;W nine-speed transmission caught on; the company
sold 1,400 the first year, grossing $160,000.
   Success with the transmission led to development of parts like
aluminum pistons that raised the Farmall's power from 39 to 51
horsepower. Watching the farmers haul grain in 100-bushel wagons
with small tires gave him the idea for the Little Red Wagon. It
held 300 bushels and large ``floater'' tires enabled it to glide
over the field with less effort.
   ``We just grew, grew, grew,'' said Meiners, whose company is
expected to sell nearly $30 million in farm implements this year.
Warsaw sold his interest in M&amp;W to William and J.C. Ertel of
Indianapolis in 1954. M&amp;W's small size _ about 175 plant workers _
lets it get a product to farmers within a year or two of design,
faster than the major implement makers, he said.
   M&amp;W builds a few prototypes for local farmers to use and
evaluate, and Meiners often tests the equipment on his own
1,500-acre family farm in McLean County. ``Agriculture is changing
so rapidly that it's not difficult to improve equipment for
farmers,'' he said.
   M&amp;W innovations include the first engine turbo-chargers for
tractors and a hay baler that wraps the huge roll in plastic to
protect it from weather while it is stored in the field, said John
E. Smith, vice president of marketing. It now concentrates on
tillage equipment, hay machinery and mowing devices.

<HEAD>83-Year-Old Artist Paints Her Childhood Memories</HEAD>

   Kitty Good doesn't believe in letting her
paintings speak for themselves.
   Each of the nearly 100 scenes she has done since she was 62
comes with a story, usually about her childhood on an isolated
700-acre farm outside Roanoke Rapids, N.C. ``I hated it when I
lived there and I was lonely.''
   Mrs. Good, 83, recalls her early life in colorful, detailed
paintings in the primitive style made famous by Grandma Moses.
   In one, a black woman stands outside a church, holding a white
baby _ the story of a childless black couple who raised a
6-week-old boy abandoned by an unmarried white woman. The black
woman prayed all her life that the mother and son would be
reunited. Two years before the black woman died, they were.
   In another, Mrs. Good's parents sit on the porch of their
farmhouse while their six children play croquet on the lawn. Two
paintings show here June 1930 wedding. One shows Glenn and Kitty
Good surrounded by wedding guests outside the church and another is
of the wedding reception at the farmhouse.
   That wedding took Kitty Good from the remote countryside to
Richmond, where she raised four children. Her husband died in 1979.
   ``I never had a brush in my hand until I was 62 years old and
then I had it in there because of a dare. It was such a joke to
me.''
   Hope Davis taught the art class Mrs. Good entered. ``I took one
look and tried to isolate her from all of the people around her who
might corrupt her. It was just so obvious that she was a natural
primitive.''
   Primitivists have a talent for color and composition and often
draw from their memories, she said. ``They paint everything
individually. It's absolutely amazing. People laugh at them a lot
of times because they're so childlike.''
   Mrs. Good heard plenty of ridicule; Family and friends asked why
her fences and some of her figures looked like they were lying down.
   ``She would be on the verge of tears,'' Ms. Davis said. ``She
would call me and say, `My family is laughing at me.' I said,
`Before you're through they're going to be laughing on the other
side of their face.'''
   Mrs. Good's paintings are in the Asheville Museum of Art, the
Virginia Beach Center for the Arts and the collections of CSX
Corp., the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and U.S. Sens. John W.
Warner and Charles S. Robb.

<HEAD>Exercise Plan Aims to Improve Driving Skills of Elderly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An exercise program designed to help older
Americans become better drivers by improving their flexibility is
described in a pamphlet available from the American Automobile
Association.
   The program, which includes exercises like chin tucks, neck
rotations and side bends, is meant to help avoid fatigue and
improve neck, waist and shoulder flexibility in such situations as
braking, backing and adjusting mirrors.
   It was developed by West Virginia University, where researchers
financed by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, found that
exercise can improve older drivers' range of motion.
   ``There is mounting evidence that much of the decline in
physical fitness that people experience as they grow older stems
from `rusting out' rather than wearing out, because living in a
technologically advanced society has led people to pursue more
sedentary lifestyles,'' the pamphlet says.
   Copies of ``A Flexibility Fitness Training Package for Improving
Older Driver Performance,'' are available for 15 cents each from
local AAA clubs or the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, 1730 M
St. NW, Suite 401, Washington D.C., 20036. Orders of 50 copies or
more cost 10 cents per copy.

   The American Association of Retired Persons
has become a partner in the government-sponsored Take Pride in
America campaign.
   The 4-year-old campaign is meant to educate people on their
responsiblities to help care for parks, forests, archaeological and
historical sites.
   Older people ``want to stay actively involved in making America
a better place to live and in preserving our country's treasures
for generations to come,'' said AARP Vice President Lovola Burgess.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said older Americans ``can make
a real difference in the problems faced by Americans in the decades
to come.''
   The campaign encourages people to help educate one another about
their role in protecting public resources and to get involved in
volunteer activities like caring for parks or highway medians,
volunteering as park rangers or campgound hosts and visiting
classrooms to teach children about public lands.

in the Teamsters will help rank-and-file members combat the union's
reputation as a corrupt organization. Ron Carey, president of the

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen today,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose to a new high
in moderate trading.
   The dollar closed at 143.55 yen, up 0.80 yen from Friday's close
of 142.75 yen. It opened at 143.30 yen and ranged between 143.15
and 143.55 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 5.78-point
winner on Friday, added another 86.92 points, or 0.243 percent, to
rise to a record high of 35,750.12.
   Traders said the dollar rose against the yen on rumors Japan's
trade figures announced later in the afternoon would show a
reduction in the surplus. The figures showed Japan's trade surplus
in October shrank by $3 billion on a year-to-year basis to $4.658
billion.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's strength also followed its
rally in New York Friday, which was triggered by reforms in East
Germany and their uncertain impact on the economy of West Germany.
   ``Trading was centered around the West German mark,'' with
dollar-yen trading relatively light, said a dealer at a major
commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In the Sydney market, which opens before Tokyo, the dollar
dropped back against the mark, influencing the start of Tokyo
trading, but recovered later in the day, said Minori Takeuchi, a
trader at Chemical Bank.
   East Germany's move to open its borders Thursday prompted some
European and North American participants Friday to switch their
holdings from marks to dollars. Others were seen taking profits on
long positions in the mark.
   On the stock exchange, Eastern Europe and Soviet Union-related
stocks did well, traders said.
   Alexander Yakovlev, a top aide to Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, arrived in Tokyo on Sunday for a week of talks with
government and business leaders.
   Trading companies and heavy equipment companies seen as
potentially benefiting from warmer Japan-Soviet and Japan-East
Europe ties rose over attention to Yakovlev's visit, seen as
preparatory to a recently-announced visit by Gorbachev to Japan
expected to take place in 1991.
   ``Fishing companies could be big beneficiaries'' of warmer
Japan-Soviet ties, said a trader at brokerage Kleinwort Benson who
requested anonymity.
   Construction and steel stocks rose as the market believed giant
brokerage Nomura was pushing these sectors prior to a personnel
reshuffle at the firm, the trader said.
   Securities dealers said last week's bullishness on the Tokyo
market carried over to today's trading, but the volume of trade did
not rise proportionally with the Nikkei index.
   ``Most stocks are rising, but the (amount) each share gained is
not necessarily substantial,'' said a dealer at Sanyo Securites Co.
He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The previous high of the Tokyo's exchange's most widely-followed
index was 35,689.98, posted on Sept. 29.

The exchange will continue to be closed from 2:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.

<HEAD>Money Manager Aquires Quaker State Shares, Says He's Optimistic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OIL CITY, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York money manager Mario J. Gabelli,
who has acquired a 5.1 percent stake in Quaker State Corp.,
believes the company's stock is undervalued and says he's
optimistic the motor oil refiner will return to solid profitability.
   Gabelli said Friday he acquired the Quaker State shares as an
investment for his stable of mutual funds.
   Gabelli said his analysis of Quaker State's operations runs
counter to that of other Wall Street analysts who have issued
negative reports both on Quaker State _ because of disappointing
profits _ and on the entire motor oil market.
   Gabelli, whose stake makes his company Quaker State's largest
shareholder, expressed confidence in Jack W. Corn, the company's
president and chief executive officer.
   ``We think Corn has positioned the company in a more sensible
way,'' Gabelli said. ``Previous management took some wrong turns.''
   Corn succeeded Chairman Quentin E. Wood as chief executive in
July 1988.
   Gabelli and other analysts credit Corn with shifting Quaker
State's marketing strategy away from heavy discounting, which was
aimed at retaining market share.
   Other analysts have said that by adopting higher prices, Quaker
State is losing market share and not gaining profits.
   During the first nine months of 1989, Quaker State reported a
profit of $9.45 million, or 35 cents a share, on sales of $613.98
million. That compares with a profit of $9.59 million, or 35 cents
a share, on sales of $673.4 million during the 1988 period.
   But Gabelli said Corn is building a solid foundation for future
profits and in time, Quaker State's performance will rebound.
   ``He has repositioned the product, telling retailers that
(Quaker State) will not be a loss leader,'' he said.
   Gabelli praised Quaker State's chain of 444 quick lube shops as
``extremely well run,'' and said the company benefits from the high
recognition of the Quaker State brand name.
   He said Quaker State's stock is undervalued at $14 or $15 a
share.
   The company's stock closed Friday at $14.87{ in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading, down 12{ cents. On Thursday it jumped
$1.12{ after Gabelli Group Inc. disclosed in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing that it acquired the Quaker State stake.

<HEAD>Dissident Teamsters Hear Call for Further Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Teamsters local president who has been
endorsed for the national union's presidency said further reforms
in the Teamsters will help rank-and-file members combat the union's
reputation as a corrupt organization. Ron Carey, president of the
7,000-member Teamsters Local 804 in New York City, is the first
member to say he will take advantage of new election procedures and
challenge the union's leadership.
   He was endorsed Sunday by the Teamsters for a Democratic Union,
a dissident group within the 1.6 million-member International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, the nation's largest trade union.
   ``We have an opportunity to move this union in new directions,
and we can't miss our chance to regain control of the leadership
that has ignored the needs of members for too long,'' Carey told
the Teamsters for a Democratic Union on Saturday.
   ``Our union's negative image has been formed because of 5
percent of union officials who are corrupt,'' he said.
   About 500 members from across the United States and Canada
gathered over the weekend at a Pittsburgh hotel for the 14th annual
convention of Teamsters for a Democratic Union.
   In addition to endorsing Carey's nomination, delegates passed a
resolution prohibiting negotiation of two-tier contracts, which
provide lower wage scales for some workers doing the same job.
   The TDU was formed in 1976 in Detroit to oppose union election
policies. Now claiming 10,000 members, the group has been
instrumental in winning sweeping reforms in the union, notably the
right to majority rule in elections and contract votes.
   Also invited to address the convention were Teamsters President
William J. McCarthy and Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis, who were
expected to run for the union's top office. Neither accepted the
invitation or was available to comment on Carey's remarks.
   Carey, 53, has been a Teamsters member for 34 years as a United
Parcel Service delivery driver. He doesn't belong to the TDU, but
said he supports its goal of giving members more of a voice.
   ``I would hope that with what we could achieve in 1991, that TDU
won't have to be TDU,'' he told the crowd, which interrupted his
speech several times with standing applause. ``I've been TDU all
along in terms of my beliefs.''
   Last year, under pressure from the Justice Department, which is
fighting alleged corruption in the Teamsters, the union agreed to
allow all union contracts to be decided by majority vote.
   Previously, union policy required a two-thirds vote to reject
pacts approved by Teamsters leaders. The TDU and other asserted
that such elections led to sweetheart deals between union
leadership and employers at the expense of the members.
   In March, union leaders agreed to allow the rank-and-file to
vote directly for the union's president, secretary-treasurer and
the 16 vice presidents who make up the Teamsters' general executive
board.
   Until now, Teamsters leaders were appointed by the board, which
in turn was selected by the general president and confirmed by
fellow board members.
   In a six-month selection process that will begin in October,
members will vote for delegates to a June 1991 convention, where
candidates who receive 5 percent of the delegates' vote will be up
for a ballot in an election in the fall of 1991. All union members
will be eligible to vote in that election.
   Carey hopes to appear on the ballot and says he is trying to
assemble a coalition of reform-minded candidates.

   The annual showcase for the computer industry,
Comdex Fall, kicks off its second decade today with stronger
foreign participation than ever.
   Organizers say interest from abroad is a major factor in the
expansion of the show, which this year will attract a record 1,740
companies showcasing their wares to an expected audience of 120,000.
   The latest in computer technology will be spread over exhibit
space covering an area the size of 21 football fields.
   If attendance is as expected it will set a record for any trade
show in the United States, said Sheldon Adelson, the show's
originator.
   ``I'd never have dreamed it would grow to something like this,''
he said last week in a telephone interview while wrapping up final
details for the annual computer extravaganza. ``But, then, no one
expected to see the computer market grow the way it's growing.''
   A total of 365 foreign companies will be exhibiting this year,
up from 301 a year ago. They will represent 22 foreign countries.
About 15 percent of the attendees will come from abroad.
   Foreign participation is so strong that the organizers have
staff interpreters standing by.
   ``When an exhibitor comes to the show, he can put his product
into the worldwide distribution mainstream,'' Adelson said.
   Comdex officials say the relaxation of trade barriers around the
world is making a significant impact on the computer industry.
   ``Americans are finding they must compete with a rising number
of hardware and software suppliers from Europe, Canada, the Pacific
Rim and Latin America _ not only in these foreign markets, but
right here in the U.S.,'' says Ellen Glew. She is president and
founder of EGI, an international marketing consulting firm
specializing in the computer and communications industries.
   Laptop computers are expected to be a hot item again at the 1989
show. And some exhibitors are even moving down a notch _ showcasing
computers small enough to fit in the breast pocket of a sports
jacket.
   James Fisher, vice president of marketing for Atari Inc., says
business people are constantly faced with the decision of whether
to carry a laptop on trips.
   ``They don't want to lug it around for a two-hour flight,'' he
said.
   Atari's Portfolio is a one-pound computer that operates on two
AA batteries for 48 hours, fits in a jacket pocket and sells for
$400.
   Fisher says Atari's goal at Comdex will be to ``literally have a
computer for everyone.''
   Poqet Computer Corp. will be showcasing a similar product, an
IBM-compatible pocket-sized computer.
   ``Coat-pocket computers will be the Dick Tracy watch of the
1990s, the ultimate office extension,'' predicts Mark Eppley,
chairman of Traveling Software.
   George H. Conrades, a senior vice president at International
Business Machines Corp., will give the keynote address at the
opening session Monday morning. The show runs through Friday.
   Conrades' address, ``A Vision of the '90s: Creating Value in a
Global Marketplace,'' will discuss the challenges of competing on a
global scale.
   Adelson, chairman of Interface Group of Needham, Mass., the
convention's producer, hit upon the idea of Comdex while returning
from another trade show a decade ago.
   The first show in 1979 drew fewer than 4,000 people. Today it is
spread over 10 locations, including the sprawling Las Vegas
Convention Center, six major hotels and other convention facilities
in the city.

<TEXT>
   Chicago's second-largest bank has come a long way
since its near collapse in 1984, but the highlight will be when it
is entirely back in public hands, the chairman of Continental Bank
said.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which holds 26 percent of
Continental stock as a result of bailing out the bank in 1984, is
preparing to sell the final chunk to the public, the Chicago
Sun-Times reported in Sunday's editions.
   The sale could be conducted as early as this month, the
Sun-Times said, citing unidentified sources.
   Thomas Theobald, Continental Bank chairman, has been saying
since early this year that he wanted a return to full public
ownership by the end of 1989. He said he is confident the bank will
reach that watershed in its evolution.
   ``I expect completion of the sale, absent extreme volatility in
the stock market,'' by the end of the year, Theobald said. ``It's
been pretty wild, with 100-point swings every day, to know how to
price an offering, but if it isn't done by Dec. 31, then it will be
Jan. 5.''
   The executive said the public offering should not affect the
bank to a significant degree.
   Theobald now is turning his attention to the 1990s, when
national interstate banking promises to shift restrictions and
gobble up smaller banks.
   ``All we can do is try to be better focused and more
efficient,'' Theobald said. ``That makes it more difficult for some
other ownership group to claim they can do the job better and get
financing to do the takeover.''
   Regulators and bank analysts said that Theobald, who came to
Continental in 1987, is the bank's best defense against unwanted
suitors.
   ``Continental is a Tom Theobald story right now,'' said
Prudential Bache bank analyst Lloyd Widom. ``And he is not going to
manage the bank for someone else.''
   FDIC Chairman William Seidman said Continental's fate is as hard
to predict as anyone's, but ``much depends on whether management
wants it to be acquired.''
   Much has changed since 1984, when federal regulators
restructured the bank and owned almost 100 percent of its stock
after the bank nearly collapsed because of $1 billion in bad energy
loans.
   Today, Continental is a sharply focused business bank,
specializing in controlling interest rate risk for its Fortune 1000
and middle-market customers.
   Under Theobald, the bank left retail banking, sold its suburban
banks and reduced its international operations. The bank, with the
exception of an 11 percent drop last quarter, has shown
quarter-by-quarter improvement.
   The bailout, originally predicted to cost $4.5 billion, is
expected to be as much as $3 billion less, thanks to good
collection efforts on the bad loans by bank employees, said FDIC
spokesman Alan Whitney.
   Still, not everyone thinks highly of Theobald.
   According to a recent ranking by U.S. Banker magazine, Theobald
ranked 38th out of 40 bank chief executive officers in terms of
total return to shareholders in capital appreciation and dividends.
   Theobald has returned 6.7 percent to shareholders annually, the
magazine reported.

   Industrialist Armand Hammer was back home two
days after a heart pacemaker was implanted in his chest and was
expected to return to work on Tuesday, Occidental Petroleum Corp.
officials said.
   The 91-year-old chairman of Occidental was released Sunday from
UCLA Medical Center and his condition was described as good.
   ``He is at home now and he feels great,'' said Occidental
spokesman Frank Ashley. ``He expects to be back in the office on
Tuesday,'' said
   Hammer, who has had heart trouble for more than 20 years,
received the pacemaker Friday. The device regulates electrical
activity in the heart so that it beats normally in a person who
suffers abnormal heart rhythms.
   Doctors told Hammer the pacemaker should protect him ``for at
least eight years,'' Ashley said after talking with the
industrialist.
   Hours after the surgery by pacemaker specialist Dr. Peter Guzy,
Hammer was alert and talking on the telephone.
   ``Recently I had fallen and had some rib trouble,'' Hammer said.
``The doctor recommended I have a pacemaker put in. He said I would
function better and that the pacemaker would protect me from future
problems.''
   Hammer also said he hadn't suffered a heart attack.
   Nearly as well-known for his art collecting and philanthropy as
for his business acumen, Hammer considers himself a private
ambassador for world peace and has met every Soviet leader since
Vladimir Lenin.
   Trading in Occidental stock was suspended Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange because of word Hammer had fallen ill. The price of
Occidental shares has surged in the past when Hammer has been
reported to be in ill health.

<HEAD>Boeing Strike in Key Phase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strike by Boeing Co. production workers enters
a critical phase this week, appearing likely to become the longest
work stoppage at the aerospace giant in more than 40 years.
   With no negotiations scheduled since the Nov. 4 collapse of a
six-day effort, Saturday will be the 45th day of the walkout by the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   The last Boeing strike, in 1977, lasted 45 days and was the
longest since a 4{-month donnybrook in 1948.
   The only other post-World War II Boeing strike was a 19-day
walkout in 1965.
   Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751, said
Sunday night that talks ``could happen'' this week, but he said he
has not heard from federal mediator Doug Hammond, who would
schedule any talks.
   There have been no indications that Boeing might want to resume
talks.
   Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment Sunday night.
   If the strike lasts much longer, Boeing could lose the faith of
its workers, Baker said.
   ``If they don't get this thing settled before too long, they're
going to have a very angry work force. ... The workers will feel
they're being cheated,'' he said, adding his words were not meant
as a threat.
   ``It's a concern. Really, over the years I've been with Boeing,
it's been a company that has enjoyed having a loyal work force. ...
It's just a concern that that might not be that way after this if
they're not careful. It's not a threat at all.''
   Baker said the union was willing to return immediately to the
bargaining table ``as long as it's not another charade,'' referring

<HEAD>EC Unemployment Dips To 9.1 Percent in September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment in the 12 European
Community countries dipped to 9.1 percent in September from 9.2
percent in August and from 9.8 percent a year-earlier, the EC said
Monday.
   According to Eurostat, the EC's statistics' agency, 14.2 million
people were out of jobs in August. A figure for September was
unavailable because of a new method of counting unemployment levels
in the Netherlands.
   Eurostat said the jobless rate showed the biggest declines in
Spain, Ireland, and Britain over the last year.
   Rates in France, Italy, and Luxembourg were little changed,
while the number of jobless in Denmark and Portugal rose slightly.
Unemployment in the Netherlands, Belgium, West Germany, and Greece
fell, in line with the EC average, Eurostat said.
   With some 17 percent of its potential labor force out of a job,
Ireland heads the EC's unemployment list. It is closely followed by
Spain with 16.4 percent unemployed.
   In contrast, Luxembourg has only 2 percent of its citizens out
of work, West Germany has 5.6 percent, and Portugal 5.7 percent.

   The stock market headed higher today, picking up
where it left off in Friday's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.72 to 2,630.33 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 579 up, 372 down and
530 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.50 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said stocks appeared to benefit from continuing hopes
that the Federal Reserve's gradual relaxation of its credit policy
would soften the impact of the recent slowing of economic growth.
   However, interest rates were flat to moderately higher in
today's credit market activity.
   Some observers believe the market in general has benefited from
the opening up of borders in Germany, which continued to make
headlines over the weekend.
   But the most notable response has been confined so far to stocks
of a few companies with extensive operations or investments in West
Germany.
   Among actively traded blue chips today, General Electric rose ]
to 55; American Express [ to 34}; McDonald's ] to 31|, and Philip
Morris \ to 42[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .26 to 188.16. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .56 at 372.03.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 21.92 to
2,625.62, closing out the week with a net loss of 3.90 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 890 up, 545 down and 503 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 131.80 million shares, against 143.39

<HEAD>K Mart Profits Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cutting prices to improve market share
contributed to a 17.5 percent drop in K mart Corp.'s third-quarter
profits, while sales rose 5.5 percent, the company said today.
   K mart reported net income of $104.1 million, or 52 cents a
share, for its third quarter ended Oct. 25, down from $126.1
million, or 63 cents a share, for the same period last year.
Revenue totaled $6.71 billion, up from $6.36 billion a year earlier.
   For the first 39 weeks of the year, K mart earned $343.2
million, or $1.71 a share, down 16.2 percent from $409.7 million,
or $2.04 a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue totaled
$19.78 billion, up 4.8 percent from $18.88 billion a year ago.
   Selling, general and administrative expenses remained stable
from one year to the next but K mart said interest expenses on debt
reached $50.9 million, up 34.5 percent, due to increased borrowing
in 1989.
   K mart Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph E. Antonini
had told an Oct. 10 news conference that price-cutting would hurt
third-quarter earnings.
   ``While gross margins have been affected by this pricing
strategy and this has had a negative short-term impact on earnings,
we are fully committed to maintaining our price leadership in the
industry,'' Antonini said today. ``The lowering of prices is an
essential part of a long-term strategy to improve our market share,
and we are confident that this will benefit future results.''
   K mart was the second-largest retailer after Sears, Roebuck and
Co. in 1988 with sales of $27.3 billion. As of Oct. 25, K mart had
4,171 outlets including 2,288 K mart discount stores, 1,258
Waldenbooks, 141 Builders Square and 282 Pay Less Drug stores.

   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. today
rejected Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s $3.13 billion takeover offer,
saying the $58-a-share bid was too low, would violate antitrust
laws and would damage both companies financially.
   Great Northern Chairman William R. Laidig said the $4.5 billion
in debt the companies would incur would turn both firms ``into one
highly leveraged junk company.''
   ``Georgia-Pacific's tender offer represents no more than an
attempt to take advantage of the industry's current short-term down
cycle and to seize for its own benefit the long-term values that
should belong to all shareholders,'' Laidig said in a letter to
stockholders.
   In a second letter to Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn
Jr., who two weeks ago bid for the paper products company, he
called the unsolicited proposal ``surprising and disturbing.''
   ``Had you discussed your ill-conceived proposal with us, we
would have done our best to dissuade you from taking this
unilateral action,'' Laidig said.
   A response from Georgia-Pacific was not immediately available.
   Great Northern stock fell $1.50 to $60.62{ a share in midday New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Great Northern, based in Norwalk, Conn., had sales of $3.6
billion in 1988 from its paper pulp, box, lumber and plywood
operations. The company owns 3.5 million acres of timberland and
has 20,000 employees at its mills and factories in Arkansas,
Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Mississippi and Wisconsin.
   The Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific had $9.5 billion in sales,
making paper, other forest products and building materials. It owns
6.5 million acres of timberland and 380 plants and mills employing
44,000 workers.
   Georgia-Pacific proposed to buy approximately 54 million
outstanding shares of Great Northern's common stock for $58 a
share, a 50 percent premium over the market price before the
takeover rumors drove up the price. The company said acquisition
would cost a total of $4.5 billion, including refinancing, fees and
expenses.
   The offer was the first unsolicited takeover bid in the U.S.
paper industry. It ended a week of takeover speculation that raised
Great Northern's stock price 50 percent, and prompted analysts to
predict that other paper and forest products companies may bid for
Great Northern.
   Hahn said at the time of the offer that the bid was friendly and
open to negotiation.
   He said the merged company would be more competitive globally
and would offer more job stability to Georgia-Pacific and Great
Northern employees.
   Laidig, however, called the offer ``distinctly unfriendly.'' He
said an unstable company would emerge from such a merger that
``would be forced to eliminate important and highly promising
programs now under way or planned by Great Northern Nekoosa.''

   Grain and soybean futures opened higher in active
trading this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices are getting support from ongoing dry conditions in
winter wheat crop areas. There also is speculation that the Soviet
Union will soon make an offer for U.S. wheat.
   Corn and soybean futures opened strong despite fears of
profit-taking.
   The early strength of the market is basically an extension of
Friday's rally, said analyst Mickey Luth of Shearson Lehman Hutton,
Inc. in Chicago.
   Friday's rally, which saw soybeans close at a five-week high,
followed the release Thursday of a crop report by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture which estimates that the nation's corn
and soybean crop will be larger than expected.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to a { cent higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.05 a bushel; corn was a

1 cent to 1} cents higher with December at $1.44{ a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 2{ cent higher with November at $5.77 a

   Livestock and pork futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .07 cent lower to .13 cent higher with December

   Livestock futures settled higher and pork futures were mixed in
Friday's trading.

<HEAD>In Effect, Henry George Said It: Taxes are Toxic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is a tax in America that, it is argued,
takes money from almost everyone, hinders economic progress,
penalizes the innovator and risk-taker, and rewards speculators.
   Oddly, the administering of this tax is adhered to by almost all
cities in America, even as some of their own leaders rail against
it, along with other advocates of repeal ranging from the
ultraliberal to ultraconservative.
   It is the real estate tax, generally assessed more heavily on
buildings and other improvements than on land, even in cities that
desperately need to rid themselves of empty lots and abandoned
structures.
   Steven B. Cord, a retired professor, has devoted years to
correcting this situation. Studies all over the world, he says,
demonstrate that cities improve once the burden of taxes is shifted
to land rather than structures.
   Why, then, has it not been accepted more widely? Could it be
that a stigma attaches to the notion, which is generally credited
to Henry George, the 19th century American economist, who believed
a tax on land was the only tax needed?
   George antagonized academic scholars, indicating they were
monkeys with microscopes. Modernized, that might suggest
computer-trained simians, a notion sufficient still to exclude a
wise man and his ideas from broad acceptance.
   Moreover, says Cord, to even allow cities to consider raising
taxes on land values and lowering them on improvements might
involve amendments to state constitutions, an impediment that can
discourage even zealots.
   George, nevertheless, has advocates, including academics. His
philosophy is expounded by the Henry George School in New York, and
by the nonprofit Center For the Study of Economics, based in
Columbia, Md., and run by Cord.
   And by people in power everywhere. More than 20 years ago, the
conclusion of a conference on the crisis of cities, attended by
elected officials, tax authorities, business people and academics
among others, concluded that real estate taxes were being applied
to produce the opposite of what was intended.
   In spite of this, very few cities tax land at higher rates than
structures, many of them prevented from doing so by state law.
Pennsylvania, with Pittsburgh the shining light, is an exception.
   In town after town in that commonwealth, says Cord, who for
years taught economics and history there _ at Indiana University,
Indiana, Penn. _ his studies show that reversing the usual formula
has led to strong development.
   It is only logical, he says. He and others who share his view
contend that the value of land rises because of the investments of
others in schools, buildings, bridges, sewers, power lines and
other improvements.
   In most if not all cities, these improvements are the basis of
jobs and other economic advances that benefit everyone, but perhaps
most especially the landowner who might have done nothing to
improve his property.
   In fact, unimproved property deprives the city of jobs and
revenues, and in some instances hinders other economic activity.
The owner takes little or no risk and pays low taxes, but is
rewarded by the risks and taxes of others.
   In some instances it can create a bizarre situation, in which
urban slum land slated for government-assisted development can rise
to higher values than in better neighborhoods, perhaps helping
landowners more than slum tenants.
   With core-city decay a problem almost everywhere, the issue has
become more relevant than ever. Advocates of land-value taxation
contend that the way taxes are applied now, it is cheaper to move
out of downtown than to build there.
   They contend that urban sprawl, which relentlessly devours the
countryside _attended by pollution and soaring land values and
taxes that deny young people the chance to buy a home _ is a
consequence of misapplication of urban taxes.
   Cord relentlessly pursues his goal, undismayed at the slow
progress. He believes that some advocates of Henry George's ideas
haven't acted practically, insisting an all-or-nothing approach
instead of advocating gradual change.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. has agreed to settle its patent
infringement lawsuits against Tandy Corp. and a Finnish firm, the
companies announced in a joint statement.
   The electronics giant, based in suburban Schaumburg, Ill., had
alleged that Tandy and Nokia Corp. of Helsinki, Finland, had
violated its cellular telephone patents.
   Under the settlement, Tandy _ based in Fort Worth, Texas _ and
Nokia ``have agreed to a license under certain Motorola patents and
to settle with Motorola on its other claims,'' the companies said
in a statement Sunday.
   The other claims included damages for past infringement of
Motorola's cellular telephone patents and an injunction barring
importation and sale of the Tandy and Nokia cellular phones that
use technology protected by Motorola's patents, Motorola said.
   ``There were no admissions of liability on any side,'' the
companies said.
   Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
   Motorola filed suit against the two firms before the
International Trade Commission in April and in U.S. District Court
in Chicago, alleging that seven of its cellular telephone patents
had been infringed upon.
   The ITC granted Motorola a temporary exclusion order against
Tandy and Nokia cellular phones in August after determining that
two of Motorola's patents likely were infringed, Motorola said in a
news release.
   The ITC proceedings and the federal court case will be dismissed
if the trade commission accepts the settlement, which is expected,
the joint statement said.

<HEAD>UPDATES throughout with closing prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shares on London's Stock Exchange closed modestly
lower in thin volume Monday, largely pressured by a downturn on
Wall Street.
   The FT-SE 100-share index settled 3.5 points, or 0.15 percent,
lower at 2,213.2, just off its session low of 2,211.5 and
substantially below the day's high of 2,233.8.
   Dealers said the market wasn't able to sustain its early
technical gains, which brought the key index back to where it stood
before Wall Street's Oct. 13 stock plunge and the subsequent
tailspin in world equity markets.
   The FT 30-share index finished 1.6 points lower at 1,771.4.
Volume was 286.8 million shares traded, down from 480.7 million
shares on Friday and among the thinnest sessions this year. The FT
500-share index was 1,216.03, down 2.13.
   ``The market moved up on extremely thin volume,'' a senior
dealer with UBS Phillips and Drew said. ``But there was a great
deal of expectation Wall Street would open weaker. It didn't take
much to knock London down.''
   Besides Wall Street's failure to move higher after Friday's
sharp gains, dealers said London's confidence was shaken late in
the session by at least one modest and broad-based program trade
executed by Phillips and Drew. The program, which the brokerage
said comprised the sale and purchase of an equal number of shares
amounting to total turnover of 6 million shares, was read as a
flurry of selling by the market.
   ``The market read it wrong,'' the Phillips and Drew dealer said.
``They thought it was more selling than it was. It just shows how
nervous London is.''

<HEAD>Court OKs Testing of Boston Police Officers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today permitted random drug
testing of Boston police officers, providing new evidence that the
justices are willing to allow widespread testing of government
employees in jobs affecting public safety.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that forcing
police officers to undergo the tests _ even when there is no reason
to suspect drug abuse _ does not violate their privacy rights.
   In its first drug-testing rulings last March, the court upheld
drug and alcohol tests for railway workers involved in accidents
and U.S. Customs Service employees applying for drug-enforcement
jobs or those positions that require carrying a firearm.
   Neither of those rulings directly addressed the question of
random tests, however.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals nevertheless relied on
those decisions in upholding the constitutionality of random
urinalysis tests for Boston police officers who carry firearms or
enforce drug laws.
   The appeals court last May overturned a federal judge's decision
that the tests violate the officers' rights.
   ``Since we can find no relevant distinction between a customs
officer and a police officer, we hold the police department's
drug-testing rule to be constitutional,'' the appeals court said.
   The Boston Police Patrolmen's Association, in seeking to ban the
tests, said the Boston policy is more far-reaching than that
governing the customs officers.
   The customs workers have to undergo tests only if they ``seek
promotion or transfer to safety-sensitive positions'' and not if
they remain in their current jobs, the police union argued.
   The union said privacy rights of its members were being
sacrificed to ``exaggerated fears'' of drug use.
   American society ``has always been willing to accept certain
risks in exchange for the freedom it so cherishes _ but which
appears to be so rapidly dwindling,'' the union's lawyers said.
   U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton, who was overruled by the
1st Circuit court, said the Boston tests were unjustified because
the same purpose could be accomplished by testing individual
officers when there was reason to believe they are using drugs.
   ``Despite the intensive media attention devoted to drug abuse,
(the department) has proffered no evidence that any police
department in the nation suffers from a drug abuse problem,''
Keeton said.
   Department officials said the tests are needed to assure public
confidence and to prevent officers from becoming susceptible to
bribery because of a drug habit.
   The case is Guiney vs. Roache, 89-205.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   NEWSPAPERS
   
   An evenly divided court upheld the planned partial merger of
Detroit's two daily newspapers.
   The justices, by a 4-4 vote, affirmed a ruling that former
Attorney General Edwin Meese III acted reasonably last year when he
approved a joint operating agreement for the two papers, the
Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News.
   The federal Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 authorizes the
attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an
exemption from federal antitrust laws. Today's ruling was the
court's first on a joint operating agreement between newspapers.
   The partial merger had been challenged by a group of Michigan
advertisers and readers.
   Today's 4-4 split, which under the high court's rules
automatically upheld a federal appeals court's decision, was set up
when Justice Byron R. White disqualified himself from the case for
unexplained ``personal reasons.''
   A 4-4 vote by the justices sets no binding precedent for similar
controversies in the future, mainly because there is no clue as to
the reasoning of any justice.
   The case is Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press vs.
Thornburgh, 88-1640.
   
   DRUG TESTING
   
   The court permitted random drug testing of Boston police
officers, providing new evidence the justices are willing to allow
widespread testing of government employees in jobs affecting public
safety.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that forcing
police officers to undergo the tests _ even when there is no reason
to suspect drug abuse _ does not violate their privacy rights.

<HEAD>HBJ Reports $102.7 Million 3rd Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. said Monday
it lost more than $100 million in the third quarter because of
cutbacks in public funding for educational materials and nearly
$176 million in write-offs.
   But the Orlando-based publisher and insurance carrier predicted
a large fourth-quarter gain after closing a $1.1 billion deal with
an Anheuser-Busch Co. subsidiary to acquire six HBJ theme parks.
   The sale, expected to be completed later this month, should help
HBJ reduce an estimated $2.9 billion in debt accumulated to fend
off a hostile takeover by British communications mogul Robert
Maxwell in 1987.
   For the three-month period ending Sept. 30, HBJ reported a net
loss of $102.7 million, or $1.41 a share, on revenue of $470.1
million. That compared with net income of $60.2 million, or 99
cents a share, on revenue of $463.2 million for the same 1988
period.
   The losses are calculated after issuing dividends on preferred
stock.
   The company blamed some of its losses on a sharp decline in
expenditures for public school textbooks and related materials.
   HBJ said more than half of its $176 million third-quarter
write-offs were linked to the development of the new school texts
and materials prior to the late-summer downturn.
   Efforts to streamline operations have included consolidating
textbook sales for HBJ and Holt, Rineheart and Winston, an Austin,
Texas-based subsidiary.
   On July 1, HBJ took over textbooks sales for kindergarten to
grade eight, and Holt, Rinehart was made responsible for grades
seven through 12.
   Both companies also have reduced the number of auxiliary
education materials offered to schools.
   HBJ's insurance division, which accounted for $120.7 million of
third-quarter revenue, recently signed a letter of intent for the
$27 million acquisition of American Pioneer Life Insurance Co.,
which would be its third acquisition this year.
   For the first nine months of the year, the company reported a
net loss $295.2 million, or $4.05 a share, on revenue of $1.04
billion, compared with a net loss of $54.8 million, or 91 cents a
share, on revenue of $966.9 million last year.

   The stock market showed some spotty gains today
in an on-again, off-again session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.07 points to
2,636.68 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers held a narrow edge on losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 700 up, 669 down and
541 unchanged.
   Analysts said many traders remained hopeful that the Federal
Reserve's gradual relaxation of its credit policy would soften the
impact of the recent slowing of economic growth.
   However, interest rates were flat to moderately higher in
today's credit market activity.
   Some observers believe the market in general stands to benefit
from the opening up of borders in Germany, which continued to make
headlines over the weekend.
   But the most notable response among investors has been confined
so far to stocks of a few companies with extensive operations or
investments in West Germany.
   Dallas Corp., which agreed to be acquired by a subsidiary of
Bessemer Securities for $24 a share, jumped 9{ to 23|.
   Avon Products dropped 1 to 35{ after the company said it wasn't

   The U.S. dollar finished mixed Monday against
major foreign currencies in trading in Europe. Gold prices rose
sharply.
   Dealers said the West German mark regained some lost ground as
traders speculated that a flood of East Germans into West Germany
would help, rather than harm, the West German economy.
   The market is also awaiting this week's release of U.S. economic
statistics for a clearer indication of economic trends.
   On Tuesday, the U.S. government plans to release figures on
retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization. The
latest U.S. trade figures will be released Thursday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 143.55 Japanese yen from
142.75 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 143.68
yen.
   But the dollar fell against the British pound. In London, the
British pound rose to $1.5805 from $1.5765 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.8615 West German marks, down from 1.8625;
1.6410 Swiss francs, up from 1.6370; 6.3140 French francs, up from

   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $391.25 a troy ounce, up
from $386.00 late Friday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing
bid of $390.00 an ounce, up from $384.50 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.25 an ounce to close at

   The Boeing Co. pleaded guilty today to
two felony charges of ``unauthorized conveyance'' of secret
Pentagon budget documents and agreed to pay more than $5.2 million
in fines and restitution.
   U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III accepted the plea, entered by
attorney Robert S. Bennett, after questioning company and
government lawyers for nearly an hour. He said he was concerned
that the plea and penalties agreed to might not sufficiently cover
what he called ``a very serious breach of security.''
   Ellis said he wanted a ``clear indication that the disposition
bears a rational relationship to the injury to the United States
and reflects an awareness on the part of the Being Co. of the
gravity of it.''
   ``I want to be sure that the penalty is appropriate to what I
consider to be a serious violation of the law,'' Ellis said.
   The judge criticized Boeing for not sending a corporate officer
from the Seattle-based aerospace firm to be present for the guilty
plea and sentence. ``I think you would have done well to have
someone here to accept responsibility as officer of the company,''
Ellis told Bennett.
   The judge said he would require the corporation's board chairman
to write a letter to him expressing ``the typical contrition that
any defendant would express.''
   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said the company did
consider sending a corporate officer to the hearing, but ``we
relied on advice from counsel and followed court rules on how a
company enters a plea'' in deciding not to send an executive
representative. ``We did have representation from (Seattle-based)
company senior counsel who has dealt closely with the
investigation.''
   ``Obviously we take this very seriously,'' Binder said. ``I
think to put it in context, these are events that occurred from
1978 until 1985 and I think from the time that it was discovered,
we strengthened our procedures and internal controls and enhanced
training to assure that similar incidents do not occur.''
   Binder said ``there are no longer any employees with the company
who have been implicated'' in the case.
   ``We have taken every step possible to assure that similar
incidents do not occur,'' he said. ``The government said in the
plea agreement that Boeing cooperated fully with the investigation
and that the government has no evidence of any unlawful conveyance
of classified documents by Boeing after 1985.''
   Binder said Boeing would send the letter ordered by Ellis. The
company's chairman and chief executive officer is Frank Shrontz.
   Boeing had government contract sales in 1988 totaling $4.792
billion, and $4.2 billion in the first nine months of this year,
Binder said.
   Ellis fined Boeing $20,000 and ordered it to pay $5.2 million in
restitution, which covers the cost of the government investigation
and the value of the two documents that had been illegally
obtained. The figure also includes $200,000 worth of expenses
Boeing incurred to keep former marketing analysis Richard Fowler on
its payroll.
   Fowler is awaiting trial on 39 counts of conspiracy and unlawful
conveyance of 107 classified documents to Boeing between 1979 and
1985, including studies of President Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   Boeing admitted that it accepted two 1984 planning and budget
documents classified secret from Fuller, who is scheduled to go on
trial next month.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Bellows said the Justice
Department is continuing its investigation to determine who in the
Pentagon gave the documents to Fowler, who had worked as a civilian
Air Force employee before joining Boeing.
   Ellis repeatedly pressed the prosecutor about whether
investigators were satisfied that no other Boeing officials could
be prosecuted.
   ``For a group of people in a company to know they have these
documents and take no action is fairly arresting,'' Ellis said.
   Bellows said investigators were unable to prove that other
Boeing officials, including Fowler's immediate superior, knowingly
accepted the classified documents in violation of the law.
   The prosecutor said Boeing did not use the documents to obtain a
contract, such as in the ``Ill Wind'' Pentagon procurement scandal.
Instead the company used the information for general budget and
planning purposes.
   Nevertheless, Bennett conceded, ``There is no question Boeing
should not have had these documents.''
   ``Today, as far as the company is concerned, is a very sad day
in its history,'' Bennett said.
   Bellows said a half-dozen current and former Boeing employees
had been given immunity from prosecution in return for their
cooperation in the case against Fowler. The prosecutor said the
government would seek a court order to revoke the security
clearances of those witnesses still working for Boeing.
   Bellows noted that Boeing or some of its subsidiaries could be
suspended or barred from receiving Pengaton contracts as a result
of the guilty plea. Air Force officials are reviewing the case, he
said.
   In addition, Bellows said prosecutors are investigating other
companies whose employees also received Pentagon documents from
Fowler. But is likely that the government will not be able to
prosecute several of these companies because the statute of
limitations on the alleged offenses is about to expire, he said.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mixed in
moderate trading Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures opened strong, but came under pressure because of
an absence of export business, said analyst Dale Gustafson of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   Commercial selling sent new crop futures lower, although
Gustafson noted that reports of dry conditions in red winter wheat
areas helped prices.
   Corn moved only fractionally upward on commercial buying and
ongoing speculation about more export business to the Soviet Union.
   Gustafson said soybeans were strong, extending Friday's rally.
Soybean prices also were boosted by a strong cash market and
reports that Brazil's soybean planting lags well behind normal.
   At the close, wheat prices were 2{ cents to 6{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.02 a bushel; corn was {

<HEAD>K mart's Profit Drops 17.5 Percent; Dayton Hudson Has Strong Income
Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp. on Monday announced a 17.5 percent drop in its
third-quarter earnings as profit margins were squeezed by lower
prices on merchandise. The big discounter said revenue rose 5.5
percent.
   Department store operator Dayton Hudson Corp., which also is the
parent of one of the country's leading discount chains, reported
its income surged 39 percent on nearly a 13 percent gain in revenue.
   K mart, the country's second largest retailer after Sears,
Roebuck and Co., said its after-tax income was $104.1 million, or
52 cents a share, in the three months ended Oct. 25, down from
$126.1 million, or 63 cents a share, in the comparable 1988 quarter.
   Revenue totaled $6.71 billion, up from $6.36 billion a year
earlier.
   For the first 9 months of the year, K mart earned $343.2
million, or $1.71 a share, down 16.2 percent from $409.7 million,
or $2.04 a share, a year earlier. Revenue came to $19.78 billion,
up 4.8 percent from $18.88 billion.
   The gross margin for the quarter shrank to 26.5 percent of sales
from 26.9 percent and K mart attributed the narrowing to lower
everyday shelf prices.
   Most costs were stable except for interest expense on debt,
which reached $50.9 million, up 34.5 percent, due to increased
borrowings in 1989.
   The deterioration in K mart's profitability didn't come as a
surprise. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph E. Antonini
had told an Oct. 10 news conference that price-cutting would impair
earnings in the short run.
   He said in a news release Monday that K mart remains ``committed
to maintaining our price leadership in the industry'' despite the
negative short-term impact.
   ``The lowering of prices is an essential part of a long-term
strategy to improve our market share, and we are confident that
this will benefit future results,'' he said.
   At the end of the third quarter, K mart, based in Troy, Mich.,
had 4,171 outlets including 2,288 K mart discount stores, 1,258
Waldenbooks, 141 Builders Square and 282 Pay Less Drug stores.
   Separately, Dayton Hudson said its earnings rose to $64 million,
or 83 cents a share, in the quarter ended Oct. 28 from last year's
$46 million, or 54 cents a share.
   Revenue rose to $3.24 billion from $2.87 billion in last year's
third quarter.
   Nine-month earnings increased 52 percent to $160 million, or
$2.06 per share, from $105 million, or $1.24 per share, for the
corresponding 1988 period. Revenue through three quarters of this
year amounted to $9.16 billion, up 13 percent from $8.10 billion a
year earlier.
   Kenneth A. Macke, Dayton Hudson's chairman and chief executive
officer, predicted a strong fourth quarter.
   ``Our inventories are in good shape and we're excited about the
holiday season,'' he said in a news release.
   Operating profit of Dayton Hudson's three major divisions
increased 31 percent in the first nine months of the year, with the
performance of the Mervyn's chain leading the way. The company said
Mervyn's performance was due to strong sales, improved gross
margins and continued expense control.
   The company said its Target discount chain had a strong increase
driven by improved sales while the Dayton Hudson Department Store
Co. continued to show solid profit growth.
   During the third quarter, Dayton Hudson opened nine Target
stores and three Mervyn's stores, completing its 1989 expansion
program of 69 store openings. The corporation said it plans to open
28 more Target stores and seven Mervyn's in 1990.
   At the end of the third quarter, Dayton Hudson had 659 stores in
33 states.

<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO opened its 18th biennial
convention Monday basking in its contribution to the success of
Poland's Solidarity union and determined to adopt a more militant
stance at home as a difficult decade draws to a close.
   Opening the gathering on an upbeat note, Federation President
Lane Kirkland said, ``For all our failings and flaws and unmet
goals, the plain fact is that the American Federation of Labor and
Congress of Industrial Organizations is and will remain the largest
and most active body of free and democratic trade unionists in the
world.''
   Kirkland delivered a partisan speech to nearly 800 delegates,
denouncing policies of both the Reagan and Bush administrations and
predicting attitudes toward unions will improve as the legacy of
the 1980s becomes clearer.
   ``The bills are coming due and the ticking time bombs are going
off,'' Kirkland said. ``It is morning after in America,'' he said,
putting a negative twist on Ronald Reagan's morning-in-America
campaign theme of 1984.
   Kirkland attacked government corruption, federal deregulation,
debt-ridden leveraged buyouts in private business and what he said
was the exportation of American jobs to cheap labor markets abroad.
   The schedule for the week-long convention of the 14.1
million-member federation includes a mix of celebration and
solemnity, with the Tuesday appearance by Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa the highlight of a gathering that will also include
addresses by President Bush and Democratic congressional leaders.
   Also on tap are the elections of new officers, with Kirkland
assured of a sixth two-year term, the welcoming back into the
federation of the United Mine Workers 40 years after that union
pulled out of the umbrella organization, and renewed efforts to
assist workers involved in a number of major strikes, including
those against Eastern Airlines, NYNEX Corp., Pittston Coal Group
and Boeing.
   In a noisy demonstration of solidarity, hundreds of strikers
from those companies as well as striking Las Vegas musicians staged
a late afternoon march through the convention hall.
   With ``solidarity'' as the convention theme, Kirkland urged the
delegates to offer a warm welcome to Walesa and wished aloud that
the U.S. labor movement's part in the success of Solidarity and
trade unions in other Eastern European nations ``will provide a new
lesson for Americans regarding the role of trade unions in
promoting and preserving freedom in our own country.''
   ``In every quarter of the globe, events are in the saddle and
are driving the reluctant leaders they have overtaken,'' he said.
``The AFL-CIO has been a staunch ally and resource upon which these
movements have drawn and the demands upon us will multiply as more
and more of the world's workers rise to their feet and assert their
rights.'
   To that end, Kirkland and other federation leaders planned
private meetings with Walesa to determine how U.S. unions can best
help Solidarity now that it controls Poland's government and to
seek guidance on how to emulate in other nations the federation's
$5 million effort to help Solidarity during the past eight years.
   On the domestic front, Kirkland left little doubt that organized
labor planned to take a more aggressive stance both in organizing
in fast-growing parts of the economy and in trying to protect its
traditional base in industry.
   ``Solidarity has helped us weather the harsh climate of the
1980s, unimpaired in vigor and tougher in spirit and resolve for
the experience,'' Kirkland said.
   Bush is to address the convention Wednesday, with the recent
compromise with labor over raising the minimum wage providing a
positive note for his appearance, the first before an AFL-CIO
convention by a U.S. president since Jimmy Carter in 1979.
   But Kirkland, while avoiding mentioning Bush by name, left
little doubt that labor remained dissatisfied with him. He took
particular aim at the strenuous, though unsuccessful, efforts by
Bush and Republicans in Congress to pass a constitutional amendment
banning flag burning.
   ``Is it not time our elected representatives turn their
attention to the real flag burners in our country?'' he said.
``What about those employers who practice transitory allegiance to
the flag of any nation that will provide them with the cheapest and
most repressed labor in the world.''
   Kirkland said, ``We sound the call for attention to real
problems and away from the false alarms of diversionists who blow
the smoke of phony patriotism in the eyes of the public.''
   The delegates heard Monday afternoon from Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole and House Speaker Thomas Foley, both of whom hailed
the federation for its international activities.
   ``When the story of ourtime is written, it will reflect the fact
that fredom has to do with labor and that one of the motivating
forces influencing this tide of democracy was the AFL-CIO,'' Mrs.
Dole said.
   Foley thanked the federation for its support of Democratic Party
candidates and promised to push for passage of a labor legislative
agenda, specifically promising swift action on measures dealing
with child care, parental leave.

<HEAD>Falling Interest Rates Push Gold Prices Higher</HEAD>

   Precious metal futures prices surged Monday on New York's
Commodity Exchange as investors reacted to recent economic
developments and indications that interest rates might decline.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures were mixed, energy
futures fell sharply, sugar prices declined and livestock and pork
futures mostly were higher.
   Gold settled $4.10 to $5.10 higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $392.70 a troy ounce; silver was 5.8 cents
to 6.5 cents higher with December at $5.318 a troy ounce.
   The buying trend for gold and silver started in Japan, continued
later in London when trading there began Monday morning and
followed through in New York, said analyst Stephen W. Platt of Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Platt said the rally in gold stemmed partly from the metal's
success in surpassing and remaining above technically significant
price levels.
   ``Buying also was linked to the impression that interest rates
are going down and uncertainty on the East European situation and
its impact on the European economy,'' Platt said.
   Platt said silver prices rose on spillover buying from gold and
on bargain hunting by investors.
   Energy futures were down on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
investors reacted to reports that the 13-member Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries exceeded its 20.5 million barrels per
day production ceiling by 3 million barrels last month.
   Michael Rothman of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York
said technical factors also came into play Monday, but the fall in
prices stemmed primarily from the production figures.
   The slowing in the growth in demand for OPEC oil could cause
crude prices to fall further if production remains at current
levels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 17 cents to 25 cents lower
with December at $19.59 a barrel; heating oil was .76 cent to .90
cent lower with December at 57.68 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .76 cent to .97 cent lower with December at 51.06 cents a
gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mixed in moderate trading on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures came under pressure because of an absence of
export business, said analyst Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. in Chicago. Commercial selling sent new crop futures
lower, although Gustafson said reports of dry conditions in red
winter wheat areas helped prices.
   Corn rose fractionally on commercial buying and ongoing
speculation about increased export business to the Soviet Union.
   Gustafson said soybeans were strong, extending Friday's rally.
Soybean prices also were boosted by a strong cash market and
reports that Brazil's soybean planting was lagging well behind
normal.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 6{ cents lower with December at $4.02
a bushel; corn was a { cent lower to \ cent higher with December at
$2.38\ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{ cents higher with December
at $1.44\ a bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents to 3{ cents higher with
November at $5.78 a bushel.
   Sugar futures declined sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar and
Cocoa Exchange as profit-taking set in following several days of
price increases.
   The decline may have been helped by reports that Brazil sold
sugar over the weekend. Prices rose last week partially on fears
Brazil would not be able to meet its export commitments.
   Sugar was .13 cent to .32 cent lower with March at 14.87 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher in sluggish trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The pork price rise was paced by frozen pork bellies, which
soared on commission house buying. Hog futures were supported by
expectation of steady pork product prices.
   Cattle futures were steady, supported by spillover strength from
pork and firm fed cattle prices.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .12 cent higher with December
at 74.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to .30 cent
higher with November at 83.30 cents a pound; hogs were .42 cent to
.93 cent higher with December at 48.62 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.85 cents to 1.95 cents higher with February at 65.15
cents a pound.

   Cosmetics company Avon Products Inc. on Monday
sought to repel unwanted takeover advances from an alliance of
powerful investors including oil heir Gordon P. Getty, a senior
Mary Kay Corp. executive and the Fisher real estate family of New
York.
   A limited partnership called Chartwell Associates, revealing its
intentions after it became known Friday that the group had bought a
stake in Avon, said it may propose a merger between Avon and itself
or one of its affiliates.
   In a summary of a document filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Chartwell Associates LP disclosed that it owns
6.9 percent of Avon's common stock and intends to purchase
additional shares.
   An Avon spokesman said the company continues to believe that
Avon is better off on its own, a position the board of directors
steadfastly maintained when rejecting previous takeover proposals
this year.
   ``The board of directors' position is that the company is not
for sale,'' Avon spokesman John Cox said. ``The best interests of
the shareholders would be served by Avon remaining an independent
company.''
   Cox declined to comment on whether Avon's board had scheduled a
special meeting to consider Chartwell's interest. He said board
members had been advised about the situation over the weekend by
management.
   Wall Street reacted coolly to the latest developments in
contrast to the enthusiastic buying Friday after Avon announced it
had been notified that Chartwell held more than 5 percent of its
stock.
   Avon's stock dropped $1.50 to close at $35 a share in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading, erasing a portion of
Friday's $5.50 gain.
   Investors apparently were skeptical about the chances for a
significant increase in the stock value given that Avon seems
unwilling to enter any merger discussions.
   Earlier this year Avon spurned several suitors.
   It turned down takeover offers from Amway Corp., an Ada,
Mich.-based direct-selling concern, and from investor Irwin Jacobs.
Amway made a bid of $2.1 billion and Jacobs' was worth $2.85
billion. Together, Amway and Jacobs hold about 10 percent of Avon's
stock.
   Avon also shunned takeover feelers from Mary Kay Corp. Vice
Chairman John P. Rochon, who is involved in the newest advance on
New York-based Avon.
   The Chartwell group hasn't mentioned a price it would bid if it
decides to pursue Avon.
   In the event of a takeover, Rochon ruled out the possibility of
uniting the sales forces of Avon and Mary Kay. He also said in the
summary of the SEC filing that Avon wouldn't be merged with Mary
Kay, a Dallas-based door-to-door marketer of beauty products.
   Other options that will be reviewed by Chartwell include
purchasing more Avon shares and launching a tender offer to buy
stock from shareholders, seeking to influence the management and
policies of Avon in some unspecified way, or trying to put a
nominee on Avon's board. Another option would be to sell some of
its Avon stock on the open market or in private transactions.
   The general partners of Chartwell have been identified as Larry,
Zachery, Arnold, Richard and Anthony Fisher, a family of New York
property developers, and Argonaut Partners I, headed by Rochon. The
only limited partner is the Gordon P. Getty Family Trust.
   Within Argonaut is a group called New Arrow Corp., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc., the principal unit of
privately held Mary Kay Corp., which had revenue of about $400
million last year.
   There has been speculation on Wall Street that Avon could have
difficulty defending itself against Chartwell due to the
significant financial clout of Getty and the Fishers. Getty and the
Fisher brothers teamed up earlier this year in a bid for Emhart
Corp. that, though unsuccessful, was believed tohave earned the
partners tens of millions of dollars.

<HEAD>'486 Computers the Next Big Thing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What have been called the Maseratis of personal
computers, super-fast machines based on Intel Corp.'s new i486
microprocessor, took center stage at the world's biggest computer
expo Monday.
   The new personal computers on display at the fall Comdex show
are so fast they are expected to do work that otherwise would have
gone to larger and more expensive minicomputers and even mainframes.
   Buyers are learning to hook together and manage whole networks
of personal computers to run their businesses.
   ``In the beginning, PCs were considered toys, they were
automated typewriters,'' said Joe Nahil, the chief spokesman for
Compaq Computer Corp., which is at the forefront of the 486-based
computer invasion.
   486 is shorthand for Intel's i486, the central chip in the new
generation of personal computers.
   Compaq's new top-end 486 models can store up to 4 billion
characters of information at a pricetag from $15,000 up to $50,000
for specialized PCs that control networks.
   If that sounds expensive, consider that they are replacing
machinery that costs far more.
   ``We're talking about using them to replace mainframes,'' said
Alan Gregolot of International Business Machines Corp., which was
the first company to ship a commercial product using the 486 chips.
   But competitors including Compaq and Hewlett-Packard Co. say
that because IBM's Power Platform, which contains the chip, merely
replaces a 386-based board in an existing computer, it does not
take advantage of the speed and power of the 486 chips the way
their computers, specifically built around the 486, can do.
   Be that as it may, Gregolot was demonstrating Monday how the
entire property records for a small city, including changes in lot
lines over the years, the location of every power pole, and the
history of every piece of equipment attached to the pole, can be
contained and managed in a machine that sits on a desk.
   ``Right now property appraisers in many cities still have
draftsmen drawing lots by hand,'' Gregolot said.
   With a program managed by the 486-based computer, information
about, say, a zoning change could be called up immediately,
graphically displayed on a printout and fed into envelopes
addressed to neighbors who might want to object to the change.
   There were about a dozen of the 486-based PCs on display Monday
at Comdex, the huge annual trade show held in Las Vegas each fall.
   Still, observers expect many businesses to put off buying one of
the machines. Flaws in Intel's 486 chips forced delays in Compaq's
release schedule for the new computers, and IBM is working on
computers designed to specifically take advantage of the 486 chips
instead of merely putting them into a machine originally designed
for the Intel 80386 microprocessor, which works only about half as
fast.
   IBM got a bigger chunk of the 386-based PC market than Compaq
for the first time in the July-September quarter, and IBM's prices
for its computers based on Intel 286 and 386 chips are cheaper than
Compaq's, according to Stephen Smith, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst.
   But Compaq's move up with the 486-based computers appears to
position it squarely amid the market for the specialized PCs that
control networks. Sales of the so-called network servers are
booming at a time when sales growth of regular personal compters
has slowed to 10 percent a year.
   ``We think IBM is in big trouble,'' said Nihal, the Compaq
spokesman.

<HEAD>Realtors Says Housing Demand Will Stay Strong</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Price List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The changing make-up of the American family will
offset declining population and keep demand for housing strong
during the 1990s, according to a study released Monday.
   The Realtors, meeting in Dallas, also released quarterly surveys
of house prices and sales, showing a 2.7 percent increase in resale
prices of single family houses, spurred by lower interest rates and
recovering markets in the South and Midwest.
   Meanwhile, the national median price for a house rose 2.1
percent to $95,000 although there were wide regional differences,
the Realtors said.
   ``What we've got here is a picture of a housing market in which
activity remains historically strong, but varies across the
country,'' said John Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist.
``It's a market in which home prices are appreciating slightly
greater than the rate of inflation, but again with strong regional
variations.''
   The study, ``Demographics in the U.S.: The Segmenting of Housing
Demand,'' concluded the market for housing will be driven by
changes in character of the nation's population.
   ``Households comprised of a husband, wife and children, having
comparable incomes, and manifesting similar housing needs no long
comprise the overwhelming majority of U.S. households,'' the study
says.
   ``Today's households include large and increasing contingents of
singles, single-parents, cohabiting couples, elderly, immigrants,
affluent and poor,'' the study says. ``Moreover, regional
disparities in housing demand, already substantial, are likely to
heighten as mobility, migration and immigration rates also continue
to increase.''
   The study says these changes will negate the effects of a
declining population in the post-baby boom generation.
   ``As the leading edge of the baby boom moves through its peak
earning years, demand will pick up for second homes and retirement
homes,'' Tuccillo said. Demand will shift to ``smaller units in
sunny climates.''
   ``High levels of migration and immigration will continue to mean
high levels of housing demand in selected areas, for example in the
South and West regions,'' the study says. ``Increasing population
mobility coupled with increasing fluidity among household types is
likely to mean higher rates of housing turnover throughout the
country.''
   ``The healthy markets will offer diversity,'' said outgoing
President Ira Gribin. ``They will have a variety of niche-oriented
housing.''
   Some of these niches identified include trade-ups for current
home-owners, or smaller homes for retired persons.
   The study also found a growing disparity in housing
affordability between the highest and lowest income groups.
   ``Households toward the upper end of the income and wealth
distributions are seen as enjoying sizeable gains in affluence,
thereby permitting substantially increased housing consumption, for
example, by homeowners `moving up.'
   ``On the other hand, households near the lower end of the
distributions _ whether because of lagging real earnings, increased
single-parent households, or ill-fortune _ appear to be having
increasing difficulty in obtaining suitable low-cost housing,'' the
study says.
   As a result, affordable housing is perceived as an increasing
problem for many U.S. families and individuals.
   Meanwhile, the Realtors' found prices and activity were on the
upswing in much of the country, although even within regions there
were significant differences.
   Nationally, the median price was $95,000, up from $93,000 in the
second quarter this year and a 5.3 percent increase from the third
quarter last year.
   The Northeast region remains the most expensive, with a median
price of $147,000, up from $145,900 in the second quarter, but just
a 1.5 percent rise from the third quarter last year.
   Houses in the West have appreciated the most, jumping 11.7
percent from $126,800 last year to $141,600 this year.
   The South's median price was $85,800, an increase from the
second quarter's $83,800 and a 3.1 percent from the same quarter
last year. In the Midwest, the median price was $72,400, up from
the second quarter's $70,900 and a 5.1 percent rise from last
year's $68,900.
   South Dakota saw the largest percentage jump in resale of
existing single-family detached homes, town houses, apartment
condominiums and co-operatives, increasing 31.6 percent from the
second quarter. In all, 36 states and Washington, D.C., had
increased resales.
   Utah has the largest decrease, as resales there fell 14.6
percent.
   California led in the number of sales with 501,600, almost twice
as much as second-place Pennsylvania at 259,900. Placing third with
226,500 sales was Texas, where real estate values have been
depressed following the collapse of energy prices in the mid-1980s.
   Honolulu and the San Francisco Bay area remained the most
expensive areas, with median home prices of $275,000 in Honolulu
and $269,400 in San Francisco. Orange County, Calif., is the third
most expensive at $249,100 followed by Los Angeles at $224,600.
   Peoria, Ill., remained the least expensive, with a median price
of $48,700, followed by Spokane, Wash., at $52,700.

   Oil futures prices declined Monday in light
trading amid persistent concern about reports of higher OPEC
production and lower oil demand.
   In futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade
of U.S. crude oil, fell 25 cents to finish at $19.59 per 42-gallon
barrel. Contracts for later delivery lost 17 cents or 18 cents a
barrel.
   In recent days, traders have turned their attention increasingly
to reports of overproduction by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   OPEC is expected to discuss production strategy for 1990 as well
as reallocation of output quotas at its Nov. 25 meeting in Vienna,
Austria.
   ``The overall picture going into the OPEC meeting is quite
ominous,'' said Nauman Barakat, a first vice president of energy
futures at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Unseasonably warm weather in parts of the United States has
deepened the market's bearish sentiment, he noted.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
unleaded gasoline for December slipped 0.76 cent to 51.06 cents a
gallon. Contracts for later delivery posted steeper declines.
   Wholesale heating oil for December ended 0.77 cent lower at
57.68 cents a gallon, while most later-delivery contracts fell
further.

   Boeing Co. is concentrating more on efforts to
get a vote by striking production workers on a contract offer than
on getting talks going again, a company spokesman said Monday.
   On the 40th day of the walkout, Paul Binder of Boeing said
company officials had not decided whether they would be willing to
resume negotiations with the Machinists union in the absence of a
vote.
   ``We haven't taken any kind of position on that,'' he said.
``What we would like to do is to encourage a membership vote.''
   Federal mediator Doug Hammond, who has reconvened the bargaining
teams twice without success since the strike began Oct. 4, said he
didn't know when he might make a third attempt.
   Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751, said
there was still time to reach a settlement before Thanksgiving.
   ``I just hope that something will break here,'' Baker said.
``I'd hope that they won't force the membership to go through any
holidays, Thanksgiving and so on.''
   The union represents about 57,800 Boeing workers, including
43,300 in the local district lodge; 12,000 in Wichita, Kan.; 1,700
in Portland, Ore.; and a few hundred at scattered sites in
California, Hawaii, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota and other
states.
   The latest talks ended Nov. 4 after six days, with Boeing
offering a 3-year contract calling for wage increases of 4 percent,
3 percent and 3 percent; annual bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay,
4 percent and 4 percent; a reduction in mandatory overtime from the
current 200 hours a quarter to 144 hours by mid-1990, and
across-the-board increases in retirement benefits.
   Machinist union leaders rejected the offer, saying it provided
no more money than the one spurned in an 85 percent strike vote on
Oct. 3.
   Reiterating that there would be no increase in the money
package, Boeing officials have issued public statements, taken out
full-page newspaper ads and mailed letters to the strikers' homes
in a campaign for a vote on the offer.
   Binder said that in ``close to 2,000 calls'' to a company
information phone line over the past week, most of those expressing
an opinion said they favored a vote.
   Baker said Boeing's campaign actually boosted support for union
negotiators after widespread disappointment following the collapse
in talks.
   He said the number of hourly workers crossing picket lines in
recent days was less than 2 percent in the Puget Sound area,
compared with less than 1 percent early in the strike.
   ``It's just as effective now as it was on Nov. 4,'' Baker said.
   Binder said an average of more than 10 percent are crossing
picket lines, ranging from 5 percent in the Puget Sound area, where
union membership is mandatory, to 35 percent to 36 percent in
Wichita, where union membership is voluntary under state law.
   That compares with company figures last week of 10 percent
overall, 4 percent in the Puget Sound area and 34 percent in
Wichita.
   Even if the company figures are accurate, Baker said, ``it's not
enough to make any difference. They can't build any airplanes.''
   Spokesman Tom Cole of Boeing's Commercial Airplanes division
said one 737-300 was delivered Friday to United Airlines and
another a day earlier to Southwest Airlines, bringing total
deliveries to 19 planes since the strike began.
   Another Boeing spokesman, Jack Gamble, said another 18 or so
planes also were virtually completed before the strike and probably
could be delivered without the strikers.
   On the production line, however, work has ground to a halt.
   Baker said the strike probably would run past Saturday, the 45th
day, exceeding the length of the last Boeing walkout in 1977 and
becoming the longest work stoppage at the world's largest
commercial airplane builder since a 4{-month strike in 1948.

   Eastman Kodak Co. introduced a new
optical computer disk Monday that company officials said is capable
of storing 20 percent more information than the largest capacity
disk now on the market.
   The 14-inch optical disk will be capable of storing 8.2
gigabytes, equivalent to 8,200 megabytes, of information. Each of
the new disks will be able to hold the equivalent of 48 fully
loaded reels of magnetic tape, the company said.
   ``Our competitors _ even with their recent announcements of
increases in disk capacity _ have not been able to match the
performance or storage capacity of our first generation, 14-inch
optical disks,'' said John Batterton, a general manager of sales
and marketing in Kodak's Mass Memory Division. ``We're extending
our lead in the optical storage marketplace.''
   Kodak said the new disks would be fully compatible with hardware
components of the Kodak Optical Disk System 6800. The company said
the system's hardware will be able to write to the new disks, as
well as read from them.
   The disks are designed for use by institutions, including banks
or hospitals, to store images like X-rays or documents. Each disk
is capable of holding 2.7 million typewritten pages.

   Entertainment giant MCA Corp.'s
stock surged higher Monday on renewed takeover speculation
following reports that longtime Chairman Lew Wasserman might be
willing to consider dropping the company's resistance to a buyout.
   However, a spokesman for MCA and some analysts said a statement
by Wasserman _ who reportedly told columnist Dan Dorfman that he
would ``consider anything in the best interest of my shareholders''
_ was consistent with past MCA policy.
   Dorfman commented on the possibility Friday night on a Cable
News Network show that was repeated Monday morning.
   MCA finished up $5.62{ at $67.50 a share in active New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   The conglomerate, which has interests in film, television and
music production and distribution, amusement parks, publishing and
real estate, fiercely has resisted buyout overtures in recent years.
   The entertainment and media industry has undergone tremendous
consolidation during that time.
   In the latest major deal, Sony Corp. and Columbia Pictures
Entertainment entered a $3.4 billion takeover agreement in
September. Earlier this year, Time Inc. and Warner Communications
Inc. agreed to a $14 billion merger which would create the world's
largest media and entertainment concernm, Time Warner Inc.
   A number of industry analysts have assessed MCA stock as
undervalued, saying the company could be worth as much as it could
rise to as $80 a share.
   A secretary for Wasserman, who owns 7 percent of MCA's
outstanding shares, declined a call seeking an interview Monday and
said the 76-year-old chairman did not give interviews. President
and Chief Operating Officer Sidney Sheinberg also declined an
interview through his staff.
   Harold Haas, an MCA spokesman, said Wasserman's statement to
Dorfman was ``consistent with the policy of MCA'' regarding
takeovers.
   Analyst Steve Rosenberg of Rose Media agreed, saying the stock
surge was not big enough and Wasserman's reported statement to
Dorfman was not conclusive enough to speculate that MCA is for sale.
   ``They are a perennial takeover target and speculation after
Columbia going to Sony is rife,'' Rosenberg said. ``But I certainly
wouldn't read any tea leaves into it. ...Believe me, the stock will
move a lot more than about four points if something is really
happening.''
   Unsubstantiated reports last March indicated Sony was a possible
interested buyer for MCA.
   In 1985, MCA shareholders agreed to increase the number of
common shares by 50 percent to 150 million on the basis of reports
that RCA was moving on the company.
   The company strengthened its ``poison pill'' takeover defense in
early 1988 after New York developer Donald Trump announced he had
purchased a small stake in MCA. The plan takes effect once a raider
acquires 10 percent of MCA's outstanding shares.

<HEAD>Jacor To Buy 3 Texas Radio Stations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacor Communications Inc., which operates
radio stations and a cable television system, announced Monday it
has agreed to buy three Texas radio stations.
   The media compoany also said it had ended talks with one
potential buyer for two other radio stations. It also reported it
lost $1.8 million in the third quarter.
   Jacor announced it had entered a formal agreement with the Rusk
Corp. to buy radio stations KTRH-AM and KLOL-FM of Houston and
KSMG-FM of San Antonio, Texas, for $70.6 milion in cash. The
purchase involves assets that include the accounts receivable of
those stations, Jacor said.
   The deal is subject to approval by the Federal Communications
Commission, the company said.
   Terry S. Jacobs, Jacor's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the purchases are part of the company's continuing strategy to
buy major-market stations with growth potential.
   Meanwhile, Jacor said it has terminated negotiations for the
sale of its Jacksonville, Fla., and Knoxville, Tenn., stations with
Media Properties Inc. and is now talking with other potential
buyers.
   Jacor and Media Properties could not reach a final agreement,
the Cincinnati company said.
   Jacor owns 13 radio stations, including stations in Cincinnati,
Cleveland, Atlanta, Denver, Nashville, Knoxville, Jacksonville and
Tampa. It also owns a cable television system, as well as the
Georgia Radio News Service, Eastman Radio Inc. of New York and
Critical Mass Media Inc. in Cincinnati.
   Jacor also reported it lost $1.8 million, or 29 cents a share,
in the three months ended Sept. 30 in contrast to a profit of
$124,000 in the same period a year ago.
   Third-quarter revenue rose to $22.5 million from $22.3 million a
year earlier.
   For the first nine months, Jacor lost $12.7 million, or $1.58 a
share, in contrast to a loss of $3.4 million,or 51 cents a share, a
year ago.
   Nine-month revenue rose to $63.3 million from $56.4 million a
year ago.
   The losses were attributed to increased administrative and
interest expenses, refinancing of debt costs and growth expenses _
including the purchase of two Tampa, Fla., radio stations.

   Entertainer Merv Griffin announced
Monday he was offering Resorts International Inc. bondholders 78
percent of the casino's equity in a restructuring plan to reduce
the company's nearly $1 billion debt.
   Bondholders on Sunday filed suit in Camden to place Resorts in
involuntary bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code,
said Alison MacDonald, a New York-based spokeswoman for Resorts.
   Resorts said in a release that it had reached agreement in
principle with ``a number of substantial holders'' of its debt
about a recapitalization plan.
   As part of the agreement, bondholders said they would keep court
proceedings friendly and make the company's survival their ultimate
goal, according to Resorts officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Marc S. Kirschner, a New York attorney representing the senior
bondholders, said the agreement remains to be approved by
two-thirds of both sets of bondholders, a process he said could
take up to three months.
   Analysts disagreed on the merits of the deal, with one calling
the casino's future doubtful and another saying the restructuring
will allow the gaming hall time to rebound from a $34.9 million
third-quarter loss.
   Resorts has said it does not expect its operations to be
affected.
   Bondholders had until Wednesday to file in bankruptcy court if
they wanted to protect certain claims against Griffin.
   Wednesday is the first anniversary of Griffin's victory over
Donald Trump in a struggle for control of Resorts. Under federal
law, bondholders have one year to force Resorts into bankruptcy if
they want to claim they were defrauded when the casino changed
hands.
   The deal would leave Griffin with 22 percent of the gaming
company's equity. He would also retain the chairman's job and the
right to appoint a majority of directors.
   Under the agreement, Griffin would invest $15 million in cash
now, and another $15 million a year from Monday. He also would set
aside a $5 million fund to leave open the possibility of legal
action against Trump.
   John Barry, an attorney for Trump, was not in his office Monday
and could not be reached for comment.
   Marvin Roffman, a gaming analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott in
Philadelphia, said Griffin agreed to that portion of the deal to
avoid the prospect of a bankruptcy judge finding him liable for his
$50 million withdrawal plus a $10 million in a personal letter of
credit to Resorts.
   In August, the company suspended interest payments on $925
million in bonds and the following month announced a restructuring
plan aimed at preventing a bankruptcy filing.
   Bondholders attacked the plan and have since split into two
groups, one holding $600 million of subordinated unsecured debt and
another representing $325 million of senior secured debt.
   Those senior secured bondholders will receive $187.5 million in
new notes with a four-year term bearing interest of 6 percent in
the first year, 9 percent in the second, 12 percent in the third
and 15 percent in the final year, according to the restructuring
plan. They also will receive 2.5 percent of Resorts stock.
   Rent payments on property owned by the Showboat Hotel and Casino
will also finance $100 million in new 10-year bonds to those
bondholders.
   Junior bondholders will swap their debt for 75.5 percent of the
company's equity and $113.5 in new bonds.
   Roffman said the senior bondholders ``have a much better chance
of coming out smelling like a rose,'' because Resorts' debt will be
reduced by more than $600 million as a result of junior bondholders
exchanging their debt for 75 percent of the company's shares.
   ``What's 75 percent of nothing, though?'' Roffman asked,
questioning the long-term viability of Resorts, which faces the
opening next door of Trump's massive Taj Mahal casino in the spring
as well as the prospects of a declining economy.
   Resorts also needs millions of dollars worth of renovation,
which casino officials attributed as a factor in the third-quarter
financial results.
   Casino analyst John Uphoff, of Raymond James &amp; Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla., said Griffin made key concessions which could
save Resorts.
   ``In the long-term, the Taj could create more activity at that
end of the Boardwalk,'' Uphoff said. ``There'll be 4,000 people
there each night and they'll be wandering one way to the Showboat
and one way to Resorts.''
   Many analysts think Griffin paid an exorbitant price for
Resorts, the oldest casino on the Boardwalk. Trump ended up with
the unfinished Taj Mahal mega-casino for $230 million, less than
half the $500 million Resorts poured into its construction.

   Detroit Free Press Executive Editor Heath
Meriwether walked out into his newsroom Monday and saw a sea of
smiling faces.
   Meriwether told the 70 or so employees what they already knew,
but were waiting to hear from him: The U.S. Supreme Court, by a 4-4
tie, had cleared the way for the Free Press and The Detroit News to
partially merge their operations.
   ``Whoever said a tie was like kissing your sister didn't have it
quite right,'' Meriwether said.
   Since 1986, Knight-Ridder Inc., owner of the Free Press, and
Gannett Co. Inc., owner of the News, had been seeking to merge
their business, circulation and advertising departments. Editorial
departments would remain separate.
   ``We're joined at the wallet but not at the heart,'' said Joe
Swickard, a Free Press court reporter.
   The joint operating agreement, or JOA, will begin on Nov. 27,
and the first joint issue will come out Dec. 2, said William
Keating, president of the Detroit Newspaper Agency, which will
handle the newspapers' combined operations. The newspaper will
publish joint issues on Saturdays and Sundays.
   ``This guarantees that there will be two editorial voices in the
Detroit community for a long time _ 100 years, according to the
terms of the contract,'' Keating said.
   The tie vote by the nation's highest court meant that earlier
court decisions upholding the joint operating agreement would
stand. Justice Byron R. White had excused himself from the case for
undisclosed personal reasons.
   The Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, an organization
which challenged the arrangement, will not ask the court for a
rehearing, said group Vice President Matt Beer.
   However, Beer said, giving up the Detroit fight didn't mean the
door was open for other newspapers to form such mergers. ``We've
created enough thin ice that anyone else who applies for a JOA will
do so carefully,'' he said.
   Another opponent, the Public Citizen Litigation Group, may seek
a rehearing, organization attorney William Schultz said in
Washington. Such a rehearing is seldom granted, Schultz
acknowledged.
   He and Beer noted that the court's decision came without an
opinion, so no one knows the justices' thinking behind their vote.
   Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley said he was disappointed
that the court didn't issue an opinion. He said his office was
considering asking for a rehearing.
   The JOA request, brought under the Newspaper Preservation Act of
1970, said the Free Press would fail without the deal.
Knight-Ridder had said if the plan were not adopted, it would close
the 158-year-old Detroit newspaper.
   Louis Mleczko, president of Local 22 of The Newspaper Guild,
said he was disappointed with the decision. The Guild was the last
of the newspapers' unions to drop opposition to the arrangement.
   ``No more separate papers on weekends, no more morning Detroit
Newses, nor more Sunday Free Presses they've known it in the past,
no more Detroit News as they've known it in the past,'' he said.
``Advertisers are going to see skyrocketing advertising rates after
a short period of time.''
   Some Free Press employees expressed relief and joy, as well as
concern for about 500 workers who will lose their jobs when the JOA
takes effect. The Free Press has 2,200 employees, and the News
about 2,300.
   Officials with some suburban newspapers said the partial merger
would be bad news for them, too. Joining the two Detroit papers
advertising departments could present smaller papers with a huge,
near-monopoly on newspaper advertising, forcing them to boost
advertising rates, opponents have said.
   ``What it means is that like all news publishers in southeast
Michigan, we will be busy reprinting our (advertising) rate
cards,'' said Ed Wendover, publisher and editor of The Community
Crier, a weekly paper serving Plymouth and Canton, 25 miles west of
Detroit.

<HEAD>European Finance Ministers Consider British Plan for Monetary Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European finance ministers on Monday
listened sympathetically to Britain's alternative approach for
closer European monetary ties but did not wholeheartedly endorse
it, according to a British official.
   John Major, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, told a news
conference that the plan would be discussed next month at a summit
in Strasbourg, France, of the leaders of the 12-nation European
Community.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the British paper was taken
very seriously ... by the delegations,'' he said.
   He acknowledged that ``it wasn't universally applauded. There
were mixed views about it. But it had a good deal of support.''
   Major, attending his first EC meeting as Britain's top treasury
official, replaced Nigel Lawson, who quit last month in a policy
dispute with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Lawson's resignation
rocked the British government.
   Other European finance officials have expressed concern that the
British approach could slow the movement toward full economic and
monetary union of the dozen nations of the trading bloc, also
called the Common Market.
   Earlier this month, the British government unveiled what it
described as its ``market-based'' approach to the development of
closer monetary ties. It calls for removing restrictions so that
all the European currencies would be legal tender _ acceptable for
savings and transactions _ throughout the community.
   The British have offered their plan as an alternative to
sweeping proposals that would lead to a common currency and central
bank system. The recommendations were laid out in a report drawn up
last spring by a panel of European central bankers. The committee
was led by Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
the community's executive body.
   The Delors plan sets out three stages for implementing monetary
union. Leaders of the EC nations agreed at a summit last June in
Madrid to go ahead with the first stage, generally calling for
closer economic and monetary ties.
   At Monday's meeting, the finance ministers gave a green light to
proposals setting the framework for closer consultations among the
nations on economic and monetary matters. That framework would be
part of the first phase of the monetary plan, which is scheduled to
begin July 1.
   As part the first phase, all currencies would be linked in the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which
keeps their values roughly steady within certain bands. The
currencies of Britain, Greece and Portugal remain outside the
linkage.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who has long resisted entering the pound into the
system, agreed at the Madrid summit to do so but only under certain
conditions. She gave no timetable.
   Major reiterated Britain's objections to the later stages of the
Delors report. ``I made it clear ... that the United Kingdom has
very considerable worries about stages two and three,'' he said.
   Mrs. Thatcher has argued that the radical moves to a joint
currency and central bank system would force nations to give up
some of their sovereignty to new institutions.
   The move toward monetary union would enlarge on the community's
push to create a single market in late 1992 by lifting the barriers
that bar the free movement of people, money, goods and services.

<HEAD>Condor Partners Launches Effort To Remove UAL Board</HEAD>

   The investment group Condor Partners took a step
Monday toward wresting control of UAL Corp. from its board of
directors, which in turn authorized its financial adviser to
explore alternatives to a takeover of the parent of United Airlines.
   Condor, formed as a takeover vehicle by the New York investment
group Coniston Partners, gained access to a list of UAL
stockholders Monday by submitting certain documents to the company.
This enables the group to send consent solicitation materials to
the stockholders, seeking their approval for removing certain board
members.
   The documents ``did not disclose the terms or financing of any
proposals that Coniston might contemplate,'' the board said in a
statement after it met Monday.
   The board said it has authorized its financial adviser, First
Boston Corp., ``to explore potential transactions with third
parties, including actively determining available alternative
transactions'' such as employee ownership or recapitalization.
   The board said it has not received any offers from third parties.
   Coniston announced Nov. 3 that it owned 9.7 percent of UAL and
wanted to direct a sale, recapitalization or other ``extraordinary
transaction'' involving the Chicago-based company.
   Coniston also wants to reduce UAL's board from 16 members to
five, three of whom would be Coniston principals.
   The board said Monday that the two directors Coniston wants to
retain, Stephen Wolf and Frank Olson, have indicated they would not
serve on any UAL board controlled by Coniston. Wolf is UAL's
chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   Monday's board meeting was the first since directors freed Wolf
to explore new options following a collapsed employee effort to buy
the company.
   UAL's shares closed Monday at $193.25, up $3.75 in consolidated
New York Stock exchange trading.
   Samuel Buttrick, an airline analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. in
New York, said that given the failure of the $6.75 billion buyout
bid by United's pilots, a management team and British Airways PLC,
there are significant numbers of UAL shareholders who are
sympathetic toward Coniston.
   Speculators want to see UAL sold or recapitalized quickly to
minimize their losses following the Oct. 13 collapse of the
$300-a-share bid from the pilot-management group.
   ``If I were on the board, I would assume that there are
sufficient shares held by accounts sympathetic to Coniston that
would result in a majority vote against the board,'' Buttrick said.
   Analysts said UAL began its defense against Coniston's attempt
to seize control of its board when it gave Wolf permission to seek
a buyout or recapitalization.
   ``It would seem that one obvious alternative (to Coniston) is
for Wolf to put together a management-labor team to buy out the
company,'' said analyst Louis Marckesano of Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. in Philadelphia.
   ``Failing that, he could put together a restructuring similar to
what happened with Allegis.''
   Allegis Corp., the former parent of United, was broken up in
1987 after Coniston obtained a 14 percent stake in the company and
demanded an end to its diversification within the travel industry.
   In response to the pressure, Allegis sold its Westin and Hilton
International hotel operations and its Hertz car rental business.
   Marckesano said there are difficulties associated with a
recapitalization because UAL has few assets to sell to raise cash.
   He noted that UAL has cash on hand, and could sell its aircraft
and lease them back.
   ``The best alternative is a management-labor buyout,''
Marckesano said.
   Officials of the Air Line Pilots Association chapter at United
met last week with Coniston principals and financier Saul
Steinberg, a friend of Wolf who is seeking government permission to
buy more than 15 percent of UAL.
   Pilots said they have discussed a revised bid with UAL
management, but they hinted last week that they might resume a work
slowdown in effect earlier this year unless the UAL board recommits
in the next two weeks to majority employee ownership.
   United's Machinists, who opposed the failed buyout bid, also met
last week with Coniston principals.
   They say they won't support any highly leveraged deal that could
threaten the airline's viability or that would involve Wolf.

   A California options broker was barred
permanently from membership in the Chicago Board Options Exchange
for trading on a customer's account without permission and refusing
to cooperate in the investigation, the exchange said Monday as it
announced five disciplinary actions.
   According to the CBOE, Paul Weirather, a former registered
representative in the Modesto, Calif., branch of Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., consented to a ban on membership and from
associating with any exchange member.
   Weirather was accused of making ``numerous transactions ...
without prior written authorization from the customer and prior
written approval by the firm.''
   The exchange said he also refused to respond to requests for
information on the transactions. Weirather and the four other
people disciplined neither admitted nor denied the allegations
brought by the exchange, and all consented to the punishment.
   Also disciplined was Jonathon E. Gross, a former registered
representative of Oppenheimer and Co., who allegedly made
misrepresentations to a public customer. He was censured and
suspended for six months from associating with other members.
   Richard V. Seffren, a former exchange market maker, was accused
of a transaction that failed to contribute to the maintenance of a
fair and orderly market. He was censured and suspended for three
days.
   Mark C. Williamson, a former registered representative in the
Burlington, Mass., branch of Dean Witter Reynolds, was censured and
suspended from association with other exchange members for two
weeks. He was accused of making trades on a customer's account
without permission.
   Charles D. Tom, a former registered representative in the
Chicago office of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., allegedly guaranteed
a customer's account against losses in return for sharing in the
profits. He was censured and suspended from associating with other
members for five days.

<HEAD>Nintendo Wins Ruling on Soviet-Made Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The home video rights to a Soviet-designed
video game called Tetris belong to Nintendo rather than rival Atari
Games Corp., a federal judge said Monday.
   U.S. District Judge Fern Smith cancelled a scheduled trial and
said she would rule that Nintendo owned the rights to the game. In
June, she halted sales of Tetris by an Atari Games subsidiary,
Tengen Inc., which had started marketing the game in May.
   ``We expect Tetris to be one of our top-selling titles for the
holidays,'' said Richard Lindner, a spokesman for Nintendo. The
Japanese company is marketing the game for both home video systems
and hand-held video machines.
   Morgan Chu, a lawyer for Atari Games and Tengen, said the ruling
would be appealed. He noted that the ruling does not prevent Atari
Games from continuing to produce Tetris for coin-operated video
games and personal computers.
   Nintendo also is seeking damages for profits Tengen made from
its home video sales of the game. Smith urged the companies to try
to resolve that issue and others in the case.
   The dispute is an offshoot of a $100 million suit filed last
December by Atari Games against Nintendo, whose U.S. subsidiary
controls 80 percent of the U.S. market for home video game machines.
   Atari Games contends Nintendo is violating antitrust laws by
limiting the number of games it makes under licensing agreements
with software developers and using a ``lock-out'' computer chip
that prevents the software writers from independently making games
that are compatible with the Nintendo system.
   Nintendo says Atari Games is violating Nintendo's patent by
making games that can be played on Nintendo machines. Atari Games,
based in Milpitas, is unrelated to computer-maker Atari Inc.
   Players in Tetris, developed by Soviet programmers, manipulate
geometric shapes to form prescribed patterns.
   Nintendo said it negotiated the home video rights to the game
from the Soviet foreign trade agency ELORG. That agency previously
granted certain rights to the game to a British firm that was the
source of Tengen's license.
   But Nintendo said ELORG had intended the British license to
apply only to personal computers and not to home video games.
Nintendo said the Soviets were surprised and angry to learn that
Tengen claimed an exclusive license for home video production.
Nintendo submitted statements from the Soviet developers of the
game to Smith.

   Meredith Corp., the publisher of Better
Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal, announced Monday it has
purchased Golf For Women magazine from Brumitt Publishing of
Oxford, Miss.
   Terms were not disclosed.
   Of Meredith's 12 other subscription magazines, the only other
sports-related publication is Sail.
   ``The game of golf is exploding in popularity, but women golfers
have been among the most neglected sports people in the nation,''
said Jim Autry, president of the magazine group of the publishing,
broadcasting and real estate company. ``As nearly half of all
beginning golfers are women, we're excited by the opportunities
this market represents.''
   Meredith said the magazine's editorial headquarters would remain
in Mississippi under the direction of founders Debra and Woody
Brumitt.
   Effective with the April 1990 issue, which goes on sale in
mid-February, Golf For Women will have a circulation of 200,000,
including newsstand and subscription sales, Meredith said.
   The magazine comes out six times a year with a cover price of
$2.50 and an annual subscription rate of $14.97.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whitman Corp.'s board of directors announced
Monday it had elected Amoco Corp. Vice Chairman James W. Cozad as
chairman and chief executive officer of the Chicago-based
conglomerate, effective Jan. 1.
   Cozad, 62, who also is chief financial officer of Chicago-based
Amoco, will succeed Karl D. Bays at Whitman, who died of a heart
attack last week.
   Until Cozad takes office, the company will be led by Miles L.
Marsh, its president and chief operating officer.
   Cozad joined Amoco in 1969 as financial vice president. He
became a vice president of Amoco in 1971, a director in 1976 and
was elected vice chairman in 1983.
   ``Jim Cozad has made a major contribution to Amoco's success,''
said Amoco Chairman Richard Morrow. ``While I regret his leaving
Amoco, I certainly understand his decision to accept the position
at Whitman, where he has been a director for several years.''
   Morrow said Cozad will be succeeded by Frederick S. Addy as
Amoco's chief financial officer. Addy, 57, is vice president of
finance.
   There had been speculation that Marsh would be named Bays'
replacement. Marsh, 42, previously headed General Foods Corp., a
subsidiary of Philip Morris Cos. Inc. He arrived at Whitman nine
weeks ago.
   Whitman's operations include Pet Inc. foods, Pepsi-Cola General
Bottlers, Hussman Corp. food service equipment, and Midas
International Corp. auto service centers.
   Shortly before his death last week, Bays told a meeting of
bankers and investors in London of his outline for a strategy of
pumping funds into Whitman's operations to increase production
capacity and improve profitability.
   Acquisitions will play an important role in Whitman's expansion,
he said.
   Analysts say Bays' strategy likely will be followed by his
successor.
   Since selling the Illinois Central Railroad and shedding its
defense, aerospace and heavy manufacturing units, the former IC
Industries _ renamed for the candies Pet Food produces _ has
concentrated on consumer goods and services.

<HEAD>Westwood One Sells Half-Interest In New York's WNEW</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westwood One signed a letter of
intent Monday to sell its 50 percent interest in New York's WNEW-AM
radio station for $15.3 million cash to Command Communications.
   The deal came just six months after Westwood One bought the
interest for $11 million.
   Westwood One also announced Monday a three-way deal involving
itself, Group W and Command Communications in which Westwood One
will purchase KJQY-FM in San Diego.
   Terms of that transaction call for Westwood One to pay $15
million in cash to Group W and $4 million worth of Westwood One
common stock priced at $10.75 a share, or 372,093 shares, to
Command Communications, to be held for a period of three years.
   Command Communications will in turn transfer to Westwood One the
option it recently acquired for KJQY from Group W.
   Under terms of the WNEW deal, Command has agreed to continue its
affiliation agreements with the NBC and Mutual Radio networks, both
of which are owned by Westwood One, and will continue to broadcast
for at least the next two years such Westwood One-produced talk
shows as ``The Larry King Show'' and ``The Bruce Williams Show.''
   Westwood One owns the NBC Radio Networks, the Mutual
Broadcasting System and the trade publication Radio &amp; Records, and
also owns and operates radio stations WYNY-FM in New York and KQLZ
``Pirate Radio'' in Los Angeles.
   The transactions are subject to approval by the Federal
Communications Commission and other regulatory agencies.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Share Prices Fall</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning Nikkei, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was slightly higher against the
Japanese yen Tuesday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange erased earlier gains and inched down.
   The dollar ended the morning session at 143.73 yen, slightly
lower from its opening. The currency started trading at 143.80 yen,
up 0.25 yen from Monday's close here of 143.55 yen, and ranged from
143.60 to 143.83 yen during morning trading.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 19.01
points, or 0.05 percent, to end the morning session at 35,731.11.
It closed at a record 35,750.12, up 86.92 points, on Monday.
   The index fell as participants expressed fear that stock prices
had gone too high, said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a dealer with Daiwa
Securities.
   ``The trading was just directionless,'' he said, adding that
uncertainties over foreign exchange rates also discouraged stock
buying.
   Institutional investors were reluctant to make major moves prior
to the auction of 30-year U.S. government bonds scheduled for later
Tuesday in Washington, other dealers said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate was moving narrowly,
as market players were reluctant to make major moves ahead of a
series of releases of the U.S. economic indicators later this week,
as well as the auction for the U.S. government bonds, said a
foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   Among the major releases was the U.S. retail price index for
October, due out later Tuesday.
   The analyst, speaking anonymously, said the West German mark,
which had been bought earlier, was lower due to sellings for
profit-taking.

<HEAD>NYNEX and Unions Settle Health Issue; Tentative Deal Could Be Near</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to UPDATE with union stopped studying proposal,
will resume talks Tuesday morning; picks up 4th graf, `Union and ...'.

   NYNEX Corp. said it had reached a tentative
agreement Monday with its two unions to end a bitter 100-day strike
after agreeing to pay health care costs, but a union leader said
its leaders hadn't granted approval.
   An agreement would end the last of a series of walkouts that hit
regional phone companies last summer.
   A spokesman for one of the unions, the Communications Workers of
America, said they would resume discussions on the proposal Tuesday
morning. Union heads recessed talks late Monday.
   Union and company spokesmen said, however, that striking
telephone employees could return to work as early as next Monday.
   ``We have saved our health care. There are no premiums,'' CWA
President Morton Bahr told the AFL-CIO convention Monday in
Washington.
   NYNEX officials said the company only agreed to pay the health
benefits after eliminating its offers of a partial lump sum payment
of wage increases and profit sharing.
   NYNEX Chairman William C. Ferguson said in a statement the
health benefits arrangement was ``a realistic solution to a very
difficult set of issues facing not only the company but the entire
nation.''
   NYNEX, through its subsidiaries New York Telephone and New
England Telephone, provides phone service in most of the Northeast.
   CWA, representing 40,000 NYNEX workers, and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which bargains for an additional
20,000 employees, struck the company Aug. 6, resisting its attempt
to shift health insurance costs to workers.
   ``There's an awful lot of light at the end of the tunnel,'' said
Steve Rosenthal, a CWA spokesman in New York. ``The health issue
has been resolved and that was the largest issue.''
   Rosenthal said a tentative agreement would be reached if a
committee of key union representatives meeting in Rye north of New
York City decided it liked the offer. Minor issues would still need
to be worked out and the agreement would have to be put to a
membership vote.
   One IBEW member, Stephen St. Peter, said in Boston that the
contract, in addition to fully company-paid health benefits,
provides for a 3 percent salary hike in the first year and 1{
percent raises in the second and third years in addition to a
cost-of-living increase of 2{ percent to 5 percent.
   Bahr said he had returned to Washington Monday morning from a
negotiating session that began Sunday morning and had concluded
with the agreement on the company-wide framework.
   Still to be resolved are local issues such as specific job
titles and work rules at the NYNEX subsidiaries.
   ``The single issue was a fight to protect health care benefits
that were negotiated, fought for, struck for over 25 years of
collective bargaining,'' Bahr said.
   He said he was proud the unions had fought back the attempt to
shift health care costs but said neither side could claim a victory.
   ``Both sides paid a very heavy penalty for miscalculations by
management,'' Bahr said. ``They have undoubtedly lost business to
non-union competitors, which will have an adverse impact on us, and
our members are in the 15th week of a strike to protect what they
had.''
   Strikes that began Aug. 6 affected three other regional phone
companies around the country: Ameritech in the Midwest, Pacific
Telesis in the West and Bell Atlantic in the West. All were settled
by the end of August.

   Creditors of Yugo America Inc. have until
Dec. 6 to vote on a final reorganization plan for the Upper Saddle
River-based company, according to a lawyer for the U.S. agents of
the Yugoslav car manufacturer.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Vincent J. Commisa approved Yugo America's
disclosure statement last Thursday, said Robert A. Baime, a lawyer
for Impex Car Corp.
   Baime said the disclosure statement, along with the
reorganization plan, would be distributed to Yugo America's secured
and unsecured creditors, who have until Dec. 6 to vote on whether
to accept the plan.
   The disclosure statement serves as a prospectus of the
reorganziation plan, Baime said, and is designed to give creditors
information about the plan.
   The plan would provide for a 21-cent per dollar payment to
unsecured creditors over three years or nine cents on the dollar if
they elect not to wait three years, Baime said.
   Dealers who continued to serve as Yugo dealers would receive 100
percent payment under the plan, Baime said. Dealers who elected to
stop selling Yugos or were dropped by the company would be treated
as unsecured creditors.
   Manufacturers Hanover Trust, the main secured creditor, would be
paid in full, Baime said.
   Under the reorganization, Zavodni Crevna Zastava, the car's
manufacturer, would become the wholly owned parent company, Baime
said.
   Commisa set the next hearing in the case for Dec. 13, Baime said.

to ADD Bush asking record of congressional inquiries. Also moving on general
news wires.</HEAD>

   The nation's top thrift regulator said Monday
he has no intention of resigning despite President Bush's assertion
that he is ``not closing the door'' on replacing him.
   ``The president has indicated that he, too, wants to hear the
other side of the story,'' M. Danny Wall, head of the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervison, told reporters. ``The
other side needs to be heard from in a timely way.''
   Wall has been the target of hearings by the House Banking
Committee into why he waited two years to seize Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association after government S&amp;L examiners concluded that the
Irvine, Calif., thrift was being operated unsoundly.
   But while the panel's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
has directed his fire against Wall, the shrapnel has hit five
senators who intervened on Lincoln's behalf with Wall's predecessor
in early 1987 after receiving a total of $1.3 million in political
gifts raised by Lincoln's owner.
   Wall said Monday that two of those senators also had contacted
him about Lincoln after he took over as head of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, the predecessor of the Treasury Department agency,
in July 1987.
   All five senators _ Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain,
R-Ariz.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and
John Glenn, D-Ohio _ are now the focus of inquires by the Senate
Ethics Committee and the FBI into their ties with Phoenix
millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of Lincoln's parent
company.
   Government sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
Monday the FBI has interviewed Edwin J. Gray, who was Wall's
predecessor as the bank's board chairman until July 1987, and
Gray's assistant, Shannon Fairbanks, about an April 2, 1987 meeting
with all of the senators but Riegle.
   Both testified at a hearing last week that DeConcini _ who
received $48,000 in campaign gifts from Keating, a Phoenix
millionaire, and his associates _ asked him at the meeting to
withdraw a regulation that would have curtailed Lincoln's risky
investments.
   DeConcini has denied making the request and the three other
senators present either denied hearing it or said they cannot
recall it being made.
   Wall said Monday that Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, and Gonzalez asked him in a joint letter shortly after
President Bush signed a $157 million S&amp;L bailout bill in August to
keep a record of congressional inquries about specific enforcement
actions.
   A system for doing that has not been completed yet, Wall said.
   Wall said he has been questioned by the FBI in criminal
investigations into several thrifts, but not about any contacts
with the five senators.
   Bush, acknowledging that concerns about the relationship between
Lincoln and its regulators has reached the White House, has said he
intends to respond ``fairly soon'' to a written request by Gonzalez
three weeks ago to replace Wall.
   ``I'm not closing the door on it; I just don't know at this
juncture,'' Bush said. ``But when the question is put: If part of
the savings and loan problem proves to be me management or
regulation people that aren't aggressive enough, would you make
changes?, the answer is yes.''
   Wall, a former banking aide to Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, on Monday
interpreted Bush's remark as only an indication that he wants to
hear both sides before making any judgment.
   He said no one at the White House has talked with him about the
House banking or Senate ethics committee probes and repeated his
complaint that, after four weeks of hearings, he has still not
testified.
   Wall's tentatively scheduled appearances before the committee
have been postponed twice by Gonzalez. He is now scheduled to
testify on Nov. 21, the same day that Keating has been subpoenaed
to appear.
   ``The president is a lawyer by training, and clearly he know
that one is innocent until proven guilty,'' Wall said. ``And
certainly one has to have an opportunity to respond to the
questions that are raised.''
   In fact, Bush is not a lawyer.
   Gonzalez, meanwhile, said Monday he hopes Bush ``really
considers removing'' Wall. ``It's a shame that Wall didn't remove
himself on his own initiative,'' he added.
   Answering reporters' questions, Wall said Cranston, called him
in August or September of 1987 asking why a year-long examination
of Lincoln by Bank Board regulators in San Franciso had not been
completed. Keating interests gave Cranston or projects in which he
was interested $974,000.
   Wall said he also received a phone call from Cranston and two
from DeConcini earlier this year urging prompt Bank Board
consideration of three different offers by private investors to buy
the troubled thrift before it was seized by the government in April.
   None of the offers was acceptable to the bank board, Wall said.
But he added that he considered all of the calls from the senators
``appropriate.''
