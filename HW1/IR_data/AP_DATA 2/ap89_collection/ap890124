<HEAD>Judge Rules MacDonald Can Keep Just $50,000 of `Fatal Vision' Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Army doctor Jeffrey MacDonald,
convicted of killing his wife and daughters, may keep just $50,000
of the $325,000 settlement he won in a dispute over a book about the
killings, a judge ruled Tuesday.
   Superior Court Judge Edward Ross deducted $92,000 from the
remaining $275,000 to cover attorneys' fees stemming from
MacDonald's lawsuit against ``Fatal Vision'' author Joe McGinniss.
   The rest of the money will be placed in a trust, with the
beneficiaries to be determined later, the judge said.
   Attorneys for MacDonald's mother-in-law, Mildred Kassab, had
argued that state law bars a convicted criminal from profiting from
his crime, and, therefore, MacDonald should not be able to keep the
funds.
   Mrs. Kassab said earlier she wanted the money to go toward a
memorial or charity in honor of her dead daughter and granddaughters.
   MacDonald had sued McGinniss, claiming the author lied to gain
his confidence to write a book, which concluded the former Green
Beret doctor killed his wife and their daughters, ages 2 and 5, at
their Fort Bragg, N.C., apartment in 1970.
   MacDonald, who had contended the slayings were the work of
drugged hippies, was convicted in 1979 and is serving three life
sentences.
   ``I'll hold that MacDonald had a viable claim against
McGinniss,'' Ross said. But the judge said MacDonald's argument that
he needed the money to care for needy relatives, pay future legal
fees and fund an investigation into the slayings did not entitle him
to the full settlement.
   However, he said it would be impossible to recoup an estimated
$90,000 received earlier and spent by MacDonald through the book
contract.

   Operators at a South Carolina nuclear weapons
plant made mistakes during a routine pressure test last weekend and
caused more damage to valves and pipes in the plant, according to
the Washington Post.
   The accident damaged a backup cooling system for the K reaator,
one of three reactors closed since April because of safety problems
at the Savannah River, S.C., plant, the newspaper report in its
Wednesday editions.
   The incident didn't pose any public health or safety dangers, the
newspaper quoted unnamed Energy Department officials as saying, but
it did raise new questions about operating procedures at the aging
plant.
   Earlier, government officials said more study will be needed to
determine the severity of numerous cracks in the cooling systems at
Savannan River.
   Department of Energy officials told an advisory panel they needed
more time to assess cracking problems at the Savannah River Plant,
the nation's only source of tritium, a perishable and increasingly
scarce gas vital to making nuclear warheads.
   The three-reactor complex has not been producing tritium since
last April, when the Energy Department shut down the last active
reactor for safety reasons.
   E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., the operator of the reactors,
disclosed earlier this month it had discovered and was monitoring 27
cooling system cracks, including 15 in the reactor it hopes to
restart by the end of this year.
   John Ahearne, chairman of the Energy Department's advisory
committee on nuclear facility safety, said the panel was told by
Richard W. Starostecki, a department safety official, the cracking
problem was ``probably not as serious as has been suggested, but
it's still an open question.''
   Ahearne said the department planned to continue assessing the
severity of the problem.
   If the cracked pipes need to be replaced, the work could cause
further delays in restarting the reactors.
   The department said earlier this month it hoped to resume tritium
production at Savannah River by late this year, although it gave no
firm target date.
   Starostecki also reaffirmed to the panel that a phased restart of
plutonium processing at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility
near Denver, Colo., had begun late last week.
   The plant, which reprocesses plutonium from old warheads for use
in new ones, was shut down by federal authorities last October
following an incident in which three employees were accidentally
exposed to plutonium particles.
   Starostecki said the processing plant could be back in full
operation as soon as late March.
   Energy Department officials also outlined the findings of a
report based on a lengthy inspection of safety procedures at Rocky
Flats last November and December.
   The officials said the report, which has not yet been made
public, is highly critical of the labor practices of Rockwell
International, the operator of the Rocky Flats complex.
   Starostecki and other department officials said a practice of
permitting workers to shift job assignments without proper
preparation had led to poor performance of duties and inadequate
attention to safety problems and procedures.
   The officials said they also found inadequate training of workers
who monitor radiation within the plant, as well as flaws in the fire
protection system.
   They added, however, that Rockwell in recent months had shown a
genuine willingness to change its procedures and adopt a long-term
strategy for improving safety.

   The White House is considering a program to
force customers of banks and of savings and loans institutions to
pay a large part of the multi-billion-dollar cost of rescuing the
S&amp;L industry, the Washington Post reported.
   Treasury Department officials tried last week to win support from
Congress for a proposal to tax depositors who put money in federally
insured institutions, the Post said in its Wednesday editions, even
as President Bush was promising he wouldn't raise taxes.
   According to the paper, Treasury officials met secretly with
leaders of the House Banking Committee last week and Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady met with Senate Republican leaders on
Tuesday to discuss the proposal. It would impose a tax of as much as
30 cents for every $100 deposited at a federally insured
institution, according to the Post's unnamed sources.
   The newspaper quoted Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L.
William Seidman as saying, ``It's the reverse toaster theory.
Instead of the bank giving you a toaster when you make a deposit,
you give them one.''
   Earlier, the S&amp;L industry's largest trade group on Tuesday
recommended tapping the U.S. Treasury to close insolvent
institutions while slashing the amount contributed by healthy S&amp;Ls.
   The proposal by the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, if
adopted, would have the effect of shifting all of the burden for
solving the problems of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
onto taxpayers and freeing the industry from further responsibility.
   The group, which plans to present its proposal Thursday at a
hearing of the House Budget Committee, wants to create a Resolution
Corporation as a new, independent federal agency.
   The Resolution Corporation would be responsible for liquidating
or selling the more than 350 insolvent, but still open, S&amp;Ls as well
as any institutions that lapse into insolvency in the next three
years.
   It also would take over all of the obligations the FSLIC has
acquired in rescuing institutions in the past. For instance, the
FSLIC ``resolved'' the cases of 205 insolvent institutions last
year, largely by issuing promissory notes and guarantees against
loss. These obligations would be transferred to the Resolution
Corporation.
   The Resolution Corporation would raise money by issuing notes,
which would be guaranteed by the Treasury. Any money the Resolution
Corporation gets from selling failed S&amp;Ls to new investors or from
selling the assets would go toward paying off the notes. However,
the Treasury would have to pay most of the bill.
   In the meantime, a new, industry-funded FSLIC would be created to
insure the deposits of healthy S&amp;Ls, which would pay an insurance
premium no higher than the premiums paid by commercial banks to
their fund, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Banks currently pay 8 cents per $100 in deposits. Since 1985,
S&amp;Ls have been paying a higher fee, 21 cents per $100 in deposits.
   Barney R. Beeksma, chairman of the U.S. League, argued that S&amp;Ls
already have paid $5 billion in extra assessments and can't afford
to pay more if they are to build their capital, a key reform
advocated by the League and private analysts.
   Capital represents the amount of money put up by an institution's
owners as backing for public deposits. The more capital there is,
the greater the cushion against failure and the more incentive the
owners have to operate the S&amp;L safely.
   ``We've paid all that we can pay and what we're concerned with
now is creating a viable insurance fund for the future,'' Beeksma
said in a telephone interview. ``Somebody has to decide whether they
want us to pay the bill for the FSLIC or build our capital to make
sure this doesn't happen again. We can't do both.''
   He said tapping taxpayer's funds ``is a price for the mistakes
that were made in the past by the Congress, the regulators and the
few in our business that shouldn't have been let in.''
   The trade group also is recommending that both the Resolution
Corporation and the new FSLIC should be independent of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, the regulator of the nation's 3,000 federally
insured S&amp;Ls. It said the current system of consolidated S&amp;L
regulation has not provided the necessary checks and balances.
   The league rejected, for now, proposals to merge the insurance
funds for S&amp;Ls and commercial banks. Beeksma said the issue should
be ``re-visited'' by Congress in three years, ``after the furor
subsides.''
   Meanwhile, the Treasury Department is finishing its own
recommendations to President Bush. It hasn't disclosed the plan, but
it has said a key principal of its recommendation will be that
further industry resources and additional insurance premiums should
be tapped before public funds.
   Bush, in a meeting Tuesday with congressional leaders, said he
would propose substantial revisions next month to Ronald Reagan's
budget, including measures to deal with the savings and loan crisis.
   In another development, Rep. Bob Michel of Illinois, the House
Republican leader, announced the creation of a GOP task force to
recommend solutions to the S&amp;L crisis. It will be chaired by Rep.
Stan Parris, R-Va., a member of the House Banking Committee.

   The Indiana shoreline of Lake Michigan is home to
the nation's steel giants. And perhaps no Rust Belt city better
typifies a steel town than Gary. The steel slump of the '80s hit
hard in Gary, already struggling with crime, decay and a declining
tax base. But steel is making a comeback and Gary hopes it can, too.
The third story of a four-part series, ``The Changing Heartland,''
looks at the resurgence in Gary and northwestern Indiana.

<TEXT>
   This steel town has long been a four-letter
word for all that's gone wrong in industrial America: a shrinking
workforce, sooty skies, a sorry future.
   With the city's fate tied to steel's fortunes, when the industry
hurts, so does Gary. Now that steel is surging, this archetypal Rust
Belt city says it is on the mend, too.
   Unemployment is down, companies are moving in, real estate is
being snatched up. More importantly, Gary is looking beyond steel _
a lakefront marina is planned and an airport project is being pushed.
   ``We're on an upturn now,'' said Mayor Thomas Barnes. ``The
optimism we feel is not because we've resolved the problems that
exist. It's because we're right now on a track to resolving them.
There's growth as opposed to further decline. People are taking
another look at Gary.''
   They will still find a depressed city _ shuttered stores, gutted
homes and a bleak downtown with no hotel or department store. But
there also is new prosperity due, in part, to a leaner, profitable
steel industry that's been boosted by increasing demand, import
limits, the low dollar and new technology.
   After losses of almost $12 billion in 1982-86, the industry
nationwide earned $1 billion in 1987 and is expected to double that
for 1988.
   That improvement has contributed to an upturn in Gary and other
parts of northwestern Indiana, site of the world's greatest
concentration of steel-making capacity. For example:
   _ Five steel companies in Porter and Lake counties, the latter
including Gary, have spent more than $2.5 billion on their
facilities since 1982, said the Indiana Steel Advisory Commission.
   Indiana is America's No. 1 steel producer; 22 percent of the
nation's steel is made there. The industry pumps almost $20 million
daily into Indiana's economy.
   _ Unemployment in the Gary-Hammond, Ind., area fell from 15.7
percent in 1982-83 to 9.5 percent in 1987; the 1987 numbers would
have been lower but for a six-month walkout at USS Gary Works, the
city's biggest employer and flagship of USX Corp.
   November's unemployment rate was 6.1 percent; 1988 was the first
year this decade without double-digit employment in any month. Those
figures, however, do not reflect huge population losses. The area's
labor force shrunk by 38,100 from 1980 to November 1988.
   _ New and expanding businesses in the Gary area have filled 12.4
million square feet of industrial space and created almost 6,500
jobs since 1984. Much of the growth is steel-related.
   Gary ``is one of the best heavy industrial locations in
America,'' said John Gates, an investor and redeveloper. ``You're
close to all the major manufacturers in the United States. Most of
these peoples' customers are nearby. You've got very inexpensive
rents and real estate costs.
   ``If someone needs steel, you're going to be near the biggest and
cheapest source of supply nationwide,'' added Gates, who has helped
24 companies, some from West Germany and Austria, expand or settle
in the area.
   The new-and-improved status may even be reflected in a 1988 Money
magazine survey that ranked the Gary-Hammond area 41st among 300
U.S. living spots _ two slots above considerably more picturesque
Honolulu and up from 92nd place a year earlier.
   That might seem surprising, considering Gary's reputation as
aging, crime-infested and polluted. City planner Taghi Arshami says
that's more myth than reality, though he concedes Gary's center
section, with a vacancy rate equal to 20 acres, is devastated.
   ``The problem we have generally for downtown is lack of
investment, lack of confidence on the part of business and on the
part of banks that are not willing to put the money down,'' he said.
   But he is optimistic about developing Gary's downtown into a
public and service sector hub, noting that 12,000 people work there.
   Some of Gary's image problems stem from lean times of the last
decade. Jobs and people disappeared, unemployment soared. Gary's
population, now about 137,000, fell 10 percent from 1980 to 1986.
Even now, experts say, growth in northwestern Indiana is occurring
in rural areas.
   The mills shrank, too, while becoming more efficient.
Northwestern Indiana now has 35,300 steelworkers, a 47 percent drop
from 1979. USS Gary Works has 7,500 workers, compared with
21,000-22,000 in the late 1970s.
   Although mill investments spur related business, some say Gary is
in a precarious position because it remains so dependent on steel.
   ``The danger of Gary is not that they aren't doing fairly well,''
said Frank Cassell, professor emeritus of industrial relations at
Northwestern University. ``(But) they're likely to delude themselves
into thinking that what they're doing is the most powerful
influence.''
   Instead, he said, bigger factors are external _ demand, the
dollar and the nation's economy. ``Gary is doing good work for
itself. That's commendable,'' he said. ``(But) one doesn't want to
think that's the whole picture.''
   Some business leaders concede the region has done a poor job of
diversifying, but others point to such changes as the growth of the
health industry, which provides 20,400 jobs in the area.
   Gary is also touting recreation. Promotional brochures feature
the Indiana Dunes and Lake Michigan, photos of children bicycling
along the beach, a golden sunset over shimmering waters and a local
boy who made good _ Michael Jackson.
   ``We have one of the largest fresh water bodies anywhere in the
world,'' Barnes said. ``We have far from taken full advantage of
it.''
   Gary hopes to rectify that with an ambitious $150-$200 million,
1,400-slip marina adjacent to the USS site that could eventually
include a hotel, shopping center and amphitheater. Officials hope to
build the first 250 slips this year.
   Gary also hopes to have the third commercial airport in the
Chicago area. Its present airport provides only charter and private
corporate service.
   An expanded airport would relieve congestion at O'Hare
International and Midway in Chicago. One report said it would
attract 6.5 million passengers to Gary annually and create 122,000
jobs with a payroll of $1.6 billion.
   Though these projects are critical, Barnes said the city also has
``a much healthier manner of looking at problems,'' whether it's
cleaning up illegal dumps or addressing housing needs.
   ``There's already a renewed spirit of cooperation that hasn't
existed in 20 years,'' said Bill Brown, transportation planner for
the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission.
   ``People,'' he said, ``feel a lot more confident about Gary's
future.''

   A kidnapped warehouse supervisor was
found shot to death Tuesday, one day after authorities watched his
abductor pick up a $25,000 ransom and escape into the night,
officials said.
   Bergen County Prosecutor John Holl said the kidnapper walked into
a heavily staked out area Monday night to pick up the ransom paid by
Marilyn Flax, the wife of the victim, Irving Flax, 58.
   Holl said FBI agents, police and officials from the Bergen County
prosecutor's office were at the drop-off site, a restaurant parking
lot on Route 4 in Paramus. They watched as a man signalled to Mrs.
Flax to drop the paper bag about 7:30 p.m., Holl said.
   After Mrs. Flax left, the man picked up the bag and drove away in
a red sedan belonging to the victim. Holl said the surveillance team
then lost track of the car.
   ``It was dark,'' he said Tuesday, adding that officials had not
been able to observe the kidnapper clearly enough to give a
description.
   The victim was found in the front seat of his car about 10:30
a.m. Tuesday by a security officer at the parking lot of the Garden
State Plaza, a shopping mall in Paramus.
   Flax, a supervisor at the LDF Trucking Warehouse in Secaucus, had
been shot in the back of the head, authorities said.
   Officials said Flax left his home for work at 9:30 a.m. Monday.
He called the warehouse an hour later and said he would not be
coming in.
   ``Subsequently Mr. Flax's wife, Marilyn Flax, received a phone
call from an unknown male caller who informed her that her husband
had been abducted and demanded a ransom payment,'' Holl said.
   Later in the day, she received another call from the same man
instructing her how to deliver the $25,000.
   Holl said autopsy results would be available Wednesday.
   He said it was not known whether Flax knew his kidnapper.

   George Herbert Walker Bush looks like a guy
who'd be more at home with the ``Whiffenpoof Song'' than ``Soul
Man.''
   But, by golly, there was the new president up on stage trying to
match licks _ and looks _ with Lee Atwater, the Wunderkind of GOP
politics and atavistic rhythm and blues man from Columbia, S.C.
   It was Saturday night at the final and finest bash of the
inaugural weekend, a rollicking party for young Americans at the
Convention Center that will go down as one of the new Republican
Party chairman's greatest triumphs.
   Atwater lived out a Chuck Barry fantasy on stage, falling to his
knees and writhing on his back while belting out ``High-Heeled
Sneakers'' with such heavy hitters as Sam Moore, Percy Sledge and
guitarists Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones and Steve Cropper of Blues
Brothers fame, as well as longtime sidekick Donald ``Duck'' Dunn on
bass.
   And there was George Bush, who practically had to be dragooned
into dancing a few ceremonial steps with the first lady at Friday
night's balls, taking it all in, giving a double thumbs-up sign and
then mounting the stage himself to accept a gleaming white Gibson
guitar marked ``THE PREZ'' from Moore, sole survivor of the soul
duo, Sam and Dave.
   Barbara Bush and several of the Bush children were among the
clapping crowd that cheered the musicians on during the frenetic jam
session.
   ``This has got to be the most active event of the inauguration,''
said Bush, in the understatement of the year. ``That was marvelous,
absolutely wonderful.''
   And when the band began beating out ``Soul Man,'' the president
dutifully began finger-picking ``THE PREZ,'' making no sound because
the guitar wasn't plugged in, but doing a mean imitation of the fish
face that Atwater assumed at the height of his guitar ecstasy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   If the Atwater affair was the only inaugural party that
registered on the Richter scale, the Texas ``Black Tie and Boots''
shindig earlier Saturday night wasn't half-bad.
   The president teased photographers _ and the crowd _ by lifting
his pants leg to offer fleeting glimpses of the map of Texas
enameled on his boots.
   It had to be the first time anyone ever yelled at Bush: ``Take
'em off!''
   ``Stop whistling at me,'' he rejoined.
   Barbara Bush cracked, ``What I ought to do is make George stand
on his head and really show you those boots.''
   The first couple tarried longer at the Texas party than they had
at any of the balls, staying to sing both ``Texas, Our Texas,'' the
state song and ``God Bless America.''

   Bush may have Martin Van Buren to thank for his example of how a
sitting vice president can capture the White House. But he also has
Van Buren to blame for the 15 stops he made in Friday's marathon
ball-hopping.
   Van Buren was the first president to have two inaugural balls,
and he infuriated supporters by attending only the higher-priced
one. Since then, every president has felt compelled to visit all the
balls, even as they multiplied into the teens.
   It meant crossing the capital in a long but silent motorcade
under moonlit skies from 8 p.m. EST Friday until 12:45 a.m. Saturday.
   The second stop, at the District of Columbia Armory, set the
pattern, with people in evening gowns and tuxedos jammed up against
the stage, armed with cameras, intent on checking out Barbara's gown
and shaking Bush's hand. Although it was a youth ball, most of the
people who had muscled to the front would never see 40 again.
   As the hours wore on, and the waits grew longer, the crowds grew
testier. When the media pool came in to block their view moments
before the president's arrival, ball-goers screamed and booed, only
to be assured by a tuxedoed Secret Service agent that the reporters
would crouch when Bush arrived.
   The newly remodeled Union Station _ still a train depot, but now
filled with chic shops as well _ looked enchanting, like a set from
a Hollywood movie of the 1940s, with the crowd of swells lined up to
greet the Bushes, who gazed down upon the scene from a balcony.
   But few stops seemed as memorable. There was no waltzing going on
when the Bushes came in _ just the same densely packed throngs
waiting for their picture or handshake.
   As the presidential party beat its retreat from one ball, a
young, dark-haired woman in evening gown desperately gave a reporter
two postcards she had hoped to give Bush: handwritten pleas for help
for relatives behind the Iron Curtain.
   A White House aide took them to forward to the president's mail
handlers.

   Life is tough in the refugee camps of
Pakistan and Iran for the millions of Afghans who fled the civil
war, but most apparently prefer it to coming home.
   More than 5 million people, about one-third of the population,
have left Afghanistan since the Moslem insurgency began after a
Communist coup in April 1978.
   By official count, just 188,000 have come back in the year since
the Soviet-backed government proclaimed ``national reconciliation''
and offered enticements to refugees who return, including a
six-month exemption from military service.
   With the deadline for Soviet withdrawal approaching and no peace
in sight, even that trickle is slowing.
   Red Army soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and an
estimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began May
15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement. Half had left by Aug. 15 and all
are to be gone by Feb. 15.
   Afghan officials accuse Pakistani bureaucrats and insurgent
leaders of siphoning off international aid intended for the refugee
camps.
   ``That Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, he's got 300 cars. ... It's from the
money for the camps,'' Mirkhall Jalla, deputy minister for
repatriation, said of one leaders of the seven-party guerrilla
alliance based in Pakistan.
   ``Pakistan, Iran, the opposition parties; they prevemt them
(refugees) from coming by force, with guns, and they plant land
mines on the border,'' he said. ``Without the refugees they have
nothing.''
   Jalla denied reports of government bribes to returning refugees,
particularly young men wanted for the army.
   He insisted in an interview that the regime of President Najib
asks no questions of returning refugees and would take no reprisals
against guerrillas or sympathizers who come home under the program.
   Even if the guerrillas believe that, they still are fighting the
Soviets and the Najib government, with aid that comes primarily from
the United States and Pakistan.
   Because the insurgents control most of the countryside, families
who fled villages devastated by Soviet and Afghan bombing raids
would return under guerrilla auspices.
   For such peasant families, fear of mines and of continuing war
after the Soviet withdrawal are major deterrents to repatriation.
Millions of mines have been planted in a decade of war.
   The map in Jalla's office has a look of unreality. Some of the
colored buttons marking 28 government reception centers for refugees
are well within guerrilla territory.
   Nearly all refugees who reach the capital are from Iran,
Afghanistan's western neighbor. Kabul's guest house has room for 700
people, but often is empty.
   The refugees' tales are similar: flight from war, hearing about
the repatriation plan and paying other Afghan exiles to take them to
the border. Young men, speaking through an official interpreter,
told a reporter they would be willing to join the army after the
six-month exemption.
   Hashem, 18, said he was barely 10 when he and an uncle fled to
Pakistan, then Iran, from their village in the central province of
Oruzgan. He is illiterate, has had no contact with his parents and
said longing for them caused his return.
   ``I heard there was a new policy,'' he said. ``I wanted to come
home. I want to see my parents. I'll go into the army when they
say.''
   No one at the Kabul center knew whether Hashem's parents were
alive.
   The U.N. refugee agency, known as the High Commissioner for
Refugees, established a Kabul office in June but Dutch director
Reinout Wanrooy said: ``There really isn't much we can do.
   ``Our expectation was that people might come back in large
numbers this spring, or before. Now we think they might wait another
year. But if things get worse after the Soviets leave, the refugee
problem in Pakistan may get worse.''
   Both Pakistan and the insurgents seem opposed to the return of
refugees, partly because the Afghan mountain fighters are more
effective without families who need protection and are in danger of
air or artillery attack.
   Little aid is available for Afghans returning home. Most Western
nations refuse to deal with Najib and expect his government to fall
after Soviet forces are gone. His government says its program could
handle a million people, but that seems doubtful in a desperately
poor nation devastated by war.
   The Soviet Union made the major contribution, $600 million, to a
$1.1 billion rehabilitation fund set up by the United Nations. But
most of that is in blankets and tents, not money.
   Afghan officials say the equivalent of about $5 million already
has been spent to bring back refugees, including compensation for
seized or destroyed property.

   Police say they shot and killed
a black man when he allegedly tried to set off a grenade while
accompanying officers on a field investigation.
   He was the fourth black man killed in the past two months during
a police on-site investigation. Two of the others died during
alleged escape attempts while handcuffed, according to police
reports.
   Police did not identify the 35-year-old man killed Monday at the
Khayelitsha black township near Cape Town. A statement from police
headquarters in Pretoria said he was linked to several slayings, but
did not say if he was charged.
   The statement said he was taken to Khayelitsha to show ``certain
sites. ... He took a hand grenade from a hole he had dug in the
ground and tried to pull the safety pin.
   ``A member of the police fatally wounded him, in a bid to prevent
him from pulling the pin,'' it said.

<HEAD>Evans Files Third-Party Candidacy For April Mayoral Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alderman Timothy Evans, bypassing the Democratic
primary in favor of a third-party bid for mayor, submitted 100,000
petition signatures Monday for a spot on the April 4 election ballot.
   Evans, running under the Harold Washington Party, named for the
city's first black mayor, said he turned in four times the number of
names needed to qualify a third-party candidacy for mayor.
   ``What you see is a testament to the thousands of people who
participated, who passed the petitions, who signed the petitions,''
Evans told a crowd of 200 supporters at City Hall.
   He is skipping the Democratic primary to avoid splitting the
black vote with Mayor Eugene Sawyer. Evans and Sawyer are both black.
   Unless the petition signatures fail to withstand challenges,
Evans will meet the winners of the Democratic and Republican
primaries in an election that will determine who serves the
remaining two years in Washington's term.
   While filing his petitions, he pledged to reform what he called
the remnants of the political ``machine'' of late Mayor Richard J.
Daley, who died 12 years ago.
   Daley's son, Cook County State's Attorney Ricard M. Daley, is the
Democratic front-runner, attracting support from whites, Hispanics
and some blacks, but Sawyer appears to be chipping away at the lead,
according to polls.
   ``We don't know who our opponents will be, but we've got to
defeat the Daley machine,'' Evans said.
   Washington suffered a heart attack and died in November 1987.
Evans was his floor leader in the City Council.

<HEAD>Yiddish Musical Opens at Public Theater</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs Planned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The bottom line about ``Songs of Paradise'' at
the off-Broadway Public Theater is that you'll enjoy it a lot more
if you understand Yiddish than if you don't.
   This retelling of the story of Genesis in Yiddish has just enough
English narration and singing to let the English-only speaker
realize that it's amusing. But there is much humor that the
non-Yiddish speaker can't share.
   ``Songs of Paradise,'' which opened Monday, is a Purimshpiel, a
telling of a biblical story in an idiomatic way. It uses broad humor
but without a tone of disrespect.
   The musical takes us through the stories of Adam and Eve; Cain
and Abel; Abraham, his wife Sarah and concubine Hagar; Essau and
Jacob; Jacob and his wives Leah and Rachel, and Joseph.
   Adam, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt, trades a bone for Eve. The
serpent is a puppet on the hand of a man dressed as a tree and
wearing a T-shirt that reads ``Don't eat the apples.''
   Essau is a Brando-like motorcyclist who trades his birthright to
Jacob for a bowl of lentil soup in ``Rifke's Diner.'' Jacob's dream,
with three angels dressed like house painters, is narrated by a TV
sports announcer.
   When Jacob gets to his uncle's house, Uncle Laban does a Groucho
Marx imitation. Leah, ``her biological clock relentlessly ticking
away,'' and Rachel fight for Jacob with boxing gloves.
   All this could be very amateurish but the performances are
amusing and professional.
   The performers, Adrienne Cooper, Rosalie Gerut, who also composed
the music, Avi Hoffman, who directed, David Kener and Eleanor
Reissa, are excellent and all have good voices. Miriam Hoffman and
Rena Berkowicz Borow wrote the book, based on biblical poetry by
Itsik Manger, who died in 1969.
   The score is serviceable. There are eclectic style inserts
including finger-snapping jazz for Eve; a cheerleading effort, with
baton, for the begats; a doo-wop song sung around Isaac's carriage,
an excerpt from ``Carmen'' (not ``the Card Song'') when Potifar's
wife tries to tell her fortune with cards.
   Miriam Hoffman founded the company which is resident at the
Riverdale YMHA and is associated with the YIVO Institute for Jewish
Research. This is its first production at the Public Theater as the
Joseph Papp Yiddish Theater.

   Crime rose sharply last year _ in part because of
economic development _ with serious crimes such as murder and
robbery increasing 65.7 percent, the vice minister of public
security was quoted today as saying.
   Vice Minister Yu Lei said 827,000 crimes were reported last year,
up 45.1 percent from 1987, the official China Daily newspaper
reported.
   He said 80 percent of all the crimes were theft.
   Yu blamed the crime increase on economic development which made
more goods and money available to some people, and on the country's
transient population _ peddlers, construction workers and drifters _
now estimated at 50 million.
   Yu said drug trafficking and smuggling by ``overseas gangs'' also
increased, but China still has one of the lowest crime rates in the
world.

   Hundreds of soldiers backed by
tanks and mortars regained control of most of an infantry base
Monday night after 15 hours of gun battles with civilian commandos
the government said were leftist guerrillas.
   Five soldiers were killed and more than 30 soldiers and police
wounded, the government news agency Telam reported. Carlos Becerra,
secretary general to President Raul Alfonsin, said at least 20
commandos were killed.
   At 9:30 p.m., a handful of commandos were holed up in an officers
club that soldiers had attacked with tanks and set on fire.
   Moments earlier, a small armory exploded, sending bright flames
100 yards high into the darkness. Sporadic gunfire and an occasional
mortar round could be heard from inside the spacious compound.
   The battles began when an estimated 30 to 50 commandos used a
stolen Coca Cola delivery truck to crash through the main gate of
the 3rd infantry regiment in La Tablada on the outskirts of Buenos
Aires.
   The casualty toll was much higher than in the three military
insurrections against Alfonsin's government during the past 21
months.
   In the military revolts of April 1987 and January and December
1988, soldiers were extremely reluctant to fire on fellow soldiers.
   The commandos did not identify themselves or state their motives.
But a woman who called the independent news agency Diarios y
Noticias said she was part of the commando group and said it acted
to prevent a military coup.
   ``It was to defend democracy and now they're massacring us,''
said the woman, who refused to identify herself or the commando
group. ``Please, do something.''
   Military officials and government spokesmen, including Alfonsin's
press secretary, Jose Ignacio Lopez, said the commandos were leftist
guerrillas and not soldiers or members of a right-wing group.
   No similar incidents were reported at other bases throughout this
South American country of 31 million.
   The officials offered little evidence to support their contention
that the commandos were leftists, but party leaders and unions from
across the political spectrum who denounced the incident did not
challenge the government's claim.
   Hundreds of area residents who gathered outside the base shouted
support for the troops. ``Kill them!'' people shouted as troops led
away commandos captured after they fled burning, smoking buildings.
   Live national television coverage showed tanks rumbling along
city streets, bleeding soldiers carried to ambulances and
helicopters, residents fleeing, and burning, smoking buildings.
   Cesar Jaroslavsky, president of the ruling Radical Civic Union's
bloc in the House of Deputies, said some of the commandos were
members of the Peoples Revolutionary Army, which engaged soldiers in
open battle a decade ago but has been inactive since. He identified
one as Jose Luis Caldu, but he provided no details.
   After entering La Tablada at about 6 a.m., the commandos found
themselves trapped almost immediately when Buenos Aires provincial
police surrounded the base 12 miles northwest of the capital.
   By early afternoon, the commandos were confined to the red brick
officers club and several other buildings. Soldiers, including
members of an elite paratroop brigade, blasted the buildings with
tanks and mortars and set them on fire.
   Some fled the base and hid out in buildings, firing sniper-style
at police and soldiers, local news agencies reported. The firing
dropped off after nightfall, leading to speculation that some
commandos escaped.
   The incident was the most serious of its kind since a combined
attack by Montonero and ERP guerrillas on the Monte Chingolo army
arsenal, nine miles south of Buenos Aires, in 1975.
   Government House in downtown Buenos Aires, where Alfonsin was at
work Monday, and the president's official residence in suburban
Olivos, were reinforced with additional troops.
   Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena and army chief Gen. Francisco
Gassino took steps to retake the La Tablada base immediately and
sent elite airborne troops to assist soldiers and provincial police.
   Only about 100 officers and troops were at La Tablada at the time
of the attack, and the rest were spending the weekend off base,
Telam said. Several dozen escaped from captivity after the
counterattack began.
   Buenos Aires provincial police quickly surrounded the base,
evacuated some area residents, diverted traffic and took up
sharpshooter positions in homes and buildings.
   The commandos threw out pamphlets saying ``Long Live Rico!'' and
``Long Live Seineldin!'' as they entered the base. They referred to
the leaders of the three military insurrections, cashiered Lt. Col.
Aldo Rico and Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin.
   The pamphlets created the impression the commandos were
right-wingers who supported the military position that the trials of
officers for human rights abuses committed during the 1976-83
military dictatorship should be terminated.
   Rico and Seineldin, both of whom are in military prison, had
demanded cancellation of the trials and amnesty for those officers
already convicted.
   Military sources said the commandos may have intended only to
steal weapons from the base and depart quickly, leaving the
pamphlets behind to throw off pursuers.

<TEXT>
   ``Rain Man'' and ``Twins'' had the highest box
office receipts for the sixth straight weekend as many would-be
moviegoers stayed home to watch the Super Bowl.
   Three weeks into the new year, it was also evident that studios
were intent on wringing out the old. There were no new releases in
the weekly top 10, and movies on the list have been in circulation
an average six weeks.
   Holding on handily to No. 1 was the Dustin Hoffman-Tom Cruise
film ``Rain Man,'' which took in $7 million in its sixth week of
release for a gross of $79.5 million.
   ``Twins,'' with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito as
brothers separated at birth, finished second with $4.82 million and
a seven-week gross of $80.4 million.
   It was the fourth straight weekend that the films finished in
that order. The previous two weekends, ``Twins'' finished ahead of
``Rain Man.''
   A female duo in ``Beaches,'' starring Bette Midler and Barbara
Hershey, took third place with $4.79 million. ``The Accidental
Tourist'' was fourth with $3.3 million.
   Fifth place went to ``Working Girl'' at $3.1 million.
   ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!'' was sixth,
``Mississippi Burning'' was seventh and ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels''
was eighth.
   The newest entry in the top 10 was ``Deep Star Six,'' barely
hanging on with a $1.39 million gross at No. 9 in its second week of
release.
   Rounding out the list was Disney's animated film ``Oliver and
Co.,'' which has taken in $48.1 million after 10 weeks.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co., with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Rain Man,'' United Artists, $7 million, 1,509 screens,
$4,641 per screen, $79.5 million, six weeks.
   2. ``Twins,'' Universal, $4.82 million, 1,640 screens, $2,940 per
screen, $80.4 million, seven weeks.
   3. ``Beaches,'' Disney, $4.79 million, 809 screens, $5,921 per
screen, $13.2 million, five weeks.
   4. ``The Accidental Tourist,'' Warner Bros., $3.3 million, 954
screens, $3,474 per screen, $18.3 million, five weeks.
   5. ``Working Girl,'' 20th Century Fox, $3.1 million, 1,148
screens, $2,681 per screen, $34.2 million, five weeks.
   6. ``The Naked Gun,'' Paramount, $3 million, 1,687 screens,
$1,796 per screen, $64.5 million, eight weeks.
   7. ``Mississippi Burning,'' Orion, $2.7 million, 568 screens,
$4,674 per screen, $10.1 million, seven weeks.
   8. ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' Orion, $2.1 million, 1,515
screens, $1,391 per screen, $34.1 million, six weeks.
   9. ``Deep Star Six,'' Tri-Star, $1.39 million, 1,118 screens,
$1,227 per screen, $5.6 million, two weeks.

<TEXT>
   Those beach-bronzed Aussies are paler
this southern summer because, they say, the fabled Sydney shores are
too polluted for safety.
   State officials claim pollution is no worse than 30 years ago,
but a cleanup of Sydney Harbor by 20,000 volunteers this month
produced tons of garbage including a car, 3,000 syringes and
hundreds of tires and shopping carts.
   Lifeguards are getting vaccinations against hepatitis B because
of the dirty water, syringes and broken glass.
   ``You don't need to be a scientist to realize that things are
getting worse,'' said Barton Lynch, world surfing champion, who will
not train at the well-known Bondi and Manly beaches because of
pollution.
   Des Renford, who swam the English Channel, said he has stopped
training at many of Sydney's 37 beaches ``solely due to the
pollution.''
   Some are ``in a disgusting state,'' he said, and drew this
comparison: ``Polluting the ocean is like pouring sewage over the
Opera House.''
   On Monday, The Daily Telegraph joined radio station 2Day in
asking the New South Wales government to clean up the mess.
   ``Give us back our beaches,'' the newspaper said in an appeal to
Nick Greiner, the state premier. It said the ``gross pollution of
Sydney's beaches is an immense problem'' that could frustrate the
effort to attract more than 2 million tourists a year.
   ``At the very least, it is stopping tourists getting full
enjoyment from their holidays,'' the Daily Telegraph declared. ``At
worst, it is turning them off, and away.''
   Surfline, which monitors beach pollution daily, said it had
issued 170 warnings since the Southern Hemisphere summer began Oct.
1 and that six beaches were hazardous.
   ``We don't want to cause a major panic, but something has to be
done,'' said Gus Staunton of the Surf Life Saving Association, which
is associated with Surfline. ``It is a major health risk.''
   His group said Monday it is encouraging its 64,000 members to be
vaccinated against hepatitis B because of the health risks involved
in patrolling beaches and saving lives.
   ``Lifesavers fall into a much higher risk than most because they
are often required to rescue people who are bleeding from injury or
who need mouth-to-mouth resuscitation,'' said Ian Mackie,
association medical officer.
   ``In addition, there are an increasing number of used
(hypodermic) needles being found on Australian beaches, and if they
accidentally pricked themselves they could end up with the
disease,'' he said.
   Water Board spokesman Christopher Speary said the state
government was spending $490 million ($400 million U.S.) to build
three long-range ocean outfalls and upgrade existing sewage and
industrial waste treatment facilities.
   ``By 1991 the problem will be fixed,'' he told The Associated
Press.
   Speary said 1 million tons of sewage is dumped each day off
Sydney, a city of 3.5 million residents. He blamed complaints of
pollution on isolated incidents like a huge oil slick three weeks
ago and the dumping of more than 500 gallons of paint by mistake.
   ``I don't accept the beaches are now more polluted than they were
30 years ago,'' he said.
   Existing sewage outlets were built during the Edwardian era, when
neck-to-knee suits were required for bathing and ``Sydney was a very
small town,'' Speary said. ``Nobody could have known it would grow
into the sprawling metropolis that it has.''
   The Water Board sponsors television commercials asking housewives
not to pour oil and other greasy substances down kitchen drains.
   ``We're spending millions of dollars to clean the beaches but you
won't be able to see where it's going,'' one says.

   The highest courts of the state and the
nation refused Monday night to block the Tuesday morning execution
of Ted Bundy, who during the last three days confessed to 20 murders
in Western states.
   The 42-year-old law school dropout was described as subdued and
emotional as he met with psychiatrist Dorothy Lewis, apparently as
part of his lawyers' preparations for a possible last-minute
argument that Bundy was mentally incompetent to be executed.
   Gov. Martinez told reporters in Tallahassee, three psychiatrists
were standing by to examine Bundy if necessary and certify his
mental competency.
   After confessing during the weekend to two Colorado murders, he
talked with Colorado investigators again Monday, but disclosed no
information about three unsolved slayings in the state, officials
said.
   Bundy also met with James Dobson, host of a California Christian
radio show, during the afternoon. In a one-hour interview, Dobson
said, Bundy tearfully expressed ``great remorse'' but wanted to
stress that he believes hard-core pornography ``was the fuel for his
fantasies'' that spurred him into violent crimes.
   Dobson, a psychologist whose show ``Focus on the Family'' is
heard daily on about 1,300 radio stations, said Bundy admitted he
was a murderer and said society had a right to protect itself from
people ``with his weakness.''
   Dobson said Bundy now is ``thankful that ... again he is in touch
with his feelings and his guilt and he feels great remorse for what
he's done.''
   Bundy was scheduled to die in Florida's electric chair at 7 a.m.
Tuesday for the 1978 kidnap-murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach of
Lake City. He also was convicted of killing two sorority sisters in
Tallahassee in 1978.
   U.S. Supreme Court justices voted 5-4 to reject an emergency
request aimed at keeping Bundy alive until a formal appeal could be
filed with the nation's highest court. The justices had four times
previously rejected formal appeals from Bundy.
   Bundy's lawyers argued that jurors in the Leach case were misled
about the importance of their role in determining whether Bundy
would receive the death penalty or life in prison for his crime. In
Florida, juries in capital cases recommend a punishment, but the
presiding judge is free to accept or reject the recommendation.
   The justices rejected a related argument by a 6-3 vote, and they
voted 7-2 to turn down a request to delay the execution until the
high court could hear an appeal claiming that Bundy's death sentence
was tainted because his lawyers were not shown all the information
considered in the sentencing.
   The attorneys also filed an appeal in state Supreme Court,
claiming the jury instructions were improper. The state Supreme
Court on Monday night denied his request for a stay and denied
related requests for stays so that higher courts could review it,
said Supreme Court deputy clerk Tanya Carroll.
   ``We gave him nothing,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, a forensic psychologist in Portland, Ore., said he
believes Bundy started his killings in the East long before the
Seattle murder that is the first publicly linked to the condemned
killer, The Oregonian newspaper reported in Tuesday's editions.
   The psychologist, Art Norman, spent 90 to 100 hours interviewing
Bundy over 15 months in 1986 and 1987 while working on Bundy's first
appeal of his death sentences. Bundy attended Temple University in
Philadelphia in 1969.
   It is the fourth time an execution has been set for Bundy.
   But this weekend, he began confessing to a string of murders. He
has been linked to as many as 36 killings and disappearances of
young women in Washington, Colorado, Utah and other Western states.
   But Colorado Attorney General Duane Woodard accused him of
stringing along investigators to avoid or delay execution.
   Martinez said the execution would go forward whether or not Bundy
has time to tell all he knows about killings and locations of bodies.
   ``I think the way in which Ted perhaps is using the confessions
to bargain for time with the law enforcement people has been
difficult for some folks to deal with,'' the Rev. David Ernst,
pastor of the Tacoma, Wash., church where Bundy's family worships
weekly, said in an interview Sunday.
   A San Diego man, William Taylor, asked Martinez to put off the
execution until Bundy could say if he was involved in the January
1968 disappearance of his sister in Concord, N.H.
   Martinez aide Brian Ballard said Monday that even the
approximately 100 requests similar to Taylor's would not make the
governor delay the execution.
   It's easy to see how people who oppose the death penalty on
principle make an exception for Bundy, said Kathleen Taylor of the
American Civil Liberties Union in Seattle. ``Anybody in their right
mind hates that man. You're going get that kind of emotional
response,'' she said.
   Once cocky and confident in the courtroom, Bundy acted Monday
like a man who believed his time may be running out, a prison
spokesman said.
   ``He's more emotional and subdued,'' than under the previous
three death warrants, said Bob Macmaster, a prison spokesman.
   ``He knows what he is doing. He knows why he is confessing. His
only remorse is that he got caught and he's going to die,'' said
Hugh Aynesworth, co-author of a Bundy book called ``The Only Living
Witness.''
   Salt Lake County sheriff's Detective Dennis Couch said Sunday
that Bundy mentioned his involvement in up to eight Utah killings,
two more than authorities had suspected. Earlier Sunday, Bundy
confessed to two murders in Idaho, where officials had never linked
him to any killings.
   Idaho Attorney General Jim Jones said a number of police agencies
were asked to come to Boise to talk about Bundy and determine which
old cases might be connected with his confession.
   Bundy also provided investigators Friday and Saturday with
details of eight Washington killings and two in Colorado for which
he has long been suspected, authorities said.
   Michael Radelet, a University of Florida sociology professor and
Bundy's paralegal assistant for a decade, said there was
disagreement in the Bundy camp about his decision to talk about the
crimes.
   ``For the last three days, I've been trying to get him to shut
up. The way he's doing it now is a sideshow and a circus,'' he said,
adding Bundy should have provided details only through his lawyers.

<HEAD>North and South Korea In Biggest Peace Drive Since Korean War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South Korea and North Korea are
involved in the biggest drive since the Korean War to reduce the
tensions between them. The bitter rivals are talking about
everything from a non-aggression pact to trade and cultural
exchanges.
   In recent months they have bombarded each other with proposals on
ending their 40-year confrontation, and both show a willingness to
talk that would have been unthinkable even a year ago.
   ``Expectations are running high for achieving peace and stability
on the basis of improved relations with North Korea and working
together toward the long-range objective of reunification,'' The
Korea Times said in a Jan. 19 editorial.
   But even optimistic observers warn against expecting a sudden
breakthrough. They say that long and difficult negotiations will be
needed to make even minimal progress. Past talks on improving
relations have failed.
   ``Just the fact that they are talking is a big step, and the wide
range of possible contacts is unprecedented,'' said a Western
diplomatic observer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The two nations technically are still at war since they did not
sign a peace treaty at the end of the Korean War in 1953. Each
claims to be the legitimate government of Korea.
   North Korea agreed Jan. 16 to a South Korean proposal for talks
between the nations' prime ministers in what would be the highest
level of contact ever between the sides. Preliminary talks are to
begin Feb. 8 on procedural issues.
   Lawmakers from both sides are to resume meeting Feb. 10 on
clearing the way for separate parliamentary talks on a
non-aggression agreement and other issues.
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo said on Jan. 17 his government
was working on a new policy under which the two sides could work as
partners. South Korea no longer wanted to see the communist nation
as an enemy, he said.
   ``Besides clearing the way for trade and exchanges between South
and North Korea, I will realize inter-Korean summit talks in the
near future and achieve epoch-making progress in resolving the
Korean question,'' he said.
   Trade has begun for the first time, with Seoul importing North
Korean goods in small quantities and South Korean companies seeking
permission for deals worth tens of millions of dollars. North Korea
has indicated it may accept joint economic ventures, Seoul officials
say.
   The chairman of South Korea's powerful Hyundai conglomerate,
Chung Ju-yung, left Saturday for North Korea on the first-ever visit
by a top South Korean businessman to discuss possible trade ventures.
   Proposals have been made for personnel and cultural exchanges,
including visits to the north by South Korean students, academics
and doctors. But the north has indicated such exchanges may depend
on political progress.
   South Korea, long one of the world's most anti-communist nations,
is making strides in developing ties with the Soviet Union, China
and other allies of North Korea to ease tensions and persuade
Pyongyang to seek better relations.
   The United States has expressed guarded hope that the peace
feelers could produce major changes. About 42,000 U.S. troops are
based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   The Korean peninsula is one of the world's major trouble spots.
Hundreds of thousands of heavily armed troops on both sides face
each other on the 150-mile border and the archrivals have clashed
repeatedly over the years.
   The border is sealed and the the only link is a single hot line.
The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by U.S. and Soviet forces,
which ended the Japanese colonial occupation.
   Chances of improving relations depend largely on how serious
North Korea is about changing its stance toward the south, South
Korean officials and Western diplomats say. There are signs that
little has changed in the north.
   North Korean leader Kim Il Sung continues to rule over one of the
world's most repressive totalitarian states. Kim launched the 1950
invasion that started the Korean War and still talks of
``liberating'' the south.
   There is no sign of Soviet style reforms in North Korea, and
there may be little hope of major change while Kim rules. North
Korea often has attacked the south and it was widely blamed for the
1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed all 115 people
aboard.
   But North Korea reportedly faces growing problems.
   Its economy is collapsing after years of mismanagement, and the
south's increasingly powerful economy may be the best hope of help,
the South Korean officials and diplomats said. Moreover, North Korea
may fear international isolation if it continues its belligerent
position, they said.
   Seoul officials concede the north may be trying to use the talks
to secure withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea. Pyongyang has
said the annual U.S.-South Korea Team Spirit military exercises must
end if there is to be progress in negotiations.
   Despite his optimism, Roh said any progress would be gradual and
stressed the need for a strong defense and retaining U.S. forces. He
ruled out unilateral arms cuts by Seoul.
   Roh also is seen as having political motives for pushing for a
breakthrough. His government lacks support among many South Koreans
and the president hopes his ``northern policy'' may reduce domestic
opposition, even if it fails.

<HEAD>Meat Producers Want More Review Time for Reg Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meat producers say the Agriculture Department
should give them more time to review proposed changes in federal
regulations designed to ensure the safety of precooked hamburgers
and certain other kinds of meat patties.
   The American Meat Institute said Monday that a 30-day comment
period does not give the industry enough time to study rules
proposed by the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service on
Dec. 27.
   The proposed rules would establish requirements for the storage
of raw ingredients, processing times and temperatures, handling to
prevent contamination after processing, and labels that include
cooking instructions.
   Last month, agency administrator Lester M. Crawford said there
had been ``increasing evidence over the past several years that
food-borne pathogens survive in products that many consumers
erroneously consider to be fully cooked.''
   But George D. Wilson, the meat institute's vice president of
science and prepared meats, said in a letter to the federal agency
that ``contrary to suggestions in the proposal, AMI fails to see the
grounds for associating a public health emergency with the
production and consumption of precooked meat patties.''
   Products that would be covered by the rules include items
marketed as ``char-broiled beef patties'' and ``pre-browned fresh
pork sausage patties,'' according to Crawford.
   Recently, he said, a bacterial strain was linked to an outbreak
of food poisoning which hospitalized six Minnesota school children
with severe diarrhea and cramps.
   Crawford said the Centers for Disease Control determined that
undercooked beef patties caused the illness, although the specific
bacterial strain that infected the children has not been isolated.
   Crawford said that under the proposed rules, for example, a label
for partially cooked ground meat patties would bear the statement,
``Partially Cooked: For Safety, Cook Until Well Done (Internal
Temperature of 160 F).''
   Wilson, disputing the need for such rules, said Agriculture
Department laboratory tests ``did not confirm the presence'' of the
specific bacteria implicated in the Minnesota incident.
   Wilson said the proposal ``was hastily prepared using an
associated, but inappropriate, data base resulting in a proposed
regulation which is a product safety `overkill' and is commercially
impractical.''

   Dairy farmers are still feeling cost effects of
last year's drought, but Agriculture Department analysts say 1989
milk output could still edge higher to another record.
   ``Drought-caused increases in feed costs probably will have some
effect on milk output in the first half, but 1989 milk production is
likely to total about the same or slightly higher than the year
before,'' the department's Economic Research Service said Monday.
   Milk production rose to a record level of 145.3 billion pounds in
1988, due entirely to a boost of almost 3 percent in milk output per
cow. The number of cows declined by 1 percent to a record low
average of 10.2 million head during the year.
   ``Any production rises should be easily absorbed by a 1 percent
to 3 percent rise in commercial use,'' the report said. ``Government
purchases probably will decline to 5 billion to 7 billion pounds,
milk equivalent, from 8.8 billion in 1988.''
   The department buys surplus cheese, butter and non-fat dry milk
to support the price of milk paid to farmers by dealers.
   Retail dairy prices rose in December and are higher than they
have been in recent years at this time, the report said. Over all of
1989, retail prices of dairy products are expected to gain an
average of 2 percent to 4 percent, compared with last year's 2
percent.
   ``A late-1988 surge in domestic commercial use of milk and dairy
products is combining with a vigorous export demand for non-fat dry
milk to create strong dairy markets in early 1989,'' the report said.

   The Agriculture Department says it will begin
charging a fee for the voluntary or industry-solicited inspection of
tobacco for export.
   J. Patrick Boyle, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, said Monday the fee will be $0.0025 per pound, or
a rate of 25 cents per 100 pounds of tobacco. He said the fee will
recover costs of salaries and other expenses.
   The new fee, scheduled to take effect Jan. 24, does not affect
charges for any inspection or grading service for tobacco used
domestically, he said.

   An advocacy group says that despite George
Bush's liberal-bashing in last year's campaign, liberal politicians
and issues fared well in the elections and are poised to make their
mark in the 101st Congress.
   The group, Americans for Democratic Action, based its prediction
in part on an analysis of the voting records of members of Congress
in 1988, which showed the House of Representatives with a ``liberal
quotient'' of 52 percent, the highest figure since ADA began rating
voting records in 1947.
   In the Senate, the average score was 48 percent on the key
liberal-conservative issues selected by ADA for its ratings.
   The group's national director, Marc Pearl, noted that senators
who were up for re-election last year averaged higher liberal scores
than the rest of the Senate, ``and their liberal voting records
proved not to be a liability.''
   An exception Pearl did not mention was Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of
Connecticut, at 90 percent the highest-scoring Senate Republican,
who was beaten last November by Democrat Joseph Lieberman.
   ``Because so many champions of social and economic justice have
been elected and re-elected, and the Democrats have added seats in
both chambers, the prospects for holding President Bush accountable
on his campaign pledge to create a `kinder, gentler nation' appear
excellent,'' Pearl said in a statement.
   He noted that even Bush raised many issues during the campaign
which the ADA considers part of its legislative agenda, including
child care, education and environmental protection.
   ``In spite of the gratuitous rhetorical beating that liberals
took during the presidential campaign, support for our agenda
remained strong and solid, Pearl said.
   Pearl also noted that in the Senate leadership, Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., who had a 55 percent ADA rating in 1988, has been replaced
as majority leader by Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, who had a 95
percent rating.
   ``A new Congress and a new president have the responsibility to
restore the social and economic balance that was so severely
shredded during the Reagan years,'' Pearl said. ``Given the results
of 1988, we are optimistic that the 101st Congress will have the
muscle to do it.''
   The ADA vote ratings for each chamber are based on a set of 20
floor votes on bills and amendments that the organization believes
most clearly reflect liberal-conservative differences. Issues
include civil rights, labor issues, women's rights, foreign and
military policy.
   Twenty-four House members, all Democrats, scored 100 percent,
along with two Senate Democrats. Twenty-five House members, all
Republicans, had scores of zero, along with 11 Senate Republicans.

   Raising Social Security benefits for a few
million retirees who think they are being discriminated against
because of the ``notch'' problem could jeopardize the entire pension
system, government auditors and other witnesses told a Senate panel.
   ``The argument that the notch represents a major inequity is not
compelling,'' says the General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress
that oversees federal agencies.
   Many of the 6.6 million to 7 million people who were born between
1917 and 1921 _ the so-called ``notch babies'' _ think otherwise.
They have been complaining to their lobbyists and members of
Congress for several years that they are being robbed of part of
their monthly Social Security checks.
   But even if there were merit to solving the problem, ``doing so
may not be a prudent course of action at this time,'' Joseph F.
Delfico, senior associate director of GAO, told the Senate Finance
Social Security subcommittee Monday.
   He cited the competing needs ``to reduce deficits, meet other
pressing national needs and maintain the Social Security system on a
path toward financial health.''
   The problem was created in 1977, when Congress cut back a
generous cost-of-living-allowance formula enacted in 1972. The new
formula was phased in and affected those born from 1917 through 1921.
   As a result, some retirees born a year or two before 1917 can get
about $100 more a month in pensions than can a person under similar
circumstances who was born during the notch period. The difference
in benefits for those two groups is called the notch.
   ``We are concerned that you and your colleagues have
underestimated the damage to the integrity of the Social Security
system that the notch and the failure to correct it has caused,''
Bruce Sumner, a director of the National Committee to Preserve
Social Security and Medicare, told the subcommittee.
   But the American Association of Retired Persons and the National
Council of Senior Citizens urged Congress not to tinker with the law
for the benefit of the notch babies.
   ``To focus on the unwarranted demands of one small group of
beneficiaries could threaten the fiscal soundness of Social
Security, thereby affecting everyone,'' said Eugene Lehrmann of
Madison, Wis., vice chairman of AARP.
   Hardest hit by the notch problem are high-earning retirees who
had long careers and worked past their 62nd birthday.
   Some bills propose to correct the problem by raising Social
Security taxes, which would affect most workers. Others would reduce
benefits to those born before 1917; still others would boost
benefits for the notch group and pay for the increase by raising the
federal deficit.
   Using existing Social Security trust funds for this purpose
``could put the system at additional risk should we experience an
economic downturn in the next few years,'' said GAO's Delfico.
   Robert J. Myers, former chief actuary for the Social Security
system, chaired a special non-government, nonpartisan panel of
Social Security experts that studied the notch problem. The panel,
he told the Finance subcommittee, ``recommends that Congress take no
legislative action on the notch benefit issue.''
   ``The real problem ... is that those persons who were born before
1917 who worked well beyond age 62 after 1978 receive undue
windfalls,'' Myers said. ``Those born after 1916 are equitably
treated, consistent with the intent of Congress, and receive proper
benefit amounts.
   ``There is no reason why younger workers should, over the years,
pay more taxes to provide windfall benefits to this group,'' Myers
said. ``Conversely, although there is a case for reducing (gradually
or otherwise) the windfall benefits for some persons born before
1917, this would not now be equitable.''

<HEAD>Couple In 80s Found After Missing At Sea Five Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple in their 80s who had been
missing at sea for almost five days _ four of them without food or
fresh water _ were plucked from an island on the South Carolina
coast by a Marine helicopter Monday.
   ``I'm telling you it was worth all the tea in China'' to see that
helicopter, Thomas Pettigrew, 81, said from a hospital bed at
Beaufort Memorial Hospital where he and his 80-year-old wife, Katie,
were listed in fair condition.
   The Pettigrews left Charleston early Thursday on a day-long
fishing trip in their 18-foot fiberglass boat.
   After being blown out to sea, running out of gas and being tossed
about in 12-foot waves, the craft washed up late Saturday on Bay
Point Island, about 50 miles southwest of Charleston.
   The couple were spotted Monday afternoon by a helicopter on a
training exercise from the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort,
authorities said.
   They were transported to the hospital by the helicopter, said
Petty Officer James Turner of the Charleston Coast Guard Base.
   The Coast Guard had started a search of the offshore waters
Friday after the couple were reported overdue at the Lockwood
Municipal Marina. But the search was suspended late Sunday.
   A storm system that moved through the area over the weekend
brought winds of 25 to 45 mph. Temperatures dropped to 35 degrees in
Charleston early Sunday.
   ``Considering the fact that they have had no food for four days
and significant exposure, I think they're doing great,'' said Dr.
Lester Haddad, the director of the emergency room at the hospital.
   ``When they got to the hospital, the first thing we gave them was
a good meal,'' he added.
   He said the couple would remain in the hospital at least
overnight for observation and treatment for exposure.
   Pettigrew said he never gave up hope through the ordeal with his
wife of 44 years.
   ``No, I always had hope. I didn't give up my hopes,'' he said.
   Pettigrew added he had no doubt the couple would be rescued when
they washed ashore on the island.
   ``I wasn't afraid of anything no more once I got on that
island,'' he said. ``I knew I was on dry land. I was hoping I would
get something to eat.''
   Lt. Quain Kahler of the Coast Guard said there was a caretaker's
cottage on the uninhabited island about 500 yards off the beach
where the couple could have gotten food. But he said the couple
didn't know it was there.
   Haddad said the couple is doing well and ``it's nice to have a
happy story to report for once.''

<HEAD>Ruling Hinders Efforts to Help Minority Businesses, Rights Leaders
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights leaders say the Supreme Court's
latest affirmative action ruling puts a chill on efforts by states
and cities to help minority businesses.
   But others say the potential harm from the decision can be
overcome with more careful development of remedies to past
discrimination.
   The justices ruled 6-3 in an opinion released Monday to strike
down a Richmond, Va., plan that set aside 30 percent of the value of
public works projects for companies at least half owned by
minorities.
   The quota violated the Constitution by imposing reverse
discrimination on white-owned contractors, the court said.
   ``The court's decision is a grievous blow to the struggle of
blacks to gain a fair share of the American dream,'' said Benjamin
L. Hooks, executive director of the NAACP. ``One would have to be
blind not to know that racial discrimination flourishes in the
construction business, and this decision will help ensure that it
continues.''
   But Hooks and others said the ruling is far from the death knell
for affirmative action.
   ``You have to show with more particularity that there is
discrimination,'' said John Payton, a lawyer who argued Richmond's
case before the high court. ``I don't think the court meant to
articulate a standard (for upholding an affirmative plan) that can't
be met.''
   Ron Ellis of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said the ruling ``means
the court is going to require much more dotting of I's and crossing
of T's before remedial plans can go into effect. That creates more
of a burden for state and local governments.''
   The ruling could have far-reaching impact on public works
set-aside programs, and possibly other forms of affirmative action
as well.
   Most states and more than 190 local governments have such
set-aside programs, according to a study by the Minority Business
Enterprise Legal Defense Education Fund.
   Executive Director J. Thomas Cochran of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, which supports set-asides, said, ``Many set-aside programs
could come to a halt and the delivery of municipal services would be
jeopardized.''
   But Jim Supica, president of the Associated General Contractors,
welcomed the ruling and said business leaders should respond by
voluntarily eliminating bias.
   ``The injustices that some construction contractors have suffered
under quota requirements have surely brought home to us the
injustices visited upon minority enterprises by the discrimination
that existed in our history but which has no place in today's
society,'' he said.
   The decision also was applauded by the Anti-Defamation League of
B'Nai B'rith as ``a firm rejection of the false concept that each
racial group is entitled to its share of public jobs and contracts.''
   Writing for the court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that
Richmond, once the seat of the old Confederacy and now with a
majority of blacks on its governing body, improperly relied on
``past societal discrimination'' to justify the quota.
   ``None of the evidence presented by the city points to any
identified discrimination in the Richmond construction industry,''
she said.
   Richmond's population is about half black. The city's
minority-owned businesses historically have received less than 1
percent of the value of the city's public building contracts,
according to court records.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a stinging dissent, said the ruling
``sounds a full-scale retreat from the court's longstanding
solicitude to race-conscious remedial efforts.''
   ``Today's decision marks a deliberate and giant step backward in
this court's affirmative action jurisprudence,'' he said.
   The court in recent years has upheld key affirmative action
programs in many areas, although always by narrow margins and with
no clear consensus on how to evaluate their lawfulness.
   Monday's decision is in contrast to a 1980 ruling that upheld a
congressional plan requiring that 10 percent of federal public works
contracts be earmarked for minority-controlled businesses.
   O'Connor said Congress has unique power to legislate against

   Queen Elizabeth II once had a musical tribute
composed just for her by Duke Ellington, but 31 years passed before
it got its first live public performance.
   The queen's daughter, Anne, was guest of honor at a Royal
Festival Hall benefit concert Monday night to hear the 15-minute
work, ``The Queen's Suite,'' performed by U.S. musician Bob Wilber
and his band.
   ``Duke was so overwhelmed at meeting with the queen in 1958 that
he composed this longer orchestral work for her, recorded it with
his band and instructed that only a single disc should be pressed,
for the queen herself,'' Wilber said in a preconcert interview.
   Because no sheet music existed, Wilber transcribed it by
listening to the music, which Ellington's son, Mercer, allowed to be
issued on a disc for public sale in 1976, two years after his
father's death.
   ``Duke set a precedent for his extended music with `The Queen's
Suite' because it's about nature,'' Wilber said. ``All his previous
compositions were about city life. This is in six parts and is about
sunsets, insects, birds, animals and the single petal of a rose.''
   Wilber described ``The Queen's Suite'' as a ``short, pretty work
considered by musicians and critics comparable with Duke's other
longer compositions.''

   Former tennis star Bjorn Borg's planned
marriage to Italian rock singer Loredana Berte has been stopped by
the Roman Catholic Church, a Borg aide said.
   ``Loredana and Borg are deeply shocked,'' Ingemar Alverdal told
the Swedish news agency TT on Monday.
   Alverdal said he did not know why the church had intervened, and
he declined to speculate.
   The couple had planned to marry in Milan on Feb. 26.
   Borg previously was married to Romanian-born tennis player
Mariana Simonescu. The new agency speculated that Borg's marriage to
Simonescu could be an embarrassing factor in Italy as it was a
Greek-Orthodox ceremony.

   Lawyer Howard Weitzman, who successfully
defended John De Lorean on cocaine conspiracy and fraud charges,
said the former auto executive owes him $683,392 in unpaid legal
fees.
   ``Sometimes I don't understand clients, and he's one of them,''
Weitzman said. ``If it wasn't for me he'd certainly be in a
different position than he's in now.''
   A Superior Court lawsuit filed Dec. 16 by Weitzman and his law
firm alleges De Lorean has failed to pay the legal bills or to
respond to letters sent to him.
   Attorney Karen Randall, who is handling the lawsuit for
Weitzman's law firm, said De Lorean had agreed orally in April 1986
to certain legal services involving a federal tax trial in Detroit.
   De Lorean was found innocent in that case, which dealt with
charges of fraud, racketeering and income tax evasion. Weitzman
earlier won acquittal in the Los Angeles cocaine and fraud case.
   De Lorean, who lives in New York, declined through Detroit lawyer
Mayer Morganroth to comment on the lawsuit.

   Phil Donahue's talk show, which will be taped
next week at the Las Vegas Hilton, created traffic jams as residents
lined up to get free tickets.
   ``It was a mess to say the least,'' said police Sgt. Steve
Tuggle. ``There were some very anxious people out there waiting for
tickets.''
   KLAS-TV had planned to begin the ticket giveaway at 9 a.m.
Monday, but motorists began lining up at 7 a.m. and the station
started handing out the tickets at 8 a.m. Within two hours, the
traffic was so bad that police asked the station to stop handing out
tickets until another distribution site could be found.
   All 15,000 tickets to the five shows were given out by
midafternoon.

   Soul singer James Brown apologized to the
people of Augusta after receiving a six-year prison term for
pleading guilty to misdemeanor weapons and traffic charges.
   ``If I had it all to do over again, I just wouldn't do it,''
Brown told the judge Monday.
   ``I hope this is behind us,'' said Brown. ``My life has always
been a model, and I just don't feel good about it now.''
   Besides the prison term, Brown, who also pleaded no contest to
charges of driving under the influence, was fined $1,000 by Judge
Gayle B. Hamrick.
   Brown's sentence would run concurrently with a six-year term he
is serving in South Carolina, Hamrick said. The charges stemmed from
a two-state car chase last September.

<HEAD>Cocaine Turns Up In Fruit Pulp, Anchovies and Beeswax, Customs Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocaine mixed up in shipments of fruit pulp and
anchovies were among U.S. Customs Service discoveries that led to
record seizures in the past three months.
   ``A lot of it is coming in by ship, which have these tremendously
huge containers,'' Customs spokesman Dennis Shimkoski said Monday as
he announced seizures of almost 23 tons of cocaine in the first
quarter of fiscal 1989.
   ``Sometimes it's in hollowed-out lumber,'' he said. ``We've found
it in shipments of beeswax, fruit pulp, industrial gear boxes,
anchovies and false walls of containers.''
   Occasionally, bags of the drug were interspersed in huge
containers of items such as chocolates, bulk lumber and fruit pulp,
but sometimes the cocaine was just mixed in with such cargo,
requiring it to be cooked out later, he said.
   ``With the technology that they use, the sky's the limit on what
they'll try next,'' said Shimkoski.
   According to Customs figures announced Monday, the service seized
45,530 pounds of cocaine _ just short of 23 tons _ between Oct. 1
and Dec. 31, 1988, which is the first quarter of fiscal 1989. That
was 11,276 more pounds than in the same months in 1987, a one-third
increase, he said.
   Much of the cocaine found mixed with other cargo was discovered
through the Automated Commercial System, which uses computers to
compare cargo manifests to find ``who the high-risk importers might
be, or the high-risk imports,'' Shimkoski said.
   For the entire 1988 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 1988,
customs officers took in a record high 138,808 pounds of cocaine,
nearly as much as they took in the two previous years combined.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration is estimating that cocaine
production overseas is decreasing in fiscal 1989 from a high in
fiscal 1988.
   This would mean that the dramatic increase in seizures by Customs
in the first quarter of fiscal 1989 reflected an actual cut in the
amount of cocaine coming in, not just a cut in a much larger supply,
said DEA spokesman Maurice Hill.
   ``Without a doubt,'' it's a cut in imports, Hill said. ``But you
realize with the numbers we're dealing with, it's not a dent.''
   In fiscal 1989, production of finished cocaine by the four major
producing countries _ Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador _ will
range from 708,400 pounds to 919,600 pounds, according to DEA
estimates.
   Meanwhile, the Customs Service's 21 international mail branches
in fiscal 1988 seized record quantities of other drugs _ heroin,
opium and marijuana, Shimkoski said.
   Those branches seized 164 pounds of heroin, compared with just 23
pounds in fiscal 1987, he said. Meanwhile, opium seizures increased
from 1,019 pounds to 1,600 pounds, and marijuana seizures increased
from 1,141 to 1,310 pounds. There were no significant amounts of
cocaine mailed, he said.
   To increase such seizures in the future, the Customs Service is
cooperating with the Postal Service on a program in which mail from
29 high-risk drug sources countries would be cleared at the port of
arrival.
   ``This will prevent ground transfers to inland destinations,
eliminates potential monkey business'' that could occur if the bags
were not checked immediately, Shimkoski said.

   An interagency intelligence panel in the Bush
administration could determine whether additional criminal charges
are dropped against fired National Security aide Oliver L. North.
   The group began its review after U.S. District Judge Gerhard
Gesell issued a sealed order last Thursday detailing how much
classified information must be disclosed by the defense in order for
North to get a fair trial.
   No final decisions have been made, sources familiar with the
process said Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   An earlier review by the interagency group led to dismissal of
conspiracy and theft charges against North in the closing weeks of
the Reagan administration. That review was of documents prosecutors
planned to use against North.
   The interagency group concluded in that earlier review that due
to national security concerns it would not declassify much of the
material which Gesell ordered must be disclosed at trial. Gesell
declined to reconsider his decision requiring extensive disclosure
and as a result, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh sought dismissal
of the conspiracy and theft charges.
   The detail Gesell said must be disclosed after that earlier
review included verbatim texts of various intelligence reports and
the names of five Central American countries and Israel. Foreign
leaders were to be identified by relative rank and field of
activity, though not be name.
   Gesell has limited the defense to presenting 300 classified
documents, the same number that would be presented by Walsh's office
to prosecute North in the Iran-Contra case.
   Twelve criminal charges remain against North.
   Nine of the 12 counts focus on North's efforts to conceal from
Congress and former Attorney General Edwin Meese III his efforts on
behalf of the Contras fighting the leftist government of Nicaragua.
Four of the nine counts deal with alleged concealment of the
diversion of money to the Contras from the administration's secret
arms sales to Iran.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in travelers checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.
   The conspiracy and theft counts that were dropped accused North
of illegally diverting to the Contras more than $14 million in
proceeds from the Reagan administration's arms sales to Iran.

   On his first full working day, President Bush
met with Vice President Dan Quayle, gave a pep talk to his senior
staff, phoned Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and addressed anti-abortion
activists.
   That was all before lunch.
   By the end of the afternoon, Bush also had visited Quayle at the
vice president's desk in the Old Executive Office Building next to
the White House, presided over the first meeting of his Cabinet and
attended to routine paperwork in the Oval Office.
   By the time, he finished his day's work, Bush had put in 11 hours
and 16 minutes.
   If Monday is any indication, Bush will start work earlier than
Ronald Reagan did, and likely stay later in the Oval Office each
day. Reagan usually worked from around 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
   Here is how the president's day went, according to his public
schedule and conversations with White House officials:
   _7:21 a.m. Bush has breakfast in the Oval Office with Quayle.
John Sununu passes through and Quayle administers the oath of office
to the chief of staff. (An account of Quayle's day by press
secretary Dave Beckwith says breakfast was at 7:15 a.m.)
   _8:00 a.m. Bush gets a briefing from CIA officials.
   ``The CIA briefing is a daily intelligence briefing that they
gave to President Bush during his years as vice president, and it is
their intelligence assessment of the world situation that day,''
said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. President Reagan did not have
daily CIA briefings.
   _8:20 a.m. Bush attends formal swearing-in of his senior staff in
the East Room.
   He tells aides that ``we all now are about to embark on a really
great adventure.'' Bush says the work will be arduous, but that
``these long hours can result in a country with more opportunity for
all.''
   _9:00 a.m. Bush meets with national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft in the Oval Office.
   Fitzwater said Scowcroft's briefing is broader in scope than that
provided by the CIA. In his role as coordinator of foreign policy
matters in the White House, ``he presents the presidents with the
views of all the foreign policy agencies on various issues facing
the president,'' the spokesman says.
   _12:10 p.m.: Bush talks by telephone to leaders of the
anti-abortion demonstration in the capital city, where the focus is
reversal of the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion on
demand.
   ``I'm confident that more and more Americans every year _ every
day _ are hearing your message and taking it to heart,'' he tells
the activists.
   _12:15 p.m.: Bush has lunch with his senior staff in the
Roosevelt Room. He also has telephone conversations with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, among others, to
thank them for their good wishes.
   _1:30 p.m.: Bush drops by Quayle's office in the Old Executive
Office Building. The president watched as Quayle was photographed
signing his name in the historic vice presidential desk that Bush
also used as vice president and that he and predecessors had signed.
   _2:15 p.m.: Bush attends meeting of his Cabinet and mostly
listens as Sununu discusses with the president's new team ``an
overview of major themes and initiatives to be taken in the weeks
ahead.'' Sununu does most of the talking after Bush introduces the
agenda.
   _4:45 p.m.: Bush has staff time, attends to routine paperwork in
the Oval Office.
   _6:37 p.m.: Bush returns to the White House residence for dinner.

   Public school officials abandoned a trend-setting
program offering overnight shelter to homeless students after a
trial run at two inner-city schools drew no more than eight
youngsters a night.
   Superintendent Joan Raymond told school board members she now
wants to keep the two campuses open until 10 p.m. each night in an
effort to attract children living on the streets and refer those
needing help to the proper social agencies.
   ``If the need had been there, if we had discovered that these
kids would come only to the schoolhouse, then I would have come to a
different decision,'' Ms. Raymond said Friday. ``But I think it
would take a very, very long time before a shelter could be
established as an institution.''
   The Schoolhouse Shelters program, which operated for eight
nights, was based on the premise that homeless children who feared
seeking help through traditional agencies may turn to a more
familiar environment for assistance.
   Two schools, one for high school students and the other for
younger children, were available with food and overnight
accommodations under the plan, which was staffed beginning Jan. 12
by volunteers at a minimal cost to the district, officials said.

<HEAD>Congressional Report Suggests Fees on Coastal Polluters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study by two congressional subcommittees
recommends imposing fees on companies that dump toxic wastes and
other pollutants into the nation's coastal waters.
   A fee system would ``create powerful economic incentives'' for
companies to reduce the amount of wastes dumped into oceans, bays
and estuaries while raising money to pay for new environmental
programs, according to the report released Monday.
   The fees would be imposed on companies that are meeting federal
regulatory standards, which allow some dumping. Companies found to
be illegally dumping toxic wastes and other pollutants already are
subject to criminal penalties, including fines.
   The 48-page report, released by Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass.,
stems from nine hearings held during the past two years by the House
Merchant Marine and Fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and the
environment, headed by Studds, and the oceanography subcommittee.
   The panels painted a bleak picture of the state of the nation's
coastal waters.
   ``The continuing damage to coastal resources from pollution,
development and natural forces raises serious doubts about the
ability of our estuaries, bays and near coastal waters to survive
these stresses,'' the subcommittees wrote.
   ``If we fail to act and if current trends continue unabated, what
is now a serious, widespread collection of problems may coalesce
into a national crisis by early in the next century.''
   The subcommittees warned against ``quick fixes'' and noted that
installing ``an effective and fair fee system'' would be difficult.
They did not offer specifics.
   ``Many variations and alternatives should be examined. But the
twin imperatives of increasing funds for pollution control and
decreasing wastes justify the effort,'' the report said.
   The study said spending for marine research and monitoring
decreased during the Reagan administration from a 1981 level of more
than $150 million to about $110 million last year.
   ``For the past eight years we have tried to defend past
accomplishments against the encroachments of a hostile
administration,'' Studds said. ``Today, we have ... a president who
campaigned from Boston Harbor to the Jersey Shore to Santa Barbara
as an environmentalist. And we have both the opportunity, and an
urgent national need, to reverse the tide of coastal degradation and
move forward once again.''
   The subcommittees recommended development of a national coastal
protection policy, increased funding levels, stricter pollution
enforcement efforts and new incentives for voluntary compliance.

<HEAD>Reputed Mob Leader Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Gotti, the reputed head of the Gambino
organized-crime family, and two of his associates were arrested
Monday night on charges they had ordered a union leader shot three
years ago.
   Gotti was arrested while walking with his bodyguard in
Manhattan's Little Italy section about 5:30 p.m. and charged with
first-degree assault and conspiracy, said District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau.
   Gotti was arraigned before Manhattan Criminal Court Judge
Patricia Williams, who ordered him held without bail.
   An indictment by a grand jury was expected to be unsealed Tuesday.
   The other defendants arrested on the same charges were Angelo
Ruggiero and Anthony Guerrieri.
   The FBI has identified Ruggiero, 48, as a captain in the Gambino
group and Guerrieri, 60, as a ``soldier.''
   The FBI and other New York state law enforcement officials have
said that Gotti, 48, heads the Gambino family syndicate, which is
believed to be the largest and most powerful organized crime group
in the country.
   Assistant District Attorney Michael Cherkasky declined to comment
on the charges. But sources said the sealed indictment involves the
shooting on May 7, 1986, of John O'Connor, vice president and
business manager of Carpenters Union Local 608.
   O'Connor was shot several times in the buttocks in what
investigators said was retaliation for his having ordered vandalism
in 1986 at a restaurant using non-union carpenters. O'Connor
apparently was unaware that the owners were friends of Gotti.
   Morgenthau's office said law enforcement officials overheard
Gotti, via a court-ordered listening device, talk about killing a
union leader shortly before O'Connor was wounded.
   The contract for killing O'Connor allegedly was given to James
Coonan, the reputed leader of the Westies, a gang that operated on
Manhattan's West Side. Some of the gang members are expected to be
named in the indictment.

<HEAD>Guerrillas, in Major Shift, Offer to Back Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a major policy shift, leftist
rebels have offered to participate in and respect the outcome of
national elections if the U.S.-backed government meets their
conditions.
   The proposal from the guerrillas who have waged war against the
government for nine years comes in a document, obtained by The
Associated Press on Monday, signed by the five senior rebel leaders.
   The document was to be made public today at a Mexico City news
conference.
   Rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front have
contended that all five elections held this decade were maneuvers of
the ``U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency project.'' They say that
despite a civil administration, the armed forces are still the most
powerful element of government.
   The insurgents say the elections, scheduled for March 19, must be
put off until Sept. 15 if they are to participate.
   The right-wing Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena,
virtually rejected the guerrilla proposal before it was made public.
Arena controls the legislature and is leading in presidential polls.
   Armando Calderon Sol, mayor of San Salvador and a top Arena
leader, told journalists: ``This is typical of the subversion. They
attack mercilessly, kill, assassinate, strike, then come along and
say, okay, now we offer negotiations.''
   Rene Roldan, vice-presidential candidate of the leftist
Democratic Convergence, said his party endorsed the proposal. ``It
hopes to advance the peace process.''
   The Christian Democratic government of President Jose Napoleon
Duarte had no immediate comment.
   The document says the war's recent escalation ``places before the
armed forces the dilemma of having to carry out genocide and thus
provoke insurrection or wait for governmental power to disintegrate
completely and face insurrection caused by hunger.''
   The guerrilla force is estimated at about 7,000 combatants and up
to 15,000 militiamen and women. Rebels move freely through and
exercise some governmental functions in about one-sixth of the
country.
   Last year, rebels increasingly brought a predominantly rural war
to the capital with attacks on major military bases in the city.
They also resorted to the use of car bombs and the assassination of
mayors.
   The government says those ``terroristic'' tactics demonstrate the
rebels' relative weakness. Yet 56,000-man army has been unable to
defeat the rebels _ despite about $800 million in military aid
received since 1981 and considerable air power, which the guerrillas
lack.
   Most military observers say the rebels have almost no chance of
defeating government forces, and the new proposal may be recognition
that the military path to power is not viable.
   In the document, the rebels acknowledge ``the existence of an
international situation in which the majority of wars are being
resolved by means of negotiation.''
   Expressing a willingness to respect the elections' outcome, they
effectively dropped their long-standing demand that they share power
in a transitional administration that would pave the way for popular
government.
   The insurgents set the following conditions, besides postponement:
   _A halt to what they call the armed forces' ``repression'' of
labor and campesino leaders and of street demonstrations.
   _The confinement of military and police personnel to barracks on
election day.
   _The awarding of a Central Elections Council seat to the
Democratic Convergence and formation of a watchdog panel to
guarantee clean elections.
   _Revision of the current electoral code through negotiations
among all parties.
   _Respect for absentee ballots cast by Salvadorans who left the
country during the war.
   _The United States cannot interfere in the electoral process or
give aid to any party.
   The guerrilla army, in turn, would promise to:
   _Respect political activity of all parties and government
election authorities.
   _Respect the lives of mayors, unless they perform
military-related functions.
   _Observe a truce beginning two days before elections and ending
two days after.
   _Fully participate in the campaign and election activity. The
rebels have boycotted and tried to sabotage previous elections. They
endorse candidates of the Democratic Convergence, whose leaders
maintain links to the rebel army.
   _``The FMLN would accept the legitimacy of the the electoral
result,'' the document says, and respect the continuation of the
present Christian Democratic government until the elections.
   Duarte met with the country's Roman Catholic leder, Archbishop
Arturo Rivera Damas, on Monday to disucuss the guerrilla document.
The rebels gave Rivera Damas the proposal on Friday in Mexico City.
   In the document, the rebels call for ``immediate'' discussions
with the government on the proposal and say the archbishop ``can
contribute to the arrangement of these conversations.''
   The document does not mention a halt to fighting other than the
five-day election truce and it was not clear how they think
legitimate elections can be staged if fighting continues up to
election day.
   The war has killed an estimated 65,000 people, mostly civilians.
Politically motivated slayings of civilians by government forces,
rightist death squads and the guerrillas rose sharply in 1988 over
the previous year.
   Arena trounced incumbents in legislative and municipal elections
last March, and has led the Christian Democrats in recent polls.
   Three rounds of guerrilla-government peace talks between 1984 and
1987 ended in stalemate. The government last year rejected at least
two guerrilla proposals to resume negotiations.

<HEAD>Supermarket Salad Bars no Bargain, USDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supermarket salad bars are growing in
popularity, but an Agriculture Department nutritionist says they
also can be more expensive than tossing something together at home.
   Eileen P. Newman of the department's Human Nutrition Information
Service said Monday that a study showed the costs per pound for many
common salad ingredients were significantly higher at salad bars
than the same items bought elsewhere in the store.
   The study of 55 prepared items showed that consumers ``may want
to weigh the cost of salad bar purchases against preparing the items
at home,'' Newman said.
   ``It shows, for example, that many common salad ingredients,
including cucumbers, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, spinach and green
peppers, cost from two to four times more at salad bars,'' she said.
   But there were also bargains. The per-pound prices of items of
animal origin, such as cheese, ham and tuna, were actually less at
the salad bars.
   The price information was collected in the Washington, D.C.,
metropolitan area last July.

   Dan Quayle is starting his tenure as vice
president with a high public profile, meeting five times with
President Bush on his first workday and representing the
administration in a session with anti-abortion leaders.
   Quayle's schedule today called for him to participate in Bush's
morning meeting with leaders of Congress on the thorny federal
deficit issue and on Bush's plea for a bipartisan foreign policy.
   Then Quayle was to go to Capitol Hill and meet individually with
the leaders in their offices _ Senate Republican leader Bob Dole,
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, House Republican Leader Bob
Michel, House Speaker Jim Wright and House Majority Leader Tom Foley.
   Quayle was on the list to attend a dinner tonight at the White
House hosted by President Bush for United Nations Secretary General
Javier Perez De Cuellar.
   Quayle's schedule was apparently designed to ensure there's no
impression the Bush camp wants him out of sight in light of the
negative publicity that dogged him during the campaign, and the
subsequent low profile he kept in the weeks between the election and
the inaguration last week.
   On Monday, two of the Bush-Quayle meetings were private _ one for
breakfast at 7:15 a.m. and another late in the afternoon on an
unspecified topic. Another was in Bush's meeting with the entire
Cabinet and another was a 10-minute photo session during which
Quayle signed his name in the drawer of a historic vice presidential
desk that had also been signed by Bush and other predecessors.
   In addition, Quayle at Bush's request swore in several White
House staff members in a session attended by Bush.
   Quayle's schedule on his first day as vice president, as relayed
by press secretary Dave Beckwith, ran as follows:
   _6:40 a.m. EST. Left residence in McLean, Va., where he and his
family are staying while the official vice presidential mansion in
Washington is being remodeled.
   _7:10 a.m. Arrived White House.
   _7:15 a.m. Breakfast with Bush.
   _8 a.m. Routine intelligence briefing for vice president by CIA
staff.
   _8:20 a.m. Swearing in of some 65 White House staff members in a
session attended by Bush and his Chief of Staff John Sununu.
   _10 a.m. Meeting with vice presidential Chief of Staff Robert
Guttman, Beckwith, domestic policy adviser Bill Kristol and
legislative liaison Bill Gribbin. Discussion focused mostly on
upcoming meeting with anti-abortion leaders.
   _10:30 a.m. Meeting with anti-abortion leaders, in Washington for
annual demonstration on anniversary of Roe V. Wade Supreme Court
decision legalizing abortion. Quayle told the group the
administration shares their desire to overturn the decision. Sununu
also attended the meeting.
   _11:15 a.m. Meeting with six senior vice presidential staff
members.
   _12:15 p.m. Lunch in White House mess with Beckwith, Guttman and
Kristol.
   _1:30 p.m. Photo session while signing name in drawer of historic
vice presidential desk in Old Executive Office Building office,
while Bush looked on.
   _2:15 p.m. Cabinet meeting in White House.
   _3:30 p.m. Meeting with Secretary of State-designate James Baker
and White House national security adviser Brent Scowcroft in
Quayle's office. The meeting concerned Latin American problems, an
administration source said.
   _5:30 p.m. Interview with British TV crew that is doing a
documentary on Quayle and his family.
   _6:15 p.m. Meeting with Chief of Staff Guttman and Carnes Lord,
national security adviser to the vice president.
   _6:45 p.m. Went home for the day.

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen Tuesday,
while share prices rose sharply on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, hitting
another new high.
   The dollar closed at 126.95 yen, down 1.25 yen from the previous
day's 128.20 yen finish. The currency opened at 127.37 yen and
ranged between 126.70 and 127.55 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
162.50 points Monday, added another 224.80 points, or 0.72 percent,
closing at 31,557.68, a new high.
   Declining U.S. oil prices helped to raise the ``confidence of
investors'' who have been more concerned about oil prices than
exchange rates recently, said Seichiro Kita of Daiwa Securities, a
major Japanese brokerage.
   U.S. spot crude oil prices finished sharply lower Monday in what
appeared to be a long-awaited technical correction from the gains of
the last six weeks, with February contracts for West Texas
Intermediate crude oil ending at $17.70 a barrel, down $1.15 a
barrel from Friday.

   Former Rep. Michael Barnes of Maryland endorsed
Ron Brown for the chairmanship of the Democratic Party after
abandoning his own bid for the post.
   Barnes' departure Monday left four candidates vying to succeed
Paul G. Kirk Jr. as party chairman: Brown, a former party official
who played a key role in Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign;
Michigan party chairman Richard Wiener; and former Reps. Jim Jones
of Oklahoma and James Stanton of Ohio.
   ``I believe that party unity will be best served if we can unite
behind Ron, a man of proven ability, who has served in numerous
important capacities in our party, including deputy chair,'' said
Barnes.
   As Jackson's convention manager last year, Brown received a share
of the credit for the show of unity between Jackson and presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis at the Democrats' national convention.

   Government regulators are routinely allowing
discrimination in home mortgage lending against blacks and Hispanics
seeking to buy homes, two congressmen charged.
   ``It is inexcusable for the responsible agencies to be ignorant
of the rates of rejections for black and Hispanic home buyers,''
Rep. Joseph Kennedy II, D-Mass., said Monday. ``Now that the
evidence is before them, it is their duty to act decisively.''
   Kennedy and House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez,
D-Texas, pointed to data from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution under the Freedom of
Information Act and published in Sunday's editions.
   Statistics from 10 million loan applications from 1983 to
mid-1988 showed the rate of rejection for white applicants at the
3,100 savings and loans nationwide was 11.1 percent, while the
rejection rate for blacks was 23.7 percent and 18.2 percent for
Hispanics.

   The eastern weather satellite that provides
cloud pictures seen in newspapers and on television is being shifted
westward to help cover ground that had been covered by a satellite
that died from old age.
   The loss of GOES-West on Saturday leaves the nation with just one
stationary weather satellite. Another one is not due to be launched
for at least 18 months.
   Thomas M. Pyke Jr., head of satellite services at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the loss leaves
meteorologists will have ``only limited coverage of Atlantic and
Pacific ocean areas where these severe storms originate.''
   The nation operated with only a western satellite from 1984 until
March 1987 because of the failure of an old eastern satellite.

<HEAD>Relatives Of Comic Strip Creator Plan To Bring Back Buck Rogers</HEAD>

   An elevator that goes through the roof and into
outer space? Colonies orbiting Earth? A giant hook that swings from
the sky and scoops goods and passengers into space?
   Impossible!
   Then again ...
   Sixty years ago, men walking on the moon, lie detectors and
instant cameras sounded equally implausible to most people.
   The 1929 predictions, and many more like them, were made in the
comic strip ``Buck Rogers,'' set in the year 2429. On Monday, the
grandchildren of one of the cartoon's creators gathered to make new
predictions on what would have been Buck's 60th anniversary.
   ``In 1929, when they came out with the numerous predictions in
Buck Rogers, they thought they were 500 years in the future. And
(much of it) came true within a century,'' said Flint Dille,
grandson of John Flint Dille, who died in 1957.
   Dille and his sister, Lorraine Williams, plan to bring back the
strip as well as release a series of books and possibly a movie.
   But first, they said, they must revamp the future since much of
their grandfather's future has already become reality.
   So, like their grandfather, the pair assembled a team including
scientists and artists to create a world in which to set the
stories. They talked about the future at the Henry Crown Space
Center of the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry.
   They devised the space elevator, which is a tube that rises from
Earth into the outer atmosphere; the sky hook, which would scoop
cargo into space; an environmental suit that would adapt itself to
any atmosphere; and energy guns that would replace pistols.
   ``It's a classic adventure set in the plausible future,'' Dille
said. ``This is all a logical extension of what we have now. ...
Everything in the story has to be something that with present
theories of science could be done.''
   In 1929, John Flint Dille, president of the National News
Syndicate, created the strip with artist Dick Calkins and writer
Philip Nowlan. The three, with a team of experts, developed an image
of the future, including rockets and nuclear energy.
   The comic strip was canceled in 1967, a victim of the present
catching up with the future. The future looked gloomy, Ms. Williams
said, with the possibility of nuclear destruction and global war.
   But since then, young people are more interested in the future
and are not intimidated by the possibilities, she said.
   That makes 1989 the right time to bring Buck Rogers into the 25th
century, though such plans are only in their nascent stages, she
said.
   ``The future now is positive and it's exciting,'' Ms. Williams
said. ``And that's why Buck will be successful.''

   Has Broadway gone punk?
   Not yet, anyway, but theatergoers may begin to wonder when they
spot the new poster for the hit musical ``Les Miserables'' _ the one
in which the orphaned waif Cosette is sporting a Mohawk haircut.
   Pitiable at the best of times, the poor child looks utterly
pathetic with a single sheaf of hair sprouting out of a bald,
rounded head. What's going on here?
   As it turns out, little Cosette is being used to make a point
about ticket scalpers who have been preying on customers eager to
see the Tony Award-winning show.
   ``Don't Get Scalped,'' reads the headline on the poster. ``We may
have seats for today's performance.''
   ``The show has been selling out,'' producer Cameron Mackintosh
explained Monday, ``but at this time of year we do have some tickets
available a few days before. And even on the day of performance we
have $16 student tickets or sometimes $25 ticket in the rear
mezzanine.''
   Many people are apparently convinced that the scalpers' tickets
are the only ones available. Mackintosh said he's heard of
theatergoers shelling out as much as $150 a ticket for ``Les
Miserables,'' losing their shirts if not their hair.

   Police said the celebration went well, without the broken

Super Bowl victories in 1982 and 1985.
   But some fans were disappointed when the team, at the behest of
police, quickly boarded a bus and left for an undisclosed location

   ``They should have controlled the celebration, not abandoned

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II and the U.S. Catholic hierarchy, who sparred
over the issue of church dissent during the pontiff's visit to Los
Angeles in 1987, will tackle the volatile issue of U.S.-Vatican
relations in a March meeting in Rome.
   More than 30 U.S. bishops and two Eastern Rite metropolitans have
been invited to the March 8-11 meeting, which follows a year of
private discussions with U.S. bishops, the United States Catholic
Conference announced Monday.
   ``It was a good start in Los Angeles, and now we hope to make it
a little more in-depth,'' said Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis,
president of the National Conference of Catholic bishops. ``He is
very strong for the meeting. He wants to have it.''
   When the two sides last met in September 1987, the pope
challenged American bishops to crack down on dissenters from church
teaching, while the U.S. bishops told the pontiff an authoritarian
approach alienates many of the country's 53 million Catholics.
   In his talk, the pope decried reports that many Catholics veer
from official teaching on issues such as sexual morality and divorce.
   ``It is sometimes claimed that dissent from the Magisterium is
totally compatible with being a `good Catholic' and poses no
obstacle to the reception of the sacraments. This is a grave error
that challenges the teaching office of the bishops of the United
States and elsewhere,'' the pope said.
   But Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee told the pope
that in the United States, ``The faithful are more inclined to look
at the intrinsic worth of an argument proposed by the teachers in
the church than to accept it on the basis of the authority itself.''
In many cases, he said, ``an authoritarian style is
counterproductive, and such authority for the most part then becomes
ignored.''
   Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco said he recognized the
pope's concerns, but ``we cannot fulfill our task simply by an
uncritical application of solutions designed in past ages for
problems which have qualitatively changed or which did not exist in
the past.''
   The state of U.S.-Vatican relations had fallen to the point in
November 1986 that Bishop James Malone, then-president of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, called for a meeting
between U.S. leaders and the Vatican to discuss the ``growing and
dangerous disaffection'' of American Catholics from the Holy See.
   In his letter this month to U.S. bishops, the pope said he was
aware of their ``keen interest'' in meeting with him as a group.
   The letter did not set a specific agenda, but said the theme of
the meeting would be ``evangelization in the context of the culture
and society of the United States, with particular emphasis on the
role of the bishop as the teacher of faith.''
   May said in a telephone interview that the topic will be similar
to the issues raised in Los Angeles in 1987, but ``that was just a
beginning.''
   He said the climate of U.S.-Vatican relations has changed since
Malone made his appeal at the bishops' meeting following the papal
visit.
   For example, he said, Seattle Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen, who
had been unilaterally stripped of some of his authority by the
Vatican for alleged abuses, has regained effective control of the
archdiocese and is the one delegates to the papal meeting in March.
   ``I personally think that things are much more even right now and
much more peaceful than at the time Bishop Malone made his
suggestion,'' Archbishop May said. ``I think things are on a nice,
even keel.''
   Archbishop May also noted that the pope has largely praised the
U.S. church during the bishops' private meetings with the pope
throughout last year. The meetings were part of the required ``ad
limina'' visits all episcopal leaders must make to Rome every five
years.
   He said the pontiff ``paid tribute'' to Mass attendance in the
United States, the schools and social service programs run by the
church and the bishops' pastoral letters on peace and the economy.
Among the problems cited by the pope during the ``ad limina'' visits
were a lack of appreciation of penance, inappropriate use of
eucharistic ministers to give communion and a need to recruit more
vocations, May said.
   The U.S. delegation also plans to make its own points in Rome,
May said.
   ``We do believe that it will be helpful for the holy father as
well to know more about the culture and society where we work,'' May
said.

<HEAD>Officer Charged With Manslaughter; Lawyer Calls It Whitewash</HEAD>

   Two manslaughter counts have been filed against a
policeman whose fatal shooting of a black man ignited last week's
racial riots, but a lawyer for one of the victims said the charges
amount to a ``whitewash.''
   Officer William Lozano, 29, was charged Monday, hours after the
funeral for 23-year-old Clement Lloyd, who was shot to death on his
motorcycle while being pursued by another officer for speeding.
Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, died from injuries sustained
when the motorcycle crashed in the Overtown section.
   The Hispanic officer, who has been suspended with pay since the
shooting on the holiday for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,
surrended Monday at Dade County Jail and left 30 minutes later after
posting $10,000 bond, said John Hogan, chief assistant Dade County
state attorney.
   Also Monday, a special city panel reviewing the killings
complained it lacked sufficient investigatory powers, and the U.S.
Justice Department said it sent two prosecutors to Miami to
investigate.
   A government source in Washington, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said a grand jury could be impaneled as early as this
week to study possible federal charges against Lozano.
   Lozano could face 60 years in prison and a $30,000 fine if
convicted of the charges _ manslaughter with a firearm, said State
Attorney Janet Reno.
   She said a thorough investigation found that murder charges were
unwarranted.
   ``Based on the evidence and applicable Florida law, manslaughter
is the correct charge,'' she said.
   But Ellis Rubin, an attorney for Blanchard's family, said his
clients were dismayed that Lozano wasn't charged with second-degree
murder, which indicates malice was present in the attack and carries
a possible life prison sentence.
   ``This practically amounts to a whitewash and we're very
disappointed,'' Rubin said. ``We're going to monitor this case very
closely.''
   Ms. Reno also was criticized by Lozano's attorney, Roy Black, who
said the officer acted in self-defense and was being made a
scapegoat for political reasons.
   Lozano was issuing a traffic ticket when he saw the motorcycle
speeding toward him, authorities said.
   According to Lozano's arrest warrant, a witness told
investigators Lozano was standing in the lane opposite the
motorcycle and stepped toward it before firing. The witness, Eddie
Johnson, claimed Lozano did not try to get out of the way.
   Lloyd was shot once in the head. The killing triggered three days
of looting and violence in the predominantly black Overtown and
Liberty City sections that left one man dead and 11 others wounded
by gunfire. Fire officials estimated $1 million in damage from arson
and looting.
   While black leaders praised Lozano's arrest, they remained
skeptical that the Colombian-born officer would be convicted.
   ``The community will feel the right action was taken,'' said
Dewey W. Knight Jr., former deputy county manager. ``But the
community is apprehensive to see what will happen in the criminal
justice system. We've been this route before. The question is
whether justice will be done and done totally.''
   The special 11-member city panel of police officers and civilians
reviewing the shooting complained it lacked sufficient clout.
   ``The limitations to subpoena powers give this panel ... really,
it's just a sham,'' said the Rev. Richard Barry, the panel's
chairman, after City Attorney Jorge Fernandez told them witnesses
they subpoena are not legally obligated to talk to them.
   The board is to issue a preliminary report to the city commission
Thursday. Members said they want to look more broadly at underlying
social problems in the black community.
   Only hours before Lozano's arrest, about 150 relatives and
friends of Lloyd gathered for his funeral at the small Bahman Avenue
Church of God in Opa-locka.
   Lloyd's mother and other family members, most immigrants from the
Virgin Islands, wept and cried out as mourners sang ``Rock of Ages.''
   ``As Martin Luther King said, we live together as rational human
beings or die together as fools _ not only in Miami but all over
America,'' said the Rev. Morris Lloyd, Lloyd's uncle. ``Until
something is done to correct our injustices, I believe a lot more
lives are going to be lost.''

<HEAD>5,000 Cambodian Refugees Evacuated From Border Shelling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy shelling from inside Cambodia
forced about 5,000 Cambodian refugees to evacuate a Khmer Rouge-run
camp to areas deeper into Thailand, a Thai official said today.
   The refugees fleeing the bombardment _ mostly women and children
_ retreated Thursday and Friday about one-third of a mile from their
camp in Thailand's eastern Trat province, said the official, who
requested anonymity.
   The Borai camp is about 2{ miles from the Cambodian border.
   The official gave no report of casualties from the bombardment,
which ended Saturday.
   Gunners fired 30 mortar and artillery rounds in the attacks, the
official said. The shelling is believed to have come from Vietnamese
forces or those of Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government.
   The refugees will return to the camp they fled when authorities
have determined the camp is ``again safe to re-enter and live,'' the
official said in a telephone interview.
   Military officials told a news conference Monday that 170
artillery rounds crashed into the area near the camp during the
month that ended Monday, but said fighting along the border was less
intense compared to previous months.
   Thai military officers previously said Vietnam has withdrawn some
troops 19 miles from the border area to ease tensions. On Monday,
however, a military spokesman, Lt. Gen. Naruedol Dejpradiyuth,
denied such a report, saying Vietnamese troops ``are now deployed
along the entire border.''
   Sustained shelling along the border in November forced about
5,000 Cambodians back to a U.N.-aided camp from which they had been
forcibly moved by communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who apparently
tried to populate areas just inside Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge, which ruled from 1975 until Vietnam invaded in
late 1978, is the largest guerrilla group fighting the Vietnamese in
Cambodia. During its rule, it is estimated that about 2 million of
Cambodia's 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge executions, famine
and civil unrest.

   A man with a history of mental problems
wounded two co-workers at a car dealership when he opened fire with
an AK-47 assault rifle on customers and employees before killing
himself, police said.
   The body of Willie Howard Womack Jr., 26, of Virginia Beach, was
found Monday in the office of a service garage at Kimnach Ford. Near
his body was the rifle and a derringer, said police Cpl. Robert P.
Haynes.
   Heavily armed police had surrounded the garage and tried to
contact Womack for more than six hours before they lobbed tear gas
canisters into the building and went inside.
   Womack's sister, Angela, had tried to contact her brother over an
intercom after police efforts to reach him by telephone and bullhorn
failed. But he apparently had been dead during what police thought
was a standoff, said Haynes.
   Womack, who cleaned cars and ran errands at the dealership, had
been at work for a while before the shooting broke out, Haynes said.
   ``One of his co-workers said he came into work as happy as
ever,'' he said. Police disclosed no motive for the shootings.
   ``He said everybody at work had been picking on him lately,''
said Womack's mother, Nancy Condrey. She said her son had some
previous mental problems, had sought professional help and been on
medication.
   Wounded in the assault were Barry Graham, 32, and William
Bidlack, 33. Graham was hospitalized in serious but stable condition
with a wound in the leg and Bidlack was in satisfactory condition
with a hand wound. Both worked in the body shop.
   The service garage and several cars in the parking lot were
riddled with bullets.
   Dealership owner Peggy Kimnach said Womack had worked there for
five years and was a ``good employee.''
   A mechanic, Wayne Gravitt, described Womack as quiet. ``Nobody
really knows him,'' he said.
   ``We was very flaky, but we never thought he was dangerous. In
fact, we felt kind of sorry for him,'' said Leo Shelor, another
mechanic.
   Donna Morris, 26, of Virginia Beach, had left her car for
servicing and was waiting outside for a taxi when the shooting began.
   ``It sounded like firecrackers,'' she said. ``All of a sudden the
service doors opened and everybody just came piling out.''
   A female employee told her to run because ``somebody had gone
berserk in there with a gun.''
   Monday's shooting was the nation's second in a week involving an
AK-47. On Jan. 17, 24-year-old Patrick Edward Purdy fired more than
100 rounds from an AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifle outside the
grade school he once attended in Stockton, Calif., killing five
children and wounding 29 others and a teacher before killing himself.

<HEAD>Mine Collapse Kills Three, Traps Up To 300</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Thirty rescuers today searched a gold mine in
southern Peru for survivors of a fire and cave-in that killed three
miners and trapped up to 300 for more than three days, officials
said.
   Police Lt. Juan Robles said noxious gas and heavy smoke was
hampering efforts to find the miners, who he feared had succumbed to
the gases.
   The miners had been trapped in the hillside mine since a fire
broke out Saturday, and the collapse Monday morning further
complicated rescue efforts.
   Robles said the 150 to 300 miners were trapped at the
privately-owned Sol de Oro gold mine near Nazca, on the Pacific
coast 230 miles south of Lima.
   ``We believe that there are miners trapped in the second, third
and fourth levels'' of the five-level mine, he said.
   Lima's Civil Defense office said official spokesmen were
unavailable and that it had no information on the cave-in.
   Robles said in a telephone interview from Nazca that a 30-man
team was conducting rescue operations and had recovered three bodies.
   He said the mine tunnels gave way after a fire sparked by gas
lamps destroyed supporting beams on the mine's second level.
   The fire began on the first and second levels Friday, but was
controlled by miners, said Robles. It flared again on Saturday,
preventing the miners from escaping.
   The official said more than 900 miners work at the mine, but many
have the weekend off. The exact number in the mine at the time of
collapse was not known.
   Robles said a portion of the mine was taken over by workers a
year ago under a law permitting workers in small mining operations
to own shares of private mines.
   Mining is Peru's most important industry and accounts for more
than half of its foreign exchange. Gold is the nation's fifth
leading mineral behind copper, silver, lead and zinc.

Iranian officials in Damascus to seek an end to the bloodshed.
   Police said four people were killed and 14 wounded in the
fighting between the Syrian-backed Amal militia and the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   That raised the casualty toll since the latest spasm of violence
erupted Dec. 31 to at least 172 killed and 332 wounded.
   The fighting began with artillery exchanges late Monday,
shattering a four-day cease-fire. It centered on Hezbollah's
stronghold on the western edge of Israel's self-designated
``security zone.''
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said both sides launched attacks against each others'
positions, but neither gained any territory.
   The fighting died down into intermittent mortar exchanges around
daybreak.
   Amal said in a statement that Hezbollah fighters started the
fighting by attacking its positions in the hamlets of Kfar Filla and
Jarjoua. The towns are west and southwest of the triangular-shaped
mountain enclave controlled by the Iranian-backed militia.
   ``The Hezbollah attacks were repulsed,'' the Amal statement said.
It gave no other details.
   Hezbollah accused Amal of attacking its fighters in the villages
of Jbaa and Ein Bouswar in an attempt to sabotage efforts by Iran
and Syria to end the nine-month confrontation between their unruly
Lebanese surrogates.
   By police count, more than 500 people have been killed and 1,500
wounded since April in battles between the two factions for control
of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   A Hezbollah communique said the Amal assaults were ``crushed and
the attackers pushed back.''
   The statement warned Amal against ``maintaining a hostile
attitude and blocking efforts to achieve a comprehensive political
settlement.''
   In the Syrian capital, Syrian and Iranian envoys worked today on
achieving a peace formula acceptable to their proxies.
   Syria's Foreign Minister, Farouk Sharaa and his Iranian
counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, held a series of meetings Monday
with Amal leader Nabih Berri and Hezbollah representatives Sheik
Ibrahim Amin and Hussein Musavi.
   Berri told reporters Amal will not agree to a settlement until
Hezbollah hands over the assassins of three Amal commanders.
   Amal has accused Hezbollah of killing Daoud Daoud, its leader in
south Lebanon, and two senior lieutenants in a street ambush in
south Beirut on Sept. 22. Hezbollah denies involvement.
   The Iranian-backed fundamentalists advocate the creation of an
Iranian-style Islamic republic in Lebanon. The more secular and
nationalist Amal seeks a government in Lebanon in which Moslems
would have an equal share of power with the once dominant Christians.
   The Shiite battles have strained the relations between Iran and
Syria, Tehran's main Arab ally in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war
with Iraq that an Aug. 20 cease-fire brought to a halt.

<HEAD>Snow Spreads From Northern Rockies To Plains; East, South Unseasonably
Warm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow spread from the northern Rockies to the Plains today,
Southern California got rain and snow, but the East and much of the
South had unseasonably warm weather.
   Snow and blowing snow continued in much of Montana and Wyoming,
and an additional 2 to 4 inches of snow was expected with 15-30 mph
winds. Snow advisories were in effect in both states. In Montana,
the snow was a foot deep in Bozeman and 10 inches deep in Buttle and
Billings.
   The snow spread into South Dakota and western Nebraska. Freezing
drizzle iced roads in the northwest panhandle of Nebraska and the
north-central part of the state.
   The rain scattered over Southern California turned into snow in
the mountains. A snow advisory was issued for the mountains, and
local accumulations of 4 to 8 inches were possible.
   Showers were scattered in eastern Texas and western Louisiana.
   Unseasonably mild weather continued from the lower Great Lakes
region to the middle Mississippi Valley and the southern Plains.
Temperatures were above freezing across much of the region this
morning. Normally, low temperatures across the Great Lakes are in
the single digits and teens.
   Today's forecast called for scattered rain over the lower
Mississippi Valley and western Tennessee, rain from Southern
California to western Arizona and southern Utah, with snow in the
mountains of Southern California and Utah; snow in the central
Rockies and western sections of the northern Plains; and rain in
western Washington state.
   High temperatures were predicted in the teens and 20s in the
northern Rockies, northern Plains, much of Nebraska, the upper
Mississippi Valley and the northern Great Lakes; the 20s in northern
Maine; the 30s and 40s from the northern Pacific Coast to the
central Rockies, the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles, the middle
Mississippi Valley, the lower Great Lakes, the upper Ohio Valley and
the Atlantic Coast from New Jersey to New England; the 70s from the
Gulf Coast to the southern Atlantic Coast; and in the 50s and 60s in
the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 10
degrees below zero at Lake Yellowstone, Wyo., to 67 degrees at
Brownsville, Texas.

   Some residents of the earthquake-stricken
Soviet republic of Tadzhikistan may owe their lives to use of
relatively lightweight concrete roofing used in the region, a
scientist said.
   ``This is something Tadzhikistan engineers took pride in _
lighter weight roofs (of thin, corrugated concrete), and their
encouragement of the use of this kind of building practice,'' Brian
Tucker, California's acting state geologist, said Monday. Tucker has
made extensive studies in the region.
   Early reports from the Soviet news agency Tass indicated about
1,000 people died because of the quake in the Central Asian republic
Monday, at least 600 of them in the farming settlement of Sharora,
one of at least three villages buried by a 50-foot-high slide of
dirt and mud.
   Because the landslide appears to be the biggest killer in the
quake, ``it seems that the majority of people would have died
regardless of the type of roof they had over their head,'' Tucker
said.
   ``But of the people who weren't buried in mud, probably fewer
died due to the collapse of thick ceilings than would have without
the current practice of lightweight roofs,'' Tucker speculated by
phone from Washington, where he was attending a conference.
   Tucker said the improved building practices stemmed from a large
earthquake in 1949, which killed roughly 20,000 people and was
centered east of Dushanbe, Tadzhikistan's capital. Monday's tremor
was centered 20 to 30 miles southwest of Dushanbe.
   Like Monday's quake, which measured a moderate 5.4 on the Richter
scale, the 1949 jolt triggered a huge landslide, Tucker said, adding
that it buried the town of Khait, roughly 50 miles east of Dushanbe.
   The quake 40 years ago prompted the Soviet Academy of Sciences to
establish a permanent research expedition in the town of Garm. The
seismologists and engineers gained better understanding of seismic
risks, started quake prediction efforts and improved building
practices, Tucker said.
   ``One of the little things they could do for these rural
communities was to make these thin, corrugated cement roofs instead
of the thick mud and rock roofs'' traditionally used atop one-story
adobe homes, he said.
   Tucker said because such roofs are common now, the danger of
death from building collapse during Tadzhikistan quakes ``is much
less now than it used to be.''
   Tucker visited Garm more than a dozen times between 1975 and 1983
as part of a U.S.-Soviet exchange program. He studied how shaking
was much more intense on loose soils than on solid rock.
   ``This is important because most dwellings are on sediment-filled
valleys,'' he said. ``All buildings are built there on loose soil.''
   The villages are vulnerable to landslides because they ``are just
nestled in narrow valleys'' in the rugged Pamir and Tien Shan
mountain ranges, he added.
   Tucker said the mountains were uplifted by the collision of India
northward into China and Central Asia. The collision produced a zone
of seismic activity that stretches from Tadzhikistan on the west to
Burma on the east, he said.
   Tucker said Dushanbe, with some 460,000 residents, has
multi-story buildings, mostly made of concrete slabs loosely hooked
together. He speculated they apparently escaped serious damage
because of the city's distance from the quake's epicenter.

<HEAD>Council Decides To Run Town Without Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HICO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This central Texas town has been without a
mayor since July, and City Council has decided it can stay that way
for a while.
   Council members were forced to decide Monday night after the man
who was elected mayor Saturday announced he wouldn't take the job.
   Glenn Marshall, who won on a write-in vote, didn't run for the
post and said afterward that he'd rather be on the City Council than
be mayor. The mayor does not vote on city matters except to break
ties.
   ``The council set out new policies in June of last year and the
mayor really doesn't have a lot of power now in the city except as
just a figurehead,'' said the city secrtary, Mary Scott.
   Marshall was elected mayor when 41 of the 66 voters in the
special election wrote his name on the ballot, which contained no
candidates for mayor. The rest of the votes were scattered among
nine other non-candidates.
   Marshall had been acting mayor since J.M. Blakley resigned after
serving for only two months.
   An election was called to fill the vacancy, but no one filed for
the position. Marshall said any potential candidates probably shied
away from running because of ``too much regulation _ state and
federal _ down the road.''
   The next mayoral election in Hico, which is about 65 miles
southwest of Fort Worth, will be in May.

   Gov. George Deukmejian and 2,000 mourners
stood silently as, every 60 seconds, the name of a victim of the
Stockton schoolyard slayings was read and a tiny bell rung.
   The five minutes of silence Monday, starting at the exact minute
in the day when a man opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle six
days earlier at the Cleveland Elementary School, concluded a
two-hour, multicultural memorial to the refugee children.
   ``Five minutes for five children ... May they rest in peace and
may God bless their families and friends,'' said Vu-Duc Vuong of the
Center for Southeast Asian Resettlement.
   Twenty-nine other children and a teacher were wounded as
24-year-old Patrick Edward Purdy fired more than 100 rounds before
killing himself.
   The mood in the cavernous Stockton Civic Center was somber, but
tears were few. Mourners wore black and white ribbons, described as
traditional Cambodian symbols of mourning.
   Funeral chanting of a dozen orange-robed Buddhist monks
alternated with the Christian hymns of a community chorus.
   Two of the slain children, Oeun Lim, 6, and Rathanar Or, 9, were
Buddhists. Two others, Sokhim An, 6, and Ram Chun, 6, were Baptists;
and Thuy Tran, 6, the only Vietnamese child among the victims, was a
Roman Catholic.
   The ceremony began with funeral services for all but Tran, who
was buried Saturday.
   Speaking from behind the closed, flower-draped caskets of four of
the children and under flags of the pre-Communist Cambodian and
Vietnamese governments, Deukmejian noted the suffering and fear in
the war-torn countries which the families of the young victims had
fled.
   He assured them that last week's shooting last week was an
aberration.
   ``This state is filled with people of good will and brotherly
love who cherish our diversity,'' he said. ``The overwhelming
majority of the people of California are good and caring and
compassionate.''
   About 70 percent of the Cleveland Elementary School's pupils are
from Southeast Asian refugee families. San Joaquin County is home to
about 37,000 immigrants from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
   ``You do not grieve alone,'' Deukmejian said. ``Your sorrow is
our sorrow. Your pain is our pain. This terrible tragedy has shocked
and greatly saddened the people of this state.''

<HEAD>Rescuers Losing Hope They Will Find Survivors In Soviet Quake</HEAD>

   Rescuers probed with bulldozers and shovels today
for survivors in the soggy mass of dirt and rock an earthquake sent
crashing into three Central Asian mountain villages, but expected
only to find bodies.
   The official Tass news agency estimated 1,000 people were killed
in slides loosened by the tremor as it struck a rich agricultural
region of the Soviet republic of Tadzhikistan before dawn Monday.
   ``There is little hope (of finding survivors) because of the
flood of dirt and mud,'' Erkin Kasimov, a spokesman for the
republic's foreign ministry, said today. ``But while there is any
hope, the rescuers will keep working.''
   Official reports said more than 100 people were hospitalized in
the Tadzhik capital of Dushanbe, 20 miles from where the Soviet
Union's second devastating earthquake in two months had caused the
most destruction.
   Vitaly Zhukov, deputy head of the republic's official news
agency, said 11 people died during the night in Dushanbe hospitals.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda blamed the conditions for
mudslides on heavy snows followed by a thaw in hills overlooking the
stricken villages of Sharora, Okuli-Bolo and Okuli-Poyen.
   The thaw moistened the earthen walls of canals that stretched
down to the villages and when the quake hit, the rich earth loosened
and Pravda said it ``moved in a huge mass onto the villages'' _
about 1{ to 1\ miles.
   ``There is a danger of new mudslides in similar places in the
event of a new natural blow,'' the paper said.
   Pravda said previous experience had shown that the Soviet Union
is careless in construction of buildings, especially in rural areas.
However, it did not specifically blame poor construction for any of
the deaths in the area about 1,800 miles southeast of Moscow.
   Poorly constructed apartment buildings have been blamed for many
of the estimated 25,000 deaths in the earthquake that struck
northwestern Armenia Dec. 7. That quake registered 6.9 on the
Richter scale.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said Monday's quake measured 5.4 on
the scale.
   Rescue workers labored today under sunny skies in 50-degree
temperatures in the three adjacent villages, digging with shovels,
bulldozers, cranes and earthmovers, Kasimov said.
   He said the quake and mudslide also damaged farms, homes,
schools, stores and administrative buildings outside the three
villages.
   Zhukov said many of the surviving women and children had been
evacuated, but some remained behind in hopes of finding relatives.
   Rescue workers put up round reinforced tents and built small
wooden huts for survivors and worked to restore communications and
electricity to the area, he said. Food and fuel were also sent to
the scene, Tass said.
   Zainiddin Nasreddinov, editor in chief of the Tadzhik news
agency, estimated that about 600 people were killed in Sharora _
almost the entire population.
   The 40-second tremor was centered 20 to 30 miles southwest of
Dushanbe, a city of more than 460,000 people, Tass said. The area is
in the fertile Gissar district, a vineyard and livestock-raising
center.
   The earthquake unhinged a wall of loess at least five miles wide
that buried Okuli-Bolo and much of Sharora, said Kasimov. Officials
said most of the victims were asleep at the time.
   Residents of Okuli-Poyen, apparently roused in time, fled in
panic before the slide could reach their homes, Kasimov said from
Dushanbe.
   In Okuli-Bolo and Okuli-Poyen, ``everything is destroyed _ all
the homes, the schools, the hospitals and clinics, the stores,''
Nasreddinov said.
   Okuli-Bolo is a ``heap of rubble'' and the chairman of a local
economic cooperative, Hairrulo Yuldashev, said the households of 70
peasant families were ``completely demolished and buried by the
landslide,'' Tass said.
   The TV news program ``Vremya'' showed aerial footage of Sharora,
with white roofs of buried homes peeking through the dirt like
seashells scattered on a beach.
   The Kremlin leadership sent condolences and promised aid.
According to Nasreddinov, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev telephoned
Tadzhikistan officials to promise Moscow's help.

<HEAD>Shipyard Recommended As Sludge Processing Site In Boston Harbor Cleanup</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quincy residents won't smell a thing, but officials
in the suburb say they still will fight a proposal to build one of
the country's biggest sewage sludge processing plants.
   A recommendation to build the plant at the defunct Fore River
Shipyard was announced Monday by Massachusetts Water Resources
Authority head Paul Levy, who said the process _ which turns waste
into compost instead of burning it _ wouldn't give off an odor.
   ``I don't propose to build anything unless I would feel
comfortable living next door to it,'' Levy said.
   But Quincy officials on Monday conferred on ways to fight the
proposal. And the federal Environmental Protection Agency planned to
ask a federal judge to require the authority to build a backup
sludge incinerator, said Paul Keough, deputy EPA regional
administrator.
   According to Levy, the processing plant would be one of the
nation's largest, comparable in size to plants in Akron, Ohio, and
Los Angeles.
   The full water resources authority's board is expected to approve
Levy's recommendation Feb. 1.
   Cost and convenience were the chief reasons for choosing the
shipyard, Levy said. The authority already owns the property, unlike
the two other proposed sites: Spectacle Island in Boston Harbor and
a 90-acre site in Stoughton, another suburb south of Boston.
   The shipyard already has been scheduled for a temporary sludge
treatment plant beginning in 1991. The permanent plant is scheduled
for completion in 1995.
   The $193 million estimated cost of building and operating a
sludge plant over 25 years compares to $208 million for the
Stoughton site and $258 million for Spectacle Island.
   Quincy City Councilor Michael Cheney has already said he plans to
urge the city to sue to battle the proposal. The chief concerns
among officials in Quincy and neighboring Weymouth are excess
traffic and odor.
   State Rep. Robert Cerasoli, whose district includes the shipyard,
blamed Quincy Mayor Francis X. McCauley for agreeing to allow the
authority to use the shipyard as a temporary sludge treatment site.
   ``I didn't think that after five years they'd abandon the interim
plant,'' Cerasoli said.

<TEXT>
   Japan's senior economic planner resigned today, the
third Cabinet member to step down in less than two months in
connection with a stock-trading scandal that has shaken public
confidence in the government.
   The resignation of Ken Harada was expected to put heavy pressure
on several other Cabinet members, including Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita, who have acknowledged links to the company at the center
of the storm.
   Harada had led a parliamentary committee investigating the
scandal until he became head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency in
a Dec. 27 Cabinet shuffle.
   In a televised news conference following his resignation, Harada
acknowledged reports he had received regular political donations
from Recruit Co., but denied any wrongdoing and said the company had
``absolutely not asked for any favors'' in return.
   The national newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported today that Harada
had received $80 a month from Recruit for 14 years. In addition, a
Recruit subsidiary donated about $8,000 at a Harada fund-raising
party in August, it said.
   In the stock scandal, Recruit, an information conglomerate, made
available hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in a subsidiary,
Recruit-Cosmos, to dozens of prominent people who made large profits
after the stocks were listed for public trading and rose quickly in
value.
   Neither the donations nor the stock transactions were illegal of
themselves, but questions of bribery, ethics and undue business
influence on politicians were raised.
   Only three days after Takeshita formed his new Cabinet in
December, Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa stepped down after it
was disclosed that he also had received regular donations from
Recruit.
   A member of the previous Cabinet, Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, stepped down in early December in connection with the
scandal.
   Miyazawa resigned after having repeatedly changed his explanation
of a close aide's purchase of the unlisted stock shares.
   Takeshita has acknowledged that an aide and a relative profited
from the sale of Recruit-Cosmos shares. News reports have said
Recruit's former chairman, Hiromasa Ezoe, also gave Takeshita's
political support group $38,000 in 1987 and 1988.
   Kyodo News Service reported that Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo
Obuchi has received $160 a month from Recruit, and Agriculture
Minister Tsutomu Hata has acknowledged that Recruit bought tickets
for a fund-raising party in 1986 at an undisclosed price.
   Obuchi, who serves as chief government spokesman, told reporters
today that the Cabinet would launch a thorough investigation into
ties between Recruit and Cabinet members.

   Five hours before his execution today, Ted
Bundy called to tell his mother goodbye and sounded ``wonderful ...
very much at peace with himself,'' she said.
   ``He kept saying how sorry he was, that `there was another part
of me that people didn't know,''' Louise Bundy said.
   For unexplained reasons, Bundy was allowed two 10-minute calls,
rather than the one expected by Mrs. Bundy, the Morning News Tribune
of Tacoma reported.
   At the conclusion of the second call, Mrs. Bundy told the
confessed serial killer, ``You'll always be my precious son.''
   When the first call came shortly before 11 p.m. PST, Bundy's
adoptive father, John Bundy, turned to his wife and said quietly,
``You do the talking.''
   After the initial hellos, she said, ``We just want you to know
how much we love you and always will.''
   Her voice shook with emotion. When he spoke, she rapidly wrote
down the messages he asked her to give friends and loved ones.
   ``He sounds wonderful,'' his mother said after the first call.
``He sounds very much at peace with himself.
   ``He said, `I'm so sorry I've given you all such grief ... but a
part of me was hidden all the time,' and then he said, `but the Ted
Bundy you knew also existed.' ''
   In the second call, she told him, ``We're all praying for you.''
   Later she told the friends in her living room, ``He said God's
spirit was with him.''
   The mood at the Bundy home was grieving but subdued. Mrs. Bundy
raised her voice only when asked about the death penalty.
   ``I think it's barbaric!'' she said. ``What good does it do? It's
legalized murder is all. It's not a deterrent. They've been killing
people for thousands of years (in executions) and what good has it
done?''
   Mrs. Bundy planned to be at a friend's home with family members
and her minister when the execution was carried out this morning.
   On Monday, she said she was upset her son hadn't told her about
the killings before confessing to law enforcement officials.
   ``It's a terrible thing,'' Mrs. Bundy said. ``He wasn't raised
that way. He was raised in a good, loving, caring family. We still
love and care for him, but we want to know what caused this.''
   When asked whether her son is mentally ill, Mrs. Bundy said, ``I
think he must be. He must be! How could anybody not be, and commit
those crimes?
   ``I would have liked to have known it from him ahead of time,
yes. It would have still hurt very badly, but getting it second hand
was pretty devastating.''
   Mrs. Bundy said she never had any indication that her son hated
women but believed he was jilted by a woman he loved in 1972 or
1973, perhaps triggering hatred that led to the killings.

   Many residents of this small North Florida
town expressed hope that Ted Bundy's execution today would restore
their community spirit and belief in the American judicial system.
   Bundy died in the electric chair for the 1978 rape and murder of
Lake City schoolgirl Kimberly Leach after his trials and subsequent
appeals dragged through the judicial system for years.
   ``There is no doubt there's been a tremendous erosion of public
confidence in the system because of Ted Bundy,'' said Jerry Blair,
the state attorney who prosecuted Bundy for the murder of the
12-year-old girl.
   ``It's sort of like the Super Bowl,'' Mayor Gerald Witt said
before the execution. ``We're just waiting for it to happen.
   ``It'll give everybody a feeling of relief, and make everybody
smile, to know he's finally been electrocuted. He's destroyed so
many lives ... it seems like he's just a living devil.''
   The execution will be celebrated tonight with a barbecue at the
Naked Lady tavern north of town. The owners advertised the
celebration with a sign that reads, ``We're Cooking Too.''
   A neighboring business, Weggy's Package Store on Highway 441,
displayed what has become a common slogan in Florida on its outdoor
sign, ``Buckle Up Bundy, It's the Law.''
   Although Bundy has confessed to the murders of other young women
in recent days, it's Kimberly's murder that turned this small,
crossroads community of fewer than 10,000 people into a town without
pity.
   State Trooper Ken Robinson, who found Kimberly's body in an
abandoned pig sty, planned to witness the execution, as did Blair.
   ``We'll all be better off when this is history,'' Robinson said.
   Retired school Superintendent Silas Pittman, like many residents
here, said he hoped Bundy's execution would help them again become a
town capable of forgiveness and compassion.
   ``There's no question about it, it'll be a therapeutic act,''
said Blair.
   ``A lot of people say the law of the land should be carried
out,'' said the Rev. Edwin F. Montgomery, pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church and an opponent of the death penalty. ``It's
almost like something is unfinished.''
   But Montgomery said he believes most people would have put the
tragedy behind them long ago had Bundy been sentenced to a life in
prison.
   ``Many people haven't been able to get past the anger in the
grief process,'' he said. ``We never got resolution because we're
still in the anger stage.''

   Residents expressed resentment about their
town being known as ``Execution City'' as journalists overran the
town to cover today's electrocution of confessed serial killer Ted
Bundy.
   More than 100 journalists, accompanied by satellite dishes, vans
and even mobile homes, began setting up early Monday at the former
cow pasture across from the state prison building where Bundy was
set to become the 20th convict to be executed since Florida resumed
executions nearly 10 years ago.
   ``This is the most I've seen,'' said Bob Macmaster, a state
Corrections Department spokesman. ``The media has really overflowed
the small media area we had set aside.''
   More journalists were arriving by the dozens, including some from
Western states where Bundy is linked to as many as three dozen
female victims.
   ``Bundy has been the boogeyman of the Northwest for 15 years,''
said Mary Mapes, a producer for KIRO-TV in Seattle. ``He really
inspires fear and fascination.''
   Jacksonville graphic artist George Johnson, parked just outside
the entrance to the Florida State Prison, said he had sold six dozen
T-shirts that depicted Bundy in the electric chair, with the slogan:
``Burn, Bundy, Burn.''
   Johnson said most of his sales, at $10 a shirt, were to
journalists and prison employees.
   ``They're ready to see him burn. I think he's an animal,'' said
Johnson. Johnson said he lived near Salt Lake City in the mid-1970s,
when the bodies of suspected Bundy victims there were found.
   A banner on Johnson's car advertised, ``Tuesday is Fryday.''
   People in this town of some 5,000 people have grown resentful of
their portrayal by out-of-town reporters. While the five state
prisons that lie within 20 miles are the major employers in the
area, residents point out they are 11 miles from the prison and
shouldn't be known as home of the electric chair.
   ``I feel the people of this community have the attitude of the
state,'' resident Lila Yawn said. ``I don't think they're
bloodthirsty. I think we're just like any other normal American
town.''
   Today's execution came as this city is recovering from a drug
scandal and is worried about state plans for a Jacksonville-to-Tampa
turnpike. Some businesspersons say the turnpike could either boost
the city or kill it, depending on how close it comes to the town.
   Meanwhile, at 7 a.m., as Bundy was being executed, the polls were
opening for the special election of a new police chief, replacing
one who was charged with grand theft last year. A year earlier saw
nearly three dozen federal drug-related cases involving police
officers, the former county attorney and school officials.

   Three women who survived Ted Bundy's
murderous rampage at a sorority house and a nearby apartment
building 11 years ago have rebuilt their lives, but physical and
emotional scars remain.
   Bundy, who was executed today for the rape and murder of a
12-year-old Lake City girl, was also under death sentences for the
bludgeoning murders of two Chi Omega sorority sisters at Florida
State University.
   On Jan. 15, 1978, Bundy roamed from bedroom to bedroom of the
sorority house, wielding a 3-foot-long oak limb. Four women, who had
been sleeping during the early morning hours, were bludgeoned and
bitten, and at least one was sexually assaulted, authorities said.
Two died.
   ``I used to hate his guts, and I used to be scared of him,'' said
Kathy Kleiner, 31, one of the survivors. ``I really now feel sorry
for him ... I want it to be over.''
   Kleiner, then a 20-year-old sophomore, was found down the hall
from her dead sorority sisters, Margaret Bowman and Lisa Levy. She
was sitting in bed, rocking back and forth in pain, calling for her
boyfriend.
   Kleiner said her recovery has been long and painful. Bundy broke
her jaw in three places, and it was wired shut for nearly three
months. She never returned to college. Six months later, she married
her boyfriend. Six years later they divorced.
   Today, she is engaged and works at a South Florida hospital. She
agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her hometown not be
disclosed.
   Karen Chandler, then a 22-year-old senior, was the first to be
found after the Chi Omega attack. She staggered down the hall, her
jaw broken and four teeth knocked out. She also suffered a broken
right arm and a crushed index finger.
   Now married, she lives in Atlanta with her husband and their
2-year-old son and infant daughter.
   ``I don't think it will be over for any of us until it is
resolved one way or another,'' she said.
   Cheryl Thomas was a 21-year-old dance student when Bundy broke
into her apartment shortly after the sorority house attack a few
blocks away. He broke her jaw and severed a nerve leading to her
left ear, leaving her with a profound hearing loss and balance
problems.
   Her injuries destroyed her dream of becoming a professional
dancer. She recovered but still does not want to talk about the
attack, said her mother, Anne, of Richmond, Va.
   Although she never returned to Florida State, she eventually
earned a bachelor's degree in dance and a master's degree in deaf
education. She teaches ballet and works with the deaf. She is
married and has a daughter.
   ``She pulled back. We're really proud,'' her mother said. ``Every
day of my life I thank God for her life.''

<HEAD>U.S. Embassy Warns Americans to Leave Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy announced today it has
advised Americans who are private citizens to leave Afghanistan.
   Jon D. Glassman, charge d'affaires at the American Embassy, said
the situation was reaching ``a critical point,'' and he urged
Americans to get out while commercial air service still is operating.
   Only the Soviet airline Aeroflot, using military planes, and the
Afghan airline Ariana are still operating out of Kabul's airport.
Ariana flights are unpredictable, sometimes delayed or canceled
until Soviet shipments of aviation fuel arrive.
   The warning, in a letter sent to U.S. nationals, followed a
similar warning by the British Embassy last week to Britons and
nationals of six other countries for which it has diplomatic
responsibility, including Canada, Australia and Ireland.
   ``They've finally gotten through to us,'' said Richard Penner, a
Canadian who heads the International Aid Mission, a multinational
charitable organization of missionaries. He said most of the group
decided to leave but that he was going to stay.
   Penner said the group would be down to 10 by Feb. 11, compared
with 52 now and 85 during the summer.
   Except for the 11 U.S. citizens working at the embassy, most of
the Americans in Afghanistan belong to the missionary organization.
   Other private citizens in Afghanistan include Red Cross workers,
officials of U.N. aid agencies, and a dwindling group of Soviet
civilian advisers.
   Concern about the situation in Afghanistan has risen as the Feb.
15 deadline for the Soviet army's withdrawal approaches.
   The Red Army intervened in Afghanistan's civil war in December
1979, backing government troops in their fight with Moslem
guerrillas. Half their estimated 100,000 soldiers were out of the
country by Aug. 15, and the remainder are to be out by Feb. 15.
   The Soviets announced late last year they had suspended the
withdrawal because of continuing U.S. and Pakistani aid to the
guerrillas, and they have not announced a resumption of the pullout
despite evidence it's in full swing.
   Western diplomats said today heavy convoy and air traffic around
Kabul indicates the final Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan is
proceeding.
   On Monday afternoon, a 70-vehicle military convoy, including six
tanks, armored personnel carriers and troop trucks, moving out from
Kabul and headed north toward the Soviet border on the Salang
highway.
   In addition, Afghan soldiers have taken over some guard posts
around Kabul from the Soviet troops, and hundreds of Soviet soldiers
have been seen boarding transport planes at Kabul's airport.
   Western analysts believe the Soviets want to cover up the
withdrawal for both security and political reasons. These include
trying to maintain political leverage to persuade rebel leaders to
resume negotiations for a coalition government that would include
the Marxists.
   Diplomats in Pakistan reported intense fighting between Communist
forces and rebels in northern Kunduz province, and in Nangarhar and
Kandahar provinces to the east.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed a
rebel report Monday of heavy fighting around the provincial capital
of Kunduz, 36 miles south of the Soviet border.
   They were unable to confirm rebel claims that guerrillas had shot
down three planes.
   Rebel and diplomatic sources also reported battles around the
eastern city of Jalababad, capital of Nangarhar province bordering
Pakistan.

<HEAD>Jury Sentences Man to Death for Second Time</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A convicted multiple murderer faces a death
sentence for the second time in the slaying of a teen-ager, becoming
the first defendant to undergo a second capital punishment trial
under New Jersey law.
   A Monmouth County jury sentenced Richard Biegenwald, 48, to death
Monday for the slaying of Anna Olesiewicz, 19, more than five years
ago.
   The jury returned the death sentence after six hours of
deliberations. The state Supreme Court had let stand the murder
conviction, but overturned Biegenwald's first death sentence because
of trial errors and ordered him resentenced by a new jury.
   New Jersey law requires one trial to determine guilt or innocence
and a second to determine sentence. Biegenwald is the first to go
through a second death penalty trial under New Jersey's 7-year-old
capital punishment law.
   Superior Court Judge Patrick McGann ordered Biegenwald executed
by lethal injection on March 15. However, that date will be
postponed because the state Supreme Court automatically reviews all
death sentences.
   In addition to his two murder convictions, Biegenwald pleaded
guilty to the murders of two young women in the Monmouth-Ocean area
during the early 1980s. Prosecutors also suspect Biegenwald in a
fifth slaying.
   A defense attorney urged the jury to spare Biegenwald's life,
saying he would be valuable for studying sociopathic behavior.
   But Assistant Monmouth County Prosecutor James Fagen
characterized Biegenwald as evil and a ``cold-blooded murderer.''
   Biegenwald declined an opportunity to make his own plea to the
jury.
   Fagen said Biegenwald was sentenced to life for a murder
conviction in 1959, but murdered again when released on parole.
   ``Did that rehabilitate him? No,'' Fagen said. ``If it was
punishment, did he learn from it? No. For him, there is only one
punishment.''
   Defense attorney Louis Diamond argued that Biegenwald's beatings
as a child and the harsh treatment he received in psychiatric
hospitals, including electroshock therapy, taught him ``that life is
meaningless, death is meaningless.''
   He also said Biegenwald may have had a motive for killing Ms.
Olesiewicz, saying that the two had smoked marijuana together, an
act that would have jeopordized his parole status after his release
from prison for the 1959 murder.
   Under state law, a jury is permitted to return a death sentence
if it finds a murder was committed without a reason.

   A shuttle boat that ferries people between Los
Angeles and Santa Catalina Island caught fire early today when its
engine overheated, and authorities rescued and then arrested three
people on board, officials said.
   The unidentified people were taken into custody because they
hadn't been authorized to run the 56-foot Channel Express, said Fire
Department Capt. Edward Carlson.
   ``All I know is they weren't authorized to move the boat,'' he
said. ``They may have been employees, I don't know.''
   The three were the only people on the ship at the time, Carlson
said. There were no injuries.
   The boat was reported burning at 3:12 a.m. just outside the
harbor, Carlson said. He said three fire boats doused the blaze
within 10 minutes and the Coast Guard then towed the boat back to
its berth.
   The blaze caused $500,000 damage, Carlson said.
   An investigation determined the fire in the engine room started
when the engine overheated because water valves had not been opened,
he said.

   The Supreme Court today rejected
the appeal of Abbas Ali Hamadi, who was sentenced to 13 years in
prison last year for his role in the kidnappings of two West German
businessmen in Beirut.
   Hamadi was convicted by a Duesseldorf court in April of taking
part in the kidnappings in an effort to win freedom for his brother,
Mohammed, who had been arrested in Frankfurt in connection with the
1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner.
   The Supreme Court rejected the appeal without explanation.
   Abbas Hamadi was also convicted of attempting to blackmail the
West German government and of helping his brother smuggle liguid
explosives into the country.
   The West German hostages, Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt, have
since been released.
   Mohammed Hamadi has been on trial since July in Frankfurt. He is
charged with murder and air piracy in the TWA hijacking, which
claimed the life of a U.S. Navy diver. During the ordeal, 39
Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   The younger Hamadi has admitted his role in the hijacking but has
denied killing Navy diver Robert Stethem.

   Ted Bundy, the ``diabolical'' law school
dropout who confessed to killing 20 women in four Western states,
was executed in the electric chair today for the 1978 rape and
murder of a 12-year-old girl.
   At 7:06 a.m., six minutes past schedule, the executioner turned
on 2,000 volts of electricity and Bundy gently arched back in the
chair and clenched his fists. One minute later, the power was turned
off.
   ``At 7:16 this morning, the doctor at Florida State Prison
pronounced Theodore Bundy dead,'' said Jon Peck, a spokesman for
Florida Gov. Bob Martinez. ``He was executed right on schedule.''
   In his final statement, Bundy said, ``Jim and Fred, I'd like you
to give my love to my family and friends.''
   Jim Coleman is Bundy's attorney from Washington, D.C., and Fred
Lawrence is a Methodist minister who spent the night in prayer with
him.
   In addition to praying, a remorseful Bundy, 42, also placed two
last calls to his mother in Tacoma, Wash., to say farewell.
   ``He sounds wonderful,'' Louise Bundy said after the first
telephone call. ``He sounds very much at peace with himself.''
   At the conclusion of the second, Bundy's mother told him,
``You'll always be my precious son,'' according to today's Morning
News Tribune of Tacoma.
   Bundy, who had dodged three previous execution dates through
appeals, has been called a suspect in as many as 36 deaths. In
addition to the crime for which he was executed, he was under a
death sentence for the murders of two Florida State University
sorority sisters.
   Around 5:30 a.m., the final preparations began with a prison
official shaving Bundy's head and right leg, where the electrodes
were later placed.
   When Bundy entered the chamber at 7:01 a.m., wearing a light blue
shirt and dark blue pants, he looked frightened but walked directly
to the electric chair. After being seated he nodded to his attorney
and minister and mouthed words to them.
   Forty-two people witnessed the execution from behind a plexiglass
partition. They included 12 official witnesses, among them a state
representative and three state attorneys; 12 reporters; and 18 other
people, mostly corrections officials.
   More than 100 people supporting the execution and about two dozen
against milled around outside the Florida State Prison. At 7 a.m. a
small group of death penalty supporters lit sparklers and
firecrackers and cheered, while opponents silently held candles and
then held a memorial service.
   Within a half hour of the execution, a hearse carried Bundy's
body out of the prison to Gainesville for an autopsy.
   The execution brought a sigh of relief in the LaConner, Wash.,
home of Vivian Rancourt, whose daughter, Susan, was among Bundy's
victims. ``Good,'' Mrs. Rancourt said when told Bundy was dead.
``The only thing I can say is thank God, it's finally over.''
   Bundy's final appeals, including a series to the U.S. Supreme
Court, were rejected Monday.
   On Tuesday morning, Peck said, ``The governor told the
superintendent at the prison there were no stays, saying, `On behalf
of the countless victims of Theodore Bundy both dead and living,
throughout Florida and the nation, I direct you to proceed to carry
out the court-ordered sentence.'''
   The execution was the 20th in Florida since it resumed executions
in 1979; 106 murderers have been put to death in the United States
since capital punishment was restored in 1976.
   Bundy, known for his cockiness and arrogance, was ``subdued and
emotional'' on Monday, said prison spokesman Bob Macmaster.
   He met with a psychiatrist Monday evening as his attorneys filed
requests to delay the execution.
   Visitors also included James Dobson, a psychologist and Christian
broadcaster, who said that Bundy had expressed ``great remorse'' and
had ``resolved his relationship with God.''
   Bundy wept openly during the interview, admitted he was a
murderer and said society had a right to protect itself from people
``with his weakness,'' according to Dobson, whose ``Focus on the
Family'' is heard on 1,300 radio stations.
   Bundy was condemned for the kidnapping, rape and murder of
12-year-old Kimberly Leach of Lake City. Her body was found in an
abandoned pigsty. He also was sentenced to death for killing the two
Florida State students in Tallahassee in 1978.
   Residents of Lake City hoped Bundy's execution would help the
community put the gruesome case behind them.
   ``It's sort of like the Super Bowl,'' Gerald Witt, mayor of the
northern Florida town, said Monday of the execution. ``It'll give
everybody a feeling of relief, and make everybody smile, to know
he's finally been electrocuted. ...
   ``He's destroyed so many lives ... it seems like he's just a
living devil.''
   Bundy, who grew up in Tacoma, was linked to three dozen killings
of young women. As the execution approached, he met with
investigators from Western states and admitted killing eight women
each in Washington and Utah and two each in Colorado and Idaho,
authorities said.
   ``I think he was born to kill,'' said Bob Keppel of Washington's
state attorney general's office, who interviewed Bundy during the
weekend.
   ``I don't know if it was a bad seed or what, but boy, ... he was
just totally consumed with murder. All the time. He had to be.''
   Bundy was the subject of five books and a television miniseries,
``The Deliberate Stranger.'' A federal judge once called him ``the
most competent serial killer in the country at this time ... a
diabolical genius.''
   Three psychiatrists appointed by Martinez waited at the prison
Monday in case Bundy's attorneys raised the claim that he was
mentally incompetent to be executed.
   But Martinez added that the execution would go forward: ``Justice
ought to fit the crime and in this case it's clear that when he
eliminated not only Kimberly Leach but all the others, that he chose
to have his life forfeited.'' About 100 phone calls and dozens of
letters and telegrams have been received at the governor's office in
recent days, with the vast majority supporting execution, said Brian
Ballard, director of operations.
   The execution also inspired bizzare humor from radio stations,
with a Jacksonville station, WQIK, urging listeners to turn off
unnecessary appliances between 6:45 and 7 a.m. to ensure plenty of
``juice'' for the electric chair at the nearby prison.
   Bundy, who dropped out of law school after a year, is believed to
have stalked young women near college campuses, shopping centers and
parks in the West and Northwest, targeting those with long, dark
hair, parted in the middle.
   Prosecutors said he often lured victims into his car by posing as
police officer or making false requests for aid.
   One of the women he admitted killing was Caryn Campbell, 23, of
Dearborn, Mich., who was killed by a blow to the head while
vacationing in Colorado in 1975.
   ``You never really forgive someone for something like that. You
just try to put it behind you,'' her father, Robert Campbell, said
Monday. ``It's not important to me now. The thing I'd like to have
back, I can't have.''

   An elderly couple whose daylong fishing
trip turned into a nightmare when a storm blew their boat out to sea
survived on ocean water and a day's worth of food before they were
rescued five days later.
   The couple's boat washed up onto an isolated island three days
after it went adrift, but the two didn't know they were just 500
yards from a caretakers cottage and went without food for two nights
until their rescue Monday.
   Thomas Pettigrew, 81, said the sight of a Marine helicopter
hovering over the island about 45 miles south of Charleston was
``worth all the tea in China.''
   The Charleston resident and his 80-year-old wife, Katie, were
listed in good condition today at Beaufort Memorial Hospital, where
they were being treated for dehydration and exposure.
   ``Considering the fact that they have had no food for four days
and significant exposure, I think they're doing great,'' said Dr.
Lester Haddad, director of the hospital's emergency room.
   The Pettigrews left Charleston on Thursday in their 18-foot
fiberglass boat. But they were blown out to sea and tossed around in
12-foot waves for three days before their craft washed up on St.
Phillips Island late Saturday.
   It wasn't until Monday that a helicopter from the Marine Corps
Air Station in Beaufort spotted them while on a training mission,
the Coast Guard said.
   A storm system that moved through the area over the weekend
brought winds of 25 to 45 mph and temperatures as low as 35 degrees
early Sunday, officials said.
   The Coast Guard searched offshore waters Friday after the couple
was reported overdue. But the effort, which included airplanes and a
110-foot cutter, was suspended late Sunday.
   Pettigrew said he never doubted that he and his wife of 44 years
would be rescued.
   ``I didn't give up my hopes,'' he said. ``I wasn't afraid of
anything no more once I got on that island. I knew I was on dry
land. I was hoping I would get something to eat.''
   But it wasn't until he and his wife were rescued that they were
fed. During the couple's two nights on the island, they never
realized they were about 500 yards from a caretakers cottage, said
Lt. Quain Kahler of the Charleston Coast Guard Base.

<HEAD>Radical Group Claims Vanden Boeynants Is Alive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Left-wing radicals claiming to hold
former Prime Minister Paul Vanden Boeynants said today the
politician is alive, 10 days after his disappearance.
   ``He is alive and will confess,'' the Revolutionary Socialist
Brigade said in a typewritten note sent to the Brussels daily Le
Soir. The note was accompanied by two handwritten pages, purportedly
by Vanden Boeynants, and an identity card that appeared to belong to
him.
   Police said they were investigating the authenticity of the
documents.
   The brigade claimed last week it kidnapped Vanden Boeynants, who
disappeared Jan. 14, and said it was holding him for ransom. Nothing
had been heard from the group since last Tuesday.
   Two other left-wing groups _ the notorious Direct Action and the
Fighting Communist Cells _ also have claimed they kidnapped the
69-year-old Belgian.
   ``There are elements that could allow us to think that they (the
brigade) are holding Mr. Vanden Boeynants,'' said Andre Vandoren,
the deputy Brussels prosecutor.
   In its last communication Jan. 17, the brigade said Vanden
Boeynants would appear before a ``People's Tribunal,'' and it
threatened to kill him.
   Today's letter said he ``will appear free before the people,'' if
$790,000 ransom is paid. Two-thirds of the money must go to the poor
and the rest to the group, says the brigade, which is unknown to
police.
   The letter purportedly from Vanden Boeynants was clear only in
parts. It said in part:
   ``Through the BSR (brigade), I will make a statement to the press
shortly after my release saying I had to take the initiative to give
within six weeks a large amount of aid to relief groups for the
poorest regardless of their politics, language or religious
beliefs.''
   The letter did not mention a release date.
   Vanden Boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and from
late 1978 until early 1979.
   In 1986, he received a three-year suspended sentence for tax
evasion and fraud as head of his meatpacking business.
   Vanden Boeynants disappeared the day before parliament was to
open an inquiry into his affairs. On Sunday, a judicial dossier
linked to that investigation disappeared.

   Ted Bundy, executed today in Florida's electric chair, wrote
often about his belief in God and spent his last hours praying. Here
is an excerpt from a 1975 poem he sent to Ann Rule, a friend and
author of the book, ``The Stranger Beside Me,'' while he was
imprisoned in Utah on a kidnapping and assault conviction:
   ``Sleep comes on slowly
   Read the words of the wholly (sic)
   The scriptures bring peace
   They talk of release
   They bring us to God
   In here that seems odd
   But His gift is so clear
   I find that He's near
   Mercy and redemption
   Without an exception
   He puts me at ease
   Jailer, do what you please
   No harm can befall me
   When the Savior does call me.''

<HEAD>Man Tries to Set Fire to Raphael Painting at Vatican</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs with man identified. Pickup 7th pvs, `Museum

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man in a wheelchair tried to set fire to a
16th century painting by Raphael in the Vatican Museum today by
setting ablaze a flammable liquid he tossed at the painting, Vatican
officials said.
   Museum guards restrained the man, quickly extinguished the flames
and prevented the work from being damaged, said Vatican spokesman
Joaquin Navarro.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said police identified the man as
Thomas Lange, a 31-year-old West German from Berlin who had been
living in Italy about a year. Earlier, Navarro said the man spoke
only English.
   The incident occurred in the Vatican Picture Gallery, which
contains some of Raphael's most famous works. Navarro said the man's
target was the Madonna of Foligno, painted from 1512 to 1513.
   Navarro said the man, who had been noticed by guards in the
museum in previous days, struggled up from his wheelchair, took out
a thermos and tossed a liquid toward the painting.
   The liquid landed on the floor and wall beneath the painting, and
the man then tossed a lighted match to set it ablaze, Navarro said.
He said the flames did not reach the painting.
   Navarro described the man as ``showing signs of being
handicapped, also mentally.''
   Museum officials took down the work to check for possible smoke
damage. It was to be back on display Wednesday.
   Navarro said the man was also carrying two spray bombs of the
type used for personal defense and another bottle of an unidentified
liquid.
   The 10-by6{-foot canvas the man tried to damage depicts the
Madonna with child seated on clouds above a sphere surrounded by
cherubs. Beneath are Saints John the Baptist, Francis and Jerome. In
the distance are the Umbrian town of Foligno.
   The most serious vandalism against a Vatican work of art occurred
in 1972 when Hungarian-born Laszlo Toth battered Michelangelo's
famed Pieta with a hammer inside St. Peter's Basilica.
   Toth, who screamed ``I am Jesus Christ'' as he attacked the
statue, broke off the Madonna's left arm and veil and dented the
left side of the face.
   The masterpiece was fully restored and is now protected by
bulletproof glass in the basilica.

<HEAD>California Awards $56,000 To Women Claiming Sexual Assault By Lawyer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two women who claim famed divorce lawyer
Marvin Mitchelson sexually assaulted them were awarded $56,000 for
medical and psychiatric care despite the refusal of authorities to
prosecute the cases.
   The state Board of Control, a three-member crime victims
compensation panel, concluded Monday that Kristin Barrett-Whitney
and Patricia French were telling the truth about the alleged
assaults.
   Ms. Barrett-Whitney was awarded $46,000 and Ms. French, $10,000.
The money comes from fines paid by criminals.
   Mitchelson, who gained national attention for his handling of
divorce and ``palimony'' cases involving celebrities, has
steadfastly denied the allegations. He has called the women, both
former clients, ``professional extortionists.''
   Mitchelson could not be reached for comment on the award. A
message left with his answering service before business hours today
was not immediately returned.
   The alleged assaults, which were said to have occurred in 1981
and 1985, were the subject of a segment on CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes''
last year.
   The county district attorney's office, after a lengthy
investigation, decided early last year there was insufficient
evidence to prosecute the cases. The state attorney general's office
also reviewed the cases but declined to prosecute.
   Ms. Barrett-Whitney's psychiatrist, Dr. Gary Shepherd, called the
panel's decision fascinating.
   ``The district attorney won't prosecute, but the state will pay
money, because they say a crime occurred,'' he said.
   Austin Eaton, executive officer of the Board of Control, said the
board's standard of proof is less stringent than that required in a
criminal prosecution.
   A preponderance of evidence is all that is required by the board,
rather than the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard followed by
prosecutors, Eaton said.
   The board heard about 20 minutes of testimony from the women, a
psychiatrist and a police detective who investigated their claims in
1986.
   The Los Angeles police detective, Robert Kestler, testified that
he believed the women were telling the truth.
   Mitchelson was not invited by the board to testify before it.
   Both women praised the board's decision.
   ``I've fought long and hard for this,'' Ms. Barrett-Whitney said.
She also vowed to continue to push for Mitchelson's prosecution.

<HEAD>Thousands Pay Last Respect to Surrealist Master</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD LORANT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FIGUERAS, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A steady stream of people filed by the
open casket of Salvador Dali today to pay their last respects to the
surrealist painter who brought so much attention to his small
hometown.
   Dali, his signature handlebar mustache neatly trimmed and long
wisps of hair framing his face, was laid out in an open casket in
his Galatea Tower residence, dressed in an off-white silk tunic.
   Two 16-year-old boys in a line of 250 people waiting outside
admitted they knew the once outspoken Dali only as a famous old
recluse.
   But they said they know his art from visits to the
Theater-Museum, where Dali will be buried beneath the collection of
his works that draws 350,000 people a year to Figueras, near the
French border in northeastern Spain.
   ``It's great that he is getting so much attention,'' said one of
the teen-agers, Xavier Diaz. ``But when they start giving him titles
when he's dead, that's pretty ridiculous.''
   Dali has been showered with honors, including a posthumous medal
from the Catalonian capital of Barcelona. Mayor Mariano Lorca of
Figueras, Dali's hometown, said the medal was placed on Dali's chest
for a short time before his body was embalmed Monday.
   ``Figueras owes him everything,'' said townsman Carlos Arche, 40.
``I'm here to say my last goodbye, that's all.''
   Several older visitors sobbed as they left the building.
   White lace cloths draped with ribbons of black crepe hung from
balconies around the center of the town of 33,000. Town authorities
have declared three days of mourning.
   Dali's body will lie in state until the funeral service Wednesday
in the 14th century Gothic parish church of Sant Pere, where the
painter was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church 84 years ago.
   He is to be buried beneath the geodesic dome of the adjacent
Theater-Museum Dali, a converted municipal theater where he held his
first exhibition in 1918, when he was 14 years old.
   The artist died Monday in Figueras hospital, where he had been
admitted Jan. 18 because of severe heart trouble aggravated by
pneumonia.
   According to the Spanish weekly Panorama, Dali's fortune is worth
nearly $88 million and includes works in the Theater-Museum, others
belonging to the Gala-Dali Foundation that runs it, his private
collection and real estate.
   Under Spanish law, Dali's will cannot be read until at least 15
days after his death.
   The will reportedly divides his estate among the governments of
Figueras, Catalonia and Spain. It has not been revealed which, if
any, of Dali's circle of collaborators will act as executor.
   Dali's only close living relative, his sister Ana Maria, refused
to visit her dying brother, the Barcelona daily La Vanguardia
reported today. Dali severed all contact with his family years ago.
   Dali was a founder of the surrealist movement in the early 1930s
and he was the last of an outstanding generation of Spanish painters
that included Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro.
   A fervent Catalan, he returned to his native region in 1948 after
living in Madrid, Paris and several U.S. cities.
   An inscription beneath a statue outside the Theater-Museum quotes
Catalan philosopher Francesc Pujols: ``Catalan thought will always
grow anew and survive those who would foolishly bury it.''

   Jurors in the child-killing case against Joel
Steinberg weighed homicide charges against him, and two alternate
jurors who were dismissed said they would have voted for conviction.
   However, the alternates expressed mixed feelings about the
prosecution's star witness _ Steinberg's former live-in companion,
Hedda Nussbaum, whose testimony will likely determine the verdict.
   The jury received the case Monday and deliberated for about nine
hours without reaching a verdict. Deliberations resumed this morning.
   Of the five alternate jurors released by Judge Harold Rothwax,
some told reporters they believed Ms. Nussbaum testified truthfully,
others weren't sure and some thought she was covering up.
   Dr. Samuel Klagsbrun, Ms. Nussbaum's psychiatrist, said Monday
his patient ``will interpret any verdict except murder as, `They
didn't believe me.'
   ``If the jury shows any doubt she feels people will feel she is
responsible or somehow she participated in the crime, and that is a
hurt that she finds almost unbearable,'' he said.
   Steinberg is charged in the death of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg,
the girl he obtained at birth from an unwed Long Island teen-ager
and raised but never legally adopted.
   Lisa was removed comatose from Steinberg's Greenwich Village
apartment on Nov. 2, 1987, and taken to a hospital where she died of
a brain injury three days later.
   The case drew nationwide attention to the problem of child and
spousal abuse, especially to the responsibility of teachers,
neighbors and other adults who may suspect someone is a victim of
abuse.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, testified for the prosecution that Steinberg
told her in bed, after they free-based cocaine and while Lisa lay
comatose on their bathroom floor, that he had ``knocked Lisa down
and she didn't want to get up.''
   Steinberg's lawyers charge that Ms. Nussbaum beat the child to
death in a jealous rage, while prosecutors say Ms. Nussbaum was too
incapacitated from being abused by Steinberg to have been able to
inflict a fatal beating.
   If jurors decide Steinberg bears guilt in the child's death, they
must decide among four possible homicide counts: murder, first- or
second-degree manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide.
   One alternate juror who was dismissed Monday after she became ill
told reporters she would have voted to convict Steinberg of murder.
   The juror, Sharon Rupert, 50, was excused shortly before Rothwax
completed his final instructions to the jury. The other alternate
jurors were released shortly before the 12 regular jurors retired
for the night.
   ``I believed Hedda,'' said Ms. Rupert. ``I almost cried when she
left the witness stand.''
   Alternate Millie Sandoval, 31, when asked if she believed Ms.
Nussbaum's testimony, said: ``It's hard to say. I just feel that she
was just as much to blame. I don't think she should get away with
everything.''
   She refused to comment on whether she thought Steinberg should be
convicted. But when asked if she believed Steinberg ``did it,'' Ms.
Sandoval said ``I believe it could have been both of them.''
   Edna Massick, 34, said, ``I think Hedda was telling the partial
truth; I can't say I feel she was telling the complete truth. I
think she was covering for Joel. She is a very sick woman.''
   Asked if she thought Steinberg should be convicted, Ms. Massick
said: ``Definitely. I think he should have been convicted. I'm not
sure of what.''

<HEAD>Judge Sentences, Fines Six Ex-Klansmen In Decatur Clash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite pleas for leniency, six former Ku
Klux Klansmen were ordered to spend time in prison for helping to
disrupt a black protest march in Decatur almost 10 years ago.
   The lengthy case ended Monday when the six were sentenced and
fined by U.S. District Judge James H. Hancock after they told him
they had severed their Klan connections and were sorry for what they
had done.
   The 1979 clash came as blacks protested the arrest of a black
Decatur man, Tommy Lee Hines, who was charged with raping three
white women in 1978.
   Hines was convicted of one of the rapes and sent to prison. The
Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals later ruled that he was mentally
incompetent, and he was moved to a mental hospital in Tuscaloosa.
   The protest march ended in a gunfight and brawl with Klansmen,
with several marchers and policemen injured.
   Attorneys for the six had sought probation or community service
instead of prison terms.
   Three other ex-Klansmen also charged in the clash were sentenced
previously, one on his guilty plea and two on their convictions.
   Hancock gave the stiffest penalties to Ray W. Steele of Decatur
and William D. Riccio of Birmingham, who pleaded guilty to
misdemeanor charges of violating the marchers' civil rights by
conspiring to disrupt the march, and to two felony charges of
conspiring to obstruct an FBI investigation.
   Each was sentenced to terms of one and two years, to be served
concurrently, and each was fined $1,000.
   On guilty pleas to conspiring to disrupt the march, Roger D.
Handley of Warrior was sentenced to four months and fined $600;
William J. Mason and Lenwood L. White, both of Muscle Shoals, were
sentenced to three months and fined $500; and Terry J. Tucker of
Cullman was sentenced to two months and fined $400.
   ``I made a mistake,'' White said. ``I have to pay the price.
It'll never happen again.''
   Riccio told the judge that ``I guess I was hardheaded for a long
time. I butted my head against the wall and got wore down. I will
not let this court down if given the opportunity to prove I am a
changed person.''

<HEAD>Prince Charles Pays Belated Royal Visit To Lockerbie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles came to Lockerbie today
to comfort the bereaved and mend fences with townspeople aggrieved
by the royal family's behavior after the crash of Pan Am Flight 103.
   The visit by the heir to the British throne was seen as a tacit
admission by the royal family that it bungled its response to the
Dec. 21 tragedy, first through an inept remark by Charles' younger
brother Prince Andrew, and then by staying away from a memorial
service for the victims.
   Charles, who arrived by train for a 90-minute visit that
stretched to 2{ hours, got a friendly welcome and several residents
said they felt mollified by his trip.
   All 259 people aboard the New York-bound Boeing 747 were killed,
along with 11 residents of this rural town, when a bomb blew up the
jet.
   Andrew, who visited the day after the crash, got into trouble
when he appeared to voice more concern for the Americans on the
plane than the Britons on the ground.
   ``It's very sad for the town, but my deepest feelings go out to
the people, the families of those Americans who died in the crash,''
he told reporters.
   Media reaction was scathing when the royals stayed away from a
memorial service Jan. 4 in Lockerbie attended by relatives of the
families, Pan Am staff and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The royals sent local representatives, and Buckingham Palace said
it was not customary for Queen Elizabeth II to attend such events.
But the palace then announced the queen's husband, Prince Philip,
would attend the funeral of Emperor Hirohito of Japan.
   Thousands of British war prisoners died at the hands of the
Japanese during World War II, and many Britons regarded Hirohito as
a war criminal.
   ``The fact that a member of the royal family is going to Japan to
the funeral of a man who caused so much suffering, when they could
not come to a memorial service in their own country, must have some
effect locally,'' said Robert Jardine, vice chairman of the
Lockerbie and District Community Council.
   Charles met with bereaved families, inspected the crater caused
by the falling wreckage, toured damaged homes and laid a wreath
outside the town hall.
   He also met with rescue officials, shook hands with townspeople
and stopped for a quick drink and friendly banter at a local pub.
   ``I think it's helped out,'' said Anne McPhail, a Lockerbie
resident. ``I wondered about it myself. I thought it was a bit late
in the day but now I feel better about it.''
   Said store manager Robert Devlin: ``It says a lot for him that he
had the courage to come. It is a great honor.''
   Trucker Niven Milligan said: ``I am pleased that the prince has
come to make amends for his brother.''
   The physical impact of the crash is still evident. Southbound
lanes remain closed on the main highway alongside the crater. Nearby
are the burned-out shells of houses.
   The government has announced a grant of about $12.6 million to
pay for the search and rescue operations, police investigation and
counseling for the bereaved.

<HEAD>West African President Orders Troops To Shoot Rioters On Sight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COTONOU, Benin (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mathieu Kerekou ordered troops to
open fire on crowds following anti-government riots in the capital,
official reports said today.
   State radio broadcast Kerekou's order for soldiers ``to shoot
without warning on any group that forms and this throughout the
national territory.''
   In telephone calls, reporters at Benin's state news agency
confirmed that rioting broke out Monday night, but they refused to
give details.
   Demonstrators sacked several public buildings and burned
portraits of Kerekou, the French agency Agence France Presse
reported.
   Protesters chanted the name of Lt. Col. Francois Kouyami, said to
be one of the leaders of an attempted coup last year, said AFP.
Kouyami escaped from prison in November.
   Authorities have dispatched 300 extra troops to reinforce the
garrison in the capital, which is 20 miles east of Cotonou.
   Porto Novo was the scene of several incidents earlier this month
when teachers, unpaid for several weeks, went on strike to demand
their salaries. Unrest lasted a week, but the discontent has
continued.
   Kerekou has ruled since 1972, when he seized power in the tiny
West African nation's fifth coup since its independence from France
in 1960. The country used to be called Dahomey.

<HEAD>General Says Military Reductions Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two divisions of the Polish armed forces
will be eliminated this year, and two more will be reduced in
strength by 85 percent, according to reports in the state media.
   The Monday reports did not specify the number of troops involved,
but a Polish division is estimated to have about 12,000 soldiers.
   The news came on the same day East German leader Erich Honecker
announced his country will reduce its armed forces by 10,000 troops
and trim defense spending 10 percent by the end of 1990.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev announced in December he would
slash his country's armed forces by a half-million men, including
withdrawing 50,000 troops and officers from Poland, East Germany,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   Poland's state-run PAP news agency said communications systems
will be upgraded to compensate for the reduction in troop strength.
   Slowo Powszechne, the church daily, reported the government also
is considering reducing the two-year military service requirement
under Poland's draft system.
   Poland has the second-largest army in the Warsaw Pact military
alliance, behind the Soviet Union. It was estimated at 394,000
active troops and 491,000 reservists in 1987 by the London-based
International Institute for Strategic Studies.
   Poland reduced its forces by 15,000 troops during 1987-88,
liquidated two mechanized divisions and retired many older planes,
tanks and artillery pieces, Defense Minister Gen. Florian Siwicki
said earlier this month.
   In Brussels, a spokesman for NATO said today the Western alliance
was ``glad to hear'' of the East German plans, and would like to see
even more reductions in the East bloc's conventional forces.
   ``There is a great asymmetry in NATO-Warsaw Pact conventional
forces, and anything that reduces this imbalance is useful,'' said
Robin Stafford, a spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. ``But there is still a long way to go before a balance
at reduced level is achieved.
   ``This is the purpose of the talks about to begin in Vienna.''
   The 16 NATO nations are to begin negotiations March 9 with the
seven Warsaw Pact countries on reducing conventional arms in Europe.

   Ted Bundy's last hours provoked a final outpouring of anger and
hatred against the serial killer, along with puzzlement over what
turned a man of apparent charm and intelligence into what one
official called ``a living devil.''
   Across Florida and the West, families of Bundy's victims and law
enforcement officials who have spent years on his trail expressed
relief over his execution.
   ``Good,'' sighed Vivian Rancourt, mother of Bundy victim Susan
Rancourt, when reached at her LaConner, Wash., home shortly after
Bundy's execution in Starke, Fla. ``The only thing I can say is
thank God, it's finally over.''
   The father of another victim declined to comment this morning.
   ``It's too soon to really digest this,'' said Donald Blackburn of
Spokane, Wash., whose 23-year-old daughter, Janice Ott, disappeared
in July 1974. Bundy has confessed to her murder.
   ``I view him pretty much as a cancer that ... (has) to be
removed,'' Blackburn said earlier.
   ``It's hard to feel sympathy for a guy responsible for the deaths
of several dozen young women,'' said Florida State Attorney Jerry
Blair, who was one of three state attorneys to witness the execution.
   Mrs. Rancourt said she lay awake in bed this morning, waiting for
word about the fate of the man who killed her daughter.
   ``It's been a tough week,'' she said in a slow, quiet voice.
``I'm hoping that this will never be allowed to happen again. This
terrible wait. We won't have to hear any more stories of how he
played the system or his escapades.''
   Although about two dozen foes of capital punishment held a vigil
outside the Florida State Prison near Starke, their objections
focused on the morality of the death penalty, not on any possibility
of Bundy's innocence.
   And in contrast to some past Florida executions, such as that of
Willie Jasper Darden in March, those supporting Bundy's execution
were far more vocal than those who were opposed.
   ``Calls and letters are very, very favorable toward executing
this man as quickly as possible,'' said Brian Ballard, director of
operations for Florida Gov. Bob Martinez. ``I've heard ... of a few
against capital punishment, but we have not gotten one saying Ted
Bundy is innocent.''
   One relative of a suspected Bundy victim, who opposes capital
punishment, said his execution wouldn't make a difference.
   ``Killing Ted Bundy won't make me feel better ... and it won't
bring back Shelley,'' said Roberta Robertson, whose daughter,
Shelley Robertson, was last seen June 30, 1975. The nude body of the
24-year-old woman was found that August in a mine at the foot of
Berthoud Pass, Colo.
   ``A lot of people seem to want it out of vengeance. But it gives
people a false sense of security, and it's terribly expensive,''
said Robertson, of Arvada, Colo.
   The father of one victim expressed ambivalence about Bundy's
execution.
   ``It's not important to me now,'' said Robert Campbell of
Dearborn, Mich. ``The thing I'd like to have back, I can't have.''
   Bundy confessed Sunday to killing Campbell's daughter,
23-year-old Caryn Campbell, in Colorado in 1975.
   Other bereaved families, those whose loved ones' names were not
mentioned in any of Bundy's confessions, feared that the secret of
their daughters' and sisters' deaths would die with the killer.
   ``Mr. Bundy,'' wrote William Taylor of San Diego, whose sister
disappeared 21 years ago, ``if you could shed one ray of light on
this tragedy, my family's prayers would go with you to eternity.''
   Taylor also wrote Martinez, asking that Bundy be spared, at least
temporarily, so that authorities could study him for clues to the
makeup of serial killers.
   Bundy's mother, Louise Bundy of Tacoma, Wash., also groped for
clues Monday night, expressing anguish and confusion over her son's
killing sprees.
   ``It's a terrible thing,'' said Mrs. Bundy, who planned to spend
this morning with her family and minister. ``He wasn't raised that
way. He was raised in a good, loving, caring family. We still love
and care for him, but we want to know what caused this.''
   Asked if her son was mentally ill, she said, ``I think he must
be. He must be! How could anybody not be, and commit those crimes?''
   In Lake City, Fla., where Bundy abducted 12-year-old Kimberly
Leach in 1978, Mayor Gerald Witt said the killer's execution would
``give everybody a feeling of relief, and make everybody smile.''
   ``He's destroyed so many lives,'' said Witt. ``It seems like he's
just a living devil.''
   The parents of the Lake City girl whose kidnapping, rape and
murder led Bundy to the electric chair, kept their thoughts about
the execution to themselves. But state Trooper Ken Robinson _ who
found her body in 1978 in an abandoned hog shed _ said he believed
the Leaches would be relieved.
   ``It has hung over them all this time,'' said Robinson, who
witnessed the execution. ``We'll all be better off when this is
history.
   ``There was no remorse about watching him,'' he added. ``I
thought back and I felt like justice has been done. But I wonder if
he really went through as much suffering as ... (Kimberly) did?''

   A chronic shortage of contraceptives contributes to
the Soviet Union's estimated 6.5 million abortions a year _ a number
about equal to annual births, the highest-ranking woman in the
Kremlin says.
   ``Our complaints from women are completely well-founded
concerning the number of abortions compared to the use of
contraceptives,'' Deputy Premier Alexandra Biryukova told a news
conference on Monday.
   ``It is not normal when the number of abortions is about equal to
the number of births,'' she said.
   In her comments, the non-voting member of the ruling Communist
Party Politburo addressed an issue that until recently would not be
discussed by the official Soviet media, much less by a senior
official.
   But in the past two years as society has begun to discuss openly
many of the social problems it kept hidden for decades, women have
protested the lack of contraceptives and sex education, and the
humiliation they say they face when they seek an abortion.
   Abortion is used instead of contraceptives as the main means of
birth control in the Soviet Union, and Western experts estimate the
average Soviet woman has nine abortions.
   The Health Ministry newspaper Meditsinskaya Gazeta, commenting on
a critical shortage of condoms, said some couples were so desperate
they had turned to using children's balloons.
   ``The first thing we have to do is increase production of
contraceptives,'' Mrs. Biryukova said. ``We have to improve
conditions in hospitals.''
   The latest salvo against the medical profession came in an
article published in the weekend edition of the newspaper Moscow
News.
   Yekaterina Nikolayeva wrote about standing in line at the door of
a hospital operating room one recent morning, waiting for her
abortion.
   ``What are you waiting for? Come on, don't stare,'' she quoted
the doctor as saying, taking off a pair of blood-stained rubber
gloves as she entered.
   ``My hands started to shake, I felt scared, hurt and on the verge
of tears,'' she continued. ```Hurry up, you! I'm sick and tired of
your stupidity!' the doctor spurred me on.''
   After the abortion the doctors left for the day without checking
on her, and she finally left on her own in a nightgown and robe, she
said.
   Mrs. Biryukova said 600 to 700 women die every year as the result
of abortions in the Russian republic, the largest of the Soviet
Union's 15 republics.
   She said 90 percent of all first pregnancies end in abortion, and
that 6.5 million abortions are performed annually in the Soviet
Union.
   She did note cite a source for the figures, but if they are
accurate they would indicate there are about 900,000 more abortions
a year in the Soviet Union than live births. A Soviet statistical
reference says there were 5.6 million births in 1986.
   Mrs. Biryukova said she had read the Moscow News article and had
asked Health Minister Yevgeny Chazov and Moscow officials to
investigate the complaints.
   She said the leadership was committed to improving health care,
and had allocated an extra $12.8 billion during the current
five-year economic plan.
   Moscow News also asked Vladimir Alexeyev, head of the Mother and
Child Care Department of the Health Ministry about Ms. Nikolayeva's
complaints. It quoted Alexeyev as saying many kinds of
contraceptives are available, but that the level of sex education is
so low that women don't know about them.
   The ministry tried to organize educational radio and television
programs, but the public was scandalized by them, he said.

   The nation made no progress in reducing
economic disparities between blacks and whites during the Reagan
years, and blacks face increasing misery from poverty, crime and
drugs, the National Urban League reported today.
   The report, ``The State of Black America, 1989,'' is the
organization's 14th annual assessment of the status and conditions
of blacks in America.
   ``The new Bush administration will need a clear understanding of
the large magnitude of the problem of economic disparities as a
precondition to finding effective remedies,'' David H. Swinton said
in the report's summary of economic conditions.
   ``No progress has been made in reducing the longstanding economic
disparities faced by blacks during the Reagan administration,''
Swinton, dean of the business school at Jackson State University in
Mississippi, wrote. ``In fact, racial inequality in American life
actually increased by many of the standard indicators.''
   At a news conference releasing the report, John E. Jacob,
president of the National Urban League, said he was encouraged by
President Bush's selections of what he called a ``very centrist
Cabinet.'' He called on Bush to establish as a goal moving black
Americans toward economic parity with whites.
   ``We call for a decade-long massive effort,'' Jacob said. ``That
effort would amount to a national investment in the future.''
   In a grim assessment of the outlook for black children in
America, Marian Wright Edelman wrote that compared with 1980, black
children are more likely to be born into poverty, lack early
prenatal care, have a single mother, have an unemployed parent, and
not go to college.
   A black baby is three times as likely as a white baby to be born
to a mother who has had no prenatal care, and is more than twice as
likely to die during the first year, she said. A black male teenager
is six times as likely as a white male teenager to be a victim of
homicide, she said.
   ``Millions of black children today live in a desolate world where
physical survival is a triumph, where fear and hopelessness reign,
and where the future holds no promises and few opportunities,'' said
Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund.
   In another section, the report said the number of blacks enrolled
in four-year colleges has declined since 1980, while other minority
groups showed increases.
   The report said black families experienced ``sharp social and
economic setbacks during the 1970s and 1980s,'' after unprecedented
gains during the 1960s.
   It said the poverty rate for black families in 1987 was higher,
at 30 percent, than the rate in 1969, 28 percent. The number of
black families in poverty was up 700,000, it said. Three times more
blacks were unemployed in 1988 than in 1969, the report said.
   The report cited increases in the proportion of female-headed
black families over two decades and ``a shrinking in the size of the
black middle-class since 1978.''
   Increases in use of drugs, drug-related crime and gang violence
have destabilized many black families and caused homicide rates
among blacks to reach record levels, according to a chapter written
by Robert B. Hill, a consultant to the league.
   ``The disproportionate surge in deaths among blacks has resulted
in the first declines in black life expectancy since 1962,'' Hill
wrote.
   He said life expectancy at birth rose among whites from 75.3 to
75.4 years between 1984 and 1986, but for blacks the corresponding
figures declined from 69.7 to 69.4 years.
   The report also said black families have been
``disproportionately devastated'' by the declining stock of
affordable housing.
   ``Blacks are overrepresented among the thousands of families and
children living in welfare hotels and shelters for the homeless,''
he said.

   Authorities tightened security at
Zurich's international airport after a warning that terrorists may
launch attacks on U.S. or British targets from Switzerland, police
said today.
   In a separate incident, a New York-bound Air India passenger jet
was diverted to Ireland after a bomb threat.
   The Swiss alert said a terrorist group carrying Lebanese
passports was traveling around Europe and planned attacks on
unidentified American or British targets that could take place in
Switzerland or be launched from there, Zurich police spokesman Jan
Karbe said.
   ``We must take the alert seriously and we are doing so,'' said
Zurich airport spokesman Peter Gutknecht.
   Airport officials ordered ``adjustments in tactics and
personnel'' for the entire airport Saturday morning, Karbe said
without elaboration.
   He said the warning, received by Zurich airport authorities
Friday, was part of routine international exchanges of information
between airports, law enforcement agencies and airlines.
   On Monday, an Air India jumbo jet carrying 279 passengers was
recalled one hour and 15 minutes after it took off from London's
Heathrow Airport.
   Flight 111, which was over the Atlantic Ocean off Ireland's west
coast, diverted to Shannon International Airport.
   A spokesman for Aer Lingus, the handlers for Air India at
Shannon, said baggage was left in the airplane's hold until the time
the jet originally was scheduled to land in New York, in case a bomb
attached to a timer was on board.
   A search produced no explosives, he said.
   ``The hoax was a sick and disgusting joke,'' said Evelyn
Cooperstock of New Haven, Conn. She was among passengers who
reboarded the plane today after it was cleared for the
trans-Atlantic flight.
   On Dec. 21, a bomb blew up a Pan Am jet bound for New York,
killing all 259 on board and 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie,
Scotland.

<TEXT>
   Six former U.S. Marines
completed their 10-day tour of Vietnam today, making one of their
last stops at an orphanage where they were serenaded with
traditional Vietnamese songs.
   ``The World Belongs to the Children,'' a chorus of girls sang.
   Gene Spanos, a 39-year-old police lieutenant, was struck by the
poverty and gave the orphanage $40 on behalf of the Marines. He also
gave one of the boys a cap of the Chicago Bears football team.
William Johnson, 41, gave another boy a St. Christopher medal.
   The Marines were to leave Ho Chi Minh City for Bangkok, Thailand,
en route back to the United States, where they will report their
findings to government authorities.
   They pronounced a success their goodwill visit, in which they
called attention to the dangers of unexploded shells and mines in
central Vietnam.
   The ex-Marines had walked the battlefields and seen children
trying to dig up shell casings buried in the red dirt of former U.S.
bases. They heard reports of continuing casualties from the shells
and mines.
   Five of the men are former members of the 11th Marines, an
engineer battalion that planted 100,000 land mines in the region to
protect American bases more than 20 years ago.
   The Marines had returned on their own to determine whether the
mines and unexploded shells had been removed. They came as tourists
but were given VIP treatment, staying at a government guest house in
Dongha.
   In Hanoi, they met with Nguyen Can, deputy director of the
Foreign Ministry's North American Department, followed by dinner
with the official.
   The former Marines presented their findings to Can, who said he
would relay the information to the proper authorities.
   Robert Dalton, a 54-year-old freelance writer from Davidsonville,
Md., said Can brought up the issue of establishing diplomatic
relations with the United States.
   Vietnam badly wants diplomatic relations, which likely would mean
U.S. economic aid and the lifting of an American trade embargo. To
this end, it has been opening its doors wide to American visitors.
   ``They talked about some things that shouldn't have been talked
about in the meetings,'' Dalton said of the Vietnamese. ``But it
worked out good because they accepted our findings.''
   Spanos, from Rosemont, Ill. and the trip's organizer, described
it as a ``huge success.''
   ``We've accomplished a couple of things,'' he said. ``We've shown
the Vietnamese that in the north there is a problem in the central
area and they appreciate it.''
   He added, ``If they want Vietnam veterans to come back here as
tourists, many of the Marines that served up in those areas are
going to want to go up in those areas and we want it to be safe.''
   For the former Marines, it was a journey into the past, to renew
their youth and to pause on the battlefields to unfurl the Stars and
Stripes and honor their fallen comrades.
   ``I think I lost about 20 pounds of emotional baggage I never
knew I was carrying around,'' said Nate Genna, a 41-year-old
maintenance worker from Boston.
   Frank Noe, a 40-year-old firefighter from Stoughton, Mass., said,
``We had a chance to do some good in this world. Not only that, to
come back to a place where we grew up, where we became men.''

   Jesse Jackson today endorsed Mayor Eugene Sawyer's
bid for the city's Democratic mayoral nomination, saying Sawyer
``has earned our support.''
   The endorsement came just hours after Sawyer's leading black
challenger, Alderman Timothy Evans, submitted 100,000 petition
signatures in a third-party bid.
   Evans' move was an attempt to avoid a split in the black primary
vote that would give an edge to the leading white Democratic
candidate, Richard M. Daley, son of the city's longtime former mayor.
   Unless his petitions are challenged, Evans will bypass the city's
Feb. 28 Democratic mayoral primary and run under the banner of his
own party, which he dubbed the Harold Washington party, in the April
4 special election to fill the remaining two years of Washington's
term.
   Washington, the city's first black mayor, died from a heart
attack in November 1987. Evans was Washington's floor leader in the
City Council, but the aldermen selected Sawyer, who also is black,
to succeed Washington until the special election could be held.
   Jackson said today that a primary victory by Sawyer ``will show
our strong resolve to go forward in unity with a multiracial
coalition of workers ... determined to conquer the present odds.''
   As he filed his petitions, Evans pledged to reform the city's
political scene, especially what he called the remnants of the
``machine'' of late Mayor Richard J. Daley, who died 12 years ago.
   Evans also announced a drive to sign up an estimated 150,000
unregistered black voters. The drive, if successful, could benefit
Sawyer, but Evans' handlers believe the mayor won't survive the
primary.
   ``We don't particularly care who it helps in the primary. We want
to make sure people are registered to vote,'' Evans spokeswoman
Sharon Jenkins-Brown said. ``If ancillary effects fall to Sawyer,
more power to him.''
   Over the weekend, Sawyer got endorsements from several
influential black leaders, including a former political foe,
Alderman Danny Davis. Davis, however, said his endorsement is only
for the primary.

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed an Arab youth
in a pre-dawn raid on a West Bank village today, and the military
announced that security agents had arrested dozens of members of an
underground ``army.''
   Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, who for 23 years has championed
unity in this mixed Arab and Jewish city, announced he is running
for a sixth term.
   ``This is a united city and will remain a united city, with equal
rights to Arabs,'' said the 77-year-old mayor, who faces opposition
on the City Council from ultra-Orthodox and right-wing elements that
control almost half the 31 seats.
   The raid on Habla adhered to the army policy of disrupting
nationalistic activities on days of general strikes called by
leaders of the 13-month Palestinian uprising.
   Today's strike, called to protest harsh new army tactics for
quelling the revolt, closed down shops in the West Bank and Arab
east Jerusalem and paralyzed commerce in the Gaza Strip, where the
army confined at least 200,000 Arabs to their homes.
   The Shin Bet security service arrested dozens of Arabs suspected
of belonging to the ``Palestinian Popular Army'', the military
command announced today. Officials said the group was led by Yasser
Arafat's mainstream Fatah branch of the PLO.
   Israel radio said the main suspect apprehended, Abdel Fatah
Hassan of the West Bank town of Nablus, received weapons and money
from Fatah and trained dozens of youths for attacks against Israelis
as part of the uprising against Israel's 21-year occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza.
   The radio did not mention what type or quantity of weapons were
seized and a military spokesman said he was unable to provide
details.
   Hassan also possessed special badges for his squads, which were
due to train ``hundreds of others'' in the West Bank, the report
said. No further details were released, including when the arrests
were made.
   It was not immediately clear how seriously the wave of arrests
had debilitated the group. Palestine Liberation Organization
statements have said such a group was being formed under the
auspices of Force-17, a Fatah unit, and had thousands of members in
the occupied territories.
   The organization issued its first leaflet last week, describing
itself as ``an inseparable unit of other military Palestinian forces
in the diaspora'' under Arafat's leadership.
   Palestinian observers have said the organization was formed in an
apparent attempt to unite loosely organized groups of youths who
enforce strikes and attack collaborators.
   Before the Shin Bet crackdown, there was little indication
organized or armed units existed in the occupied lands.
   The soldiers who raided Habla, which is near Qalqilya,
encountered a squad of masked Arabs and killed one of them after the
Arabs ignored orders to halt, military officials said.
   Another Palestinian was wounded, and four managed to escape.
   The dead youth was identified by his family as Issam Hashem
el-Marabi, 19. Arab reports earlier had said the victim was
17-year-old Khaled Mardawi, but he later was reported recovering
from a wound in his left leg at an Israeli hospital in the city of
Kfar Saba.
   The death raised to 368 the number of Palestinians killed since
the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987. Fifteen Israelis have also been
killed.
   The PLO-linked Unified National Leadership of the Uprising called
today's strike to protest the policy announced by the military last
week of demolishing homes of stone-throwers and Arabs convicted of
violent acts against Israel.
   In an underground leaflet distributed Monday, the leadership also
decried a new army policy that allows officers and specially trained
troops to shoot plastic-tipped bullets at fleeing stone-throwers and
Arabs who set up barricades.
   Previous regulations gave officers permission to fire the bullets
only in life-threatening situations or to incapacitate leaders of
demonstrations.
   At least 47 Arabs have been killed and 288 wounded by the
plastic-tipped bullets, said chief army spokesman Brig. Gen. Ephraim
Lapid.
   Speaking on Israel Television's Arabic-language service, Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir defended the orders.
   ``Nobody is happy about the fact that there are wounded,'' he
said. ``But a war has been forced on us. It's not only a war against
Israel's presence in certain areas of the country. It's a war
against our existence.''

   A neighbor of six people who died in a
house fire last week has been arrested and charged with six counts
of second-degree murder, becoming the fourth man charged in the
case, police said.
   Danny Hyler, 22, who lived across the street from the victims,
was questioned and arrested over the weekend about the deaths but
was released Sunday. He was rearrested and charged Monday.
   He and three other men were being held in lieu of $1 million bail
each.
   A suspected drug dealer who had been arrested following a
disturbance Thursday night paid two men $75 each to start the house
fire early Friday, police said. Officers would not say which of the
men made the alleged payment.
   Six other people who were in the house in midtown Kansas City
escaped, but two were injured.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
bowed to budget concerns today and recommended the Namibia
peacekeeping force be cut to 4,650 troops.
   It is expected to be the United Nations' costliest mission.
   Black African nations and non-aligned countries have argued for
weeks with the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and
China over the size and cost of the force.
   It will oversee Namibia's transition from South African rule to
independence, which is to begin April 1.
   The Organization of African Unity and non-aligned countries
insisted that at least 7,500 troops be dispatched, as provided for
in the original 1978 U.N. Security Council plan for the territory.
   But the United States and the other permanent members of the
Security Council, which together pay 58 percent of peacekeeping
costs, objected to the estimated $700 million cost of sending that
many troops.
   The United States proposed sending about 3,200 peacekeepers to
the territory, which has also been known as South-West Africa.
   In his recommendations to the Security Council, released today,
Perez de Cuellar kept the upper limit of the peacekeeping contingent
at 7,500, but said only 4,650 would be dispatched at a cost of about
$416 million. The remaining troops will be held in readiness in
their home countries in case they are needed, he said.
   All U.N. peacekeeping operations in 1988 cost about $375 million.
The most expensive was the 1960-64 Congo peacekeeping mission, which
cost more than $400 million, at much higher dollar rates, and
involved 19,828 soldiers.
   The Security Council must vote on Perez de Cuellar's
recommendations and is expected to approve them.
   Elections for a Namibian assembly are to be held in November. The
assembly will draft a constitution and organize a black-majority
ruled government, ending South Africa's 74-year rule over Namibia.
   A force of 500 police drawn from U.N. member nations will be sent
to supervise the Namibian police, who will still be responsible for
law and order during the transition to independence.

<HEAD>Malaysian Prime Minister Undergoes Heart Bypass Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
underwent successful coronary bypass surgery Tuesday at the Kuala
Lumpur Government Hospital, officials said.
   Doctors decided on surgery after conducting tests on the
63-year-old prime minister, who was admitted to Kuala Lumpur
Government Hospital on Jan. 18 after complaining of chest pains,
according to Dr. C. Fonseka, the hospital director.
   Mahathir's condition was stable, according to a statement
released through the national news agency Bernama.
   Officials at the Prime Minister's Department, speaking on
condition of anonymity, confirmed the Bernama report.
   Mahathir had suffered from minor blood presure problems, but this
was the first time he had complained of chest pains, friends and
relatives said.
   In 1981, Mahathir succeeded Hussein Onn to become Malaysia's
fourth prime minister since its independence from Britain in 1957.
   Mahathir is president of the United Malays National Organization,
which rules in a coalition with 12 other Chinese and Indian parties.
   Two years ago, his former deputy prime minister, Musa Hitam, and
finance minister, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, joined forces to try to
oust Mahathir. Maneuvering within the party is continuing, but
politicians and Western diplomats say Mahathir does not appear
likely to be ousted anytime soon.
   Mahathir, a physician trained in Western medicine, graduated from
the University of Singapore in 1957.

<TEXT>
   More than half the seagulls of Ioannina
Lake in northwestern Greece have died and are washing ashore by the
hundreds, the Greek Ornithological Society said Tuesday.
   A spokesman for the society said pesticides used by farmers
probably are to blame.
   About 500 dead seagulls had been found and 500 more were expected
to wash up, said the spokesman, Martin Gaethlich. The seagull
population of the lake is estimated at between 1,500 and 2,000.
   The Ioannina Veterinary Laboratory said the dead birds showed no
sign of disease, and poisoning was being investigated.
   Gaethlich said other species of birds feeding from the lake,
including crows, remained healthy.
   Ioannina Lake, about seven miles long and two miles wide, is one
of the most beautiful natural sites in Greece.
   ``Pesticides are the only remaining possibility. Farmers use them
along with herbicides right after plowing and seagulls follow the
tractors to feed from the ground,'' Gaethlich said.
   Farmers started plowing early because of warm weather but a lack
of rainfall ``didn't help the toxic substances dissolve,'' he said.

<HEAD>Arianespace to Order 50 Launch Vehicles From Partners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arianespace, Europe's commerical space transport
company, plans to order 50 Ariane-4 launch vehicles worth about $3
billion from its industrial partners next month, it was announced
Tuesday.
   The Ariane-4 rockets will be used to put satellites into orbit
between 1991 and 1999.
   France's state-owned Aerospatiale SA is one of the major partners
in the Ariane-4 project with a 20.4 percent share. Other major
partners include state-controlled Societe Europeenne de Propulsion
and Matra SA with shares of 21.1 percent and 8.7 percent
respectively, and MAN and ERNO of West Germany with 9.3 percent and
5.1 percent respectively.
   Smaller contractors include British Aerospace and Ferranti of
Britain, Volvo AB of Sweden, Air Liquide of France, Fabrique
Nationale of Belgium, SNIA and Aeritalia of Italy, Fokker of the
Netherlands and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.
   Arianespace officials estimate that by ordering 50 rockets at
once, the consortium will be able to reduce its prices by 20 percent.
   The cost of an Araine-4 launch would be reduced to between $90
million and $100 million, making the vehicle competitive with other
launchers operating in the 1990s, said Arianespace Chairman
Frederick d'Allest.
   The Ariane-4, which can put a 4.2-ton payload into orbit, made
its first flight at the end of last year.
   D'Allest said 1988 had been a good year for Arianespace, with net
income of about $17 million on revenue of $612 million.
   He said the consortium is consolidating its 50 percent share of
the world satellite launch market and said Arianespace's schedule
for this year includes contracts for nine launches, most of which
will be Ariane-4s.
   D'Allest expressed concern about the entry of the Chinese into
the world market with their Long March rockets. The Chinese began
offering to put satellites in orbit for between $20 million and $25
million, he said, but they have now agreed to make their prices more
realistic.

<HEAD>State of Emergency Extended For Six Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state of emergency was extended by
Parliament for six months on Tuesday because of possible threats
from South Africa and border raids by rebels from Mozambique, the
government said.
   Home Affairs Minister Moven Mahachi told legislators that 93
Zimbabweans were slain by Mozambican rebels in 420 border raids in
the last six months from July 13.
   Right-wing Mozambique National Resistance guerrillas mounted six
attacks against troops inside Zimbabwe and were blamed for 32 armed
robberies and 139 abductions in the same period, Mahachi said.
   He said the rebels ``continue to direct their attacks against the
unarmed local population'' and burned and plundered stores, schools,
clinics and commerical and farming centers.
   Mahachi cited sabotage and infiltration by agents of the South
African government as a threat to national security.
   South Africa has mounted several attacks on facilities in
Zimbabwe of the African National Congress, the main guerrilla
organization fighting the government in Pretoria.
   Zimbabwe has been under a state of emergency since 1965, when it
was introduced by former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith's
government to crack down on black nationalists. The emergency, which
has been renewed by Parliament every six months since independence
in 1980, allows for detention without trial.
   The latest extension was endorsed by 62 legislators present in
the 100-seat House of Assembly in Harare.
   Some legislators called on the government to urge Mozambican
authorities to hold talks with guerrilla leaders aimed at ending the
11-year conflict in Mozambique.

   The Rwandan government marked the start of

sentences and reducing prison terms for inmates sentenced before
Jan. 8, Radio Kigali said Tuesday.
   The amnesty excludes those convicted of offenses against the

state-owned radio said in a broadcast monitored in Nairobi.
   The government also freed all prisoners serving five-year prison
terms, and all women and those under 18 sentenced to 20 years in
jail.
   The decree reduced life sentences to 20 years and death sentences
to life. The radio did not say how many prisoners were affected.
   Habyarimana was elected to a third five-year term in December.

<HEAD>Soviet Donates Stamp Collection to Help Save Cathedral Map</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet man has donated his stamp collection to
help save the Mappa Mundi, a 13th century map that financially
troubled Hereford Cathedral says it may have to sell, church
officials said Tuesday.
   Alexei Petrov gave his stamps to a Hereford businessman attending
a Moscow exhibition in December, along with a letter to Hereford's
bishop, the Right Rev. John Eastaugh, saying he had read of the
cathedral's plight in a Soviet newspaper.
   ``I first thought of sending a sum of money _ which is next to
impossible from here,'' Petrov wrote in the letter delivered to the
cathedral by businessman John Bone.
   ``As a way out of the predicament I remembered my small stamp
collection, which incidentally is connected with maps.
   ``I thought it might raise a couple of pounds at a jumble
(rummage) sale and thus help you in your almost impossible task of
raising more than 7 million pounds ($12.4 million),'' the sum the
cathedral says it needs, he wrote. ``Let it be my humble Christian
and Christmas gift to the Church of England for saving Mappa Mundi.''
   Petrov's album contains more than 100 stamps depicting maps of
various countries. A cathedral spokeswoman said the value of the
collection was not known.
   Petrov gave the collection to Bone in December and it arrived at
the 900-year-old cathedral in western England in early January, she
said.
   ``This is an unexpected and wonderful gesture,'' the bishop said.
``I have written a letter of thanks to Mr. Petrov and sent him a
copy of the Mappa Mundi.''
   The cathedral decided last fall to sell the Mappa Mundi unless it
raised money to pay off debts and make repairs.
   The map, one of Europe's greatest medieval treasures, is due to
be sold at Sotheby's auction house in June.

   Japan will launch a five-year project to develop a

in operation, an official said Tuesday.
   Tasuku Hirahara of the Transport Ministry's Technology Division

still is subject to approval by parliament.
   The vessel would have a speed of more than 58 mph, compared with
the average speed of 23 mph of current container vessels, Hirahara
said.
   The new vessel, about 330 feet long and capable of carrying more
than 1,000 tons, could travel to the United States in about three
days, or about half the time now needed for ocean crossings, he
added.
   The first of the new commercial liners, needing fewer than 10
crew members, would be operating before the end of this century,
Hirahara said.

<HEAD>Ungaro Takes Bold Approach For Spring, Summer</HEAD>

   Emanuel Ungaro on Tuesday presented a sumptuous
collection for spring and summer, softening his structured look in
defiance of the sweet and pretty trend dominating French haute
couture.
   Ungaro all but ignored pleats and wide, breezy pants and
minimized the draping he has used lavishly in earlier shows.
   Midway through France's high fashion week, he showed well-defined
lines, bold colors and lots of glitter.
   Ungaro also had a bold approach to the flowers that have sprung
up everywhere for spring and summer.
   Mixing colors generously, he played dramatic floral prints on
jackets and tops against small flower prints on the dresses or pants
underneath. In one outfit, a black checked jacket was paired with a
floral-print dress.
   Soft notes included petticoats under flouncy skirts and cinched
waists, and lots of silky fabric.
   There were a few examples of what is becoming the classic soft
look for summer, including a gauzy white floor-length dress with
halter top and draped bodice, set off with a gold medallion and gold
lame at the midriff.
   Jackets, long or short but all with tightly cinched waists, often
were ruffled at the shoulder-top for a swept-up wing effect
reminiscent of royalty. The softness came when the jacket was
removed to reveal a pretty strapless, flowery dress.
   Ungaro used gold and silver extensively, in brocade or weaved
into the fabric.
   Pants were soft and most were tailored with thin legs and worn
under jackets or in pants suits.
   Hemlines were above the knee, but jacket lengths varied from just
below the waist to dress length and beyond.
   Pierre Cardin, showing Monday, solved the problem of hemlines
with soaring splits, sometimes in the front and back, in what has
been dubbed the ``long-short.'' In variations of the look, he
covered minis with long flowing wraps or tight sheaths with
cloak-like jackets.
   Balmain excelled in suits, and Nina Ricci turned out beautiful
summer evening dresses. Christian Dior went to the sari to achieve
the draped look so prevalent this week.
   Cardin also refused to abandon the structured shoulder for day
wear, replacing pads in suit jackets with little front tucks,
sometimes bowed, that tend to square off and extend the shoulder
without exaggerated padding.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer seemed to luxuriate in pants and pleats,
showing pants suits for day and evening, often dressed up with lace
or embroidery.

<HEAD>Prince Charles' Visit Soothes Lockerbie</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles, bringing condolences
five weeks after the crash of Pan Am Flight 103, gave an extra hour
Tuesday to a town that felt snubbed by the royal family in its time
of grief.
   The heir to the throne listened and talked to relatives of the 11
people killed in Lockerbie Dec. 21 and laid an elaborate floral
tribute at the town hall. He charmed children and paused for a
whiskey before leaving more than an hour behind schedule _ but with
new admirers.
   ``It says a lot for him that he had the courage to come. It is a
great honor,'' said store manager Robert Devlin.
   ``I thought it was a bit late in the day'' for Charles' visit,
said Anne McPhail, whose neighbors' houses are in ruins, ``but now I
feel better about it. You see, we all make mistakes. You can always
rectify them, can't you?''
   Charles visited the crater gouged by the falling Boeing 747 in
the Sherwood Crescent neighborhood, where all of Lockerbie's victims
lived.
   The bomb that brought down Flight 103 also killed all 259 aboard.
Searchers found 242 bodies of which all but two have been identified.
   Charles' visit with the families, scheduled to last 20 minutes,
stretched longer than an hour as he met with them in groups of 10 or
fewer, guided by the town's three clergymen.
   ``It was a very worthwhile visit, and I think everyone is much
the better for it,'' said the Rev. James Annand, the local Church of
Scotland minister.
   ``It shows the value of having a monarchy,'' he said.
   The monarchy, however, had appeared to stumble over Lockerbie.
   Charles' brother Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, had come to
Lockerbie the day after the crash, but offended some with remarks
that seemed to show him more concerned about the American bereaved
than those of Lockerbie.
   ``I am pleased that the prince has come to make amends for his
brother,'' Trucker Niven Milligan said as Charles toured Lockerbie.
   On Jan. 4, when the royals stayed away from a memorial service in
Lockerbie attended by relatives of the families, Pan Am staff and
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the press was scathing.
   The royals sent local representatives, and Buckingham Palace said
it was not customary for Queen Elizabeth II to attend such events in
person. But then, to the anger of some Lockerbie residents, the
palace announced that the queen's husband, Prince Philip, would fly
to Japan for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
   Charles' visit appeared to soothe feelings in the Scottish market
town. He was cheered as his limousine pulled up in front of town
hall.
   He strolled to the police barricade to chat with onlookers,
including pupils from Lockerbie Primary School who had noisily but
patiently waited in a cold wind for his arrival.
   The prince's path back to the rail station and his train passed
the Black Bull pub, where landlady Joan Jamieson invited him in.
   Charles, 40, vaulted over a barricade and accepted a free glass
of malt whiskey.
   Mrs. Jamieson asked if she could now formally declare her pub to
be patronized by royalty.
   ``That will take three years of good service,'' Charles said.
``But I'm willing to try it.''
   ``The visit, in my own feeling, was timed to perfection,'' said
the Rev. Alan Neal, the local Anglican priest. ``People are now
beginning to think a little bit ahead.''

<TEXT>
   The future of one of the last tracts of
virgin forest in Appalachia is at stake in a lawsuit in which a
former owner argues the state should give the land back because it
isn't taking proper care of the historic relic.
   The oldest trees in the 550-acre Lilley Cornett Woods, 15 miles
west of Whitesburg in rugged eastern Kentucky, predate the Pilgrims'
landing in 1620.
   ``It's the last remnant of any size that's preserved in Kentucky
of the pre-settlement forest,'' said William H. Martin, an Eastern
Kentucky University official who oversees the site, including 252
acres of oak, walnut, chestnut and hickory that have never been
logged or used for grazing.
   ``That's it,'' Martin said. ``We're talking about 252 acres out
of 25 million originally in Kentucky.''
   Martin and the university are among the officials and state
agencies who are defendants in a lawsuit filed last year by a son of
Lilley Cornett, the man for whom the woods are named. The lawsuit
seeks to return ownership of the property to the son, Dock Cornett.
   The elder Cornett bought the land in 1918 and protected the woods
from outside encroachment for several decades. He willed the small
forest to his sons, who sold it to the state for $270,000 in 1968 on
the condition that it be preserved as a ``living museum.''
   Dock Cornett, 68, contends the state has failed to live up to
that obligation.
   He said the state and EKU have built a dam, cut timber, torn down
historic log structures dating from the 1800s and erected research
stations, all in violation of restrictions in the 1968 deed. The
university took over administration of the forest in 1977.
   A Letcher Circuit Court judge is expected to rule next month on
whether the lawsuit should be dismissed on grounds of governmental
immunity. If the case is allowed to proceed, Cornett's lawyer said a
trial could take place before the end of the year.
   Dock Cornett retained the right to live in a home at an edge of
the woods and to move about the property without restriction. He
keeps binoculars handy to observe the activities of the university
caretaker, Mike Brotzge.
   ``Getting the truth out is all I want,'' said Cornett, a retired
teacher, who was convicted on a misdemeanor charge of terroristic
threatening stemming from an altercation with Brotzge in 1987.
   Martin said suggestions that EKU was damaging the forest were
``absurd.'' He said the dam the university built along a stream
holds back a small amount of water for hydrology studies, and
experiments at the research buildings focus on acid rain and plant
species.
   Cornett and his lawyer, Coy Holstein of Whitesburg, said that in
addition to the serious accusations they have leveled against the
state and the university, they also are concerned that EKU officials
place too little emphasis on providing tours for visitors.
   Martin, who declined to discuss specific allegations in the
lawsuit, said only about 1,000 people visited the remote site in
1988. He said he thought no more than 3,000 visitors should be
allowed into the area annually and views the area primarily as a
research station.
   Visitors must make appointments to tour the woods. When visitors
arrived unannounced recently, Brotzge was working on a truck and
said he was too busy to provide a tour.
   If Cornett won the lawsuit, he would offer the land to other
state agencies or private conservation groups, Holstein said. If EKU
is allowed to keep the site, the lawyer said he believes the outlook
for the forest would be grim.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy said Tuesday it had
warned Americans to get out of Afghanistan. Most of them, along with
other Western private citizens, announced plans to leave.
   Some diplomatic sources predicted President Najib will declare
martial law as the last Soviet military forces withdraw and leave
his army to fight alone against a Moslem insurgency that began after
a communist coup 11 years ago.
   Other than those in embassies, most Westerners are with the
International Aid Mission, a charitable organization that has
operated in Afghanistan for many years. Among other things, it runs
an eye hospital in Kabul.
   ``They've finally gotten through to us,'' said Richard Penner, a
Canadian who directs the mission.
   Penner said 10 people would stay, including himself, but the
other 42 would be gone by Feb. 11, four days before the Soviet
withdrawal deadline. The mission had 85 people in Afghanistan last
summer.
   The dozen Americans in Afghanistan, other than 11 at the embassy,
work for the mission.
   Nearly all dependents of foreigners already have left.
   Predictions of martial law accompanied growing evidence, despite
repeated Soviet denials, that the Red Army is pulling out of Kabul
ahead of the deadline set in a U.N.-mediated withdrawal agreement.
   A 70-vehicle military convoy left Kabul on Monday, heading north
on the Salang Highway that connects the capital with the Soviet
border 250 miles away. It included six tanks, armored personnel
carriers and trucks loaded with soldiers.
   It was the first northern movement of Soviet troops observed this
week. Western diplomats said convoys of up to 100 vehicles each were
seen moving up the highway four days last week.
   Afghan soldiers have replaced Soviet personnel at some guard
posts on Kabul's perimeter and hundreds of Red Army soldiers with
full gear have been seen boarding Ilyushin-76 transport planes at
the airport.
   Members of the Interior Ministry militia, a force of 30,000
considered to be among the government's best, were placed at
checkpoints in downtown Kabul a few days ago.
   Western diplomats in Islamabad, Pakistan, said Tuesday the heavy
convoy and air traffic indicated the final Soviet withdrawal was in
progress. The sources also reported intense fighting between
government forces in Kanduz, a northern province, and in Nangarhar
and Kandahar provinces to the east.
   They said the pace of departure indicated nearly all Soviet
forces would be out by the end of January. One diplomat, speaking
privately like the others, quoted Afghans and East European
diplomats as saying a paratroop battalion or other small force might
remain until the Feb. 15 deadline.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and an
estimated 115,000 were in the country wen the witdrawal agreement
was signed April 14 in Geneva. The pullout began May 15 and half
were gone by Aug. 15.
   Jon D. Glassman, charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy, said in a
warning letter to Americans that ``a critical point'' had come in
the Kabul area, increased instablity was likely, and they should
leave while commercial flights remained available.
   Only the Soviet airline Aeroflot and Ariana, the Afghan
government airline, still operate from Kabul. Aeroflot uses military
planes and Ariana flights are unpredictable, sometimes delayed or
canceled for lack of aviation fuel.
   Britain's embassy issued a similar warning last week to to its
nationals and citizens of other countries for which it has
diplomatic responsibility, including Canada, Australia and Ireland.
   Other than the missionaries, foreigners still in Afghanistan
include a few hundred diplomats, a dwindling number of Soviet
civilian advisers, employees of the International Red Cross and
officials of U.N. aid agencies and the U.N. body monitoring the
withdrawal agreement.
   On Saturday, the West German Embassy became the first to close.
Spokesmen for others say they confer regularly about when or whether
to do the same.
   Food shortages in Kabul have been severe because of guerrilla
attacks on supply convoys, and the Soviets began a flour airlift
last weekend that brings in 400-500 tons a day.
   Maj. Gen. Lev Serebrov, the Soviet deputy commander in
Afghanistan, insisted Sunday the final withdrawal had yet to begin.
   Western analysts believe the Kremlin wants to keep the pullout
under wraps for security and political reasons, including continued
political pressure on guerrilla leaders to resume negotitons for a
coalition government including communists.
   Leaders of the seven-party guerrilla alliance based in Pakistan
have refused such a deal and broke off talks with the Soviets about
a political solution.

<HEAD>Residents Of Conservative County Like Gorbachev More Than Bush</HEAD>

leaders; Picks up 6th graf, `The message ...'</HEAD>

   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev edged
President Bush in a survey of opinions toward world leaders in
Republican-dominated Orange County, but both ran behind British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Reagan, according to
a poll released today.
   The Los Angeles Times-sponsored survey of Orange County residents
also revealed that 45 percent think the Cold War between the
superpowers is coming to an end.
   The results came in the county that gave Bush and former
President Ronald Reagan their largest margins of victory of any U.S.
county in the presidential elections of 1980, 1984 and 1988.
   Asked, ``Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of these
world leaders,'' positive ratings were as follows: 79 percent for
Mrs. Thatcher, 76 percent for Reagan, 70 percent for Gorbachev, 67
percent for Bush and 21 percent for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
   The poll, which involved 600 adults in the county southeast of
Los Angeles, had a 4 percentage point margin of error, the newspaper
said.
   ``The message is that Orange County is more in the mainstream of
American thinking than the perception,'' said longtime Reagan
adviser Stu Spencer. ``Thinking on the Cold War undoubtedly is
changing due to Ronald Reagan's policies.''
   The poll, taken Jan. 13-17 by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of
Irvine, also found that more Orange County residents see Japan and
the Third World as a threat to the United States than the Soviet
Union and China.
   Thirty-one percent said the Third World presented the greatest
threat to the future of the United States. Just 17 percent said the
Soviet Union presents the greatest threat, while 6 percent felt
China was the greatest threat.
   On the issues of abortion, AIDS education and pornography, Orange
County residents again showed a softening of their perceived
conservative tendencies.
   Sixty percent opposed a Supreme Court ban on abortions and 56
percent opposed a ban on the rental of X-rated films at video stores.
   Regarding acquired immune deficiency syndrome, 82 percent favored
teaching youngsters in public schools about the use of condoms as a
means of controlling the spread of the deadly AIDS virus.

   Wildlife authorities Tuesday canceled a
plan to fly 10 rhinoceros to the United States.
   The rare black rhino were scheduled to be flown to the Fort
Worth, Texas, Zoo on Sunday, but mechanical problems delayed the
cargo plane, and Zimbabwe officials called off the operation, a
wildlife department spokesman said.
   The spokesman said the animals were in a weakened condition and
travel would be risky. No replacement aircraft was available Tuesday.
   The rhino were in crates for five days and were being released
under veterinary supervision, the spokesman added.
   The Zimbabwe news agency said the U.S. zoo will be asked to
renegotiate the acquisition of rhino for a captive breeding program
launched two years ago.
   The agency said Elvie Turner, the director of Forth Worth Zoo,
was in Harare to supervise the departure of the animals.
   ``We want to do what is best for the animals. If it has been felt
better not to keep them in crates anymore, it is fine,'' the agency
quoted Turner as saying.

<TEXT>
   The city's top safety official said fire
inspectors are backing away from a campaign to enforce a ban on
candles in restaurants.
   ``It would seem we've given this a higher priority than
necessary,'' Public Safety Director Glenn Cannon said Monday.
   Cannon said he and fire Chief Charles Dickinson had been unaware
that fire prevention inspectors were cracking down on the use of
open flames. The campaign met criticism and defiance from
restaurateurs.
   Inspectors began in December visiting restaurants and warning
operators they could be fined $1,000 unless they stopped using
candles, oil lamps or other open flames without prior fire
department approval.
   Fire Capt. Robert Friel said last week that the campaign began
after inspectors noticed increased use of candles and flaming lamps
in crowded restaurants.
   The ordinance also covers churches and synagogues, but Friel said
inspectors would not try to ban open flames in places of worship.
   Dickinson said the inspectors will continue to enforce the fire
code, they don't need to carry out plans to visit every restaurant
in the city.

<HEAD>Ban on Speech Fees Could Make Congressional Speakers Scarce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-seven members of Congress attended the
tobacco industry's annual conference near Palm Springs, Calif.,
earlier this month, staying at a posh resort with a golf course,
tennis courts and a spa _ and receiving nice speaking fees.
   One of those attending was Congress' speaking-fees champion,
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski. The
Illinois Democrat, who also played in Bob Hope's golf tournament in
Palm Springs, made three speeches for $2,000 each and two speeches
at $7,500 each while he was in the area, an aide said.
   Soon, however, if a proposed deal goes through, in return for a
big pay raise senators and representatives would give up access to
the hefty speaking fees that have helped attract many of them to
thousands of functions each year.
   It's not clear how trip expenses would be handled. However,
unless members of Congress are forced to pay all their travel and
lodging expenses, conferences in places such as Palm Springs would
seem to face no problem bringing in the people they want.
   But some cities and groups could have trouble.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., summing up the situation bluntly, said
that without a speaking fee, ``I would not fly to Cleveland to speak
to a trade group I didn't care about.''
   He said that if such fees _ known as honoraria _ are banned, he
would accept only engagements ``to get out a particular message or
rally the troops'' on issues he cared about.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I. said he ``wouldn't speak as much''
without honoraria, but would continue to address groups where he
could ``drum up support'' for his legislative goals.
   Rep. Doug Barnard Jr., D-Ga., said some of his colleagues ``say
if it's not a $2,000 honorarium, it's not worth going to.'' He
hastened to add, ``I'm not like that.''
   Senators currently can keep honoraria amounting to 40 percent of
salary _ in other words up to $35,800 for rank-and-file members,
more for leaders who receive extra pay. A House limit of 30 percent
of salary amounts to $26,850 for the rank-and-file. Honoraria
include payment for speeches, appearances and written articles.
   Lawmakers in both houses can retain up to $2,000 per article or
event, with any fee exceeding that figure _ or any amount over the
annual cap _ going to charity.
   Congressional leaders have said lawmakers would ban such fees in
return for a 50 percent pay raise that would send rank-and-file
salaries zooming from $89,500 to $135,000.
   Unless both houses vote to stop it, the pay increase recommended
by former President Reagan in his budget plan would become law in
two weeks.
   Spokesmen for some interest groups say they're are wondering if
they'll still attract lawmakers for convention speeches, plant tours
and Washington power lunches with lobbyists if they can no longer
offer fees.
   In the case of the Palm Springs gathering, Sen. Thomas A.
Daschle's office said the South Dakota Democrat earned a $2,000
honorarium at the tobacco conference. The Tobacco Institute paid
$1,392 in airfare for the senator and his wife and gave them three
nights lodging.
   Tobacco Institute spokesman Walker Merryman would not confirm the
honoraria and expense costs of bringing 27 lawmakers to a resort
near Palm Springs, but said all of the congressional guests received
the same financial considerations.
   Rostenkowski combined his Palm Springs trip with participation in
the Hope golf tournament, where proceeds are given to charity. The
lawmaker reported receiving $245,000 in honoraria in 1987, more than
any other member of Congress. He gave $219,156 to charity.
   Other examples of honoraria since the past Congress adjourned:
   _Daschle, whose office said he earned $9,000 in fees since the
100th Congress quit last Oct. 22, dashed to Princeton, N.J., and
back in a Squibb Corp. plane Jan. 17, to make a $2,000 breakfast
speech at company headquarters.
   _Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., picked up $8,000 from three
appearances, including addresses at two universities.
   _Senate Republican Whip Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, known for his
wit as a speaker, earned $11,500 in fees since adjournment,
including $4,000 for participating Nov. 16-20 in a government
conference in Indian Wells near Palm Springs.
   _Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Senate Energy
Committee, was flown to Puerto Rico and back in an American Cyanamid
jet Dec. 15-16, for speeches, a plant tour and other activities. The
senator received a $1,000 honorarium and took his wife along,
although the company said it did not pay any extra expenses for Mrs.
Johnston.
   _Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., an Eagle Scout, earned $2,000 from
speaking to the Boy Scouts of America; Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho,
spoke to the Western Growers Association for $2,000; Sen. Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah, addressed a health care organization for $1,500, and
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., gave an address for $2,000 to
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
   ``If they want to change the rules of the game that's fine,''
said Mark Gorman, senior director for government affairs of the
National Restaurant Association. ``But I would be concerned if the
result was that we would continue to issue invitations, and get no
response. I suspect it would be more difficult.
   Michael Koleda, president of the Council for Alternative Fuels,
the synthetic fuels lobby, said, ``Unburdened by the need to earn
additional income, members will be free to be with those groups they
like to be with.''
   ``So I suspect,'' he added with a chuckle, ``that we would do
very well.''

   Government officials from the United States and
Laos will meet this week in Vientiane to schedule surveys and
excavations in the hunt for American servicemen missing from the
Vietnam war, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The meeting will begin Thursday and extend through Saturday. The
U.S. delegation will be led by Harriet Isom, the charge d'affaires
at the American embassy in Vientiane.
   Earlier this month, U.S. and Laotian officials ``agreed to
establish a year-round POW-MIA work plan,'' the Pentagon said in a
statement.
   ``Excavations, surveys or investigations to be conducted later
this year may be planned at this (upcoming) meeting,'' it added.
   The American delegation will include technical experts from the
Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the U.S. Army Central
Identification Laboratory.
   There are 2,383 Americans still listed as missing from the
Vietnam war, including 547 who were lost in Laos.

<HEAD>Man Reportedly Got AIDS Virus from Woman During Oral Sex</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: A Wednesday embargo on this story was broken. Note contents.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man reportedly contracted the AIDS virus by
having oral sex with a woman, the first report in medical literature
of woman-to-man transmission of the virus in that fashion, according
to a doctor.
   The case of the 60-year-old New England man was reported in this
week's New England Journal of Medicine by two physicians from the
Lahey Clinic Medical Center.
   ``I hope the message gets through, especially to younger people
in high school and college, who cling to the belief that they're all
right if they don't have intercourse,'' said Dr. Peter G. Spitzer,
one of the authors.
   The man who got the virus reportedly has been married for 30
years and has diabetes, which caused nerve damage that made him
impotent. He told his doctors he had not had sex with his wife for
years.
   The doctors said the man's only sexual contact in recent years
was with a prostitute with whom he engaged only in oral sex.
   He said the woman used intravenous drugs in his presence. This
suggested the possibility that she contracted the virus from sharing
hypodermic needles rather than from sexual activity, the report said.
   The two doctors from the Lahey Clinic in Burlington did not seek
out the prostitute because of state laws on the confidentiality of
AIDS patients, Spitzer said.
   ``Ironically, if she had syphilis, state health authorities could
trace her,'' he said.
   Spitzer said it is most likely that the virus was transmitted to
the man through her vaginal secretions. Researchers at Massachusetts
General Hospital have found the AIDS virus in vaginal fluids.
   But studies have shown that saliva can contain small amounts of
the virus, and it could have been transmitted through the
prostitute's saliva.
   Spitzer and his co-author, Dr. Neil J. Weiner, wrote that
``public health education about safer sexual practices must not only
advocate the use of barrier contraceptives such as condoms during
vaginal and rectal intercourse, but also caution against the
exchange of bodily fluids during other sexual practices, such as
oral sex.''

   A group of armed civilians
surrendered this morning after holding off hundreds of tank- and
artillery-backed soldiers and police at an army base for a day, the
government news agency said.
   Shots rang out in the distance while President Raul Alfonsin
toured the base later, but authorities said the shots were not aimed
at the president or his helicopter.
   At least 25 people were killed in fighting after about 40
commandos, who the government said were leftist guerrillas, broke
through the base's main gate in a stolen truck Monday, authorities
said.
   The state-run Telam news agency said 13 men and one woman left
the base early this morning, their hands in the air and one waving a
white shirt as a flag of surrender.
   It was unclear whether all 14 were involved in the takeover. The
two private news agencies, Diarios y Noticias and Noticias
Argentinas, said some may have been hostages.
   As the president toured the base, soldiers and police exchanged
sporadic gunfire with three men outside the compound _ one in a
tower, one in a building, and the third in a car. They later chased
the gunmen, but it was not immediately known if they caught them.
   Local news reports said some commandos had also sniped at police
and troops Monday from positions outside the La Tablada base, on the
capital's western outskirts.
   The red brick officers' club in which the attackers holed up was
virtually leveled by tank and mortar fire, and the woman who walked
out this morning was was wounded and had to be carried by two
comrades, Telam reported.
   Soldiers took the 14 into custody and entered the bombed-out
officers club, it said.
   The battle was the most serious of its kind since an attack by
the leftist People's Revolutionary Party and an allied guerrilla
group on an army arsenal in 1975.
   Five soldiers were killed and more than 30 soldiers and police
officers wounded in Monday's battle, Telam reported. Carlos Becerra,
an aide to Alfonsin, said at least 20 commandos were killed.
   The commandos either carried with them or stole ground-to-ground
missiles and anti-tank guns, military officials said in explaining
they had held off government forces.
   They did not identify themselves or state their motives, but a
woman who called Diarios y Noticias on Monday said she belonged to
the group and claimed it had acted to prevent a military coup.
   ``It was to defend democracy and now they're massacring us,'' the
agency quoted the woman, who would not identify herself, as saying.
``Please, do something.''
   The popularly elected Alfonsin government has coped with three
military insurrections since April 1987, during which `loyalist'
troops were extremely reluctant to fire on their rebellious
colleagues.
   The incidents ended with little or no bloodshed. Public sentiment
has strongly backed Alfonsin against rebels in the armed forces,
which ruled the country for nearly eight years until he took office
in 1983.
   During the military dictatorship, at least 8,900 Argentine
leftists were arrested by security forces and never seen again. They
are presumed executed.
   The commandos had scattered right-wing pamphlets as they attacked
the base, but the government dismissed the notion they were anything
but leftist extremists.
   Cesar Jaroslavsky, president of the governing Radical Civic
Union's bloc in the House of Deputies, said some commandos were
members of the Peoples Revolutionary Army, which last battled
soldiers a decade ago.
   Inside the base on Monday, the commandos were confined to the red
brick officers club and several other buildings as soldiers blasted
their positions with tank and mortar fire, setting the buildings
ablaze.
   Some had fled the base and hid out in nearby buildings, sniping
at police and soldiers, local news agencies reported.
   At 9:30 p.m., the armory exploded, sending bright flames 100
yards high into the darkness. Sporadic gunfire and an occasional
mortar rounds continued inside the compound early today.
   The pamphlets thrown out by the commandos they entered the base
said ``Long Live Rico!'' and ``Long Live Seineldin!'', referring to
the leaders of the three military insurrections.
   Cashiered Lt. Col. Aldo Rico and Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, both
in military prison, mounted their revolts to press for an end to the
prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the
1976-83 military dictatorship.

   A judge today ordered the victim of an
alleged abduction and gang rape to testify after she asked him to
dismiss an aggravated kidnapping charge against the second of 10 men
charged in the case.
   The 20-year-old woman said she did not want to testify in the
trial of Felipe Chew, 29, because the media attention had disrupted
her life.
   The woman had provided emotional testimony in a September trial
that resulted in the conviction of Orlando Garza, 24, on a sexual
assault charge. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
   District Judge Gilberto Hinojosa, however, denied her request and
threatened to jail her for contempt of court if she refused to
testify.
   ``To a certain extent, I sympathize with what you've been going
through, or what you say you've been going through ... but too much
has happened for me to allow you to determine whether or not this
case should proceed,'' he said.
   The judge said he could not allow the case to be dropped if the
woman was not recanting her previous testimony before a grand jury
that indicted Chew. She said she did not recant the accusations.
   Defense attorneys filed motions to dismiss the case after the
woman said she did not want to testify, but the judge denied the
defense motion and called the jury into the courtroom.
   In opening arguments today, defense attorney Jaime Garza said the
trial would include evidence of ``women who have an insatiable
desire for sex. Women that just can't get enough, even with multiple
men.''
   On the stand, the woman identified Chew as one of the 20 or more
men who kidnapped her and repeatedly raped her on March 26.
   Chew has been in the Duval County Jail since March 31 in lieu of
bonds totaling $70,000.
   He was indicted along with nine other men last April after the
mother of two reported she was attacked. Chew also faces a sexual
assault charge in a later trial.

   An evangelist whom Jessica Hahn said she
turned to for solace following her sexual encounter with ousted PTL
leader Jim Bakker pleaded guilty today to two of 18 counts against
him.
   The guilty pleas by Long Island minister Eugene Profeta came as
his trial on state tax evasion, perjury and witness tampering
charges was about to start in state Supreme Court.
   Profeta pleaded guilty to offering a false instrument for filing,
his 1986 tax return, and to tampering with a witness, Hahn. Under
the plea-bargain agreement, he will be sentenced to six months in
jail and five years probation. He'll also be fined $5,000 and
ordered to pay $13,000 in state taxes.
   As part of the deal, Profeta also was ordered not to have any
contact with Hahn, his former church secretary.
   The surprise pleas ended a suppression hearing being held to
determine if transcripts of taped telephone conversations between
Profeta and Hahn, made with her consent, could be used at the trial.
   Revelations about Hahn's 1980 sexual encounter with Bakker led to
his ouster by the religious group.
   On Monday, a New York state investigator testified that Hahn told
him she had a cocaine habit and had received $12,000 in ``hush
money'' from the PTL ministry in what ``sounded like extortion.''
   Hahn said she used $7,000 to buy cocaine sometime after getting
two payments from the PTL ministry, said Richard Friedman, an
investigator for the state attorney general's office.
   Friedman testified in a suppression hearing on evidence for
Profeta's trial.
   Friedman testified that Hahn told him that one of her close
friends wrote a letter to the PTL ministry asking for $100,000 not
to talk about an alleged rape by Bakker.
   Hahn told him that she had a cocaine habit in 1984 and 1985 and
also had a dependence on the drug Fiorinal, Friedman testified.

   Vice President Dan Quayle will visit Venezuela
for the inauguration of its new president next month, with a stop in
El Salvador on the way back, the White House said today.
   Quayle's trip, the first foreign journey for a senior official of
the new Bush administration, will be Feb. 1-3, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   He will represent the United States at the swearing-in of Carlos
Andres Perez in Venezuela on Feb. 2.
   Fitzwater said the El Salvador stop was added so that Quayle
could discuss the elections there in March, and ``extend the best
wishes of President Bush who has known President (Jose Napoleon)
Duarte for a number of years and meet with other officials as
appropriate.''
   He referred questions on the identity of those officials to the
vice president's office, but spokeswoman Liz Murphy said she had no
information on it.
   Fitzwater said Quayle would express the concern for `the
democratic process there and seeing it continue as it has under
President Duarte. We have concern abouut the guerrilla activity in
El Salvador and any threats that that may have in the election
process and I'm sure the vice president will discuss that with him.`

   John Gotti, reputed boss of the nation's most
powerful organized-crime family, was arrested on charges that he
ordered the shooting of a union leader, according to an indictment
unsealed today.
   One newspaper today said Gotti ordered his associates to ``put a
rocket in his pocket.''
   Criminal court Judge Patricia Williams ordered Gotti held without
bail at his arraignment Monday, but he was released today on
$100,000 bond.
   The grand jury indictment involves the May 7, 1986, shooting of
John F. O'Connor, vice president and business manager of Carpenters
Union Local 608.
   According to the indictment, ``It was the specific goal and
intention of the conspiracy to punish John F. O'Connor, and thereby
reaffirm the authority of the Gambino crime family over all others
who might challenge it.''
   O'Connor, now 49, was shot several times in the buttocks in what
investigators said was retaliation for having ordered vandalism at a
Manhattan restaurant in February 1986 because the establishment was
using non-union carpenters.
   He apparently was unaware the owners of the Bankers and Brokers
restaurant were Gotti's friends, the New York Times reported today.
   Also arrested in connection with the shooting were two Gotti
associates: Angelo Ruggiero and Anthony Guerrieri, authorities said.
Law enforcement officials described Ruggiero, 48, as a captain in
the Gambino crime family, and Guerrieri, 60, as a ``soldier.''
   Gotti, the organization's 48-year-old reputed leader, was
arrested Monday evening while walking with his bodyguard on a street
in Little Italy. He was charged with first-degree assault and
conspiracy, District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said.
   Law enforcement officials said Gotti offered no resistance.
   ``John Gotti is in jail, ironically, for a crime designed to
consolidate his power,'' said Ronald Goldstock, director of the
state Organized Crime Task Force, appearing at a news conference
today with Morgenthau.
   Aides to Morgenthau said that shortly before O'Connor was
wounded, law enforcement officials overheard Gotti, on a
court-approved listening device, talk about a planned execution of a
union leader, who was not identified.
   The Daily News quoted sources as saying that Gotti told an
associate O'Connor had become ``overconfident'' and he wondered if
he should ``bust him up.'' The New York Post said Gotti could be
heard ordering his henchmen to ``put a rocket in his pocket.''
   O'Connor was not seriously hurt in the shooting.
   The contract for killing O'Connor allegedly was given to a member
of the Westies, a gang that operated on Manhattan's West Side,
authorities said.
   At the arraignment Monday, Gotti's attorney, Bruce Cutler,
objected when a prosecutor asked that Gotti be denied bail. Cutler
said Gotti has not been convicted of a crime in 15 years and has
made all prior required court appearances, including his federal
racketeering trial, which ended in acquittal in March 1987.
   But Williams said she did not have the paperwork to document
Cutler's assertions and denied bail.

<HEAD>Hezbollah's Guru Writes Americans Pressing for Hostages' Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The spiritual leader of a radical Moslem group
believed to hold nine Americans hostage in Lebanon has written to
those pressing for the captives' release that he wants to see an end
to the ``human suffering,'' recipients said Tuesday.
   A State Department official who has seen the correspondence from
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah said, ``The letters themselves are
unusual, but the content is not.'' The official refused to be quoted
by name.
   Fadlallah, 53, is the spiritual guru of Hezbollah, an umbrella
group of pro-Iranian Moslem Shiites. Elements within the Lebanese
group actively employ terrorism and are thought to control the
American hostages, U.S. officials say.
   Fadlallah's written statements, in Arabic, came in response to
letters sent to him by Peggy Say, the sister of hostage Terry
Anderson; the Journalists Committee to Free Terry Anderson; the New
York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, and Ray Barnett, the
head of Friends in the West and Ambassadors of Aid, two humanitarian
groups in Seattle, Wash.
   Anderson, an Associated Press correspondent in Beirut when he was
kidnapped in March 1985, has been held longer than any of the other
American hostages.
   On Tuesday, the wives of three American professors at Beirut
University College, seized two years ago, appealed for the release
of their husbands as they began their third year in captivity. The
three men are Alann Steen of Boston, Robert Polhill of New York and
Jesse Turner of Boise, Idaho.
   The responses Fadlallah gave to the letter-writers were similar
in tone and content, but were not identical.
   ``We are always sorry for the continuous human suffering which we
have tried to solve and continue to try to solve to bring the
situation to a happy ending,'' Fadlallah wrote Mrs. Say, who lives
in Cadiz, Ky.
   To Anne Nelson, executive director of the Committee to Protect
Journalists, Fadlallah said, ``I have tried several times to
intervene to find a solution of their situation but my efforts
failed because they were complicated by factors at the international
level.''
   The Moslem leader told William Foley, a Time magazine
photographer in New York who works with the committee to free
Anderson, that ``we emphasize our concern to maintain friendly
relations with the American people. ...''
   Fadlallah disavowed any responsibility for the kidnappings.
   Mrs. Say, who has written Fadlallah in the past but never before
received a response, said she interpreted the letter as meaning the
Shiite leader might be willing to be a ``point of contact'' in any
negotiations to free the hostages. She pointed out that Fadlallah
knows Anderson, who had interviewed him as a reporter.
   The letters, delivered through an intermediary, were received
last week.
   The U.S. official said that Fadlallah has made many
pronouncements about the hostages, some of which have appeared to be
contradictory. Moreover, he said that officials are ``not quite sure
how much influence (Fadlallah) has personally'' over the kidnappers.
   The United States has a policy of not negotiating with those
holding hostages, although officials will talk about the welfare of
the captives.
   ``There is no direct contact between us and the Iranians and
between us and Fadlallah,'' the official said.
   In a newspaper interview published in October, Fadlallah was
quoted as saying the fate of the hostages ``would have to wait for
the outcome of the American presidential election.'' He said then
that Iran preferred to deal with Republicans.
   President Bush has said he foresees the day of better relations
with Iran, which could lead to the release of the hostages. ``I
don't start off with the view that we always have to be at
loggerheads,'' he said recently.
   Still, Bush has said he thinks it would be wrong to assume that
Iran ``controls a key to all these hostages.''
   Iran's prime minister, Hussein Musavi, said last week the hostage
issue was an ``internal question of Lebanon,'' and what his country
can do is limited because ``it is a question of territory.''
   The other hostages are Thomas Sutherland, a dean at the American
University of Beirut; Joseph James Cicippio, acting comptroller of
the university; Frank Herbert Reed, director of the Lebanon
International School in Beirut; Edward Austin Tracy, an author, and
Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, head of an observer group
attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon.

<HEAD>Gary Busey, Still Confined to Private Rehab Facility, Doing Well</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Gary Busey remained in a private
rehabilitation facility but was progressing well 52 days after being
thrown off his motorcycle and slamming head-first into a curb, his
publicist said.
   ``It's going to take a while for him, but they expect a full
recovery,'' spokeswoman Carla Schalman said Tuesday. ``He's doing
well, but it's a slow process and he won't be well overnight. They
are happy with his progress.''
   Busey, 44, underwent 90 minutes of brain surgery at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center following the Dec. 4 accident in Culver City. He
entered the rehabilitation facility over the New Year's weekend.
   Ms. Schalman said the location of the facility was kept
confidential to guard the actor's privacy and dismissed speculation
that Busey's injuries may have been more serious than originally
thought.
   ``He's making progress in the rehabilitation, which involves
exercising and weight lifting,'' she said.
   Busey, an active opponent of mandatory helmet laws, wasn't
wearing a helmet when he lost control of his motorcycle.
   The actor was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance
in the title role of ``The Buddy Holly Story.'' His other credits
include ``Big Wednesday,'' ``Lethal Weapon'' and the HBO miniseries
``A Dangerous Life.''

<HEAD>Focus on Military Strategy Seen as Senators Await Tower Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional leaders, awaiting testimony this
week by President Bush's nominee for secretary of defense, say the
legislative agenda involving defense policy is likely to center on
military strategy after eight years of the largest peacetime
build-up.
   Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearings start
Wednesday on former Sen. John G. Tower, R-Texas, Bush's choice to
head the Defense Department.
   The 63-year-old Tower, whose 24 years as a senator included a
stint a chairman of the committee, is expected to win approval from
his former colleagues despite concerns about his personal life and
work as a defense consultant.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, has said that Tower
is likely to win Senate confirmation.
   Among issues the committee is expected to raise with Tower are
the Pentagon budget, defense policy and Bush's appointments to
civilian posts within the department.
   Meantime, matching resources such as strategic weapons and
conventional forces to the type of military commitment the Bush
administration envisions will be the subject for a series of
congressional hearings during this legislative session.
   After two terms under Ronald Reagan in which the administration
allocated $2.13 trillion to the Defense Department, a figure that
does not include Department of Energy spending on nuclear warheads,
Congress is expected to take a careful look at strategy and the cost
of resources in light of the budget deficit situation.
   In his final budget, Reagan requested $315.2 billion in budget
authority _ a 2 percent increase after inflation _ for defense in
fiscal 1990, the 12 months opening Oct. 1.
   ``I think they're whistling Dixie if they think they'll get a 2
to 3 percent increase in spending,'' said Rep. Sonny Montgomery,
D-Miss., a member of the House Armed Services Committee. ``They'll
be fortunate if they get the inflation factor.''
   Bush, according to testimony last week from Office of Management
and Budget nominee Richard Darman, is expected to reduce Reagan's
request by an unspecified amount. Congress will likely wait for
Bush's changes before acting on the budget.
   During last year's presidential campaign, Nunn and Sen. John
Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services
Committee, sent a letter to Bush and Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
nominee, stressing the importance of qualified people.
   ``Strong defense leadership will be needed during the next four
years to resolve serious strategy, budget, force structure,
manpower, alliance and arms control problems and issues,'' Nunn and
Warner said in the letter dated Oct. 28, 1988.
   ``Central to meeting those challenges is the appointment of the
highest quality and experienced defense management team,'' they
wrote.
   Also during this congressional session, hearings will be held on
the plan to close 86 military bases and partly close five more _ a
recommendation by a special federal commission that has since been
accepted by Reagan's Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci.
   Despite some opposition, the chances of Congress passing a
resolution of disapproval against the plan or overriding a
presidential veto remain slim, say congressional aides, who believe
the battle over the bases will be fought in appropriating the funds
to close the facilities.
   Debate will also resume over spending for Star Wars research and
development, moving the new B-2 stealth bomber into production and
funding for the truck-mobile, single-warhead Midgetman missile and
the rail-mobile version of the MX intercontinental ballistic missile.

<TEXT>
   Immigration authorities on Tuesday detained four
members of the New York-based Guardian Angels, including founder
Curtis Sliwa, for seven hours on their arrival at London's Gatwick
Airport.
   The organization plans to train more than 20 volunteers to
counter crime on the Underground, London's subway system, in the way
it does on the New York City subway.
   The Home Office said the four men would be allowed to stay in
Britain for six months provided they kept within the law.
   Sliwa said he did not object to being interrogated.
   ``I'm not bitter,'' he told reporters. ``I would hope they would
put many other people through (the screening procedure) _ drug
dealers, criminal types.''
   ``There is plenty of interest locally'' in the Angels, he said.
``We're here to complete a mission.''
   A Home Office spokesman, requesting anonymity, said the
authorities wanted to establish that the men met ``the requirements
of the immigration rules, and we are now so satisfied.''
   Foreign visitors need to satisfy immigration officers that they
do not intend to overstay their visit, can maintain themselves
financially without taking a job, and can afford a journey home.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, who is responsible for police and
immigration affairs, and London's police chief, Sir Peter Imbert,
made it clear they regarded the Angels as unnecessary.
   ``We have police and special constables (unpaid volunteers) and
we have neighborhood watch schemes which are admirable,'' he said,
referring to loosely organized groups of residents who report
anything suspicious.
   ``We have all kinds of ways in which the active citizen can help
the police to prevent crime and detect crime. Let us build on those
rather than go in for adventurous departures,'' Hurd said.
   Imbert said the Angels had nothing to teach Britain about
fighting crime.
   ``I must say that the first question I did ask myself, and
perhaps it's an unfair question, is that when one sees the state of
crime where they are coming from and then the state of crime here, I
ask what it is they can teach us here,'' Imbert said.
   During a visit to Britain in September, Sliwa was stabbed in the
face in a dispute in a London club with four men who said they did
not want vigilantes interfering with their criminal activities.
   Dave Edmonds, the Angels' London coordinator, said he hoped to
begin patrols on crime-plagued sections of the subway in March.
   Last month, muggers killed a Turkish student who resisted them on
the London subway and a British man had to have a kidney removed
after being knifed in the back on a subway train. Several women
recently have been raped on subway trains and in outlying stations.
   In the first eight months of 1988, there were 914 reported
robberies on the subway, up by 83 percent on the same period of
1987, and assaults on passengers rose 28 percent to 512.
   The 248-station subway network carries almost 700 million
passengers a year.

   Two men and a teen-ager were rescued from a
burning ferry Tuesday and then arrested for allegedly stealing it
for a joy ride, authorities said.
   The Catalina Island ferry caught fire after the engine overheated
in Los Angeles Harbor, firefighters said. Damage was estimated at
$500,000, said Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells.
   ``They didn't know how to run the boat, they almost got hit by a
tanker when they were running without lights, and when the Coast
Guard took them off the burning boat they appeared panic-stricken,''
said Officer Donald Dille of the police Harbor Division.
   The 56-foot ferry was taken from a berth during the night on an
apparent joy ride, Dille said. It was spotted on fire about 3 a.m.
   ``They apparently failed to open the sea chest, which allows
water to circulate around the engine to keep it cool,'' said Long
Beach Coast Guard spokesman Brad Smith. He said authorities
extinguished the fire in about 20 minutes.
   The boat normally is used for daily trips between the harbor and
Catalina Island, a tourist destination 21 miles offshore.
   Roy Bennett and Danny Andrews, both 28, of Bell Gardens were held
for investigation of grand theft of a vessel, a felony. Their
15-year-old companion was turned over to juvenile authorities and
later released to his parents.

<HEAD>Van Brings Methadone to Addicts in Boston Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first of 250 heroin addicts expected to
participate in Boston's mobile drug treatment program stepped aboard
a 32-foot van Tuesday to receive their first doses of methadone.
   Three city employees boarded the unmarked recreational vehicle at
dawn and set out for a state hospital in the city's Jamaica Plain
section, the first of two stops.
   ``What the van will do is allow necessary treatment to be
delivered so addicts will have a greater access to the programs,''
said Sarah Gant, a city health policy analyst. She said the new
service would make it easier for heroin addicts to get treatment on
their way to work or school.
   Candidates are screened and tested before being admitted to the
state-funded treatment, one of only two such programs nationwide,
said Tom Scott, the Addiction Services' acting administrative
director.
   The nation's first mobile methadone program got under way in
Brockton last month after gaining federal approval. It also has been
serving Taunton and Plymouth.
   Methadone, a synthetic opiate that satisfies the body's craving
but does not produce a heroin high, is dispensed to addicts in
medically controlled liquid doses.
   City health officials decided to use a van after Gov. Michael
Dukakis said he wouldn't approve a bill allowing them to distribute
sterile hypodermic needles to drug addicts as a way to stop the
spread of AIDS. Intravenous drug use, specifically the sharing of
dirty needles, is one way the deadly virus is transmitted.
   The city is leasing the van for $700 a month, paid for out of
$400,000 the state allocated to Boston to expand its methadone
programs.
   Medical monitoring and psychological and vocational counseling
are also part of the program, Scott said.
   Ms. Gant said all participants would be stabilized by officials
at Boston City Hospital before being admitted to the program, and
that those patronizing the van will be subjected to random urine
tests to ensure they are not using illegal drugs.
   About 250 people currently receive methadone from a city program
set up in a trailer outside Boston City Hospital. Eventually, the
van is expected to assist an additional 110 people, Scott said.

<HEAD>Urban League Encouraged Bush Will Aid Black America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economic gap between blacks and whites
widened during the Reagan years, the National Urban League said
Tuesday while finding encouraging signs that President Bush may take
steps to improve conditions for black America.
   ``I expect the Bush White House to be a very different place from
the Reagan White House,'' John E. Jacob, the president of the
National Urban League, said.
   ``I am hopeful that he will implement policies that close the
tragic gap that puts African Americans on a separate and unequal
track from white Americans,'' he said.
   The Urban League, releasing its annual assessment of the status
and conditions of blacks in America, cited statistics that, it said,
show that racial inequality is growing and that blacks face
increasing misery from poverty, crime and drugs.
   Jacob said blacks were the only major ethnic group whose
unemployment rate rose during the 1980s. He said housing segregation
increased, and black life expectancy at birth began to decline.
   ``Blacks did not share the prosperity and got more than their
share of the misery'' during the 1980s, Jacob said at a news
conference at which he released the study.
   The report, ``The State of Black America, 1989,'' is the 14th
annual assessment of black America by the league, a 78-year-old
organization that conducts research and is an advocate for
minorities.
   In a summary of economic conditions, David H. Swinton, dean of
the business school at Jackson State University in Mississippi,
wrote that no progress was made during the Reagan administration to
reduce economic disparities faced by blacks.
   ``In fact, racial inequality in American life actually increased
by many of the standard indicators,'' he wrote
   Jacob said that some blacks benefited from the economic growth
during the Reagan administration, but he said that was confined to
those who were the most educated and best trained.
   He said Bush's Cabinet appointments ``have been wise, and there
are people at key departments with whom we can work.'' He called on
Bush to adopt as a goal achieving economic parity between whites and
blacks by the year 2000.
   The report contains a grim assessment of the outlook for black
children in America. Marian Wright Edelman wrote that compared with
1980, black children are more likely to be born into poverty, lack
early prenatal care, have a single mother, have an unemployed parent
and not go to college.
   A black baby is three times as likely as a white baby to be born
to a mother who has had no prenatal care and is more than twice as
likely to die during the first year, she said. A black male teenager
is six times as likely as a white male teenager to be the victim of
a homicide, she said.
   ``Millions of black children today live in a desolate world where
physical survival is a triumph, where fear and hopelessness reign,
and where the future holds no promises and few opportunities,'' said
Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund.
   In another section, the report said the number of blacks enrolled
in four-year colleges has declined since 1980, while other minority
groups have shown increases.
   The report said per capita income for blacks slipped when
compared to per capita income for whites. The percentage of blacks
with household incomes below the poverty level grew, and 45 percent
of black children younger than 18 live in poverty, it said.
   ``The new administration will face the harsh reality that racial
inequality persists and is not attenuating,'' Swinton wrote. ``...
New policies must be put in place by the new administration if
progress towards racial parity in economic life is to resume and to
be maintained.''
   The report said that black families have been
``disproportionately devastated'' by the declining stock of
affordable housing and that blacks are ``overrepresented (by) the
thousands of families and children living in welfare hotels and
shelters for the homeless.''

<HEAD>Brady Says Government Could Act on Corporate Buyouts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady suggested
on Tuesday that unless the investment community stems the tide of
debt-financed corporate takeovers the government will step in.
   ``It is the finest tradition of our democratic system that
government look first to the people themselves for solutions and
only act _ but do act _ when it is clear the people cannot solve the
problem themselves,'' he said.
   Brady told the Senate Finance Committee the new Bush
administration favors eliminating or reducing taxes on corporate
dividends as a way to reduce leveraged buyouts or LBOs.
   He acknowledged that the federal budget deficit likely precludes
that.
   However, his testimony was the clearest indication yet that the
new administration views the multibillion-dollar debt-financed
takeovers as a possible threat to the U.S. economy and is willing to
take action to stem them.
   ``I have a feeling that we are headed in the wrong direction when
so much of our young talent and the nation's financial resources are
aimed at financial engineering while the rest of the world is laying
the foundation for the future,'' he said.
   Brady said he would prefer that ``the gladiators in the arena,''
the investment bankers, corporate and insurance executives and
pension fund managers who issue and trade in high-interest,
high-risk junk bonds, come up with evidence that the resulting debt
burdens are not harmful, or else that they suggest proposals for
addressing them.
   While companies acquired through leveraged buyouts often lack the
cash flows to pay interest on the junk bonds that financed the
deals, the bankers, underwiters and fund managers in the
transactions make millions of dollars in fees, Brady complained.
   ``Sadly, these same parties may have relatively little, if any,
investment in the long-term success of the new enterprise,'' he
said. ``Given this arrangement, it may very well be that the net
effect of LBOs is a snipe hunt, where the new long-term investors,
flashight in hand, are left holding the bag.''
   Quite a different view was expressed earlier Tuesday by
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David Ruder, who is
scheduled to testify Wednesday before the Senate panel.
   Ruder said on ``CBS This Morning'' that the leveraged buyouts are
increasing ownership of companies by the managers who run them ``and
will make us a more productive economy.''
   ``After these buyouts, the managers of the divisions typically
will be allowed to run the divisions without having to be overseen
by top management of the large conglomerate, and they may be very
much more efficient in their management when they're on their own,''
Ruder said.
   President Bush, two weeks ago before he took office, ruled out
direct government action to curtail the tide of takeovers but left
open the possibility of changing the way the tax laws treat
dividends and the deductibility of interest payments on junk bonds.
   ``There are things you can do in the tax laws,'' he said. ``If
there are abuses of our tax laws ... the whole tax law will be
reviewed to see how they can be eliminated.''
   Brady said any package of tax law changes seeking to discourage
debt financing of takeovers _ or of defenses against them _ by
limiting the deductibility of interest on junk bonds should be
coupled with some tax relief on company dividends.
   Taxing the interest that companies pay on junk bonds alone, he
said, ``would simply increase the cost of capital for American
acquirers by effectively raising their interest rates on an
after-tax basis.''
   Since that would not affect the borrowing costs of foreign
corporations, he said, U.S. companies would be at a competitive
disadvantage. Moreover, he said, junk bond issuers would likely find
new mechanisms to avoid taxes on the interest they pay.
   ``The long history of attempts to define problems out of
existence has proved that the definees are more adept than the
definers,'' Brady said. ``Just as new regulations are written,
efforts are under way to render them irrelevant.''
   Fears about the vulnerability of highly leveraged companies were
heightened last September when Revco D.S. Inc., the Cleveland-based
drug store chain, entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings after
defaulting on $700 million in bonds following a $1.4 billion buyout.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the Finance Committee's chairman,
said the Revco buyout raises concerns about what would happen to
other companies in the event of an economic downturn.
   ``No one can predict what will happen or when,'' Bentsen said,
``but we know what did happen, even in good times, after one LBO
transaction.''
   ``I think there's an appetite here to do something,'' Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means
panel, told reporters last week.``You get their attention when you
tickle the tax code.''

   A man jailed since September for attacking
a former neighbor's 200-year-old home with a chain saw was ordered
to live with his parents in Florida as a condition of his release.
   Kevin Michael Magill, 28, pleaded guilty Monday to simple
assault, criminal mischief, defiant trespass and recklessly
endangering another person in the Sept. 6 incident, in which he
damaged a door and cut down a tree that fell on the roof of the
Haycock Township home, causing more than $100,000 damage.
   A state trooper testified that Magill told police the attack was
provoked by a sewage odor emanating from the house. He had been
jailed since his arrest the day after the attack.
   Bucks County President Judge Isaac S. Garb sentenced Magill to
time served in the Bucks County Prison after Magill's parents agreed
to take custody of their son and put him to work in a motel they own
in Key West, Fla. They also promised to seek counseling for their
son.
   ``That's what I need at this time,'' Magill told the judge. He
said a psychiatrist had diagnosed him as manic depressive.
   Robert O'Kon, owner of the home built in 1774, had told the judge
he would not feel safe as long as Magill has an opportunity to
return to the area.
   Magill, a self-employed drywall installer, lived in a mobile home
across the street from O'Kon.

   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said today ``it can be assumed'' that Health and Human Services
Secretary-designate Louis Sullivan would implement President Bush's
abortion policies if confirmed by the Senate.
   ``Dr. Sullivan has repeatedly said ... that his views are
consistent with the president's,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman was asked to comment on a published report which
said Sullivan had been privately saying he does not want to see a
reversal of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. Bush
wants it reversed.
   Sullivan ``opposes public funding for abortions, but he does not
want to overturn a woman's right to make a choice,'' an unidentified
senior Republican lawmaker told The New York Times.
   Sullivan nearly lost his Cabinet nomination last month when he
told an interviewer he personally favored a woman's right to an
abortion. He later issued a statement that echoed Bush's opposition
to abortion except in cases of rape, incest or if the pregnancy
endangers the mother's life.
   During his White House briefing today, Fitzwater said Sullivan
never had indicated to Bush any disagreement with Bush's position on
the abortion question.
   ``Dr. Sullivan is committed to the president's positions,'' the
spokesman said. ``It can be assumed that he will implement
administration policy and the president's views.''
   ``If Dr. Sullivan has other recommendations and views, we'll be
glad to listen to them,'' the spokesman said. ``But the president's
position on this matter is the one that will guide our decisions in
the administration.''
   In connection with demonstrations marking the 16th anniversary of
the Roe vs. Wade decision, police on Monday arrested 153 people.
That came in one of the ``Operation Rescue'' protests outside a
clinic in the city.
   The March for Life event attracted some 67,000 people. It
received a boost from Bush, who told the anti-abortionists by way of
a telephone loudspeaker in a park near the White House that the
decision ``was wrong and should be overturned.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle met with Nellie Gray, the leader of the
March for Life, and other anti-abortion leaders. ``I couldn't think
of a more appropriate group to be meeting with,'' he said.
   District of Columbia police made the arrests outside the
Hillcrest Women's Center in northwest Washington and charged them
with blocking access to the building or crossing police lines, said
police spokesman Sgt. Joe Gentile.
   Police said doors at the clinic were locked for about two and a
half hours because of the protest.
   In Glen Burnie, Md., the Gynecare Center closed after about 300
demonstrators gathered at the clinic entrance and refused to move,
but no arrests were made, said Sgt. Joe Bisesi of the Anne Arundel
County Police.
   ``We'll stay as long as we have to,'' said demonstrator Kathy
Kelly before the closing. ``We hope to keep this place safe for the
day, which means no killing of babies and no exploitation of women.''
   Both protests were organized by a group in suburban Gaithersburg,
Md. known as ``Rachel's Rescue,'' which is part of a national effort
by abortion foes to use tactics of the 1960s civil rights movement
to stop women from having abortions.

<HEAD>General Says Pentagon Improves Its Airlift Ability</HEAD>

   The Pentagon has improved its ability to fly
troops and gear to Europe in the event of war but still lacks
transport ships, the head of the new military transportation command
said Tuesday.
   ``We are much better off now in terms of management and equipment
than we were'' before a disastrous transport exercise in 1978, said
Air Force Gen. Duane H. Cassidy, head of the U.S. Transportation
Command at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois.
   If Warsaw Pact troop reductions lead to the withdrawal of some
U.S. forces from Europe, those transporation needs may multiply, he
said. Meeting that requirement is among the problems facing John G.
Tower, President Bush's nominee for secretary of defense.
   Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearings on Tower
begin Wednesday.
   Officials say the United States keeps about 320,000 troops in
Europe, and the plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization call
for a massive movement of forces in wartime. If NATO conventional
forces are unable to halt a Soviet-led advance across Europe, NATO
would resort to nuclear weapons, officials say.
   Cassidy told reporters Tuesday that since the 1978 exercise
called Nifty Nugget, the military has modernized its fleet of C-5
and C-141 cargo airplanes and is adding a new C-17 cargo plane.
   Additionally, the military and most U.S. civilian carriers and
charter commercial aircraft have agreed to transport troops to
maneuvers in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, he said.
   The Pentagon also has placed supplies in areas where they might
be needed in wartime.
   In 1987, under pressure from Congress, the Pentagon created the
command placing Air Force, Navy and Army transporation units under
Cassidy.
   In an exercise scheduled later this year, he said, the Pentagon
plans to demonstrate it can handle 46 million to 48 million ton
miles per day, the unit used to measure transporation capacity. By
1998, he expects capacity to rise to 66 million ton miles a day.
   To meet its goals, the command should be able to move between 75
million and 125 million ton miles per day, he said.
   ``If we had 125 million ton miles, I could make the (military
commanders in chief) around the world some guarantees that I can't
make them today,'' Cassidy told reporters.
   A weaknesses in U.S. military transport is the American merchant
marine, which has shrunk over the years.
   U.S. owned and operated cargo ships carry only 4 percent of
America's martime commerce, said Cassidy.
   ``Our industry is not playing on a level field,'' he said,
arguing that other governments are building, subsidizing and
operating merchant marines that are gaining an increasing share of
the world shipping trade.
   Cassidy called on Congress, the administration and private
industry to work to raise the volume of shipping carried on American
vessels to 9 percent. If that is done, he said, ``I'll have enough
ships to do the job.''

<HEAD>Thousands in Hometown Bid Goodbye to Dali</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD LORANT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FIGUERAS, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of Salvador Dali's hometown
turned out Tuesday to say goodbye to the surrealist painter who
brought so much attention to this small town.
   A procession of about 7,000 people, including many students and
elderly residents, filed past Dali's open casket in his Galatea
Tower residence, then signed the guest books.
   ``Figueras owes him everything. There's no doubt about that,''
said Carlos Arche, 40, one of the dozen or so townspeople who had
waited for police to open up the tower residence at 8 a.m.
   Dali was to lie in state until funeral services Wednesday in the
14th century Gothic Sant Pere Roman Catholic church where he was
baptized 84 years ago.
   He was to be buried beneath the geodesic dome of the adjacent
Theater-Museum Dali, a converted municipal theater where he held his
first exhibition of paintings in 1918, when he was 14 years old.
   The flamboyant painter died Monday in Figueras Hospital where he
had been admitted Jan. 18 with severe heart trouble aggravated by
pneumonia.
   ``Dali has come home to his roots,'' said Narciso Costabella, the
priest who will officiate at the funeral Mass.
   White lace cloths draped with ribbons of black crepe hung from
balconies around the center of the town of 33,000 people.
Authorities declared three days of mourning.
   Dali, his upturned moustache neatly trimmed, his wispy hair
spread out around his head, was laid out in a white tunic trimmed
with a gold crown on its front.
   Dark-windowed sedans with police motorcycle escorts ocasionally
discharged regional and central government officials at the door.
   King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez sent
telegrams of condolence along with other leading Spanish political
figures.
   A. Reynolds Morse, founder of the Dali Museum in St. Petersburg,
Fla., arrived late Tuesday.
   Some older visitors wiped tears from their eyes as the left the
mansion.
   Two 16-year-old boys among those outside admitted they knew the
once-outspoken Dali only as an old recluse.
   But they said they were familiar with his art from several visits
to the Theater-Museum, where Dali's tomb has been dug in the floor
of the inner courtyard. The collection of his and other artists'
works is the second-most-popular in Spain and draws 350,000 people a
year to Figueras, near the French border in northeastern Spain.
   The Spanish weekly Panorama estimated Dali's fortune at about
$87.7 million. It includes works in the Theater-Museum, others
belonging to the Gala-Dali Foundation that runs it, his private
collection and real estate.
   Under Spanish law, Dali's will cannot be read until 15 days after
his death.
   The will reportedly divides his estate among the governments of
Figueras, Catalonia and Spain. It has not been announced whether
Miguel Domenech, Robert Descharnes or Antoni Pixot, who watched over
the painter in the last years of his life, would be named executor
of his will.
   Mayor Mariano Lorca said he did not know whether Dali's only
living close relative _ his sister, Ana Maria _ figured in the will
or whether she would visit Galatea Tower from her home in nearby
Cadaques.
   The Barcelona daily La Vanguardia reported Tuesday that she had
refused to visit her dying brother, who had severed all contact with
his family years ago.
   A founder of the surrealist movement in the late 1920s, Dali was
the last of an outstanding generation of Spanish painters that
included Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro.
   He returned to his native region in 1948 after living in Madrid,
Paris and several U.S. cities.
   In later years, he was known as much for his outrageous
personality and theatrical interviews as for his paintings.
   Dali sank into seclusion and depression when his wife, manager
and longtime muse, Gala, died in 1982.
   He had a history of heart problems and had been confined to a
wheelchair and fed through gastro-nasal tubes since he was badly
burned in a 1984 fire.

<HEAD>US Invokes Treaty to Resolve Dispute over Letelier</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States is invoking a 1914 treaty in
an effort to resolve a dispute with Chile over the 1976 car-bomb
death of a former top aide to President Salvador Allende, the State
Department said Tuesday.
   U.S. officials have long maintained that three Chilean secret
police agents were responsible for the Washington incident, which
claimed the lives of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando
Letelier and an American associate, Ronni Moffitt.
   The Chilean government, however, has refused U.S. requests for
the extradition of the three, and the issue has been a point of
contention between the two governments for years.
   Letelier, an outspoken critic of the government of President
Augusto Pinochet, also served as Chile's ambassador to Washington
under Allende and as defense minister.
   He and Ms. Moffitt were killed when a bomb placed under the car
in which they were riding exploded in the Embassy Row section of
Washington on Sept. 21, 1976.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said U.S. officials
presented Chile with a diplomatic note on Jan. 12 invoking the World
War I era treaty, which is designed to help end disputes that cannot
be resolved by diplomatic methods.
   He said the United States is asking that an international
commission established under the treaty investigate and report on
the facts surrounding the incident, ``including the involvement of
Chilean government officials and to investigate and report upon
subsequent investigations by the government of Chile into the
matter.''
   ``We believe that this treaty process provides an excellent and
neutral means for pursuing justice in the case and resolving the
differences between the U.S. and Chile that relate to the case, ''
Redman said.
   ``The U.S. government will therefore render all possible
assistance to the commission in carrying out its responsibilities
and we expect and trust that the government of Chile will do the
same.''
   Asked whether he expected that Chile will go along with the U.S.
approach, Redman said Chile is obliged to do so under the treaty.
   The president of the five-member panel is Madame Suzanne Bastid
of France. Two other members, picked by the United States, are
William Mulligan of New York and Sir John Freeland of Great Britain.
The other members, selected by Chile, are Edmundo Vargas of Chile
and Judge Manfred Lochs of Poland.
   In 1978, the United States requested the extradition from Chile
of Michael Townley, a U.S. citizen and an employee of the Chilean
intelligence service. He had been implicated in the murders.
   Chile complied and Townley was convicted and sentenced in a U.S.
court.

<HEAD>US Criticizes Soviet Bombing Raids Inside Afghanistan</HEAD>

   The United States on Tuesday criticized Soviet
bombing raids inside Afghanistan, accusing the Soviets of ``a clear
violation'' of understandings reached on its troop pullout.
   ``This pattern of daily bombardment is unacceptable,'' said State
Department spokesman Charles Redman. ``This is a clear violation of
Soviet assurances to us not to engage in offensive operations during
the withdrawal.''
   Speaking only three weeks prior to the mid-February deadline for
the Soviet troop pullout, Redman said the U.S. government still
expects the Soviet Union ``to be out by February 15th.''
   Redman noted that while the Afghan rebels, known as the
Mujahedeen, ``have been exercising restraint'' in permitting an
unhampered Soviet withdrawal, the Soviets have not.
   ``We believe that similar restraint would be appropriate on the
part of the Soviet Union,'' Redman said.
   While the guerrillas have halted attacks against the departing
Soviets, they have directed their pressure against the Soviet-backed
Marxist government of President Najib.
   The spokesman described the Soviet raids as ``a practice of heavy
bombardment of Afghanistan on a daily basis.'' In addition to
bombing runs conducted from bases in Afghanistan, ``numerous
sorties'' are being conducted each day from bases inside the Soviet
Union, Redman said.
   The targeted areas appear to include cities where no Soviet
forces are present, the spokesman said.
   Redman, who has voiced similar criticism over the past several
months, called the attacks ``very heavy bombardment ... aimed at the
Afghan people, in the form of the Mujahedeen. ... It just is counter
to what the Soviets have assured us that they would do.''
   The United States is a guarantor of the U.N.-mediated agreement
signed last April under which the Soviet Union is to remove all of
its military forces by Feb. 15.
   The Moslem guerrillas, now backed by Pakistan and the United
States, began fighting after a pro-Communist coup in April 1978.
   The Soviets entered the neighboring nation in December 1979 to
help the government battle the anti-Communist rebels. Its troops
were estimated to number 115,000 when the withdrawal began May 15.
   On Sunday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze ended a
three-day visit to Afghanistan after pledging arms supplies to
Najib's government when the remaining Soviet soldiers depart.
   Shevardnadze said the withdrawal would go ahead as scheduled and
that he believed Najib's government will cope with the insurgents on
its own.

<TEXT>
   Japan's Economic Planning Agency chief resigned
Tuesday, becoming the third Cabinet minister in less than two months
to fall victim to a major stock-trading scandal.
   Ken Harada stepped down after news reports said he had received
regular political donations from Recruit Co., the company at the
center of the stock scandal.
   Harada's resignation was a serious blow to Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita, who had reshuffled his Cabinet on Dec. 27 with a pledge
to restore public trust in political ethics.
   The Japan Socialist Party, the largest opposition group, quickly
called for Takeshita and the rest of the Cabinet to resign.
Opposition criticism of the administration also was expected to
delay parliamentary debate in coming weeks over the fiscal 1989
budget.
   Harada, 69, had chaired a special parliamentary committee
examining the stock-trading scandal until he was made the country's
chief economic planner in the Cabinet reshuffle.
   Harada submitted his resignation shortly after the Cabinet met to
approve the budget. Takeshita named Koichiro Aino, 60, a six-term
member of parliament and former vice foreign minister, to succeed
him.
   Harada is the second member of the new Cabinet to resign because
of links to the stock scandal. A member of the previous Cabinet,
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, also stepped down in early
December.
   The nationally circulated newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported
Tuesday that Harada had received about $80 a month from Recruit for
14 years. It said a Recruit subsidiary also had donated about $8,000
to a Harada fund-raising party in August.
   In a televised news conference following his resignation, Harada
acknowledged the donations, but denied any wrongdoing and said the
company had ``absolutely not asked for any favors'' in return.
   The Recruit scandal has rocked Japanese politics in the past half
year, with at least 16 top politicians acknowledging that they or
their aides benefited after being offered cheaply priced unlisted
shares in a Recruit subsidiary that rocketed in value soon after
public trading began.
   The shares reportedly were offered to more than 100 prominent
people, including politicians, businessmen and media officials.
   Neither the donations nor the stock transactions were illegal in
themselves, but questions of possible bribery, ethics and political
fund-raising practices have been raised.
   Only three days after Takeshita formed his new Cabinet in
December, Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa stepped down after it
was disclosed that he had received regular donations from Recruit.
   Earlier in the month, Miyazawa resigned after having repeatedly
changed his explanation of a close aide's purchase of the unlisted
shares.
   Hisashi Shinto, the chairman of Japan's largest company, Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, also stepped down in December after it was
disclosed that Recruit stock profits had been deposited in his
personal bank account.
   Harada's resignation was expected to put heavy pressure on
several other Cabinet members, including Takeshita himself, who have
links to Recruit.
   Takeshita has acknowledged that an aide and a relative profited
from the sale of the Recruit subsidiary's shares. News reports have
said Recruit's former chairman also donated about $38,000 to a
Takeshita political support group in 1987 and 1988.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi also reportedly received
about $160 a month from Recruit, and Agriculture Minister Tsutomu
Hata has acknowledged that Recruit bought tickets for a fund-raising
party in 1986 at an undisclosed price.
   Obuchi, who serves as chief government spokesman, said the
Cabinet would launch a thorough investigation into ties between
Recruit and Cabinet members.
   In an editorial in its Wednesday editions, the Asahi Shimbun
criticized Takeshita's Liberal Democratic Party for what the
newspaper called ``its lack of enthusiasm for establishing a code of
ethics for politicians and its lack of clear ideas about the proper
handling of political funds.''
   It added: ``The Cabinet shuffle of late last year ought to have
been aimed at restoring the nation's trust in politics, which was
sorely wounded by the scandal. Thus the nation expected the prime
minister to check thoroughly whether candidates for Cabinet
appointments had any relations with Recruit.
   ``As was the case with former Justice Minister Hasegawa, however,
we must say that the prime minister's character check was too
casual,'' the newspaper said.
   ``Of course, we are not saying that all political donations by
companies are wrong,'' it added. ``We merely urge that the kinds of
funds propping up political activities be fully disclosed.''

   Patriarch Vazgen I, leader of Armenia's Catholics,
has been nominated to run for a seat in the Soviet parliament, Tass
reported Tuesday.
   The Soviet news agency said the Armenian church leader won the
unanimous backing of a meeting of voters in the district of
Echmiadzin, the see of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Tass said he
is the first religious worker in the history of Soviet Armenia ever

   Vazgen is at least the second cleric nominated for a seat in the
new Congress of People's Deputies, a parliamentary body to be
elected March 26. A Russian Orthodox leader whose diocese includes
Leningrad and Estonia was nominated earlier.
   The congress will elect the national president, a post now held
by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and members of a full-time legislature.

   Pianist Van Cliburn will perform June 19
with the Philadelphia Orchestra, for his first major concert in more
than a decade.
   A spokesman at the Van Cliburn Foundation said Monday that
Cliburn, 54, will resume an active concert schedule with the concert
in Philadelphia with conductor Stanislaw Skrowaczewski.
   ``I'm very happy that Van is coming back to his career,''
Skrowaczewski said. ``Everyone has been very sorry that he wasn't
playing.''
   Cliburn, a native of Shreveport, La., spent his boyhood in the
east Texas town of Kilgore and rocketed to international fame in
1958 at 23 when he won first prize at the International Tchaikovsky

   Country music entertainer Lynn Anderson
has agreed to write a letter of apology if a waitress drops
malicious mischief charges she filed against the singer last fall,
authorities said.
   The charges stemmed from an incident Oct. 19 at the home of Miss
Anderson's former boyfriend, songwriter Mentor Wiliams.
   Miss Anderson, 41, country music's Female Vocalist of the Year in
1971, left the General Sessions Courtroom on Monday when her
attorney, William T. Ramsey, announced that Linda Gail Bowers had
agreed to drop the charges in exchange for a letter of apology.
   Ms. Bowers obtained the warrant against Miss Anderson after the
singer came to Williams' home in suburban West Meade, allegedly
broke into Ms. Bowers' car, took some of her belongings and made
threats against her.
   ``These charges have absolutely no merit,'' Miss Anderson said in
a statement at the time.
   Attorney Tom Kittrell Jr. said his client chose to drop the
charges ``rather than make everybody go through a protracted legal
process.''

   For actress Jensen Buchanan, a trip to school
seemed like a vacation.
   She and other cast members of ``One Life To Live'' are at Duke
University this week, filming episodes of the ABC-TV soap opera to
be broadcast next month.
   ``I'm trying to look at it like a vacation,'' Miss Buchanan said.
``There's a lot of pomp and circumstance for a little bit of
action.''
   In one episode, a gargoyle topples from a clock tower, narrowly
missing Bo and Sarah, played by Miss Buchanan. Was the gargoyle
intended for Bo or Sarah or for both?
   Miss Buchanan said she thought the gargoyle was intended for Bo,
played by Bob Woods. ``They haven't told us yet, but I think it's
his life. In the story line, about a week before this, there was a
car explosion that he narrowly escaped. Now a gargoyle, it gives you
the idea something is up.''

   When she was crowned Miss America four
months ago, Gretchen Carlson said her selection showed that the
pageant is interested in brains and talent, not just looks.
   ``It shows that I'm not a bimbo, that I do have intelligence and
that I do represent what every woman wants to be in this society,
which is a career woman, and be respected for her intelligence,''
said Carlson, a Stanford University junior from Anoka.
   Carlson appeared at a school in Minnetonka and the Childrens
Hospital of St. Paul on Monday. When she met Marcus Jackson, 15, at
the hospital, he looked at her hands and said, ``Miss America with
no fingernails?!''
   ``I know, isn't that refreshing?'' Carlson said, displaying her
close-trimmed nails.
   A violinist can't have long nails, said Carlson, who had just
returned from President Bush's inauguration in Washington. ``I put
on fake ones for the inauguration, but as soon as I got back to
Minnesota I ripped them off, because I had to practice.''

   Teetotaling Princess Diana on Tuesday blamed soap
operas featuring alcohol for influencing people to drink.
   Diana also told a former alcoholic at a rehabilitation center
that people find it strange that she does not drink socially.
   ``She said that when she switches on EastEnders or Coronation
Street the whole scene around those soap operas is drinking and pubs
and of course that is an influence,'' said Mike Abell, a former
resident at the center who now runs his own program to help
alcoholics.
   Diana, the center's patron, was referring to two popular British
soap operas, both of which feature scenes in pubs.
   She spent an hour Tuesday touring the Camberwell Alcohol Project,
a center run by Turning Point, the largest national voluntary
organization for people with drug, alcohol and mental health
problems.

   D.J. Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince have sold 2.5
million copies of their latest album, and the hot rap duo can be
heard all over the radio and television airwaves.
   That's not enough for some fans, who have been calling a 900
telephone number for daily recorded messages from the popular pair.
   The promotional gimmick helps sell more records, and the phone
royalties alone give the rich rappers extra income ``well into the
six figures,'' said Micahel L. Omansky, an RCA marketing executive
who came up with the idea.
   The number _ 900-909-5333 _ has been called more than 2 million
times since it was started in June. The average cost is $2.45 _ $2
for the first minute and 45 cents for each additional minute.
   For that, callers get a two-minute recorded message from one or
both rappers. Tuesday's offering, for instance, featured D.J. Jazzy
Jeff complaining about Fresh Prince's cooking _ though he conceded
his partner ``makes ice pretty decent ... it comes out and it's
cold.''
   One company, Phone Programs Inc., has produced more than a dozen
promotional numbers for pop acts. D.J. Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince
are the most popular, followed by Bobby Brown and Al Be Sure.

   Thirty-five House members wrote Speaker Jim
Wright on Tuesday to demand a vote on a proposed 50 percent
congressional pay raise ``out of respect for the American taxpayer.''
   The raise would become effective automatically Feb. 8 unless the
House and Senate defeated it in separate votes.
   The letter, written by Rep. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., was signed
by 30 Republicans and five Democrats.
   Wright, a Democrat from Texas, has been noncommittal about a
vote, and his office had no immediate comment on the letter.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, has promised
a vote on the pay plan.
   The plan would give rank-and-file lawmakers $135,000 a year,
instead of $89,500; allow the speaker to earn $175,000, instead of
$115,000; and pay $155,000 to the president pro tempore of the
Senate and the House and Senate majority and minority leaders of
both each house, all of whom now earn $99,500.
   ``The prospect of an increase in congressional salaries has
prompted a broad range of comments, but there is one theme that is
constant,'' the letter said. ``The American people are firm in their
conviction that regardless of the legislative form, there must be a
vote on this enormous pay raise.''
   The letter said that ``avoiding this issue is not the answer,''
and added the vote should be scheduled ``out of respect for the
American taxpayer.''
   Former President Reagan recommended in his budget message that
Congress, top federal political appointees and judges receive 50
percent pay raises.
   A vote would most likely come on a resolution of disapproval,
which could be written to strike down only the congressional portion.
   One scenario is that Congress could defeat the pay raise and then
pass legislation through normal procedures to set salaries at any
amount.
   Signing the letter were:
   Democrats Mike Synar, Oklahoma; G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery,
Mississippi; W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, Louisiana; Timothy J. Penny,
Minnesota, and Peter A. DeFazio, Oregon.
   Republicans Thomas J. Tauke, Iowa; Robert F. Smith, Oregon; Cass
Ballenger, North Carolina; Howard C. Nielson, Utah; Jim Courter, New
Jersey; Robert C. Smith, New Hampshire; Jim Bunning, Kentucky; Bob
Stump, Arizona; Peter Smith, Vermont; Olympia J. Snowe, Maine; Bill
Emerson, Missouri; John J. Rhodes III, Arizona, James M. Inhofe,
Oklahoma.
   Also, Republicans Helen Delich Bentley, Maryland, Dan Schaefer,
Colorado, Clyde C. Holloway, Louisiana, Norman D. Shumway,
California; Jim Leach, Iowa; Larry E. Craig, Idaho; Patricia F.
Saiki, Hawaii; Virginia Smith, Nebraska; Lamar S. Smith, Texas;
Craig T. James, Florida; Michael Bilirakis, Florida; Chuck Douglas,
New Hampshire; Denny Smith, Oregon; Thomas J. Ridge, Pennsylvania;

   The wives of three kidnapped American
professors appealed to their Moslem captors to release the men, who
on Tuesday began their third year in captivity.
   They also urged the administration of President Bush to do all it
could to obtain the release of their husbands, seized Jan. 24, 1987,
from the campus of the American-affiliated Beirut University
College, where they taught.
   ``We appeal to you (kidnappers) again to release our loved
ones,'' said Virginia Rose Steen, wife of journalism professor Alann
Steen of Boston. ``Two years have passed since we saw our husbands
abducted from this campus.''
   The women held a news conference on the campus to mark the second
anniversary of the kidnappings.
   Jesse Turner, a mathematics professor from Boise, Idaho, and
Robert Polhill, a business professor from New York City, were
abducted with Steen by unidentified gunmen posing as Lebanese police.
   Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian citizen and U.S. resident who was a
visiting professor of finance at the college, also was seized that
day but since has been freed.
   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are held hostage in
Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Mrs. Steen said the women had not yet made contact with the Bush
administration but hoped ``the new people with fresh ideas ... would
do everything they possibly can to end this for all the hostages.''
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, believed made up
of Moslem extremists, claimed responsibility for the kidnappings.
   The group initially demanded that Israel free 400 Arab prisoners
in return for the educators. Israel has refused to consider the
demand and Washington said it would not pressure the Jewish state to
change its position.
   The kidnappers, in a statement in September, appeared to soften
their demand by hinting they would consider freeing the men if the
United States backed a Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Let us end this horror now and make a positive step out of it.
... Let them love, breath and walk as you do,'' Mrs. Steen said.
   Polhill's wife, Feryal, said, ``Please release them and allow
them to help you. They will tell the world of your grievences and
will help you continue achieve your aims.''
   Badr Turner said of her husband, ``I wish he would return home
soon, along with his colleagues.''
   Turner's 19-month-old daughter, Joanne, who was born during his
captivity, sat in her mother's lap and waved to television cameras,
saying: ``Hello, daddy.''
   Mrs. Steen said there had been no word from the kidnapped
professors since Oct. 3, when Singh was released. At the time, the
kidnappers released pictures showing the others saying goodbye to
Singh.

<HEAD>Namibia Peacekeeping Force Cut; More Police Included</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet complaints about costs
forced U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Tuesday to
recommend that the United Nations slash its peacekeeping force for
Namibia to 4,650 troops.
   It will be the first U.N. attempt to guide a colony to
independence, and the world body's biggest and most expensive
peacekeeping mission since the 1960-64 Belgian Congo crisis.
   Perez de Cuellar estimated it will cost $416 million to deploy
the peacekeepers with about 800 election supervisors, an
undetermined number of civilian administrators and an augmented
force of 500 police supervisors.
   Black African and non-aligned nations for weeks have argued for
at least 7,500 troops, as indicated in a 1978 Security Council plan
for the independence of South-West Africa, better known as Namibia.
   That would have cost $700 million, U.N. officials said.
   But the Soviet Union and China abandoned their usual Third World
allies and agreed with the other permanent Security Council members
_ the United States, Britain and France _ that costs should be cut.
   Each of the five permanent members has the power to veto any
Security Council resolution, so Perez de Cuellar's report reflected
their wishes. His recommendations must go to the Security Council,
which is expected to approve.
   He suggested the Security Council keep the upper limit of the
peacekeeping contingent at 7,500, but dispatch only 4,650. Remaining
troops would be on standby in their home countries, he said.
   He authorized 500 police supervisors from U.N. member nations to
oversee the South African-trained Namibian police, who will remain
in charge of law and order during the transition to independence.
More police supervisors were needed because the police force has
nearly trebled in the past decade to a strength of 8,300, the
secretary-general said.
   At $416 million for one year, the Namibian mission will be more
expensive than the $375 million total cost of all other assessed
peacekeeping operations in 1988.
   The Congo peacekeeping mission cost $400 million from 1960-64, at
much higher dollar rates, and involved 19,828 soldiers at peak
strength.
   South Africa has administered Namibia since it captured the
mineral-rich colony from Germany in World War. Namibia's
independence comes through U.S.-brokered peace accords signed Dec.
22 by Angola, Cuba and South Africa.

<HEAD>Much of Winter Wheat Crop Still Lacks Moisture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lack of moisture continues to put stress on
much of the nation's winter wheat crop, particularly in the central
and southern Great Plains, a government report said Tuesday.
   The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said insect damage also
continued to damage wheat, along with the dry weather, during the
week of Jan. 16-22. The facility is operated by the agriculture and
commerce departments.
   ``In Kansas, winter wheat continued to show moisture stress,''
the report said. ``Greenbug damage was a continuing problem in the
southwest and southcentral areas'' of the state.
   The dry conditions were causing winter wheat in Oklahoma to turn
yellow, and mild temperatures have allowed greenbugs to multiply.
   Rain helped conditions in parts of Texas, but dry soils continued
to hurt winter grains in many areas, the report said. Greenbug
damage was apparent in many fields, too.
   ``Snow cover was needed in most of the northern plains,'' the
report said. ``Snow cover was adequate in North Dakota and portions
of South Dakota. Montana's winter wheat was mostly fair to good,
with only light wind damage.''
   The Oregon winter wheat crop was reported in mostly good
condition, and it was said to be in ``mostly good to fair'' shape in
the Corn Belt but lacked protective snow cover.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Suspect in Kidney Sales</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Tuesday charged a man with
brokering the sale of kidneys for use in transplants at an exclusive
London hospital, a public prosecutor said.
   Retired military officer Tunc Ay Kunter has ``confessed to acting
as a middleman for four such operations,'' but insists he acted for
humanitarian reasons, according to the prosecutor, Sait Erel.
   The arrest follows one man's charges that one of his kidneys was
removed without his knowledge or consent at London's private
Wellington Humana hospital, Erel said.
   Turks have been angered by reports that Turkish peasants were
selling their kidneys to wealthy recipients at the London hospital.
   Turkish law allows donations of human organs, but forbids their
sale. Sellers and organizers convicted in a kidney transaction could
be jailed for up to four years, Erel said.
   National television broadcast the charges Sunday that featured a
couple who said they each sold a kidney through a middleman to
recipients at a hospital.
   One kidney was sold for the equivalent of $5,600 and the other
for $3,200, the unidentified man and woman said on the program. They
did not identify the hospital or middleman.
   Erel said Kunter, 55, was picked up at his house Monday night and
was charged Tuesday after investiagors found evidence indicating
Kunter made money out of kidney transactions. Kunter said he
arranged them for humanitarian reasons and no money was involved.
   `It is not easy to believe that he has done them just for
humanitarian reasons,'' Erel said of Kunter's defense. ``He has been
involved in a long process of taking them (organ donors) to clinics,
having their passports issued and taking them to London for
nothing.''
   Legal proceedings started after one man, Ahmet Koc from
Dogubeyazit township in eastern Turkey, claimed in a Jan. 10 letter
that Kunter tricked him to go to the Wellington Humana hospital,
where one of his kidneys was removed without his consent.
   According to Erel, Koc claimed Kunter took him to the hospital
for what was described as a checkup linked to a job offer. After the
kidney was removed, Koc said, he was paid $4,637 by Kunter's brother
in London, Ata Nur.
   Erel said he could not start legal proceedings in other kidney
sales allegedly involving Kunter unless the donors applied to his
office.
   Wellington Humana hospital has said it has no evidence that Turks
were paid money to donate kidneys.
   However, it said it was reviewing its organ transplant procedures
following the British government's announcement of an investigation
into the case.

   Manslaughter charges against the officer accused of
killing a motorcyclist, touching off last week's racial violence,
will not calm the black community, leaders and residents said
Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, defenders of Officer William Lozano criticized the
charges, saying they were rushed without judicial review because of
racial tensions.
   Lozano, 29, was free on $10,000 bond after turning himself in
Monday at the Dade County Jail to face two counts of manslaughter in
the deaths of Clement Lloyd, 23, and Allan Blanchard, 24.
   Police said Lozano shot Lloyd in the head, killing him and
causing the motorcycle to crash into a car, fatally injuring
Blanchard, his passenger. A parallel federal civil rights
investigation into the killings was continuing Tuesday, U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said, but had not reached any conclusions.
   The state manslaughter charges did not sit well with many in
Overtown, which erupted into three days of riots after the Jan. 16
killing.
   ``They've only done that to keep the community quiet,'' said
Lloyd's father Lee Lloyd. ``But I don't think they are going to keep
the community quiet _ that's not enough.''
   Michael Wright, who manages an Overtown laundry, said he was
bitter about the charges and the bail.
   ``As long as they shoot us, they get manslaughter,'' said Wright.
``If we shoot one of them, it's first-degree murder, or if we shoot
a Cuban or a white, it's first-degree murder.''
   Miami's lone black city commissioner, Miller Dawkins, did not
criticize the charges against Lozano, but said they would not help
to calm Overtown.
   ``I don't think it's going to do anything until there is a trust,
a bonding in the community,'' the commissioner said.
   Miami police spokesman Ray Lang said that although bitterness
existed, there was no violence in the city following Lozano's arrest
and release.
   Lozano's defenders, however, said that the charges were a
political ploy and violated long-established rules set up precisely
to prevent police officers from being rushed to judgment because of
community reaction.
   ``There was no judicial review, there was no review by a grand
jury,'' said Lozano's attorney Roy Black. ``They decided to just go
ahead and arrest him and force him to post bail without any review
of the charges.''
   Dick Kinne, head of the 1,000-member Fraternal Order of Police,
said he was surprised by the speed of the investigation.
   ``I got a perception that this came a little faster than normal
because of the community's actions over the past week,'' Kinne said.
His organization planned to meet and decide if it will provide
financial support for the 29-year-old officer's support.
   Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno defended the manslaughter
counts and the investigation. An internal rule in Reno's office
calls for cases involving charges against police officers be brought
before an inquest if questions persist.
   ``If there is a question mark, we take it to an inquest. In this
instance investigators from both the Miami police department and
state attorney's office thought the charges should be filed and
manslaughter was the appropriate charge,'' she said.
   She also said her office could not determine the killing was
pre-meditated, as she would have to do in first-degree murder. Nor
could prosecutors show Lozano had committed an act ``evincing a
depraved mind,'' as second-degree murder charges would require.
   Some black leaders endorsed the charges, saying Ms. Reno had done
all she could under the law.
   ``It is not as glamorous as charges of some degree of murder, but
the fact is the penalties are similar enough,'' said George Knox, a
former city attorney.
   Maximum penalty for manslaughter with a firearm is 30 years in
prison. Second-degree murder can bring a life sentence.

<TEXT>
   Legislation to penalize nations that use
chemical weapons and private companies that help produce them will
be introduced this week, Republican and Democratic senators said
Tuesday.
   The proposed action was announced at a hearing in which senators
cited reports that the West German government had looked the other
way while German industries helped Middle East nations obtain
chemical warfare capability. A U.S. official said West Germany is
now addressing the situation.
   Senators also were told that the Soviet Union is stockpiling
biological weapons in violation of a 1972 agreement banning them
worldwide.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said he will soon introduce a bill to require
U.S. diplomatic and economic sanctions against any nation using
chemical or biological weapons. He said the legislation will ask
other nations to do likewise.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said he will sponsor companion
legislation to invoke sanctions against companies of any nationality
which supply chemical warfare equipment and technology to Third
World nations.
   ``I have every reason to believe that, in the end, the Congress
and the administration will see the wisdom of both approaches,''
Helms said.
   Helms and other members of the Foreign Relations Committee
complained about reports that West German officials ignored the
situation while German chemical firms helped Libya build a chemical
plant that has been alleged to be capable of producing poison gas.
   William F. Burns, the retired Army major general who heads the
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, testified that about 20 nations
have the capacity to produce chemical weapons, He said about five or
six are known to have used or stockpiled them.
   Responding to questions, Burns listed Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria
and North Korea as poison gas stockpilers. He said Iraq, Iran and
Libya are reported to have used chemical weapons.
   Burns also said the United States believes the Soviet Union is
maintaining stocks of biological weapons in violation of the 1972
international agreement outlawing the manufacture and possession of
lethal biological agents.
   ``We believe the Soviet Union does have a stock of biological
weapons and obviously they must have some capacity to produce
them,'' Burns said.
   Helms asked how, in that case, the Soviets can be trusted to
adhere to a new international agreement, soon to be negotiated,
banning the manufacture, stockpiling and use of poison gas and other
chemical weapons.
   Burns replied that the 1972 agreement had no provisions for
monitoring and verifying compliance while any new pact will have
verification provisions.
   He acknowleged, however, that verification will be difficult and
that perfect monitoring probably cannot be achieved.
   Helms complained that West German companies were helping Third
World countries, especially in the Middle East, obtain chemical
weapons capability.
   He also said a West German firm is helping Libya obtain the
ability to refuel warplanes in midflight, extending their range and
giving them the ability to strike Israel.
   ``The problem is extremely grim,'' Helms said. ``With the
critical assistance of Western industrial firms, the four most
radical regimes in the world are acquiring weapons of mass
destruction.''
   Burns, who said he had discussed the situation with officials of
the West German Embassy, said the attitude of the Bonn government
has changed significantly.
   ``I believe the West German government is addressing the
problem,'' Burns said. He predicted the West German government would
erect a much stronger system of export controls.

   A carnival atmosphere prevailed outside the
prison where Ted Bundy was executed Tuesday, as capital punishment
supporters hawked electric chair pins, sang macabre songs and
lighted sparklers.
   Nearly 100 death penalty supporters milled about a pasture at the
Florida State Prison, some even dancing over the demise of one of
the nation's most notorious killers.
   Corrections Department spokesman Bob Macmaster said the pre-dawn
crowd, including some 30 opponents of the death penalty and more
than 100 journalists, was larger than he had ever seen at an
execution.
   The frivolity offended foes of capital punishment and even some
who thought Bundy should die.
   ``I think it's fair to execute him. I just don't think it's fair
everyone is dancing around, having fun,'' said Bridgette Braswell of
Gainesville.
   ``I am shocked,'' said Anne-Marie Diller, also of Gainesvill, who
held a votive candle to protest the execution. ``I think people came
here like they were going to the fair. I'm shocked that people could
rejoice over someone's death, even if he is guilty.''
   The ``Old Sparky'' lapel pins first sold for $3 but later were
upped to $5 as the 7 a.m. execution approached.
   ``I'm here to support the death penalty. The pins are only a
sidelight,'' said the vendor, who wore a staw hat adorned with an
American flag. He said his name was Richard and that he worked in
law enforcement and did not want to give his last name for fear of
reprisals at work.
   Nearby, a man wearing a Ronald Reagan mask and a T-shirt that
read ``Toast Ted'' carried an effigy of Bundy in a noose.
   Asked to explain the joyous mood, death penalty supporter Jerry
Jackson said: ``A lot of people want to have a good time to get it
past them. It's been real heavy on a lot of people, especially on
communities in Florida.''
   About 15 people from Tallahassee, where Bundy killed two sorority
sisters at Florida State University 11 years ago, sang a song titled
``On Top of Old Sparky.'' At 7 a.m. they ignited sparklers and
hollered.
   ``If it doesn't do anything else, it's going to once and for all
get Ted Bundy out of the lives of the families he victimized,'' said
Wendy Nelson, who wore a shirt that read, ``Someone I love was
murdered.''
   Ms. Nelson's 10-year-old daughter, Elisa, was slain in 1980.
Larry Mann, convicted in the girl's death, has an appeal pending.
   ``It's not for me to critique them if they are enjoying it,'' she
said of the upbeat protesters.

   The active-duty strength of the nation's armed
forces continued to drop slowly last month, the Pentagon said
Tuesday.
   In all, the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force reported
2,121,142 men and women on active duty as of Dec. 31, down from
2,130,438 as of Nov. 30.
   On Dec. 31, 1987, there were 2,166,611 men and women in uniform.
   Most reductions in 1988 were made through changes in recruiting
goals, tighter re-enlistment standards and ``early out'' incentives.
   As of Dec. 31, the Navy said it had 582,692 people on active
duty, down 3,264 from Nov. 30. The Marine Corps said it had 195,027,
down 910 compared with the count on Nov. 30.
   The Army reported a decline of 6,074 to a total 765,037. The Air
Force said its active-duty strength climbed by 952 to 578,386 at the
end of December.

<HEAD>Officials: Evidence Shows Former Prime Minister Abducted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Police said Tuesday there was some hope
that former Prime Minister Paul Vanden Boeynants, abducted 10 days
ago, was still alive after a newspaper received his ID card and a
handwritten letter from him.
   ``We now have some hope to find Mr. Vanden Boeynants and to find
him alive,'' said prosecutor Andre Rutten. He addedd, however, that
``hope is still limited.''
   The Socialist Revolutionary Brigade sent Vanden Boeynants'
identity card and a letter investigators said was handwritten by him
to the Brussels daily Le Soir as proof it was holding the
69-year-old Christian Democrat. The group said in an accompanying
note that ``he is still alive.''
   Investigators spent most of Tuesday analyzing the documents.
   Vanden Boeynants disappeared Jan. 14 after he parked his car near
his home in a plush Brussels neighborhood. His hearing aid, pipe and
a shoe were found nearby, and the brigade claimed responsibility
hours later.
   The group said Tuesday he ``will appear free before the people''
if its demand for the equivalent of about $790,000 in ransom were
met.
   The brigade has said Vanden Boeynants' business and political
associates must pay the ransom, with two-thirds of the money going
to the poor and the rest to the group.
   Rutten said he did not know whether Vanden Boeynants' family
wanted to negotiate with the abductors, but that investigators would
not interfere. ``We are living in a free country,'' he said.
   Last week, a man claiming to belong to the brigade called the
investigators' crisis center and said Vanden Boeynants would be
returned ``in little pieces.''
   The brigade has said it would put Vanden Boeynants before a
``people's tribunal'' for what it called corruption and demagoguery.
``He is alive and will confess,'' said Tuesday's note from the group.
   The handwritten letter said he would ``make a statement to the
press shortly after my release saying I had to take the initiative
to give ... a large amount of aid to relief groups for the poorest
regardless of their politics, language or religious beliefs.''
   Most of the letter was illegible and one page was missing, Rutten
said.
   Vanden Boeynants' political career spanned 40 years and included
two terms as prime minister, from 1966-68 and from late 1978 until
early 1979. He also served as defense minister for seven years in
the 1970s.
   But he was disgraced by a tax fraud conviction in 1986. The
charges stemmed from his work as head of a meat-packing business.
Vanden Boeynants received a three-year suspended sentence and was
fined the equivalent of $16,850.
   He campaigned for the job of Brussels' mayor last year, but
withdrew after Prime Minister Wilfried Martens told Vanden Boeynants
his tax fraud conviction had tainted him too much.

   When a plane crashed Feb. 3, 1959, killing Buddy Holly, Ritchie
Valens and J.P. ``Big Bopper'' Richardson, there was little written
about the careers of the legendary rockers. Today, however, the
music world has realized the important contributions each made to
rock 'n' roll, especially Holly, whose death proved to be epochal.
   Upcoming shortly is a package of stories for Sunday, Jan. 29, by
David Bauder, Wendy E. Lane and Suzanne Gamboa, looking at the

Holly.

<TEXT>
   In the end, Ted Bundy's low-key, remorseful
departure Tuesday was as puzzling as the sharp contradiction of his
outgoing personality and his murderous, troubled depths.
   After he was executed in Florida's electric chair, Bundy's
steel-blue eyes stared straight ahead _ with scores of questions
remaining unanswered about his motives and unsolved cases, even
after his last-minute confessions to 20 murders.
   Bundy, a 42-year-old law school dropout, had defied the state of
Florida for 11 years, exuding wit and charm as he maneuvered his way
through the legal system.
   But when the state finally cornered him in the death chamber for
the murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach, a frightened Bundy went to
his death quietly.
   Bundy paused when he entered the freshly painted, gray death
chamber soon after 7 a.m. EST and appeared startled, his eyes
betraying fear.
   His head and right leg were shaved for the electrodes and each
wrist was manacled to a guard. He walked over and was seated in the
massive oaken electric chair, built by inmates in 1923.
   While thick leather straps were tightened around his legs, arms,
waist and chest by four prison officials, Bundy looked around the
room and mouthed some words to attorney James Coleman and the Rev.
Fred Lawrence, a Methodist minister from Gainesville.
   Lawrence had spent the night outside Bundy's cell. ``Part of the
time, they spent in prayer,'' said Bob Macmaster, prison spokesman.
   Coleman and Lawrence were seated on the front row, separated only
by a window from Bundy, about three feet away.
   Forty-two people witnessed the execution. They included 12
official witnesses, among them a state representative and three
state attorneys; 12 reporters; and 18 others, mostly corrections
officials.
   When Florida State Prison Superintendent Tom Barton asked Bundy
if he had anything to say, the inmate's voice broke slightly as he
spoke, looking at Coleman and Lawrence.
   ``Jim and Fred, I'd like you to give my love to my family and
friends,'' he said.
   Bundy's eyes widened when the chin strap was tightened. He closed
his eyes tightly for several seconds, then opened them, looking
straight ahead.
   A black leather hood was lowered in front of his face, and prison
officials attached a metal electrode to the top of Bundy's shaved
head.
   Barton walked to a telephone on the back wall of the death
chamber and spoke briefly with Gov. Bob Martinez in Tallahassee.
   Then he walked a couple of steps toward the black-hooded
executioner, partially visible through a slit behind a partition,
and nodded.
   The executioner, an anonymous individual paid $150 in cash,
pressed a button at 7:06 a.m. sending 2,000 volts at 14 amps surging
through Bundy's body.
   Bundy pressed backwards into the chair, unlike the violent,
jerking motion of inmates in many executions. His fists clenched.
   The power was on for about a minute, half the time normally
allowed to execute an inmate.
   A paramedic checked Bundy's pulse at his wrist for four minutes,
before unbuckling the strap and unbuttoning the inmate's shirt to
listen to the final beats of Bundy's heart.
   Dr. Frank Kilgo, chief physician at Florida State Prison, lifted
the mask from Bundy's face and shined a light into the cool eyes
that were staring straight ahead.
   ``He's dead,'' he said at 7:16 a.m.
   Prison Lt. Don Davis told reporters and the official witnesses:
``The sentence of the state of Florida vs. Theodore Bundy has been
carried out.''
   When a white hearse carrying Bundy's body left the prison, death
penalty supporters cheered and quickly dispersed.

   A mother faces a murder charge in the
malnutrition death of her 2{-year-old blind, deaf and retarded child
who was found dead on the same day a judge had put her in the
custody of the state.
   Bessie M. Clayton, 23, of Oxford, was charged Monday in the death
last week of Anginetta Clayton. She turned herself in Monday and was
being held at the Lafayette County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bond.
   Her lawyer, James Minor of Oxford, said Clayton would fight the
charge, but declined to discuss the case.
   Officials said the girl weighed less than 10 pounds. The average
weight for a 30-month-old girl is 30 pounds, according to medical
officials.
   Alvin Chambliss, an Oxford attorney who appeared at Ms. Clayton's
bond hearing Monday, contended the Claytons were an impoverished
family cut off from public medical, housing and food assistance.
   ``There are a lot of people to blame,'' Chambliss said. ``The
system broke down. To blame the mother is a travesty.''
   Linda Clayton, the woman's sister, said the child had been sick
since birth, had trouble eating and was unable to keep food down.
She said the child had been fed on Jan. 17, the day she died, but
didn't have proper medication.
   The girl lived with 13 other people in a mobile home owned by
Linda Clayton.
   Youth Court Referee William T. Sloan had given custody of Bessie
Clayton's five children to the state Department of Public Welfare on
Jan. 17 and left physical custody with the mother, said Lafayette
County Attorney Ed Roberts.
   In most cases legal custody means the children remain at home and
welfare officers monitor their condition.
   During the custody hearing, Linda Clayton came to the Justice
Court building to inform her sister that the child was sick. Court
officers said Bessie Clayton could not leave, Linda Clayton said.
   Roberts confirmed that Linda Clayton was not allowed to see her
sister during the hearing. The child died before her mother arrived
home.
   After the death, Sloan issued an order giving the state temporary
total custody of the other four children, Roberts said. He said it
did not appear the other children were malnourished.
   Another hearing is scheduled Jan. 31, he said.
   County medical examiner Buddy Roy said an autopsy determined the
child died of severe malnutrition and dehydration.

<HEAD>Man in Wheelchair Tries to Set Fire to Raphael Painting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man in a wheelchair hurled a flammable
liquid at a 16th century Raphael painting and tried to set it aflame
Tuesday, but Vatican Museum guards rescued the work, officials said.
   The guards extinguished the fire before it could reach the
Madonna of Foligno, said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   Police identified the man as Thomas Lange of Berlin, West
Germany, who had lived in Italy for about a year, the Italian news
agency ANSA reported.
   Navarro said he was ``showing signs of being handicapped, also
mentally.'' After questioning, Lange was taken to the mental health
department of Rome's San Filippo Neri hospital for examination.
   Lange, 31, attacked the work in the Vatican Picture Gallery at
about 9:40 a.m., struggling up from the wheelchair, opening a
container and hurling the liquid toward the painting, Navarro said.
   The man then threw a lighted match at the liquid, which had
splashed on the wall and the floor beneath the painting, Navarro
said. It caught fire but two museum guards immediately extinguished
the blaze, he said.
   The man also was carrying two spray bombs of the type used for
personal defense and another bottle of an unidentified liquid,
according to the Vatican spokesman.
   The Madonna of Foligno measures 10 feet by 6{ feet and was
painted in 1512-13. It shows the Madonna with child seated on clouds
above a sphere surrounded by cherubs. Below are shown saints John
the Baptist, Francis and Jerome. In the distance are the Umbrian
town of Foligno with a descending cannon ball and a rainbow
signifying peace.
   Museum officials removed the painting to check for smoke damage
but it was to be on display again Wednesday.
   Navarro said Lange had been seen several times recently at the
museum, which houses some of Raphael's most famous works. The man
had leg problems that made it difficult for him to walk, he said.
   Police were preparing a report for a judge, who would decide
whether to press charges, ANSA reported.
   The most serious vandalism against a Vatican work of art occurred
in 1972 when Hungarian-born Laszlo Toth battered Michelangelo's
famed Pieta with a hammer in St. Peter's Basilica. Toth, who
screamed ``I am Jesus Christ!'' as he attacked the statue, broke off
the Madonna's left arm and veil and dented the face. The masterpiece
was fully restored and is protected by bulletproof glass in the
basilica.

<HEAD>Prospect of Brown Victory Draws Secession Talk from Alabama Party
Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prospect that a Washington attorney who
played a prominent role in Jesse Jackson's campaign will be the next
Democratic Party chairman drew talk of secession Tuesday from an
Alabama party leader.
   John Baker said the election of Ronald Brown as national party
chairman would not be ``a sign the Democratic Party is getting
better.''
   A supporter of former Rep. Jim Jones of Oklahoma for the party
chairmanship, Baker said Brown's election would be a victory for the
liberal wing of the party.
   ``You can't secede from the national party, though, frankly, I
would,'' he said. ``We'd maintain our official formal affiliation in
name only.''
   ``I'm not sure that's what we need right now,'' said James
Ruvolo, the Ohio Democratic Party chairman and a supporter of
Michigan chairman Richard Wiener for the national post.
   ``Ron Brown will bring the party together,'' said his campaign
manager Carl Wagner. ``His bottom line is to enlarge the party to
build national and regional majorities to elect and re-elect
Democrats at every level.''
   ``Mr. Baker's remarks not only surprise me, but they make me very
sad,'' said Pat Eddington, a Democratic National Committee member
from Alabama.
   Mrs. Eddington said she is neutral in the contest for the
chairmanship and added, ``I have known Ron Brown for most of the 11
years I have served on the national committee and I have found him
always to be a team player who has paid his dues to the party. He is
also a very articulate and honorable person.''
   Seeking the chairmanship along with Brown, Jones and Wiener was
former Rep. James Stanton of Ohio. Former Rep. Michael Barnes of
Maryland dropped out of the race Monday and endorsed Brown.
   Wagner said: ``Ron has made it clear again and again that he will
win with solid support across the country.''
   He said that Brown already was receiving more support from
southerners than Paul G. Kirk Jr. got four years ago when he ran for
party chairman.
   Kirk won the post despite nearly total opposition from Southern
party leaders who objected to his ties to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass.
   But Kirk succeeded in winning over the southerners who were in
the forefront of an unsuccessful effort to convince him to serve a
second four-year term.
   The other three candidates conceded that Brown is the
front-runner in the contest that will be decided by a vote of the
national committee at a meeting in Washington on Feb. 10.
   If elected, Brown would become the first black named chairman of
either major national party.
   Brown was staff director of the Senate Judiciary Committee under
Kennedy's chairmanship. He served as Jackson's convention manager
and was widely credited with playing a key role in helping close the
convention with a show of unity between Jackson, who lost a bid for
the presidential nomination, and Michael Dukakis, the nominee.

<HEAD>Texas Tries End Run Around U.S.-European Dispute Over Hormone-Fed
Beef</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas is butting into a trans-Atlantic dispute
over hormone-treated beef by offering to provide the European
Economic Community with chemical-free beef from the Lone Star State.
   However, it was not clear Tuesday whether the United States,
which retaliated against a number of EEC products after the EEC
banned imports of U.S. hormone-treated meat, would allow Texas to
provide the beef.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture apparently has adopted a wait
and see attitude toward Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim
Hightower's offer to find a supply of hormone-free beef in Texas and
develop a certification procedure that would satisfy the EEC of the
meat's purity.
   But Lester Crawford, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, said there could be a catch for Texas: The state
can't legally label meat for export as hormone-free because a meat
label must be truthful and verifiable, yet he said he knows of no
test to verify whether cattle were fed growth hormones.
   All beef and poultry must be federally inspected to go overseas,
he said.
   Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural
Service, said he's not sure whether the federal government could
stop the EEC from making a deal with Texas.
   ``It's a matter of Texas being able to get the certification the
European Community wants, versus whatever certification the U.S. can
give,'' Kay said.
   Ella Krucoff, spokeswoman for Sir Roy Denman, head of EEC
delegation in Washington, said she knew of no federal law that would
bar the shipments.
   ``Texas solicited us and we are responding,'' she said.``We're
trying to respond favorably to maintain the trade. We haven't got a
legal opinion _ that's up to the U.S. authorities.''
   Texas got little support from the American Farm Bureau
Federation. The federation contended the proposal weakens the U.S.
position in dealing with the entire issue of trade restraints with
Europe, said Paul Drazek, an international trade specialist for the
country's largest farm group.
   Europe contends the hormones, used to fatten growing cattle, are
a health threat, which the United States disputes. After Europe
banned the beef imports, affecting about $100 million in beef and
beef byproducts, the United States retaliated by setting about $100
million worth of higher tariffs on a variety of products from the
Common Market.

   Mountain villagers in ``endless'' funeral
processions Tuesday buried their dead from the Tadzhikistan
earthquake that killed up to 1,000, and rescuers slogged through
muddy rubble in a desperate search for survivors.
   New warnings were issued for more possible landslides caused by
thawing snow in the Central Asian republic 1,800 miles south of
Moscow that was hit by Monday's predawn earthquake.
   In northwestern Armenia, which was devastated by a Dec. 7 quake
that killed 25,000 people, a powerful aftershock was reported
Tuesday. An Armenian official said the population had been warned
and no casualties were reported.
   Rescuers reportedly found one survivor from the Tadzhikistan
quake, although an official spokesman denied it.
   A 40-second tremor, which U.S. seismologists registered as 5.4 on
the Richter scale, hit before dawn Monday. It loosened layers of mud
that cascaded onto mountain villages in a rural area about 20 miles
southwest of the republic's capital of Dushanbe.
   Workers using shovels and bulldozers continued digging for
survivors, Tass said, but a local official said the efforts might be
in vain.
   ``There is little hope because of the flood of dirt and mud,''
Erkin Kasymov, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of Tadzhikistan,
said by telephone. ``But while there is any hope, the rescuers will
keep digging.''
   In one village, Sharora, more than 100 bodies have been hauled
from the mud and wreckage, Tass said. It said rescuers found only
one survivor, Sergei Muratov, 27.
   Muratov, reported to be in grave condition, was rushed to a
hospital, where ``surgeons are fighting for his life,'' Tass said.
   However, Vitaly Zhukov of the republic's official news agency and
chief of a press information center set up in the wake of the
tragedy, told The Associated Press no survivors were found during
excavations Tuesday.
   Zainiddin Nasreddinov, editor-in-chief of the news agency,
estimated that about 600 people, or about Sharora's entire
population, had been killed in the village.
   Tass on Monday estimated that 1,000 people had been killed, and
official reports said more than 100 people were hospitalized in
Dushanbe.
   The predominantly Moslem villagers buried their dead, and ``the
funeral processions seem endless,'' the Tass news agency said.
   Zhukov said 11 people died overnight in hospitals. Late Tuesday,
amid reports that casualties might not be as high as initially
reported, he said the preliminary estimate remained at 1,000 dead.
   He added, however, that it was still too early to determine how
many people had been buried in the slide.
   Sharora and three other villages located at the quake's epicenter
_ Okuli-Bolo, Okuli-Poyen and Khisor _ are now wreathed in the smoke
of bonfires and field kitchens, Tass said.
   Zhukov said the republic will need about 400 prefabricated houses
for survivors in the stricken villages. He told The AP, however,
that although several neighboring republics and rescue teams from
Armenia had offered assistance, local authorities had not yet
determined just what help would be needed.
   Tass said the Soviet Red Cross sent a planeload of relief
supplies to the region and that the Armenian Red Cross announced it
would send a rescue team to Tadzhikistan. The plane carried four
tons of tents, clothing, blankets, household goods and medical
supplies, the news agency said.
   The television news program ``Vremya'' said a special bank
account had been set up in Moscow to accept voluntary contributions
to aid quake victims.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda blamed heavy snows
followed by a thaw for saturating the Babatag hills overlooking the
villages of Sharora, Okuli-Bolo and Okuli-Poyen, and said much of
the mud was carried to the villages by an earthen canal.
   Pravda said the soil in the canal's walls was saturated with
moisture, and that when the quake hit, it ``moved in a huge mass
onto the villages.''
   ``There is a danger of new mudslides in similar places in the
event of a new natural blow,'' the Communist Party paper said.
   Ruben Karagyosyan, a spokesman for the official Politburo
commission created to direct the relief effort for the Armenian
earthquake, said 10 aftershocks had been registered Monday night and
Tuesday morning, including one the same magnitude as Tadzhikistan's
quake.
   Tass said the epicenter of the aftershock, which occurred at 5:30
a.m. Moscow time (9:30 p.m. EST Monday), was northwest of Kirovakan,
one of the Armenian cities heavily damaged by the Dec. 7 quake.
   ``Our scientists had already warned the government and the
population over television and through the press that aftershocks in
the zone of the quake were predicted,'' Karagyosyan said in a
telephone interview from Yerevan, Armenia's capital.
   Residents of the quake zone had been warned not to congregate in
kindergartens, schools and other buildings, he said. ``So there were
no serious consequences.'' He said no deaths or injuries had been
reported.
   Powerful aftershocks were registered in Armenia on Dec. 31 and
Jan. 4, Karagyosyan said.

<HEAD>Mayor Teddy Kollek Running For Sixth Term in Jerusalem</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Teddy Kollek announced Tuesday he will run
for a sixth term in increasingly tense Jerusalem, the Arab and
Jewish city where he has championed unity for 23 years.
   ``One day I hope Arabs will also participate in elections,''
Kollek says. ``This is a united city and will remain a united city,
with equal rights to Arabs.''
   As part of his campaign platform for the Feb. 28 election, Kollek
promises to continue providing equal services to Jewish and Arab
parts of the city.
   The 77-year-old mayor has faced increasing urban tension in the
past year as Palestinian riots erupted in Arab east Jerusalem.
   Palestinians in East Jerusalem generally have not run for the
council and most do not exercise their right to vote. The number
voting this year is expected to drop even further because of the
uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, now in its 13th month.
   Jerusalem police have clamped curfews on Arab neighborhoods on at
least three separate occasions during the past year, and there have
been numerous rock and firebomb attacks on Israelis.
   Police, however, have refrained from using live ammunition during
protests, and there has been only one Arab death in East Jerusalem
compared with 367 in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Kollek on Tuesday denied he initiated a recent proposal to move
Arab polling booths to West Jerusalem in an attempt to attract
moderate Palestinians who wish to vote away from the eyes of
militant neighbors who oppose participation. The proposal has been
scrapped.
   The popular mayor is virtually guaranteed to win another
five-year term in office, but he faces an uphill battle to hold on
to his narrow majority in the 31-member City Council, where
ultra-Orthodox and right-wing elements control almost half the seats.

   President Bush jokingly asked House Speaker Jim
Wright on Tuesday why a gift bottle of Texas hot sauce bore a
made-in-North Carolina label _ and got a sizzling reply.
   ``Same way that some Texans were born in Kennebunkport,'' said
Wright, D-Texas.
   It was a reference to the oceanside resort town in Maine where
the Bush family maintains a vacation home. Actually, Bush was born
in Milton, Mass., and grew up in Connecticut before declaring Texas
his adopted state.
   Bush was presented the hot sauce, ``Texas Pete,'' manufactured in
Winston-Salem, N.C., and a jar of pork rinds by Wright and other
congressional leaders at a White House meeting called by Bush to
promote political peace.
   ``Just lovely,'' Bush said of the gifts. Pork rinds are a
favorite snack of the president's, and he smothers much of his food
with hot pepper sauce.
   ``We want to give a very warm welcome to the president,'' Wright
quipped.

<HEAD>Democrats, Hatch Unveil Revised $2.5 Billion Child-Care Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic senators joined a conservative
Republican Tuesday in introducing a revised $2.5 billion child-care
package aimed at satisfying President Bush and the GOP lawmakers who
blocked an earlier version.
   ``On behalf of America's children, we senators have extended a
political olive branch,'' said Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn.,
chief sponsor of the measure. He predicted the bill would serve as
the basis for an eventual compromise that could win congressional
passage and be signed by the new president.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``We still have some differing
views, but we agree that it is time to address the growing concern
of millions of American families over the lack of affordable,
quality child care.''
   ``I am not co-sponsoring this bill because I think it is a
perfect solution,'' Hatch said. ``Rather, it signals the
continuation of the discussions we began last fall.''
   He said differences remain over financing and establishing
child-care standards.
   The legislation is based on last year's Act for Better Child Care
Services, which was designed to help low-income Americans pay for
child care, to expand the supply of child care and to assure minimum
standards of health, safety and staff training at child-care centers.
   Following months of negotiations between Hatch and Democratic
senators led by Dodd, the lawmakers added new provisions that would
give states more of the money to improve the quality and
availability of child care. The amount of aid going directly to
families decreases from 75 percent to 70 percent.
   The revised bill also would make grandparents, aunts and uncles
eligible for reimbursement; provide grants and loans to family
day-care and non-profit providers to establish and expand programs;
create a state-based revolving loan fund for new family providers,
and increase participation by state and local officials, employers
and religious groups on an advisory committee that will recommend
minimum standards.
   ``We're willing to compromise because it's in America's best
interests,'' said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., who described
likened the lengthy negotiations to ``being in a bunker.''
   Dodd, who was bitterly disappointed last October when Republicans
held up the child-care legislation, said negotiations since last
year's defeat had produced ``a remarkable degree of onsensus.''
   He also expressed optimism over the change at the White House,
calling the Bush administration's attitudes on child care ``180
degrees different'' from the Reagan administration's.
   Dodd said, ``We have a new president who wants a kinder and
gentler nation and is willing to invest the money to make it happen.
We have a new leadership in the Senate which is committed to
enacting a child-care bill this year. And right here in the Labor
Committee we have an opportunity for the kind of bipartisan
cooperation which comes along rarely in a politician's career.''
   During the presidential campaign, Democrat Michael Dukakis backed
the Democratic bill while Bush proposed tax credits for families,
which could be used either to pay for outside child care or to
enable a mother to stay home instead of working.
   Dodd, speaking at a news conference with Hatch, said he will back
the Utah Republican's legislation for a tax credit but the Democrat
said such a plan was only part of the solution.
   ``It would not help this nation with our real challenge in the
child care arena _ to build a diverse system of child-care providers
with predictable standards of health and safety,'' Dodd said.

<HEAD>NBC Wins Ratings Again With Big Super Bowl Boost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's coverage of the Super Bowl game far
outdistanced all other shows in the Nielsen television ratings for
the week ended Jan. 22., keeping the network in the No. 1. spot for
the 31st consecutive week.
   The football game, in which the San Francisco 49ers defeated the
Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16, pulled a rating of 44.6 and a 66 percent
share of the audience watching television. That means more than 40
million homes tuned in.
   The postgame show was second in the weekly A.C. Nielsen Co.
ratings, with 32.5 and a 49 share.
   The ratings figures were provided by CBS. Although all networks
receive the same raw ratings data from Nielsen, each network may
interpret the results differently. NBC's interpretation gave its
Super Bowl game coverage a 43.5 rating and a 68 share.
   The nearest regular show was NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' which was
third, with a rating of 25.3 and a 39 share. In all, NBC had eight
of the Top 10 shows and handily won the week.
   ABC's ``Roseanne,'' the biggest new hit of the season, was fifth
behind NBC's fourth-place ``Cheers.'' ABC's ``Who's the Boss?'' was
sixth, as ABC came in second.
   CBS, which placed third, had only one show in the Top 20. Its
coverage of the inaugural gala in Washington was 20th. Its usually
high-rated Sunday show, ``Murder, She Wrote,'' was knocked to 46th
place by the Super Bowl coverage.
   Other shows in the Top 10, all NBC: ``A Different World,''
seventh place; ``Golden Girls,'' eighth; ``Brotherhood of the
Rose,'' Part I, ninth; and ``L.A. Law,'' tenth. ``Cosby,'' ``Who's
the Boss?,'' ``A Different World'' and ``Golden Girls'' were all
reruns.
   NBC won the week with an average of 20.0. ABC was second with
12.1 and CBS was third with 12.0.
   In the season to date, NBC is first with 15.6, ABC is second with
13.0, and CBS is third with 12.4.
   Each ratings point equals 904,000 homes with television. The
share is a percentage of the sets in use.
   The premiere of NBC's ``Father Dowling Mysteries'' was in 33rd
place, while the premiere of CBS' ``Dolphin Cove'' was 49th. A
preview of NBC's ``Nightingales'' placed 24th and a preview of ABC's
``A Fine Romance'' was 56th.
   The ABC movie ``The Ryan White Story'' was 21st in the ratings,
and Bob Hope's Super Bowl special was 29th.
   NBC also won seven places in the second 10 shows. The rank: NBC's
``Unsolved Mysteries,'' ABC's ``Growing Pains,'' NBC's ``In the Heat
of the Night,'' NBC's ``Dear John,'' ABC's ``Head of the Class,''
NBC's ``Matlock,'' NBC's ``ALF,'' NBC's movie ``The Cover Girl and
the Cop,'' NBC's ``Night Court'' and CBS' ``Inaugural Gala.''
   The three network nightly news shows were in a close race: ABC
first with a rating of 11.7, CBS second with 11.6, and NBC third
with 11.5.
   The lowest-rated show of the week was CBS's ``TV 101.'' The
bottom five shows in descending order were: ABC's ``All-Star Salute
to the Reagans,'' ABC's ``Knightwatch,'' CBS' ``Viva Miami: Super
Sounds,'' ABC's movie ``Herbie Goes Bananas'' and ``TV 101.''

<TEXT>
   George Bush interrupted his second full working
day at the White House Tuesday to take his first presidential jog,
running for 23 minutes on the grounds of a nearby Army base.
   It took a motorcade of 15 cars to get the president from the
White House to Fort McNair, a distance of about two miles. At Bush's
request, the motorcade did something presidential motorcades almost
never do: It stopped at red traffic lights along the way.
   Bruce Zanca, an aide to Bush, said the president was merely
following a practice he established as vice president. ``Mr. Bush's
preference as vice president was to stop at lights, keep things as
normal as possible,'' Zanca said.
   As vice president, Bush jogged for 20 minutes every second or
third day. But he usually did so on the sprawling grounds of the
vice presidential residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory.
   There is not nearly as much room at the White House compound.
   The president ran in bright orange jogging pants and a gray
long-sleeved top. With the temperature in the high 50s _ unusually
balmy for January in Washington _ Bush was perspiring lightly as he
finished his run.
   When a reporter suggested he was taking it fairly slowly, the
president responded, ``Wouldn't know it from watching the speed of
this thing.'' It was an apparent reference to his limousine, which
was being driven slightly ahead of him as he neared the end of his
jog.

<HEAD>Palestinian Killed, 18 Wounded; Rabin Considers New Steps</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Tuesday was
considering new measures to stop the Palestinian uprising, including
blocking Palestinians suspected of taking part in riots from
entering Israel.
   Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian teen-ager in a
predawn raid on a West Bank village, and at least 18 Palestinians
were shot in clashes with troops.
   Several Israeli newspapers reported that a secret army report
said the 13-month rebellion in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip would go on all year and that the violence could
intensify.
   The assessment, reportedly compiled by senior officers, said the
revolt could not be halted by military means because troops already
were doing all they could without resorting to unacceptable levels
of violence.
   Israel radio reported that Rabin was considering a policy to
block suspected rioters from entering Israel but said he had not
decided whether to adopt it.
   Work in Israel is the main source of income for an estimated
100,000 people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Rabin's policies for ending the uprising came under renewed
criticism Tuesday in a letter two dailies printed from an
unidentified reserve soldier who said service in the occupied lands
was a ``nightmare.''
   ``I'm helpless against my feelings and wonder if that's what I
was raised for by my parents, survivors of the terrible Holocaust,''
said the letter.
   Last week, soldiers complained to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
that they were forced to beat Palestinians to keep order.
   The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which oversees
Palestinian refugees, issued a statement expressing concern over the
``continuing toll of casualties'' and the indefinite closure of all
1,200 West Bank schools.
   Israel radio quoted Rabin as saying the school closures, ordered
Friday, were helping reduce casualties because classrooms served as
hotbeds for protests.
   At least 18 Palestinians were reported shot in clashes that
erupted during a general strike called by the PLO-backed leadership
of the uprising to protest the military's policies in the occupied
territories.
   In the Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said 16 people were
wounded in clashes despite an army curfew ordering 200,000
Palestinians to stay home. The wounded included a 12-year-old boy
said to be in serious condition with a bullet wound to the head.
   In the West Bank, a teen-ager was reported shot in the head in a
clash with soldier at refugee camp No. 1 near Nablus.
   Soldiers raiding the West Bank village of Habla were met by a
squad of masked Arabs and killed one of them in pursuit, military
officials said. Another Palestinian was wounded, and four managed to
escape, the officials said.
   The army confirmed the Habla incident and said one Palestinian
was wounded in the West Bank. Officials said they were checking the
other reports.
   The family identified the dead youth as Issam Hashem El-Marabi,
19, and said he had been shot several times in the head and chest.
   The death raised to 368 the number of Palestinians killed since
the rebellion against Israel's 21-year occupation began in December
1987. Fifteen Israelis also have died.
   In the West Bank settlement of Ginot Shomron, a firebomb was
thrown at an Israeli car, but it exploded on the street and caused
no damage, Israel radio reported.
   Shin Bet security agents, meanwhile, arrested dozens of Arabs
suspected of belonging to the so-called Palestinian Popular Army,
the military command said.
   Israel radio said the group was led by Arafat's mainstream PLO
faction Fatah and supplied weapons for attacks on Israeli soldiers
and civilians.
   The radio did not mention the type or quantity of weapons
involved, and an army spokesman said he was unable to provide
details.
   Palestinians have maintained the ``army'' exists mainly on paper
and has no guns. Several marches by youths calling themselves such
an army have been held recently in West Bank villages, with some
marchers carrying sticks, axes and knives.

<TEXT>
   The capital launched its celebration of the
bicentennial of the French Revolution on Tuesday night with
fireworks, trumpets and balloons at the Place de la Concorde, where
King Louis XVI lost his head to the guillotine.
   For the occasion, the large statues of eight women representing
eight major provincial cities placed around the huge square were
unveiled. The statues were restored over the past year to repair
effects of pollution made worse by the daily packs of automobiles
that jam the Place de la Concorde.
   As the horns sounded and floodlights blazed, a brief cascade of
fireworks lighted the sky over central Paris.
   The date chosen to kick off the city's bicentennial celebrations
Paris marked the 200th anniversary of Louis XVI's decision to summon
the Estates General, representatives of the three estates ``nobles,
clergy and commoners'' whose meeting in Versailles set the
revolution in motion.
   The king himself was beheaded Jan. 21, 1793, in the 21-acre
square on the Right Bank of the Seine between the Tuileries Gardens
and the Champs Elysees. It was first called Place Louis XV, renamed
Place de la Revolution in 1792, then Place Louis XV when the
monarchy was restored. It finally was given its current name in 1830
in homage to national reconciliation.
   The eight statues around the Place de la Concorde, installed
between 1836 and 1840, represent the cities of Nantes, Brest, Rouen,
Bordeaux, Marseille, Lille, Lyon and Strasbourg.
   Celebrations of the bicentennial year elsewhere in France started
as early as Jan. 1, with the launching of colorful hot-air balloons
from various sites.
   The celebrations are to culminate July 14, the national holiday
and the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison. Other
projects include concerts, festivals, expositions and, on the first
day of spring, planting of Trees of Liberty around the country.

<HEAD>All Senior Administration Officials to be Briefed on Ethics Policy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday asked the head of the
Office of Government Ethics to brief all senior administration
officials on ethical and conflict-of-interest standards required of
them, the White House said.
   Bush, who has pledged to make government ethics a high priority
in his administration, accepted OGE Director Frank Nebeker's offer
of Nov. 9 that Nebeker arrange for personal briefings of senior
officials and White House staff members to let them know the
guidelines on such matters as outside income, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The idea of such briefings was one that Bush proposed during his
campaign.
   Bush, who has charged his legal counsel, Boyden Gray, with
coordinating the ethics policy, has scheduled an activity on the
ethics issue each day this week. Fitzwater acknowledged that
Tuesday's meeting wtih Nebeker, which lasted just 10 minutes, was
symbolic and intended to keep the spotlight on the ethics issue.
   On Wednesday, Bush was to officially name members of an advisory
commission on ethics, Fitzwater said. The advisory commission was to
be created by executive order and chaired by Griffin Bell, the
former attorney general in the Carter administration, and Malcolm
Wilkey, a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington,
White House officials have said.
   On Thursday the president will meet with senior executive
employees to ``emphasize the ethics provisions of the law and their
responsibilities and what he expects of them.''
   He made a similar speech on Monday to White House appointees and
to his Cabinet, saying he wanted to avoid even the appearance of
impropriety.
   On Friday, Fitzwater said Bush will talk to the inspectors
general of the government departments to emphasize their role in the
ethics area and stress how much importance he is placing on the
matter.
   The Reagan administration was tarnished with allegations of a
``sleaze factor'' because of the many officials who were accused of
wrongdoing and unethical conduct. Bush repeatedly has attempted to
stress that he wants an administraiton that will avoid that kind of
reproach.
   However, Bush, as vice president, supported President Reagan's
veto of ethics legislation passed by Congress last year. He has said
he wants to introduce his own package.
   The task of Bush's commission will be to recommend what should be
in that legislation. Bush has said he wants the same standards that
are set for the executive branch to apply to Congress where
applicable.
   He made many recommendations during his campaign last year for
ethics revisions, including the naming of a senior presidential
counselor on the issue, and establishing an ethics office and staff
in each cabinet department and agency.
   Among the other members of the seven-member commission will be
former White House counsels Fred Fielding and Lloyd Cutler, and
Washington attorney Jan Baran, said White House spokeswoman Alixe
Glen.

   Four major veterans organizations, saying
``service to veterans is at an all-time low,'' called Tuesday for
substantial new spending for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
   In a detailed proposal, the groups said the final Reagan
administration budget proposal of $28.6 billion for the department
should be increased by $3.5 billion, with half that amount going to
the veterans medical system.
   The ``independent budget'' proposal for veterans programs was
released by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American
Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the American
Veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam, known as Amvets.
   They contend the budget for veterans programs for the current
fiscal year is insufficient to continue operating veterans hospitals
and other programs at current levels. They said former President
Reagan's budget proposal for fiscal 1990 falls even shorter and
would force the elimination of VA hospital and nursing beds, a
reduction in medical services and a loss of 5,000 jobs.
   ``By any standard, service to veterans is at an all-time low,''
the document said.
   The Bush administration has not yet issued its version of a 1990
budget proposal.
   The department, formerly known as the Veterans Administration,
operates the nation's largest system of hospitals and other medical
facilities.
   The document reflects frustration among advocates for veterans
with overall federal budget constraints that have limited
appropriations for the VA and brought reductions in VA medical
services.
   The veterans groups have directed much of their criticism at the
White House's Office of Management and Budget, and the new
independent budget proposal continues that. In a prologue, the
groups said their document ``connotes a final loss of confidence in
OMB's intention or ability to address veterans' issues objectively
or to support the moral and legal obligations that this nation has
accorded the men and women who have served our country.''

   An elderly couple whose day fishing trip
turned into three days at sea and nearly two on an uninhabited
island before they were rescued will stay in a hospital for several
days, officials said Tuesday.
   A spokesman for Beaufort Memorial Hospital said Thomas Pettigrew,
81, was in stable condition and was being kept for observation.
Hospital officials said he may have suffered a heart attack on the
boat or the island.
   Pettigrew's 80-year-old wife, Katie, was released from the
hospital Tuesday but will remain with her husband in his room.
   The couple left Charleston on their 18-foot fiberglass boat
Thursday for the fishing trip.
   The boat was blown out to sea and, after being tossed about in
12-foot waves, washed up late Saturday on Bay Point Island about 50
miles southwest of Charleston.
   The couple, who left with only enough food for one day, was
rescued by a Marine helicopter on a training mission late Monday
afternoon.
   The Coast Guard searched for the couple through high seas and
from the air from Friday through late Sunday, when the effort was
called off.
   The helicopter took them to the hospital. They originally
suffered from dehydration and exposure. They said they had drank sea
water to moisten their mouths.
   Pettigrew, a retired security officer, said Tuesday, ``I wasn't
afraid of anything. I had my .38 (caliber pistol) with me _ my
ex-service revolver.''
   He said seeing the Marine helicopter late Monday ``was worth all
the tea in China.''
   A helicopter passed over the couple late Saturday after they
washed ashore but didn't see them. They were able to flag down the
chopper Monday by using a white flag they had fashioned out of rags.
   ``The helicopter circled around and I kept waving,'' Mrs.
Pettigrew said. ``It seemed like heaven had opened up.
   ``We prayed a lot. There was nothing out there but the sky and
water,'' she said.
   Pettigrew said he built a bonfire when their boat washed up on
the island and while planes went over ``we couldn't get a hold of
anybody. The area we were in _ nobody goes by out there.''
   The only animals the couple saw on the island were goats. Lt.
Quain Kahler of the Charleston Coast Guard Base said a caretaker's
cottage with food was about 500 yards off the beach, but the couple
didn't find it.

   A depiction of children who watch too much
television as ``couch potatoes'' has drawn a tongue-in-cheek yelp of
protest _ that potatoes deserve better.
   In October, the American Academy of Pediatrics began broadcasting
nationwide an animated public service announcement depicting two
children sitting on a couch watching television.
   ``Couch potato, too much TV couch potato, avoid this dreaded
disease,'' is sung in the background.
   Peter Kress, public relations director of the Maine Department of
Agriculture, fired off a letter to the academy and the networks,
saying he wanted them to know that potatoes are good food.
   ``We simply had to let you know that potatoes and potato people
are not lacking in nutritional or personal energy,'' he wrote. ``We
appeal to you to reconsider using the couch potato reference.''
   After all, potatoes are Maine's largest cash crop. More than 2.3
billion pounds of spuds are harvested each year, reaping $98.8
million for the state's farmers, who don't spend a lot of time on
the couch.
   Michele Weber, a spokeswoman for the Illinois-based academy,
noted her group did not coin the phrase ``couch potato'' and said
the commercial was not intended to offend anyone.

   A dozen environmental groups urged President
Bush on Tuesday to review an Interior Department recommendation
favoring oil exploration in a vast Arctic wildlife refuge, calling
the issue a ``litmus test'' on Bush's intentions toward the
environment.
   In the final days of the Reagan administration, Interior
Secretary Donald P. Hodel formally urged Congress to clear the way
for oil and gas development in the environmentally important Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska.
   The oil industry has been pushing for years to open up the refuge
for drilling, believing the refuge's 1.5 million acre coastal
stretch has huge deposits of oil and gas.
   Crove opening up the land for drilling, and the
Interior Department recommendation is expected to be influential on
Capitol Hilongress must appl. Hodel suggested a land swap of tens of thousands
of
acres as the best way to open up parts of the refuge for drilling.
   Hodel's action last week at the end of his tenure as interior
secretary infuriated the environmental movement, which has vowed to
fight any attack on the refuge _ home for the Porcupine caribou,
polar bears and millions of birds.
   Officials representing 12 of the country's largest conservation
and environmental groups announced at a news confest
important environmental issues of 1989.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle will be the first
Bush administration representative to make an official foreign
visit, going next week to Venezuela and El Salvador, the White House
announced Tuesday.
   The Feb. 1-3 trip was timed so that Quayle can attend the
presidential inaguration of Venezuela's Carlos Andres Perez on Feb.
2.
   Others scheduled to attend the inauguration are Cuban President
Fidel Castro and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
   Other details were sketchy, and Quayle's chief of staff Robert
Guttman said it was still being determined what individuals Quayle
would meet during his brief El Salvador stop.
   He is to arrive in and leave the Central American nation on Feb.
3.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the El Salvador
stop was added so that Quayle could discuss the elections there in
March, and ``extend the best wishes of President Bush who has known
President (Jose Napoleon) Duarte for a number of years and meet with
other officials as appropriate.''
   Fitzwater said Quayle would express the concern for ``the
democratic process there and seeing it continue as it has under
President Duarte. We have concern about the guerrilla activity in El
Salvador and any threats that that may have in the election process
and I'm sure the vice president will discuss that with him.''
   The Salvadorean elections are March 19. Duarte is
constitutionally barred from seeking office again, but is backing
fellow Christian Democrat Fidel Chavez Mena, a former foreign
minister.
   Chavez faces Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist Republican
National Alliance Party, known by its Spanish acronym ARENA and
headed by controversial Roberto D'Abuisson.
   Polls have said the ARENA candidate is leading. That has caused
U.S. officials concern that an ARENA victory could further polarize
the war-torn country and make it more difficult to get further aid
to El Salvador through Congress.
   On Tuesday, Quayle visited Capitol Hill, where he told his old
congressional colleagues that his golf game is suffering as he
develops skills he needs in his new job.
   ``I used to give you strokes, but no more,'' Quayle told Rep. Bob
Michel, R-Ill., the House minority leader and another avid golfer.
   Michel introduced Quayle to the GOP leadership, and members
tossed around some jokes about what House Republicans want from the
new vice president: appearances at fund-raisers, friends appointed
to Bush administration jobs, and tickets to events.
   ``How are you at funerals?'' asked one, poking fun at the
assignment of vice presidents to attend funerals of foreign leaders.
   ``I think I'm going to be very good,'' Quayle replied.
   Quayle spent most of his day Tuesday with congressional leaders,
first at a bipartisan meeting with President Bush at the White House
and then posing for pictures with House and Senate Republicans and
Democrats in a series of courtesy calls.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Catholic Priests Consider Big Pay Hike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Catholic priests in Milwaukee feel they deserve
better pay and are studying a proposal that would give them
substantially higher salaries.
   The Archdiocesan Council of Priests adopted the recommendation to
set a salary range of $25,000 to $40,000 Monday, and parish councils
throughout the Milwaukee Catholic Archdiocese will be asked their
opinion.
   The council's recommendation was designed to put the salary for
priests on a par with those of Protestant clergy, military chaplains
and lay administrators.
   The plan to achieve parity in pay would be the first among
dioceses in the country, said Father Alan Jurkus, moderator of the
Council of Priests, although the issue has been the source of
considerable discussion among priests for some time.
   Diocesan priests are now paid $6,096 to $12,480 a year, in
addition to allowances. Each priest gets $209 a month car allowance,
and each parish counsel negotiates how much money will be allowed
for food. Parishes provide housing and some provide cooking and
cleaning services.
   The new proposal would end those allowances.
   If approved by the parish councils and Archbishop Rembert
Weakland, the proposal would take effect July 1, 1990, at the
earliest.
   As an interim measure, a proposal to increase priests' salaries
by $200 a month was approved by the council Monday and was sent to
Weakland for a decision.
   Weakland said the impact on the diocese and parishes of the
$200-a-month increase would have to be studied, but that he would
probably favor the move.
   The proposal for higher salaries and the change in living
expenses needs more study, Weakland said.
   ``I'm in sympathy with it,'' he said. ``It's much more equitable
to get a flat salary rather than having to bargain for it.''
   ``Some newly ordained priests carry debts of their education,''
Weakland added. ``For older priests, it's the security of the
future.''
   The National Federation of Priests' Councils did a comparative
study in the fall of 1983 on compensation for diocesan priests
around the country and will begin a new survey next month. Of the
180 dioceses that responded to the 1983 questionnaire, Milwaukee
priests ranked second-highest in compensation.

   Episcopal officials Tuesday approved the election
of the first woman bishop in the 2,000-year tradition of apostolic
succession, a line of bishops dating to Christ and his apostles.
   The approval of the election of Episcopal Bishop-elect Barbara
Harris brought a woman into that long line maintained by
Anglicanism, including the U.S. Episcopal Church, and Roman
Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Both the Catholic Church and
Eastern Orthodox churches bar women from the clergy.
   Her elevation as a suffragen, or assistant, bishop in the
denomination's Boston diocese sharply upset many conservatives
throughout the Episcopal Church but was hailed as progress by many
others.
   Her ``consecration will be both a momentous and solemn occasion
and a time of great joy and celebration,'' said the denomination's
top officer, Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning.
   His statement came after a majority of 60 of the church's 118
U.S. bishops gave their consent for her elevation, following
previous approval by a majority of the diocesan standing committees.
   The 60th vote was received by mail Tuesday afternoon, said the
Rev. James Solheim, spokesman for the Boston diocese. The approval
process, which began about three weeks ago after confirmation from a
majority of standing committees around the country, moved slower
than expected, Solheim said.
   Harris has declined to discuss her election until after it is
formally approved. She has an unlisted telephone number of because
of several threatening calls she received after the election.
   Harris had been elected Sept. 24 by a Massachusetts diocesan
convention.
   The election of Harris, 58, a divorced former public relations
executive, reverberated throughout world Anglicanism.
   Browning, in a statement from his office in New York, said most
of the churchwide consideration of Harris had been in a ``spirit of
prayerful discussion and sensitivity.'' But, he said, there also
were some ``angry words, some mean-spirited words and some
threatening words.''
   ``I have found this both inappropriate to the process and
diminishing to the sense of how we should conduct ourselves,'' he
said.
   The denomination approved women priests and bishops in 1976.
Since then, about 1,200 women have been ordained as priests in the
Episcopal Church.
   Critics said Harris was too liberal in her political views.
Others criticized her lack of college degree or seminary training,
while church conservatives said that under no circumstances would
they support any woman for bishop.
   Supporters said Harris was qualified for the job and her election
would broaden the scope of the church's outreach.
   Harris, who is black, was ordained a priest in Philadelphia in
1980 after studying theology through correspondence courses and with
tutors. In addition to her parish work, she recently headed the
Episcopal Church Publishing Co.
   Her election was termed as contributing to a ``final crisis for
the church'' in a pastoral letter from seven bishops of the
Evangelical and Catholic Mission, an Episcopal group that opposes
female priests and bishops.
   A compromise on the issue of female bishops was worked out in
July when the Episcopal Church's governing convention in Detroit
approved a measure allowing any congregation rejecting a woman
bishop to petition for a male ``Episcopal visitor'' bishop to
administer confirmations.
   But the woman bishop still would make periodic visits to such a
congregation, as required by church law.
   Harris' consecration ceremony is planned for Feb. 11.

<HEAD>New Group Renews Fight for No-Fault Car Insurance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No-fault auto insurance would save motorists
$3.7 billion nationwide, perhaps hundreds of dollars per family in
some states, a new consumer group estimated Tuesday in announcing a
campaign to convert all states to no-fault.
   ``Something must be done to break the 20-year cycle of madness
that has produced constant auto insurance crises,'' said Virginia
Knauer, leader of the organization, New Start.
   Ms. Knauer served presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan as special
assistant for consumer affairs.
   The group said it was still working on estimates for separate
states and could not say how much individual drivers would save. It
said its estimate of nationwide savings was based on 1987 data from
the states.
   Something close to true no-fault auto insurance, first proposed
in a 1965 book by Robert Keaton and Jeffrey O'Connell, has been
adopted only in Michigan, New York and Florida, the group said.
Eleven other states have variants which Ms. Knauer called ``phony
no-fault,'' and 12 more use elements of no-fault plans in
traditional insurance law.
   Skyrocketing premiums have become politically controversial in
several states. California voters last fall passed a referendum
requiring companies to reduce premiums 20 percent.
   Nationwide, auto insurance premiums increased 60 percent from
1982 to 1987 while the Consumer Price Index was increasing 17
percent, the group said.
   Under traditional insurance, people involved in accidents often
file lawsuits to determine who was at fault and whose insurance
company must pay.
   Critics say this overcompensates the slightly injured,
undercompensates the gravely hurt, clogs the courts with lawsuits
that take years to reach verdicts and, according to a 1985
Transportation Department study, returns to victims only half of
premium payments. The rest goes to lawyers and to people who
administer the system.
   New Start said studies showed Michigan victims get 73 cents of
every premium dollar and New York victims get 60 cents.
   Bill Wagner of Tampa, Fla., president of the Association of
American Trial Lawyers, said of the new group and its contentions,
``If this entity could come up with a way to ensure fair treatment
to injured people by depriving them of their right to court, I'd be
for it.''
   Under no-fault, victims rapidly see ``the economic power of the
insurance companies used to deprive them of all their rights,'' he
said.
   In a no-fault system, victims file claims against their own
companies and are compensated by them regardless of who is at fault.
All 14 no-fault states restrict the right to sue.
   Michigan, New York and Florida limit lawsuits to people who have
suffered ``serious and permanent'' injury. This restriction greatly
reduces the number of suits, the group said.
   The other 11 states set a dollar threshold, ranging up to $6,000.
People who suffer losses greater than that may sue.
   The states: Colorado $500, Connecticut $400, Georgia $500, Hawaii
$6,000, Kansas $2,000, Kentucky $1,000, Massachusetts $500,
Minnesota $4,000, New Jersey $1,700, North Dakota $2,500 and Utah
$3,000.
   ``Monetary thresholds have proven ineffective because they
encourage abuses _ excessive medical treatment, inflated bills and,
in some cases, outright fraud _ to reach the required dollar
amount,'' New Start said.
   Ms. Knauer said she would invite heads of insurance companies to
meet with her next month before she begins a cross-country tour to
drum up support.
   ``I think the experience of the past 20 years suggests that
little can be accomplished which benefits the consumer by drawing a
line, and standing there shouting across the divide at insurance
companies,'' she said. ``They clearly are part of the problem, but
if we are to get anywhere, they equally clearly must be part of the
solution.''
   James L. Brown, director of the Center for Consumer Affairs at
the University of Wisconsin and one of the two founders of New Start
with the Rev. Robert J. McEwen, professor of economics at Boston
College, said no insurance industry funds had gone into organizing
the new group.

   Authorities on Tuesday released the last of three
African students arrested after a Dec. 24 campus brawl that
triggered anti-African protests in several cities.
   The action comes one day before Mali President Moussa Traore, who
also is executive president of the Organization of African Unity,
arrives in China for a state visit. The OAU had criticized China's
handling of the racially tinged fight and later protests.
   Alex Dosoo of Ghana said in a telephone interview from the
eastern city of Nanking that he was released Tuesday from a guest
house where he was held in a guarded room for the last 11 days of
his 25-day captivity. The first two weeks he spent in jail.
   Dosoo said authorities still maintain he seriously injured a
Chinese man in the Dec. 24 fight at Nanking's Hehai University. He
denies the charge.
   He said police told him he was being freed ``because I have been
of good conduct ... and mostly in the interests of relations between
African countries and China.''
   Dosoo, a second-year engineering student, said he was told he can
continue his studies, but that he wants to return home.
   Ghana had protested Dosoo's arrest and said it might pull out its
26 students in China. Officials at its embassy in Beijing could not
immediately be reached Tuesday night for comment on Dosoo's release.
   Alpha Robinson of Gambia and Dossoumou Boni Lodovic of Benin were
held in disciplinary detention for two weeks on charges of ``trying
to stir up trouble'' during the fight. China initially ordered them
to leave China but later reversed itself. Robinson left and
officials have been trying to persuade Lodovic to stay.
   The reversal of the expulsions and Dosoo's release appeared
intended to soothe any ill will with African countries, whom China
long has courted in pursuit of Third World solidarity.
   Many African embassies also have seemed unwilling to criticize
China openly over the events, even while privately complaining about
China's handling of them.
   Traore's visit, his third to China since 1973, was planned before
the Nanking clash.
   According to Chinese officials, the Dec. 24 fight began when
African students at the Hehai campus gate refused to register
Chinese girlfriends they were bringing to a school dance. China says
the Africans attacked school guards and Chinese students, and that
11 Chinese and two Africans were hurt.
   However, African students say Chinese students attacked the
Africans first.
   Dosoo said Chinese hit him with umbrellas and he kicked one in
self-defense. He said after fleeing the area that he and a friend
were attacked by more than two dozen Chinese, and that one hit him
in the head, causing a wound that required stitches.
   Hundreds of Chinese students stoned the Africans' dormitories.
Throughout the week, thousands of Chinese marched through Nanking
shouting ``Kill the black devils!''
   Smaller confrontations involving alleged racism against African
students occurred in Beijing and two other cities, and nearly 500
Africans at one Beijing school have been boycotting classes since
Jan. 4 in protest.
   Eric Akumiah of Ghana, president of the Nanking branch of the
General Union of African Students in China, said about half of the
approximately 140 Africans studying in the city have returned to
classes in the past two weeks at their embassies' orders.
   He said only about 40 remain determined to leave China, including
himself.
   ``The Chinese are trying to ... just cover it up, be cool. That
is not the ultimate solution,'' he said. ``Today it's Nanking. Maybe
it will calm down. But it will come up again soon.
   ``The problem is the Chinese are unwilling to accept that there
is any trace of racism in China, and if you don't identify your
problem you can't solve it.''
   About 1,500 Africans are studying in China, many on scholarships
from Chinese government. Many report taunting from Chinese about
their dark skin. Several smaller clashes have occurred between
African and Chinese students in recent years, but Chinese officials
deny any racial element.
   Akumiah said the union had planned to send a student delegation
to meet Traore but authorities were not allowing African students to
board trains without passes from their schools.

   The USS John F. Kennedy, the aircraft carrier
involved in a confrontation with Libyan jets earlier this month, has
left the Mediterranean Sea and is steaming home, the Pentagon said
Tuesday.
   The Kennedy has been replaced by a battle group led by the
carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, added Fred Hoffman, a Pentagon
spokesman.
   ``The Roosevelt is there and the Kennedy is out,'' Hoffman said
at a briefing.
   Navy officials said the Kennedy is expected to arrive home at
Norfolk, Va., Feb. 2.
   The departure of the Kennedy and its battle group means the
United States no longer has two aircraft carriers in the region. The
presence of two carriers earlier this month fueled speculation the
United States might be contemplating a bombing raid on a suspected
chemical weapons plant inside Libya.
   Navy and Pentagon officials insisted all along, however, the two
carriers were simply in the midst of a routine overlap as one
relieved the other.
   On Jan. 4, two F-14 Tomcat jet fighters from the Kennedy shot
down two Libyan MiG-23 fighters after being approached ``in a
hostile manner'' while on a routine patrol protecting the carrier,
according to the Pentagon.

   The U.S. government on Tuesday hailed East
Germany's proposed cuts in military spending and troop strength,
saying such moves could provide good momentum for upcoming
negotiations on reducing conventional military forces in Europe.
   ``We welcome the announcement of the proposed cuts ... especially
if they are implemented in such a way that both GDR (German
Democratic Republic) and Warsaw Pact forces begin to become
defensive in their structure and doctrine,'' State Department
spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.
   Erich Honnecker, leader of the Warsaw Pact nation, announced on
Monday that his country would reduce its armed forces by 10,000 and
cut military spending by 10 percent.
   This follows Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's announcement
last month before the United Nations General Assembly that he
planned to slash Soviet forces in Eastern Europe by 50,000 men and
5,000 tanks.
   ``The Soviet and East German unilateral reductions, if
implemented, could give good momentum to the new conventional
talks,'' Redman said.
   Redman argued that Honnecker's announcement amounted to ``the
acknowledgement of the existence of Warsaw Pact conventional
superiority in Europe.''
   Saying the United States has often pressed for asymmetrical
reductions to eliminate the East-bloc superiority in troops and
tanks, Redman added that ``we thus doubly welcome the GDR's
announcement as confirmation that our approach to conventional arms
control in Europe is the proper one.''
   The spokesman said the administration looks forward to beginning
the conventional arms talks, set to start in March in Vienna.

<HEAD>Soviets Buy U.S. Wheat, Nearly Exhausting Purchase Authority</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
635,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, virtually
wiping out its current purchase authority, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   Christopher E. Goldthwait, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part
of 2 million tons authorized Dec. 23 under the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   The wheat was bought under a long-term supply agreement.
   Goldthwait said the wheat is for shipment in February and March.
Counting some wheat left over from previous arrangements, the
Soviets have only 35,200 tons still available under the program.
   With the latest sales, the Soviets have bought about 1.65 million
tons of U.S. wheat for delivery in the sixth year of the pact. The
agreement expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended through Dec.
31, 1990.
   The arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Last year, U.S. corn sales to the Soviet Union totaled slightly
less than 5.2 million tons. Wheat sales in 1987-88, all subsidized,
totaled slightly more than 9 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 635,000 tons of
wheat would be about 23.3 million bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging more than $4 per
bushel, according to recent USDA market figures, making the new sale
worth an estimated $93 million.
   Besides the wheat for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the
Soviets have ordered 10.2 million tons of corn, 450,000 tons of
soybeans, and 1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of
grain sorghum. Only the wheat is subsidized.
   Goldthwait said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy
rate of $23.05 per ton, or about 63 cents per bushel. He said the
bonuses on the 635,000 tons of wheat will be paid to seven
companies: Cargill Inc., 75,000 tons; Continental Grain Co.,
100,000; Garnac Grain Co., 25,000; Ferruzzi U.S.A. Inc., 300,000;
Toepfer International, 50,000; Union Equity Cooperative Exchange,
50,000, and Louis Dreyfus Corp., 35,000.

   Afghanistan's official radio claimed
Tuesday that government forces killed 711 Moslem guerrillas in the
previous 24 hours, 377 of them along the Salang Highway between the
capital and the Soviet border.
   No confirmation was available. Western observers usually describe
the radio's casualty claims as exaggerated.
   Kabul radio also said guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Masoud,
called ``Lion of the Panjshir'' by his men, had looted 517 trucks
and burned 89 in the past nine months. It accused him of banditry.
   The Salang Highway runs through the Panjshir Valley. Severe food
and fuel shortages have resulted from insurgent attacks on convoys
along the highway, which carries departing Soviet soldiers home and
supplies to Kabul, the capital.
   Under a U.N.-mediated agreement, the Soviet military withdrawal
from Afghanistan is to be completed by Feb. 15.

   Security remains tight at the sorority
house where Ted Bundy killed two women 11 years ago, but current
residents were little troubled by his execution, an adviser said
Tuesday.
   ``They hope that they will be allowed to put this behind them,''
Kirk B. Cocke said.
   Security measures were evident as Mrs. Cocke, a former president
of Chi Omega National as well as a former adviser to the Florida
State University chapter, dealt with reporters Tuesday after Bundy's
morning execution.
   Once she stepped out of the house to talk with journalists, she
couldn't get back in without ringing the bell. And she couldn't
leave the door open without setting off a burglar alarm.
   The current sorority sisters were in grammar school when Margaret
Bowman, 21, and Lisa Levy, 20, were bludgeoned to death by Bundy on
Jan. 15, 1978. Two other students also were attacked but survived.
   ``So they really don't know anything about it except, of course,
they're conscious of all the attention,'' Mrs. Cocke said.
   Bundy was executed for the February 1978 death of 12-year-old
Kimberly Leach of Lake City, his last victim. But he also was
sentenced to death in the sorority house killings.
   ``I simply had breakfast with them this morning and talked to
them and answered their questions,'' Mrs. Cocke said.
   ``They're taking this with a great deal of calmness and poise and
dignity, I think.''
   Of Bundy's execution, she said: ``There was no feeling of
jubilation on part of the girls. It was more sadness and relief than
anything.''
   She said she didn't believe the current sorority sisters think
too much about Bundy's ramage.
   ``There are memorials in the house for the two girls that were
killed, and every year there's an award given in memory of the two
girls who were killed to the most outstanding Chi Omega,'' she said.
``But other than that they really don't think about it one way or
the other.''
   However, the last week, since Gov. Bob Martinez signed Bundy's
fourth death warrant Jan. 17, has been tense, according to Mrs.
Cocke.
   ``I think the attention it has created has made it worse on the
girls,'' she said, adding that it's difficult for them to answer the
many questions about how they feel and what they think of the case.
   Mrs. Cocke, who taught business management at Florida State
University at the time of the murders, knew both of the victims and
was one of the many adults who helped the sorority sisters after the
attack.
   ``It was a terribly traumatic time, terribly traumatic. Of
course, it was about six weeks or two months before he was caught so
that was a time of great tension. But even then the girls took it
with a great deal of dignity and grace. And they faced death for the
first time in their young lives.''

<TEXT>
   The United States and Britain on Tuesday asked
for a 33-nation meeting of transportation officials to plan
anti-terrorism measures following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103
over Scotland last month.
   The meeting, proposed for Montreal next month, would seek to
improve international standards for handling passengers, baggage and
cargo to prevent sabotage, said Mimi Weyforth Dawson, acting
transportation secretary.
   Samuel Skinner, whose Senate confirmation hearings as
transportation secretary open Wednesday, would attend if confirmed,
Dawson said.
   She and British Secretary of State for Transportation Paul
Channon made the joint request for a special session of the Council
of the International Civil Aviation Organization to include
transportation ministers or secretaries from the 33 countries that
sit on the council. The Montreal-based organization has 160 member
nations.
   Charles Lafond, spokesman for the ICAO, which is a United Nations
agency, said the council was in session currently and had an
``unlawful interference'' committee that was expected to take up
issues surrounding Flight 103. He said council officials had not
received the U.S.-British request, and no special meeting was yet
scheduled.
   Investigators of the Dec. 21 explosion which killed all 259
people aboard the Pan American Boeing 747 and 11 on the ground
concluded the plane was destroyed in flight by an explosive device,
probably made of plastique.
   Authorities have identified a baggage container in the 747's
forward cargo hold which they believe contained the bomb. But they
have not suggested how, by whom or at what point the bomb was
smuggled aboard the airliner.
   The plane was on the London-New York leg of a flight that
originated in Frankfurt. The Times of London reported last week that
investigators think the luggage was first loaded in Frankfurt and
transferred tothe 747 at London's Heathrow airport.
   Another British newspaper, The Sunday Express, reported Jan. 15
that investigators were looking into the theory that the bomb went
aboard the plane with a soldier involved in a diamond smuggling ring.
   During the weekend, Syria's defense minister, Mustafa Tlass,
alleged that Israeli intelligence agents duped an American soldier
into carrying the bomb in his luggage, paying him $300,000 and
telling him it was diamonds to be smuggled into the United States.
   Israel, which accuses Palestinian elements of planting the bomb,
called the charge ``ridiculous and malicious.''
   A U.S. Transportation Department announcement said Dawson and
Channon called for the high-level session to ``emphasize the
worldwide nature of the terrorist threat, and the need for greater
international cooperation and improved security measures.''
   Dawson said the meeting would consider how standard security
measures might be expanded and applied uniformly in high-risk areas.
She also said it would explore ways of increasing research and
development of explosive detection, aircraft design and construction
and security equipment.
   The announcement said the international organization would look
for ways to assist countries trying to improve aviation security
measures and possibly survey airports, upon request, to see if they
meet international safety standards.

   A powerful aftershock was reported Tuesday in
northwestern Armenia, where an earthquake killed 25,000 people last
month, but an official said people had been warned and no casualties
were reported.
   Ruben Karagyosyan of the official earthquake relief commission
for Armenia said 10 aftershocks were recorded Monday night and
Tuesday morning, including one at 5:30 a.m. that registered 5.4 on
the Richter scale.
   The official news agency Tass said the epicenter was northwest of
Kirovakan, a city heavily damaged by the Dec. 7 quake.
   In a telephone interview from Yerevan, capital of Armenia,
Karagyosyan said: ``Our scientists had already warned the government
and the population over television and through the press that
aftershocks in the zone of the quake were predicted.''
   People had been told not to congregate in kindergartens, schools
and other buildings, he said, ``so there were no serious
consequences.''
   He said strong aftershocks also occurred Dec. 31 and Jan. 4.

<HEAD>Petition Asks Broadening of Ford Pickup Fires Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The private Center for Auto Safety asked the
government Tuesday to order the recall of 1.9 million Ford Motor Co.
pickup trucks, alleging that the vehicles' fuel system tends to
catch fire.
   The petition, by an advocacy group often at odds with the
automakers and their regulators, asked the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration to broaden its probe of alleged fires in
Ford's F-series pickup trucks with dual gas tanks.
   The agency in December opened a low-level investigation of Ford
F-series pickups made from 1986 through 1988. The center asked that
the investigation include pickups made as far back as 1983 and be
raised to an engineering analysis, a higher level than the present
preliminary evaluation.
   ``Opening the lowest-level investigation is woefully
inadequate,'' the petition said.
   The center said it had received eight reports of fires involving
F-series pickups.
   A Ford spokeswoman, Joyce Stinson, said at the company's
Dearborn, Mich., headquarters that Ford was cooperating with the
investigation and if it were broadened, ``we would continue to do
so.''
   The government agency, as a matter of policy, refuses to comment
on investigations in progress. It responds to petitions within 120
days of their filing.
   The petition was the second filed by the center this week after
months of little public activity.
   The center's director, Clarence Ditlow, said the organization had
deliberately held off from filing petitions until the new Bush
administration took office.
   ``Our experience here in Washington is any time there is an
election, from just before the election to when the new
administration comes in, nothing gets done,'' Ditlow said.

   The federal mediator in the 15-month dispute

to Washington because talks last week failed to achieve a settlement
on major issues, the chairman of the National Mediation Board said
Tuesday.
   Chairman Walter C. Wallace said talks between Miami-based Eastern
and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers union resulted in some progress on minor issues but no
agreements on major issues. Wallace, in a statement issued by his
Washington office, was not more specific.
   As a result, mediator Harry Bickford was recalled to Washington
and the talks recessed until the mediation board conducts a status
review, Wallace said.
   He said the board had requested that both the airline and the
union refrain from making public statements about the talks pending
further announcements from the board.
   Eastern, which estimates it is losing $1 million a day, is
seeking $150 million in wage concessions from the 8,500-member union.

<HEAD>Bush Promises His Own Budget, in Effect, Next Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush pledged Tuesday to submit
detailed revisions to Ronald Reagan's budget next month and
suggested high-level negotiations between the White House and
Congress to produce an early agreement.
   The White House acknowledged Bush had not kept his promise to
send his team of budget negotiators to Congress on the first day of
his presidency. Likewise, it appeared unlikely Bush would follow
through on his promise to personally lead the budget talks.
   Amid a glow of bipartisan good will on the fourth day of his
presidency, Bush met at the White House with Democratic and
Republican congressional leaders to seek cooperation on the budget
and foreign policy.
   ``Generally there is a very hopeful sense that we are going to be
able to find bipartisanship almost everywhere,'' the speaker of the
House, Rep. Jim Wright, D-Texas, said after two hours of talks with
Bush.
   ``It was all sweetness and light,'' said the House Republican
whip, Rep. Richard Cheney of Wyoming, acknowledging that differences
on the budget and other problems are inevitable eventually. ``The
honeymoon's still on _ two more days, three more days _ enjoy it
while it lasts.''
   Republicans and Democrats alike said Bush gave no clue about his
budget priorities, but said his proposals would include steps to
deal with the nation's savings and loan crisis.
   Bush will address a joint session of Congress on Feb. 9 to reveal
proposals for revising Reagan's $1.15 trillion budget for fiscal
1990.
   Wright and other Democratic leaders reserved judgment on Bush's
formula for budget talks. ``We'd like to wait until we see a budget,
until we see where the areas of agreement and disagreement would be,
before we consult,'' Wright said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration suggested that Congress, in a break with tradition,
try to speed up work on the budget by holding weekly meetings
attended by top House and Senate leaders, as well as the chairmen of
various committees with jurisdiction over the budget and tax-writing
legislation.
   Fitzwater said Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady
would join the talks. ``I don't think the president would be
involved on a continuing basis but he probably could be involved at
any point,'' the spokesman said.
   Of the plan for weekly meetings, the House Republican leader,
Rep. Robert Michel of Illinois, told reporters:
   ``It would be to our advantage to have the leadership meet in an
informal sort of way from time to time, moving the process along,
(so) that it doesn't get to lag and drag,''
   He said the goal would be ``to telescope the process'' and said
Wright had promised Bush his budget would be on ``a fast track.''
   Wright presented Bush with a bottle of hot pepper sauce and a jar
of pork rinds _ his favorite snack _ at the outset of the White
House meeting. ``We want to give a very warm welcome to the
president,'' Wright joked.
   Emerging from the talks, the congressional leaders gave Bush high
praise for making his first formal contact with Congress a
bipartisan one.
   ``It was a cordial meeting. There is (a) good atmosphere,'' said
the Senate Democratic leader, George Mitchell of Maine.
   Bush promised the leaders he would submit a major rewrite of
Reagan's budget, not just minor modifications.
   ``The president agreed to submit a full and concise budget by
mid-February,'' Wright said.
   Mitchell said, ``I don't think we anticipate a complete budget
proposal of the depth and detail that President Reagan submitted.
   ``But we do expect a budget proposal of sufficient detail to make
clear what the president's priorities are and how he plans to deal
with the serious problems facing the country.''
   ``I hope the sweetness and light will last a long time,'' said
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the assistant Senate majority leader.
   ``It's clear the president is a man interested in achieving
honest accommodation whenever he could'' and ``go the extra
distance'' to reach compromises with Congress' Democratic majority,
Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., told reporters.
   Bush did talk about wanting to meet separately with congressional
banking leaders to discuss the nation's savings and loan crisis.
   Democrats said they still expected major arguments with the
president, particularly over Central America and budget policy.
``There have always been differences between Congresses and
presidents. That's the nature of the system,'' Cranston said.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. appeared Tuesday for the
second time before a federal grand jury investigating his ties to a
drug suspect, but his attorney stressed again that Barry isn't a
target of the probe.
   ``During the time that the mayor was at the grand jury, we were
completely unafraid of anything concerning the Ramada Inn
investigation or the Virgin Islands investigation,'' said R. Kenneth
Mundy, Barry's attorney.
   ``I'm stronger than ever before,'' Barry said after his
two-and-one-half hour appearance. When asked if he was a target of
the investigation, he responded, ``absolutely not.''
   Federal officials refused comment on Barry's appearances, but
have said before they are trying to determine if the mayor thwarted
a police drug probe in late December. The grand jury is also
examining the mayor's role in a joint personnel project involving
the city and Virgin Islands government.
   Police were called back from a Dec. 22 attempt to buy drugs from
the suspect, Charles Lewis, after Barry turned up in Lewis' room at
a dowtown Ramada Inn. Barry has since acknowledged making several
calls to police investigating the incident, but said he was only
trying to speed up their inquiry.
   Lewis also headed the $260,000 joint personnel project for the
Virgin Islands government, but was fired from his post last April
after Virgin Islands officials became concerned about cost overruns.
Barry and other top city aids ran up hotel bills in the Virgin
islands of more than $37,000 while working on the plan.
   Mundy said Barry is unlikely to be called before the panel again,
but the mayor was served with a subpoeana that requested all of his
telephone records, schedules, and daily diaries for December, which
covers the time period when Lewis was in the Washington area. The
grand jury is also seeking all phone messages dating back to Sept.
15.
   All the requested material will be turned over to the grand jury
as soon as possible, Mundy said.

<HEAD>New Restrictions on Sewage Sludge Contaminants Proposed by EPA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency proposed
new restrictions Tuesday on contaminants in sewage sludge.
   When finally issued, the restrictions will affect about one-third
of the nation's sewage-treatment plants.
   ``This proposal will help lower the contaminant level of sludge
and make it easier for local communities to market it
successfully,'' said acting EPA Administrator John Moore.
   Sludge is the residue removed from sewage during waste-water
treatment and normally contains organic material that can be sold as
agricultural or home-garden fertilizer for as much as $60 a ton.
But, according to the EPA, it also contains metals and toxic
pollutants that must be controlled.
   Moore said the purpose of the proposed regulations, which will
set standards on the level of contamination covering 28 organic and
metallic pollutants found in sludge, is to reduce the level of
contaminants in the waste byproduct.
   Among pollutants covered by the proposed rule are arsenic, lead,
PCBs, zinc, mercury, and benzene.
   The EPA said that the new rules establish maximum levels of the
various pollutants that will be allowed in the sludge and still meet
federal requirements.
   It added that agency risk analysis indicates that ``improper
disposal of contaminanted sludge could present health dangers,
including possibly cancer and hypertension in middle-aged men.''
   The proposed rules apply to about 5,300 treatment plants which
account for about half of all the sewage sludge processed. Most of
the remaining 10,000 plants either are covered by other regulations
because they use municipal solid waste landfills, or present
``minimal or no threat to public health'' because of the way they
are disposed.
   The EPA estimated the cost of the regulatory requirement at $157
million a year, most of it associated with the increased use of
incinerators to deal with the pollutants.
   The agency estimated that in the long run the additional
precautions could prevent 5,200 from being stricken by cancer or
have other health problems.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president's party on Tuesday
rejected a new offer by leftist guerrillas to participate in
elections if voting is postponed for six months.
   Fidel Chavez Mena, the Christian Democratic presidential
candidate and a close adviser to President Jose Napoleon Duarte,
said ``great efforts must be made on behalf of peace'' but that
putting off elections beyond March 31 would be unconstitutional.
   The constitution says elections must be held at least two months
before a new government is due to take office. Duarte's term ends
June 1.
   Roberto Viera, minister of communications, said the government
will analyze the document point by point and present a detailed,
formal response.
   The Marxist-led guerrillas, in a document made public Tuesday,
said they would take part if a presidential vote scheduled for March
19 is postponed to Sept. 15. They set other conditions, including
confinement of the army to barracks on election day.
   ``Many have said that the only obstacle to peace in El Salvador
is that we demanded a share of power before elections,'' said
Salvador Samoyoa, a member of the political commission of the
Farabundo Marti Liberation Front guerrillas, known as FMLN.
   ``Now we have removed that obstacle,'' Samoyoa said Tuesday at a
Mexico City news conference. ``We have agreed to play the game on
their field.''
   The guerrillas presented the proposal as a test of the other
political parties' desire for peace and of President Bush's desire
for political solutions in Central America.
   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a member of the guerrillas' general
command, said the proposal was made because of increasing violence
and deteriorating economic, social and political conditions.
   ``The nation is headed for a social explosion,'' she said. When
asked what the guerrilla reaction would be if the proposal failed,
Ms. Martinez said, ``The tendency towards violence is increasing,
and the FMLN is not on the margins of that reality.''
   The guerrillas said Tuesday they would throw their support behind
Guillermo Ungo, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Convergence
alliance, if te vote were switched to Sept. 15. ``We believe we can
win if a fair election is held,'' said Ms. Martinez.
   The group's 7,000 guerrillas have been fighting the U.S.-backed
government and its 56,000-strong army for nine years, but neither
side has been able to gain a decisive advantage.
   The right-wing Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, which
has been leading in polls for the presidential election, noted that
the guerrillas did not say they would stop fighting.
   ``We are willing to talk. What we cannot do is subordinate
ourselves to a group of terrorist delinquents,'' said Sigifredo
Ochoa, a top Arena leader in the National Assembly.
   The Christian Democrats control the executive branch, but Arena
trounced the centrist party in legislative and mayoral elections
last year.
   The Arena presidential candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, led Mena by
more than 10 percentage points in a December poll, with Ungo running
a distant third.
   A diplomat in close contact with the army high command said the
response from Defense Minister Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova to the
guerrilla proposal was ``a flat-out `no.'''
   A Western diplomat the only way the armed forces could be
persuaded to accept the proposal would be through strong pressure
from the United States.
   ``This is a proposal for the U.S. Congress as much as it is for
the Salvadorans,'' the diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
   Washington has provided El Salvador more than $3 billion in aid
since 1980, more than it has given any other country in the Western
Hemisphere.
   Another diplomat said the insurgents might be counting on
rejection. They could then portray themselves as a party truly
interested in peace but obliged to continue fighting.
   Ruben Zamora, a leader of the Democratic Convergence, called the
proposal ``a test to see if Salvadoran politicians really want peace
or if they only want jobs on the public payroll.''
   The guerrilla's conditions include a halt to ``repression'' of
labor and peasant leaders, revising the electoral code, awarding a
seat on the Central Elections Council to the Democratic Convergence,
and non-interference by the United States.
   In return, the guerrillas said they would respect political
activity, halt assassinations of mayors, observe a five-day truce at
election time, and call for participation by their ``entire social
base.'' The guerrillas have boycotted previous elections as a
``farce.''

   The Pentagon bowed to Congress Tuesday and
authorized the Special Operations Command to develop its own budget
and program proposals, providing America's commando warriors some
independence from the bureaucracies of the parent services.
   The decision was made by William H. Taft IV, currently the acting
secretary of defense while Secretary-designate John Tower awaits
Senate confirmation.
   Defense sources who insisted on anonymity said Taft acted after
Tower made it clear ``he didn't want this becoming an issue at his
confirmation hearing.''
   On the surface, Tuesday's move would appear to involve merely a
change in internal bureaucratic procedures.
   But defense sources and congressional leaders described the
change as important Tuesday, explaining that for the first time the
general in charge of Special Operations Forces would have a direct
line to the secretary of defense instead of having to funnel his
budget requests through the Navy, Air Force and Army.
   ``I'm very happy and pleased that Secretary Taft has directed
this,'' said Rep. Earl Hutto, D-Fla., the chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee's Special Operations Panel, adding he was
informed of the move Tuesday.
   ``The armed services have not done right by special operations.
It's been a low priority for them. And there's no question there has
been a lot of resistance over there (inside the Pentagon).
   ``But we have to get the Special Operations Forces the resources
they need, and the only way to do that is to give them budget
authority.''
   The Special Operations Command was ordered established by
Congress in legislation that was approved in October 1986. That bill
specified the new command should receive its own budgeting
authority, but set no deadline.
   The Pentagon has subsequently come under fire the past two years
for its slow pace in reorganizing the chain-of-command and setting
up the new entity.
   The Reagan administration consistently argued it was making great
strides in improving the readiness of the Navy's SEAL's; the Army's
Rangers, Green Berets and anti-terrorist Delta Team, and the Air
Force's First Special Operations Wing.
   But Congress remained unconvinced, saying it still appeared the
elite commando units were losing out in the internal Pentagon
battles for manpower and money and didn't have the training or
equipment to work together.
   Taft's directive specifies the commander-in-chief of the Special
Operations Command, or CINCSOC, will be assigned ``program-budget
development responsibilities for Special Operations Forces.''
   ``I direct all (officials) to provide the U.S. Special Operations
Command the resources, support, information and assistance required
to perform the above tasks,'' he added.
   The Special Operations Command, headquartered at MacDill Air
Force Base in Florida, is headed by Army Gen. James J. Lindsay.

<HEAD>Kirkland Offers No Comment On Dukakis Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland offered a quick
``no comment'' Tuesday when asked if Democrat Michael Dukakis waged
the type of campaign necessary to win the presidential election and
an equally quick ``no'' when asked if he would urge Dukakis to run
again.
   ``No, I wouldn't urge anyone; that's his decision,'' Kirkland
told a small group of reporters in his office. ``I have no intention
of promoting his candidacy four years ahead of time.''
   The initial question came after Kirkland, whose organization
endorsed the Massachusetts governor in the 1988 presidential race,
said he believed ``a good, fighting candidate with a good, fighting
campaign'' could win the presidency, regardless of party affiliation.
   Asked if Dukakis met that criteria, Kirkland smiled and said ``no
comment.''
   Dukakis recently announced he would not seek a fourth term as
governor. He said the announcment had nothing to do with plans for
another presidential campaign but others have speculated he is
considering seeking a rematch with President Bush in 1992.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Group Seeks More Taxes, Less Industry Money to Close Bankrupt
S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The savings and loan industry's largest trade
group on Tuesday recommended tapping the U.S. Treasury to close
insolvent institutions while slashing the amount contributed by
healthy S&amp;Ls.
   The proposal by the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, if
adopted, would have the effect of shifting all of the burden for
solving the problems of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
onto taxpayers and freeing the industry from further responsibility.
   The group, which plans to present its proposal Thursday at a
hearing of the House Budget Committee, wants to create a Resolution
Corporation as a new, independent federal agency.
   The Resolution Corporation would be responsible for liquidating
or selling the more than 350 insolvent, but still open, S&amp;Ls as well
as any institutions that lapse into insolvency in the next three
years.
   It also would take over all of the obligations the FSLIC has
acquired in rescuing institutions in the past. For instance, the
FSLIC ``resolved'' the cases of 205 insolvent institutions last
year, largely by issuing promissory notes and guarantees against
loss. These obligations would be transferred to the Resolution
Corporation.
   The Resolution Corporation would raise money by issuing notes,
which would be guaranteed by the Treasury. Any money the Resolution
Corporation gets from selling failed S&amp;Ls to new investors or from
selling the assets would go toward paying off the notes. However,
the Treasury would have to pay most of the bill.
   In the meantime, a new, industry-funded FSLIC would be created to
insure the deposits of healthy S&amp;Ls, which would pay an insurance
premium no higher than the premiums paid by commercial banks to
their fund, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Banks currently pay 8 cents per $100 in deposits. Since 1985,
S&amp;Ls have been paying a higher fee, 21 cents per $100 in deposits.
   Barney R. Beeksma, chairman of the U.S. League, argued that S&amp;Ls
already have paid $5 billion in extra assessments and can't afford
to pay more if they are to build their capital, a key reform
advocated by the League and private analysts.
   Capital represents the amount of money put up by an institution's
owners as backing for public deposits. The more capital there is,
the greater the cushion against failure and the more incentive the
owners have to operate the S&amp;L safely.
   ``We've paid all that we can pay and what we're concerned with
now is creating a viable insurance fund for the future,'' Beeksma
said in a telephone interview. ``Somebody has to decide whether they
want us to pay the bill for the FSLIC or build our capital to make
sure this doesn't happen again. We can't do both.''
   He said tapping taxpayer's funds ``is a price for the mistakes
that were made in the past by the Congress, the regulators and the
few in our business that shouldn't have been let in.''
   The trade group also is recommending that both the Resolution
Corporation and the new FSLIC should be independent of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, the regulator of the nation's 3,000 federally
insured S&amp;Ls. It said the current system of consolidated S&amp;L
regulation has not provided the necessary checks and balances.
   The league rejected, for now, proposals to merge the insurance
funds for S&amp;Ls and commercial banks. Beeksma said the issue should
be ``re-visited'' by Congress in three years, ``after the furor
subsides.''
   Meanwhile, the Treasury Department is finishing its own
recommendations to President Bush. It hasn't disclosed the plan, but
it has said a key principal of its recommendation will be that
further industry resources and additional insurance premiums should
be tapped before public funds.
   Bush, in a meeting Tuesday with congressional leaders, said he
would propose substantial revisions next month to Ronald Reagan's
budget, including measures to deal with the savings and loan crisis.
   In another development, Rep. Bob Michel of Illinois, the House
Republican leader, announced the creation of a GOP task force to
recommend solutions to the S&amp;L crisis. It will be chaired by Rep.
Stan Parris, R-Va., a member of the House Banking Committee.

   Two gunmen killed the attorney for
an accused drug trafficker whose extradition to the United States
last year sparked riots and a state of emergency, police said
Tuesday.
   Carlos Diaz Lorenzana, 54, was slain as he entered his home at
10:10 p.m. Monday in the Modelo district of Tegucigalpa, the
capital, police said.
   Lorenzana represented Juan Ramon Matta, a reputed drug baron who
is in federal prison in the United States on drug trafficking
charges.
   Police discovered 20 .38-caliber and 9 mm bullets in Lorenzana's
body, forensic expert Carlos Paz said.
   Authorities said they had no suspects and knew of no motives but
said an investigation was under way.
   Lorenzana acquired notoriety in 1987 after he successfully
defended Matta against drug charges during a year-long trial in a
Honduran court.
   Matta, a Honduran citizen, lived in Tegucigalpa and became a
popular figure for dispensing gifts to the poor.
   His removal to the United States in April caused violent protests
and forced the government to impose a state of emergency in
Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, 125 miles to the north.
   About 2,000 demonstrators burned the U.S. Consulate and the U.S.
Information Service office in the capital. Five Hondurans died in
the rioting.
   The Honduran Constitution forbids the extradition of Honduran
citizens.
   Matta is under indictment in three narcotics cases in California
and one in Arizona. He is in the federal maximum security prison in
Marion, Ill.
   In November in Marion, Matta was sentenced to three years for
escaping from prison in Florida in 1971.
   He also was wanted by U.S. authorities for questioning in the
1985 torture-slaying of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent
Enrique Camarena Salazar in Mexico, but he is not charged in that
case.
   Lorenzana is survived by his wife, Soledad Osejo, and a daughter,
Maria, who lives in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Reputed Crime Boss Gotti Freed on Bail</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Gotti, the reputed boss of the nation's most
powerful crime family, was freed on $100,000 bail Tuesday, less than
24 hours after an army of police arrested him.
   Mobbed by reporters and camera crews, a smiling Gotti emerged
from the courthouse about 1:30 p.m. and climbed into the back of a
waiting Lincoln. Earlier, the alleged leader of the Gambino crime
organization pleaded innocent to charges he had orchestrated the
shooting of a carpenter's union official.
   At a morning news conference Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau released a grand jury indictment charging that Gotti and
two associates had conspired to order the revenge shooting of the
union leader, who allegedly had a Manhattan restaurant vandalized
for using non-union carpenters.
   ``It was the specific goal and intention of the conspiracy to
punish John F. O'Connor, and thereby reaffirm the authority of the
Gambino crime family over all others who might challenge it,''
according to the indictment, which charges Gotti and two associates
with conspiracy and first-degree assault.
   O'Connor, vice president and business manager of Local 608 of the
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, survived the May 1986
attack, in which he was shot four times.
   O'Connor apparently did not know that the restaurant, Bankers and
Brokers, was managed by an alleged Gambino family associate, Phillip
Modica, law enforcement officials said.
   At the bail hearing, Assistant District Attorney Michael
Cherkasky asked acting state Supreme Court Justice George Roberts to
hold Gotti and Anthony (Tony Lee) Guerrieri without bail, saying
they would likely flee if released.
   Bruce Cutler, Gotti's lawyer, said his client had strong roots in
New York and would not flee. ``He's not going no place. He has never
run away from a problem,'' said Cutler.
   Roberts set Gotti's bail at $100,000, and about an hour later the
48-year-old Gotti was back on the streets.
   Guerrieri, 60, who also pleaded innocent, was freed on $50,000
bail. The judge ordered the two to return to court on Monday.
   The third man named in the indictment, Angelo Ruggiero, whom the
FBI identified as a captain in the Gambino family, remained at a New
York hospital where he is undergoing treatment. He was arrested at
the hospital on Monday and will be arraigned later, Morgenthau said.
   Dozens of police officers, district attorney's detectives, FBI
agents and investigators from the state Organized Crime Task Force
descended on the Little Italy section of lower Manhattan Monday
afternoon to arrest Gotti.
   Morgenthau said investigators learned through electronic
surveillance that a contract to kill O'Connor had been given by the
Gambino group to the leader of the Westies, a crime gang that
operated on Manhattan's West Side.
   Several members of the Westies were named as co-conspirators in
the indictment but were not charged.
   At the news conference, Morgenthau insisted that his office had
not been slow in indicting Gotti, saying: ``When we had all of the
evidence that we needed, we proceeded very fast.''
   He would not say what the new evidence was.

   Air Force safety officers have completed the
investigations of two B-1B bomber crashes last November and portions
of their reports will be released soon, defense sources said Tuesday.
   The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the
investigators had not changed their previously reported conclusions
that one crash appeared to involve crew error and the other a
fuel-line fire inside a wing.
   The sources said the Nov. 17 crash of a B-1B at Ellsworth Air
Force Base, S.D., occurred while the crew was practicing instrument
landing approaches ``and the indications are that it was pilot
error.''
   An earlier crash, Nov. 8 near Dyess Air Force Base, Texas,
``stemmed from a fire from a fuel line that ruptured inside the left
wing,'' added one official.
   The source said the investigators were expected to detail whether
the fuel line ruptured because of maintenance mistakes or problems
with the original installation.

<TEXT>
   Theater director Yuri Lyubimov returned to Moscow
on Tuesday to direct a play at the theater from which he was barred
five years ago. Ballerina Natalia Makarova stepped onto the stage of
the Kirov Theater for the first time since she fled in 1970.
   The homecoming of the famed Soviet-born artists, unmentionable in
their country's own press until recently, marked another lowering of
barriers in President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive to open Soviet
society.
   Meanwhile, the government newspaper Izvestia suggested that
returning Mstislav Rostropovich's Soviet citizenship would ``restore
justice'' to the famed conductor of the National Symphony in the
United States.
   Rostropovich and his wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, were
stripped of their Soviet citizenship in 1978, four years after
leaving the Soviet Union in search of ``artistic liberty.''
   Izvestia published an interview Monday that the conductor gave to
its Paris correspondent, Yuri Kovalenko. Kovalenko said in his
article that ``to return Soviet citizenship to Vishnevskaya and
Rostropovich means to restore justice.''
   ``We did not humiliate ourselves'' by publishing the works of
other exile artists and authors, the article said. ``Our national
pride was just increased. And the attempts to divide the great
Russian culture by a deaf, soundproof wall have inflicted serious
damage.''
   Tass, the Soviet news agency, reported that Lyubimov arrived in
Moscow Tuesday at the invitation of the present management of the
Taganka Theater, where his politically daring plays and avant-garde
interpretations made him a controversial figure in the Soviet
cultural world.
   After Soviet authorities had refused to let him stage three plays
in the theater he founded, he was fired and eventually stripped of
his citizenship.
   He continued his work in Europe and directed his well-known
interpretation of Dostoyevsky's ``Crime and Punishment'' in the
United States in 1987. Lyubimov visited Moscow briefly last year but
did not direct.
   Tass said Tuesday he plans to stage Boris Mozhaev's ``Alive,'' a
play he tried to put on 20 years ago but which was ``banned by
bureaucrats in the cultural sphere.''
   ``Now Lyubimov will complete his work,'' the news agency said.
   Miss Makarova, 48, renowned on the Kirov stage in Leningrad in
the 1950s and 1960s when she danced with Rudolf Nureyev, broke into
tears when she returned to the theater Tuesday, Tass reported.
   She fled her troupe during a London tour in 1970, saying she
wanted to broaden her career by performing modern dances not staged
in the Soviet Union. She is scheduled to dance a pas de deux from
the Russian ballet ``Onegin'' with her partner Alexander Sombart on
Thursday.
   ``Several years ago, I could not even dream of returning to
Leningrad as a dancing ballerina,'' Tass quoted her as saying.
``However, now it has come true, and I can now embrace my mother. I
rejoice at the changes taking place in my native country.''
   The official news agency referred to her as ``our guest from
London.''

   Dobson: Let's go back then to those roots. First of all, as I
understand it, you were raised in what you considered to have been a
healthy home. You were not physically abused, you were not sexually
abused, you were not emotionally abused.
   Bundy: No. No. And that's part of the tragedy of this whole
situation. Because I grew up in a wonderful home with two dedicated
and loving parents, as one of five brothers and sisters, a home
where we as children were the focus of my parents' lives, where we
regularly attended church, two Christian parents who did not drink,
they did not smoke, there was no gambling, no physical abuse, not
fighting in the home.
   I'm not saying this was `Leave It To Beaver.' I don't know that
such a home exists, but it was a fine, solid Christian home and
nobody, I hope no one will try to take the easy way and try to blame
or otherwise accuse my family of contributing to this because I
know, and I am trying to tell you as honestly as I know how what
happened.
   This is the message I want to get across, that as a young boy,
and I mean a boy of 12 or 13 certainly, that I encountered, outside
the home again, in the local grocery store, in a local drug store,
the soft-core pornography that people called soft core. As I think
as I explained to you last night Dr. Dobson in an anecdote, as young
boys do, we explored the back roads and sideways and byways of our
neighborhood and often times people would dump the garbage and
whatever they were putting out of their house. And from time to time
we would come across pornographic books of a harder nature than, of
a more graphic, explicit nature than we would encounter at the local
grocery store. And this also inclouded such things as detective
magazines.
   Dobson: Those that involved violence?
   Bundy: Yes, yes, and this is something I think I want to
emphasize is that the most-damaging kinds of pornography, and again
I'm talking from personal experience, ... are those that involve
violence and sexual violence. Because the wedding of those two
forces is, as I know only too well, brings out the hatred that is
just, just too terrible to describe.
   Dobson: Now, walk me through that, what was going on in your mind
at that time?
   Bundy: Before we go any further, I think it's important to me
that people believe what I am saying. I tell you that I am not
blaming pornography. I am not saying that it caused me to go out and
do certain things. And I take full responsibility for whatever I
have done, and all the things I have done. That's not the question
here.
   The question and the issue is how this kind of literature
contributed and helped mold and shape the kinds of violent behavior
...
   Dobson: It fueled your fantasies, didn't it?
   Bundy: In the beginning it fuels this kind of thought process,
then at a certain time, it is instrumental, I would say
crystalizing, making into something which is almost like a separate
entity inside. At that point, I was at the verge of acting out in
this kind ...

   Dobson: Now, I really want to understand that. You had gone about
as far as you could in your own fantasy life with printed material,
or printed and film ... and then there was the urge to take that
little step, or big step over to a physical event?
   Bundy: And it happened in stages, gradually. It didn't
necessarily, not to me at least, happen overnight. My experience
with pornography generally, but with pornography that deals on a
violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it, and
I look at this as a kind of addiction like other kinds of addiction,
I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic
kinds of material.
   Like an addiction, you keep craving something that is harder,
harder, something which, which gives you a greater sense of
excitement. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes
so far, you reach that jumping off point where you begin to wonder
if maybe actually doing it would give you that which is beyond just
reading it or looking at it.
   Dobson: How long did you stay at that point before you actually
assaulted someone?
   Bundy: Well, yeah. That is a very delicate point, by the way in
my own development. We're talking about something ... about having
reached the point or gray area that, that surrounded that point over
a course of years.
   I would say a couple of years. What I was dealing with there was
very strong inhibitions against criminal behavior or violent
behavior that had been conditioned into me, bred into me in my
environment, in my neighborhood, in my church, in my school, things
that said, `No, this is wrong. Even to think of it is wrong, but
certainly to do it is wrong.' I'm on that edge, I would say the last
vestiges of restraint, the barriers to actually doing something are
being tested constantly, assailed through the kind of fantasy life
that was fueled largely by pornography.
   Dobson: Do you remember what pushed you over that edge? Do you
remember the decision to go for it, do you remember you decided to
throw caution to the wind?
   Bundy: When you say pushed, I know what you're saying. I don't
want to infer again that I was some helpless kind of victim in that
we're talking about an influence that is an influence of violent
types of media, violent types of pornography which had an
indispensible in the chain ... of events that led to the behavior
... the assaults, the murders.
   It's a very difficult thing to describe, the sensation of
reaching that point where I knew that, that something had say
snapped, that I knew that I couldn't control anymore, that the
barriers I had ... learned as a child, had been instilled in me,
were not enough to hold me back in respect to seeking out and
harming somebody.
   Dobson: Would it be accurate to call that a frenzy, a sexual
frenzy?
   Bundy: Yes, that's one way to describe it, a compulsion ... a
building up of this destructive energy. Another factor here I
haven't mentioned is the use of alcohol. What alcohol did in
conjuction with exposure to pornography is alcohol reduced my
inhibitions at the same time the fantasy life that was fueld by
pornography eroded them further.
   Dobson: In the early days, you were nearly always about half
drunk when you did these things, is that right?
   Bundy: Yes.
   Dobson: Was that always true?
   Bundy: I would say that that was generally the case.
   Dobson: All right, if I can understand it, there is this battle
going on within, there are the conventions that you have been
taught, there's the right and wrong that you learned as a child, and
then there is this unbridled passion fueled by your plunge into
hard-core, violent pornography and those things are at war with each
other? And then with the alchol diminishing the inhibitions, you let
go?
   Bundy: Yes, and it's accurate. It just occurred to me that some
people will say that `Well, I've seen that stuff and it doesn't do
anything to me.' And I can understand that. Virtually everyone can
be exposed to pornography and while they are aroused to one degree
or another, they do not go out and do anything wrong.
   Dobson: Addictions are like that. They affect some people more
than they affect others. But there is a percentage of people
affected by hard-core pornography in a very violent way and you are
obviously one of them.

   One of America's most notorious multiple murderers, Ted Bundy,
was executed Tuesday in Florida. Here is a brief look at other
recent serial killers, their crimes and punishment:
   
   JOHN WAYNE GACY, on death row in Illinois since 1980, was
convicted in 1979 of the murders of 33 young men and boys from 1972
to 1978. Authorities discovered 27 bodies buried in shallow graves
in the crawl space underneath Gacy's suburban Chicago home. Two more
bodies were found on his property and four were recovered from
nearby rivers.
   PATRICK WAYNE KEARNEY confessed in 1977 to killing 32 men along
southern California highways. He was convicted of 21 of the ``Trash
Bag'' murders _ so-called because many of the dismembered remains of
victims were dumped in trash bags _ and sentenced to life in prison.
   GERALD STANO, who claims to have killed 41 women in three states,
is on death row in Florida appealing his 1983 death sentence for the
murders of two Florida women. Although Stano has been sentenced on
only 10 murders, receiving seven life sentences and three death
penalties, investigators say they have documented 25 of the murders
claimed by Stano in Florida. Less is known about murders Stano
admitted to in the New Jersey-Pennsylvania area.
   DONALD HARVEY, a former Ohio nurse's aide known as the ``Angel of
Death,'' confessed to murdering 58 people over a 17-year period.
Many of Harvey's victims were suffocated. He claimed most were
killed out of mercy, but some in malice. Harvey was caught after a
medical examiner smelled cyanide while performing an autopsy on a
victim. Harvey is serving several life sentences in Ohio.
   WILLIAM BONIN, an unemployed truck driver, became known as
California's ``Freeway Killer.'' He was convicted of murdering 10
boys and young men and abandoning their bodies near freeways in 1979
and 1980.
   HENRY LEE LUCAS, a one-eyed drifter, has been convicted in 13
murders in the West and Southwest. He once claimed involvement in
more than 360 murders nationwide, but later repudiated his
confession.
   ALBERT DeSALVO, ``The Boston Strangler,'' killed 13 women in the
Boston area from 1962 to 1964. Confessed to being the strangler, but
police lacked the evidence to bring him to trial for the killings.
Instead, he was tried on a series of unrelated assaults, convicted
and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was stabbed to death in his
cell in 1973.
   JUAN CORONA was found guilty of the slayings of 25 farm workers
whose bodies were found in Yuba City, Calif. in 1971, and is serving
a life sentence.
   ``THE NIGHT STALKER,'' a random killer who struck in a
seven-month rampage during 1984-85 that panicked Californians. He
typically entered homes through unlocked doors and windows, raped
women, killed both men and women, and stole jewelry and other
valuables. Richard Ramirez, a drifter whom authorities have tied to
the killings, is standing trial for 14 murders and 31 other felony
counts.
   ``THE GREEN RIVER KILLER,'' officially blamed for the deaths of
as many as 48 young women in Washington state and Oregon in 1982-84.
Many victims were prostitutes and were known to frequent the Sea-Tac
Strip, near the Seattle-Tacoma airport. Some investigators in the
San Diego area believe the killings there of about 40 women since
1985, many of them connected with drugs and prostitution, may be the
work of Seattle's murderer.
   ``THE SOUTHSIDE SLAYER,'' believed responsible for 17 murders in
south-central Los Angeles and nearby suburbs. All the victims are
women, all but three were black, and most were prostitutes. The
slayings date back to September 1983.

   A minister facing damaging testimony from
Jessica Hahn, the woman who brought down PTL evangelist Jim Bakker,
pleaded guilty Tuesday to reduced charges before the start of his
tax evasion trial.
   The surprise decision by Eugene Profeta to plead guilty to two of
18 state charges against him came just before Hahn, his former
secretary, was to testify during an evidence suppression hearing.
   Profeta, of Long Island, admitted in court that he tried to get
Hahn to lie to grand jurors investigating his financial dealings and
to filing a false 1986 income tax return.
   He declined comment after he and his wife, Glenda, left the
courtroom. State prosecutors agreed to drop charges against Profeta
that he skimmed funds from his Massapequa church for personal use
and to drop income tax evasion charges against his wife.
   ``He's a wimp,'' Hahn said of Profeta at a news conference
outside the courtroom. ``He couldn't say that `I made a mistake' and
because of that I lost my family. You know, I've paid a price. And
by the grace of God I've been able to turn it around.''
   The former church secretary, whose 1980 sexual encounter with
Bakker led to the downfall of his PTL ministry, became a celebrity
and posed nude for Playboy magazine in the wake of revelations about
their liaison.
   Hahn, who worked as a secretary for Profeta both before and after
the encounter with Bakker, also said she had an affair with the Long
Island minister. She had earlier said she turned to him for solace
after the Bakker incident.
   At the evidence suppression hearing Monday, a New York state
investigator testified that Hahn told him she received $12,000 from
PTL in what ``sounded like extortion'' and that she spent $7,000 on
cocaine.
   A tearful Hahn admitted to reporters Tuesday that she
``experimented with cocaine'' and tried to hurt Bakker by taking
$12,000 from the PTL ministry in exchange for a promise not to talk
about their sexual encounter.
   She said she tried to give the money back, but that PTL officials
refused to relinquish a signed document saying she wouldn't talk
about the sexual encounter.
   Hahn refused to say how much money she spent on cocaine.
   ``It was a hard time in my life,'' said Hahn, now seeking
employment as a disc jockey. `` ... I'm not using anything now. This
was just a three-month period in my life.''
   Under the plea bargain agreement, Profeta is to be sentenced to
six months in jail and five months' probation, pay a $5,000 fine and
$13,000 in back taxes. He also was ordered by state Supreme Court
Justice Joseph Harris to stay away from Hahn.
   Hahn testified before a grand jury investigating Profeta and
taped telephone coversations with him in exchange for the state's
agreement not to prosecute her.
   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams called Profeta's plea
bargain agreement appropriate.

<BYLINE>Budget Makes Japan World Leader In Foreign Aid ^By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet adopted a budget Tuesday that makes
Japan the top provider of foreign aid, increases its defense
spending and boosts its share of the cost of keeping U.S. troops in
Japan.
   The total budget raises government spending by 6.6 percent _ the
largest increase in eight years _ to $471.95 billion. The government
budget for fiscal 1988, which ends on March 31, was $441 billion.
   In negotiations after the Finance Ministry's budget proposal was
presented last week, the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Agency won
increases in Japan's foreign aid and defense spending.
   A Foreign Ministry official said economic assistance to
developing countries is likely to exceed $11 billion in fiscal 1989,
up from an estimated $10 billion in fiscal 1988. That would put
Japan ahead of the United States as the world's largest donor of
foreign aid based on estimates by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.
   Due to differing fiscal years and accounting techniques, it is
difficult to draw direct comparisons between foreign aid budgets.
The $14.5 billion U.S. foreign aid proposal for the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1 includes military aid. Japan's aid budget includes
no military expenditures.
   Measured against the size of its economy, Japan's aid is not
outstandingly generous. This year it will be about 0.3 percent of
the gross national product, higher than the U.S. rate of 0.23
percent but below the average of 0.36 percent among major Western
donor nations.
   Japan's Defense Agency, limited by law to defensive capabilities,
will have a budget of $30.6 billion in fiscal 1989, up 5.9 percent
from this year's $28.78 billion, said Toshinori Shigeie, director of
the Foreign Ministry's national security affairs division.
   The increase will enable Japan to meet fourth-year plans in a
five-year program to beef up Japan's defense capabilities,
particularly its ability to defend its sea lanes, Shigeie said.
   Washington has urged Tokyo to do more for its own defense, but
military spending is controversial in Japan. Its constitution
renounces war and the use of force to settle international disputes.
   Japan has agreed to shoulder a larger share of the costs of
maintaining 64,000 U.S. troops here. In fiscal 1989, it will spend
$1.11 billion, or about 75 percent of the total cost, moving closer
to its goal of 100 percent.
   Of that amount, $695.3 million will be used to improve U.S.
military facilities in Japan, up 12.5 percent from this fiscal year,
and $415.6 million will go to support the 20,000 Japanese employees
of U.S. bases.
   Until fiscal 1987, Japan limited defense spending to 1 percent of
its gross national product _ the total value of its goods and
services. In fiscal 1987, defense spending amounted to 1.013 percent
of GNP, and in fiscal 1988 and 1989 the military budget will be just
above 1 percent of GNP, based on Finance Ministry estimates.
   Japan's GNP is forecast to reach $3.04 trillion in fiscal 1989,
up 4 percent from $2.89 trillion in fiscal 1988.
   Measured against the size of its economy, Japan's aid is not
outstandingly generous. This year it will be about 0.3 percent of
the gross national product, higher than the U.S. rate of 0.23
percent but below the average of 0.36 percent among major Western
donor nations.
   The government has announced it will double its official
development assistance to more than $50 billion for the five-year
period ending in calendar 1992 in a bid to promote Japan's
international contribution as a major economic power.
   In fiscal 1989, Japan's foreign aid allocations will include $228
million for measures equivalent to cancellation of the debts of some
least developed nations, said Shigeo Iwatani, senior assistant for
economic cooperation.
   They also will include, for the first time, $1.56 million for
small non-governmental organizations that provide emergency relief
and long-term grassroots assistance in developing nations.
   Iwatani said the ratio of outright grants to loans in Japan was
not available, but said the proportion of grants would be higher
than the 47.3 percent recorded in calendar 1987.
   He said Japan is adding personnel and strengthening research and
evaluation of aid projects in response to criticism that the
projects are poorly supervised and that loans usually provide
contracts for Japanese companies.
   ``We are trying to improve the quality of Japan's aid,'' Iwatani
said. ``Development assistance is a new field for Japan.''
   The government's budget proposal, which followed five days of
negotiations between the Finance Ministry and other government
bodies, is expected to go to Parliament for approval on Jan. 31.

   Condemned killer Ted Bundy told an
interviewer on the eve of his execution that ``I deserve the most
extreme punishment society has.'' But he said he didn't want to die.
   Bundy, the 42-year-old confessed killer of more than 20 young
women in four states, was executed in Florida's electric chair early
Tuesday for the kidnap, rape and murder of 12-year-old Kimberly
Leach of Lake City.
   Although he said he felt remorse for all of his sex-related
murders, Bundy said, ``There is no way in the world that killing me
is going to restore those beautiful children to their parents.''
   Toward the beginning of a videotaped interview with California
psychologist James Dobson at Florida State Prison, Bundy said he
took full responsibility ``for all the things I've done.''
   But he said they were te result of ``a fantasy life fueled by
hard-core pornography'' and alcohol.
   He said he had essentially a normal upbringing in a Christian
family, and ``I am essentially a normal person. ... except for this
destructive segment.''
   Bundy, handcuffed and sitting at a table across from Dobson,
alternately sobbed and smiled during the 29-minute interview. He was
dressed in the peach-colored, short-sleeved shirt worn by Death Row
inmates. And he seemed to ponder each question and answer carefully,
sometimes pausing at length before answering.
   Dobson, who has a daily radio program heard in 35 countries over
1,200 radio stations, inquired about the killer's youngest victim,
Kimberly Leach. ``What did you feel after that?'' he asked Bundy.
   Bundy held his hands to his face, closed his eyes and thought for
a long time before responding: ``I can't talk about that right now
... It's too painful. I can't do it ... I can't begin to understand
... the pain of these parents.''
   At one point, he told his interviewer that he ``felt the full
range of guilt and remorse'' but that he had it
``compartmentalized'' in his brain.
   He said it was ``important to me that I'm not blaming
pornography. . . I take full responsibility.'' But he said hard-core
pornography ``guided and shaped'' what he did.
   After he committed his first murder, ``What were the emotional
effects on you? What happened in the days after that?'' Dobson asked.
   ``It was like coming out of some horrible trance. ... It was like
being possessed by something so awful, so alien.
   ``I was absolutely horrified that I was capable of doing
something like that.''

<TEXT>
   A draftsman for a chemical company told
investigators his firm shipped chemicals to Libya and that employees
helped build a chemical weapons plant, West German television
reported Tuesday night.
   Also Tuesday, the newsmagazine Stern reported that a West German
government-owned company knew blueprints that were supposed to be
shipped to Hong Kong to build a pharmaceuticals plant had ended up
in Libya.
   The ARD television network said in an evening news broadcast that
Klaus Hess, a technical draftsman with Imhausen-Chemie, told West
German investigators the company had a key role in the Libyan
complex in Rabta, 60 miles south of Tripoli.
   It was the first report of an employee of Imhausen-Chemie
confirming allegations the company was involved in building the
plant.
   The U.S. government says the plant can make poison gas, an
allegation Bonn officials now support. Libya says the plant will
manufacture medicine.
   ``Klaus Hess is said to have given evidence that Imhausen shipped
parts and chemicals to Libya, and further that Imhausen employees
helped build the facility in Rabta,'' ARD reported.
   Imhausen-Chemie has denied accusations, first raised by U.S.
officials, that it was involved in the Rabta plant.
   ARD did not disclose where it initially got its information but
said it was confirmed by the Federal Prosecutor's Office in
Karlsruhe. The television also did not say if the employees traveled
to Libya to work on the plant.
   Earlier Tuesday, Stern magazine said an official at
Imhausen-Chemie told investigators that officials at Imhausen and
the government-owned Salzgitter Industriebau GmbH knew that
shipments of Salzgitter blueprints ended up in Libya instead of Hong
Kong.
   The Hamburg-based weekly did not name the official and it was not
known whether it was the same person identified in the ARD report.
   Salzgitter officials acknowledged last week that it had done
business with Imhausen-Chemie but said that was for construction of
a pharmaceuticals plant in Hong Kong. Salzgitter officials late
Tuesday denied any involvement in the project in Libya.
   Stern said ``it was also clear to experts'' with Salzgitter that
the Libyan plant was not designed as a ``small factory for
pharmaceuticals,'' but a ``large chemical plant for the production
of highly poisonous substances.''
   Stern reported last week that Salzgitter, which manufactures
steel products and industrial equipment, delivered blueprints for
the Libyan plant.
   Salzgitter Industriebau GmbH is a subsidiary of Salzgitter AG,
and both are wholly owned by the West German federal government.
   Karlheinz von den Driesch, spokesman for the Finance Ministry,
said he could not comment on the Stern report. But he also told
reporters the allegations will be investigated.
   A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Offenburg confirmed
that an Imhausen-Chemie employee was questioned, but he declined to
reveal what that person told investigators. The spokesman, Hubertus
Voegele, spoke in an interview with Sueddeutscher Runkfunk radio.
   Prosecutors are investigating Imhausen-Chemie, based in the Black
Forest town of Lahr, and other West German companies for their
alleged roles in the Libyan complex.
   Last week, Stern said that the Hong Kong project, called ``Pharma
150,'' was devised to disguise involvement by Imhausen-Chemie in
helping build the plant in Libya, which has the same name.
   The magazine on Tuesday said the giant West German electrical
firm Siemens sold switching and measuring equipment for ``Pharma
150.''
   Siemens spokesman Horst Siebert said the company had delivered
equipment to Hong Kong but denied it had done anything wrong.
   Stern telexed its report Tuesday to other news organizations in
advance of Thursday's publication.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied on
Tuesday that President Bush apologized to Chancellor Helmut Kohl
about news stories alleging West German involvement in the Libyan
plant.
   Friedhelm Ost, Kohl's chief spokesman, said in Bonn on Monday
that Bush ``regretted'' commentaries in American newspapers that
harshly criticized West Germany over the Libyan scandal because they
failed to ``take into account'' the West German government's efforts
to prevent the production of chemical weapons.

<HEAD>Editor Nominated For New Parliament in Stormy Meeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In more than four hours of passionate debate
Tuesday, nearly 1,200 Muscovites nominated the editor of a
freewheeling weekly magazine for a new national legislature charged
with carrying out reforms.
   Vitaly Korotich of Ogonyok magazine, criticized in press and
hounded by Russian nationalists, lost two previous tries for
nomination. Backers at the Dzerzhinsky district meeting, however,
overwhelmingly moved him to the next stage of the complex process
leading to elections March 26.
   While supporters and opponents debated his reformist philosophy,
the editor was in the United States on one of several recent trips
abroad.
   Vladimir Tsvetov, a television reporter who spoke for the
candidacy, said Korotich and others like him make President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reform effort credible to foreigners.
   ``We are on the edge,'' and the Soviet Union can become a
``great, free socialist country'' or bog down in bureaucracy again,
Tsvetov said.
   A small middle-aged woman wearing glasses and a gray sweater
grabbed a microphone, but when the crowd heard the words
``Korotich'' and ``slander'' a chant of ``Down with Pamyat!''
drowned her out.
   Several young members of Pamyat, a Russian nationalist group
accused of anti-Semitism, raised banners in the back of the hall
criticizing Korotich. There was a crush of people straining to see,
then a roar of disapproval.
   Ogonyok reported earlier this month that Pamyat members broke up
an electoral meeting called to nominate Korotich for the
2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies.
   On Jan. 18, the government newspaper Izvestia implied Korotich
supporters also were involved in the disorder. The Communist Party
paper Pravda printed a letter denouncing his magazine as ``scum''
that defames the Soviet Union.
   When the 995 green cards that counted as ballots Tuesday were
collected and counted, Korotich had 787. Yuri Skokov, an electronics
institute director who stressed economic reform, got 145.
   Pyotr Makarin, a city official running the meeting, spent the
evening trying to shout over people who used any pause to comment or
ask questions from the floor.
   He stopped the meeting at one point and called out: ``We will sit
and wait until we restore elementary order!'' The crowd gradually
quieted.
   After the earlier meeting was broken up, Korotich also lost in a
try at the writers' union slate. Such other backers of reform as
Andrei D. Sakharov, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, have been passed
over by their professional groups and had to seek endorsement
elsewhere.
   Sakharov said last week the system for choosing candidates, which
became law in December, should be more democratic.
   Under Korotich's leadership, Ogonyok has printed many sensational
stories about social problems and corruption of former leaders.
Recent issues revealed long-hidden statistics on the number of
suicides in the Soviet Union and carried stories about the
son-in-law of the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev, who was
convicted of corruption in late December.
   Such articles have created ardent supporters and passionate
critics.
   Nearly an hour before Tuesday's meeting, scores of people jammed
near the entrance of trade union hall in cold, clear weather.
   They broke a pane of glass next to the entrance and shouted:
``The door! The door!'' at officials who had locked the entrance
because a quorum of 500 people had been assured and there was no
more room.
   A man at the edge of the crowd muttered: ``They don't need
Korotich; they need a Stalinist camp,'' referring to the vast labor
colonies set up during Josef Stalin's purges.
   Officials finally relented and let in the crowd, which jammed the
aisles throughout the meeting.
   One third of the legislature's members will come from
geographical districts like Dzerzhinsky and another third from
districts representing ethnic groups. The rest are being chosen by
the Communist Party and its affiliates, trade unions and
professional and social organizations.
   Korotich's nomination now goes to a district electoral commission
that will decide which candidates are put on the ballot.

   Mayor Eugene Sawyer picked up the endorsement of
Jesse Jackson on Tuesday in his bid to solidify black support and
block Richard M. Daley from attaining the mayoral post long held by
his late father.
   Jackson appeared with Sawyer, 54, on a packed stage at a South
Side community center to formally endorse the mayor in the city's
Feb. 28 Democratic mayoral primary. Sawyer, who is black, is being
challenged by Daley, 44, who is white and considered the
front-runner.
   Jackson called Sawyer ``a healer'' who has continued city
programs started by the late Mayor Harold Washington, the city's
first black mayor.
   Sawyer, who was elected mayor by the City Council a week after
Washington's death, said Jackson's endorsement would energize his
campaign.
   Jackson said he waited until just five weeks before the primary
to announce his endorsement because of deep divisions in the largely
black coalition that boosted Washington into the mayor's office in
1983.
   His endorsement came a day after Sawyer's leading black
challenger, Alderman Timothy Evans, filed for election in a
third-party bid designed to avoid a split in the black primary vote
that would give an edge to Daley.
   Many Washington backers have called Evans, 45, the heir-apparent
to Washington, who died of a heart attack in November 1987.
   Jackson, who has been considered an Evans ally, said his
endorsement of Sawyer applied only to the primary _ not the April 4
general mayoral election in which Evans would run.
   Jackson charged that Daley, the Cook County state's attorney and
son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, had sent ``a signal'' by
singling out three blacks _ Health Commissioner Dr. Lonnie Edwards,
Chicago schools Superintendent Manford Byrd, and Police Chief Leroy
Martin _ as people he would replace.
   Avis LaVelle, Daley's press secretary, said Jackson was wrong in
his assertions. She said Daley has suggested that Edwards resign,
that Byrd be given a six-month contract extension, and has said
nothing definite about Martin.
   Evans is seeking to bypass the primary and run under the Harold
Washington party banner in the April special election to fill the
remaining two years of Washington's term.
   Other Democratic primary contenders are Alderman Lawrence Bloom,
a white Washington ally; James Taylor, a former state legislator,
and Sheila Jones, a Lyndon LaRouche backer. Four others are seeking
the Republican nomination.

<HEAD>Dutch Government Proposes Release Of World War II War Criminals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday proposed
pardoning the two longest-held Nazi war criminals in the West. A
World War II resistance group criticized the idea.
   The case of the two aging German nationals, convicted for their
roles in deporting thousands of Dutch Jews to Nazi death camps, has
been the focus of a bitter public debate here ever since the
government first proposed releasing them in 1972.
   The 43-year-long detention of Franz Fischer, 87, and Ferdinand
aus der Fuenten, 79, also illustrates the sensitivities still
surrounding this nation's suffering under the 1940-1945 Nazi German
occupation.
   The government argues that because five other war criminals who
faced death sentences have been pardoned and released, continued
detainment of the two men would violate the principle of equality
before the law.
   Dutch Justice Minister Frits Korthals Altes, who made the
proposal in a letter to Parliament, said the move follows a plea for
clemency by a group of 19 prominent victims of Nazi persecution, and
a series of secret talks between that group and the government that
began last summer.
   The proposal requires approval by the 150-seat Parliament, where
it is expected to come under heavy fire.
   In the letter, Korthals Altes said, ``There are still victims of
persecution and participants in the former resistance who ... will
be deeply agitated'' if the two men are released.
   Bill Minco, spokesman for the of the Joint Resistance Foundation,
which opposes the pardons, told a news conference: ``It's not they
who are serving a life sentence; it's the victims of the Nazis who
are serving a life term. ... Their wounds will remain open forever.''
   In 1987, a public opinion poll showed two thirds of the Dutch
population opposed releasing the two war criminals.
   But Theo van Lier, one of the 19 people who signed the plea for
release of the two men, said, ``Since we spent the war fighting for
the rule of law ... we should now abide by it ourselves.''
   Since the 1987 death in Berlin's Spandau prison of Rudolf Hess,
Adolf Hitler's deputy, Fischer and aus der Fuenten have been the
only war criminals known to have been detained since World War II.
   Former resistance fighters, concentration camp inmates and many
of the 6,000 Dutch Jews who survived the Holocaust have repeatedly
argued against releasing the two men, whose death sentences have
been commuted into life imprisonment.
   The Netherlands' Jewish population numbered 150,000 before the
war.
   Known as the ``Breda Two'' for the southern Dutch city where they
are being jailed, Fischer and aus der Fuenten were arrested by
Allied troops in 1945 and sentenced in 1950.
   ``Thanks to the quality of Dutch jails, they are still in
excellent health,'' said Minco.
   Last summer, a team of prison doctors concluded the Breda Two's
physical and mental condition was good enough to warrant continued
detention.
   Aus der Fuenten, a former captain in the Nazi's elite SS police,
personally oversaw the deportation of Dutch Jews from Amsterdam,
Rotterdam and The Hague, as well as the Westerbork concentration
camp in the northeastern Netherlands.
   Fischer headed the Jewish Section of the local branch of the Nazi
Security Service in The Hague.

   Bundy: That was a major component and I don't know why I was
vulnerable to it, all I know is that it had an impact on me that was
just so central to the development of the violent behavior that I
had reached. ...
   Dobson: Ted, after you committed your first murder, what was the
emotional effect on you? What happened in the days after that?
   Bundy: (long pause) Please understand, that even all these years
later it is very difficult to talk about and reliving through
talking about it is difficult, to say the least, but I want you to
understand what happened. It was like coming out of some kind of
horrible trance or dream. I can only liken it to after, I don't want
to overdramatize it, but to having been possessed by something so
awful and so alien, then the next morning wake up from it, remember
what happened and realize that basically, I mean in the eyes of the
law and certainly in the eyes of God, you were responsible; to wake
up in the morning and realize what I had done and with a clear mind
and all my essential moral and ethical feelings intact at that
moment, absolutely horrified that I was capable of doing something
...
   Dobson: You really hadn't known that before?
   Bundy: There is just absolutely no way to describe first the
brutal urge to do that kind of thing and then what happens is once
it has been more or less satisfied and recedes, you might say, or
spent, that energy level recedes and basically I became myself again.
   I want people to understand this too, and I'm not saying this
gratuitously because it's important that you understand this. But
basically, I was a normal person, I wasn't some guy hanging out at
bars, or a bum. I wasn't a pevert in the sense that people look at
somebody and say I know there is something wrong with him, you can
just tell. I was essentially a normal person. I had good friends, I
led a normal life, except for this one, small but very potent and
very destructive segment of it that I kept vey secret and close to
myself and didn't let anyone know about. And part of the shock and
horror to my dear friends and family years ago when I was first
arrested was there was no clue. They looked at me and they looked at
the All-American boy. I wasn't perfect, ... but I was OK. I was. The
basic humanity and the basic spirit that God gave me was intact, but
unfortunately became overwhelmed at times.
   And people need to recognize it's not some kind of ... those of
us who are or who have been so much influenced by violence in the
media, in particular pornographic violence, are not some kind of
inherent monsters. We are your sons and we are your husbands and we
grew up in regular families. And pornography can reach out and
snatch a kid out of any house today. It snatched me out of my home
20, 30 years ago and as dedicated as my parents were, and they were
diligent in protecting their children and as good a Christian home
as we had, and we had a wonderful Christian home, there is no
protection against the kind of influences that are loose in society
that tolerates. ...

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake shook Hokkaido early Wednesday,
temporarily cutting off electricity to more than 2,000 households,
authorities said.
   The quake, which hit Japan's northern island at 5:03 a.m. (3:03
p.m. EST Tuesday), had a preliminary reading of 5.8 on the Richter
scale. No serious injury or property damage was reported, said
Toshio Okawa, a police officer in Urakawa, about 400 miles north of
Tokyo.
   ``At first there was a sudden shaking ... then things began to
reel horizontally for about 30 seconds,'' Okawa said. He said the
quake knocked out power to about half of the 4,500 households in
Urakawa but that power was restored two hours later.
   The Central Meteorological Agency the quake was centered 24 miles
underground in the eastern Hidaka region of southern Hokkaido.
   Urakawa, a southern Hokkaido port town with a population of
18,000, was hardest hit by the temblor, which registered 4 on the
Japanese scale of 7 locally, the agency said. Other communities in
the region recorded a reading of 3, according to the agency.
   A quake of 4 on the Japanese scale is considered ``strong,''
shaking houses and buildings and overturning objects on shelves.
   On the Richter scale, which measures magnitude at the epicenter,
a quake of 5 can cause considerable damage and a 6 severe damage in
populated areas.
   A Central Meteorological Agency official said the latest tremor
was one of a long series of earthquakes along the Hidaka Mountain
range. Most have been minor.
   He also said the earthquake had no connection to Mount Tokachi, a
volcano in central Hokkaido that has shown signs of activity in
recent weeks.
   The 6,923-foot mountain erupted last month for the first time in
26 years. Since then it has erupted sporadically on a small scale,
sending up columns of smoke and releasing volcanic ash over
neigboring towns.

   Dobson: You feel this really deeply don't you? Ted, outside these
walls, right now, there are several hundred reporters who wanted to
talk to you and you asked me to come here from California because
you had something to say. This hour that we have together, is not
just an interview with a man who is scheduled to die tomorrow
morning. I am here and you are here because of this message that you
are talking about here. You really feel that hard-core pornography
and the doorway to it, soft-core pornography, is doing untold damage
to other people and causing other women to be abused and killed the
way you did others?
   Bundy: Listen. I'm no social scientist and I haven't done a
survey, I mean I don't pretend that I know what John Q. Citizen
knows about this, but I have lived in prison for a long time now,
and I've met a lot of men who were motivated to violence just like
me. And without exception, every one of them was deeply involved in
pornography, without question; without exception, deeply influenced
and consumed by an addiction. There's no question about it. The
FBI's own study on serial homicide shows that the most-common
interest among serial killers is pornography.
   Dobson: That's true. Ted, what would your life have been like
without that influence? You can only speculate.
   Bundy: (tears) Far better not just for me, and excuse me for
being so self-centered here, but it would have been a lot better for
me and lots of other people and lots of other innocent people,
victims and families, it would have been a lot better. There's no
question there would have been a fuller life, certainly a life that
would not have involved, I am absolutely certain, a life that would
not have involved this kind of violence.
   Dobson: I'm sure Ted, if I were able to ask the questions that
are being asked out there, one of the most important as you come
down to your final hours: Are you thinking about those victims out
there and their families who are so wounded and years later their
lives have not returned to normal and will not return to normal?
They will never return to normal. Are you carrying that load, that
weight. Is there remorse there?
   Bundy: Again, people will accuse me of being self-serving, but I
am just telling you how I feel. Through God's help, I have been able
to come to the point where I much too late, but better late than
never, feel the hurt and the pain that I am responsible for. Yes,
absolutely. In the past few days myself and a number of
investigators have been talking about a number of unsolved cases,
murders that I was involved in.
   It's hard to talk about all these years later because it revives
in me all those terrible feelings and thoughts that I have
steadfastly and diligently dealt with and I think successfully, and
yet its reopened that and I felt the pain and I felt the horror and
I can only hope that those who I have caused so much grief, even if
they don't believe my expression of sorrow, will believe what I am
saying now; that there is loose in the towns and their communities
people like me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day
in, day out by violence in the media in various forms, particularly
sexual violence. And what scares me and it's coming to the present
now because what I am talking about happened 30, 20, 30 years ago in
my formative state. And what scares me, Dr. Dobson, when I see
what's on cable TV, some of the movies and some of the violence in
the movies that comes into homes today, the stuff that they wouldn't
show in X-rated adult theaters 30 years ago ...
   Dobson: The slasher movies is what you're talking about ...
   Bundy: That stuff is, I'm telling you from personal experience,
is the most graphic violence on screen, particularly as it gets into
the home to children who are unattended or unaware that they may be
a Ted Bundy who has that vulnerability, that predisposition to be
influenced by that kind of behavior. ...
   There are kids out there switching the TV dial around and come
upon these movies late at night, or I don't know when they are on,
but they're on and any kid can watch them. It's scary when I think
what would have happened to me if I had seen them, and it's scary
enough, I just ran into stuff outside the home.
   But to know that children are watching that kind of thing today
or can pick up their phone and dial away for it or send away for it.

<HEAD>Prosecution Rests Case in Murder Trial of Jesse Jackson Half-Brother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecution rested its case Tuesday
against Noah Robinson after more than four days of testimony in
which Chicago gang members said the Chicago millionaire hired them
to kill a childhood friend.
   Robinson, half-brother of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a Greenville
native, is charged with murder and conspiracy in the death of Leroy
``Hambone'' Barber. He also is charged with conspiring to kill
Janice Denise Rosemond, who witnessed Barber's 1986 murder.
   Before the government wrapped up its case, Judge James E. Moore
granted a motion by defense lawyers to supress evidence seized
during a June 4 search of Robinson's Chicago home.
   Sgt. Dan Brannigan, an expert in gang-related acts for the
Chicago Police Department, testified that during the search officers
broke down a locked door to Robinson's bedroom and found a money
order receipt from a Robinson associate to Edward Cooksey, one of
four El Rukn gang members charged with murder in the Barber slaying.
   Officers also noticed phone numbers of gang members taped to a
mirror, he said.
   Robinson's lawyer, Robert Simone, argued that the officers'
actions were an unreasonable search and seizure, and Moore agreed.
   Earlier Tuesday, Simone questioned the credibility of Jackie
Clay, a former bodyguard for Robinson and a former El Rukn gang
member, who said Robinson paid him $500 to participate in the
alleged contract killing. Clay is also charged with murder in
Barber's slaying.
   Clay, who said Tuesday that he had left El Rukn in 1986,
testified a day earlier that the defendant hired El Rukn members to
come to Greenville to kill Barber, a former employee and childhood
friend of Robinson's.
   Previous trial testimony showed that Barber and Robinson had
quarreled in Greenville before Barber's death, and that Robinson
believed Barber was responsible for break-ins of buildings he owned
in Chicago.
   Robinson, a businessman, owned properties in both Chicago and
Greenville as well as a fast food franchise and a dairy company.
   Clay testified that he became a fugitive when Greenville police
issued a warrant for his arrest in the Barber murder and that
Robinson sent him money and promised legal assistance. He turned
himself in to police just before Christmas.
   During cross-examination, Simone tried to portray Clay as a
hardened criminal who made a deal with the prosecution in exchange
for testifying.
   On Monday, Clay testified that an El Rukn member told him the
gang was preparing to ``take care of Hambone for Local.'' Local was
a code name the gang used for Robinson.
   He then described how he and three other gang members traveled to
Greenville, but then quarreled over how to kill Barber. That mission
failed, but a second trip several days later ended in the fatal
shooting of Barber in front of a building owned by Robinson.
   The trial began Jan. 16.

   Rescuers saved three buried miners Tuesday and
heard faint tapping inside a rundown gold mine where up to 200 men
were trapped in a cave-in, officials said.
   Energy Minister Jose Carrasco said saboteurs set a fire that ate
through wooden supports and caused Monday's collapse. But police Lt.
Juan Robles in Nazca, the southern town near the Sol de Oro mine,
said the mine's operations were extremely disorganized, and he
blamed the collapse on poor maintenance.
   Carrasco said the tapping indicated that scores of miners might
still be alive. He said the mumber of miners trapped in the mine was
unknown but ranged from 15 to 200.
   Robles said three bodies have been recovered so far. He estimated
Tuesday that about 100 miners were trapped. Hours after the cave-in,
Robles said 150-300 miners were trapped.
   Carrasco met with civil defense officials Tuesday after reaching
Nazca, 230 miles south of Lima. He told reporters on his return to
Lima on Tuesday evening that two of the rescued men were
hospitalized and a third was only slightly injured.
   Officials said fallen earth, smoke and poison gas prevented
rescuers from entering the mine until midday Tuesday, when special
teams from state mines and the Lima fire department, supported by
air force helicopters, reached the site.
   Most officials had given up hope of finding any survivors.
   ``I have asked for 100 body bags,'' Nazca Mayor Enrique Li said
on Radio Programas.
   The bodies of three men were recovered at the mouth of the mine
on Monday. ``Two of them show signs of having died from poison
gases,'' Robles said.
   The other miners were believed to be on the second, third and
fourth levels of the mine, which is halfway up a 3,300-foot
mountain, he said.
   Carrasco told reporters at Lima's airport that opposing groups of
miners set the fires during a dispute over territory inside the
mine, but he did not elaborate.
   Robles said gas lamps set ablaze wooden tunnel supports on the
second level of the five-level mine Friday. That fire was
controlled, Robles said, but it flared again Saturday and heavy
smoke overwhelmed miners working inside.
   Lima's La Republica newspaper quoted police as saying the miners
started the fire themselves by setting the supports ablaze for
better lighting.
   Officials said it was not known exactly how many men were inside
the mine because the owners recently abandoned the operation, and
area residents, mainly farmers, have been working there for extra
cash.
   Robles said about 900 men work the mine with picks and shovels
and that each extracts up to a gram of gold a day, worth $10.
   Officials said rescuers on the scene lack technical expertise and
equipment. Mayor Li said air compressors were needed urgently to
clear the mine of fumes.
   Mining is Peru's most important industry and accounts for more
than half of its foreign exchange. Gold production averages about
$60 million yearly and is the nation's fifth leading mineral behind
copper, silver, lead and zinc.

   Joel Steinberg's lawyer unsuccessfully sought a
mistrial Tuesday after jurors asked if they could infer from
testimony about Steinberg beating his lover that he also beat the
child he is accused of killing.
   The jury deliberated for six hours Tuesday without reaching a
verdict.
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax had told the jurors
during the trial and during his instructions Monday that they could
not draw such an inference.
   On Tuesday he re-read his instruction that the evidence that
Steinberg beat Hedda Nussbaum was allowed only to show her state of
mind at the time and to explain why she did not get help for
6-year-old Lisa Steinberg.
   Defense lawyer Ira London, who had objected to the evidence as
irrelevant and inflammatory, asked for a mistrial, but was denied.
   ``I told you so,'' he said to reporters outside the courtroom.
   He said it was impossible to show jurors the videotape of Ms.
Nussbaum's injuries and her graphic testimony about beatings by
Steinberg without having the jury think the defendant had a
propensity for violence.
   Later in the day, London said Steinberg was encouraged by the
jurors seeking clarification on several points.
   ``For the first time during deliberations, he is feeling more
optimistic,'' London said of Steinberg.
   The jury also asked for and was shown three pieces of videotape
introduced during the trial.
   The tapes showed Ms. Nussbaum when she was booked on murder
charges, a policewoman showing the bruises on Ms. Nussbaum's body,
and Steinberg's knuckles, which a policeman testified were cut.
   Later, the jury provided a hint about its deliberations when it
asked Rothwax if it could consider lesser homicide counts against
Steinberg if it was not unanimous on the top count, second-degree
murder.
   Rothwax had made clear in his instructions that the jury could
consider manslaughter charges only if it was unanimous in acquitting
him of murder, and he repeated that Tuesday.
   The jurors' request seemed to indicate division on whether
Steinberg is guilty of murder.
   The jurors also asked to hear a definition of circumstantial
evidence; a re-reading of what is required to find someone guilty of
second-degree murder, first- and second-degree manslaughter and
criminally negligent homicide; and the meaning of reasonable doubt.
   Steinberg is charged in the death of Lisa, the girl he obtained
at birth from an unwed Long Island teen-ager and raised but never
legally adopted.
   The child was removed comatose from Steinberg's apartment on Nov.
2, 1987, and died of a brain injury three days later.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, a former children's book editor, was the
prosecution's star witness. She testified that Steinberg told her in
bed, after they free-based cocaine and while Lisa lay comatose on
their bathroom floor, that he had ``knocked Lisa down and she didn't
want to get up.''
   After 12 weeks of trial and 52 witnesses, the jury on Monday
received the case, which had sparked national debate about
responsibilities to report child abuse.
   On Monday, alternate jurors who were dismissed expressed mixed
views about Ms. Nussbaum's testimony. Some told reporters they
believed Ms. Nussbaum testified truthfully, others weren't sure and
some thought she was covering up.
   Dr. Samuel Klagsbrun, Ms. Nussbaum's psychiatrist, said Monday
his patient ``will interpret any verdict except murder as `They
didn't believe me.'
   ``If the jury shows any doubt she feels people will feel she is
responsible or somehow she participated in the crime, and that is a
hurt that she finds almost unbearable,'' he said.
   Steinberg's lawyers charge that Ms. Nussbaum fatally beat the
child in a jealous rage.
   The prosecution maintains that Ms. Nussbaum, whose murder charges
were dropped after she agreed to be a prosecution witness, was too
physically and emotionally disabled by 12 years of living with
Steinberg to have harmed Lisa.

   Dobson: Can you help me understand this desensitization process
that took place? What was going on in your mind?
   Bundy: About the desensitization, I would describe it in specific
terms is that each time I'd harm someone, each time I would kill
someone, there would be an enormous amount, especially at first, an
enormous amount of horror, guilt, remorse afterward, but then the
impulse to do it again would come back even stronger. Now, believe
me, I didn't ... The unique thing about how this worked, Dr. Dobson,
is I still felt in my regular life the full range of guilt and
remorse about other things.
   Dobson: But you had this compartmentalized.
   Bundy: This comparmentalized, very well focused, very sharply
focused area that was a black hole that was like a crack and
everything that fell into that crack hole just disappeared. Does
that make sense?
   Dobson: Yeah, it does. One of the final murders that you
committed, of course, was apparently little Kimberly Leach, 12 years
of age. I think the public outcry was greater there because an
innocent child was taken from a playground. What did you feel after
that? Was there normal emotions three days later? Where were you,
Ted?
   Bundy: I can't really talk about that.
   Dobson: That's too painful.
   Bundy: I would like to be able to convey what that experience is
like, but I can't be able to talk about it.
   Dobson: OK. ...
   Bundy: I can't begin to understand, I can try, but I'm aware that
I can't begin to understand the pain the parents of these children
... (inaudible) feel, and I can't restore really much to them, if
anything and I won't pretend to. And I don't even expect them to
forgive me and I am not asking for it. That kind of forgiveness is
of God. If they have it, they have it. If they don't maybe they'll
find it someday.
   Dobson: Do you deserve the punishment the state is inflicted upon
you?
   Bundy: That's a very good question and I'll answer it very
honestly. I don't want to die, I'm not going to kid you. I kid you
not. I deserve, certainly the most extreme punihsment society has
and I think society deserves to be protected from me and from others
like me, that's for sure. I think what I hope will come of our
discussion is I think society deserves to be protected from itself.
Because as we've been talking there are forces loose in this
country, particularly again this kind of violent pornography where
on the one hand well-meaning decent people will condemn the behavior
of a Ted Bundy while they're walking past a magazine rack full of
the very kinds of things that send kids down the road to be a Ted
Bundy.
   We're talking here not just about more, what I'm talking about is
going beyond retribution, which is what people want with me; going
beyond retribution and punishment because there is no way in the
world that killing me is going to restore those beautiful children
to their parents and correct and soothe the pain but I'll tell you
there are lots of other kids playing in streets around the country
today who are going to be dead tomorrow and the next day and the
next day and the next month because other young people are reading
the kinds of things and seeing the kinds of things that are
available when the media took over.
   Dobson: Ted, as you would imagine there is tremendous cynicism
about you on the outside and I suppose for good reason. I'm not sure
there is anything that you could say that people would believe, some
people would believe.
   Bundy: Yeah.
   Dobson: And yet you told me last night, and I have heard this
through our mutual friend (State Attorney) John Tanner, that you
have accepted the forgiveness of Jesus Christ, and are a follower
and believer in him. Do you draw strength from that in these final
hours?
   Bundy: I do. I can't say that ... being in the valley of shadow
of death is something that I've become all accustomed to and that I
am strong and there is nothing bothering me. Listen, it is no fun.
It gets kind of lonely, and yet I have to remind myself that every
one of us will go through this some day in one or another and
countless millions who have walked this Earth before us have. So,
this is just an experience which we all share, and here I am.

<HEAD>Manipulative Killer Once Rejected Plea Bargain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STARKE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Theodore Bundy, who was executed Tuesday for
the murder of a 12-year-old schoolgirl, once rejected a plea bargain
that would have imprisoned him for life.
   State Attorney Jerry Blair said at the time that Bundy ruined any
chance of avoiding the electric chair by trying to outwit the
prosecution.
   In May 1979, Bundy decided to admit his guilt in three Florida
killings on the condition that the prosecution would not recommend
the death penalty.
   Blair projected the guilty pleas would have produced a life
sentence with no chance of parole for at least 75 years.
   But plea bargaining broke down when Bundy tried unsuccessfully to
remove public defender Michael Minerva from the case, claiming he
was trying to coerce Bundy into admitting guilt, Blair said.
   He believed Bundy's bid to drop Minerva was part of a scheme to
have his guilty plea reversed on appeal.
   On Tuesday, state officials were poised to fend off one other
legal ploy that might have postponed the 7:06 a.m. execution.
   Gov. Bob Martinez appointed three psychiatrists to be at the
prison prior to the execution in case Bundy's attorney raised the
claim that he was mentally incompetent to be executed.
   Defense psychiatrist Dorothy Lewis of Yale University examined
him and found him competent to be executed.

   Ted Bundy's execution Tuesday ended an ordeal for
some families of his victims, while others found it hard to
comprehend that a moment they had sought for years had finally
arrived.
   ``Good,'' sighed Vivian Rancourt, mother of Bundy victim Susan
Rancourt, when reached at her LaConner home and told of Bundy's
early-morning execution at Starke, Fla.
   ``The only thing I can say is, thank God, it's finally over.''
   Eleanore Rose, whose daughter, Denise Naslund, was slain by
Bundy, was taken aback.
   ``I feel kind of numb in a way. My daughter's murderer was taken
care of. He paid for what he did,'' she said. ``It seems like I was
sentenced to a lifetime of waiting. Now there's really nothing to
wait for.''
   In Grand Junction, Colo., the father of a woman believed to have
been murdered by Bundy said he was relieved, although investigators
said Bundy did not confess to the slaying.
   ``We're just happy he's been executed because it should have
happened a long time ago,'' said Robert Nicholson, father of Denise
Oliverson.
   ``It's been a nightmare for 14 years and he's devastated too many
families and manipulated the justice system into a three-ring
circus,'' Nicholson said.
   In his final hours, Bundy, 42, called his mother, Louise Bundy,
twice at her Tacoma home.
   ``He kept saying how sorry he was, that `there was another part
of me that people didn't know,''' she said afterward, adding that he
sounded ``very much at peace with himself.''
   At the conclusion of the second call, she told him: ``You'll
always be my precious son.''
   In the days before his death, Bundy ended years of proclaiming
his innocence and admitted finally to 20 deaths in Western states,
including 11 in Washington.
   He did not own up to the crime he was killed for, the 1978 rape
and murder of a 12-year-old Lake City, Fla., girl, nor to the
bludgeoning deaths that year of two Florida State University
sorority sisters, for which he also was convicted.
   His death left more questions still for some.
   Beverly and Donald Burr, whose 8-year-old daughter, Ann Marie,
disappeared from a Tacoma home near Bundy's nearly 30 years ago, had
hoped Bundy could have shed light on their mystery. Bundy was 14
when the girl disappeared Aug. 31, 1961.
   But Bundy denied killing the girl, said Robert Keppel, a
Washington attorney general's investigator to whom Bundy confessed
the 11 Washington killings.
   Belva Kent, of Bountiful, Utah, said that although she had not
been told if Bundy admitted responsibility for her daughter's
disappearance in the mid-1970s, ``I'm glad it's over, and that's
about all.''
   The mother of Shelley Robertson, 24, of Denver, who disappeared
June 30, 1975, said she remains opposed to the death penalty.
   ``Killing Ted Bundy won't make me feel better and it won't bring
back Shelley,'' Roberta Robertson said. ``A lot of people seem to
want it out of a vengeance. But, it gives people a false sense of
security and it's terribly expensive.''
   A psychiatrist who examined Bundy as part of a last-ditch attempt
to save him from execution concluded he suffered from a
manic-depressive illness and that his mental problems likely started
when he was an infant.
   Dr. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a New Haven, Conn., psychiatrist,
interviewed Bundy on Monday. She determined Bundy suffered from a
manic-depressive illness that produced violent mood swings. At a
moment's notice, Bundy could switch from euphoria and compulsive
talking to anger followed by long periods of sullen silence, she
said.
   She said Bundy may have had a genetic predisposition to mental
illness. Lewis said Bundy's maternal grandfather would kick dogs,
swing cats by their tails and beat people who angered him. She said
Bundy's maternal grandmother had been hospitalized more than once
for psychotic depression and had undergone electroshock therapy.
   Bundy exhibited bizarre behavior at his grandparents' house, the
psychiatrist said. At age 3, he appeared several times at the
bedside of his 15-year-old aunt, lifting the covers and placing
butcher knives beside her.
   In Denver, a former public defender who represented Bundy when he
was charged in a killing at Aspen, Colo., said he had mixed feelings.
   ``As much as I disliked Ted and thought he was a dangerous
individual, I have mixed feelings,'' said attorney Chuck Leidner.
``I do think the justice system stinks. If Ted Bundy had been black
or Hispanic and poor and unattractive, he would have been killed
long ago. He drew support because he was white, middle class and
well-educated.''
   Mrs. Rancourt said hearing that Bundy was dead brought relief.
   ``I'm hoping that this will never be allowed to happen again.
This terrible wait,'' she said. ``We won't have to hear any more
stories of how he played the system or his escapades.''
   For Ms. Rose, ``It's like I can't believe that I'm here alive and
he's dead. He's been such a part of my life and existence,'' she
said, choking back tears.
   ``I don't know what it's gonna be like not to run to the radio
and TV and taping this and that and waiting on appeals and being
disgusted with the judicial system. I feel like, `What am I going to
be doing?'
   But she added: ``I'm glad he's dead.''

<HEAD>American Accused Of Drug Trafficking Hospitalized After Heart Attack</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Hull, an American jailed on
charges of drug trafficking, suffered a heart attack Tuesday and was
transferred to a local hospital, officials said.
   Hull, a longtime resident of Costa Rica, is a well-known
supporter of the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels. Costa Rican
authorities arrested Hull, 69, two weeks ago on charges of drug
trafficking and violating Costa Rican security.
   Hull was later formally charged by the 4th District Court. He was
awaiting a court hearing when he suffered a heart attack in San
Sebastian Jail early Tuesday.
   Hospital director Matias Quezada told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview that Hull was temporarily transferred to the
hospital's intensive care unit after losing consciousness, but later
was returned to a regular hospital room.
   Quezada said Hull was to remain in the hospital for at least 48
hours for observation.
   The hospital director said Hull was handcuffed to his bed, but he
said he would ask authorities to remove the cuffs for fear Hull
would suffer another atttack.
   Hull's lawyer, Elda Zuniga, said in a telephone interview that
4th District Court Judge Laovigildo Rodriguez on Tuesday denied her
appeal for Hull's release.
   ``It's a clear case of political persecution, but I am going to
appeal again until Hull is released on bail,'' Ms. Zuniga said.
   She said Hull is not guilty of the charges and that his arrest
was unconstitutional.
   Ms. Zuniga said her client is charged under a drug law passed in
1987 and that the law is not retroactive. Hull is charged of acts
that allegedly occurred in 1984, she said.
   Sources in the Office of Judicial Investigations have said Hull
was arrested for investigation into charges of drug and weapons
trafficking and spying for the anti-Sandinista Nicaraguan rebels
known as Contras.
   The Office of Judicial Investigation sources said they acted
after residents near his farm in Los Chiles, on the Nicaraguan
border, denounced activities by Hull. The acts were seen as possibly
endangering relations between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the sources
said on condition of anonymity.
   Witnesses testifying before Congress on illegal arms shipments to
the Contras have said Hull's ranch was a way station for gun
smugglers and cocaine traffickers.
   Hull was not among 13 men indicted in September in Miami on
charges of running an illegal arms network for the Contras. Reports
said Hull was granted immunity by the special prosecutor in the case.
   Convicted cocaine pilot Gary Betzner has testified that Hull once
met his plane when it landed on the ranch to exchange Contra arms
for Colombian cocaine.
   Hull has strongly denied any connection to drug trafficking.
   Hull also was among 29 people named in a civil suit filed last
year by two journalists involving a 1984 bombing in Nicaragua that
killed eight people.
   Tony Avirgan filed the suit with his wife, Martha Honey, after
being wounded in the bombing.
   A U.S. district judge in Miami ruled in favor of the defendants,
saying the plaintiffs failed to prove their basic contention that a
wide-ranging conspiracy was behind the bombing.
   The apparent target of the bombing, Contra leader Eden Pastora,
was wounded.

<TEXT>
   Three Israeli-allied Lebanese militiamen
were killed Tuesday when a bomb went off under their vehicle as they
patrolled Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon,
police said.
   Four militiamen in the American-made armored personal carrier of
the South Lebanon Army were wounded in the midday attack near the
village of Kantara, 16 miles east of the southern port of Tyre.
   Police said the SLA retaliated by shelling nearby Kabrikha
village with mortars and artillery for two hours.
   The site is just north of the area of operations of the Irish
battalion of the U.N peacekeeping force in south Lebanon.
   ``Irish troops were seen evacuating nearly 50 pupils trapped in
the shelled village school,'' a police spokesman said on condition
of anonymity.
   U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel said an Irish private was wounded in
the left arm by shrapnel from an SLA mortar blast while in his
sandbagged position 17 miles east of Tyre. He was not identified.
   Israel created the security zone, a six-to-10 mile-wide buffer
strip along the border, when it withdrew most of its troops from
Lebanon in 1985, ending a three-year occupation.
   The strip, a target of frequent attacks by extremist Moslem and
leftist militiamen and Palestinian guerrillas, is patrolled by about
1,000 Israeli soldiers and more than 2,000 SLA militiamen, who are
trained and financed by Israel.

<TEXT>
   A poaching ring that involved the
slaughter of more than 400 black bears in the Northeast was broken
Tuesday with the arrests of 11 people, officials said.
   Officials said the bears were killed for their gall bladders,
which are prized as aphrodisiacs in the Far East.
   ``This is just the tip of this particular iceberg,'' said Walter
Bickford, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Fisheries,
Wildlife and Environmental Law Enforcement. ``We're aware of
numerous other operations like this in Massachusetts.''
   The arrests were made in raids that began at 6 a.m. in
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Florida, wildlife
officials announced at a news conference.
   The raids were the culmination of a 2{-year investigation that
``tracked approximately $50,000 in transactions involving everything
from endangered species to black bear gall bladders,'' officials
said. Game officials from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service participated in the sting.
   Dozens of pelts, including those of a mountain lion and several
bobcats, and gall bladders confiscated in the raids were displayed
at the news conference.
   The officials also showed photographs of 27 bear carcasses piled
in a meadow in the Catskills.
   The hides sold illegally in the course of the investigation
included those of two tigers, two polar bears and one arctic fox,
officials said.
   Bickford said investigators bought at least 360 gall bladders in
addition to carcasses and skins.
   The arresting officers also confiscated boxes of pills that were
said to contain small amounts of rhinoceros horn, also considered an
aphrodisiac.
   ``This is a primitive superstition,'' said Bickford. ``There is
no proof whatsoever to the claim'' involving either the bear organs
or rhinoceros horns, he said.
   Dried, powdered black bear gall bladders have a greater street
value in the Far East than heroin or cocaine does in the United
States, Bickford said. The organs can sell for $540 an ounce or more.
   Three of the arrested suspects were from Massachusetts, three
were from Connecticut, four from New Hampshire and one was arrested
in Florida. Wildlife officials said more arrests were expected in
New York and an undetermined number of suspects in other states were
still at large.
   The arrested suspects together face more than 100 counts in their
states, ranging from illegal hunting to practicing taxidermy without
a license. Penalties for each count range up to one year in prison
and $1,000 in fines.

<TEXT>
   A 375-pound former professional wrestler
who said he strangled a 105-pound woman after she savagely bit him
during rough sex pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of manslaughter
Tuesday.
   Larry Finnegan Jr., 28, of Greenwich, whose ring name was
``Crusher,'' was originally charged with murder in the death last
June of Hazel Koppel, 20, a homeless woman whom Finnegan said he
paid to have sex with him.
   Under the plea agreement, Finnegan will be sentenced to 18 years
in prison, to be suspended after he serves 12. He is scheduled to be
sentenced March 15.
   The prosecution conceded in Superior Court that Finnegan's
version of how Koppel died was plausible, given the substantial bite
wound he suffered.
   ``We had the visible effects of a bite mark on his left breast
that was placed there by the victim for whatever reason,'' Assistant
State's Attorney Bruce Hudock said.
   ``We have to give some credibility to the story given by the
defendant that he was just enraged that she would not let go of his
chest area,'' Hudock said. ``I concluded the jury would most likely
find him guilty of manslaughter.''
   Finnegan, who was working as a truck driver for a moving company,
picked up Koppel in Stamford early June 6, 1988, and was having sex
with her in the cab of his truck when he killed her, according to
his attorney, Michael Sherman of Stamford.
   He walked into Stamford police headquarters that morning and told
authorities that her body could be found in his parked truck.

   A jury on Tuesday ordered the death penalty
for a man convicted of kidnapping an off-duty police officer from
his apartment and shooting him to death.
   The jury deliberated two hours before delivering the sentence
against Samuel Lee Green, who was convicted late Monday of
first-degree murder, kidnapping and conspiracy.
   The prosecution contended that Green kidnapped and killed Richard
Bowser after the off-duty Harrisburg police officer awoke during a
burglary at his home on Oct. 22, 1987.
   Green and Bonnie Sue Pflugler, who will be tried in February,
were arrested in Florida a week after the murder while sleeping in
the back of a van stolen in North Carolina.
   First Assistant District Attorney Mark Refowich, who argued for
the death penalty, said he was pleased.
   ``It was a statement by the jurors ... that they are sick and
tired of this kind of senseless killing,'' he said.
   Green, 33, of Harrisburg, did not testify during the trial and
would not allow his two lawyers to argue on his behalf during the
sentencing phase, said his attorney, Ronold Karasek.
   Karasek said Green was probably upset and frustrated with the
first-degree verdict. Green will appeal the case, he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Defeats Canadian In Third Game of Candidates Quarterfinal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Soviet Grandmaster Artur Yusupov defeated
Kevin Spraggett of Canada in the third game of their World Chess
Championship Candidates quarterfinal Tuesday to tie the score at 1.5
points each.
   In a endgame characterized by subtle maneuvering, Yusupov,
playing white, boxed in the Canadian player's King.
   Faced with a checkmate, Spraggett resigned while pondering his
42nd move.
   Spraggett seized the lead with a brilliant victory in the second
game on Sunday, fueling Canadian hopes that the 34-year-old from
Montreal, who ranked 35th in the world, might become the first North
American since Bobby Fischer to reach the semifinal stage of the
competition.
   While Yusupov, 28, regained a psychological edge, most experts
say the outcome of the contest is difficult to predict.
   ``In such a short match with only three games left, just about
anything can happen,'' said Leontxo Garcia, a Spanish chess
commentator.
   The winner of the six-game duel will receive five-eighths of the
$32,500 prize fund. The winner of the Candidates series will
challenge Garri Kasparov of the Soviet Union for his world
championship crown in a 1990 title bout.
   The fourth game is scheduled for Wednesday with Spraggett playing
with the advantage of the white pieces. Of the three remaining
games, Spraggett has two games with white, Yusupov only one.
   If the contest ends tied at 3-3, two more games will be played,
followed by sudden-death tiebreakers at increasingly high speeds.
   A win scores one point and a draw a half.
   British Grandmaster Jonathan Speelman, who won quarterfinals in
August, is the only player so far who has made it to the semifinals.
   The third quarterfinal, between former world champion Anatoly
Karpov and Johann Hjartarson of Iceland, begins Saturday in Seattle.
   The fourth quarterfnal, between Dutch Grandmaster Jan Timman and
Lajos Portisch of Hungary, begins Jan. 31 in Antwerp, Belgium.

   Ted Bundy, a charming law school dropout who
ended years of denials that he was a killer with emotional
confessions to the gruesome slayings of 23 women in four states, was
electrocuted Tuesday for murdering a 12-year-old girl.
   Bundy's last words, before a black-hooded executioner pulled a
switch at 7:06 a.m. sending 2,000 volts through his body, were to
his lawyer and a minister: ``Give my love to my family and friends.''
   More than 100 proponents of the death penalty waiting in a field
across from the Florida State Prison cheered, lit sparklers and set
off firecrackers at the signal that 42-year-old Theodore Robert
Bundy had finally been put to death for a crime committed almost 11
years ago. Three earlier execution dates were stymied by appeals.
   ``Burn, Bundy, burn!'' some shouted. A group of about a dozen
people parodied an old tune by singing ``On top of old Sparky'' _ a
reference to the nickname for Florida's oaken, three-legged electric
chair.
   Only about two dozen people opposed to the death penalty turned
up to keep a vigil in the field.
   ``The people of Florida today administered justice,'' Gov. Bob
Martinez said 1{ hours after the execution. ``If there's ever been
anyone on Florida's death row that deserved the electric chair, Ted
Bundy was that individual.''
   Bundy had been quick-witted, known for his cockiness and
arrogance, a handsome, blue-eyed charmer. He was the subject of five
books and a television miniseries, ``The Deliberate Stranger.''
   But he recently claimed to ``feel God's presence,'' and was
reported at the end to be remorseful about his bloody trail of
kidnappings, sadistic sexual mutilations and slayings in his home
state of Washington, and in Utah, Colorado, Idaho and Florida.
   In an interview with religious broadcaster and psychologist James
Dobson hours before his execution, Bundy said his home life had been
normal, but early experiences with pornography had ``crystallized''
violent tendencies within him. Later, alcohol reduced his
inhibitions and he acted on those tendencies, he said.
   ``The most damaging kinds of pornography _ and again here I'm
talking from personal experience, hard, real personal experience _
are those that involve violence, and sexual violence,'' Bundy said.
He then issued a warning:
   ``There is loose in their towns, their communities, people like
me today, whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in and day
out by violence in the media in its various forms, particularly
sexual violence,'' Bundy said.
   In the last days of his life, Bundy slowly, deliberately
described his crimes in detail, said Russ Reneau, chief investigator
for Idaho Attorney General Jim Jones. Reneau said Bundy told how he
made an overnight trip from Salt Lake City to Pocatello, Idaho. ``He
said he was here for a specific purpose, and that was to commit a
murder,'' he said.
   But when asked why he killed, Reneau said Bundy answered ``only
obliquely. When we asked him why he made that trip (to Pocatello) he
said it was because of `the madness.' He did not elaborate on that.''
   His execution, for the murder of sixth-grader Kimberly Diane
Leach of Lake City, made him the 20th man put to death in Florida
and the 106th in the United States since the U.S. Supreme Court
allowed states to reinstate the death penalty in 1976.
   Kimberly was kidnapped from the grounds of her junior high school
Feb. 9, 1978, just three weeks after the killings of two women at
Chi Omega sorority at Florida State University. The child's body was
found three months later in an abandoned pigsty. Bundy was also
under a death sentence for the two Chi Omega murders.
   Until near the end he had insisted he was innocent, although he
had been suspected of as many as 36 killings and disappearances.
Then late last week he began talking to investigators from the four
Western states, closing the books on unsolved crimes, including some
in which he had not been a suspect.
   The number of confessions was originally put at 20, but Robert
Keppel, a Washington state attorney general's investigator, said
Tuesday that Bundy also admitted to killing a young hitchhiker near
Olympia in 1973 and two other women in Washington whom Bundy did not
identify, give times of death or say where the bodies were left.
   Shortly after the execution, Vivian Rancourt of LaConner, Wash.,,
mother of Bundy victim Susan Rancourt, sighed, ``Good. ...The only
thing I can say is thank God, it's finally over.''
   One of Bundy's final acts was to permit James Dobson, a
California psychologist and host of a syndicated radio show, to
videotape an interview to be broadcast later. Dobson described Bundy
as ``feeling great remorse.'' He quoted Bundy saying his crimes
``should serve as a warning to the dangers of pornography.''
   Bundy appeared frightened when he was escorted into the death
chamber. But he moved easily to the chair, nodding to his attorney,
James Coleman, and Gainesville minister Fred Lawrence, who had
counseled him earlier.
   ``Jim and Fred, I'd like you to give my love to my family and
friends,'' he said in a strong voice that trailed off at the end.
   ``He was calm but visibly shaken,'' said state Rep. Randy Mackey
of Lake City, an official witness.
   Bundy stared straight ahead and his jaw tightened when workers
adjusted a chin strap and fitted a hood over his shaven head. When
the switch was thrown by the anonymous executioner, who is paid $150
for the job, Bundy's body surged back against the chair. His fists
clenched.
   A doctor pronounced him dead at 7:16 a.m. EST.
   Gene Williams, owner of the Williams-Thomas Funeral Home, said he
accepted custody of the body but would not give any details on
arrangements, including whether there would be burial or cremation.
But he said no funeral was planned.
   ``Eleven years is too long,'' said Mackey, referring to legal
maneuvers that kept the execution in doubt virtually until the last
minute.
   The execution came a week to the day after the U.S. Supreme Court
denied an appeal in the Leach case. The days following were filled
with a round of appeals by Bundy lawyers. The U.S. Supreme Court
voted 5-4 late Monday against another stay.
   John Tanner, a prosecutor who arranged for Bundy's confessions
with investigators from the four Western states, said Bundy had not
finished ``telling the names and locations of bodies. He just ran
out of time.''
   The governor had insisted that Bundy would not be allowed to use
a protracted litany of confessions to delay his execution a fourth
time.
   ``You don't negotiate with a killer,'' said Martinez, adding that
Bundy had had plenty of time in which to talk if he had wanted to.
   Conspicuously absent among the detectives, lawyers, friends and
advisers visiting Bundy in prison was the woman he married during
the Leach trial in Orlando in 1980 _ the former Carole Boone.
   She often visited Bundy, but prison records do not list a visit
for the past two years. However, her son from a previous marriage,
James, now in his 20s, visited Sunday.
   Among the official witnesses was Kenneth Robinson, a Highway
Patrol trooper who found the girl's body.
   ``I thought back and I felt like justice has been done,''
Robinson said. ``But I wonder if he went through as much suffering
as she did.''

   A United Nations envoy on Tuesday sought
to get Iran-Iraq peace talks moving again by meeting with Iranian
leaders in Tehran. Another planeload of Iranian POWs arrived from
Iraq.
   The 124 ailing and disabled Iranian prisoners of war were
released unilaterally by Baghdad in what Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein called a ``humanitarian gesture'' and was the second group
to be repatriated in as many days.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Jan Eliasson, special
envoy for U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez De Cuellar, met with
deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hussein Lavasani and discussed ways
to end the impasse.
   Iran and Iraq ended eight years of fighting Aug. 20 under a U.N.
Security Council cease-fire resolution.
   The resolution calls on the nations to halt ``all military
activities,'' withdraw troops to pre-war borders, exchange about
100,000 prisoners of war and start peace talks.
   Iraq occupies 259 square miles of Iranian territory. Baghdad says
it will not pull out unless Iran gives up its right under
international law _ until a peace treaty is signed _ to search ships
in the Persian Gulf for Iraq-bound war cargo.
   Iran has not stopped Iraqi ships since the cease-fire, and
insists that troop withdrawals must come next in the peace process.
   Tehran radio said ``Eliasson's trip is primarily for setting a
date for the resumption of the peace talks.'' Iran, however, will
not resume negotiations without a guarantee there will be progress,
according to the report.
   The peace talks became snarled almost as soon as they began five
days after the cease-fire took effect. Three rounds of negotiations
since then have failed to break the deadlock.
   ``The secretary general is determined that the various points of
the resolution be implemented as soon as possible,'' Tehran
television quoted Eliasson as saying on his arrival Monday night.
   The television, monitored in Nicosia, reported Eliasson as saying
he also plans to inspect the Iran-Iraq border during his visit.
   Eliasson, also Sweden's U.N. ambassador, is due in Baghdad Friday.
   If there is no progress in future talks, Perez de Cuellar still
would be bound by the U.N. Security Council to carry out provisions
of the cease-fire resolution, Tehran radio said.
   Tehran's Kayhan daily Monday called for ``punitive measures'' to
ensure progress and suggested a deadline be set for implementing the
resolution, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The official agency, monitored in Nicosia, reported the newspaper
as saying such measures should include a ``political and economic
international boycott'' of Iraq, ``which can easily force Baghdad to
adopt a reasonable attitude towards the talks.''
   Baghdad's Ath-Thawra daily Tuesday said Iraq wants a
``comprehensive implementation of the resolution in sequential
order.''
   Tuesday's return of Iranian prisoners of war followed the release
of 131 on Monday. Both groups were flown to Tehran in an airliner
chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   There was no indication Tehran would respond to the Iraqi moves,
the first prisoner releases since a Red Cross-sponsored exchange
broke down Nov. 27 because of a dispute over the number of prisoners
to be freed.
   Before the exchange was halted, 155 Iraqis and 56 Iranians were
freed.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi prisoners held by Iran
and 19,284 Iranians by Iraq. The United Nations and other officials
say the nations together could hold as many as 100,000 prisoners.

   An airline pilot misunderstood an air traffic
controller who told him ``you've lost the engine,'' not realizing it
had actually fallen off the plane until he landed safely, cockpit
conversations revealed Tuesday.
   The pilot of Piedmont Airlines Flight 1480 apparently believed
his engine had only shut down, even after he successfully returned
the plane with 27 passengers aboard to O'Hare International Airport,
just two minutes after takeoff last Friday.
   ``I understand the right engine is shut down,'' the pilot said,
sounding slightly dazed and out of breath shortly after landing,
according to the transcript released by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   A few minutes later, the pilot told the tower: ``Hey ground
tower, whoever I'm talking to, this is Piedmont out here on the
runway. We've lost the engine. I don't know whatever happened to
it.''
   The control tower responded: ``It fell off the aircraft about a
half-mile past the end of the runway.''
   No one was injured in the incident. The passengers on the Boeing
737-200 were put on other flights to Charlotte N.C., their initial
destination.
   ``The pilot was calm,'' said FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein. ``I
wonder how he would have felt if he'd known. I thought he did a
magnificent job.''
   The control tower knew less than a minute after the plane
departed that it had lost its right engine, according to the
transcript of the conversation with the pilot:
   Tower: ``Piedmont 1480, it looks like you've lost the engine. Can
you make a right turn back for 32 right'' _ a designation for a
runway.
   Pilot: ``We've got to come back to a runway.''
   Tower: ``A left turn. A left turn. You lost the engine. You lost
the engine.
   ``1480 _ any runway, any runway. There is no traffic. (You're)
cleared to land any runway.''
   After it landed, the plane was losing fuel as it sat on the
runway. Fire trucks were called and passengers were taken from the
plane in a bus, Edelstein said.
   ``I need the fire department to come out here to take a look at
this thing. I understand there's some fuel coming out,'' the pilot
said.
   Piedmont spokesman David Shipley said the names of pilot and
co-pilot will not be released.
   The engine, which fell into a field at O'Hare, is being examined
at the airport and some parts have been sent to Washington, the
National Transportation Safety Board has said.

   Here is an edited transcript of the conversation
between the control tower at O'Hare International Airport and the
pilot of Piedmont Airlines Flight 1480, which lost an engine shortly
after takeoff but landed safely Friday. The transcript was provided
by the Federal Aviation Administration.
   `C' stands for control tower and `P' for the Piedmont pilot. The
FAA deleted conversation from other pilots who saw the jet lose its
engine.
   The transcript begins with the tower telling the Piedmont flight
to get ready for takeoff on runway 27L while another jet lands on
runway 32L. After the plane has taken off, the conversation
continues:
   C: Piedmont 1480 it looks like you've lost the engine. Can you
make a right turn back for 32R?
   P: We've got to come back to a runway.
   C: A left turn, a left turn. You lost the engine. You lost the
engine.
   C: 1480 any runway, any runway. The wind is 350 at 20. You're on
a good left base.
   P: A good left base we got it.
   C: You can go 4R if you want; that's a left 90 degree turn.
   P: Roger.
   C: 1480 wind is 350 at 20; there is no traffic for you. Cleared
to land any runway.
   P: Roger, we got you.
   The control tower then asks whether the pilot plans to evacuate
the aircraft.
   P: We're going to park it right here. I need somebody to tow,
we've lost the A pump, too.
   The tower asks again if the pilot plans to evacuate.
   P: Ahh, let's see. I don't need to do that right now. I need the
fire department to come out here to take a look at this thing. I
understand there's some fuel coming out. I've lost the A pump and I
lost the ... There's fuel coming. ... I understand the right engine
is shut down. The right engine is shut down. Well, I tell you what,
how about having somebody come out here and tow us. We don't have
any steering. We can't taxi.
   C: I understand sir, the fire equipment is on the way. We will
have someone come out and tow you. I understand you will not egress
(evacuate) the aircraft. We'll pass that along to the fire
department and I'll keep you advised on this frequency.
   C: Piedmont 1480, some of the folks off the left side said you're
still dumping fuel all over the place down there.
   P: Yeah, I don't doubt it. I've got the fuel pumps off and
everything so the T-handle has been pulled and I don't know if
there's anything that can be done about it.
   P: Hey ground tower, whoever I'm talking to, this is Piedmont out
here on the runway. We've lost the engine. I don't know whatever
happened to it.
   C: It fell off the aircraft about a half a mile past the end of
the runway.
   The control tower then gives the pilot another radio frequency.
   C: ... The city has requested that you egress the aircraft to the
left side of the aircraft because of the fuel. That is the city
request.
   P: Yea, that's what we're going to do. I just wanted to get some
stairs out here. Yea everything's shut down. There should be no fire
danger.

<HEAD>Ex-Premier Plans To Challenge Iran Hierarchy In Political Comeback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Iranian Prime Minister Mehdi
Bazargan says he plans to build his tiny opposition party into a
national movement to challenge Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
hierarchy, Iran's official news agency reported Tuesday.
   In his first interview in seven years, Bazargan told the Tehran
Times newspaper that his Freedom Movement will field a candidate in
August's presidential election ``if political conditions ... are
favorable,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Giving a public platform to Bazargan, the first prime minister of
the Islamic republic after the 1979 revolution, underlined moves by
Iranian leaders to ease political restrictions after the August
cease-fire in the eight-year war with Iraq.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said in a separate report that
Khomeini's designated successor, Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri,
told Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi Tuesday there must be
``no delays'' in implementing a new law permitting opposition
parties.
   ``With ... the new law, the people will really feel that they
have a bigger role in the decision-making process and will see
themselves in the center of the revolution and partners in it,''
Montazeri said.
   IRNA quoted Bazargan as telling the English-language newspaper:
``We will organize the party at all levels throughout the country so
that we can present our plans to the people ... who will give their
verdict.
   ``If that verdict is in our favor, we will naturally have the
right to form a government,'' the 81-year-old political veteran,
said in the interview, which was also reprinted by Farsi-language
dailies.
   His moderate Freedom Movement, which frequently demanded that
Khomeini end the war, is one of 28 groups that have applied to
register as political parties.
   The government announced Dec. 31 it will allow political
organizations provided they do not conspire against the state.
   Since Khomeini abolished the ruling Islamic Republic Party two
years ago as unnecessary, the Freedom Movement has been the only
recognized opposition faction in Iran. The rest were systematically
eliminated in bloody purges in 1981.
   There are no official parties within the hierarchy, but factions
that revolve around leading figures operate like parties.
   Khomeini's regime apparently hopes that giving moderate opponents
a voice will isolate more extremist factions. But the new political
framework will be tightly controlled, and many Iranians are
skeptical about how effective it will be.
   There are indications that any new parties may be approved in
time to take part in planned summer elections for rural, city and
provincial legislative councils totaling 300,000 seats.
   Khomeini named Bazargan, a French-educated engineer who was
jailed by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, prime minister Feb.23, 1979, a
few days after the revolutionaries took power.
   But Bazargan's moderate policies, seeking gradual social and
economic reforms rather than the radical extremes of the
revolutionaries, ran foul of the fundamentalists.
   Accused by his opponents of being pro-American, he resigned two
days after militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4,
1979.

<HEAD>Adams Wins Expedited Parole Review</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT ROTHSCHILD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state board Tuesday granted an expedited
parole review to the man whose conviction in the 1976 fatal shooting
of a Dallas policeman was questioned in the film ``The Thin Blue
Line.''
   Randall Dale Adams, 40, who is serving a life sentence, has been
denied parole eight times, most recently on Jan. 10, according to
state records.
   His next parole review was scheduled for December, but under
Tuesday's action, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles will
consider Adams' appeal for parole soon, said Glenn T. Heckmann, the
board's executive director.
   ``I would speculate it would be within the next 30 days. Normally
decisions (about whether to grant parole) are made shortly after
review,'' he said.
   The board expedited Adams' parole request based on information
provided by State District Judge Larry Baraka, said Karen Armstrong,
an information officer with the board.
   In a hearing last month, Baraka ruled Adams did not receive a
fair trial in 1977 and recommended he be granted a new one or set
free.
   During the December hearing, the key witness against Adams
changed his story and testified that Adams didn't commit the murder
and wasn't even in the car police officer Robert Wood stopped just
before he was gunned down. But David Ray Harris, now on Death Row
for another killing, stopped short of saying he pulled the trigger
himself in Wood's slaying.
   Adams has maintained his innocence and contends prosecutors
wanted to convict him rather than Harris, who was only 16 at the
time, because, if convicted as a juvenile, Harris would have been
released at age 18.
   The case was the subject of Errol Morris' documentary movie ``The
Thin Blue Line,'' which questioned Adams' guilt.
   Adams has served more than 12 years in state prison. In 1980, his
death sentence was commuted to life.
   Baraka's recommendation that Adams be given a new trial or set
free is before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which could take
as long as two years to act on it, attorneys say.
   Earlier, Baraka had said he would write to the six-member board
asking that Adams be granted parole.
   ``Listening to the evidence, there's reasonable evidence to
believe the man's not guilty or didn't get a fair trial,'' Baraka
said.

   Armed civilians surrendered to the
army Tuesday after a one-day assault on an infantry base in which at
least 36 people were killed and scores wounded, the government said.
   ``Anyone there participated in a shocking spectacle,'' President
Raul Alfonsin said after visiting the camp. ``It was a nightmare.
Death. Once again, death. Brutality. Barbarism.''
   Alfonsin said the commandos were ``ultra-leftists,'' citing
documents seized by soldiers after the camp was recaptured. He said
fighting political subversion is ``the last test of my government.''
   ``This is my fight and I'll fight it to the finish so society is
free of this aggression,'' a somber Alfonsin said at Government
House in a 12-minute address to the Cabinet, military chiefs and a
nationwide broadcast audience.
   ``Society won't tolerate more violence, from whatever side,'' he
said.
   Alfonsin, who also has had to cope with three insurrections by
rightist army officers in the past 21 months, said he would form a
National Security Council to advise him on anti-subversion strategy.
He did not elaborate.
   Alfonsin said 28 commandos were killed and 14 captured alive as
government forces recaptured the 3rd Infantry Regiment base in La
Tablada on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, which the commandos
attacked Monday morning.
   Seven soldiers and one policeman were killed, and 67 soldiers and
policemen were wounded. Four civilians were wounded.
   Troopers on Tuesday tracked down snipers and searched bunkers at
the camp. Captured weapons included sophisticated machine guns from
the Soviet Union and China, military officials said.
   Alfonsin toured the base in the afternoon, looking closely at the
charred bodies and buildings blasted by tanks and mortars. Soldiers
were still exchanging gunfire with snipers in mopping-up operations,
but no fire was aimed at Alfonsin or his helicopter.
   As dusk approached, small fires still smoldered in gutted brick
buildings. Half a dozen buildings were in ruins, their windows blown
out and tile roofs collapsed or burned away.
   Helicopter gunships clattered over the base and a seedy sprawl of
project houses across the highway.
   Military and government officials said the attackers apparently
intended to steal weapons from the camp armory.
   Reporters counted 15 bodies, five blackened or mutilated by
explosions or fire. At least one was a soldier and two were women.
   The identities and motive of the attackers were not known. Army
officers said some were foreigners, the government news agency Telam
reported without elaboration.
   ``Surely, the objective was to take weapons and flee, but the
rapid action of the ... police and the armed forces ... made flight
something they could not achieve,'' said Antonio Berhongaray,
chairman of the Senate Defense Committee and member of Alfonsin's
Radical Civic Union party.
   Cesar Jaroslavsky, Radical Civic Union leader in the House of
Deputies, said at least some in the raiders belonged to the People's
Revolutionary Army, a leftist guerrilla group active in the 1970s.
   Confiscated pamphlets indicated the attackers called themselves
the ``Popular Resistance Front,'' said Jose Ignacio Lopez,
presidential press secretary. He said other pamphlets indicated the
group felt a military coup was imminent and wanted to prevent it.
   Gen. Walter Jurado, the Buenos Aires police chief, said the
captured attackers are believed linked to the leftist People's
Revolutionary Army.
   The assault began about 6:30 a.m. Monday. Shooting continued more
than 27 hours later, when 13 men and a woman with their arms raised
in surrender emerged from the shell of a building that had been
blasted by tanks the day before.
   All reports indicated four of the 14 were soldiers who had been
held captive.
   Graciela Marino, a resident of the working-class neighborhood
around the base, said ``bombs and shooting'' awakened the
neighborhood Monday morning and had continued since.
   The suddenness and ferocity of the attack caught the government
and armed forces off guard, which could cause problems for
Alfonsin's party in elections scheduled for May 14.
   ``This isn't the best moment to start attributing blame, but it
surprises us that an operation of this size was not detected by the
intelligence services, even though we're dealing with commando
groups that are very well organized,'' said Sen. Eduardo Menem of
the opposition Peronist Party.
   Alfonsin's elected civilian government took office in 1983 after
nearly eight years of military rule.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Henry Cisneros reaffirmed Tuesday his
decision not seek a fifth term after key supporters said they would
back the campaign of his opponent even if he sought re-election.
   In a statement released by his office, Cisneros said he
appreciated the encouragement of some supporters, but was standing
by his September announcement that he would not seek re-election in
order to devote time to straightening out personal matters.
   The 41-year-old mayor had said Sunday that he might reconsider
his decision, but said he would first speak with former Mayor Lila
Cockrell, who is running again, after he returned from speaking
engagements in Massachusetts.
   He was scheduled to return Tuesday afternoon, but missed a flight
and relied on his office to deliver the statement.
   ``In September, I said I would not seek re-election,'' Cisneros
said in the statement. ``When I made that declaration I, in effect,
gave my word. I stand by it. My name will not be on the city
election ballot in May.''
   When he announced last September that he would not seek office,
Mrs. Cockrell said she would enter the race. She already has raised
about $40,000 and has commitments from Cisneros supporters.
   ``Certainly the part that I least desired was the role that I
think I would have had to run against a good friend, but I would
have felt a responsibility to remain in the race,'' Mrs. Cockrell
said after hearing of Cisneros' decision Tuesday.
   Cisneros had said in December 1987 that he would not seek a
statewide office and last September said he would not seek a fifth
mayoral term because he wanted to devote time to his ill son, John
Paul Anthony, who was born with a heart defect and stomach
abnormalities.
   A month later, published reports linked Cisneros in a romantic
relationship with former fundraiser Linda Medlar.
   Cisneros said then he wanted time to straighten out his private
life. He later said he has not been able to do so because of long
hours he put in during the campaign that resulted in voters Saturday
approving a half-cent sales tax tax increase to pay for a $174
million, 65,000-seat domed stadium.

<TEXT>
   Environmental groups can sue the government
to try to stop logging of old-growth fir near spotted owl nests in
western Oregon, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.
   The environmentalists' lawsuit had been dismissed by a federal
judge in Portland. But the 3-0 ruling on Tuesday by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals also lifted an appeals court's ban on new
sales of old-growth timber near spotted owl sites.
   Both sides claimed victory.
   ``We feel that that was a significant victory for the timber
associations,'' said industry lawyer Mark Rutzick. He said the most
important part of Tuesday's ruling was ``the decision to lift the
injunction and let the Bureau of Land Management resume full timber
sales, pending some future decision by the District Court in
Portland.''
   But attorney Victor Sher of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund
said the court's action does not give the industry what it wanted,
authority ``to allow sales to go forward unchallenged.''
   ``What they (the court) said is, we are entitled to challenge
those sales on a case-by-case basis as they arise now, and that the
District Court in Oregon has to hear our case,'' Sher said. ``We
certainly intend to proceed to protect these critical areas.''
   The environmentalists' suit had been dismissed by a federal judge
in Portland.
   While removing the ban it imposed last June on new sales of
old-growth fir within 2.1 miles of a spotted owl site, the court
said environmental groups could ask U.S. District Judge Helen Frye
in Portland to forbid specific sales as they were proposed. The
groups would have to show a likelihood of proving that a threat to
the owl habitat violated federal law, the court said.
   The timber industry blamed the court's previous order for
shutdowns of five lumber and plywood mills and reductions by nine
others since Sept. 1, leading to the loss of 1,000 jobs.
   Sher said those claims were based on ``false and irresponsible''
statements. He said many of the mills were not authorized to buy
timber from BLM lands, or had not bought any in 10 years.
   The spotted owl, which lives in northern California, Oregon and
Washington, is not listed as an endangered species under federal
law, although Sher said a federal judge has ordered the Fish and
Wildlife Service to reassess the bird's status by May 1.
   Environmental groups regard the spotted owl as an ``indicator''
species, whose reduction foreshadows a threat to other forms of
life. There are 289 spotted owl sites within the timber sale area on
the western slope of the Cascades, Sher said. The suit contends
logging of old-growth timber would kill the birds by destroying
their habitat.

   President P.W. Botha left a
military hospital Tuesday, six days after suffering a stroke, but he
was expected to need several weeks to recover.
   The 73-year-old Botha and his wife Elize declined to talk to
reporters as they were driven out of No. 2 Military Hospital in a
Cape Town suburb.
   Botha is expected to recuperate at his official residence outside
Cape Town from the effects of the stroke he suffered Wednesday.
   Botha has appointed Constitutional Development Minister Chris
Heunis to serve as acting president. There has been speculation that
Botha may retire soon, but neither he nor other high-ranking
government leaders have spoken publicly about his intentions.
   Health Minister Willie Van Niekerk, a physician, said Saturday
that Botha would need to rest at least six weeks before he could
consider returning to work.
   Botha's doctors have said the stroke weakened his left arm and
left leg but that his facial muscles and speaking ability were not
affected.
   Parliament opens this year's session Feb. 3, and prior to Botha's
stroke there had been speculation he would use the occasion to
announce a general election for late April.
   Political analysts now say an election is unlikely until after
Botha makes a full recovery or until a permanent successor
establishes himself in office.

   Rescuers used bulldozers, cranes and excavators to

<HEAD>Indians Leaving Rebel Zones as Violence Declines in Guatemala</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEBAJ, Guatemala (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Ixil Indians, ignoring
leftist guerrillas warnings that the Guatemalan army would kill them
if they left their mountain refuge, are coming down from the cold
misty heights and settling in around an army garrison town.
   ``In the mountains there are no clothes, no medicines, no salt,
no nothing,'' said Benito Perez, 22, who came down with his mother
in October after seven years in the rebel-patrolled mountains.
   ``The guerrillas tell us the army will kill us, torture us if we
come down, but word has reached those parts that it is not like that
now.''
   The guerrillas have been battling military and military-dominated
Guatemalan governments for a quarter-century. The northern area of
Quiche province, about 70 miles northwest of Guatemala City, was one
of their bastions in the early 1980s.
   Government forces mounted a counterinsurgency campaign that has
reduced guerrilla activity to isolated and circumscribed zones.
   The campaign was heavily criticized by human rights activists who
blamed the army for the massacre of tens of thousands of Indians
throughout northern and western Guatemala.
   The army sweeps and aerial bombardment drove thousands of Ixils
out of their homes and into the heights north of Nebaj.
   Now they are trickling back.
   ``They suffer hunger and sickness in the mountains,'' said Alba
Mendez, psychologist for the government-licensed Special Commission
for Refugees and the Displaced, or CEARD, as it is known by its
initials in Spanish.
   The human rights organization Americas Watch said in November
that most of the 1,700 or so Indians who reached Nebaj in the first
six months of 1988 were captured by government troops during
offensives and forcibly removed.
   But Indians continue to come down from the mountains, albeit at a
slower pace, even though the armed forces have not carried out
large-scale operations north of Nebaj in recent months.
   Miss Mendez said an average of about 40 Ixils have arrived each
month since September. She said virtually all of them came
voluntarily.
   Relief officials say about 4,500 Ixils have come out of the
mountains since 1987 and that several thousand probably remain in
the highlands.
   Jacinto de Paz, who abandoned the hills with his wife and three
children late last year, said he was a guerrilla political officer
who helped administer rebel-controlled hamlets.
   ``They (the guerrillas) have told everyone the army killed me,''
he said. ``But as you can see, I am not dead. Politically, they are
losing strength, so they tell a lot of lies. But the situation has
changed. That is why we're here.''
   New arrivals are held at the army garrison for several days, with
fighting-age men debriefed by intelligence officers. They are then
transferred to the Xemamatze camp about a mile outside Nebaj.
   Some human rights groups have described Xemamatze as a
concentration camp, but a recent visitor saw no wire or fence around
it. Refugees must check in and out at the gate but otherwise are
free to enter and leave.
   In the camp, women in distinctive red skirts and multicolored
Huipil blouses cook food and tend children in front of wooden,
tin-roofed shelters that border a courtyard that doubles as a soccer
field.
   About 80 people were at Xemamatze in early January. In mid-1988
as many as 580 people were housed there, CEARD officals said.
   Officials at CEARD said the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees pays for food, blankets and clothes distributed at the camp.
   The displaced spend between one and three months at the camp
attending re-education classes. They are taught Guatemala's national
anthem and indoctrinated with the idea that communism is evil.
   From Xemamatze, they return to their old hamlets or take up
residence in one of the surrounding villages established by the army
and government.
   The villages are made up of rows or clusters of wooden-walled,
metal-roofed one-room dwellings with dirt floors. But they have
electricity and communal potable water and are by most accounts an
improvement on the sometimes nomadic life in the mountains.
   Doctors and nurses from international relief organizations visit
the settlements, whose inhabitants also have access to a modern
clinic in Nebaj.
   In addition to providing homes for the displaced, the villages
are a means by which the military maintains control over a
population that in the past demonstrated guerrilla sympathies.
   Men aged 16 to 60 participate in civil defense patrols designed
to inhibit guerrilla movement.
   The villages are administered by locally elected councils that
work closely with army authorities.
   ``This war has become one of attention paid to people, of human
relations,'' said Capt. Carlos Rodriguez of the Nebaj garrison.
``People realize there has been a change in the way the army acts.
Now we concentrate on psychological operations. We offer a hand to
those who come down (from the mountains) and to the subversives who
realize their error. We reserve the iron fist only for the
intransigents.''

<BYLINE>By IRENE M. KUNII</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of Emperor Hirohito has brought a wave of
questions about Japan's monarchical system and its religious
connections from scholars, politicians and the public.
   The main questions deal with Hirohito's role in World War II and
the separation of religion and state _ the latter because the
monarchy is seen by some as a link between the two.
   The religion question is especially touchy as Japan prepares to
bury Hirohito and formally enthrone his son, Emperor Akihito.
   Some public figures have received death threats _ allegedly from
rightists _after making critical statements about the monarchy or
the Shintoism, which once was the state religion. They included
Mayor Hitoshi Motoshim of atom-bombed Nagasaki and Makato Mori,
president of Meiji Gakuin University, which did not issue a
condolence statement after Hirohito's death.
   Takako Doi, a member of the Diet (parliament) and chairwoman of
the Japan Socialist Party, was featured on newspaper front pages
after saying Hirohito, as supreme military commander, bore some
responsibility for the war.
   ``Recent criticisms in overseas mass media have been very
severe,'' she said in response to a question about Hirohito's
wartime role. ``The Japanese people must accept these very
modestly.''
   Until the end of World War II in 1945, Hirohito was worshiped by
the Japanese as a divinity. Critics say any government connection
with Shinto rites for Hirohito's funeral and for ceremonies
involving the ascension of Akihito to the throne could augur a
return to the era of a state religion and religious oppression.
   ``The government is violating the constitution, which stipulates
a separation of state and religion,'' said Takeshi Kobayashi,
professor of constitutional law at Nanzai University in Nagoya.
   Akihito, 55, immediately succeeded to the throne upon his
father's death but he still is expected to perform a series of
ascension rites that the government defends as ceremonies permitted
under the constitution.
   Kobayashi maintained that by funding and attending religious
rites, government leaders signal support for Shinto, which preached
nationalism and devotion to a god-emperor during Japan's fascist
period.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita has said he would attend a
religious ceremony at the start of the state funeral Feb. 24.
President Bush will come to Japan for the funeral but it is not
known which aspects of it he and other foreign dignitaries will
attend.
   But about 100 foreign dignitaries are expected to attend the
``Sojoden-no-gi,'' a Shinto ceremony sponsored by the imperial
palace. One Foreign Ministry official said the rite will be stripped
of its religious trappings.
   Members of Takeshita's Liberal Democratic Party are also
preparing to hold the ``Daijosai,'' or the Great Food Offering
Ritual, as a state affair for Akihito in November 1990, according to
news reports.
   The Daijosai, the last of three enthronement rites, is based on
ancient myths resurrected in the mid-Meiji period (1868-1912) by a
government intent on forming a state faith.
   Like his father and grandfather, Akihito would share sacred rice
and wine in a communion with the sun-goddess Ameratasu and other
ancestral spirits, and then receive the spirit of the late emperor.
Critics say this rite is the base of the old idea that the emperor
was divine.
   Koichi Yokota, a Kyushu University professor who specializes in
constitutional law, charges that by sponsoring such rites the
government is attempting to blur the role of the emperor as only a
symbol of the nation as mandated by the 1947 consititution, drafted
by U.S. occupation officials.
   ``The term `symbol' (in Japanese) is vague and can imply whatever
is convenient,'' Yokota said in a round-table discussion sponsored
by the Asahi Shimbun, a leading daily.
   Masanori Nakamura, Hitotsubashi University professor of economic
history, contends that conservative politicians favor a new
nationalism with the emperor playing an important part of it.
   ``While they may get (the people) to love family and love
society, they won't be able to link it up to the patriotism'' of
prewar and wartime Japan, Nakamura said at another meeting.
   Hirohito died without clarifying where he stood when Japan
declared war.
   ``If the emperor was able to end the war, then he could have done
something to prevent it,'' charged Takako Sodei, professor at
Ochanomizu Women's University.

<HEAD>Haing Ngor Returns to Cambodian Border for Documentary</HEAD>

   Academy Award-winner Haing Ngor appears Sunday
in a half-hour documentary called ``Beyond the Killing Fields'' that
he hopes will ``wake up the world'' to the plight of Cambodian
refugees.
   ``The documentary shows the work I'm doing and is about the
suffering of the people at the border,'' he said. ``We must wake up
the world. Why has the world forgotten Cambodia and especially its
children?
   ``Before `The Killing Fields' no one knew what happened in
Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge killed 4 million people. If Vietnam pulls
out and the Khmer Rouge return they may kill the rest of the
people.''
   Ngor, who won the Oscar as best supporting actor for ``The
Killing Fields'' in 1984, appears in a segment of ``National
Geographic Explorer'' this Sunday on SuperStation TBS.
   He has been devoting most of his spare time and money from his
acting career to helping the many thousands of Cambodian refugees
driven from their own country and forced by international policies
to stay in the camps in Thailand. He works through two groups he has
organized, Aid to Displaced Persons and Enfant d'Angkor.
   ``My main goal is to build a hospital to help the refugees,'' he
said. ``Right now that's hard because of the Thailand government.
They talk, but we haven't seen a green light. The money is there
from contributions raised in Europe.''
   The Khmer Rouge is the Chinese-backed communist faction that
overthrew the republic in 1975. The Soviet-backed Vietnamese pushed
the Khmer Rouge out in 1979, but now the Vietnamese are considering
a pullout. Ngor said he estimates the population was 7.5 million to
8 million in 1970. He believes between 700,000 and 1 million died
between 1970 and 1975.
   During the reign of the Khmer Rouge, Ngor said, his personal
estimate is that 4 million Cambodians were killed. The International
Red Cross places the number of deaths at 2 million.
   ``The communists never think of civil rights,'' he said. ``If
they want to kill, they kill. The Khmer Rouge want to create a
utopian society. Mostly, they want power. All the power. `The
Killing Fields' told the story of one family that got out. But what
about the millions more who didn't get out? Almost my whole family
was killed by the Khmer Rouge.''
   Ngor, a small, intense, be-spectacled man, lost his parents, his
brothers and sisters and his girlfriend. He had been a physician and
suffered intense and crippling torture at the hands of the Khmer
Rouge.
   ``My life is like skin of teeth,'' he said. ```The Killing
Fields' just touched the tip of the iceberg. The real story is much
worse.''
   He won the Oscar for playing Dith Pran in ``The Killing Fields.''
He plays a North Vietnamese army captain in ``The Iron Triangle,''
which stars Beau Bridges. He recently began work in ``Orange
Curtain,'' a movie about Vietnamese in this country.
   He also will play himself in a movie based on his autobiography,
``Free at Last,'' and will star in another film called ``The Other
War.''
   Ngor said he needs the world's support to keep the Khmer Rouge
from returning to power.
   ``I don't want history to be repeated,'' he said. ``My people,
innocent people, will pay the price. The Khmer Rouge have already
killed 95 percent of the educated people of Cambodia. Most of those
at the border are orphaned children. They are the next generation of
Cambodians.
   ``I was happy when the National Geographic people came to me. I
am happy that we can show the world what happened to my country. The
war is not yet over. The killings are not over yet.''

show for the fall. The show's already been cleared in 72 cities.
``Lassie'' ran on CBS in 1954-71. The collie made her first
appearance in the 1943 movie ``Lassie, Come Home,'' which starred
Roddy McDowall and featured Elizabeth Taylor in a small role. The
last ``Lassie'' movie was ``The Magic of Lassie'' in 1978, with
James Stewart and Mickey Rooney.
   GOOD GUY TURNS BAD ... Dennis Farina, who starred in ``Crime
Story,'' will play convicted killer Angelo Buono in the NBC movie
``Blood Brothers: The Hillside Stranglers.'' Richard Crenna will
play Sgt. Bob Grogan, the Los Angeles homicide detective who broke
the case. Los Angeles was terrorized between October 1977 and
February 1978 by 10 brutal murders attributed to the Hillside
Stranglers.

<HEAD>Can These Housing Numbers Be Ignored?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sharp disparities in local real estate prices _
between abutting communities and neighborhoods within them _
eventually become muted by financial pressures, such as those that
exist today.
   And the stage is being set once again for major shifts of the
same sort on the national scene _ that is, from state to state and
city to city. Should it occur, it probably will be for the same
reasons dictating the local moves.
   In this metropolitan area, for example, Hoboken and other
lower-priced New Jersey communities that once seemed beyond
consideration by builders, are ``in.'' Smart buyers and renters
flock there to get a view of New York's skyline.
   The once dilapitated Times Square area and Midtown's neglected
West Side are being rebuilt, and no doubt will attract people who
once would live nowhere but in Greenwich Village or the Upper West
Side. Harlem may be next.
   The process has occurred in almost every city in America as
financial factors overcome prejudice. Bargains become too great to
decline. Factors such as cultural reputation and social
acceptability give way not just to price but to an appreciation of
natural beauty and convenience. What was out becomes in.
   Enormous disparities in housing costs now suggest that some of
those same factors will be working on the national scene as well.
   Consider, for example, that payments on the average
conventionally financed St. Louis dwelling require 18.2 percent of
income compared with 35.5 percent in the New York area and you see
why individuals and industry must take notice.
   Lomas Mortgage USA, which produced these figures from its
continuing study of real estate markets, offers this breakdown:
   ST. LOUIS: Household income $46,900. New home price $103,400.
Monthly payment $796.95. Percentage of income required 20.4 percent.
Existing home price $93,500. Monthly payment $675.59. Percentage of
income 17.3.
   NEW YORK CITY AREA: Household income $48,000. New home price
$167,500. Monthly payment $1,340.72. Percentage of income needed
33.5 percent. Existing home price $135,400. Monthly payment
$1,093.76. Percentage of income 27.3.
   In a special report to subscribers of Lomas' ``U.S. Housing
Markets,'' the 10 least affordable metropolitan areas were listed as
New York, Sa Diego, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco Bay,
Washington, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Baltimore, Seattle-Tacoma. All
were near either the East or West coast.
   In contrast, the 10 most affordable areas were St. Louis,
Cleveland, Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Kansas City, Indianapolis,
Portland, Ore., Greensboro, S.C., Detroit-Ann Arbor and Salt Lake
City.
   A critical factor in evaluating the disparity in these figures is
the financial pressure placed on young households today. Many
require two incomes. Savings rates are down, but down payments are
up.
   The price of housing, therefore, becomes a vital factor in
maintaining lifestyle, and eventually may be the determining factor
_ even beyond employment _ in making a move. It is a pattern that
industry cannot ignore.
   Paul Low, Lomas Mortgage president, points to national figures in
making the point.
   He observes that while the U.S. average household income rose
from $35,500 in 1984 to $43,000 in 1988, the selling price of the
average conventional financed dwelling soared to $130,800 from
$83,100.
   Household income advanced 21 percent in the four-year period. The
average home price ran up 57.4 percent, producing a situation that
makes home-ownership much more difficult than it was in 1977.
   In that year, says Low, more than half the nation's first-time
homebuyers were able to make at least a 20 percent down payment. But
10 years later, though median household income had nearly doubled,
less than one-third of first-timers were able to put 20 percent down.

<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first and only time Bill Griggs saw
Buddy Holly perform, he didn't know the bespectacled youth with a
Texas twang was the lead singer for his favorite band, the Crickets
because Holly released songs under his own name as well.
   ``I hate to admit that now,'' said Griggs, who has devoted his
life since that 1958 show to keeping alive the legend of Holly and
other innovators of rock 'n' roll.
   As the president and founder of the Buddy Holly Memorial Society,
he is one of the leading experts on Holly's life and music and owns
an extensive collection of Holly memorabilia. He started a fan club
14 years ago so that the memory of his idol would not fade away.
   ``I was no longer seeing Buddy Holly in the media, no longer
hearing his music on the radio,'' he said. ``I just thought he had
been forgotten after 1959.''
   The organization had more than 400 members after its first year
and now has almost 5,400 members from 31 countries who gather yearly
to share memories and swap memorabilia.
   ``It's not so much a fan club as a research organization,''
Griggs said. ``We're trying to find out as much as we can about the
man and his music. I've interviewed just about everybody that I know
of that knew him or worked with him.''
   The results of Griggs' research efforts almost fill two rooms of
his home. Records, posters, photos and sheet music from Holly and
other 1950s rockers are stacked on tables and pinned to walls.
   A glass case is reserved for Griggs' most cherished memorabilia:
a pair of Holly's famous horn-rimmed glasses; a suit jacket; a pair
of his black oxfords; a broken guitar string and even a guitar pick
used by actor Gary Busey in ``The Buddy Holly Story.''
   One of Griggs' most recent acquisitions is Holly's toilet kit,
carried with him on the night 30 years ago when the plane carrying
Holly, J.P. ``The Big Bopper'' Richardson and Ritchie Valens crashed
near Clear Lake, Iowa.
   Inside the brown leather bag is toothpaste, a comb and brush,
suntan lotion, hair gel and other personal items, covered with the
dust and grime of 1959.
   ``This is very personal,'' he said with awe. ``It's the last
thing he had in his hands.'' Griggs declined to say how he obtained
it.
   ``The reverence with which Griggs handles Holly's belongings was
strong enough to draw him and his family to Lubbock from his home in
Wethersfield, Conn., in 1980 after having visited here for several
years.
   ``It was Buddy Holly that brought us here in the first place and
why we decided to move,'' said Griggs, adding that he since has
grown close to Holly's remaining relatives. The singer's mother, two
brothers and a sister still live here.
   ``I'm like family to them now and that's a very good feeling.''
   So strong is Griggs' attachment to the rock 'n' roll era that the
former K mart manager now makes a living running a mail-order '50s
memorabilia business.
   ``Nostalgia's become big,'' he said. ``People that lived through
the era want to remember it. Those that didn't feel cheated, and
they want to know why their parents are so high on the '50s and why
they're hearing all these '50s songs on TV and radio commercials.''
   Griggs, 47, whose slicked back hair is reminiscent of the era he
loves, says the time between 1955 and the assassination of President
Kennedy in 1963 was a simpler, more wholesome time.
   ``We weren't at war, the kids didn't have a drug problem, we
weren't burning draft cards. We went to college to learn, not to
protest,'' he said. ``A few guys had greased hair and leather
jackets and that's about as bad as it got.''
   Today's world isn't so nice, he says, and contemporary music is
just one symptom of what ails the '80s. ``I'm really down on today's
music; it all sounds the same.''
   Now Buddy Holly _ that was rock 'n' roll.
   ``Buddy never copied himself,'' Griggs said. ``He was never
afraid to experiment, and this is a 22-year-old kid we're talking
about. Buddy was the first white rock 'n' roll performer to use a
full orchestra and strings and was one of the first to overdub his
voice.''
   Appreciation for Holly's contribution to rock has steadily grown
since the release of the movie about his life in 1978 and several
recent biographies.
   As Holly's No. 1 fan, Griggs feels a sense of accomplishment.
   ``He won't be forgotten now,'' he said. ``I still think that what
he did in 18 months is amazing compared to what Elvis Presley did in
27 years and what the Beatles did in nine years.
   ``He left this 18-month legacy of great music that's as fresh
today as it was then.''

   ``I have thought about making a career out of western music if I
am good enough but I will just have to wait to see how that turns
out.'' _ Buddy Holly, (high school autobiography).

   Maria Elena Holly spends much of her time
hunched over a paper-piled desk in her home, trying to make Buddy
Holly's dreams come true.
   The legendary singer, songwriter and musician, who with his own
blend of rock 'n' roll and country influenced the Beatles, the
Rolling Stones and many others, dreamed that he would inspire young
musicians and pave their way in the industry, his widow said.
   ``If Buddy were still alive, I think that he would be involved in
every facet of the music industry,'' she said.
   Although she has tried to realize that dream through a Buddy
Holly scholarship fund, preferably at Texas Tech University in
Holly's hometown of Lubbock, or through a festival there, each
attempt has failed.
   Three decades after Holly was killed in a plane crash, his widow
pursues his dreams by answering letters from fans who say they will
always remember, and from opportunists who say there is money to be
made making sure the public doesn't forget.
   Maria Elena Holly receives letters from three to 10 people each
day.
   ``Buddy wrote and wanted his music to be received in a positive
way and for people to enjoy it and for people to be inspired by his
music and his determination to make it out there,'' she said.
   ``And that's where I come in with the youngsters. I feel that
through the letters, it has done that. Anything that is a positive
thing received from Buddy Holly's music, it makes me happy. It
pushes me out there to continue putting his name out there and keep
it there.''
   But she's not making Holly available to the public without some
personal benefit.
   In 1987, she successfully lobbied Texas lawmakers to approve
legislation giving her full rights to Holly's name, voice, likeness,
photographs and signature. Under the law, Holly's ``property''
cannot be used for commercial purposes without her approval.
   Bill Griggs, president and founder of the Buddy Holly Memorial
Society, says the law serves a good purpose.
   ``If you go to Memphis, Tenn., to Graceland, across the street is
souvenir store after souvenir store. You can buy Elvis Presley
toilet paper, which to me is the epitome of bad taste,'' he said.
``That's why Maria Elena is so tough. She wants to make sure
everything is done above board and in good taste.''
   Not only does the law keep Holly's name and face off beer cans,
as one entrepreneur proposed, but it also allows her to profit from
the Buddy Holly music boxes, posters and T-shirts that are sold.
   ``That was his legacy he left to us (his family) and the music
was his legacy he left to everybody,'' she said. ``I feel very
strongly that if someone is going to make money, I'm going to make
money and the Hollys are going to make money.''
   Maria Elena Santiago, a native of Puerto Rico, met Buddy Holly
while she was a receptionist at Peer-Southern Music Publishing Co.,
in New York. The morning after they met, Holly confronted Maria
Elena's aunt, who disliked musicians, and asked for permission to
marry her neice.
   They had been married just six months when the small plane
carrying Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. ``The Big Bopper''
Richardson crashed near Clear Lake, Iowa, on Feb. 3, 1959, killing
all three and their pilot.
   She was pregnant when Holly left on the tour and she suffered a
miscarriage after the crash. A year after Holly died, she remarried.
She and her second husband had three children before they divorced
three years ago.
   It was her dedication to Holly that helped end her second
marriage.
   ``People ask you, `How did you get over his death?' Well you
don't get over his death. You never do. You cope with it, but you
never get over it,'' she said, turning her head to hide tears.
``Sometimes I do get upset and then I pick myself up and I say this
is not going to bring him back, so why not keep him here.''
   Besides a few posthumously bestowed music awards and a few photos
of Holly, she keeps his Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar and his black,
plastic-frame glasses. The glasses were found long after the crash,
stored in an Iowa sheriff's files.
   Holly's Fender Stratocaster and other belongings are in Lubbock
with his family, who are involved in negotiations with his widow to
divide the items.
   Although she appreciates a statue erected by Holly's friends, she
would have preferred the money to have been spent on a music
scholarship.
   ``That's what Buddy wanted,'' she said of the scholarship.
``Buddy wanted to help young people get established in the music
industry, to be able to help them in whatever career they chose in
music.''

   Buddy Holly influenced generations of
musicians. So does his hometown give him fitting recognition?
   That'll be the day, say fans and friends.
   They complain that 30 years after his death, this city takes
scant notice of its most famous native son.
   Holly was 22 when he died on Feb. 3, 1959, after the small plane
carrying him, Ritchie Valens and J.P. ``The Big Bopper'' Richardson
crashed near Clear Lake, Iowa.
   A life-size bronze statue stands in downtown Lubbock as a tribute
to the famous singer and musician who lived almost all his short
life in this windswept farming town. But it was erected by a few of
Holly's friends, not the city government.
   Lubbock's efforts to capitalize on Holly are pale compared to the
million-dollar industry Memphis built around the legacy of Elvis
Presley.
   ``This is the hometown of Buddy Holly and he should be remembered
here,'' said Bill Griggs, the president and founder of Buddy Holly
Memorial Society. ``I'm not saying every street should be named
after him and every radio station should be playing his music, but
there just isn't that much here for the fans.''
   Those fans have not forgotten the sound of the shy young Texan
with the toothy smile, big black spectacles and hiccup-laced vocal
style that influenced recording artists as diverse as the Rolling
Stones and Linda Ronstadt. Around the anniversaries of his birthday
and death, flowers cover Holly's simple, marble grave marker _
inscribed with a Fender Stratoscaster _ which lies in the city
cemetery.
   Born Charles Hardin Holley, the fourth child of Lawrence and Ella
Holley, the boy known as Buddy took an early interest in music and
was influenced by the country music he heard on the radio. The ``e''
in his family name was dropped on the singer's first recording
contract.
   From his first public exposure _ at age 17 on radio station
KDAV's ``Sunday Party'' show as a country duo with his friend Bob
Montgomery _ Holly's local stature was low-key.
   While most agree Holly deserves more hometown recognition,
there's contention over who is to blame for the lack of local homage.
   Some Holly devotees blame his widow, Maria Elena Holly, for
blocking those seeking permission to use her late husband's name for
memorial concerts.
   Civic Lubbock Inc., a city-appointed, non-profit organization,
sponsors an annual music festival at the time of Holly's birthday,
but the number of musical offerings, as well as attendance, have
declined steadily since the first festival in 1986.
   But the event no longer can use the singer's name since Mrs.
Holly successfully lobbied the 1987 Texas Legislature for a law
forbidding commercial use of Holly's likeness, voice or name without
her permission.
   On the other hand, she says city and festival officials aren't
interested in promoting Holly with a music festival.
   ``For almost 30 years now I have been talking to the officials
and trying to convince them that doing a Buddy Holly week would help
in every way,'' she said. ``But it's one thing or another, and
nothing ever gets done.''
   Jeff Klotzman, a Civic Lubbock board member, says the city hasn't
given up trying to promote Lubbock's famous citizen with a festival.
   ``The commitment is definitely there and the intent is to honor
Holly,'' he said. ``I don't think the city has turned its back on
Buddy Holly by any stretch of the imagination.''
   Mrs. Holly and others say no one in Lubbock cared much about
Holly even when he was alive.
   ``You'd mention Buddy Holly around here and people would say,
`Oh, you mean that kid who used to play down at the fruit and
vegetable?''' said Larry Corbin, former owner of a country radio
station where Holly held informal jam sessions.
   Griggs said the city's disorganized attempt to stage a music
festival was one reason the Buddy Holly Memorial Society moved its
10th annual convention away from Lubbock. For two years, the
gathering of hundreds of fans has been held in Clovis, N.M., where
the singer recorded most of his hits.
   ``I'm not trying to be derogatory, but the people in charge in
this town are from the big band era,'' said Griggs, who is bringing
the meeting back to Lubbock because of its accessibility and
proximity to Holly's grave. ``I think we made our point to the
city.''
   Prior to the 1978 release of the movie ``The Buddy Holly Story,''
there was nothing in Lubbock to commemorate the singer. City
officials rushed to put Holly's name on a park, built on the
outskirts of town over an old landfill. The park sign bearing
Holly's name has been defaced with spray-painted obscenities and a
swastika.
   In 1978, country superstar Waylon Jennings, Holly's bass player
on his final, ill-fated tour, and other Holly friends had the statue
built.
   ``Waylon just wanted to do something for Buddy in Lubbock, since
he gave him his start,'' said Corbin, who also put up money for the
project.
   But the bronze statue stood on a plot of city land for three
years without anything to say who it was. Finally, the statue was
rededicated, this time with a plaque.
   His grave, the park and the statue remain the only reminders of
Holly. The small, white frame house where he was born had been
slated for demolition, ironically on the 18th anniversary of his
death. It was saved after someone unaware of its historical
significance purchased and moved the structure to another location.
Now the lot stands vacant and weed-grown.
   And while the Iowa town where Holly died has a ``Buddy Holly
Place'' among its streets, no road or avenue in Lubbock bears the
singer's name.

   ``A long, long time ago I can still remember how that music used
to make me smile. And I knew if I had my chance that I could make
those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for awhile. But
February made me shiver with ev'ry paper I'd deliver. Bad news on

inside the day the music died.'' _ Don McLean, ``American Pie.''

   After three decades, the Crickets are looking to complete the
trip their leader Buddy Holly couldn't.
   On Feb. 3, 1989, the band is booked to perform in Fargo, N.D.,
the city Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. ``Big Bopper'' Richardson
were scheduled to play on that date 30 years ago. Instead, their
plane crashed in a snowstorm, killing all three musicians and their
pilot.
   Immortalized as ``the day the music died'' in Don McLean's 1972
epic pop song, ``American Pie,'' the plane crash was the first great
rock tragedy.
   ``It's going to feel a little strange, I'll have to admit,'' said
Jerry Allison, one of two original Crickets still playing with the
band, of the Fargo date. ``I still miss Buddy because he and I grew
up together.''
   In less innocent times, musicians would be struck down by drugs,
drink, cars, guns and suicide. Their deaths form a macabre rock 'n'
roll hall of fame. Among them: John Lennon, Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke,
Andy Gibb, Phil Ochs, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Peter Tosh, Paul
Butterfield, Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, Brian Jones, Keith Moon.
   But when Holly's tour plane went down seven miles north of Clear
Lake, Iowa, kids wore black armbands to school to honor stars not
much older than themselves.
   Holly was only 22 when he died; Valens was 17. Both were at the
beginning of their careers, but left behind enough work to create a
sense of unfulfilled potential that nags today.
   Along with Chuck Berry, rock 'n' roll's first great poet, Holly
was one of the first musicians in the rock era to write much of his
own material. He was the first to experiment with now-common studio
techniques such as overdubbing, and his ``hiccupping'' vocal style
influenced such followers as Paul McCartney, who now owns the rights
to Holly's songs.
   ``Books have been written about the way he structured his
songs,'' Scott Isler, senior editor of Musician magazine, said of
the spare rock that propelled Holly through such hits as ``Peggy
Sue,'' ``Rave On,'' ``Not Fade Away'' and ``It's So Easy.''
   His music lives today on compact disks, a laser-driven technology
of which Holly probably would not have dreamed, and in automobile
commercials, a setting which may have made him cringe.
   Valens' legacy is more modest, although he was put back in the
public eye with the 1987 movie ``La Bamba.'' The band Los Lobos also
re-released Valens' song of the same name that year and made it a
hit. Valens other hits included ``Donna'' and ``Come on, Let's Go.''
The Big Bopper, a former disc jockey, was known for his song,
``Chantilly Lace.''
   Through movies of the lives of Holly and Valens (one hasn't been
made on Richardson), millions of people have learned how Holly
chartered a plane because he wanted to hurry to Fargo to get his
laundry done.
   The Crickets weren't with Holly on his final tour. They stayed
behind in Lubbock, Texas, when Holly left his hometown to get
married in New York City. Crickets guitarist Sonny Curtis shook
Allison awake the morning after with news of the crash.
   ``The whole thing was unbelievable,'' said Allison, who would
rather celebrate the anniversary of Holly's birth (Sept. 7, 1936)
than the day of his death. But the Crickets are a working country
band and they don't shy away from gigs or Holly's memory. Allison
co-wrote some of Holly's best-known songs, including ``That'll Be
the Day.''
   Clear Lake has remembered the three artists with an annual
anniversary concert held for the last 10 years at the Surf Ballroom,
where they gave their final performance. This year's event is
already sold out.
   ``They're proud of Buddy Holly and they like to flaunt the idea
this is where Buddy Holly gave his last concert,'' said disc jockey
Daryl Hensley, organizer of the event.
   This year's concert stars the Diamonds, Bobby Vee and Freddie
``Boom Boom'' Cannon, rock relics from the Holly era.
   Vee took over Holly's scheduled appearance the night after the
crash.
   Meanwhile, the historical society in Beaumont, Texas,
Richardson's hometown, plans to raise two statues on Feb. 3 _ one of
Buddy Holly, Richardson and Valens, and a second of the Big Bopper
alone.
   Musicians have long speculated where Holly's muse would have
taken him had he lived. He was recording with a full orchestra
shortly before he died and confided that he wanted to make gospel
music like Ray Charles, Allison said.
   ``Would he have turned into a supper club crooner or would he
have gone on to write some incredible stuff and break barriers
down?'' Isler said.
   Referring to the crash as ``the day the music died'' is a bit
hyperbolic, ``although it makes a great song lyric,'' Isler said.
   When ``American Pie'' came out, Allison went to a record store
and bought it, pleased that another musician thought so fondly of
Holly. He even backed McLean at a concert in Texas where the
singer-songwriter sang the eight-minute fable littered with obscure
musical metaphors.

   Officials at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are
asking nervous traders not to overreact to a sweeping federal probe
of fraud in the markets, but warn they would deal harshly with rule
violators.
   The futures exchange's board of governors met Monday to discuss
the broad undercover investigation and issued a letter urging
traders ``not to be driven to irrational or self-destructive
behavior by the adverse publicity.''
   Last week, it was reveled that federal authorities have been
investigating the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade for two years
on allegations that as many as 100 brokers and traders
systematically cheated customers out of millions of dollars.

administration fails to move quickly to end a stubborn trade dispute
over hormone-treated meat from America.
   Ministers of the 12-nation European Economic Community agreed
Monday to slap duties on imports of U.S. walnuts and dried fruit but
indefinitely delayed implementing the tariffs to allow more time to
settle the conflict.
   The Common Market on Jan. 1 banned imports of U.S. meat from
cattle treated with growth hormones, an action affecting about $100
million worth of beef and beef byproducts.

   The energy futures market began the week with a
selloff as the price of crude oil dipped below $18 a barrel and
refined petroleum products lost more than 2 cents a gallon.
   Technical factors and profit-taking were mostly blamed for
Monday's decline, which some analysts called an expected
``correction'' following a recent strong rally fueled by confidence
in OPEC's production-cutting pact.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate _ the benchmark grade of U.S. crude _ plunged
$1.06 to settle Monday at $17.33 a barrel, near the low of the day.
The February contract, which expired on Friday, had closed down 42
cents at the end of the week.
   Among refined contracts traded on the exchange Monday, February
home heating oil settled 2.10 cents lower to 50.36 a gallon, after
losing 1.15 cents on Friday.
   The February contract for unleaded gasoline, which declined 0.32
cent in Friday's session, settled Monday at 49.57 cents a gallon,
down 2.08 cents.
   The market started out on a down note, and prices continued to
deteriorate as Monday's session wore on.
   ``There were just waves of selling ... from everywhere today,''
explained Peter Beutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
``A lot of people had felt that a correction was long overdue, but
they just didn't want to get out.''
   Beutel noted that since early October, West Texas Intermediate
had risen more than $7 to over $19 a barrel on optimism that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would significantly
cut its output to help shore up sagging worldwide prices.
   A daily quota of 18.5 million barrels went into effect Jan. 1,
and traders said there were indications that OPEC was sticking to
that level.
   Bob Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said
he didn't feel that the overall market confidence in OPEC's
agreement had changed. ``I really call it a technical correction to
a substantial rise.''

   A prosecutor says the ex-president of a
defunct Livingston brokerage house will testify against a former
board member of the New York Federal Reserve Bank who was accused in
the federal banking system's first insider trading case.
   The disclosure came at a hearing Monday where Gilbert C. Schulman
admitted lying on the witness stand during his two trials for
charges stemming from the $144 million collapse of Bevill, Bresler &amp;
Schulman Inc.
   Schulman, 41, also admitted lying when he denied during the
trials in April 1987 and July 1987 that he regularly received secret
interest rate data from a board member of the New York Federal
Reserve Bank, Robert A. Rough.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Weissman said at the hearing that
Schulman would be called as a witness against Rough at Rough's trial
on insider trading charges, scheduled to begin Feb. 21.
   Schulman testified he and Rough were friends for 15 years and met
and talked regularly during 1982 to 1984, when Rough served on the
New York Fed's board as president of the National Bank of Sussex
County in Branchville, but that no secret information was exchanged.
Rough has pleaded innocent.
   Also at the hearing before U.S. District Judge Dickinson R.
Debevoise, attorneys for Schulman asked for a reduction of
Schulman's eight-year sentence for securities and tax fraud.
   They suggested a total 30-month sentence _ he has served 16
months at the Allenwood, Pa., prison camp _ and five years
probation, including 2,500 hours of community service at a soup
kitchen.
   Debevoise sliced two years off the sentence. Attorneys said they
were not sure what portion of the six years Schulman would have to
serve.
   The judge recognized Schulman's cooperation in the government's
investigation of Rough.
   ``However, I must say my cynicism does have some effect here,''
he said. He noted that Schulman denied the charges in two trials,
the second resulting from a mistrial on some charges.
   ``When that failed, you turned over somebody to the government
for prosecution,'' Debevoise said.
   One of Schulman's attorneys, Benson B. Weintraub, said his client
was the subject of ``harassment and ridicule'' by other inmates and
staff at Allenwood because of his cooperation.
   ``He wears the jacket, your honor, of a snitch,'' he said.
   Weintraub also spoke of the suffering of Schulman's wife and five
children, aged 4 to 18, who sat in the row behind the defendant.
   Schulman told Debevoise he had come ``full circle'' and admitted
his guilt. He said he would do anything he could to repay investors
who lost money and to repay the Internal Revenue Service.
   Sentencing on the perjury plea was delayed until after the Rough
trial.
   Rough, 49, of Sandyston Township, was indicted Dec. 8 on charges
that he leaked secret data to Bevill, Bresler on the discount rate
set by the Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.
   The discount rate is the rate the Fed charges for loans to
financial institutions and is one of the clearest signals the
central bank has at its disposal to indicate its monetary policy to
the financial markets. The indictment said the firm made millions of
dollars and avoided losses on the basis of the information. In
exchange, Rough allegedly received $47,000 in interest-deferred
loans.
   The brokerage house collapsed in April 1985. Four executives who
pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors were subsequently
sent to prison for charges stemming from the collapse.
   As part of Schulman's plea, the government promised not to
prosecute him further for crimes involving Bevill, Bresler, and to
take no position at sentencing. The perjury charge carries a
five-year maximum sentence.
   Schulman agreed to cooperate fully and provide documents
requested by prosecutors.

   Futures traders of the 1980s have joined 19th
century industrialists and 1920s-era Wall Street financiers as
targets of public suspicion, says a business-school professor.
   Because futures traders can make a lot of money very quickly by
buying and selling things they don't even have, ``there is this
suspicion of the commodity speculators in Chicago,'' said Hans R.
Stoll, a professor of finance at the Owen Graduate School of
Management at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.
   ``It's much like the suspicion of mid-America vis-a-vis the
robber barons of New York or Wall Street financiers,'' Stoll said
Monday in a telephone interview. ``Over the years, the stock market
has solidified a more conservative image. But the futures markets
have had more of it (public suspicion) in recent years.''
   Suspicion by federal authorities has led to an FBI probe of
commodity fraud in Chicago, where the nation's two largest futures
exchanges are still smarting from the bashing their industry took
after the 1987 stock market crash.
   On futures exchanges, traders buy and sell contracts for future
delivery of products ranging from wheat to Treasury bonds. The FBI's
undercover investigation of the Chicago Board of Trade and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange is believed to be focused on organized
trade-rigging and profit-skimming by traders who work in the
exchanges' boisterous and crowded trading arenas, or ``pits.''
   The disclosure of the FBI's sting operation comes on the heels of
two smaller commodity fraud cases in Chicago and sets back the
exchanges' efforts to polish their industry's image in the wake of
the 1987 market collapse.
   Some experts contend that massive selling of stock index futures
contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Oct. 19, 1987,
steepened and accelerated the stock market's slide.
   A stock index future is a contract to buy or sell a specified
group of stocks at a set price by a specified date. Some of the
heavy selling of those contracts on Oct. 19 was by managers of large
investment portfolios trying to hedge their losses in the regular
stock market. Other traders sought to profit from price differences
between the index futures contracts and the underlying stocks.
   The Chicago exchanges have roundly denied the charge that
plummeting futures increased the pressure on stocks during the crash
and have offered evidence to refute it.
   But the dispute and the subsequent call by some in the securities
industry for tighter regulation of futures markets spotlight a
bitter rift stemming from the development of financial futures
contracts in Chicago in the early 1970s.
   Financial futures include the Chicago Board of Trade's
industry-leading Treasury bond futures contract and the Chicago
Merc's Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index futures contract. The trading
volume in these wildly successful products dwarfs that of stocks and
bonds _ and that means more money and power for the Chicago
exchanges.
   ``I think there's maybe some envy, some jealousy'' among the New
York-based securities establishment, said a market analyst who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
   ``People think of New York as the financial center of the world,
yet the most successful financial instruments were invented in
Chicago. So, of course, they're jealous.''
   Some players on Wall Street were rumored to be elated by news of
a major trading scandal in Chicago, but market-watchers couldn't or
wouldn't confirm such talk.
   ``Anybody who takes heart or solace in what happens in Chicago is
wrong,'' said James Cramer, president of Cramer &amp; Co., a small
money-management firm.
   ``And I think every one of us wishes the FBI would spend more
time knocking on the doors of people who sell crack than on the
doors of people who made a few out-trades (bad trades) on the
Chicago futures exchanges.''
   Fears that a long-running commodity scandal could sour
speculators on the futures markets contributed to a sharp dip in
seat prices on the exchanges last week, analysts said.
   But some of the members selling their seats may simply have been
doing what futures traders do for a living: betting on a trend.
   ``You don't have to own a seat, you can lease it,'' said Gordon
Linn, president of Linnco Futures Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Maybe you decide you'd rather lease than own because maybe this
type of thing (the probe) will drive seat prices down and you'll
have a chance to buy it cheaper.''

<HEAD>Chicago Fed: Drought Impact On Farm Banks Not As Severe As Once Feared</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite fears that drought would wilt
bank earnings in the summer of 1988, farm banks in the Midwest
improved their performance in the third quarter, even outperforming
non-agricultural counterparts, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago
says.
   ``It appears that the drought's effects on bank performance in
the third quarter were not as severe as once forecasted,'' said the
January edition of the Chicago Fed's ``Banking Barometer.''
   ``Particularly during the real apex of the drought ... analysts
were saying it would be real bad news for farm banks in the third
quarter. We didn't see it,'' George Gregorash, banking analysis
officer for the Chicago Fed, said Monday.
   Not only did earnings rise at 1,747 Midwest farm banks, but the
report said the quality of the banks' credit and assets also
improved in the July-September period.
   The report also said that while earnings for the U.S. banking
industry improved for a third straight quarter, reaching a record
$5.94 billion, problem loans continued to plague banks in the
Southwest.
   Return on assets, a measure of bank earnings, was higher and rose
further at Midwest farm banks in the third quarter than at
non-agricultural banks, it said. Farm banks are lending institutions
with agricultural loans, other than real estate loans secured by
farmland, exceeding 30 percent of their total loans.
   Midwest farm banks had a return on assets of 1.02 percent in the
third quarter, or $1.02 for each $100 in assets. That was up 28
cents from a year earlier. Returns at non-agricultural banks in the
Midwest were 99 cents for each $100 in assets, a rise of 7 cents
from the third quarter of 1987, the report said.
   ``Certainly most analysts had forecast earnings under 1 percent''
of assets for farm banks when the drought first struck, Gregorash
said.
   The Chicago Fed attributed the improved earnings at Midwest farm
banks to a drop in problem loans. Provisions for loan losses fell 30
hundredths of a percentage point to 0.36 percent of assets at
Midwest farm banks, while at non-agricultural banks, provisions for
loan losses dipped 8 hundredths of a percentage point to 0.47
percent of assets, the report said.
   The percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans for Midwest
ag banks fell from 4.41 percent a year earlier and 3.02 percent in
the second quarter to 2.91 percent in third quarter of 1988. At
non-agricultural banks, the percentage of nonperforming loans dipped
just 0.41 point from a year earlier and 0.08 point from the second
quarter to reach 2.11 percent of total loans.
   The figures on Midwest farm banks covered districts supervised by
Federal Reserve Banks in Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis and Kansas
City, Mo.
   States either entirely or partially in those districts are
Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New
Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Wisconsin
and Wyoming.
   ``As the Midwest sustained its turnaround, the distress continued
in the Southwest, driven by extremely high provisions'' for bad
loans, the report said. ``As a result of poor credit quality, loan
loss provisions as a percent of average assets were 2.54 percent in
the third quarter (in the Southwest), up from 1.42 percent a year
ago and 2.36 percent in the second quarter of 1988.''

<HEAD>Boeing Unions: Just Bad Luck For Planemaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials at The Boeing Co.'s two major unions say
they haven't heard their members complain about quality slipping at
the planebuilder, and are hard-pressed to attribute a recent spate
of bad news to anything but bad luck.
   ``I don't understand how it could happen,'' said Dan Mahoney,
general counsel for the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association, which represents about 26,000 Boeing engineers and
technical workers. ``Everybody realizes this company survives on
airplanes that stay in the air. There's no effort we're aware of to
skimp on testing and quality assurance.''
   Despite recent news accounts of some quality complaints by Boeing
workers, Mahoney and Jack Daniels, spokesman for International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 751, said the
complaints hadn't reached them.
   ``I haven't heard of anything,'' Daniels said, adding if any of
the 40,000 Boeing production workers had a complaint, they could
report it through their union shop stewards or business
representives.
   ``All our members are concerned about quality,'' said Daniels.
``But we haven't seen any evidence that quality has slipped.''
   In 1988, Boeing smashed industry records for new commercial jets
ordered, 636 planes worth about $29.7 billion.
   It introduced the 737-400, a stretch twinjet, and the 747-400,
the world's largest commercial jetliner. It worked on a new, smaller
version of the 737, the model-500, due out this spring, and
announced it was increasing aircraft production across the board
during the next few years.
   But 1988 also was the year safety of older aircraft became a
worry, sparked by a terrifying accident in which an Aloha Airlines
737-200 lost part of its roof over Hawaii.
   Several airlines also criticized Boeing for poor workmanship.
Boeing executives said the work would be improved, and the four
carriers whose complaints were publicized later placed sizeable
orders for Boeing planes.
   In recent weeks, however, little news has been good for Boeing.
   _The disintegration of a Pan Am 747 over Scotland on Dec. 21,
killing 270, was ultimately blamed on a bomb, but not before
speculation that the 19-year-old plane might have failed.
   _On Dec. 26, an older Eastern 727 made an unscheduled landing
after it lost cabin pressure when a hole opened in the fuselage.
   _On Jan. 8, a 12-week-old British Midlands 737-400 crashed in
Great Britain after one engine failed and the other was shut off.
Cross-wiring in engine warnings systems was being investigated, but
no incidences of cross-wiring in 737s have been reported.
   _Cross-wiring was found in cargo-hold fire extinguishing systems
on seven Boeing 757s, after the Federal Aviation Administration
ordered a check. On Friday, the FAA also ordered the systems checked
on Boeing 767s because of the similarity of design.
   _In the past week, an engine fell off a Piedmont Boeing 737-200,
which still landed safely in Chicago, and a wing panel came off an
Eastern Boeing 757. Neither incident resulted in injuries.
   _Last Friday, Boeing announced it had completed a five-day
``readjustment'' of its 747-400 line to catch up work in some
places, and once again was reviewing its already-delayed schedule
for delivering the new planes. Initial customers Northwest and
Singapore airlines both said they were disappointed and need to get
the new planes as soon as possible.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Dean Thornton has
acknowledged rapid growth has meant too many inexperienced workers
and too much overtime. Boeing now employs more than 95,000 in
Washington, 55,000 in Commercial Airplanes alone.
   But Bill Whitlow Jr., analyst with Dain Bosworth Co. in Seattle,
said Boeing's woes are ``short-term blemishes on their reputation.''
   Boeing set a tight schedule for developing the 747-400, getting
it certified and getting production up to what analysts estimate
will be 55 to 60 planes in 1989, Whitlow said. ``They're just trying
to get too much done too quickly,'' he said.
   Some 60 percent of all commercial jets flying were built by
Boeing,said Phil Friedman, an analyst with Drexell Burnham Lambert
in New York.
   ``Boeing's market share is such that whenever a plane goes down,
the chances are good their name is going to be on it,'' he said.
   Friedman also said Boeing's problems are short-term. If not,
``Why did they have the blockbuster year that they did? Customers
putting up money is the best sign they're convinced that quality is
as good as it ever was.''
   ``It's sort of an unfortunate, random confluence of events,''
Mahoney said. ``When you think of how many airplanes there are
taking off and landing every minute of the day, it's one of those
things.''

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Lorrilard Inc., one of the
tobacco companies sued in the landmark Cipollone cigarette liability
trial, can't interview jurors from that case, the trial judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin rejected Lorillard's request
at a hearing Monday. Sarokin agreed with attorneys for Antonio
Cipollone, who said not enough reason existed to depart from federal
rules in New Jersey which only allow such interviews for ``good
cause.''
   Most of the exceptions involve cases in which there was evidence
of jury tampering or interference. Lorillard made no such
allegation, saying it only wanted to speak to the jurors ``to
discuss their impressions of the case'' for purposes of
``self-education,'' according to court papers.
   The company said it would make sure no juror would be harassed,
and that they would be told they could stop the interview at any
time. Lorillard noted that some jurors had spoken freely to
reporters, and included copies of news articles in their court
documents.
   ``Certainly in a case of this importance, the court can
understand the self-education motivation of counsel,'' Sarokin said,
adding that the reason was not enough to depart from the rules.
   In June, a six-member jury awarded Cipollone $400,000 in damages,
finding that Liggett Group Inc. violated advertising promises that
its products were safe. Liggett made the cigarettes smoked by
Cipollone's wife, Rose, before warning labels were put on packs in
1966.
   The Cipollone verdict was the first to award money damages,
though it awarded them to Cipollone only and not on behalf of his
wife. Liggett has appealed.
   Damages were assessed only against Liggett. Liggett, Philip
Morris Inc. and Lorillard were cleared of conspiring to misrepresent
the dangers of smoking and other claims.
   Mrs. Cipollone smoked for 40 years before dying in 1984 at age 58.
   The cigarette industry spends millions of dollars defending
itself against hundreds of smoker-liability cases and waged a
large-scale public relations campaign during the trial.
   ``Lorillard states categorically that no information it obtains
from the Cipollone trial jurors will be used in any way in
connection with the pending appeal of the Cipollone judgment,''
their court papers said.
   Lorillard also said no information from juror interviews ``will
be used for any sort of public relations campaign or purpose.''
   Three jurors told The Philadelphia Inquirer that they compromised
into agreeing to award the damages to Cipollone because two jurors
insisted on finding the tobacco companies at fault.
   ``As I look back on it today, I don't think I did the right
thing,'' said jury forewoman Marie Mickens in the newspaper's Sept.
4 edition. ``I hope they (Liggett) win on appeal.''
   Cipollone's attorney, Alan M. Darnell, argued that if wanting to
learn about how a jury worked was enough to allow juror interviews,
``then applications to interview jurors would be routinely granted,
because lawyers and parties are always curious about what `really'
happened in the jury room.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in early European trading today and
foreign currency dealers said they expected it to trade within a
narrow range for the remainder of the session.
   Gold prices were little changed.
   Traders said the dollar fell sharply overnight following another
round of central bank intervention Monday afternoon and a statement
by Bundesbank Director Leonhard Gleske that West Germany would
prefer to see the dollar below 1.80 marks.
   ``The market is trying to see whether the dollar has reached its
minimum levels for now or whether it should fall further to 1.80
marks,'' said one trader in Rome.
   ``People's confidence in the dollar has been shaken,'' said a
dealer at a major West German bank in Frankfurt. ``They're nervous
and uncertain.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.25 yen to a closing 126.95. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 126.55 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8234 West German marks, down from 1.8385; 1.5438
Swiss francs, down from 1.5577; 6.2050 French francs, down from
6.2545; 2.0571 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0780; 1,336.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,353.00; 1.1855 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1888.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7813, more expensive for
buyers than $1.7733 Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $407.30 a troy ounce,
down from $407.75 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $407.80.
   The bid price was also $407.80 an ounce in Zurich, up from
$407.40 bid late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 16 cents to close at a bid
$408.99.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.19 a troy ounce,
down marginally from Monday's $6.20.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Japanese Stocks Set New Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar plunged from its recent relatively high
levels against the Japanese yen today, while the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's leading index climbed to another record.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 162.50-point gainer Monday,
rose another 224.80 points, or 0.72 percent, closing at 31,557.68, a
new high.
   Foreign exchange rate stability and a downtrend in oil prices and
short-term interest rates boosted Japanese investors' buying
interest, said an analyst with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest
brokerage.
   ``The yen's strength contributed most in the Nikkei's sharp rise
today,'' he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In active trading, with first section volume estimated at 1.3
billion shares, steel, real estate and financial issues attracted
buyers.
   On the currency exchange market, the dollar finished at 126.95
yen, down 1.25 yen from Monday's 128.20 yen close. The currency
opened at 127.37 yen and ranged between 126.70 and 127.55 yen.
   The dollar had climbed to a closing of 129.20 yen last Thursday,
up more than six yen from its mid-December level.
   A Bank of Tokyo dealer said concerted dollar-selling intervention
by U.S. and European central banks for the last four days
effectively brought the dollar down. Dealers said its low opening in
Tokyo today followed a decline on overseas markets overnight.
   In quiet trading, Japanese market players made only some
technical adjustments after the dollar's rally last week, said a
dealer with Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Investors were intermittently selling and buying the currency
for speculative purposes as the dollar-yen rate moved,'' said the
dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Sudden Acceleration Alleged in Cadillacs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group's allegation that 1.1 million
Cadillacs may be prone to sudden acceleration runs counter to the
findings of earlier government investigations, General Motors Corp.
says.
   The Center for Auto Safety, in a petition filed Monday with the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, asked the agency to
order the recall of Cadillacs with HT-4100 4.1-liter V8 engines and
made from 1982 through 1988.
   GM responded that a 1986 NHTSA investigation of GM vehicles,
including Cadillacs, failed to find ``a common design flaw or
manufacturing defect that could be a root cause for these unwanted
acceleration incidents.''
   ``If the center has any technical information that would shed
light on these incidents, we would certainly like to see it,'' said
Vince Muniga, a spokesman for GM's Cadillac Division in Detroit.
   The center based its petition on public complaints of 120
instances of unintended acceleration that allegedly resulted in 63
accidents, 70 injuries and five deaths.
   Two of the fatalities occurred in November when a 1985 Cadillac
Eldorado crashed through the front of a department store in
Belleville, N.J., killing two shoppers and injuring 13.
   ``Victims in many of these cases are pedestrians or bystanders
unable to dodge an out-of-control Cadillac,'' the center said in its
petition.
   NHTSA said it would respond to the center's request within 120
days and declined to comment further on the petition.
   GM said it would cooperate with any NHTSA investigation of the
allegations.
   NHTSA, in response to an earlier petition by the center, has been
investigating allegations of sudden acceleration in
front-wheel-drive Cadillac DeVilles and Fleetwoods made from 1985
through 1988.
   The models included in the center's latest petition are the
1982-1984 DeVilles and Fleetwoods; 1982-1987 Eldorados, Sevilles,
Broughams and Fleetwood Broughams; and 1987-1988 Allantes.
   Federal engineers in recent years have investigated allegations
of sudden acceleration in about 80 million vehicles produced by 10
manufacturers, according to figures compiled by the center.
   About 440,000 cars were recalled as a result of the
investigations, the center said.

<HEAD>Some Contractors Worry About Going Broke After Supreme Court Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civic leaders lamented a U.S. Supreme Court
decision to strike down Richmond's minority set-aside ordinance, and
at least one minority contractor said his business won't survive the
ruling.
   Merlin Hargrove said the city law, which required at least 30
percent of any city contract to be subcontracted to minority-owned
businesses, meant $400,000 in business over four years for his
United Unlimited Construction Co.
   He said Monday's ruling will mean the end of his company, which
employs nine people.
   ``I was expecting it to go the other way,'' he said of the
ruling. ``I guess the only thing you can do is pray.''
   Dwight Snead, another minority contractor, said his landscaping
and paving business will survive, but only because the ordinance got
it started. The law was enacted in 1983 and suspended in 1987
pending the outcome of the Supreme Court's ruling.
   Snead said he never got city work before the set-aside law was
enacted. Since then, he said, he's received several million dollars
in subcontracts on city projects and his company has grown from 10
employees to 60.
   The ordinance ``enabled us to become a general contractor,'' said
Snead.
   Many city leaders were critical of the court's ruling, which said
the ordinance amounted to ``reverse discrimination.''
   The decision marks ``a dark day for the city, a dark day for the
country and a dark day for human relations,'' Councilman Roy A. West
said.
   ``I'm keenly disappointed in the decision,'' Councilman Henry L.
Marsh III said. ``But I think we have to regroup in Richmond and
make an attempt to comply with the Supreme Court requirements.''
   One voice of praise for the court came from Councilwoman Carolyn
C. Wake, who voted against the ordinance in 1983.
   ``I feel that justice has prevailed,'' she said, ``because I
believe very much in the marketplace and the free enterprise
system.''
   Councilman Chuck Richardson called the court's decision ``weak,
superficial, superfluous and an excuse. ... For the court to hide
behind the feeble excuse that there was no evidence (of
discrimination) was almost unconscionable.''
   Richardson said blacks received less than 1 percent of all
contracts before the ordinance. Forty percent of all contracts went
to minority-owned companies during the life of the ordinance,
according to City Manager Robert Bobb.
   The ordinance was challenged in 1987 by J.A. Croson Co., an Ohio
company that was the only bidder on a city project but failed to get
the job because it lacked a minority subcontractor.

<HEAD>Catholic College To Shut Down At End Of June</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALINA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marymount College has given up efforts to
stay open amid financial problems and will close June 30, officials
announced.
   Students, faculty and staff were told the news at a private
meeting Monday. Some emerged from the session in tears, and one
student later played taps on the front steps of the administration
building.
   The college, founded in September 1922 by the Sisters of St.
Joseph of Concordia, was for women only until 1967. The Roman
Catholic Diocese of Salina took over the school in 1983, in a move
intended to broaden the college's base of financial support and
enrollment.
   The Most Rev. George Fitzsimons, bishop of the diocese, said the
primary reason for the closing was financial.
   The college, which has debt of about $1.2 million, began a $4.8
million fund-raising drive in October. Joe Wedding, who stepped down
Friday as executive director of institutional advancement for
Marymount, said donations had stalled at $2 million. About half of
that total came from the diocese.
   Marymount had seen enrollment decline slowly but steadily. It had
877 students in 1977. Last fall, it enrolled 653 students, up
slightly from the 644 of the previous year. About 350 of the
students are full-time.
   The bishop said Marymount will invite student and faculty
recruiters from other colleges to visit the campus throughout the
spring term. The college has about 120 faculty, staff and
administrators.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan plans to develop an ocean freighter capable of
sailing more than twice as fast as container vessels now in
operation, a government official said Tuesday.
   The planned vessel, to be about 330 feet long and capable of
carrying more than 1,000 tons, would travel to the United States in
about three days, or about half the time needed now for ocean
crossings, said Tasuku Hirahara of the Transport Ministry's
Technology Division
   Hirahara said 546 million yen, or $4.3 million, has been
earmarked for the project in the fiscal year beginning April 1. The
budget still is subject to approval by parliament. The project is
expected to take about five years.
   The vessel would have a speed of more than 50 knots, or 93
kilometers an hour, compared with the average speed of 20 knots of
current container vessels, Hirahara said.
   It also would travel between Japan and the newly industrializing
Asian nations and territories of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and
Hong Kong.
   The official said the first of the new commercial liners, needing
fewer than 10 crew members, would be operating before the end of
this century.
   Shippers hope for a liner that would let them keep shipping
charges to about one-tenth those charged for air freight, Hirahara
said.

<HEAD>Rates Fall on Short-Term Treasuries In Monday's Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in the government's latest auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 8.26 percent on Monday, down from 8.30
percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 8.31 percent, down from 8.35 percent
last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 8.24
percent on Jan. 3, and six-month bills averaged 8.29 percent on Dec.
19.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.55 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,791.20 and 8.79 percent for six-month bills selling for $9,579.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for 1-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for
making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, fell to 8.96
percent last week after averaging 9.11 percent the week before.

<HEAD>Texaco Agrees to Accept Fund Nominee To Board Of Directors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. has bowed to the wishes of
some of its biggest institutional stockholders by agreeing to
appoint the president of New York University to its board of
directors.
   John Brademas, 61, who has been NYU's president since 1981, was
one of 14 people that a group of big pension funds had asked Texaco
to consider as a nominee to the board.
   Texaco on Monday announced the appointment of Brademas, who will
join the board later this month, and Charles H. Price, 58, who will
join in March after completing a 6-year tenure as ambassador to
Britain.
   Texaco's agreement to accept the funds' nominee was described as
a landmark in the struggle over who runs corporations.
   The selection of a fund-backed director ``is a watershed
development,'' W. Gordon Binns Jr., head of General Motors Corp.'s
pension fund, the nation's largest private fund, told the Wall
Street Journal.
   ``It means (some public) institutional investors ... want to go
beyond just voting proxies and take a direct hand in corporate
governance.''
   The appointments come during the final stages of a massive
restructuring since the oil giant emerged from bankruptcy protection
last year and during a battle with disgruntled shareholders led by
financier Carl C. Icahn.
   Price previously was ambassador to Belgium for two years, and
chairman of American Bancorp, president of American Bank and Trust
Co., and chairman of Price Candy Co., all of Kansas City, Mo.
   Before joining NYU, Brademas served 11 terms as an Indiana
congressman.
   The moves expand the board size to 15 from 14. Texaco said Lorene
L. Rogers, the retired president of the University of Texas at
Austin, was retiring from the board after 13 years.
   Texaco has made major changes over the last year, selling off
major assets, reorganizing internally and shifting its focus to
exploration and production from refining and marketing.
   But Texaco has been fored to fight Icahn, its largest
shareholder, who has been pushing Texaco to boost the value of the
company's stock by selling off assets.
   Icahn last week indicated he might try for a second time to wrest
control of Texaco's board from management at the May shareholders
meeting. Icahn also has indicated in the past he might mount a
buyout bid for the oil giant.
   Texaco is the nation's third-largest oil company behind Exxon
Corp. and Mobil Corp.

<TEXT>
   A Falmouth bank is offering a $5,000 reward
to anyone who can provide a tip that helps bring a factory with more
than 50 employees to job-starved Pendleton County in rural northern
Kentucky.
   The First National Bank is offering the bounty in hopes of luring
an employer to the county, where the annual unemployment rate was
9.6 percent in 1987, the latest year for which that figure is
available. The county is home to an estimated 11,300 people.
   Tracy Farmer, a former Kentucky Democratic Party chairman and
aide to former Kentucky Gov. John Y. Brown Jr., owns the bank and
initiated the reward.
   ``This is an ideal place for a factory. We have good labor, it's
a good area, improvements on U.S. 27 are beneficial and the
industrial foundation has been doing a good job,'' Farmer said. The
foundation is a group of the county's business leaders.
   Warren Shonert, the bank's vice president for public and
community relations, said the reward offer expires April 1.
   ``Mr. Farmer is always interested in economic development and
thought maybe this would help bring a new industry to Pendleton
County,'' Shonert said. ``He doesn't care where it locates, just so
it is in the county.''
   David Butcher, past president of the Pendleton County Chamber of
Commerce, said the county hopes to attract an employer that would
hire women. He said this could help increase the standard of living
for families, by providing jobs for wives.
   ``That would increase the family's standard of living
considerably,'' Butcher said.
   Pendleton County's per capita income for 1986, the latest
available, was $9,443, compared with the state per capita of
$11,268, said Ron Decker, economic development representative with
the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development.
   Pendleton County's largest manufacturer is the Fuller
Manufacturing and Supply Co. in Falmouth, which employs about 150
people.

positively to our request for discussion of a fair share agreement.''
   The Fair Share Program, in effect since 1982, is aimed at
expanding opportunities for minorities.
   General Motors Corp. earlier signed a fair share agreement with
the NAACP, and Ford Motor Co. signed a similar agreement in Chicago.

   Prices moved higher on Wall Street today as
buyers took advantage of bargain stock prices following Monday's
decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 7.15 to 2,225.54

   Jack Garry, a market analyst with Butcher &amp; Singer Inc. in

   The lower prices gave bargain hunters an opportunity to enter the

   Strength in the dollar and Treasury bond prices also boosted the
stock market today.
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was RJR Nabisco, which

dividends as a means of discouraging debt-financed corporate
takeovers.
   He acknowledged, however, that efforts to cut the federal budget
deficit made that an unlikely prospect.
   Brady opposed eliminating the tax breaks on so-called junk bonds
that are financing the multibillion-dollar takeovers. But he said
the government may have no other choice if financiers do not ``put
the same intensity and effort into evaluating where we are going s
they have into taking us there.''
   The Treasury secretary, testifying before the Senate Finance
Committee, said eliminating the tax deductions for interest paid on
junk bonds ``would simply increase the cost of capital for American
acquirers by effectively raising their interest rates ....''
   ``The net effect would be a competitive disadvantage for U.S.
corporations,'' he said.
   Instead, Brady urged Congress to look at effectively reducing
taxes on dividends. He said West Germany, Italy, Australia and New
Zealand give shareholders credit for taxes paid by corporations
before dividends are distributed.
   ``I recognize that at this juncture revenue considerations limit
our ability to provide fundamental relief from double taxation of
corporate income,'' on both the corporations and their stockholders,
Brady said.
   The Treasury secretary appeared to contradict a statement earlier
by Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David Ruder that the
debt-financed takeovers, known as leveraged buyouts or LBOs, do not
pose a problem for the U.S. economy.
   Brady has called the use of junk bonds in corporate takeovers a
``dangerous destabilizing element ... largely dedicated to
unproductive purposes,'' and he expanded on that view today.
   ``I have a growing feeling that we are headed in the wrong
direction when so much of our young talent and the nation's
financial resources are aimed at financial engineering while the
rest of the world is laying the foundation for the future,'' he said.
   Brady said the total value of leveraged buyouts has increased
from around $11 billion in the five-year period from 1978 to 1983 to
more than $160 billion in the past five years, including $60 billion
in 1988 alone.
   A contributing factor in the proliferation of leveraged buyouts,
he said, is the up-front fees collected by banks, underwriters and
fund managers in the transactions.
   At the same time, the companies acquired through the leveraged
buyouts often lack the cash flow to keep up with the interest
payments on junk bonds.
   ``Sadly, these same parties may have relatively little, if any,
investment in the long-term success of the new enterprise,'' Brady
said. ``Given this arrangement, it may very well be that the net
effect of LBOs is a financial snipe hunt, where the new long-term
investors, flashlight in hand, are left holding the bag.''
   In contrast, the SEC's Ruder said on ``CBS This Morning'' earlier
today that he thought LBOs ``will increase ownership by management
and will make us a more productive country.''
   ``I mean by that that after these buyouts, the managers of the
divisions typically will be allowed to run the divisions without
having to be overseen by the top management of the large
conglomerate, and they may be very much more efficient in their
management when they're on their own,'' he said.
   President Bush, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and at
least a half-dozen congressional committees all are worried about
corporate America's debt binge of takeovers financed with
high-interest junk bonds.
   The new administration already is under pressure to come up with
proposals to curb the buyouts.
   Some economists worry that during a recession, highly leveraged
companies would not have enough cash flow to keep up their interest
payments to junk bond holders and other creditors and might pull
other companies down with them.
   ``One could imagine that a company would get caught with a high
level of debt during the period before they've had a chance to
refinance,'' Ruder said. ``But that would only be one company or two
companies and would not be a threat to the economy.''
   Since last fall Brady has had a team at the Treasury Department
looking at whether the tax laws are encouraging companies to finance
their expansions through debt rather than stock equity. The group
also has tried to determine corporate vulnerability in the event of
an economic downturn.
   The Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means committees last
week issued a report showing that corporate debt has climbed by $613
billion in the past five years while ownership equity has declined
by $313 billion.
   The report also said that the ratio of debt to equity in
non-financial corporations has climbed from 30 percent to 46 percent
from 1981 to 1987.
   Fears about the vulnerability of highly leveraged companies were
heightened last September when Revco D.S. Inc., the Cleveland-based
drug store chain, entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings after
defaulting on $700 million in bonds following a buyout.
   Despite the continuing booming economy, bankruptcies continue to
climb _ from 51 large companies defaulting on $11 billion in debt in
1984 to 87 companies defaulting on $21.4 billion in 1987.
   ``I think there's an appetite here to do something,'' Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means
panel, told reporters last week. ``Something really should be done,
particularly when we're seeing the junk bond abuse.''
   Bush two weeks ago ruled out direct government action to curtail
the new tide of takeovers _ most of them financed by borrowing huge
amounts of money against the assets of the company being acquired
through high-yield junk bonds.
   But he left open the possibility of changing the way the tax laws
treat stock dividends and the deductibility of interest payments on
debt used to finance takeovers.
   ``There are things you can do in the tax laws,'' he said. ``If
there are abuses of our tax laws ... the whole tax law will be
reviewed to see how they can be eliminated.''
   Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, also has urged Congress to take a
new look at how the tax laws encourage corporate debt and discourage
equity.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of soybeans and corn were higher
while wheat futures were lower in early trading today on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Talk of Soviet purchases of U.S. soymeal and higher prices on the
European soymeal spot market drove soybean prices much higher, said
Steve Freed, grain analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Traders said corn futures followed the advance in soybeans, but
the rally was restrained by reports of a new Agriculture Department
catalog of corn next week that would provide an avenue for more spot
sales, Freed said.
   Wheat prices were depressed by a forecast for showers in growing
areas of the U.S. winter wheat crop, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2} cents to 3} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in Martch at $4.41 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
to 2\ cents higher with March at $2.72{ a bushel; oats were \ cent
lower to 3 cents higher with March at $2.39 a bushel; and soybeans
were 3 cents to 9{ cents higher with March at $7.65 a bushel.
   Futures prices for livestock and meat were mostly higher on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, live cattle were .05 cent lower to .28 cent
higher with the contract for delivery in February at 72.80 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .30 cent higher with
January at 83.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower to .05
cent higher with February at 43.35 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .47 cent lower to .30 cent higher with February at
39.70 cents a pound.
   On Monday, livestock and meat prices traded mostly lower.

<HEAD>U.S. Firm: 1992 Too Soon For Unified European Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading U.S. accounting firm said it
was doubtful the European Economic Community could achieve a single
capital market by 1992.
   Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. of Chicago said Tuesday that serious
problems in harmonizing regulations, taxes and technology among the
countries would prevent integration of the 12-nation trading bloc on
schedule.
   ``An integrated European capital market, with a common
infrastructure, will not be achieved by 1992,'' a report by the Big
Eight accounting firm said. ``A longer timetable is needed.''
   The EEC wants to create a single, European-wide market by the end
of 1992. To meet that goal, the Common Market nations are in the
process of dismantling barriers to the movement of capital, goods
and people among the member states.
   About 80 percent of the 1,000 experts from 13 countries who took
part in the study predicted that international equity trading will
remain concentrated in London, Tokyo and New York, but the European
exchange may lose some importance.
   ``London will play a significant role in the international
market, but even its ability to compete with Tokyo and New York is
far from certain,'' it said.
   The report predicted that assets managed by European
institutional investors would double in the next five years but said
savers would demand more sophisticated investment instruments.
   The study said European exchanges will have to cooperate rather
than compete in order to handle the increased and more demanding
business. It also predicted gaps among Common Market countries as
some remove regulations from their markets faster than others.

   Amid reports that a government investigation of
Chicago commodity markets was expanding, the head of the agency that
oversees the markets said the probe should not shake investor
confidence.
   ``I think this is a very good example of how we're doing in our
job,'' said Wendy Gramm, chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.
   John Troelstrup, a Chicago attorney representing at least one of
the traders subpoenaed, told The Associated Press he understood the
grand jury would meet today and Wednesday.
   The New York Times reported today that at least a dozen more
subpoenas were delivered to Chicago traders Monday and some people
could appear today before a grand jury.
   The Chicago Sun-Times reported that unidentified sources said the
FBI has asked the Internal Revenue Service to conduct ``net worth''
investigations of some brokers and traders suspected of evading
large amounts of taxes.
   The Sun-Times also said the suspects are believed to be
frantically trying to shift assets to relatives and business
associates to hide unreported profits.
   U.S. law enforcement officials are investigating allegations that
as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customers
out of millions of dollars on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Since last week's revelations, FBI agents and U.S. prosecutors in
Chicago have said nothing for the record, but on Monday in
Washington, Ms. Gramm acknowledged her agency has been involved in
the investigation from the outset.
   Ms. Gramm declined to say whether the CFTC simply had been
informed of the probe or had assigned personnel to it from the
start. Nor would she say whether the agency knew that undercover FBI
agents were operating on the floors of the exchanges and whether
CFTC records have been subpoenaed.
   Asked if the revelations should shake investor confidence in the
futures markets, Ms. Gramm said: ``The fact that we bring cases ...
to root out fraud and abuse is an example of why people should be
confident in our ability to police the markets.''
   FBI agents posing as traders recorded conversations about the
alleged fraud at the exchanges, and the government has subpoenaed
traders and trading records dating back to Jan. 1, 1983.
   The investigation has raised jitters among many traders and
sparked a rash of seat sales on the major exchanges. Six more seats
were sold on both exchanges by the close of business Monday,
bringing to 32 the total number sold since the probe went public
Thursday.
   The Merc's board of governors issued a letter urging traders
``not to be driven to irrational or self-destructive behavior by the
adverse publicity.''
   ``Our own internal compliance department had already focused on
many of the same practices that appear to be central to the federal
investigation,'' the letter read.
   ``We will deal harshly with violators. We stand ready to revise
rules and enforce procedures where necessary.''
   The Chicago Tribune reported today that the FBI paid between $1
million and $2 million to secretly buy three seats on the exchanges,
lease a fourth seat, deposit $200,000 with firms that processed the
agents' trades and stake the agents to trading capital.

   Commerce Secretary-designate Robert Mosbacher
said today the United States is lagging in the global race to
develop a new generation of television sets, and he promised to help
U.S. manufacturers compete in this and other high-technology fields.
   Mosbacher told the Senate Commerce Committee at his confirmation
hearing that he was concerned that U.S. manufacturers were losing
ground to foreign competitors in such areas as high-definition
television.
   Japan and other countries have been racing to develop the
technology for clearer TV pictures with the prize a
multibillion-dollar sales market for consumers worldwide.
   ``We are losing the advantage we started out with in the
high-technology area,'' Mosbacher said. ``It appears to me that
while it is very late in the game, it is not too late. We can get
back in the game.''
   Mosbacher said he did not have any specific recommendations to
make now but that this area would be a high priority once he took
office. He suggested there may be a need for new laws to waive
antitrust restrictions that would allow U.S. electronic companies to
work together in developing high-definition TV.
   ``A central challenge facing the Department of Commerce is to
support U.S. economic growth and international competitiveness,''
Mosbacher said in written testimony submitted earlier.
   ``To meet this challenge we must promote a better climate for
increased U.S. exports (and) help American industry develop and
apply new commercial technologies that will make us more
competitive.''
   Mosbacher was praised by many members of the committee and he was
expected to have no trouble winning confirmation.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, introduced Mosbacher, a wealthy
Texas oilman and longtime friend of President Bush, to the committee
as a ``friend, counselor, tough competitor and an international
businessman.''
   Bentsen, who was the Democratic vice presidential candidate and
was often critical of the Reagan administration's stance on trade,
said he believed Mosbacher exemplified a new activism that Bush
promised in his inaugural address last Friday.
   Committee Chairman Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., noted that the
Republican National Committee released on Monday a list of 249
individuals and corporate representatives who gave at least $100,000
to the Bush cause.
   Common Cause, a citizen activist group, had urged the Commerce
Committee to delay Mosbacher's confirmation until the list was made
public. Mosbacher, Bush's campaign finance chairman, raised more
than $25 million in large donations.
   Hollings said that while the list of people willing to give
$100,000 and more showed the need for limits on such contributions,
he was satisfied with publication of the list and did not feel the
issue would hold up Mosbacher's confirmation.
   Among the goals Mosbacher cited in his Cabinet job were expanding
U.S. trade, supporting research and development, working to clean up
coastal pollution and ensuring that next year's census was conducted
fairly and accurately.
   Mosbacher, one of four Texans named to the Bush Cabinet, has a
background very similar to the new president. Both were born to
wealthy Northeast families and went to Texas after World War II to
make their fortunes in the oil business.
   Mosbacher proved to be more successful than Bush, amassing a net
worth reportedly topping $200 million as the head of Mosbacher
Energy Co. of Houston, an energy development company with leases
along the Gulf Coast from Texas to Alabama and in the Rocky Montains.
   Mosbacher, whose fortune makes him the wealthiest member of the
incoming Cabinet, cuts a dashing figure in a generally staid group
of Bush appointees.
   He is an accomplished sailor who has won several international
yachting championships and his third wife, Georgette, is a former
model who has already made a big splash on the Washington social
scene.
   Bush and Mosbacher became friends in the early 1960s with
Mosbacher often serving as a fund raiser for Bush's political
efforts. Mosbacher was chief fund raiser for Bush's 1980 and 1988
presidential campaigns and performed the same job for President
Ford's 1976 campaign.
   Mosbacher and Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady became known as the ``Big Three''
during Bush's presidential bid last year, the three senior campaign
advisers to whom Bush turned most often for advice.
   Because Mosbacher is one of Bush's oldest friends, many expect
Mosbacher to play a more influential role in setting economic policy
than previous Commerce secretaries.
   In announcing the nomination last month, Bush said that Mosbacher
would bring his ``tremendous energies to promoting U.S. exports
abroad.''
   While administration of U.S. trade policy is considered the
department's most vital role, especially in an era of record trade
deficits, the far-flung agency also is home to the Census Bureau,
the National Weather Service and the Bureau of Economic Analysis,
which produces many of the government's statistical reports.
   It is in the trade area, however, where Mosbacher will likely
devote most of his energies. While the trade deficit has improved
after hitting an all-time high of $170.1 billion in 1987, many
economists fear the improvement is in danger of stalling out unless
the new administration proves more successful than the Reagan
administration in removing foreign barriers to U.S. products.
   The United States is currently fighting a ban imposed by the
12-nation European Community on American beef treated with hormones.
The Reagan administration on Jan. 1 began implementing $100 million
in trade sanctions against European products in retaliation for the
European decision to ban hormone-treated beef.

   Seated at a terminal in the computer lab at the University of
California-Berkeley, Jef (one `f' has been sacrificed for aesthetic
purity) Poskanzer, a longhair of 30 years, is poised like Vladimir
Horowitz about to bring magic from a keyboard.
   Plockety-plock-plock. Suddenly on the screen appears a detailed
portrait of the Earth's moon. Every 20 minutes throughout the 28-day
lunar cycle the portrait changes to update the sunlight's
progression from fingernail sliver to complete illumination at full
moon. Jef programmed the computer to do this during several nights
when the machines usually doze.
   Neat.
   But why did Jef do this? For about the same reasons that
Michelangelo painted ceiling, Columbus went sailing or
Hillary-Tenzing worried up the ice of Mount Everest.
   ``What use is a newborn baby?'' replied Ben Franklin when a
rain-soaked fellow onlooker asked him in Paris in 1783 what possible
purpose Jacques-Alexandre-Cesar Charles could have had in mind in
launching a huge balloon up into the clouds.
   Poskanzer's moon is an intellectual descendant of that balloon
and is, in the purest sense of the term, a hack.

   Hacking can be called an attitude toward problem solving, a human
urge to outwit conventional wisdom, an exploration of limits, not
always absent _ whimsy.
   When Caltech students at the 1961 Rose Bowl rearranged the code
of the cheering section's half-time show so their synchronized cards
spelled ``CALTECH'' instead of ``HUSKIES'' for the University of
Washington, then spelled Huskies backward, this was a hack.
   Since Robert Morris, a 23-year-old Cornell grad student, was
strongly suspected of planting a ``virus'' last fall _ actually a
``worm'' but don't bother your head about the distinction _ that
gave 6,000 interconnected computers electronic hits, hacking has
become a nasty word. Should it be?
   According to Steven Levy, the Herodotus of hacking in his
estimable history, ``Hackers,'' the word stems from MIT at the dawn
of the computer age in the late '50s. The incubator was the Tech
Model Railroad Club.
   In The Real World, defined by ``The Hacker's Dictionary'' as a
place whose inhabitants wear ties and are thought of as ``not unlike
deceased persons,'' hacking was how Henry VIII solved his marital
dissonances or what inept golfers or unfelicitous writers do.
   At MIT, where ingenious students had long since advanced from
reassembling Model A Fords in a professor's room, hacking at the
Railroad Club meant creating something of great panache and
ingenuity without necessarily an ultimate utility. Circuits could be
rewired not to make the tiny trains run on time, but to make them do
it more elegantly.
   When computers began showing up on campus, some railroaders were
immediately drawn to them like moths to a diode. They set behavior
patterns which abide. They lived by night when computers were idle,
neglected families, food, studies, sunlight, soap. The last may
account for the scarcity of female hackers.
   Early on, hackers, marked more by preoccupation than misogyny,
ignored girls because they considered them unprogrammable.
Poskanzer, however, backpacks, plays soccer and admits he has a girl.

   Gifted children have long been prodigies in music and math. Add,
now, computers.
   ``The young don't know there are walls,'' says Glenn Tenney who
is 39, still hacks but knows he must buy foodstuffs in The Real
World. ``It's easier to spend 40 hours a day hacking when you're a
kid than when you're middle-aged.''
   A hacking prodigy can be called, often unjustly, a nerd.
   The source of the term nerd is obscure. In a very informal poll,
the only characteristic a majority agreed on was that nerds usually
wear plastic pencil holders in their shirt pockets.
   In a lacrosse game, this writer once faced off against an MIT
defenseman whose stick was twice the length of mine. Rather than
snarl that he'd split my skull the next time the ref wasn't looking,
this student engineer observed:
   ``Quite a disparity in leverage, isn't it?''
   The remark was probably nerdistic.

   The hacking instinct in the years B.C. _ before computers _ might
have expressed itself in the souping of hot rods. But this is dirty
work. Computing is clean. There's a whole world at your fingertips.
You don't have to risk rejection when the neighborhood gang chooses
up sides for one o' cat.
   ``Years ago these kids would have been tipping over decrepit
barns or the like,'' says Don Parker, an authority on computer crime
at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif., and once an expert in
barn demolition. His childhood mates would almost saw through the
supports of an abandoned barn, tie on ropes, then collapse the
structure before the startled eyes of the owner roused from his bed
by the adolescent clamor. Delinquency, perhaps, but with a flair
toward a hack.
   ``Most kid hackers are not socially skilled,'' says Dave Flory.
``They socialize through the computer.''
   ``It's a way to nudge the system, impress your friends, say,
`Here I am,''' says Tom Mandel, a hacker who also wears a tie in The
Real World as a futurist at a Silicon Valley think tank.

   Dave Flory tracks down computer malfeasance as head of the fraud
squad for the San Jose police. Although 50, he hacks in his spare
time but was not amused when someone, possibly a nerd, filched his
password and ran up an $80 bill on his phone playing computer games
long distance.

   ``I was never popular, just a loner,'' Mark Duchaineau, a former
high school hacker, told Levy. ``You feel a oneness with the
computer. (Without it) there would have been this great void...like
you didn't have your sight or hearing.''
   ``There are a lot of bright kids, not socially well-developed,
who are miserable in junior high,'' says Mark Crispin, an author of
``The Hacker's Dictionary.'' ``They are naturally drawn to computer
hacking, something where they have complete control over the
results. Humans have basic needs and, if they don't get them out of
society, they'll get them elsewhere, and computers seem a better
answer than drugs.''

   Tenney is hacking in his basement in San Mateo. It looks like the
command module of a space capsule the morning after a Saturday night
linkup with some vodka-toasting Russkies:
   ``Computers are my hobby and my living. Hackers do it because
they enjoy it. That doesn't mean you can't think about money.''
   He speaks from experience with a wife and kids upstairs and a
diesel Cadillac with a blown head in the driveway. He programs
professionally to keep them respectively fueled.
   ``Hacking is the key to Silicon Valley. Woz (Steve Wozniak, the
legendary hacker who created the first Apple computer in a garage)
did it because he was interested in the challenge. Steve Jobs (Woz's
partner who turned the Apple into a multibillion-dollar orchard) saw
where it could go from the garage. That happens all the time out
here.'' A sum greater than its arts: synergy.
   ``If any company tells you they don't have any hackers on their
staff in the Valley, they're lying,'' says Leo Schwab, a young
hacker-programmer near San Rafael, Calif., a reputed wizard at
computer graphics.
   In hackerese, a wizard is a person permitted by the gods to do
things denied ordinary mortals.
   ``Hacking is a proud culture and rightly so,'' says Don Ingraham,
somewhat surprisingly since his job as assistant district attorney
for Alameda County (Oakland, Berkeley) is to track down computer bad
guys. ``These hackers working all night in their garages in Silicon
Valley and basements at MIT have pulled off miracles. They may well
be the salvation of our technology.''
   Japanese trains run on time but not because they've been hacked.
Nippon, collectively, makes great robots. America produces great
tinkerers, although a Japanese did ski down Everest, a most
celestial hack.

   Tenney is an anomaly, like a banana tree in Labrador. He emerged
not from the Valley or MIT but Chicago where hackers were ``computer
bums.'' By the time he was a high school senior, he had his own
office at the Illinois Institute of Technology. That was to make it
easier for him to tutor math teachers in computer familiarization
seminars, a child lecturing the pharisees at the temple.
   Even then something had evolved that Levy calls the Hacker Ethic.
This posited that access to computers and the data that fed them
should be free (keep in mind these were the '60s) and that hacking,
in and of itself and for the pure freedom of it, should be unimpeded
by the high priests of The Real World. Big Business. Big Brother.
Big Anybody. Computers promised a brave new world and all should
romp unhindered in Elysium.
   This has inevitably produced a gray, indeed very, very gray area
as to where hacking leaves off and the increasingly essential
networks of the nation's computers begin.

   He is called Captain Crunch, after the breakfast cereal. His real
name is John Draper.
   About 1970, while a soldier overseas, Draper found that the toy
whistle that came with each cereal box blew at 2,600 cycles, exactly
the pitch the phone company sang to. He began calling home _ free.
   Hacking Ma Bell became a challenge with electronic ``blue
boxes.'' Woz used to sell them dormitory-to-dormitory at Stanford.
(He could also arrange things so friends' computers would suddenly
light up with off-color Polish jokes.) You could ring up Sydney,
Australia, for nothing to get the Top Ten Tunes, try and give
Brezhnev a wakeup call.
   (Crunch, to whom Ingraham is a personal nemesis, finally went to
jail where he gave seminars to inmates on blue boxes. His back was
broken, Ingraham says, because his fellow cons felt he was
withholding technology. Draper, subsequently in the toils of the law
again, rigged Ingraham's computer to receive his legal bills.)
   Crunching _ and Morrising, if you will _ are deeds that have put
hacking in disrepute in The Real World. Stuart Brand, the
Californian who brought you ``The Whole Earth Catalog'' and now
provides a computer bulletin board in the Bay Area, is among many of
the old school who think everything, including copyrighted software,
should be free. But what of those, including numerous hackers, who
have devised brilliant software and then copyrighted it if only to
buy their groceries?
   ``When an artist produces art, he doesn't hang it in the
closet,'' Tenney reasons. ``He wants it to be seen.'' For nothing?
   ``A radical leftist hacker would say it's bad to let
establishment NCRs and IBMs use your stuff,'' says Poskanzer. ``A
radical leftit hacker would say you should not have sold it to IBM.
I say if they want to use it, fine. So I guess I'm a
middle-of-the-road hacker.''
   The Valley's annual Hacker Conference, which Tenney organizes and
Mandel attends as one of the 5 percent of ``necktie'' members
allowed to join, argues about free access at every meeting.
   Hackers agree the word ``hacking'' badly needs a euphemism. Their
fertile minds have added to the mother tongue such coinages as
gronk, to clear up, sort of; frobnicate, to adjust, as ``please
frobnicate the TV;'' dwim, forget it, move on to...; foo or bletch,
disgusting; moby foo, very disgusting; kluge, something that
shouldn't work but does; snarf, to snatch. But hackers have not come
up with a kinder, gentler term for what they do.

   There is, however, a term for hacking gone criminal: cracking.
Crunch, who made $1 million in The Real World as a
hacker-programmer, did hard time when he cracked.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   A world that found out about gravity when Newton hacked a falling
apple has to be tentative about curbing the curiosity of genius, two
sides of the same coin. There is a certain voyeurism to hacking.
(Ingraham thinks Crunch would have been a peeping Tom B.C.)
   Malcolm McNally, a retired nuclear engineer who has raised three
sons who have hacked, ceases pedaling his bike along Monterey Bay
long enough to consider why they did and why he approved.
   ``Say you're backpacking in the Sierras and see a `No
Trespassing' sign. You don't climb over the fence to start a forest
fire, but because you're curious about what's on the other side.''
   ``I like to crawl around inside things and see how they work and
on the way out make them work better,'' Mandel explained his
frobnication. ``Morris cracked. He did damage.''
   In the days of youth, hacking can become a compulsion, its
practitionersan obsessive brotherhood. The hacker's world shrinks
into the machine and blooms inside like a Chinese chrysanthemum
dropped into a water glass.
   Joseph Weizenbaum, a professor of computer science at MIT, writes
in his book, ``Computer Power and Human Reason'':
   ``...compulsive programming (hacking) represents a
psychopathology that is far less ambiguous than, say, milder forms
of schizophrenia or paranoia.''
   About 1980, a hacker at Stanford posted an anguished letter on
the bulletin board of the university's computer center. (The
dispensing machine had been computerized so you could charge food,
Cokes and beer. It was also programmed to refuse suds to minors.) In
the letter, `G. Gandalf' called computing ``highly addictive'' to
the point that ``very, very few hackers remain close to their
families. Very, very few associate with anyone who is not at least
partially a member of the hacking group...The most brilliant minds
at our top universities are learning how to play with
multimillion-dollar toys first and how to utilize them
constructively second...The hackers' motivation to challenge
themselves in any field not directly linked to computers gradually
disintegrates...This is what takes some of the brightest and most
capable minds in college today and turns them into narrowness.''
   `A. Anonymous' replied to Gandalf: ``A person who chooses to be a
musician must devote hours and hours to gain adequate expertise. But
would you consider the computer hacker any less creative than such a
person?''
   W.A. Mozart lived B.C. and couldn't answer.
   Crispin, a Stanford hacker in the time of Gandalf, used to talk
nationwide via electronic mail. (Hackers call the U.S. Postal
Service ``snail mail.'' Dave Flory thinks computer talk is
antiseptic, dehumanized. No inflection, no body language.) Lynn
Gold, a student at Columbia University in New York, thought ``there
was something about Crispin's messages. They were funny.''
   Eventually they arranged to meet in The Real World and got
married in it.
   ``Some hackers never grow up,'' says Mandel. ``Computers remain
their entire life. They don't pay any attention to The Real World.''
   ``You can burn out at 30 by losing your inspiration,'' says Jef.
``But you can also have substitute skills to allow you to do better
work. A lot of kid hackers don't realize that. They feel they've
lost it.''
   Mozart had been dead four years when he was Tenney's age. Tenney,
nonetheless, doesn't think he has composed his last concerto for
computer.
   ``An employer will say `Wow! How did you do this?' I tell him I
did it hacking 15 years ago. It was in my mental library.''

<TEXT>
   Craig Leres, Poskanzer's sidekick who spent hours trying to
unearth Morris' worm from Berkeley computers and is angry about it,
muses:
   ``What happens to old hackers? You start your own company and
make millions, and then you can spend all your time hacking.''
   ``You just call it research instead of hacking,'' says Jef.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Poskanzer's moon is about two hours farther along now. He and
Leres are discussing Morris' worm. They say they could have done it
much faster. Theirs would have elegantly closed the ``trapdoors'' by
which it entered, wouldn't have had ``hooks'' that could have caused
even more damage than it did, wouldn't have had a mistake on it as
the actual worm did.
   Did they know that when Morris was in elementary school in New
Jersey, he was so precocious the school let him use its computer to
assign students to lunchroom tables? That he let it be known that
for a dollar he'd work it out so you sat with your buddies and not
your enemies and definitely not with your unfavorite teacher?
   ``Maybe he was rebelling against the authoritarianism of
assigning kids to tables,'' says Jef, the middle-of-the-road hacker.
   ``He's a cracker,'' says Leres. ``I hope he does time. It would
be a precedent for others who might try the same thing.''
   Poskanzer turns off his moon. ``I got 39 requests for it when I
offered it on bulletin boards. I've copyrighted it, but I give it
away. I don't care. But I copyrighted it so no one else could put
his name on it. That I do care about.''
   Then, Hacker Ethic modified by Poskanzer's Amendment, he drives
home. A real, uncopyrighted new moon, just like his on the machine,
shines in the night sky across the Bay.
   Neat.

   Car and light truck sales among the nation's Big
Three automakers fell 12.3 percent in mid-January from last year,
when sales and consumer confidence bounced back following the stock
market crash, the companies reported Tuesday.
   Cars and light trucks sold by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp. dealerships sold at an average daily rate of
27,072 during the Jan. 11-20 period this year, compared with a rate
of 30,867 during the same period last year.
   There were nine selling days in both periods.
   Car sales among the Big Three dropped 17.4 percent, going to a
daily rate of 16,164 during the period this year from a rate of
19,565 in mid-January last year. Trucks made by GM, Ford and
Chrysler sold at 10,908 this year, compared with an 11,302 daily
rate last year, a decline of 3.5 percent.
   During the period last year, consumer confidence was on the
upswing after the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash. This year, the
Big Three, with Ford in the lead, began a round of cut-rate
financing with interest rates as low as 4.9 percent on some loans on
a limited number of cars and light trucks.
   The financing or cash-back programs, which cut the total cost of
a car by about the same amount, expire in March.
   So far this year, the Big Three have sold cars at a daily rate of
15,380, down 12.9 percent from the 17,659 daily rate for the first
20 days of January last year. Light truck sales have risen 5.2
percent to a daily rate of 10,520, compared with a rate of 9,999
during the same time last year.
   There were 16 sales days in the Jan. 1-20 periods both years.
   GM suffered the biggest year-to-year hit during the 10-day
period, as its car sales tumbled 21.9 percent to a 7,861 daily rate
this year from the daily rate of 10,066 during mid-January of last
year. GM's light trucks sold at a 4,306 daily rate, compared with a
rate of 4,488 rate during the same time last year, down 4 percent.
   Ford reported its cars sold at a daily rate of 5,842 during the
period this year, compared with a rate of 6,766 last year, a
decrease of 13.6 percent. Trucks made by Ford sold at a rate of
3,968 during mid-January this year, down 5.5 percent from a rate of
4,202 last year.
   Cars sales by Chrysler dropped 10 percent during mid-January this
year, going to a daily rate of 2,462 this year from a rate of 2,736
last year. Light trucks sold at a daily rate of 2,634 this year, up
0.8 percent from the 2,613 rate during the period last year.

<HEAD>Shearson Posts Lower Earnings; Morgan Stanley Reports Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. said Tuesday
it narrowed its fourth-quarter loss over a year earlier, while
Morgan Stanley Group Inc. reported a sharp jump in earnings.
   Both brokerage firms made a profit for all of 1988, although
Shearson said annual earnings fell slightly due partly to continued
expenses from the acquisition of E.F. Hutton Inc. in January 1988.
   Shearson said that for the three months ended Dec. 31 it lost
$13.5 million, compared with a loss of $95 million in the 1987
period. Revenue, though, shot up 63 percent to $2.9 billion from
$1.8 billion, reflecting the Hutton merger.
   Earnings in 1988 were restated to correct an overstatement in
income from Shearson's wholly-owned subsidiary, Boston Co.
   For the year, earnings totaled $96 million, or 81 cents a share,
down 5 percent from $101 million, or $1 a share, in 1987.Annual
revenue totaled $10.5 billion, up 56 percent from $6.7 billionin the
previous year.
   Morgan Stanley said its fourth-quarter net income rose to $108.3
million, or $4.25 a share, from $31.4 million, or $1.16 a share, in
1987. Revenue also rose, to $594.9 million from $339.5 million.
   For the year, earnings totaled $394.6 million, or $15.39 a share,
on revenue of $2.2 billion. That compared with net income of $230.9
million, or $8.99 a share, in 1987 and $1.8 billion in revenue.
   The October 1987 stock market crash had affected the results of
both Shearson and Mortan Stanley, as it had with other brokerage
firms that year.
   But Shearson noted that it also took a $77 million pre-tax charge
in 1987 related to the underwriting of part of British Petroleum Co.
PLC's disappointing $2.5 billion public stock offering, which had
taken place in the wake of the market collapse.
   Shearson blamed the decline in 1988 earnings on lower investor
participation in the financial markets, $165 million in expenses
associated with the Hutton merger and a $100 million pre-tax
write-down of MCorp securities held by the firm.
   Chairman Peter A. Cohen said, ``While we forsee a continuation of
a difficult enviornment in the financial markets, we are optimistic
for the year ahead. We will continue to be diligent in cutting costs
and reducing staffing levels ...''
   Morgan Stanley Chairman S. Parker Gilbert and President Richard
B. Fisher attributed their company's improved results to favorable
performances in equity and fixed-income divisions despite ``often
sluggish markets in the United States and Europe.''
   ``Important contributions were also made by our asset management,
foreign exchange and commodities businesses,'' they said in a joint
statement.

<HEAD>Dealers: Digging In On The Front-Line of the Car Wars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automobile dealers are on the front lines of the
car wars, and there's restlessness in the ranks.
   Many dealers say manufacturers are not doing enough to help them
shoulder the burdens posed in selling cars to increasingly
sophisticated consumers and in the face of growing competition.
   If the incoming president of the National Automobile Dealers
Association has his way, the dealers will be heard.
   ``The dealers have been a whipping boy for the manufacturers long
enough,'' Ron Tonkin said recent in a telephone interview from his
office in Portland, Ore.
   ``We feel very testy about the fact that in 1987, when automakers
were making big profits, dealers' profits were down 12 percent,''
Tonkin said. ``There has got to be some equity in this equation.
   Tonkin said one way of helping dealers might be to someday
require automakers to pay for space on dealership floors, much like
food and beverage makers pay for shelf space at the supermarket.
   Tonkin takes office Jan. 31 at the end of the NADA convention in
New Orleans.
   Scott LeFever, general manager of Northtowne Lincoln-Mercury in
Kansas City, Mo., also thinks manufacturers need to do more to aid
dealers, such as improving sales training.
   ``I don't think the training they're offering is targeted to the
real-life situation,'' LeFever said. ``It's what they would like to
believe what happens in the sale. They think the sale can go down by
being (only) honest and truthful.
   ``The people can adore you but they buy from you only because of
the price,'' he said.
   Dealers contacted in a spot check around the nation indicated
they believe customers are more knowledgeable than they were five
years ago about what they plan to buy and more sophisticated about
ways of financing the purchase.
   ``We've found some of them that come in that know more about a
product than some of our salespeople,'' said Doug Moreland, owner of
Cherry Creek Dodge in Aurora, Colo. ``They seem more sure in their
mind of what they're looking for. They want a lot more.''
   Additionally, the flurry of information available about car
features, options and available financing deals puts a bigger burden
on a salesperson to cut through the mass of information, said
Tonkin, a ``megadealer'' who owns 10 dealerships selling 14 makes of
cars and light trucks.
   ``If the (sales) person doesn't sell the customer the first time,
the chances of selling a subsequent time is very, very poor,'' he
said. ``There is so much product out there.''
   Competition poses another challenge, as the growing number of
foreign car dealers become increasingly willing to strike deals and
bargain with customers, a practice rarely seen in years past.
   Import sellers have been more willing to play the car-selling
game by traditional American rules as design and engineering of
domestic and imported cars become closer and as the number of
imported car dealers grows.
   ``Some of our import competitors are finding out that they've got
to get down and work to make a deal,'' Moreland said. ``They're not
used to doing what we have to do.''
   Bob Smith, owner of Bob Smith Audi-Volkswagen-Porsche of
Hollywood, Calif., has been in the car business for 52 years.
Recently, there have been bad times for Audi business, and he points
to what he calls disappointing dealership-manufacturer relationships
as a cause.
   ``They've got a lot of financially poor dealers...'' Smith said.
``They should buy them, but they are just going to sit there and let
us go down the drain.''
   Audi sales slumped sharply last year, falling to a daily sales
rate of 22,943 cars from 41,322 in 1987.
   Company spokesman Joe Bennett said Audi dealers already have
access to dealer, salesperson and sales manager incentives, which
can be passed along to customers to help boost sales. He said there
are no plans for the company to buy any of the 390 Audi dealerships,
down from 402 a year ago.

<HEAD>Pacific Telesis Group Reports Jump In Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pacific Telesis Group on Tuesday said its fourth-quarter earnings
rose 66 percent, completing a year that was the best since the phone
company was formed in the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.
   The San Francisco-based regional Bell holding company said
quarterly earnings were $249 million, or 59 cents per share,
compared with $150 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier.
Revenue for the final quarter was $768 million, down from $771
million the previous year.
   Excluding special items from both 1988 and 1987, fourth-quarter
earnings were essentially flat, Pacific Telesis said.
   For all of 1988, Pacific Telesis said its earnings rose 25
percent to $1.19 billion, or $2.81 a share, from $950 million, or
$2.21 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $3.04 billion from
$3.06 billion.
   The company cited cellular operations as a major source of growth
in the future.
   ``This has been a banner year for us, the best since
divestiture,'' Sam Ginn, Pacific Telesis chairman and chief exective
officer, said in a statement.
   Both annual and fourth-quarter results for 1987 included one-time
charges for an early retirement program and the restructuring of
PacTel Communications Cos., the company said.
   The 1987 year-end results also included the retroactive impact of
a California Public Utilities Commission decision on Pacific Bell's
1986 rates, the company said.
   Ginn also said the corporation took a charge of about $16 million
to fourth-quarter net income for restructuring and costs associated
with disposing of discontinued operations.
   Pacific Telesis's cellular and paging operations reported net
income of $16.6 million on revenues of $381.1 million during 1988.
In 1987, those operations posted earnings of $5.7 million on
revenues of $270.1 million.
   ``Cellular has experienced explosive growth since we began
acquiring properties in 1985 and 1986,'' Ginn said. ``This is a
critical source of growth for us in the future.''

   Stocks staged a strong advance on Wall Street
today as investors saw a brighter outlook for interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials surged 35.18 points
higher to 2,253.57 as of 2 p.m. EST.
   Advancing issues held a better than 2-to-1 margin over decliners,
with 938 stocks rising, 449 declining and 525 unchanged on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 133.88 million shares at
midafternoon.
   The market resumed an upward course following Monday's 17-point
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average as the dollar and bond
prices also rose.
   Jack Barbanel, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co., said the markets
were reassured by comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan that indicated he was satisfied with Fed policy on
interest rates.
   The markets believed that meant there would not be further
tightening of credit, Barbanel said.
   There also was a feeling in the markets that President Bush was
taking ``the right steps to develop a dialogue with congressional
leaders in terms of the budget deficit,'' Barbanel said.
   The analyst warned, however, that it remained to be seen if Wall
Street's sharp gains could hold up over the next few days. He called
the market ``slightly overbought.''
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was AT&amp;T, up ~ to 30].
   GAF rose 1{ to 50}. The company scheduled a Feb. 22 annual

<HEAD>New CEO Antoci Burnishes New Image of Thrift in Federal Rescue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A few days after Mario Antoci took the helm at
American Savings, he was asked to approve advertisements for a new
6-month certificate of deposit paying an attractive interest rate.
   The new chief executive balked at the thought of what the offer
would cost the savings and loan, which had just been rescued from
insolvency by the federal government.
   But in the end he let the ads go _ after first cutting the rate a
bit to a still-competitive 8.25 percent and inserting the words
``limited offer'' in the ad copy.
   Antoci uses the story to describe the tightrope walk he must
execute as head of what used to be the single biggest insolvent
savings and loan in the nation.
   He must bring interest rates down from inflated levels that the
struggling thrift used to attract desperately needed deposits, but
not so low as to chase away the loyal customers who have stuck with
American through years of travail.
   At the same time, he must convey the idea the new American
Savings, bought by corporate takeover strategist Robert M. Bass and
backed by $1.7 billion in federal promissory notes, really is a new,
solid and conservative institution.
   ``American Savings is a new company _ with a 104-year-old
tradition _ but a new company with a new direction,'' Antoci, 54,
said in a get-acquainted session with reporters earlier this month.
   American, based in Stockton, Calif., was formerly the nation's
second-biggest S&amp;L. It was seized by the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board last year and turned over to the Bass Group of Fort Worth at
year's end in exchange for a $350 million cash infusion.
   The government assumed responsibility for the bad assets _ a huge
portfolio of foreclosed real estate loans and mortgage-backed
securities earning below-market interest rates _ and promised
financial backing.
   The good assets, which at $15 billion are less that half of what
American used to be worth on paper, are the property of the
recapitalized American Savings, a subsidiary of a new,
Bass-controlled private holding company called New American Holdings
Inc.
   American's performance under its new management will be watched
as a key test of the government's controversial handling of the
nation's S&amp;L crisis.
   The sales of some badly managed bankrupt institutions to
financial sharpies such as Bass for what some lawmakers considered
fire-sale prices have incited widespread criticism in Congress.
   Antoci, hired away from the No. 2 job at Los Angeles-based H. F.
Ahmanson &amp; Co, the parent of Home Savings of America, the nation's
biggest thrift, is chairman and chief executive officer of both the
Bass-owned holding company and the S&amp;L.
   He told reporters that the Bass organization's move to hire him
reflected its commitment to the thrift's long-term health.
   Asked about speculation that Bass would sell American in a couple
of years, Antoci quoted him as saying, ``This is a keeper.''
   Rival thrift executives say Antoci was a good choice for Bass if
he's interested in re-establishing American as a conservative,
traditionally run thrift. Though he isn't widely known on a personal
basis, Antoci's reputation is as a solid numbers man who embraces
Home Savings' conservative strategy of emphasizing single-family
home lending.
   Antoci frequently invokes the Home Savings name and philosophy,
and the vision of the new American Savings he painted for reporters
is a near mirror image of Home: He'll concentrate on investing in
single-family mortgages, the meat and potatoes of the traditional
thrift.
   Ninety percent of those mortgages, he said, will be six-month
adjustable-rate loans, which protect the thrift from interest rate
swings.
   Antoci's appointment ``sends a signal that the institution is
going to be run in a conservative and traditional fashion,'' says
Bob Adelizzi, president of San Diego-based Home Federal Savings &amp;
Loan.
   He's described as a hard worker but an informal boss _ most of
his former co-workers call him Mario.
   A scuba diver and avid boater, he keeps his 58-foot motor yacht
moored off the back yard of his house on Huntington Harbor, an
Orange County suburb south of Los Angeles.
   Though outgoing in social settings, he says he doesn't intend to
become a high-profile public spokesman in American advertising.
   Rather, Antoci says he's content to let a 1950s-themed ad
campaign dress up his message, that American will offer competitive
rates and attentive service.

<HEAD>U.S. Requests Swiss Help In French Insider Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States formally asked
Switzerland Tuesday to freeze accounts at four banks cited by U.S.
officials in an insider trading probe that has caused a political
scandal in France.
   The accounts are believed linked to alleged stock market
manipulation in the takeover of U.S.-based Triangle Industries Inc.
by the French state-owned industrial company Pechiney SA.
   The accounts were provisionally blocked Dec. 19. At that time,
Swiss authorities acted on a request for judicial assistance from
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The formal demand lists detailed allegations, including
U.S.-compiled evidence of criminal acts, a Swiss justice ministry
spokeswoman said.
   Under a U.S.-Swiss treaty, judicial assistance can be granted
only if the alleged offenses fall under the criminal code in both
countries.
   The banks cited by the U.S. investigators are Union Bank of
Switzerland, Banque Cantonale Vaudoise, Schweizerische Volksbank and
Banca Della Svizzera Italiana. Accounts in the banks allegedly were
used to steer part of the takeover transactions on the New York
stock market.
   Top aides of French President Francois Mitterrand have been
implicated in the affair. Alain Boublil, chief of staff of the
French Finance Ministry, resigned last week, though he denied buying
shares on inside information.
   The SEC alerted French authorities after noting abnormally heavy
purchases of Triangle shares in the week before Pechiney publicly
launched its successful takeover bid Nov. 21.
   Pechiney bought Triangle, the former parent of American National
Can Corp., for $56 a share, nearly six times the value a week
earlier.
   French authorities have not yet asked Switzerland for judicial
assistance.
   Under the decentralized Swiss judicial system, implementation of
the formal U.S. request and subsequent possible moves like the
lifting of bank secrecey and handover of records are up to
authorities in each canton, or state.

   The stock market surged higher today as investors
grew optimistic about the outlook for interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 29.29 points to
2,247.68 as of 3 p.m. EST.
   Advancing issues held a nearly 2-to-1 margin over decliners, with
933 stocks rising, 495 falling and 512 unchanged on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 138.08 million shares with one
hour of trading left.
   Wall Street returned to its upward course following Monday's
17-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average as the dollar and
bond prices also rose.
   Jack Barbanel, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co., said the markets
were reassured by comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan that indicated he was satisfied with Fed policy on
interest rates.
   The markets believed that meant there would not be further
tightening of credit, Barbanel said.
   There also was a feeling among traders that President Bush was
taking ``the right steps to develop a dialogue with congressional
leaders in terms of the budget deficit,'' Barbanel said.
   The analyst warned, however, that it remained to be seen if Wall
Street's sharp gains could hold up over the next few days. He called
the market ``slightly overbought.''
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was Security Pacific
Corp, up { to 36~.
   Occidental Petroleum, also heavily-traded, was unchanged at 27]
after it said its 1988 earnings would rise significantly.
   GAF rose 1] to 50|. The company scheduled a Feb. 22 annual
meeting at which shareholders will vote on the proposed $53-a-share
cash and securities buyout led by Samuel J. Heyman, the firm's
chairman and chief executive.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
1.44 to 161.57. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index rose 0.34 to 318.37.

<HEAD>Quarterly Net Cut By Reserve For Commercial Titan Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin Marietta Corp. Tuesday said its
income fell about 60 percent in the fourth quarter reflecting
establishment of a reserve to compensate for increasing competition
in commercial satellite launching.
   But, for all of last year the company reported a 55.6 percent
increase in profit, record sales and an all-time high of backlogged
orders.
   ``The year's results attest to the vitality and strong earning
power of our core busineses and give us renewed confidence of solid
future earnings progress,'' said Norman R. Augustine, chairman and
chief executive.
   The company said after-tax earnings came to $23.7 million, or 45
cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, down from $59.4
million, or $1.12 a share, in the corresponding 1987 quarter. Fourth
quarter sales totaled $1.5 billion, compared to $1.3 billion for
1987's fourth quarter.
   In 1988, Martin Marietta's profit totaled $358.9 million, or
$6.75 per share, compared with $230.7 million, or $4.25, per share
in 1987. The record sales amount was $5.7 billion, up from 1987's
$5.1 billion and the backlog of undelivered orders amounted to $11.2
billion vs. $10.8 billion in 1987.
   Earnings for 1988 included a fourth quarter reserve of $90
million, or $1.05 per share, to put the Commercial Titan launch
program ``on a more conservative footing,'' the company said. The
reserve was more than offset for the year's results by a $2.25 per
share from the third quarter sale of Hoskyns Group plc, a British
data systems subsidiary.
   The reserve for the Titan program reflects prospective revenues,
costs, and demand for commercial launch vehicles. Titan equipment is
used in the launch of commercial and military communications
satellites.
   ``It was considered a prudent action in view of current industry
pricing following the recent entry into the world market of the
Chinese Long March launch vehicle,'' the company statement said.

<HEAD>Minkow Holding Bible Study in Jail While Waiting Fraud Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barry Minkow, the youthful con artist
convicted of committing fraud through his ZZZZ Best rug shampooing
outfit, has been running a Bible study class for other federal
prisoners while awaiting sentencing, a prosecutor said.
   Jailers at the Metropolitan Detention Center refer to the group
of up to 10 inmates who meet nightly as ``Barry's boys,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney Gordon Greenberg said after a court hearing Monday.
   ``He has the inmates listening to a sermon and Bible study,'' he
said.
   Minkow, 22, was convicted on 57 counts of fraud last month.
   He started his business in his parents' garage at age 15 and
became known through his TV advertisements. Though he was called a
business whiz kid and his company was traded on Wall Street,
investigators found it was an elaborate scheme and charged him with
multimillion-dollar securities fraud.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices rallied Tuesday in late trading on the
London Stock Exchange to close at the day's best level and to set
yet another post-crash record high.
   At the close of trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 16.4 points, or 0.9 percent, at 1,941.1.
   Trading was still brisk, but much reduced from its recent active
pace, as many institutional investors stepped back from the market
ahead of Friday's scheduled release of British trade figures for
December.
   Volume slackened to 562.8 million shares from 649.9 million on
Monday and more than 900 million last Friday.
   ``People are wary the market has gone up so quickly. They have
backed off a little bit, but there's still no sign people are
wanting to pull out. It's just a question of whether they'll put
more money in,'' one equity salesman said.
   After a rise of nearly 150 points, or 8.3 percent, in the
100-share index since the start of the year, market-makers initially
marked prices lower Tuesday in expectation of a decline. This was
quickly reversed, however, as fresh buying ensued from several large
institutional programs.
   Shares took off again in late afternoon, rallying in sympathy
with an early surge on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 11.2 points at 1,580.7
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 8.96 points
to close at 1,092.99.

<TEXT>
   Futures prices of soybeans and corn climbed higher
while wheat futures sank at the close of trading Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans advanced more than 11 cents for the March spot contract.
   ``A rumor that the Russians bought 600,000 tons of meal from
Brazil or the United States supported the beans, and corn went along
for the ride,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Weighing on wheat prices were a forecast of rain in the Great
Plains growing area and talk that Secretary of Agriculture-designate
Clayton Yeutter ``isn't too keen on export bonuses,'' Lespinasse
said.
   Corn's rally was shortened by reports of a new USDA catalog of
corn due out next week that would provide an avenue for more spot
sales, analsysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 6 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.38} a bushel; corn was 2} cents
to 3} cents higher with March at $2.73 a bushel; oats were unchanged
to 1 cent lower with March at $2.36 a bushel; and soybeans were 4{

   Prices rose sharply on Wall Street today, as
investor optimism about interest rates carried the stock market past
the level where it stood before the October 1987 crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 38.04 to 2,256.43.
It was the first time the widely-followed index had closed above
2,246.74, where it finished on Oct. 16, 1987, the last trading day
before the market collapse.
   Wall Street was carried higher today by optimism about interest
rates and by its own recent strength.
   Jack Barbanel, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co., said the markets

   Alfred E. Goldman, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in
St. Louis, said today's price surge fed on itself, as investors on
the sideline jumped into the market for fear they would miss the
latest rally.

<HEAD>Union Pacific Reports 34 Percent Quarterly Earnings Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Pacific Corp. Tuesday reported a 34
percent fourth-quarter profit gain and a 32 percent gain in income
from continuing operations in the final quarter of 1988, a year in
which the parent of Union Pacific Railroad completed a major portion
of its restructuring.
   In the three months ended Dec. 31, the corporation had after-tax
earnings of $187.4 million, or $1.65 a share, up from $139.8
million, or $1.23 a share, during Oct.-Dec. 1987.
   Earnings from continuing operations totaled $156 million, which
came to $1.38 a share. The comparable 1987 figures were $118.4
million and $1.03.
   Revenue in the quarter came to $1.58 billion, up from $1.38
billion in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   For all of last year, Union Pacific reported net income of $643.9
million, or $5.65 a share, and revenue of $6.07 billion, up from
$582.9 million, or $5.10 a share, and $5.35 billion in 1987.
   Last year's earnings from continuing operations were $558.7
million, or $4.90 per share, vs. $494.8 million, or $4.32 a share in
1987.
   Drew Lewis, chief executive officer of the corporate parent of
Omaha, Neb.-based Union Pacific Railroad, said ``Strong performances
were achieved in every phase of our business.
   ``We are pleased with the financial results and the strategic
steps we took in 1988 to enhance shareholder value,'' Lewis said.
``If the economy does not weaken and there is not a major energy
price deterioration, we believe 1989 will be another year of strong
earnings.''
   Among the steps taken in 1988 was the withdrawal of Union Pacific
Resources from the refining business.
   A good showing by Union Pacific Railroad contributed to the
corporation's overall earnings growth. Increased traffic,
improvements in productivity and higher prices helped the railroad's
profitability.
   Mike Walsh, chairman of the Omaha-based railroad, said he
expected earnings to continue to improve in 1989.
   ``We've succeeded in getting the railroad growing again after
four years of flat revenues,'' Walsh said in a news release, noting
that 1988 was the third consecutive year in which the railroad
improved profits by at least 15 percent.

<HEAD>Digital Announces New Computers; Admits Miscalculation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. announced new midsize
computers Tuesday, and President Kenneth Olsen admitted the company
had miscalculated how popular the middle of its Vax line would be
compared with its own top-of-the-line models.
   Olsen said its midsize Vax 6200 computers had ``cannibalized''
sales of its 8800 models, which have more powerful processors but
cost more.
   ``It hurt our pride in planning _ embarrassed us,'' Olsen said of
the unexpectedly slow sales of its 8800 models. On the other hand,
he said, the company was pleased with the strong sales of the 6200s.
   Introduced Tuesday was a 6300 series, which Digital said offers
up to 35 percent better performance than the 6200 computers at only
5 percent higher price. The company also announced new data-storage
devices.
   Steve Noyes, engineering manager for Digital's Vax line, said the
8800 series of computers, with its more powerful processors, is
still best for customers who have big jobs that can't be decomposed
into several jobs and distributed among several weaker processors.
   Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., said its new machines, the Vax
6310 up through the Vax 6360, offer from 3.8 times to 22 times the
performance of the Vax 11-780, Digital's first Vax system.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Rebound From Selloff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices rebounded from the selloff at
the start of the week as traders Tuesday turned their attention to
an upcoming meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC nations.
   Still, the price of crude oil, which broke the $19-a-barrel level
this month, remained well below $18 a barrel during the trading
session, and some analysts said it appeared doubtful that prices
would return to those higher levels any time soon.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate _ the benchmark grade of U.S. crude _ rose 21
cents to finish at $17.54 a barrel.
   The contract had fallen $1.06 on Monday in what some analysts
called an expected ``correction'' following a recent strong rally
fueled by confidence in OPEC's production-cutting pact.
   Among refined petroleum contracts traded on the exchange,
February home heating oil settled 0.64 cent higher at 50.87 cents a
gallon, after losing 2.10 cents on Monday.
   The February contract for unleaded gasoline, which declined 2.08
cents in Monday's session, settled at 50.45 cents a gallon, up 1.03
cents.
   ``Right now the market is a little confused as to whether
yesterday's decline was the beginning of a sharp movement downward
or just a correction,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior analyst with
E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   ``I think it was overdone, and I think (Tuesday) we just had a
rebound off yesterday,'' he said.
   Chris McCormack, an energy analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., agreed, but wasn't too bullish about the direction of prices
in the near future.
   ``I think the market pretty much has discounted all the bullish
news,'' McCormack said. ``I don't think crude is sustainable at
$19.''
   Analysts note that since early October, West Texas Intermediate
had risen more than $7 on optimism that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries would significantly cut its output to
help shore up sagging worldwide prices.
   A daily quota of 18.5 million barrels went into effect Jan. 1,
and traders said there were indications that OPEC was sticking to
that level.
   Analysts said traders were now turning their attention to
Thursday's scheduled meeting in London between OPEC and non-OPEC
nations.
   ``I think the market feels that something positive could come out
of that meeting,'' said McCormack.

   The dollar rose Tuesday after Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress he was committed to
fighting inflation. Gold prices fell.
   Currency traders speculated that the Fed might battle inflation
by raising short-term interest rates, a step that would make
dollar-denominated securities such as Treasury bills more attractive
to investors and drive the dollar upward.
   In his testimony to the House Banking Committee, Greenspan said
the risks of inflation were great enough that the Fed ``might well
be advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness than of
stimulus.''
   Before Greenspan spoke the dollar had been down from its levels
of late Monday. One factor in the drop was a report that Japan was
cutting its budget deficit, which would strengthen the Japanese yen,
said Michael Malpede, senior currency analyst at Refco Group Ltd. in
Chicago.
   The Federal Reserve did not sell dollars to halt the currency's
rise, as it has in recent trading sessions, although it did call
dealers asking for quotes late in U.S. trading, Malpede said. Asking
for quotes is a way to remind traders that the Fed is watching and
prepared to intervene.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.25 yen to a closing 126.95 yen.
Later, in London, it edged back up to 127.17 yen. In New York the
dollar rose to 127.70 yen from 127.55 yen late Monday.
   In London, the British pound was cheaper for buyers at $1.7700
compared to $1.7733 Monday. Later in New York the pound fell to
$1.7690 from $1.7760 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8415 West German marks, up from 1.8319; 1.5607
Swiss francs, up from 1.5490; 1.1822 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1883; 6.2618 French francs, up from 6.2328; and 1,347.5 Italian
lire, up from 1,343.5.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
levels, included: 1.8395 West German marks, up from 1.8385; 1.5523
Swiss francs, down from 1.5577; 6.2335 French francs, down from
6.2545; 2.0680 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0780; 1,340.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,353.00; and, 1.1866 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1888.
   Gold fell in light trading in London to a late bid of $407 a troy
ounce, down from $407.75 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal fell to $407.10 bid from
$407.40 bid late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 16 cents to close at a bid
$408.99.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $406 a troy ounce from $407.80 Monday. Later,
Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid at
$404.80 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $407 an ounce late
Monday.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $6.21 a troy
ounce, up from $6.20 bid late Monday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $6.130 a troy ounce from $6.194

<HEAD>Marathon Oil Says New Policy Will Help Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marathon Oil Co. is looking forward to doing
business in Libya again but is still waiting for the green light
from Washington, a company spokesman said Tuesday.
   ``We have not received official notification,'' said Donald
Herring, Marathon's director of public affairs-energy. ``So, we are
not able to really add any information to anything until we have
some discussions with the government.''
   Ronald Reagan, in one of his last acts as president last week,
authorized American oil companies to resume doing business in Libya
in a bid to head off the potential nationalization of their huge
investment in that country.
   The move also was designed to end what was called the significant
windfall profits Libya has reaped since the Reagan administration
imposed the ban on the U.S. operations there in 1986.
   In the absence of the American companies, Libyans have been
working the U.S. oil fields and keeping the income.
   ``Obviously, it did not help that for 2{ years we have been
unable to be in Libya, where we have a one-sixth interest in the
Oasis Oil Co. Those were profits lost,'' Herring said.
   He said he did not have any figures on how much money Marathon, a
subsidiary of Pittsburgh-based USX Corp., lost during the sanctions.
Marathon is based in Findlay, Ohio, about 45 miles south of Toledo
in northwest Ohio.
   ``We have said that we would welcome a return to our Libyan
operation if government approval was forthcoming,'' he said. ``It
appears that it is.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman has said the
announcement will permit the oil companies to resume their
operations in Libya, transfer operations to foreign subsidiaries or
sell their assets if they so desire.
   Other affected companies are Occidential Petroleum, Conoco
Petroleum, W. R. Grace and Amerada Hess. Their investments in Libya
are believed to total in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Before the embargo went into effect, Libya received 51 percent of
the revenues derived from the U.S. oil operations.
   When the administration imposed broad trade sanctions against
Libya in 1986, it authorized the companies to negotiate
``standstill'' agreements with Libya.
   The agreements, which expire June 30, provided for the suspension
of company operations to protect the companies from charges of
default on their contractual obligations to work their concessions
in Libya.
   The companies have been concerned that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi might seize their assets if the agreement expires and the
sanctions are not lifted.

   Optimism about interest rates sent stock prices
sharply higher Tuesday and propelled the Dow Jones industrial
average past the point where it stood before the October 1987 Wall
Street crash.
   The Dow Jones average, which reflects the performance of 30
blue-chip industrial stocks, rose 38.04 to close at 2,256.43.
   Tuesday's session was the first time since the crash that the
widely-followed index closed above 2,246.74, its finish on Oct. 16,
1987, the last trading day before the market collapsed and the
average plunged 508 points.
   Prices have surged higher on Wall Street over the last 10 weeks,
with momentum building as more and more investors jumped into the
market for fear of missing out on the rally.
   That was the case again Tuesday, said Alfred E. Goldman, a market
analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   ``You experienced a mini buying panic,'' Goldman said. ``You
could almost sense institutions with large sideline cash saying, `oh
my gosh, I'm going to miss the boat.'''
   The catalyst for the latest session's gains was congressional
testimony by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   Jack Barbanel, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co., said the financial
markets were reassured by statements by Greenspan that indicated he
was satisfied with Fed policy on interest rates. The markets
believed that meant there would not be further tightening of credit,
Barbanel said.
   The dollar and Treasury bonds moved higher in response to
Greenspan's testimony, with the stock market following suit.
   Goldman said Greenspan's remarks could be interpreted as either
positive or negative, ``But since the bond market rallied, it points
out at this moment, market participants have a bullish mind set.''
   The Treasury's closely-watched 30-year bond was up more than
$8.50 per $1,000 in face amount by late afternoon.
   Analysts expected the Wall Street rally to continue.
   ``The market is getting frothy, but it still has upward
potential,'' Goldman said.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by better than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,009 issues up, 477 down and 498 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 189.62 million
shares, up from 141.64 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 222.89 million shares.
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was Security Pacific,
up | to 37.
   Merck rose 1\ to 61~ after posting a positive fourth-quarter
earnings report.
   GAF rose 1\ to 50{. The company scheduled a Feb. 22 annual

   Among other gainers, IBM rose 1~ to 124\ and General Motors rose
1[ to 89{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $29.931 billion, or 1.07
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.86 to 161.99.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.43 to 333.26, and S&amp;P's

<HEAD>New Houston-Built Oil Rig Said To Be Largest And Deepest For Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL L. GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GALENA PARK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a rarity these days for the
economically depressed oilfield equipment industry, a Houston-area
manufacturer Tuesday dedicated a new oil rig that officials said
would be the largest and deepest land rig to drill in Europe.
   The 197-foot-tall rig was assembled by Houston-based National
Oilwell for INA-Naftaplin of Yugoslavia and will be used to drill in
the Dinarides area of that country near the coast of the Adriatic
Sea.
   The $10.5 million so-called ``super-deep'' rig is capable of
drilling three wells simultaneously to depths of up to 25,000 feet
and is touted as having a unique brake system that controls the
speed of the pipe going into the holes in the earth.
   ``All of our new business is for overseas,'' said Donald W.
Vogelsang, general manager of drilling equipment for National
Oilwell. ``There was an abundance of rigs ordered during the boom
days and there are a lot available rigs (for domestic use).''
   Bozidar Omrcen, vice president for INA-Naftaplin, saw the rig for
the first time Tuesday at a Texas barbecue that marked the
completion of the 10-month project.
   ``We are very satisfied,'' he said. ``This is a big day. A lot of
people are here to celebrate.''
   His company pumped 22 million barrels of oil in 1986 and is the
leading marketer of oil and gas in Yugoslavia. Tuesday's delivery is
the largest of three rigs made for INA-Naftaplin.
   The celebration in a warehouse adjacent to the rig was a dim
reminder of the heady days of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when
oil prices approached $40 per barrel, construction of oil rigs was
non-stop and rig dedication parties were the norm.
   Pat Smith, spokeswoman for National Oilwell, recalled times when
at least seven rigs were being assembled at one time in the
industrial area east of Houston.
   For some companies now, seven rigs would be a good year, industry
officials acknowledge.
   For example, this week's latest Baker Hughes Inc. count of rigs
looking for oil in the United States was 789. The lowest the count
reached last year was 880. In December 1981, the tally peaked at
4,500.
   The rig sent off Tuesday is the first to be completed in months
by National Oilwell, company chairman Bob Smith said.
   ``To have a brand new rig of this size range is very unusual
because the industry was so overbuilt and there is such an overhang
in inventory and there hasn't been that much demand for new
equipment,'' Smith said. ``So this is very unusual, although our
company has 11 drilling rigs on order _ all overseas.
   ``By and large, the international companies are focusing their
investments outside the United States. For a company that is
strictly a United States company, that is a problem.''
   Smith said he sees a turnaround in the domestic market but
nothing significant for several years and even then, no return to
the boom conditions.
   ``Until it does, the fact we have a strong international
presence, we will be able to maintain a strength in the company,''
he said.
   In addition to the rig, INA-Naftaplin also is purchasing more
than 60,000 feet of pipe.
   The rig probably would begin drilling a 6,000-meter project _
about 19,000 feet _ by late May or early June, according to Omrcen.
   Vogelsang said now that officials were certain the rig would work
and all bugs were removed, it would be taken apart piece by piece
and shipped to Yugoslavia for re-assembly.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Fall Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices fell drastically Tuesday on the Coffee,
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
   The March contract dropped 634 points, or 6.34 cents, during the
trading session.
   ``It was a blood bath,'' said Bert Ruiz, a broker in New York
with Balfour Maclaine Corp. ``The decline was due to the
anticipation of a greater availability of coffee from Brazil. The
market will be flooded with Brazilian coffee, due to the goverment's
economic austerity plan introduced last week.''
   Because of new warehouse fees, Brazilian coffee exporters have
had to unload their coffee onto the world market, said Ruiz.
   Futures prices have been rising since early December, but have
leveled off since a March contract high of $1.66.90 on Jan. 3.
   Coffee settled 5.70 cents to 6.34 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in March at $1.3451.
   Futures prices of soybeans and corn climbed higher while wheat
prices sank at the close on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans advanced more than 11 cents for the March spot contract.
   ``A rumor that the Russians bought 600,000 tons of soy pellets
from Brazil or the United States supported the beans, and corn went
along for the ride,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Weighing on wheat prices were a forecast of rain in the Great
Plains growing area and talk that Secretary of Agriculture-designate
Clayton Yeutter ``isn't too keen on export bonuses,'' Lespinasse
said.
   At the close, wheat was 4\ cents to 7 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.37} a bushel; corn was 2 cents
to 3\ cents higher with March at $2.72\ a bushel; oats were } cent
to 2 cents lower with March at $2.35\ a bushel; and soybeans were 5\
cents to 12 cents higher with March at $7.67{ a bushel.
   Futures prices of livestock and meat finished mixed to mostly
lower after drifting higher most of the day on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   The market dipped in anticipation of an Agriculture Department
cold storage report showing record inventories of frozen pork
bellies, said Chuck Levitt, livestock analyst for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   But while the report _ released after the closing bell _ had
113.3 million pork bellies on hand Dec. 31, the largest number ever
for that date, it was still 7 million less than expected, said
Levitt.
   Live cattle prices, supported by packer demand, were mixed, he
said.
   Live cattle settled .27 cent lower to .30 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in February at 72.82 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .17 cent lower to .30 cent higher with January at 83.55
cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
February at 43.12 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .55
cent lower to .20 cent higher with February at 39.15 cents a pound.
   Gold and silver prices tumbled on the Commodity Exchange in New
York.
   Comments in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday by President Bush and
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan were interpreted as
anti-inflationary, undercutting the prices for precious metals, said
Jim Steel of Refco Inc. in New York.
   Gold settled $1.80 to $2.90 lower with the contract for delivery
in January at $406.30 a troy ounce and silver was 6.4 cents to 7.1
cents lower with January at $6.13 a troy ounce.
   Platinum futures prices fell sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Trading was weighed down by concerns about possible government
instability in South Africa following Prime Minister P.W. Botha's
recent illness, said Steel.
   Platinum settled $9.30 to $12.30 lower with the contract for
delivery in January at $531.20 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Traders think something positive could come out of Thursday's
meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC nations, said analysts.
   Crude oil settled 21 to 35 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in March at $17.54 a barrel and heating oil was .24 cent to
.57 cent higher with February at 50.87 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
   A government appeals board Tuesday refused to
disturb a contract that has been called the computer deal of the
century, denying a challenge by Honeywell Federal Systems Inc. to
last fall's award to the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   The contract at issue is expected to total more than $1 billion.
   The Board of Contract Appeals of the General Services
Administration ``has issued an opinion today denying the protest of
Honeywell,'' said Judge Vincent LaBella, who chaired the three-judge
panel that considered the matter.
   ``The board proposes to release its opinion to the public
Wednesday after providing the parties an opportunity to request any
appropriate (removal) of (proprietary) material that should be
protected from disclosure. But the protest has been denied.''
   Honeywell Federal Systems was one of six competitors that fought
long and hard for the Air Force contract, which was finally awarded
last October to AT&amp;T Technologies Inc., a subsidiary of AT&amp;T.
   The Air Force is acting as the executive agent for the other
armed services, which together are trying to standardize and update
their computer systems. The contract calls for AT&amp;T Technologies to
deliver about 20,000 mini-computers over the next five years.
   ``We're very pleased by this decision,'' Herb Linnen, an AT&amp;T
spokesman in Washington, said Tuesday.
   ``From the start, we believed the Air Force conducted a thorough
and proper evaluation, which clearly supported its decision to award
the contract to AT&amp;T.''
   The Air Force contract to AT&amp;T so far totals $929.1 million, but
company and service officials agree its value could easily exceed $1
billion depending upon what options are exercised.
   The Air Force is buying the computers for its own use as well as
that of the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Defense Communications Agency
and Defense Logistics Agency. From the moment bids were requested,
the contract had been recognized as being so large it could ensure
the winner a strong position in the highly competitive industry for
years to come.
   Judge LaBella did not offer any explanation of the GSA board's
ruling, noting the opinion would not be released until Wednesday.
One of the main issues, however, involved the Air Force's internal
ranking procedures for bids.
   In its appeal, Honeywell charged it provided the Air Force a
``best and final offer'' that substantially undercut that of AT&amp;T _
$744 million, or $185 million below that of the winner _ while still
passing technical muster.
   The company alleged the Air Force recalculated its bid upward
using internal criteria without informing the company, but even with
that change its bid still was more than $140 million below that of
AT&amp;T.
   Ron Cuneo, vice president and general manager of Honeywell
Federal Systems, said Tuesday he had been informed of the decision
but ``I have not seen the opinion, obviously.''
   ``I'm disappointed, of course, that we lost,'' he continued.
``Somehow, you would think in this budget environment that $140
million would mean something, but apparently not. Generally, I think
the system works. But I'm not sure it did here.''
   Cuneo said it was premature to discuss the possibility of
appealing the board's decision to the courts.

   The FBI on Tuesday subpoenaed clearing firms that
serve the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade,
stepping up its probe of alleged fraud at the nation's largest
futures exchanges, authorities said.
   Meanwhile, a federal grand jury assembled Tuesday to begin
hearing testimony from traders subpoenaed last week in the wake of a
two-year undercover federal probe, according to attorneys who
represent some traders.
   U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas and FBI officials declined to
comment on the latest developments.
   Federal law enforcement officials are investigating as many as
100 brokers and traders amid allegations that customers were
systematically cheated out of millions of dollars. Agents posing as
traders wore hidden tape recorders to document alleged wrongdoing in
the crowded, frantic trading pits.
   Clearing firms are among the exchange's largest members. They
have authority to handle retail orders and contract out the physical
trading of those orders in the pit to independents traders, also
known as locals.
   Julie Jacobs, a Mercantile Exchange, spokesperson, said exchange
officials had no idea how many of the exchange's 81 clearing firms
were subpoenaed.
   ``Chicago Mercantile Exchange officials were informed today
(Tuesday) that many of the CME clearing member firms have been
served with subpoenas to provide various records relating to trading
activity on the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange,'' the Mercantile Exchange said in a statement.
   ``The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's attorneys have advised that
such subpoenas are a normal part of a grand jury investigation and
do not imply that the firms receiving such subpoenas or their
officers are targets of the investigation, or are suspected of any
wrongful actions,'' the statement read.
   Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma declined further comment on the probe.
   The Merc's Jacobs described the clearing firms as ``middle men''
between the trader and the Merc's own clearing house department,
which clears _ or matches _ buy and sell orders made during trading
each day at the exchange.
   Clearing firms are required to own seats on the exchanges where
they do business.
   The Board of Trade and Merc are marketplaces in which buyers and
sellers essentially bet millions of dollars on the futures prices of
financial instruments and commodities, such as Treasury bills or
soybeans.
   Board of Trade spokesman Mark Prout declined comment on the
latest subpoenas. The Board of Trade has 136 clearing firms.
   Prout said the only subpoena he knew about was served last
Thursday to the Board of Trade by the FBI, which ordered the
exchange to turn over records dating as far back as January 1983.
Agents are to review the material at the exchange rather than remove
the huge volume of documents subpoenaed, Prout said.
   Later Tuesday, two Board of Trade officials told traders and
other members the exchange ``will never tolerate violations of our
rules and regulations and have always aggressively prosecuted those
who have broken our rules.''
   ``If any members have taken part in trading practices which are
illegal or violate our rules and regulations they are not
representative of the 3,500 members of the CBOT,'' exchange chairman
Karsten Mahlmann and president Thomas R. Donovan said in a letter.
   Separately, John Troelstrup, an attorney who said he represents
at least one of those subpoenaed last week, said he understood that
some of those targeted by the FBI were to begin appearing before the
grand jury in Chicago on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   He declined to name his clients or to say whether they were among
those ordered to appear this week.
   ``I know that subpoenas were issued for tomorrow (Wednesday) and
for a week from tomorrow,'' said Harvey Silets, an attorney who said
he represents subpoenaed traders from both exchanges.
   Silets also declined to name his clients or to say when they were
ordered to appear before the grand jury.

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major developments in the investigation
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its plea agreement on securities
fraud charges:
   May 12, 1986 _ The Securities and Exchange Commission charges
Dennis Levine of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with making $12.6
million in profits from illegal trading on inside information since
1980.
   June 5 _ Levine pleads guilty to four felonies, agrees to
cooperate with the government's investigation and surrenders $11.6
million in illicit profits and restitution.
   Nov. 14 _ Stock speculator Ivan Boesky agrees to pay a $100
million penalty to settle charges of trading on insider information
supplied by Levine in 1985 and 1986. He also agrees to cooperate
with investigators in a much broader investigation of Drexel and its
chief financier, Michael Milken.
   Jan. 28 _ Michael Davidoff, former head trader for Boesky, pleads
guilty to one count of securities fraud and agrees to cooperate.
   Feb. 20 _ Levine is sentenced to two years in prison and fined
$362,000 on charges of securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.
   March 19 _ Boyd L. Jefferies, founder of the Los Angeles
securities firm Jefferies &amp; Co., pleads guilty to two violations of
securities laws in exchange for cooperating in the government's
investigation. He quits the brokerage and agrees to stay out of the
securities business or at least five years.
   April 23 _ Boesky pleads guilty to a single charge of conspiracy
to lie to the SEC, punishable by five years imprisonment and a
$250,000 fine.
   Dec. 18 _ Boesky is sentenced to a three-year prison term and no
fine.
   March 24, 1988 _ Boesky begins serving his sentence at a
minimum-security facility in Lompoc, Calif.
   July 5, 1988 _ Dennis Levine is released from Lewisburg, Pa.,
federal prison facility to serve the remainder of his term at a
halfway house in Manhattan.
   Aug. 4 _ A grand jury indicts five partners in the investment
concern Princeton-Newport Partners and a former Drexel trader over
an alleged multimillion dollar fraud and racketeering scheme, the
first-ever racketeering charge against securities professionals.
Defendants deny wrongdoing and their attorneys call the indictment a
pressure tactic to force their cooperation in a much larger
investigation of Drexel and Milken.
   Sept. 7 _ The SEC accuses Drexel, Milken and three other
employees of violating a wide range of securities laws, most in
connection with Boesky. Drexel and the others deny the accusations.
   Oct. 20 _ A federal appeals court halts the Drexel case because
of a dispute over the impartiality of the presiding judge, Milton
Pollack.
   Nov. 30 _ Intense secret negotiations are reported between Drexel
and federal prosecutors in a last-ditch attempt by the firm to avert
an indictment, particularly racketeering charges, which carry
enormous penalties.
   Dec. 1 _ Drexel's chief executive Frederick Joseph tells
employees Drexel might settle the case by pleading guilty to some
charges.
   Dec. 7 _ Princeton Newport Partners liquidates because of what
defense lawyers call brutal government misuse of the racketeering
laws to coerce their clients into cooperating in the Drexel
investigation.
   Dec. 21 _ Drexel agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a
record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle what became
the biggest securities fraud probe in history. Under the settlement,
Drexel must also settle the related SEC litigation and cooperate in
the government's pursuit of other alleged wrongdoers.
   Jan. 25, 1989 _ The government files formal charges against
Drexel, publicly detailing for the first time the accusations to
which it will plead guilty. Most are related to the firm's alleged
relationship with Boesky.

<HEAD>Okla., N.C. Farmers Blast FmHA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers from Oklahoma and North Carolina
blasted the Farmers Home Administration on Tuesday for the
procedures being used by the government agency in contacting
delinquent FmHA borrowers.
   ``FmHA has developed this delinquency notice packet which cost
you and me about $344,000 to mail out to scare farmers during the
holiday season,'' Don Schierer, a farmer from Ponca City, Okla.,
told the Senate Agriculture subcommittee on agricultural credit.
   ``The information contained in the packet is what the progressive
farm groups fought for, but the FmHA's implementation was the most
narrow and rigid route possible,'' said Benny Bunting, of Oak City,
N.C., chairman of the credit committee of the National Family Farm
Coalition.
   Over 80,000 delinquent notices were sent under provision of the
Agriculture Credit Act of 1987, giving borrowers 45 days to request
consideration in writing for loan program options.
   ``The 45-day period fell right at the time of the Thanksgiving,
Christmas and New Year holiday season,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., Agriculture Committee chairman. ``Thus, FmHA's timing was out
of step with the intent of the act, which required final notices be
published by June 6. Also, their timing could not have been worse in
terms of borrowers being able to comply.''
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., subcommittee chairman, also said the
FmHA has not followed the Senate's intent.
   He chided Neil Johnson, acting FmHA administrator, for the number
of forms the agency required farmers to fill out in response to the
delinquency notice.
   ``The law says you (farmers) have to sign a letter'' within a
45-day period, not fill out several forms, said Boren.
   He urged Johnson to ``put a safety net'' under the farmers who
made an attempt to respond and give them more time.
   He said he would ask Agriculture Secretary-designate Clayton K.
Yeutter to make solving the problems connected with implementing the
law a top priority.

   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc. said Tuesday it has
extended the deadline for expiration of its $24.53 billion tender
offer for RJR Nabisco Inc. until midnight Feb. 6.
   Kohlberg Kravis said in a statement the deadline was extended
because of the Federal Trade Commission's examination of the offer.
The FTC investigates proposed mergers to determine whether they
violate federal antitrust laws.
   Kohlberg Kravis said more than 35.89 million RJR Nabisco shares
had been tendered to it and not withdrawn. RJR Nabisco has nearly
225.34 million shares outstanding.
   Meanwhile, RJR Nabisco said Tuesday it had received a
satisfactory ``solvency letter'' from American Appraisal Capital
Services Inc.
   American Appraisal was asked to determine if the value of RJR
Nabisco's assets would exceed its liabilities after the acquisition
by Kohlberg Kravis. The evaluation was required under terms of the
Kohlberg Kravis offer.

<HEAD>Owner of Destroyed Oil Rig Offers $187 Million to Victims' Families</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives of the 167 victims of July's oil rig
explosion in the North Sea have been offered a total of $187 million
in compensation payments, the rig's owner, Occidental Petroleum
Corp., disclosed Tuesday.
   Armand Hammer, chairman and chief executive officer of the Los
Angeles-based oil company, revealed the offers in a meeting with
financial analysts in New York. A summary of Hammer's remarks to the
New York Society of Security Analysts was released by the company's
headquarters.
   Occidental's oil platform Piper Alpha off Aberdeen, Scotland,
exploded and burned July 6. The platform was destroyed and 167 men
were killed.
   Hammer said he believed most of the victims' families would
accept the compensation Occidental has offered them.
   Most of the company's cost will be covered by insurance, he said.
   Oil and gas production from Occidental's Claymore and Scarpa
platforms, which fed through Piper Alpha, will resume by the end of
the first quarter, Hammer said. The company previously had said
production at the fields would resume by the end of 1988.
   Occidental officials previously have estimated lost production
from the disaster would cut year-end profit by between five and 10
cents a share, or $13.2 million to $26.5 million.

   MAI Basic Four Inc. asked a federal judge Tuesday
to lift a court order blocking a $20-a-share bid for Prime Computer
Inc. and tried to answer questions about the financing of the deal.
   In court documents responding to a judge's concerns, MAI Basic
said Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is confident ofraising $875 million
to finance the takeover despite its guilty plea in a massive
securities fraud settlement in New York.
   U.S. District Court Judge A. David Mazzone last month said MAI
Basic needed to make disclosures about the relationship between
Drexel and New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, who controls MAI
Basic.
   Mazzone also said MAI Basic concealed information concerning past
securities law violations or alleged violations by LeBow and William
Weksel, another principal in the takeover bid.
   MAI Basic, based in Tustin, Calif., said that Drexel since 1986
has been the primary financier for LeBow and certain of his
companies, and owns 7 percent of MAI Basic's common stock.
   If the takeover goes through, the disclosures say, Drexel Burnham
will earn $33 million in financing or advisory fees, may perform
future work worth $22 million in fees and will be allowed to buy
more MAI Basic stock at a discount.
   MAI Basic also said Weksel agreed to turn over $208,000 in
profits made from a separate stock sale as part of a consent decree
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1986. LeBow has been
sued in connection with that case but no action has been taken
against him by the SEC, the disclosures said.
   Drexel last month agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay
a record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle the
securities fraud case in U.S. history.
   Natick-based Prime said the financial disclosures do not provide
enough information on the deal and that the company will fight to
keep the court order in place.
   Prime said in a statement that the documents do not adequately
explain how MAI Basic plans to meet federal requirments concerning
using the takeover target's own stock as collateral for loans needed
to finance the deal.
   As of Jan. 19, 70.9 percent of Prime's undiluted outstanding
common stock had been tendered, MAI Basic spokeswoman Toni Lee said.
The company has extended its tender offer until Jan. 30.
   But Prime spokesman Richard Eckel said because of the firm's
convertible debentures _ bonds that the bearers can convert to
common stock _ the tenders represent only about 53 percent of the
total diluted stock.
   One of the conditions of MAI Basic's original tender offer was
that the company control 67 percent of the fully diluted stock,
Eckel said.
   In a related offensive, MAI Basic released a letter to Prime
blasting the company for an ``unnecessary, exorbitantly expensive
and clearly unsuccessful program'' to convince shareholders not to
accept MAI Basic's offer.
   The letter from LeBow points out that a majority of shareholders
have accepted the tender offer and calls on Prime officials to
negotiate.

<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. on Tuesday rejected as
inadequate a $3.2 billion hostile buyout offer from Shamrock
Holdings Inc., setting the stage for a threatened proxy fight for
control of Polaroid.
   Shamrock, a television and radio concern owned by the Roy E.
Disney family, last week increased its offer to $45 per share for
all Polaroid stock, including 9.7 million shares issued under
Polaroid's controversial employee stock ownership plan.
   The previous offer of $2.6 billion, or $42 per share, did not
include the employee shares.
   In a statement, Polaroid called the latest sweetened offer
``inadequate from a financial point of view and not in the best
interest of Polaroid and its stockholders, except Shamrock and its
affiliate.''
   ``Polaroid's board strongly recommends that stockholders reject
the Shamrock offer and not tender any of their shares of common
stock,'' Polaroid stated.
   On Tuesday, Polaroid stock rose 12{ cents a share to $40 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Tom Reed, a spokesman for Shamrock, said the Burbank,
Calif.-based company would proceed with its plan to nominate a slate
of candidates for election to Polaroid's board at the company's
annual meeting May 9.
   Shamrock's candidates would be committed, if elected, to selling
the company either under Shamrock's offer or to any third party that
made a higher bid.
   Shamrock President Stanley P. Gold said he was disappointed by
Polaroid's rejection of Shamrock's $45 per share offer.
   In a prepared statement issued from Burbank, Gold said: ``We
intend to vigorously pursue our tender offer and our previously
announced plans to wage a proxy contest for control of Polaroid if
our tender offier is not consummated prior to Polaroid's May annual
meeting.''
   Polaroid spokeswoman Marcia Phillips declined comment on
Shamrock's proposed proxy challenge.
   Shamrock said when it extended its offer Jan. 19 that about 13.1
million Polaroid shares, or 18.3 percent of the outstanding stock,
had been tendered and not withdrawn.
   Shamrock's tender offer expires March 15, and is contingent on
obtaining at least 90 percent of Polaroid's 71.6 million outstanding
shares.
   Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Bache Inc., said
Polaroid's management could be forced into a leveraged buyout to
thwart Shamrock's takeover attempt.
   ``My guess is that the next time Shamrock is forced to extend its
offer, that the number of tendered shares will probably move up to
close to 25 million,'' he said.
   Henderson said 25 million tendered shares _ amounting to nearly
35 percent of the outstanding shares _ combined with the 6.9 million
he said Shamrock already holds could frighten Polaroid executives
into financing a leveraged buyout to avoid having to sell the
company to Shamrock.
   Polaroid has been resisting Shamrock since last July, when
Shamrock offered $40 per share in a friendly but unsolicited bid.
   Shamrock is appealing a Delaware Chancery Court ruling upholding
the employee stock ownership plan. The Delaware Supreme Court has
scheduled a hearing on the appeal March 16.
   Shamrock contends the employee stock was issued to block a
takeover. If it is invalidated, Shamrock has promised to raise its
offer to $3.36 billion, or $47 per share.
   The stock plan owns about 14 percent of Polaroid's stock. It
makes a takeover extremely difficult because under Delaware law a
hostile suitor must gain at least 85 percent of its target for a
takeover to be allowed. Polaroid is incorporated in Delaware.

<TEXT>
   ConAgra Inc. filed suit Tuesday in U.S.
District Court in Omaha, claiming Tyson Foods Inc. violated federal
securities laws by issuing ``false and misleading'' statements
during its bid to acquire Holly Farms Corp.
   ConAgra spokesman Walt Casey said the suit asks the court to stop
Tyson from issuing any ``further misrepresentations'' about Tyson's
offer to acquire Holly Farms or a separate agreement between Holly
Farms and ConAgra.
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry-processing operation, last
week increased its offer for Holly Farms to $63.50 a share, valuing
the company at $1.3 billion.
   Also on Tuesday, Tyson filed an amended suit in a Delaware court
seeking to block the friendly merger worth about $1 billion between
Memphis, Tenn.-based Holly Farms and ConAgra, based in Omaha.
   Last year, in an effort to avert the takeover, the Holly Farms
board of directors worked out the friendly merger with ConAgra.
Tyson went to court in Delaware and obtained a ruling that the
merger didn't adequately protect the rights of Holly Farms
shareholders. The Holly Farms board responded to that ruling by
setting up an auction last week.
   Last Thursday, Tyson officials said they thought the deal had
been completed. But, hours later, Holly Farms' board raised some
concerns about legal entanglements arising from the ConAgra
agreement and about Tyson's ability to make good on its offer.
   ``Tyson made a false public claim,'' Casey said, when the company
said Holly Farms had accepted a $63-a-share bid from Tyson last
Thursday, followed by the Holly Farms board's questions about the
offer.
   Casey said Tyson also issued a news release last Friday
indicating that the Holly Farms board would recommend Tyson's
$63.50-a-share proposal to shareholders, but later Holly Farms said
its board was unable to accept Tyson's proposal.
   That ``intentional market manipulation ... was part of Tyson's
effort to induce Holly Farms shareholders to prematurely sell their
stock,'' Casey said in a statement.
   Casey said ConAgra has two contracts with Holly Farms, a
termination fee and a lockup option allowing the food-processing
company to buy about half of Holly Farms' key facilities regardless
of whether the company succeeds in buying Holly Farms.
   Any offer that does not recognize those conditions is ``illusory
at best,'' Casey said in an interview.
   ConAgra does not ask for specific damages in the suit, Casey said.
   ``The most immediate thing is asking the court to enjoin Tyson to
cease and desist any further misrepresentations,'' Casey said.
   James Blair, general counsel for Tyson, said Tuesday that Tyson
has asked a Delaware judge to invalidate the merger agreement with
ConAgra and issue a declaration that would permit Holly Farms to
accept the Tyson proposal.
   ``I think it's just legal posturing, legal ploys,'' Blair said,
referring to ConAgra's suit. ``I know our people haven't done
anything wrong. However, it's hard to comment about it until I see
the suit.''
   Tyson is seeking $500 million in damages from Holly Farms' board,
Holly Farms and ConAgra if the deal falls through.
   Tyson says that lockup option must be removed before it agrees to
the acquisition.

<HEAD>Ashland Talking With Iran About Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. says its chief executive,
John Hall, has talked with Iranian officials about a possible
out-of-court settlement of the multimillion-dollar lawsuits between
them.
   Hall has met from time to time with Iranian officials for months,
according to Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum. But he said the
negotiations were mostly about Ashland's countersuit.
   Schrum also denied an oil industry trade publication report,
which quoted an Iranian oil official as saying Ashland already had
agreed to pay $283 million to the National Iranian Oil Co.
   Ashland has not agreed to pay principle or interest involving the
Iranian state oil company's claim, Schrum told the Lexington
Herald-Leader on Monday.
   The case is scheduled to go to trial May 15 in U.S. District
Court in Jackson, Miss. A similar but separate lawsuit is winding
its way through Bermuda courts.
   National Iranian Oil has contended that Ashland failed to pay for
$283 million worth of oil the Iranians sent the company in 1979,
after revolutionaries seized power in Iran and took U.S. Embassy
workers hostage in Tehran.
   Jimmy Carter, who was president at the time, imposed a trade
embargo against Iran, apparently during the time between the order
of the oil and its delivery.
   The Iranian oil company has asked for $283 million plus interest,
bringing the amount of its lawsuit to more than $500 million.
   Ashland has countersued the Iranian company for breach of
contract, contending that the Iranians failed to deliver all the oil
Ashland had ordered.
   Ashland's countersuit could amount to more than $500 million.
   Iranian deputy oil minister Kazempur Ardebili, however, said
Ashland had offered to pay the Iranian company the original price of
the oil shipments, according to Platt's Oilgram News.
   Steve Truitt, an attorney for National Iranian Oil in Washington,
D.C., said he was prohibited by law from commenting on the case to
the news media.
   An oil industry analyst said he expected Ashland to negotiate a
settlement with the Iranians.
   ``I've always been convinced that they (Ashland) were going to
settle _ the only question was how,'' said Jack Shaughnessy of
Advest Inc.
   Ashland previously set aside the money to settle with the Iranian
company, Shaughnessy said, and ending the case would clear the decks
of the uncertainty of a trial.
   But Shaughnessy said he would be surprised if Ashland paid the
Iranians as much as $283 million.
   A U.S. District Court judge has ruled that Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Agazadeh must come to the United States to give a
deposition before the trial.
   National Iranian Oil has appealed the ruling requiring Agazadeh's
appearance, said Alex Alston Jr., a Mississippi attorney for the
company.

<HEAD>Newspaper Ad Spending Expected to Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspaper advertising spending is expected
to rise 6 percent overall this year, according to a forecast
released Tuesday by the Newspaper Advertising Bureau.
   The forecasted gain matched the bureau's preliminary projected
figures for 1988.
   ``We're expecting an overall 6 percent gain for newspaper
advertising spending, with national advertising up 4 percent, retail
up 6 percent and classified up 8 percent,'' said Leo Bogart, the
bureau's executive vice president.
   The preliminary projected figures for 1988 showed national up 3
percent, retail up 5 percent and classified up 9 percent for an
overall gain of 6 percent to about $31.1 billion.
   The forecast was released at the annual sales meeting of the
International Newspaper Advertising and Marketing Executives.
   ``This decade has seen steady growth in the economy and in
newspaper advertising as well,'' Borgart said. ``At the start of the
80s, advertisers spent $14.8 billion. This year, at the end of the
80s, they will spend an estimated $33 billion.''
   He said the New York advertising agency of McCann-Erickson Inc.
estimated that in the year 2000 total advertising in the United
States will reach $348 billion.
   ``Newspapers' share of that would be $84 billion if our share
declines at the very slow rate it has in the 80s,'' Bogart said.
``If we can stop that decline and recapture the share we had in
1980, we will be a $96 billion medium.''
   He told the executives the ``$12 billion difference'' was their
stake in recapturing ``a growth momentum.''
   The Newspaper Advertising Bureau Inc., founded in 1913, serves as
the promotional arm of the newspaper advertising business in the
United States and Canada.

<HEAD>Venezuelan President-elect Plans Economic Reform Package</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuelan President-elect Carlos
Andres Perez said he plans a series of economic reforms, including
elimination of the two-tiered foreign exchange system.
   Perez, addressing a group of business leaders late Monday, said
the two-tiered exchange system, in operation to allow subsidized
imports of strategic goods, would be eliminated once he takes office
Feb. 2.
   The official exchange rate is 14.50 bolivars to the dollar, while
the free market rate fluctutates between 30 and 40 bolivars to the
dollar.
   Perez did not say whether the bolivar would be allowed to float
according to the market, or whether one single official rate would
be established.
   In the last two days, the bolivar has gained on the dollar on
rumors that the incoming government would establish a single rate of
about 25 bolivars to the dollar, below the current market rate.
   Along with reform of the exchange system, Perez promised to do
away with price controls, reduce government spending and free
interest rates.
   Advisers to Perez earlier this week said the economic reforms
could even include turning over state-run companies to the private
sector, although Perez did not mention this possibility in his
speech to the business leaders.
   Venezuela is currently in the initial phases of talks with the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in order to receive
fresh funds to back up dollar reserves depleted by a stagnating
economy.
   Critics of the reform package say Perez is giving in to pressures
from the international banking system that will lead to hardships
for the general population, including soaring inflation with the end
of subsidized imports and price controls.
   Perez said his government would not decree an across the board
wage increase, but would mandate a rise in the minimum wage and
implement a ``food basket'' at reduced prices for the poorest
Venezuelans.

   Several of the nation's largest petroleum companies said Tuesday
their fourth-quarter profit fell as the erosion of crude prices hurt
oil and gas production, dragging down gains in refining and
marketing.
   Exxon Corp., the nation's largest oil concern, said its profit
plunged 11 percent, while Chevron's earnings were down 25 percent,
Mobil's declined slightly and Sun Co.'s profit fell 8 percent.
Separately, Amerada Hess Corp. said its earnings rebounded after a
loss in the 1987 quarter.
   For the three-month period ended Dec. 31, Exxon's net income fell
to $1.4 billion, or $1.06 a share, from $1.6 billion, or $1.12 a
share in the comparable 1987 period.
   No. 2-ranked Mobil said earnings declined 1 percent in the latest
quarter to $469 million, or $1.14 a share, from $474 million, or
$1.15 a share in the year-earlier period.
   Chevron's net income totaled $175 million, or 51 cents a share,
from $234 million, or 68 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter,
while Amerada Hess reported net income of $66 million, or 80 cents a
share.
   Analysts said that after several quarters of rising earnings, oil
companies failed to withstand the steady drop in petroleum prices
that occured throughout most of 1988.
   ``With the decline in crude prices last year versus a year ago,
(the companies) just weren't able to offset it from stronger
refining and marketing,'' said Thomas C. Lewis, an analyst with Duff
&amp; Phelps Corp., a Chicago investment concern.
   However, industry experts said Tuesday that steadily rising oil
prices in 1989 could improve exploration and production performance
in the first quarter, but won't necessarily lower margins in
refining because of recent improvements in that segment of the
business.
   New York-based Exxon said fourth-quarter revenue remained nearly
unchanged at $22 billion vs. a year earlier.
   Exxon said earnings for all of 1988 rose 9 percent to $5.3
billion, or $3.95 a share, from $4.8 billion, or $3.43 a share, in
1987. Sales for 1988 rose 5 percent to $87.5 billion from $83.3
billion in 1987.
   The company said earnings from refining, marketing and chemicals
operations continued strong in the fourth quarter due to ``lower
crude oil acquisition costs and relatively firm product prices.''
   But weak crude prices resulted in sharply lower earnings from
exploration and production despite an increase in output, Exxon
Chairman L.G. Rawl said. In the fourth quarter alone, Exxon's U.S.
production earnings plunged 57 percent to $144 million from $335
million in the 1987 period, and for all of 1988, they fell 37
percent to $829 million from $1.2 billion, the company said.
   Mobil, also based in New York, said fourth-quarter revenue
declined 2 percent to $13.9 billion from $14.2 billion in the
year-earlier period.
   For all of 1988, Mobil earnings rose 55 percent to $2.1 billion,
or $5.09 a share, from $1.3 billion, or $3.28 a share, in 1987.
Revenue rose 7 percent to $54.9 billion, from $51.4 billion in 1987.
   Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray attributed the company's yearly
gain to improved profit margins in refining and marketing due to
strong worldwide demand and improved margins in Europe, Japan and
other areas. A record performance by Mobil's chemicals unit _ helped
by tight supply and strong demand _ also contributed.
   But Mobil's exploration and production results also were
adversely affected by a 19 percent drop in crude oil prices during
the year and higher exploration expenses, Murray said. For the
fourth quarter, exploration and production results declined $210
million and for the year they fell $389 million, he said.
   San Francisco-based Chevron said its revenue declined 7 percent
to $6.9 billion from $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   For the year, Chevron's earnings rose 41 percent to $1.8 billion,
or $5.17 a share, from $1.3 billion, or $3.65 a share in 1987. Its
revenue declined slightly to $28.9 billion from $29.1 billion the
year before.
   Chevron Chairman Ken Derr said the company's 1988 earnings
rebounded with the help of a strong refining and marketing segment
and low crude prices. But those same weak oil prices contributed to
Chevron's fourth-quarter loss of $64 million in its oil and gas
production unit.
   Sun, based in Radnor, Pa., said its profit for the fourth quarter
fell to $76 million, or 72 cents a share, compared with $83 million,
or 77 cents a share, a year earlier. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 4.2
percent to $2.72 billion from $2.61 billion a year earlier.
   For the year, Sun's profit plunged to $7 million, or 6 cents a
share, from $348 million, or $3.21 a share, in 1987. The latest
results reflected an afte-tax charge of $297 million in the second
quarter for a writedown in assets intended for sale and related
costs.
   Revenue for the year edged up to $10 billion from $9.82 billion
in 1987.
   Amerada Hess said its net income totaled $66 million in the
fourth quarter, or 80 cents a share, compared with a net loss of
$79.6 million, or a minus 93 cents a share, for the same period in
1987. Revenue totaled $1.2 billion, compared with $1.8 billion for
the year-year period.
   The New York-based company said its fourth quarter results
include a charge of $30 million for capitalized exploration expenses
related to certain of its undeveloped properties. Its 1987 results
reflected non-recurring income of $73 million, resulting from
reductions or refunds of foreign taxes.
   Amerada said its refining and marketing earnings were $90.1
million compared with a loss of $195 million in the 1987 quarter,
reflecting writedowns of crude oil and refined product inventory
values.
   However, the company's exploration and production operations lost
$300,000 in the latest quarter, including similar crude oil
writedowns.
   For all of 1988, net income totaled $124 million, or $1.51 a
share, down more than 40 percent from 1987. Revenue amounted to $4.3
billion compared with $4.8 billion in 1987.
