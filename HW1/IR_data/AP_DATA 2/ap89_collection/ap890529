   About 50 members of a Roman Catholic parish held
a Mass outside their shuttered church while cars and trucks whizzed
by, but a spokesman for their archdiocese said their ceremony was
just a stunt.
   ``They locked us out,'' said Sandy Simun, a member of Mother of
Our Saviour Church in northwest Detroit for 14 years. ``We need our
church.''
   Mother of Our Saviour was one of 30 Detroit parishes with
dwindling congregations that were ordered closed by Cardinal Edmund
Szoka to save money. The move sparked hot criticism from some
Catholics, who argued that it was discriminatory to close
inner-city churches. The churches were told to close by June 30 and
some have already done so.
   Mother of Our Saviour had 57 member families.
   Some members of Mother of Our Saviour gathered Sunday to protest
the action with a service led by the Rev. Arthur Lovely from Sts.
Peter and Paul Church.
   ``There should not have been a Mass there,'' said Jay Berman, a
spokesman for the 1.5-million-member Archdiocese of Detroit. ``That
parish has a pastor and administrator who determined that there
would be no further sacramental activity.
   ``It's regrettable that another priest decided to come and say
Mass there.''
   Berman declined to say if any action would be taken against
Lovely. He called the service a stunt to gain media attention for
protesters of Szoka's decision earlier this year to close the
parishes.
   Among those attending the service was Sister Beth Rindler, who
was fired as a pastoral associate at the church last week for
refusing to turn over to the archdiocese $7,000 contributed by
church members. She said the money belongs to the parish and not
the archdiocese.
   ``We do not have a situation, as sister has made out, where the
money belongs to the people,'' Berman said. ``It goes into the
custody of the pastor and, to a much smaller part the bishop, to
use in the works of the church, the whole church.''
   Simun, 59, said he was willing to fight.
   ``They've raped us of our church and now they're trying to rob
us of our money,'' Simun said. ``I have a right to revolt, it hurts
so deep.
   ``We're going to have church out here till they jail us.''
   Since the closings plan was announced, Szoka's residence has
been picketed by protesters.
   Church officials said the closings were needed because the
city's Roman Catholic population has fallen from 100,000 to fewer
than 50,000.
   An additional 25 churches have been given until next year to
prove their viability.

   Iran says it has hanged 11 more drug
traffickers convicted of selling heroin and opium, bringing to 720
the number of executions under an anti-narcotics campaignt launched
in December.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the 11 were
hanged Monday in the cities of Ferdows, Tabas, Qaen, Rasht,
Isfahan, Shiraz and Arak.
   IRNA said the traffickers were convicted by a special Islamic
revolutionary court of selling and distributing large quantities of
drugs in cooperation with international narcotics smugglers.
   A new law that took effect in January imposes the death penalty
for possession of even small quantities of drugs.
   The law also gave addicts six months to kick the habit or face
prosecution. Iranian officials have said those who fail to meet the
July 23 deadline will be sent to labor camps for at least a year.
   At least 2 million of Iran's estimated 50 million people
reportedly are involved in drug abuse.

   Inner Mongolia is telling its hard-drinking
populace that getting drunk may soon be illegal.
   Legislators in the northern China autonomous region are now
considering regulations that would ban alcoholism, the China Daily
reported today.
   The official paper said local officials are alarmed by the
growing social problems caused by alcoholism in an area where fiery
grain alcohols are a part of all social events and have always
helped people get through the long, bitterly cold winters.
   It said every man age 18 years and older consumed an average of
59 pounds of spirits last year.
   Seventy-six murders, 16 percent of the total last year, were
linked to heavy drinking and 24 out of the 126 people sentenced to
death during the year committed their crimes after excessive
drinking, the paper said.
   Drunkenness was also blamed for rising traffic accidents and
divorce.
   The report did not say how the legislators planned to define
alcoholism or what penalties might be imposed for extra-legal
imbibing.

   Gator gawkers have been gathering at two Dallas
suburbs to see the creatures known more for their swamp escapades
than for carousing through Texas.
   Big reptiles spotted in Irving and Plano have created quite a
stir in recent weeks. The latest rage are T-shirts and special
drinks, such as the ``Gatorade'' served at an area bar.
   But Texas alligators, which trek the 250 miles up the Trinity
River from the Gulf of Mexico, are certainly not new to the area
and are more abundant in Dallas County than most think, said an
official of the Dallas Museum of Natural History.
   Richard Fullington, deputy director of the museum, said recent
discoveries of gators in Irving and Plano reminded him of an
incident in 1987 when residents of southeast Dallas believed that
some kind of green-skinned swamp creatures inhabited a gravel pit.
   ``We got calls from people out there. They were in a panic,''
Fullington recalled. ``One statement was that there was a
three-toed Martian out there eating dogs.''
   Well, how about alligators, instead?
   Lately, a 5-foot-long alligator has been lurking in the murky
depths of Lake Carolyne in the Las Colinas development at suburban
Irving.
   And on Wednesday, animal-control workers in Plano caught an
alligator-like reptile in a pond.

   The right to a job and decent housing should be
as basic as the right to free speech, officials within one of the
nation's largest mainline Protestant denominations have declared in
a proposed ``economic bill of rights'' to the U.S. Constitution.
   Picking up where the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
left off, three agencies within the 1.7 million-member United
Church of Christ are asking the church to work for a constitutional
amendment to guarantee every American a minimum income, meaningful
employment and affordable housing.
   The proposed pronouncements to be voted on by several hundred
clergy and lay delegates to the 17th General Synod in Fort Worth,
Texas, represent ``the unfinished work of the American
experiment,'' according to Audrey Chapman of the UCC's Office for
Church and Society.
   The synod runs from June 29 to July 4.
   Others within the nation's fifth-largest mainline Protestant
denomination characterize the economic proposals as unrealistic, an
example of a church bureaucracy out of touch with its predominantly
upper-middle-class constituency.
   Support for such proposals can be found ``primarily in the left
wing of the Democratic Party or the Socialist Party,'' said W.
Widick Schroeder, a professor of religion and society at the
Chicago Theological Seminary.
   This is not the first time the denomination has tackled
capitalism.
   In 1934, in the midst of the Depression, the General Council of
the Congregational Christian Churches, one of the forerunners of
the Church of Christ, condemned capitalism and voted 130-17 to
``work toward the abolition'' of the economic system. The General
Council disclaimed the resolution in 1952, five years before the
denomination merged with the Evangelical and Reformed Church to
form the UCC.
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops has been the most
recent dramatic entrant into the discussion over religion and the
economy, drawing fire from individuals such as former Treasury
Secretary William Simon with its proposal that every person should
have the right to a job.
   The United Church of Christ proposal would take the Catholic
idea a step further by calling for a constitutional amendment.
   In its proposed pronouncement on ``Christian Faith and Economic
Life,'' the Office for Church and Society of the UCC is proposing
that the church work for such an amendment to guarantee such
``rights'' as a national health program, a national minimum income
and ``a right to employment consistent with each person's
potential, including a role for the government as employer of last
resort.''
   The proposal was judged too conservative by some groups, too
radical by others.
   A separate pronouncement recommended by the Commission for
Racial Justice and the Council for Racial and Ethnic Ministries
seeks the same constitutional guarantees, but adds a call for ``a
transformation of the capitalist economic system.''
   In an effort to present a united front, representatives of the
three sponsoring groups recently developed a proposed compromise
pronouncement that adds some data showing how minorities bear an
unequal burden of poverty and unemployment, but drops the
anti-capitalist language of the original pronouncement submitted by
the groups representing minorities in the church. The
denomination's Pension Boards, which oversee $800 million in church
investments, share a different perspective.
   Schroeder, who worked on a report to synod delegates by the
Pension Boards, called the proposed economic bill of rights
``utopian'' and unworkable. He argued that greater government
intervention will promote inefficiency, leading to fewer resources
and greater strife over the distribution of wealth.
   But Rebecca Blank, one of the creators of the bill of rights
proposal, said the United States, unlike some developing nations,
has the means to provide for all its citizens.
   ``I think it's almost entirely an issue of political will in
this country,'' said Ms. Blank, a professor of economics and public
affairs at Princeton University.

   Boy of the Year, high school honors
graduate, athletic standout, Harvard scholar. Jose Luis Razo was a
barrio youth who made good.
   Now he's standing trial for a string of armed robberies that
coincided with his college breaks or vacations _ and blaming drugs,
delusion and a boyhood friend for the holdups and the case against
him.
   Jurors must decide if Razo is a guilt-wracked victim of his
success or, as the prosecutor charges, a ``cocky liar'' who has
been ``taking people for a ride for a long time.''
   Razo, 22, is on trial in Orange County on 10 counts of robbery
and one of escape. The case is expected to go to the jury by next
week.
   He's also set to go on trial soon in Los Angeles County, where
he is charged with three counts of robbery and six of assault with
a deadly weapon.
   Razo moved to California with his family in the late 1960s. As a
youngster, he was an altar boy. Police describe him as a former
gang member, but family and friends remember him as a Boys Club
``Boy of the Year.''
   ``He went from a struggling background to the epitome of success
for a young man,'' said Richard Guthrie, director of the La Habra
Boys Club.
   At Servite High School, a Roman Catholic school in Anaheim, Razo
was an ``A'' student and standout football player wooed by over 60
colleges around the country when he graduated.
   He chose a scholarship to Harvard University, where Hispanics
represent only 4.7 percent of the student body.
   As a freshman in 1985, he set out to study psychology and talked
of becoming a lawyer.
   ``He always said, `Look how good I'm doing. I'm Mexican. I'm
trying to make it in a white world,''' his sister Martha said in
July 1987. ``He's out to prove to people that he's as smart as
anyone.''
   In December 1985, a masked man started robbing fast-food
restaurants, grocery stores and dairies in Southern California. The
holdups netted the gunman more than $27,000 and coincided with
trips Razo made to California.
   When Razo called police in June 1987 to say he had information
on an unrelated crime, he was questioned about the robberies.
   When pressed, he confessed.
   It wasn't Razo's first run-in with police. At 17, he was
convicted of petty theft. A few months later, he was charged with
assault, although that case was dismissed.
   His videotaped confession became the cornerstone of the robbery
prosecution. Motions to get the confession thrown out failed.
   In a jailhouse interview after his arrest, Razo said: ``I wasn't
taking money from anybody that really, really needed it. I did the
crime, I'll do the time.''
   About his life at Harvard, he said: ``I didn't fit. I was
confused.''
   Later, free on $100,000 bail, Razo claimed he used the stolen
money to help his poor family and needy friends. They said they
never saw it. In fact, his sister said: ``My mom always sent him
money. She wouldn't pay bills to send him money.''
   In court, Razo pleaded innocent and said he had confessed in a
drug-induced stupor during which he accepted blame for the crimes
because he felt guilty about being successful while his family and
friends were not.
   He testified that the holdups were committed by a childhood
friend and drug dealer, Richard Longoria. He said Longoria had
described the robberies to him in detail.
   ``In hindsight, I now see that I was feeling very guilty about
my Harvard experience, my comfortable lifestyle,'' Razo testified
Wednesday. ``I was feeling alienated from my family at home and
Mexicans in general.
   ``I wanted to be accepted in a normal, everyday type of way in
terms of the neighborhood and friends I had known. I was wanting to
truly identify with Richard Longoria.''
   Deputy District Attorney Ravi Mehta and Razo's attorney, John
Barnett, have been trying to locate Longoria. But Barnett said he
wasn't sure if Longoria's testimony could help the defense. Mehta
said it wouldn't make any difference.

<HEAD>Louisiana's Parents Can't Cut Their Children Out of the Will</HEAD>

   Diana Simek loves her children, but she
doesn't want Louisiana's ``forced heirship'' laws to determine who
inherits her property. So she and her husband moved across the
border to Texas.
   ``Our children will inherit everything after we're both gone,''
Mrs. Simek said. ``But if I go first, I would want my husband to
have full control over what we built together.''
   Forced heirship is a one-of-a-kind Louisiana law that decrees
that children must inherit a portion of their parents' estate. In
the 49 other states, people who have the proper will drawn up can
leave their legacies to anyone or anything.
   Louisiana is the only state that bases its statutes on the
Napoleonic Code, which originated in France. Under its laws, an
only child is entitled to one-fourth of the deceased parent's
estate, no matter what either parent wants. Two or more children
divide half of the estate equally.
   Such laws were conceived in contrast to primogeniture, the
tradition of giving everything to the eldest son, and helped break
up large land holdings.
   State Sen. Sydney Nelson has tried for 10 years to repeal forced
heirship.
   ``It deprives Louisiana residents of the freedoms enjoyed by
citizens of all other states to dispose of their property as they
choose,'' Nelson said. ``Other states do have laws protecting
spouses, but ours is the only state that gives the children a right
to demand a certain percentage of their estate.''
   But Cynthia Samuel, a Tulane University law professor, said
Louisiana needs forced heirship more today than it did 30 years ago
because of divorce and remarriage.
   ``I think our present law tells a very admirable story about us.
It says we respect the moral bond between parent and children that
lasts a lifetime,'' Samuel said. ``It's the last act by which the
parent expresses regard for the people he brought into the world.''
   Mrs. Simek, 50, and her husband, Leonard, 54, lived in
Shreveport for nine years before seeking refuge in Harrison County,
Texas, a 30-minute drive from Shreveport, where they still work.
   Under Texas law, ``if I die, he gets everything,'' Mrs. Simek
said.
   Their three children, ages 29, 30 and 31, all live in Louisiana.
   ``Our taxes are much higher in Texas,'' Mrs. Simek said. ``If
they ever change the law, we'll move back.''
   Nelson said lots of people in the Shreveport-Bossier City area
in northwestern Louisiana have left because of the law, especially
out-of-staters who end up there because of Barksdale Air Force Base.
   ``Many people come to this area to retire after being at
Barksdale,'' Nelson said. ``But if you've once enjoyed the freedom
to leave everything to your wife and children, and you find out
your children can demand a fourth or half of your property, people
are incensed.''
   People who believe children don't deserve an inheritance did get
a little more room to maneuver four years ago, when the state
expanded the reasons for which a parent can disinherit a child.
Until that time, it was reported that only two children had been
disinherited in 170 years.
   Now there are 12 ``sins of the children,'' including failing to
pay ransom for kidnapped parents, refusing to bail them out of
jail, striking or attempting to murder a parent or failing to
contact the parent for two years.
   Nelson and others have managed to chip away at the law in other
ways, too.
   Spouses of the deceased are permitted to have use of community
property until he or she dies or remarries. However, a portion of
separate property continues to be passed along to direct
descendants immediately if there is no will.

   The country's two main opposition parties
have formed a pre-election alliance to try to prevent Prime
Minister Charles Haughey from winning his first outright
parliamentary majority.
   The Fine Gael and Labor parties, faring poorly in opinion polls
against Haughey's governing Fianna Fail party, announced during the
weekend that they were combining forces for the June 15 general
election.
   If elected, they pledged to cut income taxes, increase
investment in health services and reduce public borrowing from 5
percent to 3 percent of gross national product.
   Fianna Fail will form the first single-party majority government
since 1977 if its 50 percent-plus approval rating in recent opinion
polls is reflected in the election.
   Haughey, 63, has won and lost office twice, but has never led
his party to a majority in the Dail, or Parliament.

   Employees at an elegant mall have not been
able to figure out why a duck chose a planter outside the complex
to prepare for motherhood, but they're making her comfortable as
she sits on her nine eggs.
   ``We have a layette all planned out, and a shower in the
works,'' said Mary Ellen Brigman, who works at Saks Fifth Avenue at
the Somerset Mall. ``And a makeover. After nine kids at once, she's
going to need it.''
   The duck has spent about a month at the mall sitting on her eggs.
   When the eggs hatch in about two or three weeks, the Humane
Society may move the duck and her brood to a nearby lake.
   No one is sure why the duck moved to the mall.
   ``Maybe she's a country duck who wants to be citified,'' said
Magda Marudas, a personnel supervisor for Saks. ``Or just a classy

   The big cheese is back.
   The ``Belle of Wisconsin,'' a mammoth, 20-ton block of cheddar
cheese, has returned home after a yearlong tour of the United
States.
   The cheese _ measuring 20 feet long, 6 feet wide and 6 feet tall
and weighing 40,060 pounds _ arrived in Milwaukee this weekend
after touring 350 cities in 36 states.
   ``In the metropolitan areas, they didn't care much for it. There
was so much else going on,'' said Pat Patterson, 59, who drove the
Belle's custom-made semi-trailer truck some 55,000 miles in the
last year.
   ``But in the outlying areas and in the suburbs there was a real
good reaction, especially among the children,'' he said. ``Some of
them asked questions like `How much milk did it take?' or `How many
cows did it take?'''
   The Belle will begin a second tour of Wisconsin later this week
that will end at the State Fair in August. The block will then be
sliced into one-pound chunks and sold around the country.
   Created by cheesemaker Dave Simon, of Little Chute, in March
1988 and sponsored by the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board, the Belle
was marketed as the largest block of cheese ever.
   Wisconsin is the No. 1 cheese producer in the country, with an
annual output of more than 1.9 billion pounds.

   Former Sen. S.I. Hayakawa was
hospitalized after complaining of breathing difficulties and
weakness, but tests failed to uncover any serious health problems,
hospital officials said.
   Hayakawa, 82, was admitted to Marin General Hospital on Friday.
He was in stable condition Sunday and was expected to be released
within a few days, said nursing supervisor Marilyn Snyder.
   Hayakawa gained recognition as a conservative in 1969 when as
acting president of San Francisco State University he called in
police to repress anti-war protests on campus. He was president of
the university until 1973.
   The semantics expert known for his trademark tam-o'-shanter won
his Senate seat as a Republican in 1976, and served one six-year
term.
   He lives in Mill Valley north of San Francisco.

   Joe Clark, the disciplinarian high school
principal portrayed in the movie ``Lean on Me,'' underwent surgery
to replace a heart valve and was in satisfactory condition,
hospital officials said.
   Clark, principal of Eastside High School in Paterson, was
recovering in the cardiac care unit of Beth Israel Hospital,
hospital spokesman Tom Casey said Sunday.
   Clark, 52, who gained national recognition for his
bat-and-bullhorn method of discipline at the school, was admitted
to the hospital Wednesday with a high fever, officials said.
   Surgery was necessary to remove bacteria from the heart valve
and prevent the infection from spreading to other organs, said
Clark's cardiologist, Dr. Sharlene Watts.
   One of Clark's aortic valves was replaced with an artificial
valve during four hours of surgery, Casey said.

   Reclusive country music star Don

about in years.
   ``I don't know if I tried any harder on this one. But I will say
we had more fun in the studio than ever, which was delightful,''
Williams said recently.
   Williams gave 80 concerts in 1982, cut back to 50 in 1985, then
retreated altogether for 18 months to his 90-acre farm about 10
miles northwest of Nashville.
   ``I was feeling like, maybe it's time for me to hang it up. You
know, just forget it,'' Williams said.
   His new album, ``One Good Well,'' has already yielded a hit with
the title tune. Williams' other hits include ``The Shelter of Your
Eyes,'' ``We Should Be Together,'' and ```Til the Rivers All Run
Dry.''
   Williams' songs have been recorded by musicians as diverse as
Eric Clapton, Johnny Cash, Pete Townsend, Kenny Rogers and Charley
Pride.

<TEXT>
   Provincial authorities, political
parties and labor unions handed out free groceries to poor families
Sunday in an effort to stop the looting of food stores.
   Argentina has runaway inflation and food prices are soaring.
More than 50 cases of looting were reported last week in four of
the largest cities _ Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Rosaria and Mendoza.
   Edgardo Soto, Rosario's public safety director, said 10 food
markets were attacked by looters Sunday. No arrests were reported.
   Police elsewhere said the number of looting incidents had
diminished.
   Political uncertainty has fueled the economic crisis and
President Raul Alfonsin urged Argentines to support a package of
emergency measures designed to control an ``extremely dangerous and
cruelly damaging'' economic situation.
   Alfonsin announced the measures in a 35-minute televised address
Sunday night. They include exchange controls, tax increases and
cuts in government spending.
   His government is trying to deal with inflation that is expected
to exceed 60 percent in May alone, a plunge in the value of the
local currency that has lost 90 percent of its value in the last
three months and deteriorating salaries.
   Alfonsin called the economic measures ``absolutely necessary''
to ensure an orderly transfer of power from his administration to
that of President-elect Carlos Menem scheduled for Dec. 10.
   ``We are willing to modify some of our criteria'' to fit Menem's
plan, Alfonsin said.
   His Radical Civic Union lost elections May 14 to Menem's
Peronist Party.
   Alfonsin said the free monetary exchange system will be replaced
by one controlled by the government. He gave no details.
   Newspapers have suggested the Argentine austral will be pegged
at between 160 and 170 per dollar for import and export operations.
The dollar has topped 200 australs recently on the free exchange
market.
   Export taxes will be increased by 10 percent to a total of 30
percent for agricultural exports and 20 percent for industrial
exports, the president said.
   He said the government will cut spending and sign no new
contracts for public works, and radio and television stations
operated by the state will be privatized. Three of the nation's
five main television channels have been under government control
since 1974..
   Alfonsin also said travel by government officials will be
strictly limited and he will cancel a scheduled visit to France.
   The government will not set maximum prices for consumer goods
but will continue the policy under which prices may not be
increased without specific government approval, the president said.
   In the industrial city of Cordoba the provincial government
began distributing 10,000 rations daily of pasta, bread and milk in
``Operation Solidarity.''
   Provincial Social Affairs Minister Ruben Marti said the program
would continue until ``the financial-economic situation
stabilizes.'' He said the food was furnished from government stocks
and by political parties, labor unions and private businesses.
   Food stores in Cordoba were guarded by police and members of a
border guard unit called to special duty by Gov. Eduardo Angeloz.
   The provincial government said about 200 people had been
arrested in connection with least 40 cases of looting of
supermarkets and grocery stores.
   The United Left, a coalition of political parties in Cordoba,
accused provincial authorities of ``resorting to repression to halt
the reply that popular sectors have begun to give to the crisis,
mobilizing themselves to combat their misery.''
   The looting of markets began Tuesday in Cordoba and by Friday
had spread to other cities.
   The number of lootings had diminished by Saturday but police
reported several incidents in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area.
   The newspaper La Nacion reported Sunday that from May 26, 1988,
to the same date this year the price of 2.2 pounds of potatoes went
up 3,233 percent and there were increases of 900 percent for 2.2
pounds of flank steak and 2,079 percent for a dozen eggs.

<HEAD>Poll: Bush Popular Despite Slow Start</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush is off to a slow start in his four
months as president, say 59 percent of Americans surveyed by ABC
News and The Washington Post.
   The survey also determined that slightly more than half of the
respondents felt Bush was lacking ``clear goals where he wants to
lead the country'' or were uncertain whether he has a plan.
   According to the survey, published in Monday's editions of the
newspaper, 47 percent felt Bush had clear goals, 43 percent said
no, and 10 percent said they didn't know.
   Of those who said Bush was off to a slow start, 79 percent said
they were concerned about it. Still, two in three people approve of
the way Bush is doing his job, the survey said.
   The telephone survey was conducted May 12-16 by ICR Survey
Research Group of Media, Pa., and had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Women Lead Top Four Texas Cities as Azar Wins El Paso Mayoral Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayors of the four biggest cities in
Texas will be women when Suzie Azar, who buried her opponent in a
weekend runoff, takes office June 12.
   Mrs. Azar joined Kathy Whitmire of Houston, Annette Strauss of
Dallas and Lila Cockrell of San Antonio on the list of big-city
Texas mayors by defeating fellow City Council member Ed Elsey in
Saturday's election.
   Mrs. Azar will be the first female mayor for this desert city of
more than 500,000.
   ``One hundred seventeen years is a long time for El Paso to wait
(for a woman mayor), and I'm glad they waited for me,'' Mrs. Azar
said shortly after Elsey conceded defeat Saturday night.
   The suspense was over minutes after the polls closed, when
results of the 19,000 absentee ballots were released: Mrs. Azar
collected about 63 percent.
   Final, unofficial vote totals had Mrs. Azar with 65 percent of
the vote to 35 percent for Elsey. Mrs. Azar received 29,961 votes
to Elsey's 16,218.
   ``When you get a margin like 65 percent, that's a mandate from
the people that they're willing to work with you,'' Mrs. Azar said.
   ``I want to congratulate her on a campaign well-run,'' Elsey
said. ``I'm getting ready to get back to business and maybe doing
some hunting and fishing.''
   Shortly after Elsey and Mrs. Azar defeated four other candidates
May 6 to make it to Saturday's runoff, Elsey likened himself to a
coach and Mrs. Azar to a cheerleader.
   He was criticized for that remark, but Mrs. Azar, 42, embraced
the characterization Saturday night, when about a dozen
cheerleaders from various high schools kept their pompons shaking
at her campaign headquarters.
   Mrs. Azar said her first priority will be bringing higher-paying
jobs to El Paso, one of the poorest cities in the United States. El
Paso has a tax base of $10.4 billion, considered small for a city
its size.
   El Paso elections are non-partisan. Mrs. Azar is a Democrat and
Elsey is a Republican.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Bush's
remarks upon arrival Sunday evening at Brussels International
Airport for the NATO summit:
   It is really a pleasure to be back, once again, in Brussels, and
I'm especially pleased that my first visit as president of the
United States comes as the nations of NATO celebrate 40 years of
alliance, and the longest period of peace and freedom that Europe
has known in the modern age.
   Americans and Belgians share the memories of war and hard-won
peace in this century.
   Flanders, the battle of Ardennes, Bastogne _ those names are
part of our history as well as your own, part of our shared
heritage of freedom and the sacrifices it requires.
   Belgium, no stranger to conquest and division, recognized from
the first the importance of alliance in the postwar world, and
today, as permanent home to NATO and the European community,
Brussels stands at the center of a Europe free, at peace and
prosperous as never before, a Europe that is steadily moving
towards a single market, and unprecedented political and economic
opportunities.
   In Brussels, the signs of this European renaissance are
everywhere. Belgium has been a good friend and a valued ally, one
that has always acted with alliance interests in mind. Early in
this decade, Belgium was one of five NATO nations that made the
difficult decision to base INF systems on its own soil. And those
deployments gave us the leverage that we needed to negotiate the
first ever nuclear arms reduction treaty, indeed one that banned an
entire generation of nuclear weapons.
   That's the kind of courageous and realistic approach that
explains NATO's success. NATO is at once ready to ensure the common
defense, and to reduce arms, and seek to diminish tensions with the
East.
   As I've said a number of times, we seek to move to a policy
beyond containment. We want to see an end to the division of Europe
and we want to see it ended on the basis of Western values. We will
join Western European nations in encouraging the process of change
in the Soviet Union, pointing to the day when the Soviet Union will
be welcomed as a constructive participant in the community of free
nations.
   I'm looking forward to important discussions with the King of
the Belgians, King Baudouin, and the NATO heads of government. I
look forward, as well, to my meeting with Prime Minister Martens,
my friend, my discussions also with Mr. Delors of the European
Community, and Secretary General Woerner at NATO.
   The future of NATO depends on the alliance's ability to deal
with our enduring security concerns, and our evolving economic
relationship, We look to Belgium to continue to play its important
role in our close, and cooperative transatlantic partnership. I am
delighted to be back, and thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for this
warm welcome.

   U.S. officials on the eve of the NATO summit
reiterated the administration's belief that an agreement on
conventional forces should take precedence over reducing the number
the number of short-range nuclear weapons in West Germany and the
Warsaw Pact.
   But the officials, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Secretary
of State James A. Baker III, also said they believed the alliance
could have a successful summit without a resolution of the nuclear
weapons issue.
   ``Short-range nuclear forces are an essential part of the
deterrent,'' Cheney said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' a Sunday
news program. ``They ought to stay there while we focus on
conventional armaments. After we've dealt with the conventional
problem, then we can come back and talk about short-range forces.
   ``I don't think there's any magic about having to resolve it at
the end of May of 1989.''
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been warning against a delay in talks
between the superpowers over the nuclear weapons with ranges of 300
miles or less.
   Baker, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' said President
Bush is willing to negotiate with the Soviet Union on reducing the
number of nuclear weapons, but he does not feel any pressure to
resolve the problem during this week's 16-nation meeting.
   ``The president has already acknowledged at least the principle
of negotiations, although he feels very, very strongly that before
you can talk about that or get into that, you need to see a
conventional forces agreement,'' Baker said.
   The United States has pushed for modernization of the Lance
missiles while West Germany has urged superpower negotiations to
reduce the weapons, located on German soil.
   U.S. officials now say they are amenable to talks with the
Soviets at an unspecified date, but the United States and Britain
still say those negotiations should not take place while the Warsaw
Pact nations remain superior in conventional forces. The dispute
has created a rift within the NATO alliance.
   Kohl on Saturday said U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the
short-range weapons ``cannot be postponed into the distant future.
We are the front-line country in NATO. It is clear that we should
be speaking up for our interests.''
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft, interviewed on
ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley,'' said elimination of the
short-range weapons would undermine NATO strategy because the
weapons ``are there, in part, to make up for the conventional
imbalance that has existed since the foundation of NATO.''
   While the Western alliances's short-range missile launchers are
based primarily on West German soil, the Warsaw Pact has
short-range weapons in East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia and
Hungary.
   According to Western estimates, the Soviet Union has 1,450
short-range nuclear missile launchers while NATO has 88. The
Soviets are said to have some 3,000 missiles of various types that
could be used on their launchers, while NATO has 700 Lance
single-warhead missiles.
   Overall, according to NATO figures, the Soviets have 6,260
nuclear artillery systems compared to 2,700 for the alliance.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Contract Includes Broad `Family' Benefits, Wage, Pension Boosts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T and its unions are touting a contract
agreement that boosts wages and pension payments while providing
such family related benefits as six months of leave to care for
either newborn children or sick parents and a $5 million fund for
child care.
   ``We realized our people have to balance work and family life if
they are really going to make a contribution,'' AT&amp;T senior vice
president Harold Burlingame said Sunday after the company and
unions reached agreement on three-year contracts covering 160,000
workers.
   Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America,
said the agreement ``features an unprecedented breakthrough in
labor-management relations with respect to family care.''
   Bahr was also speaking on behalf of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the second union covered by the
agreement.
   Both sides agreed to extend the talks beyond the midnight
Saturday deadline. The contract must now be ratified by the union's
rank and file.
   Among concessions were an agreement by the unions to amend
several job classifications in AT&amp;T's favor, and to forgo
cost-of-living adjustments. The company agreed to limits on the use
of temporary workers.
   Highlights of the agreement include:
   _Six months parental leave after the birth of a child, with
employment and seniority guaranteed and all medical insurance paid
by the company. Those same leave and benefit provisions would cover
workers who take time off to care for a sick parent.
   _A $5 million child-care fund, jointly administered by the
company and unions, to support new and existing child care centers
in regions of the country where union members report difficulty
obtaining services.
   _Up to $2,000 from AT&amp;T to workers to help cover the costs of
adoption.
   The contracts also contain a 12 percent benefits increase for
new pensioners, a 5 percent increase in payments for existing
pensions effective Jan. 1, 1991, and a new system to assist workers
seeking transfers or looking for work elsewhere in the company when
existing jobs are eliminated.
   Union workers also for the first time will share in AT&amp;T's
annual profits, receiving 2.5 percent a year. The unions said that
amount would average $700 per person a year based on AT&amp;T's 1988
performance.
   Also, AT&amp;T joined with the unions in forming a committee that
will lobby for legislative and policy changes designed to curb
soaring health care costs.
   The health plan premiums remain fully paid by the company and
the plan retains 100 percent coverage for most services.
   However, the agreement does make it more likely that more
workers will reach the existing $150 annual deductible by exempting
more medical services from so-called ``first dollar'' coverage.
   And the agreement provides that workers will have to pay higher
deductibles and fees if they choose a physician who charges more
than those on a list of ``preferred providers'' who agree to a fee
structure negotiated with the company.
   The contracts are the result of the largest single-employer
collective bargaining this year. They likely will have a
significant impact on contract talks this summer with the so-called
``baby bells'' formed after the 1984 AT&amp;T breakup and other
regional phone companies. In all, 500,000 union workers are
affected by those contracts.
   The national agreement provides operations employees _ primarily
operators, technicians, clerical and administrative staff _ an
immediate 4 percent pay increase, an additional 2.5 percent in the
second year of the contract and 2.25 percent in the final year.
   Manufacturing workers would receive an 8 percent lump sum
payment after ratification and those in skilled trades would get an
additional 50-cents-an-hour. All manufacturing workers would
receive base wage increases of 3.5 percent in the second year of
the contract and 3 percent in the third.
   Members of the CWA, who make up more than 75 percent of the AT&amp;T
workers from the two unions, currently receive a weekly base pay
ranging from $230 to $589.
   It was the first time CWA and IBEW negotiated jointly, an
agreement reached two years after a bitter dispute between the
unions sparked by IBEW's decision not to honor a 26-day CWA strike
in 1986.

<TEXT>
   With House Speaker Jim Wright and one of his
top lieutenants on the way out, Democrats face a week of scrambling
to reshuffle their leadership and to reimpose a sense of mission on
a floundering chamber.
   When lawmakers return from their Memorial Day recess, they will
face one certain resignation _ that of Majority Whip Tony Coelho,
D-Calif. _ and another that is near certain, that of Texas Democrat
Wright.
   It is unprecedented for such a turnover, propelled by concerns
about ethics, to take place in the middle of a legislative session.
The turmoil only adds to Congress' woes over what has so far been a
lackluster year.
   It will be up to Rep. Tom Foley, D-Wash., the majority leader
and heir-apparent to Wright, to turn the disarray into order and to
refocus attention on the institution's primary tasks, dealing with
the budget deficit and with legislation ranging from the
environment to social issues.
   Wright himself spent the weekend in seclusion, believed to be
drafting a message defending himself before stepping down as
speaker. Further pressure on Wright was created by the surprise
resignation, announced Saturday, of Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the
party's No. 3 leadership official.
   ``The Democratic party is not in a crisis,'' Foley said, already
trying to stem the disruption. ``We are going to address the
legislative issues that face the country.''
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Coelho's decision to resign as
Democratic whip effective June 15 was a step in that direction.
Removing his ethics problems from the agenda ``said loudly we need
to get about the business of addressing'' issues like the deficit,
the environment and social concerns.
   ``In the very short term, the party has clearly been hurt,''
Hoyer said. But he added: ``We have a very deep bench'' and will be
able to quickly replace the lost leadership.
   Soon after Wright's expected resignation announcement, which
could come as early as Wednesday, House Democrats will caucus to
elect successors.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is the favorite to replace Foley,
although he may face a challenge from Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga.
Coelho's spot would likely be filled by one of three contenders:
Reps. David Bonior, D-Mich.; Beryl Anthony, D-Ark.; or Bill Gray,
D-Pa.
   It will be up to Foley not only to deal with the ethics cloud
that has enveloped his party, but also to look beyond internal
concerns to a list of legislation that has been overshadowed, if
not neglected.
   Many expect Foley to provide the calming influence the chamber
needs. His personal style is far different from those of both
Wright and Coelho, who are forceful, deal-cutting risk takers.
Foley is seen as more of a consensus politician, more intellectual
and conciliatory.
   But Republicans, who largely have taken a hands-off approach
since the ethics committee formally charged Wright with 69
violations of House rules, now are poised to attack.
   ``There are going to be a number of Democrats in trouble,'' said
Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the GOP whip and Wright's chief accuser.
He contends that in their more than three decades in power in the
House, Democrats have developed ``a habit of sloppiness'' when it
comes to ethics.
   Republicans will put forward an ethics and election reform
package and challenge Foley on the issues, Gingrich said in a
weekend telephone interview.
   ``How can you lose two of your top three people and not admit
you have a problem?'' he asked. ``They have to make a decision
whether they go for reform or decide to protect the machine.''
   However, another senior GOP strategist conceded that it is
difficult to gain partisan advantage from the ethics issue because
Americans tend to see Congress as a single institution, and ethics
charges tend to taint all incumbents, regardless of party.
   Moreover, Gingrich faces his own ethics investigation over a
book promotion deal, and Rep. Donald Lukens, R-Ohio, was convicted
last week on a charge related to his sexual relationship with a
16-year-old girl.
   ``The question is whether they (the Democrats) feel vulnerable
on the issue,'' said the source, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity. ``It's obviously churning.''
   Anthony hinted that as soon as a new leadership team is in
place, Democrats will seek to turn the tables. ``At that point you
would say, `Welcome. Let's see if you can take it like you've been
dishing it out. And we'll now give you an opportunity to see how it
feels.''
   A pall fell over the Capitol last week as candidates in the
Democratic succession race tried to line up support without seeming
to trample over the body of their fallen leader, Wright.
   Sources close to the Texas Democrat said he was determined to
leave office on his own terms. But among considerations in his
decision when to resign was an ethics committee meeting scheduled
for Thursday.
   The panel is to take up a motion filed by Wright's lawyers to
dismiss the most serious charges against him: that he evaded limits
on outside income through bulk sales of a book he wrote, and that
he accepted $145,000 in gifts from a Fort Worth friend with a
direct interest in legislation.
   The committee appeared unlikely to drop the charges, and allies
of the speaker said he would like to forestall any adverse legal
action. That has added weight to the belief that Wright will
announce his decision on Wednesday, when the House returns.

<HEAD>Debt Lingo at International Monetary Fund is Hardly Esperanto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   How to solve the Third World's $1.2 trillion
debt problem?
   In the jargon of the International Monetary Fund, a prescription
might go something like this:
   ``The Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility will maximize
rescheduling potential for the least developed areas, while
set-asides from debtor purchases of the fund's ordinary resources,
in terms of special drawing rights, can be devoted to operations on
the secondary market and a percentage of quotas will be available
for interest support.''
   What?
   The experts tackling the issues of Third World debt really talk
that way. Sometimes, it may be because they are so wrapped up in
their specialty that the terminology seems natural.
   In other cases, someone may be trying to hide something.
   Robert J. Schaetzel, president of a private group known as the
Council for U.S. International Trade policy, says even he often has
trouble understanding what the experts are talking about.
   ``Banks have made unwise loans and don't want to admit it,'' he
said. ``They try to offload the responsibility, either on the
borrowers or on creditor governments. It's a combination: there's
pride in using words few people understand, and you don't bring so
much criticism down on your head.''
   U.S. Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a former diplomat, couldn't resist
putting it this way:
   ``The hocus-pocus of econometrics is analogous to doctor-patient
linguistics, giving the upper hand to the verbosity of verbal
syllablization.''
   Pressed, he acknowledged that ``syllablization'' was his own
invention.
   ``The IMF's particularly arcane language is intended perhaps to
create the mystique that surrounds an enigmatic oracle,'' said
Richard Feinberg, vice-president of the Overseas Development
Council.
   But Rodney Eldridge, professor of international finance at
George Washington University, offered a defense of some of the
jargon. He said new words have to be invented all the time to keep
pace with financial developments. He cited ``securitization,''
meaning the issuance of a new form of bond instead of making a loan.
   ``Five years ago that would not have been a word,'' he said.
``It is now.''
   Some speculate the International Monetary Fund's language has
something to do with the dignity of European bankers, which often
exceeds that of American bankers.
   Since the fund was set up after World War II, it has always been
headed by a banker from Europe. Its sister organization, the World
Bank, has always had an American president. While it too uses
jargon, the bank tends to go in for simpler language and rarely
uses its official title: the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development.
   Now, about how ``the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
will maximize rescheduling potential for the least developed areas,
while set-asides from debtor purchases of the fund's ordinary
resources, in terms of special drawing rights, can be devoted to
operations on the secondary market and a percentage of quotas will
be available for interest support.''
   In something of a translation, that means the fund will have
about $10.5 billion to lend to the poorest countries at almost no
interest. It will ask the rich countries to stop nagging them to
pay old debts, provided the debtors promise to put in new austerity
programs.
   It means further that big debtors like Mexico and Brazil can
also borrow from the fund and use some of the money to buy back
part of their debt at bargain prices, now that almost nobody
expects it to be repaid in full. Some of the borrowed money can be
used to guarantee commercial banks that they'll get the interest
owed to them, at least for a while, on the debt that remains.
   As the IMF jargon factory churns on, another congressman, Rep.
Alfred A. McCandless, R-Calif., has his own formula for U.S.
domestic legislation, perhaps only wishful linguistic thinking,
that he also applies to Third World debt:
   ``There would be no problem if every proposal for spending
started with the words: `We won't spend more than we take in.' ''

<HEAD>Coelho Calls on Bush to Stop `Partisan and Petty Politics'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho, who plans
to resign from Congress rather than face an ethics investigation,
says it's up to President Bush to stop ``partisan and petty
politics'' being practiced by some Republicans.
   Coelho spoke in an interview with CBS television on Sunday, one
day after announcing he will leave Congress on June 15.
   Bush is playing ``good cop'' in talking about cooperation and
bipartisanship, while Republican campaign officials are playing
``bad cops,'' the California Democrat said.
   ``If he wants to do away with the partisan and petty politics
that he talks about, then Mr. President, stand up and say so,''
Coelho said, adding the president should ``stand up and fire those
people who are unwilling to do what you want to have done.''
   Coelho said Republicans wanted him to stay in office to face
ethical questions about his $100,000 junk bond deal in 1986.
   ``The biggest disappointment they have is that they wanted me to
stay in for the next two years so that they could use me as a
vehicle to destroy my party and my causes from going forward,'' the
California Democrat said, according to a transcript of a portion of
the interview that was not broadcast. ``I took that away from them.
... I know what I'm doing.''
   ``Do we make mistakes? Yes we do. Did I make a mistake? Yes I
did. I'm willing to pay for it,'' Coelho said during the broadcast
interview.
   Coelho has steadfastly insisted he did nothing wrong _ aside
from some reporting errors _ in the junk bond transaction, which
was financed without him having to put up any of his own money.
   Before Saturday, Coelho was planning to run for House majority
leader to replace Rep. Tom Foley, who is expected to become speaker
upon the expected resignation of Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, who
also faces ethical questions.
   Coelho told CBS that he believes House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of
Georgia is trying to ``create a political agenda to try to get
control of the United States House of Representatives.
   ``Newt has said the only way for Republicans to get control is
to destroy the institution, tear it down and then to rebuild it,''
Coelho said. ``I don't think the American public wants that.''

<HEAD>Experts Debate Effect of Public Service Ads Against Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman's face appears on the television
screen with a car, a stereo, and a house disappearing up her nose
like a stream of cocaine. A tear eventually streams down her cheek.
   In another public service announcement, comedian and talk show
host Arsenio Hall interviews drug addicts, one as young as 13,
about how their lives went off track.
   One of the most familiar anti-drug ads depicts a fried egg
sizzling and burning as an ominous voice intones: ``This is your
brain on drugs.''
   TV networks have provided millions of dollars worth of free air
time to broadcast these announcements produced free-of-charge by
advertisers.
   But do they do any good?
   The advertising agencies think they do, according to the
Media-Advertising Partnership for a Drug-Free America and its
sister organization, The Advertising Council, which organize many
of the ad efforts.
   William J. Bennett, the director of the Office of National Drug
Control Policy, also believes they help, and the producer of a
survey on high school drug abuse credits the ads with reducing that
abuse.
   But others say the ads are ineffective and a waste of money.
   Don Des Jarlais, an epidemiologist who works with heroin and
cocaine addicts in New York City, said addicts speak ``derisively''
of the ads when they refer to them at all.
   ``The preliminary data I've seen indicate they do change some
attitudes, but in terms of actually changing drug use, that remains
to be seen,'' he said.
   Donald Streater, a 17-year heroin addict who quit 13{ years ago,
earned a law degree and now works for the House Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control, said, ``I would like to see some of
that money going into treatment programs instead.''
   Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television,
contended the ads are ``conscience money for a society that is not
taking care of that part of the population that's most likely to
get involved in drugs.''
   ``It makes the ad industry feel it's OK to advertise the
products of their clients in programs that glamorize crime in the
streets, violence against women and the culture that gives rise to
drug dealing,'' she said.
   Theresa Venet Grant of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America
rejected that contention, saying programs such as ``21 Jump
Street,'' ``Growing Pains'' and ``Family Ties'' are making a
``conscious effort to deglamorize drug use.''
   But an academic who has studied the ratio of pro-drug to
anti-drug messages on television said TV is delivering too many
mixed messages for the anti-drug ads to have an impact.
   The ratio is 8 to 1 in favor of pro-drug messages, including
programs and advertisements showing people smoking, drinking or
taking medicines, said John Condry, a Cornell University professor
who has spent the past year at the Center for Research on the
Influences of Television on Children at the University of Kansas at
Lawrence.
   Even legitimate ads for over-the-counter pain medications send
the wrong message, he contended.
   ``While it's not illegal, what they are saying is if you don't
like the state you're in, if you have a headache, you take a drug
... take some sort of substance to change how you feel,'' Condry
said.
   Charles Atkin, a Michigan State University professor who has
analyzed the impact of public service announcements, including
anti-alcohol ads, said, ``Probably the main effect (of the
anti-drug ads) is to assure the non-drug users that something is
being done.''
   On the other hand, Lloyd D. Johnston, program director for the
Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan at Ann
Arbor, singled out the advertising campaigns for praise.
   Young people ``report a very high level of recalled exposure to
the anti-drug advertising, a high degree of credibility in the
content, and most important, a high judged impact on their own
drug-using behaviors and attitudes,'' Johnston wrote to the
Partnership for a Drug-Free America.

<HEAD>Split Military Narrowly Avoids Clash</HEAD>
<UNK>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The armed forces, deeply
divided over who should direct the war against leftist rebels,
narrowly avoided an internal clash last week before agreeing on a
compromise defense minister, according to well-informed sources.
   The discord has been only cosmetically overcome, and the rivalry
will again come to a head within months after a new government
takes office Thursday, the sources said this weekend.
   Most of the military, diplomatic and political sources consulted
in the matter spoke on condition of anonymity. But outgoing
president Jose Napoleon Duarte and an army colonel acknowledged
publicly that an atmosphere of crisis prevailed last week during
the high command's deliberations.
   The air force, whose commander was one of two top candidates to
head the Defense Ministry, halted ground support operations at
midweek and limited itself to evacuating wounded, sources said.
   They said some air force officers had expected armor-backed army
troops to move on Ilopango Air Base, the air force headquarters,
last Thursday.
   Maneuvering for the Defense Ministry post reportedly included
harsh mutual recriminations between air force chief Gen. Rafael
Bustillo and the other top candidate, Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, head
of the joint chiefs of staff.
   In a reported shouting match, they accused each other of
fostering or ignoring corruption in their respective ranks.
   The high command finally agreed that Gen. Humberto Larios,
currently vice-minister of defense, should take over as minister
after President-elect Alfredo Cristiani is sworn in Thursday.
   Cristiani heads the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or
Arena.
   Larios will replace Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova, who reportedly
will go to West Germany as military attache.
   Cristiani, who preferred Bustillo for the post but ceded at the
prospect of internal battle, has accepted Larios, at least
temporarily, the sources said.
   According to the constitution, the president names his Cabinet.
But civilian authority in El Salvador remains conditioned on
military approval and tutelage, especially in defense matters.
   The confrontation is not a simple showdown between the air force
and army. If it were, the army, with its superior force, would have
succeeded in imposing Ponce.
   Several key army colonels with command of troops back Bustillo,
the sources said. Those who back the airman contend he is more of a
natural leader, more of a nationalist and has greater resolve than
Ponce to do what is necessary to win the 9-year-old civil war.
   Bustillo is considered a virulently anti-communist hardliner
relatively unconcerned about international criticism for human
rights abuses.
   Ponce is seen as an exponent of continuing the same, or slightly
modified, Low Intensity Warfare strategy pursued to date.
   Despite more than $800 million in U.S. military aid this decade,
the 56,000-strong armed forces has been unable to defeat an
insurgent force estimated to number 7,000 combatants and 14,000
militia members.
   The war has claimed the lives of an estimated 70,000 people,
most of them civilians.
   The sources said the U.S. Embassy, which wields considerable
leverage in El Salvador, staunchly backed Ponce then proposed
Larios as a compromise.
   ``In all institutions, there is an element of institutional
crisis when the government changes,'' Duarte told reporters
Saturday of rumors of the military turmoil. ``Everyone tries to
ensure his post. This means that at the distinct levels of the
armed forces, there are expressions of defense of interests in the
effort to conform to the change.''
   Col. Benjamin Canjura, commander of a provincial garrison, told
Radio YSU on Friday that tension was high in the military over the
defense ministry fight.
   Opponents of Arena contend Cristiani, a suave U.S.-educated
businessman, is little more than a palatable facade on what they
say is a neo-fascist organization. They claim he is subordinate to
hardliners.
   The incumbent Christian Democrats used the slogan ``Cristiani
doesn't run things,'' prior to the March 19 presidential election,
in which Duarte's party was trounced.
   Canjura said that despite Cristiani's acceptance of Larios other
high-ranking Arena officials insist on Bustillo.
   ``This a chance for Cristiani to show if he runs things or
not,'' said Canjura.

<HEAD>Two Killed As Train Rams Into Railroad Cars in Amarillo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMARILLO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A slow-moving freight carrying California
fruit to Chicago rammed 30 parked railroad cars, killing the
brakeman and conductor and injuring two other workers.
   The accident before dawn Sunday flung one of the parked cars
into a coal train traveling in the opposite direction. No one
aboard the 110-car coal train was injured, said Wayne Beighle of
the state Department of Public Safety.
   He said it was remarkable anyone had survived in the eastbound
train.
   ``It looked like the front three-quarters of that engine were
cut in half,'' Beighle said.
   ``I see the devastating damage at 20 mph, I can only imagine
what it would have been like at higher speeds,'' he said.
   Beighle said investigators determined the 35-car train that
slammed into the parked cars was traveling at 20 mph and the brakes
had been applied when the accident occurred as the train entered
Amarillo city limits.
   ``Evidently, they thought the track was clear,'' Beighle said.
``That's still under investigation.''
   Both trains involved were operated by Santa Fe Railway. The
engines damaged in the accident were owned by Burlington Northern.
   DPS investigators and Santa Fe officials interviewed witnesses
Sunday. The National Transportation Safety Board also will
investigate the rail accident because deaths were involved.
   Santa Fe officials said the railroad had not had an accident in
the Amarillo area in recent years.
   Most of the parked railroad cars contained what Santa Fe
officials said was a common, non-hazardous agricultural chemical,
which they did not identify. Several of the cars were empty.
   The two railroad employees killed were identified as brakeman
Steve R. Favreau, 29, and conductor Robert N. Dawson, 44.
   The train's engineer, R.H. Coleman, 57, was listed in critical
condition with multiple injuries Sunday evening after several hours
of surgery. A.H. Zermeno, 41, was listed in satisfactory condition,
said a hospital nursing supervisor.
   All were from the Amarillo area, authorities said.

   Tujan Khalid says he feels more
comfortable in the mountains, where for nearly a decade he and 800
Moslem guerrillas battled the Soviet-backed government.
   But now the rebel commander is plying his own brand of politics
in Afghanistan, where shifting military fortunes sent the
once-Marxist government seeking support among groups it once
considered enemies.
   Khalid joined the resistance at age 24, following firebrand
rebel leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
   When the Soviet Red Army left Afghanistan, Khalid switched his
allegiance and pledged to intercede with other guerrilla commanders
to help try to stop the jihad, or holy war.
   He says it is no longer justified since the government, once
hostile to Moslem tenets, is now an active backer of the faith.
   ``This cannot be called jihad. This is not according to Islam,
to continue war and bloodshed,'' says the bearded Khalid, dressed
in a turban and robe. ``We are all brothers. We belong to
Afghanistan.''
   With the Afghan armed forces left to fight alone, the government
of President Najib has come under intensive military pressure, with
guerrillas encircling the eastern city of Jalalabad and fighting
around the southern towns of Kandahar and Khost.
   Thousands of reservists have been called for military duty and
shipments of Soviet arms and ammunition stepped up. The United
States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China are arming and training
the guerrillas.
   Political and military analysts say they believe the government
forces will be able to hold the cities against the divided,
ill-prepared guerrillas. However, they add, there is little
prospect for the government winning the war.
   Najib is trying to create a new political image aimed at
strengthening his government's support at home. That policy took on
a new urgency with the final departure of the Soviet troops on Feb.
15.
   On May 21, Najib launched a new drive to try to end the
11-year-old war, offering deals to a dozen guerrilla commanders,
including three of the best known and most organized commanders _
Ahmed Shah Masood, Ismail Khan and Abdul Haq.
   The 43-year-old president offered them full military rank within
the Afghan army, said they could keep their weapons and promised
autonomy in the regions they control. But his offer was rejected
within 24 hours.
   ``They made a big mistake,'' said Khalid, who had come to Kabul
to attend a meeting of the Loya Jirgah, the centuries-old tribal
council in Afghanistan, where Najib made the offer. ``I hope they
will reconsider. I do not want to see our country being cut into
pieces.''
   Diplomats and government officials say the government has had
some success in opening secret talks with the guerrillas since the
Soviet departure. At least one commander is known to have made
contact with the government and one Pakistan-based guerrilla leader
is reported to have been talking with the government for several
months.
   But most commanders, while holding back on launching a major
offensive, appear to be content to wait and see if an outright
military victory by either side is possible, they say.
   Although the government has had some scattered success, many
Afghans seem unwilling to forgive it for the hardships and
suffering brought by a war that has claimed at least 1.3 million
lives and forced more than 5 million others to seek refuge in Iran
and Pakistan.
   The groups whose backing are now being sought were among the
first casualities when civil war broke out after Marxists seized
power in an April 1978 coup.
   The government is now undertaking a major effort to do away with
some of the policies that once trampled on Moslem tenets.
   For some Afghans the changes have been cosmetic because the real
power still remains with the Politburo and the promise of new
freedom has been tempered by the continued activites of the KHAD _
the Soviet-style secret police.
   But the guerrillas and their supporters say they are unwilling
to seek reconciliation as long as Najib and his People's Democratic
Party of Afghanistan cling to office.
   ``All sides need to openly ask questions about what they are
doing and why,'' said Khalid. ``But they don't seem to know what to
do. There are too many arms and too much money, and there will be a
lot more bloodshed. And the end result could be a disaster.''

<TEXT>
   This year's Memorial Day Weekend
celebration of the internal combustion engine was disrupted by the
hum of tiny cars of the future.
   It took Ed Passerini's solar-powered car four days to cover the
distance that Emerson Fittipaldi, the Indianapolis 500 winner,
zipped over about once an hour Sunday. But Passerini, who finished
first in Sunday's American Tour de Sol, scoffed off the comparison.
   ``The Indy 500 is a relic of the past,'' said the professor of
environmental studies and humanities at the University of Alabama
in Tuscaloosa. ``In the Year 2000 and beyond, this is the sort of
thing we're going to be driving.''
   Sponsors of the four-day road race said it was intended to test
a technology that its pioneers expect will become commonplace.
   ``What this race is really about is ... developing the (solar)
commuter car,'' said Nancy Hazard, of the Northeast Solar Energy
Association, a 15-year-old non-profit organization in Brattleboro,
Vt.
   The 208-mile Tour de Sol began Thursday in Montpelier, Vt., and
wended its way for a couple of hours each morning through New
Hampshire and Massachusetts, taking small highways all the way.
   The race was modeled on the Swiss Tour de Sol, an annual,
international event first held in 1985 that aims to establish the
use of solar power for commuter cars that can travel about 50 miles
a day, Hazard said.
   The six entrants in the American Tour de Sol were teams from
Alabama, MIT, New Hampshire Technical Institute in Concord,
Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., and Worcester Polytechnic
Institute.
   Two cars were in the commuter class and resembled truncated
sedans. The others were racers: low to the ground, their bodies
narrow like a cocoon and topped with flat solar-panel roofs.
   All were equipped with panels of photovoltaic cells that convert
sunlight into electricity to run electric motors and charge their
batteries.
   There were breakdowns and false starts. One car only competed
Sunday. Another was on the road each of the four days but was
dragged part of the way on a trailer because it lacked enough
electric storage. Another needed charging by conventional
electricity overnight.
   But it didn't really matter, because the purpose was to
demonstrate efficiency and reliability, organizers said.
   About 50 onlookers watched as Passerini's vehicle rolled across
the finish line at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at
10:50 a.m.
   Weighing aout 800 pounds, his three-wheeled plastic car was
cobbled together from a trailer hitch, a two-seat yellow paddle
boat fitted with a steering wheel, brake pedals and topped with a
navy blue molded Fibreglas cabin complete with windows. Solar
panels covered the rear of the vehicle and four conventional car
batteries soaked up the electricity.
   Passerini said his car cost $2,800 and took three weeks to
build. It clocked up to 45 mph on the straightaways, 13 mph on the
hills and could travel 30 miles per day.
   Fittipaldi, the Indy 500 winner, averaged 167.581 mph.
   ``This demonstrates that when the oil runs out, the photovoltaic
cell is going to come in for things like transportation,''
Passerini said.
   By contrast, there was the sleeker 350-pound race car driven by
MIT mechanical engineering student James Worden and financed with
$20,000 from a corporate sponsor.
   When Worden sailed in at about 11:20 a.m., first to arrive in
the race car division, the crowd cheered. But helmeted and under a
bubble cockpit, the 22-year-old driver apparently forgot to cross
the finish line. As he began to climb out of the vehicle, he looked
puzzled as the crowd urged him to make it official. When he could
make out what they were saying, he drove ahead a few more feet to
complete his feat to more applause and cheers.

   The U.S. confrontation with Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega may leave the Panama Canal without an
administrator next year, when treaties call for a Panamanian
citizen to take over.
   The canal is run by the Panama Canal Commission, a U.S.
government agency, and now has a U.S. administrator.
   According to the gradual transfer of responsibilities specified
in the 1977 treaties a Panamanian, proposed by the Panamanian
government and appointed by the U.S. president, must take over on
Jan. 1, 1990.
   ``But most likely, if the situation continues we will see the
U.S. deputy administrator running the canal,'' said Fernando
Manfredo, who is generally acknowledged as the Panamanian best
qualified to take over.
   Manfredo helped negotiate the Panama Canal treaties and since
1979 has been deputy administrator _ which becomes a U.S. citizen's
post next year.
   The idea of a Panamanian appointed by Noriega taking over the
canal has aroused opposition in the United States.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has called it ``inconceivable that
the American people, directly or through a marionette, would allow
Noriega to appoint an administrator for the canal.''
   Although the treaty does not say so, a U.S. law passed in 1979
also requires that the new Panamanian administrator be approved by
the U.S. Senate.
   The United States does not recognize the Noriega-controlled
government and has imposed economic sanctions on Panama that
include the withholding of canal income. The United States has
demanded Noriega's ouster and indicted him on drug charges last
year.
   Noriega has also been criticized by the Organization of American
States after the government nullified the May 7 presidential
election and Noriega supporters beat the top three opposition
candidates.
   International observers say the opposition won the election.
   Under the canal treaties, the United States is charged with
protection and defense of the waterway. It recently sent in
additional military units.
   Manfredo and administrator Dennis McAuliffe end their terms on
Dec. 31. If Noriega is still firmly entrenched, it is unlikely
Washington would approve a new adminstrator.
   That would be interpreted by Panama as a treaty violation, since
the treaties do not say that the U.S. president has any choice in
approving the new administrator and do not mention Senate approval.
   Manfredo might be the one person who could get U.S. approval,
but he says he is not available.
   ``I'd rather be surfing in Hawaii,'' Manfredo said in a recent
interview with The Associated Press.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, during his visit earlier this
month as an election observer, asked Manfredo to stay on as
administrator, according to sources close the Canal Commission.
   ``He is the only Panamanian now who, because of his experience
and honesty, would get immediate U.S. approval,'' said a Panamanian
source.
   Carter's word carries particular weight here because he signed
the treaties that cede the canal to Panama at the end of 1999.
   But being the first Panamanian canal administrator, in charge of
a $450 million budget and 8,825 employees _ including 1,100 U.S.
citizens _ would be a tough one even under normal conditions.
   The administrator answers to a Canal Commission Board of
Directors made up of four Panamanians and five U.S. citizens, but
the board has little power to fight Washington or congressional
decisions.
   As a Panamanian, the new administrator also would be facing
pressures from his own government.
   ``There would the distrust of the gringos on the one hand and
the pressure for favors from Panamanians on the other. They would
feel the canal was already a national operation even though it
would still be run as a U.S. agency,'' a source said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Jorge Batlle, whose family has
provided Uruguay with three presidents, won the presidential
nomination for the majority faction of the governing Colorado Party
in a primary election.
   With 95 percent of the votes counted, the party announced that
Batlle had tallied 171,117 votes or 54.9 percent on Sunday,
compared with 124,218, or 39.85 percent for Vice President Enrique
Tarigo.
   Batlle, 62, will represent the party's faction in the Nov. 26
election. The same faction had backed President Julio Sanguinetti,
whose five-year term expires on March 1, 1990. Sanguinetti took
over in 1985 after 12 years of military rule.
   Under Uruguayan law, individual parties may field more than one
candidate for the presidency.
   Battle stressed that Uruguay take a ``qualitative leap forward''
through liberalization of its economy. He also proposed sale of
Uruguay's gold reserves to obtain funds to pay part of the
country's foreign debt.
   Uruguay's $6.1 billion foreign debt and interest payments of
$300 million per year are largely responsible for the deficit and
an annual inflation rate of 79 percent, Batlle said. The country
has $1 billion in gold reserves.
   Batlle's family has a long tradition in Uruguayan politics. His
father, Luis Batlle, great uncle, Jose Batlle, and great
grandfather, Gen. Lorenzo Batlle, all were presidents.
   Batlle will join seven other candidates already selected for the
race to succeed Sanguinetti.
   They include former President Jorge Pacheco Areco, who will
represent a minority faction of the Colorado Party, and three
candidates for the leading opposition National Party, Senators
Alberto Zumaran, Carlos Julio Pereyra and Luis A. Lacalle.
   The candidate for the leftist coalition Broad Front will be
retired army Gen. Liber Seregni. The Peoples' Party for Government,
a social democrat group, will be represented by Sen. Hugo Batalla
and the Green-Ecology Party by Rodolfo Talice, a 90-year-old
specialist on animal behavior.

<HEAD>Hurricane Forecasters Worry About Protecting Growing Coastal Populations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRACY FIELDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forecasters preparing for Thursday's
opening of the Atlantic hurricane season wish they could predict
the arrival of new technological help they say may be crucial to
ever-growing coastal populations.
   The Air Force has agreed to fly hurricane reconnaissance flights
for two more years, but has made it clear it plans to phase out the
missions. And only one satellite is available for tracking
hurricanes.
   ``We just have nothing right now to lean on,'' says Ken
McKinnon, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Tom Lewis of North Palm Beach,
Fla., who has introduced a bill in Congress to keep hurricane
hunters flying at least another five years. ``We've got one
satellite and they're telling us it'll do the job. If it blinks,
how do you track weather?''
   The Air Force doesn't want to be involved. ``We have in the last
few years examined our need for manned weather reconnaissance and
feel there's no real compelling military reason,'' said spokesman
Lt. Col. Darrell Hayes.
   ``We're not disputing that the hurricane center and the weather
service need the data. We're just saying there may be more
appropriate agencies to provide the information,'' he said, adding
that the service had approached the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration about taking over the flights.
   Besides the flights, forecasters depend on radar and satellite
data.
   The single working weather satellite wasn't intended to be
alone. A second satellite failed, and a replacement for the failed
craft was blown up in a mishap on the launch pad, forcing
forecasters to make do.
   There are new satellites on the horizon, says Bob Sheets,
director of the National Hurricane Center. But they've been due for
a long time and aren't expected before late 1990.
   ``It is a major concern for us,'' Sheets said.
   Forecasters also are worried about a shift in the pattern of
hurricane activity in recent years. Since 1985, Sheets said, there
seem to be more hurricanes and they're more likely to hit the
United States.
   ``We may be in an upswing,'' he said, ``possibly back to the
pattern of the '40s, '50s and '60s when we had a tremendous number
of landfall hurricanes.''
   Max Mayfield, hurricane specialist at the National Weather
Service in Miami, said experts don't known enough yet about
hurricanes to tell if this is just a peak in activity, or a return
to the 50s and 60s.
   ``Now we can see past the Antilles out into the Atlantic, and
over toward Hawaii on the west,'' said forecaster Hal Gerrish.
``We'd like to be able to see all the way to Africa,'' which is
where Atlantic hurricanes develop, he said.
   The need for improved tracking systems is important because more
and more people are moving to coastal locations likely to be
affected by storms.
   ``I spoke to about 5,000 people on the west coast of Florida,''
Sheets said. ``Ninety-plus percent of them were from the Midwest or
Northeast and had just come to Florida. They really have very
little concept of what a hurricane is.''
   During the average Atlantic hurricane season, which stretches
from June through the end of November, six tropical storms will
grow into hurricanes, with heavy rains and winds of 74 mph.
   Donna, in 1960, struck the Florida Keys at Marathon, then raked
across Naples and Fort Myers before weakening inland.
   Last season, 505 people died in Atlantic hurricanes, including
Gilbert and Joan.
   Gilbert killed more than 300 people and did heavy damage in
Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic as it blasted
across the the western Caribbean and part of the Gulf of Mexico _
including the Florida Keys, the Florida Straits and Cuba.
   Joan hovered off the coast of Central America for days before
howling in with top winds of 135 mph. The storm caused mudslides,
floods and other damage in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Colombia and
Panama.

<HEAD>Probe: How Did Mental Patient Smuggle Gun, Knives Aboard Jet?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While a Cuban exile awaited a court appearance in
the attempted hijack of an American Airlines jet, authorities tried
to figure out how he smuggled a starter gun and two knives on the
plane.
   Pedro Rene Comas-Benos, an escaped mental patient wearing green
military fatigues and a bomber-style jacket, was able to elude
X-ray machines and other security Saturday at Los Angeles
International Airport, considered one of the nation's most secure.
   ``He boarded Flight 30 in Los Angeles and that's where we should
have caught him,'' Ed Martelle, American Airlines spokesman said
Saturday from the company's headquarters in Dallas.
   ``We're very concerned about it because up to this point Los
Angeles has been our best security section,'' Martelle said. ``So,
as a starting point we have to look at if it was possible for him
to get by our screeners without them noticing.''
   Comas-Banos, 37, flew the first leg of his journey to Dallas,
then transferred to a Miami-bound flight that he allegedly tried to
hijack.
   ``After the flight left the ground on its way to Miami, he
produced a demand note and said he wanted to be taken to Havana,''
said FBI agent William Gavin.
   The Boeing 727 with 157 people aboard attempted to head toward
Cuba, but came back to Miami after the pilot told Comas-Banos the
jet was running out of fuel.
   Speaking Spanish, Comas-Banos told the flight crew he was
carrying a bomb in a duffel bag that actually contained the gun
used to start track races, two small knives and a pair of scissors.
   Ninety minutes after Flight 1098 parked in a remote corner of
Miami International Airport, Comas-Banos allowed children to leave
the jet and then collapsed in front of authorities.
   Comas-Banos was charged with air piracy and was jailed at the
federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami pending a
magistrate's hearing Tuesday. He faces a maximum penalty of life in
prison if convicted, Gavin said.
   Security at Los Angeles International was tightened in December
1987 after David Burke, a recently fired USAir employee, boarded a
Pacific Southwest Airlines jet and opened fire in the cabin and
cockpit.
   The jet bound for San Francisco from Los Angeles plummeted to
earth, killing all 43 people aboard.
   Among new measures taken since that tragedy, employees with
airline badges, including pilots, were ordered to pass through
metal detectors and have their luggage X-rayed like everyone else.
   Martelle said it wasn't immediately known how Comas bypassed
security.
   Although a starter's pistol would not be allowed in carry-on
luggage under any circumstances, pocket knives and scissors would
not automatically be considered weapons, he said.
   Comas-Banos had come to Los Angeles, where he lived on the
streets, after escaping from St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington,
D.C., where John Hinckley, who attempted to assassinate President
Reagan in 1981, is held. Comas-Banos was there from 1980 to 1982.
   Comas-Banos reportedly has a son in Cuba and had wanted to
return to his homeland.

<UNK>Turkish Prime Minister Says Soviet MiG Was ``Very Old''</UNK>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal,
asked today about rejecting a U.S. request to inspect a Soviet jet
fighter flown by a defector, said the aircraft was ``a very old
plane.''
   Pentagon officials in Washington had complained that Turkey
returned the MiG-29 without permitting U.S. inspection of the
plane, which they said carried advanced radar and had other
equipment the Soviets did not include in export models.
   According to U.S. officials, the rebuff caused ``a lot of
resentment '' at the Pentagon and the State Department because the
inspection would have shed light on the jet's capabilities.
   ``This was a Russian front-line MiG-29, not the export version
of this plane,'' explained one administration source in
Washington.``We've examined export versions, but the Soviets don't
share their top technology on the stuff they export. This was a
chance to really get a look at the engines, `look-down' radar and
other systems that are loaded only on the Soviet air force planes.''
   Ozal was asked about the incident while posing for pictures with
President Bush before a meeting today in the Belgian guest house
Bush is using on a two-day visit for the 16-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. Turkey is a NATO member.
   ``It's a very old plane, it's quite old,'' Ozal said when
questioned why the U.S. request was rejected. On Sunday, the White
House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the incident might come up
during the president's discussion with the Turkish leader.
   Sources in Washington said Turkey never offered an adequate
explanation for its refusal to allow American experts to study the
plane, but U.S. officials assume the Turks were trying to avoid
antagonizing the neighboring Soviets.
   In Ankara, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Inal Batu
reiterated Sunday what he had said at a news conference last
Wednesday. ``This is an affair completely between Turkey and the
Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Batu added that ``I have no knowledge of any U.S. request for
permission to inspect the Soviet plane.'' He did not elaborate.
   According to the administration sources, the U.S. government was
not informed of the defection _ even though the pilot has asked for
asylum in the United States _ ``until after the Turks had already
assured the Russians they could have their plane back.''
   Capt. Alexander Zuyev fled the Soviet Union on May 20, flying to
the Turkish town of Trabzon on the Black Sea with a bleeding arm
wound.
   Pravda, the newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party, later
reported that Zuyev was working as a duty dispatcher at the
Tskhakaya airfield north of Batumi and therefore was armed on the
day of his flight. It said he shot and wounded a sentry, who fired
back and wounded Zuyev.
   The MiG-29, which carries the NATO codename of Fulcrum, is
considered the most modern and capable jet fighter currently in the
Soviet inventory.
   The plane can fly at 2.3 times the speed of sound and according
to U.S. intelligence agencies, carries ``a true
look-down-shoot-down radar, enabling it to engage low-flying
aircraft or cruise missiles.''
   Turkey allowed Zuyev's plane to be flown back to the Soviet
Union on May 21. It was stripped of rockets and weapons, which were
returned on a separate plane.

<TEXT>
   The suppression of liberal forces in China has
further unnerved Hong Kong over its future under Chinese rule,
triggering massive demonstrations and uncharacteristic political
activism.
   In largest protest march in this British colony's history, what
police estimated to be estimated 500,000 people rallied Sunday in
support of China's pro-democracy protesters.
   Police said the crowd exceeded the estimated 400,000 who
demonstrated on May 21 protest Chinese Premier Li Peng's
declaration of martial law in Beijing. Organizers said 1.5 million
people attended Sunday's rally.
   Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, and its
residents have become increasingly nervous over the prospect of
Communist Chinese rule.
   A poll conducted by the conservative South China Morning Post
newspaper reported that one-third of the territory's 5.7 million
people hope to emigrate before the takeover.
   China has promised to preserve the territory's freewheeling
socioeconomic lifestyle for 50 years under a ``one country, two
systems'' concept that would allow capitalism to exist under
communism in a government run by Hong Kong people without Chinese
interference.
   Hong Kong residents have long been skeptical about the Chinese
promises, and Li's decision to slap martial law on Beijing has
deepened their anxiety.
   ``I believe that to call out the troops to handle a peaceful
demonstration by students does seem to be heavy-handed,'' said Dame
Lydia Dunn, senior member of the Executive Council, which functions
as a government Cabinet.
   Eric Hotung, a fourth-generation Hong Kong business magnate,
said Britain and China have repeatedly said Hong Kong's future
autonomy was assured in a Sino-British agreement signed in 1984.
   ``But (the people of Hong Kong) have also seen, and seen with
the greatest clarity, how indifferent the leaders in Beijing are
capable of being towards the legitimate aspirations of their own
people,'' said Hotung, whose grandfather, Sir Robert Hotung, was
among the first Chinese knighted by Britain.
   Community leaders and newspapers say a Basic Law document, under
which China will govern Hong Kong, should be strengthened to
safeguard the territory's autonomy.
   The document, drafted by a committee of Hong Kong and Chinese
delegates appointed by China, is to be presented to China's
congress for enactment next year.
   Demonstrations to support the pro-democracy movement in China
have been held daily for more than a week. Sunday's march lasted
eight hours, and the protesters included parents with babies,
students, elderly citizens and merchants.
   Chanting ``Long live democracy!'' and ``Support Beijing
students!'' the crowd began their march in a downtown business
district before ending their rally in a park.
   Banners of support were hung from a number of buildings,
including the pro-Beijing Ta Kung Pao newspaper.
   ``China and Hong Kong have the same fate,'' proclaimed one
banner. ``We need democracy for a better tomorrow.''
   Hong Kong's population is 98 percent Chinese. About two-thirds
are refugees from China or their descendants.
   In Taiwan, the Nationalists _ who claim to be the legitimate
rulers of all China _ have condemned the Chinese attempts to
suppress the pro-democracy movement, and President Lee Teng-hui has
instructed government officials to recommend ``effective measures''
that could be taken to help the students.
   But critics say this would take time, and newspapers, scholars
and citizens say the government should have moved faster.
   Chang Chun-hung, secretary general of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, said the Nationalists failed to respond
effectively because ``they neither have the capability nor the
desire to return to the mainland.''
   Wu Yen-huan, 79, a legislator from the governing Nationalist
Party, said that if President Chiang Kai-shek, who led the defeated
Nationalists to Taiwan in 1949, was still alive, he would have sent
troops across the Taiwan Strait to help students on the mainland
who are championing democracy. Chiang died in 1975.
   ``Times are different now,'' he lamented.

   The main Iranian opposition group today
claimed that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini suffered a heart attack
four days after undergoing surgery for intestinal bleeding.
   The claim could not be independently verified.
   The heart attack occurred Saturday in a Tehran hospital, the
Mujahedeen Khalq (People's Holy Warriors) said in a statement sent
to The Associated Press in Cyprus.
   Tehran television reported Sunday that Khomeini suffered
discomfort in his heart, which was treated and relieved, but gave
no details of the condition.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said Iran's spiritual
leader was in satisfactory condition and was spending more time
with relatives.
   Surgery was carried out Tuesday on Khomeini's duodenum and
Khomeini's personal physician said afterward the opration in a
Tehran hospital that the country's spiritual patriarch was in
excellent condition for his age.
   Khomeini, 86, has been reported ailing since he suffered a heart
attack in 1986 and has saince rarely been seen outside his suburban
Tehran home.
   Official reports had for years listed Khomeini's age at 89, but
his brother, Pasandideh, said after the operation that Khomeini was
86.

   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen
Monday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost ground.
   The dollar closed at 142.88 yen, up 2.48 yen from last Friday's
close of 140.40 yen, after trading in a range of 142.65-143.18 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
153.57 points for a record-high 34,191.62-point close Friday, shed
30.79 points, or 0.09 percent, to close at 34,160.83.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's strength followed its rally
in the Sydney market, which opened earlier than Tokyo.
   ``The dollar's bullishness is largely due to speculative
actions,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese commercial bank,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the Bank of Japan sold about $300 million Monday morning
in an attempt to break the rising dollar. Officials at the central
bank declined to comment.
   Dealers also said a report that West German monetary authorities
are unlikely to hike key interest rates contributed to the dollar's
bullishness.
   Securities dealers said the Nikkei index opened higher, but the
sharp gain of the dollar against the Japanese yen discouraged
further buying of shares.

<HEAD>Landing Gear Collapses After 2 Tires Blow As Jet Taxis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Part of the landing gear on a Continental jet
collapsed and the right wing hit the ground as the plane approached
the gate at Stapleton International Airport, officials said.
   Continental Flight 73, carrying 44 passengers and six crew from
Newark, N.J., landed at 8:08 p.m. Sunday evening and had turned
onto a taxiway when two tires blew and the right main landing gear
collapsed, said Stapleton spokesman Norm Avery.
   The right wing of the aircraft hit the pavement, Avery said.
   ``It felt like a car with a flat tire _ you know, blump, blump,
blump,'' said Vincent Calarco of Priceton, N.J., who was traveling
with his wife, Penza, and their three children.
   One woman was taken from the plane and briefly treated for
hyperventilation at the University of Colorado Health Sciences
Center, said spokeswoman Barbara Thrower.
   The cause of the accident was not known, said Ned Walker, a
spokesman for Continental at the carrier's Houston headquarters.
   Walker said the aircraft underwent a thorough check earlier this
month, ``and there were no indications whatsoever of any problems.''
   The plane, an MD-80 made by McDonnell Douglas Corp., can seat
about 145 people, Walker said.
   The left main landing gear collapsed on a Delta Air Lines 727
last week as it was being towed away from a gate at Stapleton.
Corrosion was blamed for the landing gear failure.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Dip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today, causing stock prices to dip, dealers said.
   The dollar ended trading at 142.88 yen, up 2.48 yen from
Friday's close of 140.40 yen. After opening sharply higher at
142.75 yen, the U.S. currency ranged between 142.65 and 143.18 yen
during the day.
   ``Market expectations that the West German central bank will not
raise its interest rates encouraged dollar-buying,'' said a dealer
at a Japanese commercial bank.
   Reports in European newspapers that the West German central bank
is unlikely to raise its interest rates boosted dollar-buying in
Sydney and then in Tokyo today.
   ``The dollar's bullishness is largely due to speculation,'' said
another dealer at a major Japanese commercial bank, who also spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Dealers said the Bank of Japan sold about $800 million today in
an attempt to break the rising dollar. Officials at the central
bank declined to comment.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 153.57 points Friday, shed 30.79
points or 0.09 percent, closing at 34,160.83.
   The index moved up in early trading, but the sharp gain of the
dollar against the Japanese yen discouraged further share buying,
traders said.
   ``The market is ready for a new rally, but unstable exchange
rates are ruining it,'' said Ichitaro Watanabe, a dealer at Nikko
Securities Co. ``We have to wait until the yen-dollar rates settle
down to launch any campaigns.''

<HEAD>Pipeline Lawyer Says `Little Town' Trying to Block Commerce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city is accusing the operators
of a pipeline that exploded of pushing to restore the flow of
gasoline without enough thought for the safety of local residents.
   Two people were killed and 15 homes were burned when the 14-inch
line blew up Thursday in the same area where a runaway freight
train jumped the tracks and demolished a row of houses May 12.
Speculation is the train damaged the line.
   The parent company of the locally based Calnev Pipe Line Co.
announced Sunday the damaged pipeline will be rebuilt under tougher
standards. The company had obtained a court order Saturday barring
the city from ordering that the line be rerouted.
   Charles P. Diamond, an attorney for Calnev, complained that San
Bernardino, a city of about 120,000, is ``a little town trying to
take on interstate commerce.''
   The city, in turn, accused Calnev of insensitivity.
   ``Their entire attitude ever since the disaster occurred on
Thursday has been one of callousness toward the people of San
Bernardino, and they've been very obvious that their one concern is
to get their petroleum products flowing again,'' City Attorney
James Penman said.
   Penman said the city had asked to have the line move west of the
railroad track, under a dry river bed, but company officials
refused because of the cost.
   While the city cannot get Calnev to change the route of the
line, Penman said U.S. District Judge David Williams rewrote a
proposed restraining order to remove language that would have
barred the city from interfering with reopening the line, an option
the city is considering.
   The pipeline carries gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from a tank
farm in nearby Colton, several miles from the blast site, to
southern Nevada, supplying the Las Vegas Valley with 90 percent of
its fuel.
   Gsoline is being trucked to the desert resort while the line is
repaired.
   ``We believe that the best possible way to repair this pipeline
is to not only replace ... but also to bury it 100 percent deeper
than required by regulation to a depth of six feet,'' said Robert
Claypoole, president of Chicago-based GATX Terminals Corp, which
owns Calnev.
   ``To make any major changes in the routing of the line
additionally would cause a six- to eight-week interruption of
service,'' he said.
   Claypoole said the pipe will be tested by forcing water through
it at pressure 125 percent greater than normal operating pressure.
The hydrostatic test wasn't performed when the pipe was declared
safe following the derailment.
   William Pugh of the National Transportation Safety Board said
federal investigators plan to examine an additional 800 to 1,000
feet of the pipeline and conduct metallurgical tests on train parts
embedded in the earth near the line.
   About 270 people remain displaced from 70 homes damaged in the
fire, according to police Cpl. John Waterhouse.

<HEAD>Soviet Union Evangelical Emigrating as Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evangelical Christians are getting exit visas from
the Soviet Union by pretending to be Jews wanting to go to Israel,
according to a report that says many end up settling in western
Massachusetts.
   Between 300 and 400 Soviet Pentecostals have settled in the
area, The Boston Globe reported today.
   The Slavic Pentecostal Church in West Springfield had seven
members 18 months ago. Today it is has 250, and three families are
living in the church basement.
   The Rev. Pawel Lubanski, pastor of the church, said he and his
wife try to find jobs, food, housing and transportation for the
immigrants, most of whom do not speak English when they arrive.
   It is virtually impossible for Soviet Christians to immigrate to
the United States, so Evangelicals pretend to be Jews wishing to go
to Israel, officials said.
   Soviet officials are said to look the other way because they
want to get rid of the Pentecostals while claiming only Jews seek
exit visas.
   ``Because of the way they get out, we never know when or how
many will show up,'' Lubanski said. Once a community has been
established in the United States, such as the one in West
Springfield, word spreads among those in the Soviet Union.
   ``It's an open secret that Christians are emigrating with Jewish
visas,'' said Serge Duss, Soviet refugee coordinator for World
Relief, an arm of the 15 million-member National Association of
Evangelicals.
   ``It's convenient to everyone. The real problems start once the
refugees, Jew and Christian alike, reach Vienna.''
   The case of each Soviet Union emigrant hoping to come to the
United States is evaluated individually before refugee status is
granted. Emigrants wait an average of 84 days in Vienna or Rome.
   Duss said 10,000 to 12,000 Jews and 2,200 Pentecostals are
awaiting processing in those cities. More than 5,000 Soviet Jews
and Christians are awaiting appeals after being denied refugee
status by the United States.
   The 47 Russian-speaking students in West Springfield public
schools have bilingual teachers for most subjects, said John
Rosenberg, assistant to the superintendent for curriculum and
programs.
   ``They've mixed right in and have been accepted 100 percent by
the other kids. They have formed very strong fireendships. They
learn English very quickly. In about a year, they are conversant,''
Rosenberg said.

<HEAD>No Response To O'Connor's Hostage Plea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BKIRKI, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York today
made yet another appeal to the captors of nine American hostages to
``permit me to come and see you,'' but hopes for a positive
response were rapidly dwindling.
   The Roman Catholic archbishop's visit was nearing its end.
   ``If your captors will permit me to come to see you wherever you
are, if it's physically possible for me, I will come,'' O'Connor
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   He recalled that during a previous visit to Lebanon three years
ago, he was given different locations about where the hostages were
being held.
   ``Somebody would say they were in the (Bekaa) valley, somebody
would say they're down south, they're in Syria, they're in Iran,''
O'Connor said.
   ``But I learned about one year later that at one particular
point they were only two blocks away from where I was and they did
see and they did hear me and it gave them some hope,'' the cardinal
said. He declined to elaborate.
   O'Connor was last in Lebanon in June 1986. A month later, the
Rev. Lawrence Jenco, an American Roman Catholic priest, was
released after 18 months of captivity.
   At present, at least 15 Western hostages are being held in
Lebanon, most of them by pro-Iranian extremist factions. The nine
Americans include the longest-held: Terry Anderson, Associated
Press chief Middle East correspondent, was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   O'Connor spoke at the hilltop Bkirki Monastery, where he has
been staying as the guest of Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual
head of Lebanon's dominant Maronite Catholic community.
   He declared outright support for Christian army commander Gen.
Michel Aoun's demand that the Syrian army withdraw from Lebanon.
   ``I think every person I've met has said that nothing can happen
until the forces of Syria leave Lebanon. So I'm not creating this.
This is what I hear wherever I go,'' O'Connor said.
   Aoun's 20,000 mainly Christian units have been locked in 11
weeks of fierce fighting with an alliance of Syrian and Druse
forces that has left 359 people killed and 1,396 wounded since
March 8.
   At a summit conference in Morocco last week, Arab heads of
states called on all warring factions in Lebanon to ``strictly
adhere'' to a cease-fire proclaimed by the Arab League on May 11.
   But Syrian artillery positions in Moslem west Beirut kept on
blasting the Christian coast north of Beirut, maintaining a
blockade against the 1 million Christians in the beleaguered
enclave.
   ``People in the United States do not know that when the
cease-fire came that the Syrians did not stop firing. So I think
this is very important that Gen. Aoun's position be made much
clearer to the people of the United States,'' O'Connor said.
   O'Connor said there was no personal friction between him and
U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy after the cardinal's controversial
decision Sunday to cancel a trip to west Beirut for talks with
Moslem leaders.
   ``There's no friction over west Beirut. The ambassador told me
that he had received a call from Washington, that they were afraid
to concentrate that many people in one place for security
reasons,'' the cardinal said.
   He avoided answering a question on why a reception planned for
him at the embassy by McCarthy was canceled Sunday afternoon.
   O'Connor's failure to cross Beirut's dividing Green Line had
angered Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a mostly Moslem
Cabinet contesting power with a Christian Cabinet under Aoun.
   Hoss charged that security conditions in west Beirut were
portrayed ``in an exaggerated manner'' to make O'Connor call off
the visit.
   O'Connor told reporters at Bkirki today that he had a 25-minute
talk by telephone with Hoss in a bid to dispel Moslem anger, but
did not say whether it was successful.
   Hoss later left for Damascus for talks with Syrian government
leaders on Arab efforts to end the Lebanese crisis. His departure
seemed to remove the last chance for O'Connor to come to west
Beirut.
   O'Connor, who arrived in Lebanon Saturday, was due to leave at
dawn Tuesday, sources at Bkirki said. They requested anonymity.
   The cardinal has won the hearts of Christians through his
anti-Syrian statements and pledge that ``bishops in the United
States will not turn their backs on you, not as long as I am
alive.''
   A group of 40 Christian university students said today that
``out of respect for O'Connor's visit'' they had called off a
39-day picket of the U.S. Embassy protesting what they called
America's negative policy in Lebanon.

   About 550 guests sang the praises of Armand

Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   The party at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Sunday night included
performances by the Los Angeles Philharmonic with cellist Mstislav

   Host Danny Thomas read congratulatory wires to Hammer from
President and Mrs. Bush, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, French
President Francois Mitterand and his wife Danielle, Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, King Constantine of Greece and the Duke
and Duchess of York.
   The birthday toast to Hammer was given by entertainer Helen
Hayes. Hammer had a crush on the actress 56 years ago, when ``I was
35 and you were much, much younger,'' he told the her and the crowd.
   ``My dreams _ to create a meaningful peace in a world free of
nuclear weapons and the defeat of cancer in my lifetime _ are
closer to reality than ever before, '' Hammer said.
   Hammer throughout many of the Cold War years was a leading
advocate of improved relations with the Soviets.

<HEAD>Student Activists Divided Over Continuing Occupation Of Square</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: To RESTORE dropped words, SUB 20th graf, `Unlike past ...

<TEXT>
   Student pro-democracy protesters split today on
whether to press on with their three-week occupation of central
Tiananmen Square, grappling over how to face the anticipated
conservative backlash.
   Hardliners who have seized the upper hand in the government have
moved relentlessly in recent days toward snuffing out the
6-week-old movement.
   Workers were reportedly being fined for taking part in
demonstrations _ few were seen in a march Sunday by about 80,000
people, mostly students _ and troops called under martial law were
said to have occupied Beijing's biggest steel plant.
   The state-run press, which only a week ago was filled with heady
reports of the democratic protests, was churning out propaganda
material.
   Leading moderates were reportedly in retreat.
   Sources said provincial officials have received documents
chronicling ``the serious errors'' of reformist Communist Party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, reportedly stripped of his post for
seeking reconciliation with the students.
   Others who similarly advocated political reform or supported
compromise with the students are expected to be punished or purged.
   ``We cannot leave the square!'' student loudspeakers blared
today. ``If the People's Liberation Army suppresses us, we will
become an exemplary model for all future movements to come.''
   The announcement, said by the loudspeaker to be from a
leadership group, added to the confusion of who was in control of
the movement and whether the students had veered toward a more
confrontational stand.
   Beijing student leaders had earlier proposed staging a massive
victory rally on Tuesday, then leaving. But students from outside
the capital, many of them recent arrivals, have resisted.
   The Beijing leaders have cited the unsanitary conditions on the
square, occupied by students since May 13, and the need to shift
the course of the 6-week-old movement.
   Students, they contend, should begin going out among the
populace to explain their goals. The protesters seek more
democracy, including a free press and an end to official corruption.
   Wang Dan, one of the Beijing leaders, said late Sunday that he
was determined to leave on Tuesday and expects the Beijing students
to go with him. About 10,000 students today occupied the grimy,
foul-smelling squatters' camp in the square, down from a peak of
200,000. About half are from outside Beijing and many traveled for
days on crowded trains to take part.
   It is the non-Beijing groups that are adamantly opposed to
giving up the square.
   ``We will not leave,'' said Yao Gangfu, a student from coastal
Jiangsu province. ``We haven't achieved our goals.''
   The loudspeaker announcement called on students to stay until
June 20, when the National People's Congress, China's legislature,
is scheduled to hold a special session to discuss the pro-democracy
protests.
   On Sunday, students from most of China's 31 provinces paraded
through the capital's streets, repeating their pro-democracy
slogans and demanding the resignation of Premier Li Peng, who
imposed martial law in Beijing on May 20 and ordered troops into
the capital region.
   Another 30,000 students marched against Li in Shanghai, with one
banner depicting the premier as a cockroach with a military cap.
   In Hong Kong, police said 500,000 people marched to show support
for the students. Thousands of Chinese also rallied in Taiwan,
Australia, Chicago and New York in solidarity.
   Unlike past demonstrations in which up to 1 million Chinese took
to the streets, there were few non-students in the Beijing march on
Sunday, an indication that the government hard-line stance against
the protests has begun to have effect.
   Workers reportedly are being fined or face pay deductions for
participating in marches, and people in academic institutes and
news organizations are being ordered to write ``reports'' on their
activities during the demonstrations.
   Such ``reports'' could presumably be used against them.
   The state-run media, its journalists now in jeopardy for their
active participation in the street marches, have returned to being
propaganda organs for the government.
   The official Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, gave
passing mention to Sunday's demonstration.
   But today's front page was filled with articles of courts
supporting the government decision on martial law, citizens writing
letters calling on students to leave Tiananmen Square and
government leaders expressing thanks for popular support for the
military.
   Several workers from the Capital Steel Works said troops have
occupied several parts of the mill, which employs 220,000 people.
   They said workers were being prohibited from returning home for
fear they would take part in the marches.
   Diplomatic and government sources said Sunday that the
government has set up a new censorship group to stop publication of
any articles harmful to the conservative faction that has gained
control in China's power struggle.
   One liberal Shanghai weekly, the World Economic Herald, has not
published in recent weeks after defying orders not to print stories
critical of the government.

   The dollar was higher in Europe late this morning.
Foreign currency dealers said trading was light because of the
Memorial Day holiday in the United States and the British bank
holiday.
   Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said they were surprised by the dollar's rebound
following a round of coordinated central bank intervention on
Friday which, for the first time in weeks, included the Deutsche
Bundesbank.
   ``An upward correction was in the offing, but this is a bit
strong,'' said one dealer at a European bank in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 2.48 yen to a closing 142.88 yen. Later, in
Europe, it was quoted at 142.53 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe at midmorning compared with late
Friday in London:
   _2.0090 West German marks, up from 1.9675
   _1.7345 Swiss francs, up from 1.7155
   _6.8030 French francs, up from 6.6625
   _2.2663 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2150
   _1,451.00 Italian lire, up from 1,421.75
   _1.2035 Canadian dollars, unchanged
   In Europe, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.57 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5922 dollars late Friday
in London.
   Bullion markets were closed in London for the bank holiday, but
in Zurich the bid price for gold was $363.20 a troy ounce, down
from $364.50 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 97 cents to close at a bid
$363.16.

<HEAD>Investigation May Lead To Closure of Home Studios</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recording industry group is campaigning to
restrict the use of home studios for musical production, a
development that some producers and musicians like Frank Zappa find
ominous.
   Efforts to shut down music producer Chas Sanford's home studio _
where the likes of Chicago, Rod Stewart and Stevie Nicks have
recorded _ could affect thousands of Hollywood creative people who
work out of their homes.
   The crackdown is in response to complaints about violations of
city zoning ordinances that prohibit commercial use of residential
property.
   ``If you look at the way they're applying this zoning concept,
that no one can do anything commercial in their house, you'd shut
Hollywood down,'' said Zappa, who has recorded his indiosyncratic
material for years at a studio in his Laurel Canyon home.
   ``Strictly speaking, other than a situation where they
(home-based workers) are immediately adjoining a commercial zone,
it's not a permitted use,'' said Frank Eberhard, the city's chief
zoning administrator. ``But unless there's a complaint, there's not
a real heavy enforcement of those rulings.''
   Sanford alleged that a fledgling trade group, the Hollywood
Association of Recording Professionals, is responsible for the
investigation into his studio, not his neighbors.
   ``They think everyone should be forced to go to their studios to
work. I don't think I should be told where I have to go and be
creative,'' Sanford said. ``It's a misuse of the law when a rival
studio 20 miles from my house _ not my next door neighbor _ can go
to the zoning commission and evoke the law to put someone out of
business.''
   Sanford contended that if artists are prohibited from working
out of their homes it could have a negative impact on the recording
industry.
   ``If these guys force everyone not to be able to work out of
their homes, there would only be $500,000 recording budgets,'' he
said. ``None of the new bands would be able to legally do stuff out
of their houses, which is where they all start.''
   But Buddy Brundo, owner of Conway Recording Studios, said the
commercial studios only want to target people who rent out home
studios, not musicians who work in their own homes.
   ``We're not talking about artist studios. We're talking about
people who build studios in their houses for hire,'' Brundo said.
``This guy (Sanford) built a studio for hire, period.''
   Sanford denied he runs a studio-for-hire business. He said that
in the 2{ years since he moved into the house he has rented it out
for a total of four sessions lasting 15 days, and those artists
were his friends.
   Many top recording artists have built studios in their homes.
Tom Petty recorded his ``Southern Accents'' album in the basement
studio of his Encino home, Van Halen recorded two albums at the
home studio of guitarist Eddie Van Halen and Dave Stewart of the
Eurythmics has done extensive recording at his home.
   Studio owners complained that state-of-the-art studio's such as
Sanford's give them an unfair advantage of not having to comply
with zoning regulations.
   ``We're playing by the rules and they're not,'' said Allen
Sides, owner of Ocean Way recording, which operates studios in
Hollywood and Sherman Oaks. ``If they want to compete on the same
basis, I don't think any of us have any complaints.
   ``But if they're going to operate and not pay 1.5 percent of
their gross in business tax, not pay proper state Board of
Equalization taxes, not pay proper overtime for their employees and
have health insurance plans and have handicapped bathrooms and all
the things that we have to do, it's a different story.''

<HEAD>Alfonsin Announces Emergency Economic Measures; Food Looting Continues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Raul Alfonsin has
announced an emergency package aimed at easing an economic crisis
that has led to the looting of supermarket and grocery stores in
major cities.
   Alfonsin, in a nationally televised speech, promised Sunday
night that his lame-duck government will make sure consumer
products get to the people in what he called an ``extremely
dangerous and cruelly damaging'' economic crisis.
   As he spoke, officials in Rosario, the country's third largest
city, reported about 20 new cases of looting Sunday night that
involved groups of from 20 to 40 people.
   The official news agency Telam said about 20 people had been
arrested and that streets were being patrolled by police and
firefighters. Rosario is 150 miles north of Buenos Aires.
   The incidents were similar to dozens of others that began
Tuesday in Cordoba, the second largest city, and quickly spread to
other cities, including working-class suburbs of the capital.
   Some looters have eaten food in the stores.
   In his speech, Alfonsin called on Argentines to ``roll up your
sleeves and go to work'' to ensure that emergency steps work.
   ``The government will dictate clear and tough rules to put an
end to the risk of hyperinflation, will surgically put state
finances in order and will severely punish speculative maneuvers,''
Alfonsin said.
   He also offered to ``modify some of our criteria'' to fit plans
of the President-elect Carlos Menem and the Peronist Party, who
defeated the governing Radical Civic Union in May 14 elections.
   Alfonsin's measures, some of which require congressional
approval, include a return to monetary exchange controls with an
official exchange rate for the austral, Argentina's currency, which
has lost 90 percent of its value over the last four months.
   Alfonsin did not say what the official value of the austral
would be. The Central Bank announced Sunday that an exchange
holiday, ordered on May 22, would remain in effect today.
   The austral had been allowed to float since early February, when
17 bought a dollar. The currency closed at 170 to the dollar on the
last day exchange markets were open.
   Exchange operations will be closely watched and violations of
controls will be considered crimes, Alfonsin said.
   The exchange markets and the banking system will be
``progressively regularized'' Alfonsin said. Banks, which fear a
run on deposits, were closed May 22 and 23 and were allowed to open
May 24 with withdrawals limited to 20,000 australs (about $100)
every two days.
   Consumer price policies will remain unchanged, Alfonsin said.
Although the government has not set price ceilings for consumer
goods, prices may not be increased without specific official
approval.
   Retailers have ignored the regulations, marking up prices almost
daily and the cost of living increase for May is expected to top 60
percent.
   ``Excesses will not be tolerated, especially those that have
been observed in recent days,'' Alfonsin said.
   He also warned that pricing of goods in any currency other than
the austral will be punishable by law. Numerous retailers recently
have begun pricing goods in dollars.
   Government spending also will be cut, and a scheduled
presidential trip to France will be canceled, Alfonsin said.
   The emergency plan ``must become everyone's program or it is
condemned to failure,'' he said. ``I ask each and every Argentine
to occupy his battle station.''

<HEAD>U.S. Team Flies to Laos To Dig Warplane Crash Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. military team seeking the
remains of missing American soldiers flew to Laos today after a
tropical storm delayed its mission for three days, a U.S. spokesman
said.
   The 15-man team flew from Bangkok to Savannakhet province, where
they will cooperate with Laotian workers in excavating the wreckage
of a U.S. warplane downed during the Indochina war.
   The project is to take about two weeks, said Ross Petzing, the
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok.
   The team comprises experts of the Joint Casualty Resolution
Center and the Army Central Identification Laboratory, both based
in Hawaii and entrusted with resolving the fates of America's
wartime missing.
   Petzing said the crash site was discovered during a survey in
December. Savannakhet is in southern Laos and borders northeastern
Thailand.
   The team originally flew there Friday, but returned to Bangkok
after less than three hours because of storm Cecil.
   The storm last week killed at least 78 people in Vietnam and
dumped heavy rains in Laos and Thailand before crossing into Burma.
In Burma it weakened into a low pressure cell, Thailand's
Meteorological Department said.
   The excavation is to be the sixth such joint project between the
United States and Laos since the war ended in 1975 with communist
victories in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Previous searches have
recovered remains later identified by the Army laboratory.
   The United States lists a total of 2,360 servicemen missing in
action from the war.

<HEAD>Candlelight Marches Commemorate AIDS Victims</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A hemophiliac priest with AIDS spoke at a service in rural
Kentucky and thousands marched in San Francisco as communities
throughout the nation took part in a worldwide project to remember
AIDS victims.
   Candlelight marches, rallies and religious ceremonies were
planned in 180 cities worldwide through today, including 97 cities
in the United States.
   The International AIDS Candlelight Memorials involves hundreds
of community-based AIDS organizations, and will be the largest
``AIDS action'' ever undertaken, according to Drew Siegel, a
spokesman for Mobilization Against AIDS in San Francisco.
   Activities surrounding the memorials vary widely across the
world, including an interfaith service at St. Martin-in-the-Fields
in London; a ceremony in a Buddhist temple in Bangkok; and a rally
in Newark, N.J., to remember children who have died of AIDS.
   In San Francisco, about 20,000 people turned out Sunday night
for the AIDS Candlelight Memorial gathering. Participants held
candles aloft as they walked quietly from the city's predominantly
homosexual Castro District to City Hall.
   ``It's a way of remembering our friends,'' said Jim Wyatt, 38.
``I've lost about 60.''
   In western Kentucky, a Roman Catholic priest with hemophilia
infected with AIDS, told about 15 people at a candlelight service
in Owensboro that they must not forget those who died of the
disease.
   The Rev. Danny Gough led the 45-minute nondenominational
Christian service, accompanied by organ music, while the audience
held lighted candles, according to Bob Johnson, an activist who
attended the service.
   Johnson said the service showed that tiny farming communities
are no longer shutting their eyes to AIDS.
   ``I was very impressed. In a common, rural community like
Owensboro, people have taken a long time to see that AIDS is a
problem everywhere,'' Johnson said. ``This is a community that
felt, `As long as we don't talk about it, it's not happening.' My
feeling was relief that as many turned out as did.''
   In Los Angeles, more than 2,500 people, each carrying a lighted
candle, somberly marched Sunday to remember the victims of AIDS and
to demonstrate for better and faster treatment of the disease.
   Elsewhere, several hundred people held lighted candles aloft and
formed a chain of flames around a park Sunday in a ceremony in
Kansas City. In Dallas, about 200 people gathered to light candles
and remember friends and loved ones who have died of AIDS.
   In Oakland, a weekend AIDS benefit concert and dance party drew
tens of thousands of people and reportedly raised about $500,000.
   In the biggest show of a weeklong series of musical
fund-raisers, Tracy Chapman, John Fogerty and the Grateful Dead
entertained some 30,000 people at the Oakland Coliseum on Saturday.
   Promoter Bill Graham said his ``best guess'' was that the
coliseum benefit would raise $500,000 for some 35 medical and
relief organizations in the San Francisco Bay area. But he was
disappointed in the turnout.
   ``There are many people in the community who didn't come today
out of fear,'' he said. ``The reason it's one-third empty ... is
that many people still have not been properly informed.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious,
fatal disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. In the United
States as of May 12, there have been 94,280 cases of AIDS reported
since June of 1981, of which 54,402 have been fatal, according to
the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

<DATELINE>CLARKS HILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A little bill from a South Carolina
congressman was all it took to rename the artificial lake that
straddles the Georgia border to Lake Thurmond.
   But it won't be that easy, say locals _ many of them Georgians _
who have raised 80,000 signatures to change the name of the
70,000-acre body of water back to Clarks Hill Lake.
   ``I don't care how long it takes, we'll get the name restored,''
said Roy Giles, leader of the group that calls itself ``Keep our
Lake Clarks Hill.'' With the Georgia Legislature stepping in this
spring to support the name restoration, ``it's become the war
between the states,'' he said.
   ``It's Still Clarks Hill to Me'' say T-shirts and caps for sale
at stores in both states.
   Clarks Hill Lake itself is a relatively new phenomenon, the
result of a 1946 Army Corps of Engineers dam on the Savannah River.
But residents on both sides of the lake had no problem with the
name until Dec. 3, 1987.
   On that date, Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., introduced a bill in
Congress changing the name from Clarks Hill to Thurmond Lake, in
honor of U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who turned 85 years old
two days later.
   The Senate approved the measure the next day, and then-President
Reagan signed it into law a few weeks later.
   No public hearings were held, much to the dismay of local
residents.
   Some of them cited a deep emotional attachment to the old name,
and others said they had built a business reputation on it,
bringing national fishing tournaments and speedboat races and
investing in souvenirs.
   In March 1988, some Lake Clarks Hill presented Thurmond in
Washington with 42,000 signatures from people in both states asking
that he recommend a compromise _ that the name of the lake be
restored to Clarks Hill, while the dam and road retain his name.
   Thurmond responded that he liked it just fine having a lake in
his name.
   The group kept up its campaign, buying radio, television and
newspaper ads and collecting more than 80,000 signatures.
   When the signatures reached 72,000, Georgia state Rep. Bill
Jackson said, ``Probably my driveway is the only thing named after
me, but if 72,000 people asked me to change it, I would.''
   Thurmond did ask that the words ``at Clarks Hill'' be added to
the new sign on the dam, so it now reads: ``J. Strom Thurmond Dam &amp;
Lake at Clarks Hill.'' That change was made not in an effort to
quiet complaints, but to help clear up any confusion that might
exist for people who knew the lake by its old name, said Thurmond
spokesman Christopher Simpson.
   Giles said he would like to see the sign read ``J. Strom
Thurmond Dam at Clarks Hill Lake.'' ``All they have to do is take
off the ampersand and move the word `lake' down,'' he said. ``It
wouldn't cost any money. I'll come out here and help them do it.''
   Giles noted that historians worked 10 years before getting the
name of Cape Canaveral, Fla., restored after it was changed to Cape
Kennnedy.
   In the meantime, all the signs in Georgia still say Clarks Hill,
as do some of the signs in South Carolina. The South Carolina signs
will be changed to Thurmond as they wear out.
   At the South Carolina welcome center on Interstate 20, a
receptionist said she didn't have any brochures on Thurmond Lake,
but she did have some on Clarks Hill.

<HEAD>Test Puts Cruise Missile Over Florida, Alabama, Back To Eglin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Navy Tomahawk cruise missile
launched from the Gulf of Mexico successfully completed a 450-mile
test flight over Florida and Alabama, a Department of Defense
spokesman said.
   The land-attack missile was launched at about 9:15 a.m. EDT
Sunday from a submarine under way in the Gulf and was recovered
after making a parachute landing in Eglin's test range, said Bob
Holsapple of the Cruise Missile Project.
   ``Tomahawks are known as the most-accurate (missiles) in the
world today and with a conventional, land-attack (configuration)
you can launch one from off the coast of Washington, D.C., and put
it inside Atlanta stadium through either goal post,'' Holsapple
said by phone from Fort Walton Beach.
   Cruise missiles can be launched from sea or air and can carry
nuclear or conventional warheads. The missile used in Sunday's test
was unarmed, said Holsapple.
   Because the jet-powered weapon was recovered by parachute,
rather than crash landing into its target as a live weapon would,
it can be refurbished, probably at a cost of $100,000 to $300,000.
A new missile would cost about $1.3 million, he said.
   Cruise missiles can fly up to 1,500 miles, depending on the
warhead.

<HEAD>New Documents Shed New Light on Jewish American History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of more than 1,000 documents
and books that shed new light on early Jewish communities in the
United States might call for a revision of the history of American
Jews.
   The new documents show that Jews were not concentrated in the
larger cities of the Northeast. They settled extensively in the
Deep South much earlier than originally thought and apparently
viewed the United States as a permanent home, not just a refuge,
historians say.
   Among the other findings are evidence that Jews formed
close-knit settlements throughout the country, including the Deep
South, as early as the 1820s.
   ``History is only human, not divine,'' said Nathan M. Kaganoff,
a Jewish scholar who helped uncover the material. ``We now have a
lot of facts that will lead a lot to be rewritten.''
   The discoveries come from a private collection of dusty
prayerbooks, playbills, rabbinic writings and cookbooks held for
decades in a Wall Street safe until purchased for the American
Jewish Historical Society.
   Kaganoff learned of the collection earlier this year when he was
told the items would be auctioned, and brought the collection to
the attention of Society benefactors.
   Benefactors Eleanor and Morris Soble paid an estimated $500,000
for the collection, which they bought from art and antiques dealer
Bruce Gimelson and donated to the Society about a month ago.
   Kaganoff said the documents show the early Jewish-American
experience to be a positive one. He said the booklets published by
the many organizations and clubs formed by Jews in small towns
reveal that they embraced their new country.
   ``It looks as if they felt so much at home that they wanted to
establish their own communities,'' Kaganoff said. ``They didn't
want to return from where they came. We thought they were just
looking for a haven in big cities. Now we see they went to little
towns and created institutions that meant they wanted to stay.''
   In British Colonial America, the principal Jewish communities
were all in seaports: New York, Philadelphia, Savannah, Ga.,
Charleston, S.C., and Newport, R.I. In contemporary America, the
most numerous Jewish concentrations are still mostly in seaports,
with the top five in population being New York, Los Angeles,
Philadelphia, Chicago and Miami.
   The material is being catalogued for display at the Society, a
national organization headquartered on the campus of Brandeis
University and home to the world's largest collection of original
documents relating to the history of Jews in America.
   According to Kaganoff, much has always been known about the more
recent and greatest influx of Jews into the United States _ the 2.5
million Eastern European Jews who came here between 1881 and 1914.
   But the new collection provides a key to the earliest
Jewish-American history, dating from the time the first 23 Jews
arrived in the United States by boat from Amsterdam in 1654 and
extending to 1850, when the number of Jews had grown to 50,000.
   Among the most important findings in the collection:
Philadelphia, not New York, was probably the first American city to
develop a major Jewish community. Though the topic has been debated
by scholars for generations, evidence from the collection points to
Philadelphia, Kaganoff said.
   One such piece of evidence is a rabbinic prayer book, ``Ethics
of the Fathers,'' published in 1858 in Philadelphia. Until now, a
rabbinic prayer book published in 1860 in New York was believed to
be the oldest in the United States.
   ``New York was more like a marketplace,'' said Kaganoff. ``There
were a lot of people but not as much of an organized community.
Philadelphia emerged as an organized community and a cultural place
earlier.''

   The bodies of two Mormon missionaries
gunned down by suspected terrorists in Bolivia last week have been
returned to Utah for burial.
   Cardboard-covered coffins containing the bodies of Todd Ray
Wilson, 20, and Jeffrey Brent Ball, 20, were lowered from a Delta
jetliner at Salt Lake International Airport Sunday as members of
the Ball family and Mormon Church officials looked on.
   The caskets were transported by hearse to two funeral homes. The
slain missionaries will be buried Tuesday.
   M. Russell Ballard, a member of the church's Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles, comforted Ball's mother, Lois, as other family
members locked arms.
   Ballard later expressed the church's ``deepest feelings of
trauma and sadness'' over the killings and vowed that the faith's
missionary program would continue in South America and around the
world.
   The church has 37,500 missionaries overseas.
   ``We express our deepest love and concern and sympathy to the
families of the victims,'' Ballard said.
   Wilson and Ball were shot down last Wednesday as they returned
to their apartment in La Paz. One of the missionaries died
immediately, the other en route to a hospital.
   A statement distributed to La Paz newspapers claimed
responsibility for the attack on behalf of the Zarate Willka Armed
Liberation Front, a group named for a 19th century Indian
revolutionary in Bolivia.
   Ballard said church officials understood that the FBI was
working with Bolivian authorities to find out ``who did this and
why ... and why two Mormon missionaries would be the target.''
   Until more answers are forthcoming, church officials have
confined nearly 400 missionaries in Bolivia to their apartments and
have advised mission presidents around the world to be ``careful
and wise.''

<HEAD>Nakasone Resigns From His Party, But Not Parliament</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with four aides charged. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone resigned
today from the governing Liberal Democratic Party to take
responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal that brought down
his successor.
   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno is now expected to replace Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita who will resign soon because of the
Recruit Co. scandal.
   Also today, prosecutors charged four aides to senior politicians
with illegal handling of money in the Recruit scandal. The
prosecutors said their charges marked the end of the investigation
into political donations and stock dealings of the information
services conglomerate at the heart of the scandal.
   Nakasone, who headed the Liberal Democratic faction to which Uno
belongs, resigned from the party but refused opposition demands to
step down from his seat in Parliament because of the scandal.
   ``I made the decision (to leave the party) the day before
yesterday, which was my birthday,'' Nakasone told reporters today.
   The decision came after Nakasone acknowledged before Parliament
on Thursday that he had accepted $322,000 in political donations
from the Recruit Co.
   But he denied any wrongdoing in the scandal, which occurred
mainly during his 1982-87 term as prime minister.
   Nakasone met Takeshita today and conveyed his decision to resign
from the party to take responsibility for his link to the Recruit
scandal.
   Those charged today were Tsuneo Hattori, an aide to former
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa; Fumio Shimizu, a aide to Liberal
Democratic Secretary General Shintaro Abe; and Kikuo Katayama and
Masayoshi Sakamaki, aides to former Agriculture Minister Mutsuki
Kato.
   The four allegedly violated the Political Fund Restrictions Law
by failing to report Recruit donations in excess of $10,500. Each
of the four could face a fine up to $1,400.
   Prosecutors have charged 17 people, including two politicians
and four political aides, with bribery and violations of laws on
securities and political funds.
   The charges marked the end of the inquiry into the Recruit
scandal, said Yusuke Yoshinaga, head of the Tokyo District Public
Prosecutors' Office.
   ``This will cap our probe, which stretched some 260 days long,''
Yoshinaga said. In the Recruit scandal, top politicians escaped
without charges, though many careers were ruined and a close aide
to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita committed suicide the day after
Takeshita decided to resign.
   Takeshita today met with party elders to push Uno as his
successor. He told reporters Saturday that he hopes to appoint a
new prime minister by Friday and hinted that he and his Cabinet
will resign on Thursday.
   Uno, 66, a veteran legislator who was first elected to the House
of Representatives in 1960, has been Minister of International
Trade and Industry and director-general of the Defense Agency.
   He is particularly favored by party leaders because he is
believed untainted by the Recruit scandal and has experience in
foreign affairs.
   Some party members point out that Uno lacks experience in
dealing with party affairs, which is viewed as indispensable to
carry out painstaking reforms needed to salvage the party's
plunging popularity.
   However, Uno's main liability has been membership in the
Nakasone faction.
   For more than a month, the governing party has beem unable to
find a candidate to replace Takeshita because most senior leaders
have been implicated in the scandal.
   The Recruit Co. is accused of trying to influence government
policy by doling out millions of dollars in political donations and
selling underpriced, unlisted stock shares to business and
political leaders in 1986.
   The stock quickly rose in price when placed on the market, and
those who received the unlisted shares reaped tens of thousands of
dollars in profits.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II has accepted an invitation
by Fidel Castro to visit Cuba, a Vatican official said today. The
visit would be the first by a pope to the island nation.
   A date for the trip has not been set, and a Cuban diplomat said
it apparently would not occur before 1991.
   Castro's invitation was extended to the pope on Friday during a
private audience he held with Jose Felipe Carneado, chief of the
Cuban government office for religious affairs, according to Joaquin
Navarro, Vatican spokesman.
   Cuba has officially been atheist since the communist revolution
30 years ago that brought Castro to power.
   ``The date of the visit is yet to be established,'' Navarro
said. ``It's clear that it's not in the program yet,'' he said when
asked about reports that the pope would go to Havana in 1991.
   Cuba's Roman Catholic bishops recently invited the pope, who has
praised improvements in the church's ability to carry out its
mission in Cuba.
   Havana and the Holy See have diplomatic relations.
   A top Vatican official, Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, visited Cuba
in December and said later that the Church has enjoyed much more
freedom in recent years.
   Fernando Faure, first secretary at the Cuban embassy to the Holy
See, said Archbishop Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino of Havana brought
a message from Castro to the pope when he visited the Vatican in
April.
   Faure said that Ortega has commented that a papal visit to Cuba
would not take place before 1991.

by the West. Bush said his plan would seek to ``lock in Eastern
acceptance'' of the Western limits of 20,000 tanks, 28,000 armored
troop carriers and 16,500 to 24,000 artillery pieces, the precise
number depending on how those weapons are defined.
   Once the weapons are cut, they would be destroyed. The White
House said that would ``oblige the East to destroy tens of
thousands of weapons systems,'' in order to eliminate its wide
margin in those arms.
   According to NATO, the West has 16,424 main battle tanks and the
Warsaw Pact has 51,500 heavy tanks, with announced cuts to reduce
that number to 39,500.
   2. Reductions by each side in land-based combat airplanes and
helicopters to levels 15 percent below the current NATO level.
Those limits would apply from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains.
Including those weapons would expand the conventional arms talks,
something the Soviet Union has sought.
   According to NATO, the Western alliance now has about 2,400
combat helicopters in active units, while the Warsaw Pact nations
have 3,700. There are nearly 4,000 combat aircraft in NATO and
about 8,250 in the Eastern bloc alliance, which has announced plans
to cut that number to 7,320.
   Under the Bush plan, the affected aircraft would be destroyed.
   3. The United States would make a 20 percent cut in its combat
manpower in Europe, to about 275,000, and that would become the
ceiling for Soviet forces stationed in other eastern European
nations. That manpower ceiling would require the Soviets to reduce
their forces in Eastern Europe by about 325,000. The withdrawn
troops would be demobilized.
   4. Both sides would accelerate the timetable for reaching an
agreement on conventional forces in Europe and for implementing the
resultant cuts. Bush said there should be agreement within six
months to a year, with the reductions to be effective by 1992 or
1993. The Soviet Union has set a 1997 target date for agreement..

<HEAD>Major Shake-Up of South Korean Government Expected</HEAD>

   President Roh Tae-woo will shuffle his
Cabinet to quell public anger over government mishandling of labor
unrest and friction with communist North Korea, officials said
today.
   The prime minister, the head of the nation's main intelligence
agency and the home, labor and construction ministers were among
those who may be replaced, the officials said. All major Seoul
newspapers carried reports of the expected shake-up.
   The reports surfaced as a hunger strike by 300 radical students
entered a fourth full day today. The protesters are calling for
Roh's resignation.
   Many of the hunger strikers at the Roman Catholic Myongdong
Cathedral appeared weak and exhausted. Riot police ringed the
cathedral but made no move to intervene.
   In the southern provincial capital of Kwangju, violent protests
broke out today when riot police blocked a march by 5,000 radical
students calling for Roh to step down, the South Korean news agency
Yonhap reported. No details were immediately available.
   The radical students lack public support because of their
extremist views.
   Government officials said they expected a major Cabinet shuffle
in the next weeks to give Roh's administration a new look. Senior
ministers and Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon were to take the blame
for recent violent unrest, the officials said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Cabinet members to be replaced have not been decided, but it
is highly possible that the shuffle will affect many posts,'' one
official said.
   Roh, who won presidential elections in 1987, is unhappy that
ministers have failed to win public confidence, officials said. The
president believes the administration appears ineffective and needs
a new, stronger image, they said.
   In South Korea, periodic Cabinet shuffles spare the president
from taking responsibility for government failures. But Cabinet
ministers have little authority, and the presidency exacts full
control over the government.
   Park Seh-jik, head of the main intelligence agency, is being
blamed for the security forces' failure to stop dissident leader
Moon Ik-hwan visiting the communist North in March. Moon's visit
led to a confrontation between the Seoul government and dissidents
who seek unification of Korea. He was arrested on his return and
will be tried as a North Korean agent.
   Home Minister Lee Han-dong may be blamed for the threatened
resignation in April of thousands of police officers after an
opposition lawmaker slapped a top police commander, the officials
said.
   Labor Minister Chang Yung-chul and Social Affairs Minister Moon
Tai-joon are expected to take the blame for recent violent labor
strikes for higher pay, the officials said. Construction Minister
Park Seung may be removed because of widespread land speculation
caused by plans to build new cities, they said.

   Prosecutors today indicted a
42-year-old man on charges that he shot and killed Prime Minister
Olof Palme on a dark street in 1986 as the popular leader left a
movie with his wife.
   The 3,000-page indictment against Carl Gustav Christer
Pettersson also charged him with attempting to murder Palme's
widow, Lisbet, who was slightly wounded.
   ``I am convinced that this is enough to win a conviction,'' said
Stockholm Presecutor Jorgen Almbland. ``This is a step toward a
sentence.''
   Palme, a dynamic four-term prime minister, was gunned down Feb.
28, 1986, by a man who fled down a darkened lane and disappeared.
   The indictment ended a bumbling three-year investigation during
which investigators were branded incompetent by several official
inquiries. Three police chiefs and a justice minister resigned in
connection with the case.
   Pettersson, who has a previous manslaughter conviction on a
record sheet of more than 60 crimes, was routinely questioned
during the initial weeks of the investigation, but he was let go.
   The early stages of the investigation focused on the theory that
Palme was the victim of an international conspiracy. Stockholm
police chief Hans Holmer was fired after a 12-month effort as head
of the investigation when he refused to give up his discredited
theory that Kurdish terrorists assassinated Palme.
   Late last year, the investigation shifted after an anonymous tip
about discrepancies in Pettersson's alibi. He was arrested in
December.
   Pettersson has denied killing Palme. The trial was set to open
June 5.
   No motive was given. ``It's not up to us to prove that he had a
motive or what the motive was,'' said Anders Helin, the prosecutor
in charge of the case.
   The indictment listed 33 prosecution witnesses who claimed to
have seen Pettersson near the Grand Cinema or watched him follow
the Palmes after they left the movies and were walking home.
   A summary of the prosecution's case said Pettersson ``willfully
killed Prime Minister Olof Palme by shooting him in the back...''
   ``Pettersson, at the same time, attempted to kill Lisbet Palme
by firing again toward her,'' it said. ``Alternatively, he
endangered her life through gross negligence by firing the gun.''
   Mrs. Palme was listed as a witness, but the indictment gave no
indication of whether she would testify that she saw Pettersson
fire the gun.
   The evidence was largely circumstantial, and prosecutors
acknowledged they lacked the murder weapon and other forensic
evidence linking Pettersson to the shooting.
   ``It's a very strong case, but of course it would have been
better if we would have technical evidence,'' said Helin.
   Helin arrived at the courtroom carrying the indictment and the
evidence in a carton, which he presented to the court clerk.
   The prosecution is expected to present four witnesses who said
they saw Pettersson outside the theater at the time the movie began
and when it finished two hours later.
   Another two witnesses are expected to testify they saw
Pettersson follow the Palmes after the film. Eleven will testify
about Pettersson's possible motives, his opportunity to obtain a
weapon and his lack of a solid alibi.

<HEAD>Soldier Apologizes For Using Pages of Koran as Toilet Paper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli soldier apologized today for using
pages from the Koran, the Islamic holy book, as toilet paper while
troops occupied a school during a curfew in the West Bank, an army
spokesman said.
   In the occupied lands, three Palestinians were wounded, one
seriously, in clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing youths,
according to Arab reports.
   In Israel, armed force's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,
said that persistent attacks on Palestinians by Jewish settlers in
the territories is contributing to an escalation of violence in the
area.
   The desecration of the Koran in Deir Balout village was reported
by three newspapers and Israel radio after it was discovered over
the weekend by high school headmaster, Khalil Abdel Jawad. Eleven
pages of the Koran littered the bathroom floor and schoolyard, the
Haaretz and Jerusalem Post dailies said.
   Another entire volume of the Koran was found in a bathroom
cubicle, while drawings of an Israeli flag and cannon were
scribbled on a classroom blackboard, the newspapers said.
   Palestinian schools, closed by the Israeli military to contain
the 17-month-old uprising against Israeli rule, are frequently used
as temporary barracks during raids on villages.
   An army spokesman confirmed the school master ``found pages of
the holy Koran that had been used as toilet paper.''
   A soldier who confessed to the incident ``apologized, saying he
did not read Arabic and did not know that it was a Koran,'' the
spokesman said.
   Troops who occupied the school during the May 22-24 curfew were
told the signficance of what happened so it would not recur, the
spokesman said. No further disciplinary measures were planned, he
said.
   The curfew was imposed on the village while Israeli soldiers
conducted a search-and-arrest raid, Arab reports said.
   Shomron's warning to settlers came at the weekly Cabinet
session, which focused on spiraling clashes between the 70,000
Jewish settlers and the 1.7 million Palestinians in the
territories, Israeli newspapers said today.
   Referring to settler attacks on Palestinian homes and vehicles,
Shomron was quoted as saying: ``The army doesn't need to be spurred
on by the settlers who are taking independent action against
Arabs.''
   In response, a settlement leader, Rabbi Moshe Levinger, speaking
on Isreal radio, accused the government of failing to provide
adequate protection against stoning attacks by Palestinians.
   Levinger will stand trial next month for manslaughter in the
August 1988 shooting death of a Palestinian merchant.
   Eighteen of the 498 Palestinians who have been killed in the
Palestinian uprising are believed to have been slain by Israeli
civilians. Twenty-two Israelis also have died in the violence.
   The worst clash today occurred in Silwad in the West Bank when
troops opened fire on youths who tried to prevent the soldiers from
entering the village, Arab reports said. A 25-year-old man was
reported in serious condition at Ramallah hospital with a gunshot
wound in the head.
   In the Gaza Strip, two Palestinians, aged 8 and 13, were
reported hospitalized with gunshot wounds after throwing stones at
soldiers.

   The medical team that operated on Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to stop intestinal bleeding said
today that he was taking solid food again, Tehran radio reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said the spiritual leader
was making satisfactory progress after surgery on Tuesday and that
his digestive system was functioning normally.
   Also today, the main Iranian opposition group claimed Khomeini
suffered a heart attack four days after the surgery in a Tehran
hospital.
   The claim by the Mujahedeen Khalq, made in a statement sent to
The Associated Press in Cyprus, could not be independently
verified. However, Tehran television reported Khomeini suffered
discomfort in his heart that was treated and relieved. The
broadcast gave no details.
   Surgery was carried out on Khomeini's duodenum. In the
broadcast, the medical team also said Khomeini underwent a previous
operation on his prostate gland but did not say when that surgery
occurred.
   Khomeini has been reported ailing since he suffered a heart
attack in 1986. Since then, he has rarely been seen outside his
suburban Tehran home.
   Official reports for years listed Khomeini's age at 89, but his
brother, Pasandideh, said after the operation that Khomeini was 86.

   Here is a transcript of President
Bush's meeting with reporters Monday at which he announced a
four-point U.S. arms-control initiative:
   I'll have a brief statement before taking some questions. This
morning I met with the other NATO leaders and shared with them my
views on the role of the North Atlantic alliance in a changing
Europe. NATO, we all agree, is one of the great success stories,
and it's guaranteed the peace in Europe, provided a shield for 40
years of freedom and prosperity.
   And, now, our alliance faces new challenges at a time of
historic transition as we seek to overcome the division of Europe.
I call it beyond containment.
   And today I am proposing a major initiative to help move us
toward that momentous objective. If it were accepted, it would be a
revolutionary conventional arms control agreement.
   I believe the alliance should act decisively now to take
advantage of this extraordinary opportunity and I urge that NATO
adopt a four-point proposal to bring the Vienna negotiations to a
speedy conclusion.
   First, lock in Eastern acceptance of the proposed Western
ceilings on each side's holdings of tanks and armored troop
carriers. Additionally, we would seek agreement on a similar
ceiling for artillery, provided there are some definitional
questions that have to be resolved there. But all of the equipment
reduced would be destroyed.
   We would then, No. 2, expand our current NATO proposal so that
each side would reduce to 15 percent below current NATO levels in
two additional categories: Attack and assault, or transport,
helicopters; and all land-based combat aircraft. All of the
equipment reduced would be destroyed.
   And third, propose a 20 percent cut in combat manpower in United
States-stationed forces and a resulting ceiling in U.S. and Soviet
ground and air forces stationed outside of national territory in
the Atlantic to the Ural zone at approximately 275,000 each. This
manpower ceiling will require the Soviets to reduce their forces in
Eastern Europe by about 325,000 people. Withdrawn soldiers and
airmen on both sides would be demobilized.
   And then, fourthly, accelerate the timetable for reaching a CFE
(conventional forces in Europe) agreement along these lines and
implementing the required reductions. I believe it should be
possible to reach such agreement in six months or maybe a year and
to accomplish the reductions by 1992 or 1993.
   Now, if the Soviet Union accepts this fair offer, the results
would dramatically increase stability on the continent and
transform the military map of Europe.
   We can and must begin now to set out a new vision for Europe at
the end of this century.
   This is a noble mission that I believe the alliance should be
ready to undertake. And I have no doubt that we are up to the task.
And, incidentally, in addition to these arms control proposals I
mentioned in there that we are prepared to change our no-exceptions
policy on trade. And I called again for a ban on chemical weapons.
And I would reiterate my support for our open-skies proposal and in
the meeting it was discussed by the president _ the prime minister
of Canada.
   Helen?
   Q: Mr. President, does this plan signal _ this revolutionary
plan signal _ the end of the Cold War?
   A: Well, I don't know what it signals. Except it signals a
willingness on our part to really put Mr. Gorbachev to the test
now. And so I don't like to dwell in antiquated history but I do
like to get the idea that we are out front as an alliance, because
this has broad alliance support, in challenging Mr. Gorbachev to
move forward now more quickly on the most destabilizing part of the
military balance, and that is on conventional forces.
   Q: Well, were you pressure by him and the allies?
   A: No. I think I said when I first came in we are going to take
our time and we are going to study and we are going to think it
out. And we did exactly that. And you know and I know that some
voices were raised in Congress that we are going too slow. But we
knew exactly what we were doing all along and we have now said this
is what we suggest and this is the way we plan to lead _ lead the
alliance and lead the free world.
   Q: Mr. President, why is it possible make such drastic cuts in
conventional weapons and not move on nuclear ... ground-based,
short-range missiles, which seems to disturb the Germans and really
a majority of the alliance?
   A: Because the conventional forces, the existing imbalance is so
great that that is the most urgent problem and the most
destabilizing.
   Q: Following up on that question, if the Soviets accept this
proposal, would that enable us to talk about reducing or
eliminating short-range forces?
   A: After agreement was reached and after there was some
implementation, yes. We are not unwilling to negotiate on SNF
(strategic nuclear forces).
   Q: What was the reaction of the NATO leaders this morning when
you told them? Did you consult with all the allies before you put
it on the table?
   A: We had widespread _ and I would think every one was
consulted. I know we had widespread consultation and _
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III: The answer is yes.
   Bush: The answer is yes to all NATO members. It has been done
over the last few days.
   Q: What did you tell them about it? Why did they find it
appealing?
   Bush? I'll leave it to them to wax euphoric but I'll tell you I
was very, very pleased with the response in the meeting just
concluded.
   Q: Mr. President, can you ever see a time when you might not
have nuclear forces in Europe?
   A: No.
   Q: Never? ...
   A: Because the _ we need the concept of flexible response and I
can't in the foreseeable future see us getting away from that.
   Q: Is there any indication that this disagreement with the West
Germans over the SNF issue will be resolved here at the NATO summit?
   A: Well, I'm not really at liberty to go into too much on that,
because right now they've put together, we put together, a working
group to try to work out some resolution. But you see, this
proposal, bold proposal in terms of conventional forces, should
give those who have had difficulty with our position on SNF a
chance to regroup and rethink and give them a little leeway that
they haven't had heretofore.
   Q: Do you expect early negotiation by the secretary of state
with Mr. Shevardnadze or Mr. Gorbachev on this proposal, Mr.
President?
   A: The sooner the better.

   Q: There's been some criticism in Congress as you mentioned that
you have been too cautious in approaching the Soviet Union. Was
that sentiment expressed today by anyone? And how did they _ was
there any mention of how the West should respond to Gorbachev?
   A: No, it wasn't mentioned by anyone in there. Generally when it
was, your question about how to respond to Gorbachev, without
putting words into their mouths of various participants, there was
enthusiastic endorsement. I can't speak for everybody, but for
those who have intervened so far.
   Q: Mr. Bush, have you costed out this proposal and did the
budget constraints play any part in your decision to try to _
   A: No. The budgetary constraints didn't and I haven't seen a
full cost analysis. Some of this would be quite expensive for us,
short run _ the pulling people out. But we did check militarily. I
did not want to propose something that was militarily unsound. Our
top military people are for this. Our SACEUR (supreme allied
commander, Europe) commander, who wears many hats and represents
many countries obviously is for this. So we checked it in that
sense.
   Q: Mr. President, in some of your early speeches you expressed
deep skepticism about what was going on in the Soviet Union. You
said this new relationship cannot be bestowed, it must be earned.
Your secretary of defense said he felt Gorbachev would fail. What
prompted change in your thinking, to make a proposal like this?
   A: This is to put it to the test. This is to say here we go,
we're out there now with a proposal that the United States puts
forward and that has widespread alliance support. Now test it. How
serious are you? Are you _ really want to reduce the imbalances
that exist in all these categories or do we want rhetoric?
   And so what we're saying _ we're not changing _ I'm not changing
my mind. I've said I want to see perestroika succeed. I've said I
want to see us move forward in arms reduction. Indeed, we've set a
date for the resumption of the START talks. But eyes wide open. And
here we go now, on the offense, with a proposal that is bold and
tests whether the Soviet Union will move toward balance or whether
they insist on retaining an unacceptable conventional force
imbalance.
   Q: On the question of Mr. Gorbachev, do you believe he will fail?
   A: I want to see him succeed. And I've said that and I'll repeat
it here. I'm not making predictions as to what's going to happen
inside the Soviet Union. Those are hard tea leaves to read. But I
would like to see him succeed. He seems stronger now than he has
been earlier on, but he faces enormous problems and I hope he looks
at this proposal as a way to help solve some of those enormous
problems. It gets to the question of finance to maintain this
number of troops outside of his country.
   Q: Mr. President, does this four-point proposal represent your
conditions before, that the Soviets must accept before you will
open talks on the short-range missiles?
   A: As I said earlier, we've got to have a reduction in
conventional forces and then some implementation of that proposal.
   Q: Mr. President, you described this as a proposal to the other
allies. Do you expect it's going to be adopted as a formal alliance
position at the end of this meeting and then will you put it on the
table at CFE very soon?
   A: I can't answer that procedurally. I'd like to see it adopted,
but I don't know that people have had enough time to really _ do
you know what's planned on that, Al?
   Alton G. Keel Jr., U.S. representative to NATO: I think,
clearly, the alliance will adopt it, Mr. President, in terms of the
concept but then will assign it to the proper mechanism here at
NATO to finish the details on it.
   Q: Why actually destroy the equipment and demobilize the troops?
   A: Well, because then we get verified, we hope, verified
reductions that last. You can't just juggle around the players on
the chessboard.
   Q: Mr. President, ... there's been a lot of talk at the White
House lately about public relations gambits. Do you believe that
this initiative by the United States puts Mr. Gorbachev on the
defensive, and does it in any way put the United States back on top
of any public relations war that might be going on?
   A: Well, one, we're eschewed getting involved in a public
relations battle. This is too serious a business. Alliance security
is too serious. The safety and security of American forces, for
which I have direct responsibility as commander in chief, is too
serious to be jeopardized by feeling we always have to be out front
on some public relations gambit. And I think we all know that in
certain quarters in the United States my administration has taken a
little bit of a hammering for not engaging in the public relations
battle.
   But what we've been doing is formulating what I think is a very
prudent plan and now that plan is out there on the table. So I
really can't comment on the public relations aspect. What I'm
interested in the security aspect and the strength of the alliance
and then the future _ the ability of the alliance to move beyond
containment.
   Q: A long-term benefit of this proposal would obviously be a
decrease in defense spending. Now, how much of this proposal was
driven by budget considerations?
   A: Well, I thought I answered that, but let me try again to be
clearer. None. What drove the proposal was the military and
alliance considerations and I would agree that if this proposal is
fully implemented, longer run, as you put it, it would have
budgetary _ would result in less spending, particularly if the
troops are, and the weapons are demobilized, as we say.
   Q: Mr. President, just to be clear on one point. What you're
proposing is an agreement with the Warsaw Pact, not anything that
you will do unilaterally, that you won't take any of these steps
yourselves outside an overall agreement with the _greater than

   A: This is a NATO proposal and it would be negotiated with the
Pact. But it means that, obviously, when you're dealing with the
Pact that the Soviet Union is going to have to be the key player.
And the proposal _ this part of the proposal as it relates to U.S.
troops _ clearly is one where there's _ both the Soviet general
secretary and I have to have agreement.
   But I want to keep the negotiations and the initiatives inside
of the alliance. We came over here to say the alliance has worked.
It's kept the peace for 40 years. And we want to continue to keep
it strong. And that's one reason I am very pleased with the
alliance response to our proposal. They don't see it as soloing off
there or taking care of U.S. interests. They see it as in the
interests of the alliance.
   And again I believe I speak, I believe, well, I know most of the
people there feel that way and I hope all of them.
   This is the last one and then I'm going in peace.
   Q: A ticktock question. When you make the final decision to
accept this idea? How did it evolve?
   A: Twelve days ago.
   Q: One last one, sir. Do you have any interest in discussing
this with Mr. Gorbachev at a summit meeting? Do you have any
interest or intention of discussing this proposal or other arms
proposals with Mr. Gorbachev at a summit meeting?
   A: When I have a summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, I expect
we'll associate a wide _ discuss a wide array of subjects.
   Q: Do you anticipate that this year?
   A: When that happens, I will have wide, far-flung discussions
and no date has been set for that.
   Q: Is it likely to be speeded up, though, Mr. President, because
of this proposal?
   A; Hadn't thought of it ... in this connection. But I would not
rule that out. But we'll see how it's digested there in Moscow. I
hope favorably.
   Q: Isn't it time for a summit now, sir, now that you've laid
this out?
   A: Baker's got some more work to do.

   Brazilian racer Emerson Fittipaldi became
the first foreigner in 23 years to win the Indianapolis 500 and
came close to a speed record in the Memorial Day classic.
   ``What a race! What a race!'' Fittipaldi said. ``I cannot
believe it. I dreamed so much of this ever since I was a little
boy.''
   Seven caution periods held Fittipaldi's average speed to 167.581
mph, just short of Bobby Rahal's 1986 record of 170.722.
   Michael Andretti, son of 1969 winner Mario Andretti, fell out of
the race with a broken engine while leading Fittipaldi. Then Al
Unser, Jr. raced past but his hopes of joining his father and uncle
Bobby in victory circle ended when he and Fittipaldi bumped and
Unser crashed into the wall less than two laps from the end.
   Fittipaldi and Unser were so far ahead that when Fittipaldi
finished under the yellow caution flag, Unser had not been passed
and was awarded second place. Raul Boesel of Brazil was third,
Mario Andretti was fourth and A.J. Foyt fifth.
   In the worst accident in the race, Kevin Cogan, the 1986
runner-up, tapped the outside wall, launching his car across the
track and backward into the inside wall. It ricocheted down pit
road, flipped over and slammed sideways into a guardrail, but Cogan
scrambled out of the twisted wreckage, and was released from a
hospital after a checkup.
   The last foreigner to win at Indy was the late Englishman Graham
Hill in 1966. Mario Andretti was born in Italy but came to the
United States as a boy and later became a naturalized American.

<TEXT>
   President Raul Alfonsin has
announced an emergency package aimed at easing an economic crisis
that caused looting of supermarkets and food stores in major cities.
   Alfonsin, in a nationally televised speech, promised Sunday
night that his lame-duck government will make sure food gets to the
people in an ``extremely dangerous and cruelly damaging'' economic
crisis.
   As he spoke in Rosario, the nation's third-largest city, looters
raided about 50 food stores in groups of 20 to 40 people, according
to a local public safety director, Edgardo Zotto.
   The official news agency Telam said 20 people were arrested in
the city, 150 miles north of the capital. Police, a specialized
military unit and firefighters were patrolling the city, the agency
said. ``Residents of the poorest neighborhoods took part in the
lootings,'' Zotto said.
   The incidents were similar to dozens of others that began
Tuesday in Cordoba, the second largest city, and quickly spread to
other cities, including working-class suburbs of the capital.
   Some looters have eaten food in the stores.
   The looting was the first of its kind in Argentina, although it
has been common in other South American countries such as Brazil.
   The General Labor Confederation was to meet in the capital today
to decide whether to stage a general strike, the 14th against the
government since Alfonsin took office in December 1983.
   In his speech, Alfonsin called on Argentines to ``roll up your
sleeves and go to work'' to ensure that emergency steps work.
   ``The government will dictate clear and tough rules to put an
end to the risk of hyperinflation, will surgically put state
finances in order and will severely punish speculative maneuvers,''
Alfonsin said.
   He also offered to ``modify some of our criteria'' to fit plans
of the President-elect Carlos Menem and the Peronist Party, who
defeated the governing Radical Civic Union in May 14 elections.
Menem replaces Alfonsin on Dec. 10.
   Alfonsin's measures, some of which require congressional
approval, include a return to monetary exchange controls with an
official exchange rate for the austral, Argentina's currency, which
has lost 90 percent of its value over the last four months.
   Alfonsin did not say what the official value of the austral
would be. The Central Bank announced Sunday that an exchange
holiday, ordered on May 22, would remain in effect today.
   The austral had been allowed to float since early February, when
17 bought a dollar. The currency closed at 170 to the dollar on the
last day exchange markets were open.
   Exchange operations will be closely watched and violations of
controls will be considered crimes, Alfonsin said.
   The exchange markets and the banking system will be
``progressively regularized'' Alfonsin said. Banks, which fear a
run on deposits, were closed May 22 and 23 and were allowed to open
May 24 with withdrawals limited to 20,000 australs (about $100)
every two days.
   Consumer price policies will remain unchanged, Alfonsin said.
Although the government has not set price ceilings for consumer
goods, prices may not be increased without specific official
approval.
   Retailers have ignored the regulations, marking up prices almost
daily and the cost of living increase for May is expected to top 60
percent.
   ``Excesses will not be tolerated, especially those that have
been observed in recent days,'' Alfonsin said.
   He also warned that pricing of goods in any currency other than
the austral will be punishable by law. Numerous retailers recently
have begun pricing goods in dollars.
   Government spending also will be cut, and a scheduled
presidential trip to France will be canceled, Alfonsin said.
   The emergency plan ``must become everyone's program or it is
condemned to failure,'' he said. ``I ask each and every Argentine
to occupy his battle station.''

   Operators of the Seabrook nuclear power
plant today began the low-power testing process, with the first
atomic chain reaction expected within seven to 10 days.
   Atomic operation will be the biggest milestone yet for a plant
that is a decade behind schedule, billions of dollars over budget
and a focus of the nation's anti-nuclear movement.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Friday gave Seabrook its
low-power license. After reading voluminous technical
specifications accompanying it, plant operators at 11 a.m. began
opening valves and making other preparations for a five-day reactor
heat-up process, Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher said.
   Barring any problems, the first atomic chain reaction in
Seabrook's 100 tons of uranium fuel could start within several days
after the heatup is completed.

   U.S. and German soldiers reunited in Chicago, flags adorned a
highway in rural Nebraska and a memorial to Vietnam veterans was
dedicated in Baltimore as the nation paused to honor its war dead
on the Memorial Day weekend.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis attended a ceremony today
in Beaufort, S.C., to bury the remains of 19 black Union soldiers
missing in action since 1863. The remains are believed to be those
of members of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment _ the first black
regiment in the nation's history.
   ``This is a very, very interesting chapter of American history,
not one most are familiar with,'' Dukakis said after he arrived for
the ceremony. ``This issue of black men fighting for the Union Army
was highly controversial at the time. I'm proud to say they were
supported by the people of Massachusetts.''
   Revelers enjoying the start of the summer vacation season
flocked to the nation's parks and beaches Sunday. Thousands
attended the Jambalaya Jam festival in Philadelphia, while hundreds
lined a beach in Wildwood, N.J., to watch the East Coast Stunt Kite
Festival.
   In many places, however, traditional observances were altered to
provide moments of solemn reflection on the sacrifices made by
Americans who lost their lives in wartime.
   In New York, several thousand people stood quietly as a
fireworks display ended with a lone bugle playing ``Taps'' as a
barge off of the South Street Seaport was enveloped in red smoke
and fire.
   ``This isn't to make the drunk guys with hot dogs cheer. Anyone
can do that,'' said Bruce Bassman of Garden State Fireworks of
Millington, N.J. ``But to get them to cry, to bring them to some
kind of feeling.''
   And there were no parades, bands or speeches at a ceremony at
the Tidewater Veterans Memorial in Virginia Beach, where
participants received flags bearing the name of a serviceman who
died in combat.
   ``Last year we had speeches and bands,'' said Harold Heischober
of the Disabled American Veterans. ``This is a little different.
This is the people's day. The people are the ceremony.''
   In western Nebraska, travelers passing the Paxton Cemetery along
Interstate 80 could view 109 flags representing veterans who had a
connection to the rural community. Many of the flags had draped a
veteran's casket.
   In Chicago, about 150 U.S. Navy veterans joined with their
former adversaries to commemorate the only capture of a German
submarine during World War II.
   ``Many of the men in this engagement, both American and German,
have been transferred to another realm by our supreme commander,
but we must remember them and honor them, for they will always be a
part of us,'' retired Adm. Earl Trosino, who led the boarding party
during the capture, told the crowd, which included three of the
German sailors who were on the U-505 submarine captured June 4,
1944 off the coast of west Africa.
   About 3,500 people attended the dedication of a monument to
Vietnam veterans at a memorial service in Baltimore. Family members
and friends rubbed the names of loved ones onto paper at the
memorial, modeled after the wall commemorating Vietnam veterans in
Washington.
   In other Memorial Day activities around the nation:
   _ Vice President Dan Quayle was among an estimated 400,000
people at the Indianapolis 500 Sunday. Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi
won the race.
   _ Tuan Tuong Nguyen, a much-decorated captain in the former army
of South Vietnam, will be among the participants today at a service
at the Oregon Vietnam Veterans Living Memorial.
   _ More than 1,000 people gathered in a sea of candlelight in Los
Angeles Sunday night in memory of their friends and relatives who
have died of AIDS. The rally was one of more than 100 marches
planned in cities around the world in an effort called Candlelight
'89.
   _ More than 2,000 Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts placed flower leis
and small flags at the 32,000 graves at the National Memorial
Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu. The leis were made by Hawaii's
schoolchildren.
   _ A John F. Kennedy Regatta was held in Boston Harbor Saturday
as part of a weekend celebration planned by the Kennedy family to
focus attention on the late president's 72nd birthday today, rather
than the date of his assassination.

   Tickets for a Mass to be celebrated by
Pope John Paul in Finland next week are being sold on the black
market for about $160, reports said Monday.
   The Roman Catholic Church condemned the scalpers, saying all
7,900 tickets it has given out were free.
   ``There are still about 1,000 people on the waiting list for the
holy mass,'' church authorities said.
   There are 4,200 Catholics in Finland, according to figures
published by the Catholic Information Bureau.
   The pope is scheduled to visit Finland June 4-6 during a tour
that also takes him to Norway, Iceland, Denmark and Sweden.
   It will be the first papal visit to this predominantly Lutheran
country where 88 percent of the population of 4.9 million belong to
the national church.

<HEAD>Sister Cities Conference Opens in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The inaugural conference of U.S.-Soviet sister
cities opened in Tashkent on Monday with messages from President
Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev praising the program as
a bridge between the two nations.
   Officials, educators and community leaders from about 100 cities
in the United States and the Soviet Union gathered in the
Uzbekistan capital, 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow, to discuss the
linking of cities and exchange programs, the official Tass news
agency said. Tashkent is the sister city of Seattle.
   ``The rapid expansion of the sister cities program reflects the
desire for increased contacts between the American and Soviet
people,'' Bush said in a telegram to the conference, expected to
last three days.
   Tass transmitted the remarks of both Gorbachev and Bush.
   Bush said the twin cities program proved its effectiveness in
relief operations following the Armenian earthquake in December
that killed 25,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless.
   ``I had an opportunity to learn firsthand about sister city
activities when I met with Vice Mayor Babken Vardanyan of Yerevan,
Armenia, and Vice Mayor Alice Wolf of Cambridge, Mass., for a
briefing on the Yerevan-Cambridge program and its role in assisting
earthquake relief efforts in Armenia,'' Bush said.
   He said the program had transcended ceremonial exchanges and
emerged as a platform for practical partnerships.
   Gorbachev, in his message to the conference, said the sister
cities program was an effective form of diplomacy. ``It enhances
the human dimension of Soviet-American relations and enables
thousands of people, Soviet and American citizens, to get
acquainted, discuss questions of interest and work jointly,'' he
said.
   ``I would like to thank again American cities whose people
showed genuine human solidarity when the earthquake hit Armenia,''
Gorbachev said.
   He said the program did away with stereotypes inherited from the
Cold War and helped build confidence between the two nations.

   The Central African
Republic cut diplomatic ties with neighboring Sudan and closed its
borders after President Andre Kolingba's plane was refused entry
into Sudanese airspace, officials said.
   The announcement was read on the Central African Republic's
national radio by Cabinet Secretary Edouard Frank.
   Frank said the government was deeply indignant at the
``unfriendly attitude'' of Sudanese authorities.
   Kolingba had accepted an invitation to visit ``a friendly
country'' and left Bangui Sunday on a ``mission of peace,'' he said.
   ``As the presidential aircraft approached Sudanese airspace, the
pilot was forbidden to enter, despite an authorization given for
the overflight by this country and passed to the Central African
authorities through the Sudanese embassy in Bangui, dated May 15,''
the statement said.
   Despite efforts by the pilot to convince the Sudanese
authorities that the president was aboard, the plane was refused
permission to proceed.
   The statement said authorities in Bangui were ``surprised at the
unfriendly attitude of a neighboring, brotherly country with which
there has always been excellent relations of friendship and
cooperation.''

   A cyclone that tore across Bangladesh

a million homeless, officials and news reports said Monday.
   Tens of thousands of mud and straw huts were blown away during
the storm on Saturday that was accompanied by winds up to 85 mph,
they said.
   At least 49 people died in India and 35 in Bangladesh, they said.
   Relief Ministry officials said the storm also injured 600 people
in Bangladesh.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
death toll was likely to rise because at least 150 fishermen were
missing and feared dead in the Bay of Bengal off the southwestern
coast.
   An Indian news agency, Press Trust of India, said at least 33
people died after the cyclone struck the eastern Indian state of
West Bengal. At least 16 people died in neighboring Orissa state,
it said.
   The storm also left at least 500,000 people homeless in the two
states.

<HEAD>Prosecutors End Investigation into Bribery Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors on Monday ended their investigation
into a bribery scandal that brought down Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita and shook public confidence in the government.
   The prosecutors closed the eight-month inquiry by bringing
misdemeanor charges against four aides to senior politicians.
Another 13 businessmen, bureaucrats and legislators have been
charged with bribery in the scandal.
   ``The prosecutors have done everything that they should have,''
said Justice Minister Masami Takatsuji.
   Much of the ruling party elite has been implicated in the
scandal that sent public approval ratings of the government to
all-time lows. A close aide to Takeshita committed suicide April
26, the day after the prime minister said he would resign.
   But only two lawmakers face prosecution in the scandal and the
announcement of the investigation's end drew immediate charges that
others who might be involved in the scandal had gotten away.
   ``This will not satisfy the citizens of Japan,'' Tsuruo
Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the opposition Japan Socialist
Party, said.
   Yamaguchi called for further questioning in parliament of former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who Monday resigned from the
governing Liberal Democratic Party. Last week, Nakasone testified
before a parliamentary committee about his links to Recruit Co.,
and acknowledged receiving $320,000 from the publishing giant.
   But Nakasone insisted he was innocent of any wrongdoing and
refused demands from opposition parties to resign from parliament
to take responsibility for the scandal, which occurred during his
1982-87 term as prime minister.
   Takeshita, who said he would step down after he acknowledged
receiving $1 million from Recruit, urged party elders to accept
Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno as his successor. Takeshita hinted
that he and his Cabinet will resign Thursday.
   The resignations will be followed by a party convention to elect
a new party president and on Friday, parliament is expected to
elect a new prime minister. Because the Liberal Democrats hold a
large majority in both houses, the party choice will automatically
be voted prime minister.
   Uno, 66, who was first elected to the House of Representatives
in 1960, has been minister of international trade and industry and
head of the Defense Agency. He is not linked to the Recruit scandal
and has experience in foreign affairs.
   But some party members have said Uno lacks the experience in
party affairs that is indispensable to carry out needed reforms and
salvage the party's plunging popularity.
   Recruit is accused of trying to influence the government by
handing out millions of dollars in political donations and selling
underpriced, unlisted stock shares to business and political
leaders in 1986. The stock quickly rose in price when placed on the
market, and those who received the unlisted shares reaped tens of
thousands of dollars in profits.
   Charged Monday were Tsuneo Hattori, an aide to former Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa; Fumio Shimizu, a aide to Liberal
Democratic Party secretary- General Shintaro Abe; and Kikuo
Katayama and Masayoshi Sakamaki, aides to former Agriculture
Minister Mutsuki Kato.
   The four allegedly failed to report donations from Recruit. If
found guilty of the misdemeanor charges, they face fines of up to
$1,400.

   Anatoly I. Lukyanov was virtually unknown to the
country when he was confirmed Monday as vice president to his old
law school classmate, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The televised questioning of Lukyanov by deputies in the Soviet
parliament gave millions their first glimpse of the trim,
bespectacled legal specialist who has worked his whole life in the
state and Communist Party apparatus.
   Lukyanov, 59, emerged from the process as a man adept at the
age-old political skill of evading piercing questions and, as could
be expected, a loyal supporter of Gorbachev, who was once his
deputy.
   Historian Roy A. Medvedev disclosed during the questioning that
in the early 1950s, Lukyanov was chairman of a party youth
committee at Moscow State University when Gorbachev was its vice
chairman. Both were studying law at the university.
   Lukyanov fielded dozens of questions from members of the
Congress of People's Deputies, ranging from his attitude toward the
rising crime rate to the 1939 Soviet-German pact that led to the
forced incorporation of the Baltic republics into the Soviet Union.
   Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze, of the southern republic of Georgia,
demanded to know Lukyanov's exact role in events that led anti-riot
forces to move against pro-independence demonstrators in Tbilisi on
April 9, resulting in at least 20 deaths.
   As with most other questions, Lukyanov carefully sidestepped a
direct answer, pointing to ongoing investigations of the events.
   Medvedev questioned whether Lukyanov will pursue Gorbachev's
policies faithfully. When Gorbachev is abroad or on vacation,
policy sometimes changes ``50, 60 or even 180 degrees,'' Medvedev
said.
   Lukyanov replied with general statements of support for
Gorbachev's efforts to democratize the Soviet Union and remove the
Stalinist abuses of the past.
   Western analysts assume the old ties and similarities between
the two prompted Gorbachev last fall to pluck Lukyanov from the
obscurity of the bureaucracy to make him a candidate member of the
party's ruling Politburo and vice president of the Supreme Soviet,
the old parliament.
   On Monday, under the restructured political system that permits
Gorbachev to pick his own vice president, subject to confirmation
by the congress, he won overwhelming backing as first deputy of the
chairman of the Supreme Soviet, or _ more simply _ vice-president.
   According to constitutional reforms approved last year, the
first deputy and a yet-to-be-determined number of deputies to
Gorbachev can ``fulfill certain (of the president's) functions'' if
Gorbachev authorizes them to do so.
   They also are entitled to replace Gorbachev ``in the case of his
absence or if he is incapable of performing his duties.'' The
constitution does not specifically make Lukyanov Gorbachev's
successor in such event.
   Little is known about Lukyanov's early career. He was born May
7, 1930, in Smolensk and began work at 13 in a World War II
munitions factory in the Saratov region on the Volga River in
southern Russia.
   Joining the Communist Party in 1955, Lukyanov went to work as a
government legal consultant after completing his legal studies in
1956.
   In that capacity, he helped reach agreements on Soviet
assistance to Poland and Hungary in 1956, when both countries saw
uprisings against Stalinist rule.
   In 1985, when Gorbachev became party chief, Lukyanov was named
to head the party Central Committee's General Department, which
handles domestic affairs. In 1987, he rose to become Central
Committee secretary for Politburo staff work and supervision of the
military, security intelligence and legal institutions.
   Lukyanov is known to have visited Denmark in 1986 and Yugoslavia
in 1987. But his answer to a question on his role in Czechoslovakia
after the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of 1968 suggested he was
among the ``many of us who went out'' to help Czechoslovakia's
Communist Party and youth organizations after the invasion.
   It is not known whether Lukyanov, an ethnic Russian, is married
or has children.

   Parliamentarians regard raising their
constituents' standard of living as the government's most important
task, but they doubt that they can do much about it, according to a
poll released Monday.
   The Communist Party academy that conducted the poll said it
found roughly half the members of the new Congress of People's
Deputies hold relatively moderate views, whereas there appear to be
more reformers than conservatives in the body.
   The poll results, distributed at the congress, reported 74
percent of the members questioned said ``progess toward a higher
standard of living'' was the most important goal.
   In answer to another question, 55 percent said they thought
their sessions could have a positive, but not significant, effect
on living standards, and 27 percent said they could do nothing to
improve economic conditions.
   The poll of 1,347 of the 2,250 deputies was conducted Saturday
by the Communist Party Central Committee's Academy of Social
Sciences. That was the same day the congress broke into an angry
debate over the selection of members of the 542 members of the
Supreme Soviet standing legislature.
   An outnumbered group of reformers complained that regional
officials had stacked the lists of candidates with legislators who
would preserve the status quo.
   The pollsters said the balance of power in the session was held
by a moderate group of about 40 percent to 55 percent of the
deputies.
   Their report also identified a ``group with more radical
expectations and lesser satisfaction'' consisting of about 25
percent to 30 percent of those polled, and on the other side a
group with ``more cautious approaches, exhibiting a greater degree
of satisfaction'' consisting of about 15 percent to 20 percent of
the members.
   The deputies said they could have the greatest effect in making
Soviet society more open and democratic. Sixty percent responded
they could significantly improve openness and freedom of speech,
and another 29 percent said they were capable of making a less
noticeable improvement.
   The report said 74 percent did not regard the opening of Soviet
society as irreversible or considered the changes so far as only
half-measures.
   The proceedings of the body, ranging from long-winded discussion
of parliamentary procedure to angry debate and pointed
interrogation of the Kremlin leadership, have been televised live.
   The figures also indicated that 55 percent found their
expectations of the congress more or less fulfilled by its first
days, but an almost equal number _ 54 percent _ were dissatisfied
with the handling of procedural questions. Twenty-seven percent
were most upset about the behavior of other deputies, and 26
percent were most upset by a lack of organization.
   A poll of 1,832 citizens by the Soviet Academy of Sciences in
six cities on Friday indicated a vast majority of those polled were
following the Congress carefully in broadcasts from Moscow and
generally approved of what they saw. That poll was published Monday
by the government newspaper Izvestia.

   President Bush today proposed a 20
percent cut in U.S. combat troops in Europe and challenged Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to order comparable troop
withdrawals to ``transform the military map'' by 1993.
   ``Here we go now, on the offense, with a proposal that will test
the Soviet Union,'' said Bush, clearly seeking to seize the
initiative in East-West relations at the opening of the two-day
NATO summit.
   Finessing a divisive quarrel among Western leaders over the
issue of modernizing short-range nuclear missiles, Bush countered
Gorbachev's recent disarmament proposals with a major plan to
achieve balance between the conventional forces of NATO and
East-bloc Warsaw Pact armies.
   Challenging Gorbachev at a televised news conference after he
outlined his proposals for 15 other NATO leaders, Bush asked: ``How
serious are you? Do you really want to reduce the imbalance ... or
do you just want rhetoric?''
   Bush's plan includes a ceiling of 275,000 troops each for the
American and Soviet sides in Europe, which would require a 20
percent reduction in U.S. troop strength and a withdrawal of
325,000 Soviet troops to achieve the same level.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said NATO leaders
unanimously endorsed the proposal, which is to be offered at
conventional forces talks with the Soviets.
   U.S. troop levels in Western Europe now range between 305,000
and 325,000, while some Western estimates put Soviet troop strength
in Central and Eastern Europe at more than 600,000.
   The 20 percent reduction applies to the 150,000 U.S. combat
troops stationed in NATO countries. Once an additional 150,000
support personnel are taken into account, Bush's cutback would
affect about 10 percent of the U.S. military force in Europe.
   After first briefing the Western allies privately, Bush sent
Gorbachev a letter on Sunday outlining the U.S. proposals.
   Today, Bush won an enthusiastic response from Western leaders
who had been pressing Washington to regain the offensive from
Gorbachev.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Bush's proposals
had ``transformed the summit,'' and West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl _ a key figure in the missile dispute _ hailed the president's
``great initiative for rapidly reducing conventional arms.''
   Bush thus succeeded in taking the summit spotlight away from
West Germany's demands for early East-West negotiations to reduce
and perhaps eliminate short-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
   Bush ruled out any such negotiations soon, at least until a
comprehensive conventional arms agreement is implemented, and said
he would never accept the idea of a nuclear-free Europe.
   The president said a NATO working group had been established to
seek a compromise on the missile dispute.
   In another major move, Bush said he was recommending that the
West drpop its nine-year automatic ban on transfers of computers
and other high technology to the Soviet Union. This economic
sanction was imposed after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan
in December 1979.
   If the NATO allies give their expected approval, such transfers
would be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine if they
posed a threat to Western security.
   Facing criticism that he has moved too cautiously in responding
to Soviet arms proposals, Bush said, ``Here we go now on the
offense'' with the plan to reduce conventional forces in Europe.
   His plan also included NATO willingness for the first time to
negotiate limits on combat helicopters and aircraft throughout
Europe as part of a convention arms agreement.
   Bush also proposed locking in Soviet acceptance of proposed
Western ceilings on each side's arsenals of tanks and armored troop
carriers, and said a similar ceiling on artillery would be sought.
   Bush urged his NATO partners to endorse his plan and send it to
allied negotiators in conventional force talks with the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact which began in Vienna, Austria, last March.
   He said an agreement could be reached in six months ``or maybe a
year'' if all went well and could be implemented by 1992 or 1993.
   The president said Secretary of States James A. Baker III was
available to meet with Gorbachev or Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, ``the sooner the better.''
   ``If it were accepted, it would be a revolutionary conventional
arms control agreement,'' Bush said.
   ``If the Soviet Union accepts this fair offer, the results would
dramatically increase stabililty on the continent and transform the
military map of Europe,'' he said. ``We can and must begin now to
set out a new vision for Europe at the end of this century.''
   Early this month, Gorbachev offered to accept ceilings on Soviet
forces in all Warsaw Pact countries as well as a ceiling on overall
Soviet forces.
   Bush called his proposals ``a fair offer'' that ``signals a
willingness on our part to really put Mr. Gorbachev to the test.''
   Kohl congratulated Bush for ``this far-sighted step, with which
he has once more impressively affirmed the United States'
leadership.''
   Although Mrs. Thatcher was similarly complimentary, she warned
that ``the interim period will be a time of vulnerability and
risk'' that required maintaining a sufficiency of short-range
nuclear missiles on the continent.
   A small band of protesters prayed, beat drums and distributed
leaflets as Bush entered NATO headquarters this morning with
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   The two days of talks in the barracks-like alliance headquarters
opened with an address by NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner,
who warned against letting the missile dispute jeopardize NATO's
unity in dealing with the Soviets.
   ``Only if we remain united will we determine events,'' Woerner
said. ``Divided, even with all our successes and dynamism, we will
be the victims of events determined by others _ all of us, without
exception.''
   The NATO chief said Gorbachev's reforms were evidence that ``the
East is turning to the West'' and that ``communism has manifestly
failed.''
   But Woerner warned summit leaders against putting their trust in
Gorbachev's good intentions.
   For years, he said, the West will face ``a formidable and
unpredictable military power as our neighbor.'' And while ``we do
not need permanently to suspect his intentions ...'' he said, ``we
cannot build our security on the assumption of his permanent good
will.''
   Outside the main entrance to NATO headquarters, a dozen Japanese
Buddhist monks beat drums and prayed next to a sign in French which
read, ``NATO Bloc, 40 Years is Enough.''
   Other demonstrators handed out leaflets boasting of ``the
imminent separation of the USA from Europe'' because of the dispute
over short-range nuclear missiles and Gorbachev's arms reduction
offers.
   Bush, arriving Sunday evening from a two-day visit to Italy,
declared that ``NATO is at once ready to ensure the common defense
and to reduce arms and seek to diminish tensions with the East.''
   Although the summit had been billed as a celebration of NATO's
40th anniversary, the talks were clouded by discord largely between
the United States and Britain on one side, and West Germany on the
other.
   Responding to disarmament sentiment in West Germany, Bonn has
called for early East-West negotiations on short-range missiles,
most of which are based in West Germany and would be used against
forces on German soil.
   The United States says the weapons are needed to offset superior
conventional forces in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-dietrich Genscher insisted
Sunday at a German political rally that ``disarmament cannot
exclude any kind of weapon.''
   A spokesman for Mrs. Thatcher said it was possible no deal on
the missile issue would be reached at the summit. ``We aren't in
the business of a bad agreement. We are in the business of
retaining flexible defense,'' said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

   The troop cuts proposed Monday by
President Bush pull together the ranks of NATO for its own
disarmament offensive and shelve disunity in the alliance over
short-range nuclear missiles.
   The split between the United States and Britain, on the one
side, and West Germany and many others of the 16 alliance members
over the short-range missiles had stalled a coordinated NATO
response to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's arms
initiatives.
   But, for the sake of a united Western effort to seize momentum
from the Kremlin, West Germany appears now to have put aside its
nuclear grievance.
   The European allies of the United States hailed Bush's call for
equal ceilings on NATO and Warsaw Pact troop levels in Europe.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Bush's proposal
had ``transformed the summit.'' Spanish Foreign Minister Franciso
Fernandez Ordonez said Bush had given a new impetus to conventional
arms talks in Vienna.
   Even West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl hailed the proposal as a
``great initiative'' and said his first priority was that the
summit ``be a success.''
   Bush's move does little to resolve the contentious dispute over
when and whether the superpowers should take Gorbachev up on his
request to negotiate on short-range nuclear missiles deployed in
Europe.
   But Monday's proposal does offer a face-saving alternative for
the Bonn leadership and could set the superpowers on the track
toward substantial cuts in the number of soldiers deployed in
Europe by both military blocs.
   Gorbachev has pushed for reducing the military presence of both
East and West to minimum levels, and earlier this month said he
would be willing to go along with ceilings on troop strength.
   If accepted by both alliances, Bush's proposal would remove at
least 325,000 Soviet soldiers from Europe and at least 30,000
American troops, or _ in all _ about 40 percent of the superpowers'
combined European forces.
   It would also set ceilings on tanks, armored personnel carriers
and artillery pieces, and open negotiations to limit combat
aircraft and helicopters across Europe.
   Pressured by a populace eager to take the Soviet leader at his
word, West German leaders had until Monday insisted that the United
States agree to the Soviet call for short-range missile
negotiations.
   Most of NATO's short-range nuclear weapons arsenal is based in
West Germany, where anti-nuclear sentiments have been gaining
ground since the 1987 superpower treaty calling for the destruction
of all intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   As the medium-range rockets have been removed, NATO has shifted
to West Germany the burden of retaining a nuclear response option
to repel a possible attack by the Warsaw Pact's superior
conventional forces.
   NATO leaders announced soon after beginning their two-day
meeting that the short-range missile issue was being shunted into a
special working group, an apparent effort to focus attention on
Bush's troop cut initiative on which the allies all agree.
   West German government spokesman Hans Klein told reporters the
committee had been established ``to keep the short-range issue from
dominating the summit.''
   In his opening address at the summit, Kohl praised Bush's
proposal but reiterated his government's push for talks on the
short-range nuclear weapons systems.
   ``President Bush has today paved the way for further success of
our alliance,'' Kohl declared. ``I congratulate him on this
far-sighted step.''
   Then, invoking the words of John F. Kennedy, Kohl added:
   ``Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to
negotiate.''
   Asked at a news conference whether short-range weapons talks
could be expected in the future, Bush replied, ``After agreement
was reached and after some implementation (of conventional force
reductions), yes.''
   It was not immediately clear how long Kohl's coalition partners,
especially liberal Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, would
be willing to put off resolution of the nuclear issue.
   Genscher and Kohl are known to be divided on how far West
Germany should push the short-range issue. They arrived separately
for the summit, and their delegations are even in different hotels.
   Bush's troop cut proposal is unlikely to suppress the growing
West German popular movement for reductions in the short-range
missiles stockpiles.
   But it may ease West Germans' concerns about the more than
400,000 foreign troops in their country whose maneuvers and
low-flying training exercises have stirred widespread protest.

   First lady Barbara Bush, accompanied by
Belgium's Queen Fabiola, on Monday comforted a young woman who was
overcome with emotion during a presentation to the president's wife
at a special village for mentally handicapped adults.
   Mrs. Bush, in Brussels with her husband for the NATO summit,
toured the village while the president outlined dramatic new arms
control proposals to the Western leaders.
   The 20-year-old woman, identified only by her first name,
Beatrice, was overcome as she gave the president's wife a
puppet-like witch on a broomstick that she had made herself.
   Mrs. Bush took the present and then, realizing that the young
woman was crying, stepped over and patted her comfortingly on the
shoulder.
   The incident came at the end of the visit by Mrs. Bush and the
queen to the village 20 miles south of Brussels.
   The village, financed mainly with government funds, is home to
175 mentally handicapped adults. It was founded in 1963 by parents
wanting to provide a long-term home for their children once family
members are dead or can no longer care for them.
   ``It's an absolutely wonderful project,'' said Mrs. Bush, adding
that she felt ``honored to be here.''
   The converted brick farmhouse and outlying houses lie in the
shade of trees in quiet gardens filled with flowers. ``It's a very
peaceful place,'' said Mrs. Bush.
   Beatrice, still looking a bit shaken, said afterward that
meeting Mrs. Bush had made her ``very emotional.''
   At one point, the first lady asked Jean Wauters, the president
of the village, about the residency program and whether the
residents were separated from their families.
   The residents live in duplex homes in groups of 12 with a
married couple who look after them. But the residents do their own
housework, choose their menus and, as Mrs. Bush noted, decorate
their bedrooms to their taste.
   During the day, residents work in a shop counting supermarket
discount coupons _ the only such operation in Belgium _ or package
supermarket goods.
   For their 7{-hour working day, the residents are paid between
108 and 210 Belgian francs an hour ($2.50 to $5), which is the
going rate for Belgian manual laborers, said Catherine Mottet, a
psychologist at the village.
   Mrs. Bush was welcomed by two 20-year-old resident, Robert and
Judith, at the start of the morning tour. They gave the first lady
and the queen bouquets of red, white and blue flowers. Judith
needed a little encouragement from the educator who accompanied
them to part with her flowers.
   Mrs. Bush and Fabiola kissed the two.
   The first lady said that more such residences were needed in the
United States.
   Mrs. Bush regretted that she spoke no French. ``I just wish I
could say in French what I really feel.'' But she did manage
``merci beaucoup'' _ thank you very much.
   Mrs. Bush donated to the village a machine for ear, nose and
throat examinations.

   Many Jewish settlers in the
occupied lands believe the army is complacent about stonings and
firebomb attacks, and they are making their own response with raids
on Palestinian communities.
   They beat and shoot Palestinians, burn cars and smash the
windows of houses.
   In a rampage Monday, West Bank settlers attacked Kifl Harith
village near the Ariel settlement, setting crops, olive trees and a
house ablaze. Villagers threw stones and the settlers opened fire,
killing a 16-year-old girl and wounding two other Palestinians,
according to army and Arab reports.
   Her death brought to 18 the number of Arabs killed by Israeli
settlers in nearly 18 months of Palestinian rebellion. In all, 500
Palestinians have been slain, most by soldiers, and 22 Israelis
have died.
   Israeli commentators said the level of violence between the
70,000 settlers and 1.7 million Palestinians is unprecedented since
the uprising began in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Columnist Alex Fishman wrote in the independent newspaper
Hadashot: ``If it isn't stopped now, there will be mutual massacres
between Jews and Arabs.''
   The focus of tension in the West Bank is Hebron, a town of
80,000 Palestinians adjoined by Kiryat Arba, an outpost of 5,000
militant Jews who want the West Bank annexed to Israel.
   In a two-hour period on a recent weekday morning, a reporter saw
three motor patrols of settlers armed with Uzi submachine guns and
pistols drive through the center of town.
   Soldiers also make frequent patrols. Four young Palestinians
darted from a narrow alley and pelted two army jeeps with empty
bottles and rocks, but the troopers fired into the air and the
youths vanished.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, army commander in the West Bank, was
quoted in the Jerusalem Post as telling a parliament committee ``an
explosive situation'' has developed ``because of settler attitudes
and actions.''
   He appealed to the lawmakers to help stop settlers from
assaulting soldiers who try to prevent vigilante raids.
   Settlers contend Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government and
the army command are too lenient with the Palestinians.
   Noam Arnon, spokesman for the Gush Emunin settler movement, said
this week: ``The army doesn't do anything against the Arabs.''
   On the day Mitzna addressed the committee, settlers stopped
Palestinian motorists and beat three of them after a booby-trapped
Israeli flag with a swastika painted on it blew the hand off an
Israeli who picked it up.
   Arab reports said settlers also entered Burin village near
Nablus and beat two men in their homes.
   Last Thursdy night, after two firebombs narrowly missed a
settler outside Kiryat Arba, scores of settlers attacked an Arab
neighborhood of Hebron.
   Jawdat Jabari, 24, said about 100 Jews armed with rifles,
pistols and stones attacked his house, shouting ``Death to the
Arabs!'' He said stones shattered the porch windows and a burst of
gunfire hit the wall near the front door.
   His 21-year-old brother, Judeh, said the raiders knew the
Jabaris well because several members of the family worked at Kiryat
Arba.
   ``Most of those who stoned us used to come to this house and
drink coffee and tea without even knocking on the door,'' Judeh
said, and added angrily: ``There is no way that the Jews and the
Arabs can live together, ever. We will hate them wherever they go.''
   Fakri Attiyah Dana, a 50-year-old vegetable merchant, told of a
raid April 27 by about 50 settlers who burned 1,500 crates stored
on his roof, then shot holes in his water tank. He showed a
reporter 20 bullet holes in the walls.
   As he spoke, four teen-aged Israeli settlers stood on a nearby
hilltop with slingshots, launching stones at passing Arab
motorists. Soldiers arrived 15 minutes later and chased them away.
   Dana claimed five army jeeps accompanied the settlers April 27,
but an army spokesman denied that and other Palestinian claims of
soldiers joining settlers or doing nothing to stop them.
   He said some of the reports might be explained by settlers
wearing reserve army uniforms, a violation of regulations.
   Arnon said the raids were a warning to militant young
Palestinians ``to tell them: `Boys, take it easy. We can also do
something.''
   ``I don't hate anyone,'' said the Gush Emunin spokesman, who
directs the Kiryat Arba religious studies center. ``I want to live
with them in peace, but whosoever attacks me and wants to kill me,
I'll kill them. It is written in the Bible.''

<TEXT>
   Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, who was
denied a seat on the Supreme Soviet over the weekend, won a
position on the new standing legislature today when a Siberian
professor resigned in his favor.
   In a surprise move, the Congress of People's Deputies allowed
Alexei Kazannik to step down and give his seat to Yeltsin, who
received the largest popular vote of any candidate when he won a
seat on the congress in March. On Saturday, the congress chose from
among its members to form the Supreme Soviet.
   Through a quirk in the election procedure, Yeltsin, the former
Moscow party boss and populist candidate, finished last on a list
of 12 candidates for 11 Russian federation seats in one of the two
chambers of the Supreme Soviet.
   He was therefore defeated despite his having received more than
50 percent of the votes cast by his fellow deputies.
   After Yeltsin and other prominent reform-minded deputies were
defeated in their bids for seats in Supreme Soviet, tens of
thousands of people rallied in Moscow to protest. The protesters
charged that the vote by members of the congress was undemocratic,
and television news said a poll found half the people surveyed to
be dissatisfied with how it was held.
   After Kazannik withdrew today, President Mikhail Gorbachev said:
``Inasmuch as comrade Yeltsin received a majority of the vote, the
open place can be filled by him. Naturally, it does not require a
repeat vote.''
   Only a few deputies opposed a proposal by Estonian delegate
Victor Palm to allow Yelstin to take the seat. Gorbachev told
Kazannik the congress ``welcomed his initiative.''
   Earlier today, Gorbachev pushed his little-known choice for vice
president through the Conress of People's Deputies after preventing
competitors from being nominated. Gorbachev made clear from the
outset today that he intended to have the congress confirm his
choice of schoolmate Anatoly I. Lukyanov without allowing competing
nominations from the floor.
   But the Soviet president permitted almost four hours of blunt
and cutting debate before putting the question to a vote.
   Of the 2,250 deputies, only 179 voted against Lukyanov in a show
of hands. There were 137 abstentions.
   Yeltsin celebrated his victory today with an impromptu march
from the Kremlin up Moscow's Gorky Street. He was greeted by
well-wishers at the Kremlin's Troitsky Gate, and the crowd moved
with him across a huge square and set off up Gorky Street, one of
downtown Moscow's major avenues.
   Yeltsin picked up a crowd of 200 followers on his way up the
sidewalk. Supporters handed him pink roses and red carnations, and
shouted ``Hurrah!'' as he passed. ``We knew he was an honest
person,'' said Anna Sabalova. ``We knew he was elected by millions,
but just a few in the congress held him back.''
   Yeltsin was dismissed as Moscow Communist Party chief in 1987
after saying that Gorbachev's reforms were not proceeding fast
enough. He was given a position in the Construction Ministry. When
he won a seat in the congress, he achieved one of the most stunning
political comebacks on Soviet history.
   There was no direct vote on selecting Yeltsin to fill the seat
on the Supreme Soviet today, but the hall broke into applause after
the controversial ex-member of the ruling Polituburo was given a
legislative seat.
   Yeltsin walked out of the congress hall with Kazannik, smiling
and met a horde of reporters. He said the decision showed the
congress had fallen into line with the will of the people.
   Communist Party Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, whose
resignation Yeltsin has demanded after accusing him of impeding
reforms, told reporters the decision was ``democratic'' and
``normal.''
   During the questioning of Gorbachev's choice for vice president,
historian Roy Medvedev told applauding deputies they needed to know
more about Lukyanov before they could make him the country's No. 2
government official because policies change whenever the president
leaves the Kremlin.
   ``When Gorbachev goes on vacation or goes abroad, the whole
state policy ... changes 50, 60, or 180 percent,'' said Medvedev,
whose studies of Stalinism were banned for many years.
   Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov, a pair of anti-corruption
crusaders who have run afoul of Kremlin authorities, quizzed
Lukyanov, who already serves as vice president, on the sharp rise
in crime and his attitude toward a high-level investigation of the
two outspoken prosecutors.
   Lukyanov, a 59-year-old lawyer, originally was elected vice
president in October by the old Supreme Soviet, which was a rubber
stamp for the Kremlin leadership. He has been involved in
government efforts to rewrite the legal code but is not widely
known.
   He told the deputies that much of the rapid increase in crime
was due to the Soviet Union's poor economic condition, and said
legal reforms would make great changes.
   The constitution gives Gorbachev the right to appoint his own
vice president, subject to confirmation by the congress, and
several deputies complained that they did not have a choice.
   ``In the United States of America, they don't vote for the vice
president,'' Gorbachev told the deputies as he pressed for a
confirmation vote.

   Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms in the Soviet
Union have rekindled the hopes of three aging diplomats whose
embassies have survived in obscurity for nearly 50 years, nurtured
by symbols and the benevolence of the United States.
   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia _ the Baltic states swallowed up
by Josef Stalin in 1940 and which comprise three of the 15 Soviet
republics _ do not exist at the United Nations. They do not exist
at major international organizations. Their names sound like a
footnote of historical trivia.
   But in downtown Washington and mid-town Manhattan, three Baltic
legations hoist their flags daily, issue Baltic passports and meet
with U.S. officials.
   At the State Department, a Baltic Affairs officer conducts
business as though the Soviets had never laid claim to the three
strategically located states which declared their independence in
1918.
   The U.S. government does not recognize the forced annexation and
has always treated the three envoys, who hold the rank of charge
d'affaires, like any other diplomat, listing them in the official
State Department Diplomatic List and inviting them to all
receptions for ambassadors.
   In recent months, however, the Baltic diplomatic corps has more
to do than just attend receptions. Along with U.S. officials, they
have been meeting with a growing stream of nationalists allowed to
travel to the United States, gathering information about the
unprecedented grassroots swell of demands for greater independence.
   In what amounts to a virtual call for secession, Baltic
nationalists issued a call earlier this month for economic
independence from Moscow and adopted a platform asserting their
right to set policies and veto directives from the Kremlin.
   The Baltic representatives in the United States agree these are
the most exciting times they have known in nearly 50 years. But
they worry about Soviet reprisals.
   Ernst Jaakson has represented Estonia in the United States since
coming to San Francisco as a young consul in 1929. In 1937, he was
transferred to New York.
   Now in his 80s, Jaakson appears overwhelmed by the recent surge
of Estonians who openly visit the three-room legation office.
``Once they were afraid of the KGB. Now they come very freely, it's
very encouraging,'' he said.
   In Washington, nestled between the Ghanaian and Polish
Embassies, a yellow-green-and-red flag flutters over a stone
mansion that has housed the Lithuanian legation since the 1920s. It
is getting a $200,000 face lift in response to a revived interest
in the legation, both by Soviet and American visitors.
   Nowadays, Lithuanian visitors from the Soviet Union pose for
photos against the backdrop of the flag and some even ask to be
issued a Lithuanian passport, said Stasys Lozoraitis, the charge
d'affaires.
   Lozoraitis and his staff of four rattle around the five-story
mansion, which also serves as his home when he is not in Rome
representing Lithuania at the Vatican.
   Lozoraitis rejected a suggestion that the Baltic legations have
been kept alive by CIA funds. The three states pooled investments
they had made abroad prior to the Soviet occupation and live off
the interest, Lozoraitis and the other diplomats said.
   Lozoraitis, a courtly, soft-spoken man, has diplomacy in his
blood. His father was posted as Lithuania's ambassador to the
Vatican just days before the Soviets occupied his homeland. The
family never went back.
   His father's predecessor in Rome was deported by the Soviets to
Siberia, as were hundreds of thousands of Baltic citizens who
opposed the takeover, Lozoraitis said.
   Attracted by the ferment in the Baltic states, some 800 American
students have come in groups to the legation this year, and
Lozoraitis happily lectures them about his country and its
prospects for independence.
   ``I tell them it's ridiculous for the Soviets to keep us under
oppression, when instead we could be friendly neighbors, prosperous
trade partners, a sort of bridge to Western Europe,'' he said.
   The Baltic states are generally more prosperous than other parts
of the Soviet Union. ``We could be for Moscow what Hong Kong is for
Beijing,'' he said.
   The nearly 5 million Lithuanians have made great strides toward
that goal in the past year, Lozoraitis said. ``Our 100 steps
forward can't be undone. They can push us back 10 steps, but not
all the way.''
   The Latvians too are proud, but also cautious. ``We can't afford
to forget the lessons of history,'' said John Lusis, First
Secretary at the three-member Latvian Legation. The head of the
legation, Anatol Dinbergs, is getting on in years and Lusis speaks
for him.
   Lusis is of a newer generation of Baltic diplomats who have
never set foot in their homelands. He was born in Germany to
Latvian parents and lived in Canada before coming here.
   In the mid-1970s, the State Department recognized that
replacements would be needed for the veteran Baltic diplomats. It
agreed to grant the same diplomatic immunity and privileges to
younger representatives as long as they were of Baltic descent and
not U.S. citizens.
   Lozoraitis, Lusis and the others carry Baltic diplomatic
passports and say the travel documents are recognized by many
countries, including China. Baltic missions also exist in Canada
and England.
   But the Soviet bloc is still off limits.
   Lozoraitis hopes he can use his passport to go home one day.
``But right now, I still cannot accept going to the Russian embassy
and asking them for a visa. Instead, they should be asking me for a
visa to visit my own home.''

<HEAD>Race Between Rivals Reveals Strains in Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A parliament race between a veteran
dissident and a prominent lawyer who once defended him has turned
into a struggle for the soul of the Solidarity-led opposition
movement.
   Jacek Kuron, a founder of the Polish opposition movement, has
been endorsed by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa in Sunday's
elections, the first competitive balloting in Poland under
communist rule.
   But Kuron is being challenged in his northern Warsaw district of
Zoliborz by lawyer Wladyslaw Sila-Nowicki, who defended Kuron
during the political trials in the 1970s.
   Kuron is among the best-known of Solidarity's intellectual
advisers, some of whom began as communists in the 1950s and 1960s
but broke with the party long ago. Those advisers have provided the
movement with theoretical ammunition in its struggle to wrest
freedoms from the government.
   Sila-Nowicki's roots are in the pre-World War II Christian
Democrats, a party that had strong ties to the Roman Catholic
Church and which is now reorganizing with the tacit approval from
some bishops and priests.
   As part of accords reached with communist authorities April 5,
the opposition agreed to support partially free elections to the
Sejm and a newly created Senate in return for legalizing Solidarity
after a seven-year ban.
   The opposition is allotted only 161 seats in the 460-seat Sejm,
with the rest reserved for the communists. The 100 seats in the
newly created Senate are open to all groups, making it the first
democratically elected legislative body in the East bloc.
   With his 30-year record of opposition activity that includes
eight years in prison, Kuron was a natural choice for Solidarity to
endorse for the Sejm.
   A former communist who was sent to prison for an open letter
urging the party to reform, he helped found the Workers Defense
Committee after authorities brutally suppressed strikes in 1976.
   Sila-Nowicki, 75, also has a long record serving the opposition.
   A soldier in the underground that which resisted Nazi and later
Soviet occupation, Sila-Nowicki notes he was condemned to death
four times and imprisoned from shortly after the end of World War
II until 1956.
   In the 1970s, he was one of the few lawyers willing to defend
activists who were continually being arrested.
   Sila-Nowicki also stresses his links to Solidarity in campaign
literature. On some posters his name has been painted to resemble
the familiar red-and-white Solidarity logo.
   He notes that he served as an adviser in Gdansk in 1980, when
Walesa signed the agreements that legalized the Soviet bloc's first
free trade union. It was outlawed 18 months later after the martial
law crackdown.
   Solidarity candidates posed for photos with Walesa as a mark of
authenticity. Sila-Nowicki responded with photos showing him with
Polish-born Pope John Paul II.
   But his campaign literature fails to mention that in 1986 he was
the only well-known independent figure who joined an advisory
council set up by Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski as proof
that national reconciliation was proceeding. Others refused, saying
Solidarity first should be legalized.
   Voters, unused to being able to choose anyone but officially
approved candidates, are confused.
   ``Is he on Lech's list?'' one woman asked a Sila-Nowicki worker
at a table outside the St. Stanislaw Kostka Church, a Solidarity
stronghold. When she was told no, she said: ``Then he's not
Solidarity.''
   Sila-Nowicki is not from Zoliborz. Candidates can run where they
like, and Sila-Nowicki said he came to Zoliborz specifically to
challenge Kuron.
   ``We are presenting different visions of today's Solidarity,''
Sila-Nowicki told his first election meeting May 14.
   Sila-Nowicki accused Solidarity of not backing enough Christian
Democratic candidates and of choosing candidates without consulting
the rank and file.
   Seven Christian Democratic candidates are running nationwide,
but only one is endorsed by Solidarity. They support free markets
and the church's social teachings, such as opposition to abortion.
   ``There is a leftist direction in Solidarity. We would like to
see a Christian path,'' said Maciej Mazuriewicz, a 24-year-old
student supporter of Sila-Nowicki.
   When the two men debated on May 20, the 700 seats of the Wisla
theater were filled and hundreds more listened outside.
Sila-Nowicki received polite applause, but the crowd roared when
Kuron emerged.

   A 20-year-old East German border
guard abandoned his weapon and climbed over a steel-mesh fence to
escape to West Germany, police said Monday.
   The soldier ``waited until his supervisor was temporarily gone,
then abandoned his sub-machinegun and climbed over the steel-mesh
fence to escape,'' the Bavarian border police said.
   The escape near the Bavarian city of Coburg occurred Friday,
police said.
   Ten-foot-high chain-link fences constructed by the East Germans
separate the two German nations along their border near Coburg.
   Coburg is about 120 miles north of the Bavarian capital, Munich.

   Polish citizens around the world will be able to
vote in next weekend's historic election in Poland by going to
their nearest consulate, a prospect that has Chicago's large Polish
community skeptical but hopeful.
   ``It's time for something new. Communism hasn't worked out,''
Halina Cessna said while looking over imported sauerkraut and hams
in a Polish grocery.
   ``The most important thing is that these are the first elections
with a choice in many years,'' she said. ``At last, the opposition
has a voice.''
   The Communist government and the opposition Solidarity trade
union on April 5 agreed to Poland's first somewhat democratic
balloting since World War II.
   Polish citizens living abroad may vote Saturday at Polish
consulates. In Poland, voters will go to the polls Sunday.
   At stake are 460 seats in the existing parliament, the Sejm, and
100 seats in the newly created Senate. The opposition is allotted
161 seats in the Sejm, with the rest reserved for the communists.
But the race for the Senate is wide open.
   Chicago is said to have more residents of Polish descent than
any city outside Warsaw.
   ``We've been fighting for this for so long, now that we've got a
chance we have to go and vote,'' Katarzyna Kowalinska said as she
waited to buy sausages in a delicatessen along Milwaukee Avenue,
sometimes called the Polish Broadway.
   ``It's not really a free election, but it's a first step,'' said
Ms. Kowalinska. ``It's already a lot. There'll be a free press and
free television.''
   ``I love my country, but I'm not interested in politics,'' Marek
Stachowicz said as he sipped coffee in a tavern across the street.
``Is my vote going to make a difference? No.''
   Robert Michniewicz, vice consul at the Chicago consulate,
estimated 800,000 people in the Chicago area are of Polish descent.
He said about 50,000 are still citizens of Poland, and he expects
as many as 10,000 to vote here _ a far cry from the 200-odd he says
voted in past Polish elections, in which only candidates from the
Communist Party and its allies ran.
   ``I believe most of the people will vote for the opposition,''
Michniewicz said. ``In these elections, Solidarity is encouraging
people to vote.''
   Poles voting here and at consulates in New York and Washington
will choose from among 32 candidates running for three Senate seats
in Warsaw's central district, he said. Voters also will fill two
seats in the Sejm.
   Those wishing to vote must bring a passport, some other document
showing citizenship, or an ID and two witnesses swearing to a
person's citizenship.
   The election agreement reserving 65 percent of the seats in the
Sejm for the Communist Party and its allies has some Poles here
questioning the value of the exercise.
   ``If they want democracy they should give us the whole thing.
There's only going to be 35 percent opposition in the Sejm,'' said
a man who asked not to be identified because he is in the United
States illegally.
   The main issue is not how to vote but whether to vote at all,
said Maciej Wierzynski, who was a journalist in Poland and produces
a Polish-language TV show here.
   ``The people who are going to vote are certainly going to vote
for the opposition,'' Wierzynski said. ``Some people say the
elections are a compromise with the Communists, but my feeling is
that most people will vote.''
   Janina Domoradzka, who was granted political asylum in the
United States five years ago, said she didn't plan to vote.
   ``Nothing will change because we're too close to the Soviet
Union,'' Ms. Domoradzka said. ``The opposition isn't going to be
able to do anything. The Polish government won't let them.''
   The Chicago-based Polish-American Congress, an organization of
immigrant Poles, has raised about $200,000 nationally to support
the Solidarity candidates, said Kazimierz Lukomski, a leader of the
group.

<HEAD>Death Toll in Vietnam Storm Rises to 78</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll from tropical storm
Cecil's destructive charge through central Vietnam last week has
risen to 78, and 364 other people are reported missing, the Vietnam
News Agency said Monday.
   The agency, monitored in Bangkok, said 50 other people were
injured when the storm hit the coastal province of Quang Nam-Danang
Thursday and Friday. About 150,000 people were made homeless, it
said.
   The agency said the storm caused about $23 million in damage.
   It destroyed or damaged 23,500 houses, 150 schools and 3,000
boats, and rains submerged 49,400 acres of rice that was nearing
harvest, it said.
   The province's communications system was paralyzed, the report
said.
   President Vo Chi Cong sent a message of sympathy to the people
of the province, it said.
   Such storms annually cause major loss of life and damage in
Vietnam, which struggles to feed its fast-growing population.
   Cecil also dumped heavy rain in Thailand and Laos before
crossing late Saturday into Burma, where it weakened, Thailand's
Meteorological Department said.

<HEAD>Sinclair Lewis' Hometown Will Ignore Author's Criticism, Use His
Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAUK CENTRE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of this town whose
``incredible dullness'' bored Sinclair Lewis into writing ``Main
Street'' say it's time to set aside bad feelings toward the author
and capitalize on his fame.
   But the plans are met with skepticism by some who believe Lewis
was right when his ``Main Street'' lambasted the fictional Gopher
Prairie, Minn., a thinly disguised version of the central Minnesota
town where Lewis was born in 1885.
   ``So they want to redevelop things historically. That's what
I've always tried to do. But I never could get this town to wake up
and realize Sinclair Lewis gives them the greatest cottage industry
in the world,'' said Al Tingley, who is selling the Palmer House
Hotel he has owned for 15 years.
   ``I'd love to see Sauk Centre be all it can be,'' he said.
``That's exactly what Sinclair Lewis was trying to tell them:
Realize what you have and try to do more.
   ``But I don't think it'll work. This town never changes.''
   The feeling that the town of 3,700, about 95 miles northwest of
Minneapolis, has not taken advantage of Lewis' legacy moved
business owners and local officials to ask for help from Charlie
Nelson, an architect from the Minnesota Historical Society.
   Nelson looked at the hodgepodge of signs, aluminum siding and
bland paint and described the town as ``a mess of plastic and
kitsch.''
   ``They've got some pretty well-preserved buildings behind all
that tin and plastic,'' Nelson said. ``But downtown is kind of a
void. It's too easy to get out of there without knowing you've ever
been there.''
   Nelson told his hosts they should use paint, awnings and elbow
grease to bring their downtown buildings back to something
resembling their original appearance and make the place more
inviting and evocative.
   Mayor Bob Polipnick said the city should ``use Lewis as much as
we can.''
   ``I don't really care if what he said was positive or negative,
as long as people remember Sauk Centre,'' he said.
   Often pitiless about his town, Lewis railed against ``the
incredible dullness of it,'' ``its vacuousness and bad manners and
spiteful gossip.'' In the 1920 novel ``Main Street,'' when heroine
Carol Kennicott arrived in the fictional Gopher Prairie she found
``no dignity in it nor any hope of greatness. It was not a place to
live in, not possibly, not conceivably.''
   Among Lewis' other novels are ``Babbitt,'' ``Elmer Gantry,''
``Arrowsmith'' and ``It Can't Happen Here.'' In 1930, he became the
first American to win the Nobel Prize in literature. He died in
1951.
   Dave Simpkins, who publishes the newspaper where Lewis once
worked, said the revitalization push doesn't mean someone is
``trying to come in and tell people what they ought to do _ that's
what Carol Kennicott tried.''
   If enough business owners go along, he said, ``we can give the
tourists something unique so someone from Omaha will want to
come.'' The town is conveniently situated along Interstate 94,
between Minneapolis and Fargo, N.D.
   Carol Frumkin hopes to be the person to turn the hotel _ and
maybe the town _ around. Frumkin, returning to Sauk Centre 23 years
after she left, has the capital needed to make the Palmer House a
luxury hotel.
   She and her husband are moving to a farm outside town this
summer, bringing their wood products import business from
California. She pledges to turn the Palmer House into ``a small,
elegant, comfortable hotel, with a fine restaurant. We'll refurbish
everything.''
   But ``if you just have the Palmer House, it's nothing,'' Frumkin
said. ``People don't want to come here and just sit in the hotel.
The rest of downtown has to be interesting, too.''

   Bombs exploded early Monday at buildings
owned by the Italian chemical group Montedison and at the
headquarters of Shell Italia, causing damage but no injuries.
   Other early morning blasts at Selm near Milan and at Cengio near
Savona damaged pylons for high tension electric lines that served
Montedison plants, officials said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the blasts, which caused
damage that Montedison officials estimated at $1 million.
   Shell spokesman Gian Luca Chiavari said the company received no
warning before the blast that shattered a window and caused minor
damage to a conference room.
   In 1987, Shell established a joint venture with Montedison, the
other bombing target, for gasoline distribution to retail stations,
he said.
   The first bomb exploded at 2:30 a.m. near the side entrance of
Montedison's headquarters in Milan, breaking windows and damaging a
wall and cars that were parked nearby.
   About the same time, a bomb caused a fire that destroyed two
transformers at a Montedison plant near Rho in Milan Province.
   At 5 a.m., bombs damaged pylons for high tension electric lines
carrying power to plants at Selm and Cengio.
   Chiavari said the bomb exploded about 2:30 a.m. outside the
headquarters of Shell Italia.

   Sandra Botelho and Christina Monteiro
lived parallel lives, growing up in this city's Brickenwood housing
project surrounded by toddlers, lines of fresh laundry and hard
drugs.
   Their side-by-side lives may also have taken them into the path
of a serial killer. Botelho's body was one of nine found along
several highways near this historic port city since last July.
Monteiro is one of two women missing and believed dead.
   There have been no arrests despite an extensive police
investigation.
   Like most of the killer or killers' targets, Botelho and
Monteiro sold their bodies at $20 a shot and bought heroin with the
cash.
   Sitting around a dinner table, Monteiro's brothers and sisters
threw out easy memories of their sister, who loved swimming, family
picnics and dancing to rhythm and blues.
   Shirley Monteiro took down from shelves framed photographs of
first communions and her daughter, who would now be 21, grinning
wide at her baby shower three years ago.
   But Monteiro, like 25-year-old Botelho, got caught in a web of
drugs.
   ``They were good friends,'' said Deborah Botelho, Sandra's
sister. ``They shared clothes together, went dancing together and
shot up together.''
   Botelho had spent 10 years with a man relatives say was abusive.
But in the last months of her life she still struggled to get a
high school equivalency diploma, and entertained thoughts of
becoming a secretary.
   Her sister said she even thought about becoming ``a cop _ if you
can believe that.''
   She kept ending up back on the streets.
   Still, friends and family say, Sandra Botelho's two sons, age 5
and 7, always had clean clothes and food.
   ``It's hard to stay up all night doing drugs and be up cooking
eggs for the kids in the morning, but she did it,'' said Deborah
Botelho.
   Commitment to family runs deep at the Brickenwood project, one
of several developments on the city's north end, which is home to
mostly Roman Catholic families, predominantly of Portuguese and
Cape Verdian descent.
   Shirley Monteiro, who now is caring for her 3-year-old grandson,
said her daughter moved out when she was about 17.
   ``That's when I started seeing the tracks on her arms,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Monteiro decided to take action when she learned her
daughter had moved to prostitution.
   ``I was very bold,'' she said. ``I barged right in on her
apartment one time when a few guys were there and kicked the bed,
rolled over the mattress and started throwing pillows. But it still
didn't help.''
   Neither did Deborah Botelho's efforts save her sister.
   ``Sandy was calling around and looking into rehab centers,'' she
said. ``I said I'd take her kids if she followed through on it, but
I wasn't going to be a sucker at home while she was out on the
streets doing drugs.''
   The last time Deborah Botelho, 23, saw her sister was at a
cookout last August.
   ``Sandy and I always had a ball. And that night was no
different,'' Botelho said. ``She talked more about drugs and where
she was getting them, but she was still the same old Sandy.''
   The following week, Sandy was gone. Her body was found in April.
   That same August night while the Botelhos were barbecuing, the
Monteiros gathered next door on their front porch, eating ice
cream, talking, wondering where Christina might be. She had been
missing since June.
   The month before Christina disappeared, she wrote a Mother's Day
poem in neat, slanting script on paper now frayed from rereading.
She wrote of her pain, fear and desire to ``straighten out'' and
make her mother proud.
   Some relatives hold out hope she simply moved away to get a
fresh start. Investigators say it is more likely that her fate was
similar to that of her friend Sandy.

   Jeanette Coakley waited 22{ years for the
grim news she calls her best Mother's Day gift ever: the
reassurance that her son died instantly when his jet crashed in
Vietnam.
   ``Oh, what a relief,'' said Mrs. Coakley, 84. ``I just felt I
might die and never know. Now I have that.''
   The long-missing remains of Navy Lt. Cmdr. William F. Coakley
were to be buried Tuesday with full military honors in a cemetery
near the house his father and grandfather built a half-century ago.
The funeral should also bury the fears of the family that for two
decades did not know the pilot's fate.
   Mrs. Coakley, wearing the pin that designates her a Gold Star
mother, said she learned of her oldest son's fate just before
Mother's Day. The remains were among 17 sets that the Defense
Department has positively identified since the Vietnamese
government turned them over five months ago.
   ``I just had such tremendous faith that God would answer my
prayers,'' she said last week seated in her living room below a
photograph of her son with former President Lyndon Johnson and his
wife, Lady Bird.
   Coakley was 33 and on his 44th combat mission when his Skyhawk
jet went down on Sept. 13, 1966, over the North Vietnam province of
Thanh Hoa. His death came only six weeks after his youngest brother
was hit and killed by a drunken driver in their hometown.
   Handsome and smart, Coakley graduated No. 1 in his class at a
private Jesuit high school in 1953, reaped honors at Holy Cross
College and was sent by the Navy to earn a master's degree in
political affairs at Harvard University, according to his younger
brother, Robert, now 51.
   ``He had the world the way you'd want it,'' said Robert, who
heads the guidance department at the local high school.
   As a Navy social aide, Coakley escorted actresses and socialites
at White House parties from 1963 to 1965, but gave up his
prestigious job to go to Vietnam.
   ``He felt it wasn't right that he was in the White House and his
friends were out there fighting,'' his mother said.
   Coakley returned to Vietnam after his brother's death although
he could have stayed home on compassionate leave. He would have
been back in Lenox in another three months and had decided to go to
medical school.
   ``He knew what he was facing when he went back to Vietnam
because they were facing terrible, terrible odds up there,'' saids
Robert Coakley. ``The Navy was very shorthanded with pilots.''
   He said the Navy never learned what caused the jet to go down.
Another pilot noticed it was off course and radioed to Coakley to
straighten out. ``The last thing he said was, `I'm trying,''' his
brother said.
   He called the next two decades a nightmare. ``The terrible
uncertainty, the lingering despair of not knowing, are feelings I
cannot accurately describe,'' he said in a speech five years ago.
   The uncertainty vanished with a forensic report from Navy
officials last week. ``It's amazing what they can tell,'' said
Coakley, who said he did not want to go into details to spare his
mother's feelings.
   ``The most comforting things to us were that No. 1, there's no
question it was Bill, and secondly, he died instantly.''

   Jim Wright's daring call for a tax increase
the day he became speaker of the House foretold a single-minded
style of confronting issues that marked both the doing and the
undoing of his 2{-year command.
   The rent in the House Democratic leadership that began with a
yearlong ethics investigation of Wright has unraveled into the
ranks with the weekend resignation of Rep. Tony Coelho _ No. 3 in
the pecking order _ and the jockeying for party power and position
that will follow the elevation of Majority Leader Tom Foley to
speaker.
   Wright, who is expected to resign this week, helped make the
100th Congress one of the most productive in years, with the
passage of major legislation on trade, welfare reform, fighting
drugs, a bipartisan budget agreement, and dozens of other important
items.
   But in the doing of that, Wright generated searing, personal
enmity among his Republican opponents without picking up a
counterbalancing loyalty from his Democratic colleagues.
   The combination left the Texas Democrat _ a veteran of 34 years
in the House _ too thinly protected when the attack came on his
personal financial ethics.
   Democrat Rep. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota summed up the Wright
legacy in two sentences: ``The legislative record in his short term
as speaker is an exceptional record. But the price for doing that
was extraordinarily high.''
   Fellow Democrat Rep. Charles Schumer of New York elaborated:
``Jim Wright was the quintessential go-it-alone guy. And that
accounted for his success and that accounted for his failures. When
he made up his mind to do something, he got it done ... but the
House isn't structured for that kind of thing.''
   Wright never won the tax increase that he contended _ as many
members still do privately _ was the only way the federal deficit
will be reduced substantially. His willingness to take hits to win
battles met with some notable success.
   When it became clear that the Reagan administration could no
longer muster support for its policy of arming the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels, Wright seized the initiative. He led negotiations
himself that resulted in new, non-lethal, ``humanitarian'' aid
packages for the rebels coupled with support of regional efforts to
work out a peace settlement.
   While the trail Wright blazed has essentially become U.S.
policy, he suffered intense criticism for trampling on prerogatives
usually reserved by the president.
   Maybe there simply was too much success for Wright's own good,
suggested Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a member of the speaker's
leadership team and a potential successor to Coelho.
   ``I think the leadership on our side was so successful that we
really posed a tremendous threat to the Republicans, and I think
because of that they decided that they needed to weaken the
leadership and they went after the speaker,'' he said.
   Dorgan said Wright would not tolerate the legislative foot
dragging that was the hallmark of Congress for years. ``That means
you step on some toes, and maybe run over some egos,'' said Dorgan.
``He didn't make a lot of friends.''
   Some of those toes and egos belonged to Democrats, who mostly
kept their gripes within the Democratic family _ but who were not
exactly eager to rush to Wright's public defense.
   Embittered Republicans, on the other hand, complained _ loudly _
that Wright's successes were won with strong-armed parliamentary
tactics that dictated the results and demeaned the institution of
the House.
   The defining confrontation came early in Wright's speakership.
   With budget talks with the Reagan White House just underway in
October, 1987, Wright insisted on going ahead with a Democratic
grab-bag bill of budget and tax items. Republicans rounded up the
votes to block it, and thought they had a rare victory.
   But an impatient Wright didn't let them savor their success. He
adjourned the House, declared a new legislative day _ a
parliamentary maneuver to leap to a new calendar day _ and muscled
the bill to passage by forcing a Texas colleague to change his vote.
   ``The speaker had a luncheon with the Republicans, and we tried
to patch things up,'' Bonior recalled.
   But Wright was the not the back-slapping, chummy guy who could
smooth over legislative brawls with his personality.
   ``It's clear that he doesn't have the same warm, effusive
personality that Tip (former speaker Thomas P. O'Neill) did. Jim
was a little more aloof than that, and a little more alone than
that,'' Dorgan said.
   Rep. Dick Cheney, a GOP leader who is now secretary of defense,
praised Wright at a dinner a few days before that pivotal budget
vote. Afterward, Cheney rarely had a kind word for the speaker and
helped file the ethics complaint that lined up the nails for
Wright's political coffin.
   Despite his bad relations with the Republicans, Wright was able
to push through all 13 of Congress' annual spending bills last year
_ the first time that had been accomplished in many years.
   But the 101st Congress began in January on a bad note for Wright.
   Already mired in controversy because of questions raised about
his ethics, Wright lost points with members of both parties with
his handling _ many of his colleagues termed it mishandling _ of
President Bush's recommendation that Congress receive a 50 percent
pay increase.
   Although he personally opposed such a big salary boost, Wright
tried to find a way to get it through for his colleagues.
Eventually, he backed down to supporting a 30 percent increase, and
the whole thing finally collapsed. Congress not only did not get
the pay raise, but took a bruising from the public.
   In typical style, Wright acted almost alone, absorbing most of
the criticism. Republican campaign officials helped fan the flames
of public outrage at Wright even though it was Bush's pay proposal.
   Republicans were angered by the Democratic Senate's rejection of
John Tower, Bush's first choice for defense secretary. And with the
legislative pace slowed in part because of a slow-moving new
administration, the spotlight locked on Wright's ethics.
   In a scenario that had all the earmarks of Wright's final days
as speaker, he tried last week to find a graceful exit. He
dispatched lawyers to see if the House ethics committee might
consider dropping some charges against him in return for his
stepping down.
   But the ethics committee is the one committee in the House where
Republicans have an equal vote with the Democrats, and they
publicly decried any ``deal-making.''
   The embittered Republicans wouldn't help their nemesis leave.
Democrats didn't rally to his defense, instead talking about an
orderly transition.
   And the speaker again was left to act on his own.
   If there was doubt he would step down, it was lessened by
Coelho's surprise resignation _ a move the California Democrat said
in part was intended to spare the party further turmoil stemming
from an almost certain protracted examination of his own ethics in
connection with his involvement in a junk bond purchase.
   Without saying so directly, Coelho was saying indirectly that if
he would step aside for the good of the party, so could anyone else.

   Gunmen attacked a United Nations convoy
carrying emergency food from Uganda to war-torn southern Sudan,
killing three people and seriously injuring one, a U.N official
said Monday.
   The nationality of the dead and injured were not known, but they
were not U.N. employees, said Diane Weathers, a spokeswoman for the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Nairobi. The time of the
attack was not known.
   The incident, the third of its kind, prompted U.N. officials to
postpone emergency food deliveries by road, but airlifts will
continue from Entebbe, Uganda, to Juba in southern Sudan, Ms.
Weathers said.
   The 20-truck convoy, carrying 270 tons of corn, was attacked
shortly after crossing the border from northwestern Uganda. The
convoy reported the attack Monday upon reaching its destination in
Yei, in Sudan's southeastern Equatoria province, Ms. Weathers said.
   One truck was destroyed by a land mine but it wasn't clear
whether the explosion and the attack occurred simultaneously, she
said.
   Further details of the attack by unidentified gunmen were not
immediately available.
   On Sunday, the first train carrying emergency supplies reached
its destination in southern Sudan town of Aweil, according to
Sudan's Transport Minister Fadlallah Burma Nasser. The train was
delayed for four days by armed bandits and broken rails, government
and relief officials said.
   The $130 million U.N.-sponsored relief operation began April 1
to stockpile 115,500 tons of food in southern Sudan before the
annual heavy rains turn roads and airstrips into mud. That would be
enough food to save 100,000 Sudanese from starving.
   Last year, as many as 500,000 Sudanese died in a famine provoked
in part by the 6-year-old civil war.
   The food is being ferried from neighboring Uganda, Kenya and
northern Sudan to be distributed equally in areas held by the
government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   In 1983, the rebel army began fighting the Moslem government in
Khartoum. The rebels demand greater autonomy for the mainly
Christian and animist south.
   The rebels are observing a month's unilateral cease-fire to
permit emergency food and other supplies to reach southern Sudan.
   Even so, the U.N.-sponsored program has faced difficulties such
as the attacks by unidentified gunmen and a railroad strike. In
addition, Ethiopia has not permitted the relief program to truck
food on roads along that country's western border with Sudan.
   On May 21, 100 unidentified gunmen attacked the 48-car train
carrying 1,500 tons of food, and robbed three Western relief
officials of their personal belongings.
   In April, unidentified gunmen ambushed the first 47-truck convoy
from Kapoeta in southern Sudan, killing seven people.

   West European leaders on Monday hailed
U.S. proposals for cuts in Soviet and American troops and weapons
in Europe, temporarily shelving their quarrels over short-range
nuclear missiles.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared that President
Bush had ``transformed the summit'' of the leaders of the 16-nation
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   She cautioned, though, that an era of risk and vulnerability lay
ahead for the West if the cutbacks in conventional, or non-nuclear,
forces were carried out.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mrs. Thatcher's main
European antagonist in the nuclear dispute, applauded the United
States for ``a great initiative.''
   ``President Bush has today paved the way for further success of
our alliance,'' said Kohl. ``I congratulate him on this far-sighted
step with which he has once more impressively affirmed the United
States' leadership.''
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass reported the Bush plan,
adding that ``local observers note that the new proposals were made
by Washington after the Bush administration came under serious
criticism from the public for the lack of any disarmament
initiatives at a time when the Soviet Union has launched a `peace
offensive.'''
   At the summit's opening session, Bush proposed a joint reduction
in U.S. and Soviet troops stationed in Europe to 275,000 for each
side by 1993. He also urged sharp slashes in conventional weapons,
including tanks, and their destruction.
   He called on the allies to indicate their willingness to
negotiate limits on combat aircraft and helicopters in Europe to 15
percent below current NATO levels. All the removed equipment would
be destroyed.
   U.S. officials were delighted with the allies' reaction.
   A senior administration official, briefing reporters on
condition of anonymity, said the atmosphere as Bush unveiled his
initiative in a closed session of the Western alliance leaders was
``enthusiastic _ even warmer than anything we had reason to
expect.''
   Dutch, Spanish and Italian officials welcomed the move.
   Hubert Vedrine, a spokesman for French President Francois
Mitterrand, said France supports the Bush proposals but expressed
reservations about including aircraft in the conventional arms
bargaining.
   He said France's air forces cannot be included in the
negotiations because they contribute to the nation's independent
nuclear strategy. France is not a member of NATO's military
structure.
   The United States wants the NATO leaders to endorse Bush's plan
so that it can be put on the negotiating table at recently opened
talks in Vienna with the Warsaw Pact on reducing conventional
forces in Europe.
   The move at the start of a two-day summit took the spotlight off
what had promised to be a difficult meeting of the 16 allies,
marking NATO's 40th anniversary.
   The United States and Britain are leading the opposition to West
German demands for negotiations to reduce short-range nuclear
missiles.
   However, a cutback in conventional armaments _ where the Soviets
now have huge superiority _ would fulfill a U.S. condition for
entering short-range negotiations.
   Mrs. Thatcher, her spokesman reported, told the summit in closed
session that Bush's initiative ``went to the heart of the
superiority of the Soviet Union in conventional weapons.''
   But she said the Bush proposals, if accepted by Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, ``would take a very considerable time to
achieve.''
   The British spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said Mrs.
Thatcher added that the ``interim period would therefore be a time
of vulnerability and risk'' making it essential for NATO to have
``a sufficiency of short-range nuclear forces.''
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said Bush had given
``the Soviets an opportunity to show they are able and ready to
reduce their forces.''
   Van den Broek and several other European officials warned of
immediate difficulties for negotiators in agreeing on reductions in
helicopters and combat aircraft because of differing methods of
counting warplanes by the superpowers.
   Spanish Foreign Minister Franciso Fernandez Ordonez said Bush
had given a new impetus to the conventional arms talks.
   ``This proposal would reduce the possibility of a surprise
attack by the Warsaw Pact,'' he said, adding it enhanced the
chances of the NATO allies ``reaching a good agreement'' among
themselves in Brussels.
   Bush also pleased some regular critics. John Isaacs, spokesman
for a Washington-based anti-nuclear group, Council for a Livable
World, said arms control took ``two to tango.''
   ``We've had for the last couple of years Gorbachev quite willing
to tango ... he may have a partner in President Bush and NATO.''

   The towering ``Goddess of Democracy'' displayed
in Tiananmen Square by freedom-seeking Chinese students is sister
to the Statue of Liberty and dramatically highlights the influence
U.S. ideals have had on the protesters.
   ``At first we wanted to make it exactly like the Statue of
Liberty,'' said Ke Feng, a Beijing University student involved in
construction of the 33-foot styrofoam and plaster of Paris
monument. ``China needs this type of symbol.''
   The statue was being assembled at Tiananmen for unveiling
Tuesday.
   The Goddess of Democracy, feverishly built by Central Fine Arts
Academy student sculptors, differs slightly in design from the
152-foot copper statue in New York Harbor. Both depict a woman in
classical robes holding high a torch of freedom, although the
Chinese version does not hold a tablet.
   It is not the first time that U.S. influence on the protests for
democratic change has surfaced. Replicas of the Statue of Liberty
have been carried by marchers in Shanghai several times and have
appeared on campus posters in Beijing.
   ``America represents democracy and freedom,'' said Wang Yue, a
23-year-old senior at the Beijing Science and Technology
University, one of the students who gathered Monday night in
Tiananmen Square. ``I think most of the students received the idea
of democracy and freedom from America and other Western countries.''
   Information about the United States has become widely available
since China opened to the outside world a decade ago, and students
say they study U.S. history at school.
   More than 60,000 Chinese have gone to the United States to study
since 1978, and some of those who have come back participated in
the pro-democracy protests of the past six weeks.
   An English-language poster in Beijing recalled Patrick Henry's
immortal line, ``Give me liberty or give me death.'' Others have
quoted Nathan Hale and the Declaration of Independence.
   ``Of the people, by the people, for the people. This should be a
universal principle,'' a Petroleum University senior at Tiananmen
Square said Monday, recalling Abraham Lincoln's prescription for
good government in the Gettysburg Address.
   The student demonstrators, while not calling for the end of
Communist Party rule, clearly support U.S. political ideals such as
freedom of the press and the rule of law.
   ``We want our government to be more like America's,'' said one
student visiting Beijing from the northeastern industrial city of
Shenyang.
   Pro-democracy protesters are eager that their movement be viewed
positively in the United States and incessantly ask reporters about
the reaction of the Bush administration and Americans to the
demonstrations.
   The Chinese people have turned to the United States for
inspiration before when seeking political change.
   John Dewey, an American philosopher known for his pragmatism,
profoundly influenced some leaders of the May Fourth Movement of
1919, when students protested to demand democracy and science.
   Even communist revolutionary Mao Tse-tung is said to have been
impressed by George Washington and the American Revolution.
   The 1989 democracy protesters, however, view neither the United
States nor the Western world as the sole source of inspiration.
   Chinese students have followed with interest Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness, that
has eased press restrictions and allowed public political debate.
   The communist neighbors share recent histories of autocratic
government, and Gorbachev's political reforms are viewed by some
Chinese students as models for change in their own country.
   When the Soviet leader visited China from May 15-18, during the
height of the protests, several students carried welcoming signs in
Chinese and Russian. ``Welcome to a Real Reformer, Gorbachev,'' one
read. ``Democracy _ Our Common Ideal,'' said another.
   But when a group of students was asked Monday whether they
considered the United States or the Soviet Union a better model for
political change, they answered with a chorus, ``You can't put the
question like that.''
   They said neither system was suitable as a comprehensive model
for a new political system in China, which will have to travel its
own road to democracy.

<HEAD>Government Says Army Repels Offensive at Jalalabad</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government reported a new
offensive around Jalalabad, which Moslem guerrillas have had under
siege since early March, but said Monday its soldiers repulsed the
insurgents with artillery fire.
   Mohammad Nabi Amani, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said at
least 139 guerrillas had been killed and 70 wounded since the
attack began Sunday. He did not give government casualties.
   Guerrillas based in neighboring Pakistan said the they began a
new attack Saturday on government posts around Jalalabad, 75 miles
east of Kabul. They claimed to have captured several posts and
killed or wounded 70 soldiers.
   Neither claim could be verified. Each side generally exaggerates
the other's casualties.
   Amani said insurgents fired rockets and artillery at the city
and airport, but the armed forces responded quickly.
   Jalalabad was the first major guerrilla target after Soviet
military forces completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan on Feb.
15, ending nine years of involvement in the civil war. When the
attack began nearly three months ago, some guerrilla commanders
predicted the city would fall within days.
   Capturing Jalalabad, about 45 miles from the border with
Pakistan, would give the insurgents a base for the interim
government they formed in February.
   Amani said about 18,000 soldiers had been deployed around
Jalalabad to fight an estimated 22,000 rebels surrounding the city.
   Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who leads the fundamentalist Hezb-e-Islami
guerrilla group, said Monday in Pakistan the war would continue
until the Marxist government in Kabul falls.
   Addressing a news conference in Islamabad, Hekmatyar said his
followers would not accept a political solution involving King
Zahir Shah, who was overthrown in 1973 and lives in exile in Italy.
   In Kabul, Amani said insurgents fired rockets Sunday into Khost,
southern Afghanista, killing two civilians. He claimed 30
guerrillas were killed and 20 wounded.
   He said rockets killed three civilians in Kandahar and gave
guerrilla casualties there as seven killed and five wounded.
   Amani reported a civilian wounded in Herat, western Afghanistan,
and three insurgents killed in Konduz, a northern province.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White men give and get the majority of transplant
organs in the United States, a disparity that many experts fear
could thwart efforts to boost organ donation, especially among
minorities.
   ``The bottom line is that there is a racial difference and the
gap isn't closing,'' said Dr. Paul Eggers, chief of the federal
Health Care Financing Administration's program evaluation branch in
the office of research.
   Transplant doctors will be looking at ways to provide greater
access to the costly surgery at their annual meeting this week in
Chicago. They also will be discussing ways to get more Americans,
across the board, to donate loved ones' organs.
   ``Anybody can get on the (waiting) list, but they have to get to
the transplant center,'' said Dr. Barry Levin, president of the
American Society of Transplant Physicians. ``They themselves have
to want to be transplanted. Physicians have to refer them.''
   That's precisely the problem for many women, blacks and other
minorities and lower-income individuals, according to Arthur
Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the
University of Minnesota.
   ``If Americans don't all have an equal chance at access to a
primary care doctor, forget about a transplant surgeon,'' Caplan
said.
   Statistics just released by the Virginia-based United Network
for Organ Sharing, which administers the national transplant
network and scientific registry, show 83.2 percent of the 4,083
brain-dead victims whose organs were donated in 1988 were white.
About 8.6 percent were black and 5.9 percent were Hispanic, well
below their population share.
   On the opposite end, whites received 88.9 percent of hearts
transplanted last year, 85.9 percent of livers, 71 percent of
kidneys and 97.6 percent of pancreases.
   Sixty-two percent of the 1988 donors were male. Men also
dominated on the receiving side, getting 79.2 percent of hearts
transplanted last year, 60.6 percent of kidneys and 56.4 percent of
pancreases. Liver transplant recipients were almost evenly divided
between males and females, however.
   The group excluded from its calculations recipients whose race
or sex were not reported.
   While such lopsidedness does not prove bias exists, because for
example men and women have different rates of some types of
diseases, it certainlysuggests it, and that alone ``poses a grave
threat to organ donation,'' according to Caplan.
   The fact that blacks received 21.7 percent of the kidneys
transplanted in 1988 is particularly worrisome, experts say, since
blacks are four times as likely as whites to suffer kidney failure.
That's due, in large part, to blacks' proclivity toward high blood
pressure.
   One-third of the 107,000 Americans on dialysis are black. And
one-third of the nearly 15,000 people awaiting kidney transplants
in the United States are black, said Dr. William Vaughn, the
network's director of technical services.
   Both dialysis and kidney transplantation are covered under the
federal Medicare program regardless of the person's age.
   A study by Dr. Philip Held, researcher at the Urban Institute in
Washington, found wealthy white men were likelier to get a new
kidney from 1981 to 1986 than poor white men. The same held true
for black men: The higher the income, the likelier a transplant.
   ``I think that if there were outcomes that weren't expected,
they were ones of ignorance and not evil intent,'' Held said.
   Experts insist the present selection system is sex- and
colorblind. The nation's more than 240 transplant centers have been
required, since Oct. 1, 1987, to use standardized scoring for
allocating organs, judging each patient on such things as severity
and length of illness and blood and tissue type.
   The emphasis on tissue matching for kidneys is hotly contested
among transplant specialists. Proponents say the practice improves
the patient's chances, while critics contend the gains are not
great enough to warrant having organs lie around and deteriorate
until a close match is found. Opponents also contend
tissue-matching discriminates against blacks, because a minority of
blacks have tissue-matching problems that make them face a longer
wait for kidneys.
   Those kinds of odds don't make it any easier convincing blacks
to pursue transplants, according to Howard University's Dr. Clive
O. Callender, one of the nation's few black transplant surgeons.
   ``The black patient often is not comfortable (with
transplantation) for the same reasons blacks are disinclined to
donate organs,'' he said.
   Those reasons, according to Callender, include religious
beliefs, lack of transplant awareness, and distrust of the
white-dominated medical community.
   Another factor, he says, is that some blacks want their
relatives' organs to go to other blacks, a request that, like any
other, cannot be assured.

<HEAD>Nuclear Sub Has Reactor Accident 16 Years Ago, Researchers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy denied trying to cover up a mishap
involving a nuclear submarine's reactor, although the ship's logs
make no mention of the incident 16 years ago, private researchers
said Monday.
   ``The U.S. Navy claims that it has never had a nuclear
propulsion accident,'' Joshua Handler said of the incident. ``But
their own documents show how misleading they've been.''
   The Navy denied it had ever tried to cover up news of the
accident, describing it as a minor mishap in which ``there were no
serious injuries or radiological problems, the ship remained fully
capable to perform any mission required of it and there was no
damage to the reactor.''
   The service acknowledged, however, that the incident had never
been publicized, and spokesmen were unable to say why the sub's
deck logs and official command history made no mention of it.
   ``The Navy had a major nuclear accident and then lied about
it,'' asserted William Arkin, a researcher with the Institute for
Policy Studies, a liberal Washington think tank. ``We caught them
with their bellbottoms down.''
   Arkin and Handler, a researcher who heads the Greenpeace
environmental group's Nuclear Free Seas Campaign, released their
findings Monday. The Institute for Policy Studies and Greenpeace
are about to publish a study of serious naval accidents around the
world.
   ``According to the deck logs of the USS Guardfish for April 21,
1973, which we obtained, the submarine was `Underway submerged as
before' for the entire day, without incident,'' Arkin said.
   ``In fact, the submarine suffered a primary coolant leak ... and
then surfaced, ventilated, decontaminated and repaired its reactor
unassisted. Five crewmen were later sent to the Puget Sound, Wash.,
Naval Hospital for radiation monitoring.''
   Willis S. Rich, the sub's skipper at the time and now a
professor of engineering at Boston University, said in an interview
about the report that had he noticed there was nothing in the log
about the accident, he would have told the navigator to add the
information.
   ``It was a minor mishap,'' he said. ``Nobody was injured. But it
was a primary coolant leak and you can't take that lightly.''
   Earlier this month, the two researchers disclosed new details
about the loss of a hydrogen bomb off the coast of Japan in 1965.
   Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a Navy spokesman, responded: ``We did
not try to cover anything up. Everything about this incident was
properly reported through Navy channels.
   ``Now, it's true we don't issue a press release every time
something breaks down. That depends, for example, on whether there
is a hazard to people, a hazard to the environment or danger to the
public.''
   Quigley said he had not seen the deck logs obtained by Arkin and
Handler under the Freedom of Information Act and would not
speculate on why they made no mention of a mishap.
   He did, however, release a statement outlining exactly what
happened that day 16 years ago aboard the Guardfish, a Permit-class
attack submarine that is still in service and based at San Diego,
Calif.
   ``While transiting from Pearl Harbor to Bangor (Wash.), a
crewman was performing a tightness check of a small valve and
inadvertently set up a path that allowed for a minor loss of
primary coolant (water) through a test fitting opening of
one-quarter inch in diameter,'' the statement said.
   ``Within about 10 minutes, the ship stopped the leak. The
estimated amount of coolant released was less than five gallons.''
   In such cases, ``it is standard practice for a submarine to
surface ... in order to ventilate the spaces overboard'' and the
Guardfish did just that, the statement continued.
   Five sailors were subsequently found ``to have low levels of
radioactivity on their skin from the leak.''
   ``Each crewman had the radioactivity removed by washing with
soap and water. The maximum radiation exposure ... was similar to
what he would have received in getting a common chest X-ray.
   ``When the ship reached Bangor, these five crewmen were
monitored for internally deposited radioactivity. ... The results
showed that none of the crewmen involved had ingested any
detectable radioactivity.''
   Rich, who retired as a captain, said he was not surprised the
deck logs made no mention of the incident ``because deck logs for a
submarine are a general synopsis at a lower classification, whereas
the quartermaster's notebook and patrol report would be more
definitive and classified.''

   Choppers whir overhead, sharpshooters
eye the roads, a bomb squad is on standby and Buddhist monks are
beating the drum for peace. It's summit time again in Brussels.
   Residents have seen it all before and hardly raise an eyebrow to
what has become a routine of pomp, protection and protest.
   But with the leaders of the 16 nations of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization collected in a single building, security
officials are ever-vigilant.
   At least once a year, this capital of 1 million people also
hosts a top meeting for the heads of the 12-nation European
Economic Community trade bloc. Not surprisingly, people no longer
line the streets for a fleeting glimpse of world politics.
   ``For Belgium, there is a certain routine now,'' said a foreign
affairs official, who asked not to be named. ``Many summits have
identical procedures.''
   For weeks now the different police forces, the army and the
embassies of attending nations have had coordination meetings at
the interior ministry to pave the way for a safe summit.
   ``Nothing is left to chance,'' said a Brussels police official,
who also demanded anonymity. ``Holidays are suspended; everybody is
mobilized.''
   On Monday morning, security was at its tightest at the NATO
complex when a steady stream of black and gray limousines,
accompanied by hundreds of police motorcycles, swept through the
morning rush hour to deliver their guests for the first session.
   As President Bush arrived, sharpshooters stood on the roof of
the sprawling NATO complex next to men using binoculars to spot any
sign of trouble. For safe measure, a helicopter passed overhead.
   Within the barracks-like compound, hundreds of police and army
officials were posted along the different roads leading to the
meeting rooms and a bomb disposal squad was discreetly stationed
outside the main building.
   Journalists entered through a special side entrance equipped
with metal detecters. All equipment was checked before the
reporters got close to the headquarters.
   Outside, security forces kept watch on a peace demonstration of
a dozen Japanese Buddhist monks, who prayed and beat drums almost
throughout the morning, discreetly across the street.
   The security operation spans most of Brussels, from NATO
headquarters in suburban Brussels to the international airport on
the outskirts.
   Security also was tight at the 18th century Chateau Stuyvenberg,
where Bush is staying on the outskirts of Brussels. The president
was accompanied by three Secret Service agents when he went jogging
on the grounds for 20 minutes during an evening break.
   Leading up to the summit, bomb-sniffing dogs checked the
dignitaries' travel routes and accommodations. Several temporary
walls were even built to protect high-profile visitors such as Bush.
   At the coordination meetings, cooperation between local police
and security staff of attending nations had to be smoothed out to
avoid embarrassing scuffles between officials trying to protect the
same people, officials said.
   During the summit, well over 1,300 police and state police
worked round-the-clock.
   ``Obviously, it all costs a lot of money,'' said Frank De Mot of
the interior ministry. He and other officials said they were unable
to estimate the total expense.
   Hosting summits ``has disadvantages but also advantages,'' said
De Mot to explain Belgium's policy. It gives Brussels prestige and
provides the tourist industry with considerable income during the
summit.
   A summit also allows the police services to bask in the light of
global publicity and the competition is tough for the privilege to
escort leaders such as Bush or French President Francois Mitterrand.
   ``We really have to be diplomatic to resolve'' such quarrels,
said one official.
   Escorting the world leaders around Brussels ``is something that
you can always tell your children and grandchildren about,'' said
U.S. Embassy spokesman Jim Findlay.

<HEAD>Government-Industrial Partnership Divided Over Issue Of Public Funding</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders in high tech manufacturing are full of
praise for Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher's endorsement of a
new industry-government partnership to improve American
competitiveness.
   But, they acknowledge, tongue in cheek, ``minor'' differences
over one point: money.
   The industrial officials say that, like Mosbacher, they oppose a
heavy-handed program of federal bureaucrats dictating industrial
policy. The government's past tries at picking winners have
typically been expensive flops such as the effort to create a
synthetic fuels industry in the 1970s.
   Instead, the manufacturers want an ``industry-led'' policy where
the private sector judges the market and chooses products and
research programs worthy of special backing.
   ``It's not a bunch of guys in Washington sitting in a closet
saying this is the way it's going to be,'' said Robert Costello, a
former undersecretary of Defense, now at the Hudson Institute, a
private research group.
   Mosbacher, in a major departure from the free-market views of
the Reagan administration, endorsed that concept, which involves
cooperation rather than competition among companies, in a speech
earlier this month to the Economic Club of Detroit.
   The Commerce secretary and the manufacturers diverge, however,
on who should pay. Mosbacher wants an industry-led and mostly
industry-financed effort, while the manufacturing executives say
government must match private funding.
   ``I feel it is imperative that we communicate to the
administration that at some not too distant point more government
funding is needed,'' said Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., who led an
industrial policy conference last week attended by such high-tech
superstars as Robert Noyce, co-inventor of the microprocessor.
   But Mosbacher, speaking of the most likely candidate for a
public-private partnership, high-definition television, warned at a
congressional hearing that electronics companies asking for $1.35
billion in federal aid shouldn't expect Uncle Sam to act like
``Uncle Sugar.''
   Instead, he said industry can look to government to encourage
research through such methods as loosening antitrust restrictions
and providing tax incentives.
   Levine and other participants in last week's conference are
down-playing the money fight and lauding Mosbacher's step away from
the doctrines of the previous administration.
   Mosbacher's statements are ``a very significant step in the
right direction,'' Levine said. ``I don't want to underestimate the
differences we have with the administration at this point, but I
think they can be bridged.''
   However, it probably won't be enough to convince Mosbacher, even
though he enjoys great influence with President Bush, an old
friend. The commerce secretary reportedly faces opposition within
the Cabinet from chief economic adviser Michael Boskin and budget
director Richard Darman.
   Hoping to raise the public profile of industry's problems, the
manufacturing officials held a one-day ``Wake Up America!''
conference on May 25, the anniversary of President Kennedy's 1961
call to put an American astronaut on the moon.
   The executives said a government commitment as extensive as the
effort expended on the space race is needed to win the industrial
race with Japan and other foreign competitors.
   ``We must make it profitable for U.S. business to invest in the
United States,'' said Palle Smidt, senior vice president of the
Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corp. in Austin, Texas.
   A model that could serve as an example for many industries, they
say, is SEMATECH, a consortium of computer companies headed by
Noyce which is working to restore U.S. semiconductor production,
which has been eclipsed by Japan's.
   As to the appropriateness of the government involving itself in
assisting industries, Mitchell Kwertzman, chief executive officer
of Computer Solutions in Burlington, Vt., said, ``I for one would
like to see the government invest in winners, rather than have
government see its function as bailing out losers.''

   Ethnic groups and Soviet republics fighting for
more independence are using the televised proceedings of the new
parliament to bring their diverse demands before a national
audience for the first time.
   On Monday, deputies from two areas that have been the most vocal
in demanding more independence _ the Baltic republics and the
southern republic of Georgia _ used the questioning of Vice
President Anatoly I. Lukyanov to present demands striking at the
very unity of this vast nation.
   Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze, a university professor, demanded the
Congress of People's Deputies condemn the ``annexation of the
independent democratic Georgian republic'' by the Red Army in 1921,
saying it violated a 1920 treaty agreed to by Soviet founder
Vladimir I. Lenin.
   For the Baltics, Lithuanian prosecutor Egidius V. Bichkauskas
questioned Lukyanov about the 1939 pact between Soviet Foreign
Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German counterpart Joachim von
Ribbentrop.
   ``As a result of this pact, sovereign Lithuania and the other
Baltic republics were occupied and incorporated into the Soviet
Union, losing their independent statehood,'' Bichkauskas noted.
   Lukyanov replied only by saying the consequences of the
Soviet-German pact is under study by a review commission.
   Both the Georgian and Lithuanian deputies implied that the
Soviet Union, made up of 15 republics, was created in part by force
and against the will of the people in their republics.
   Groups from the Caucasian and Baltic republics have increased
contact with one another in recent months to intensify pressure for
more sovereignty over their own affairs.
   Such radical demands have been echoed in more muted tones in
other regions, particularly the Central Asian republics of
Uzbekistan, Tadzhikistan and Kirgizia.
   Lone Central Asian deputies, such as Vladimir Zolotukhin from
Tashkent, have complained their delegations were manipulated by
party and other chiefs.
   Generally, however, the Central Asian delegates have been part
of what historian Yuri Afanasyev labeled the ``aggressively
obedient majority,'' lauding Gorbachev and unanimously supporting
the leadership.
   Moscow and Leningrad progressives scathingly jest about this
behavior, prompting Kazakh delegate Galina Amangeldinova to
announce Monday: ``I am afraid to sit with the Moscow delegation.''
   There also have been fierce exchanges between delegates from
Armenia and Azerbaijan, two southern republics in bitter conflict
over the fate of Nagorno-Karabakh, an area within Azerbaijan with a
predominantly Armenian population.
   The ethnic conflict, which has sparked fatal rioting in the
republics, boiled to the surface on Thursday, when Armenian artist
Genrikh Igityan demanded public condemnation the February 1988 riot
in Sumgait in which 31 Armenians were killed. He said the deaths in
the Azerbaijani city should receive the same attention several
delegates from various regions gave the use of special anti-riot
forces in Tbilisi.
   Muslum Mamedov, Communist Party leader in Azerbaijan's capital,
Baku, shot back angrily that ``we have never sought confrontation''
and charged, without mentioning specifics, that Armenians also had
killed Azerbaijanis.
   In the commotion over the more well-known ethnic conflicts,
demands from smaller Soviet peoples have passed largely unnoticed.
   Khamzat A. Fargiev, a representative of the 100,000 Ingushes
living on the edge of Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol, used
Monday's debate to reiterate what he said were two unanswered
petitions for an independent Ingush region.
   Each petition has been supported by more than 60,000 Ingushes,
he noted, adding that his people also support demands from Volga
Germans and Crimean Tartars for restoration of a measure of their
independence. They were among the minority groups deported from
their homes under Josef Stalin.
   ``This is the next national crisis,'' Fargiev warned of the
problem of the Ingushes, whose conflicts with Chechens, Ossetians
and other neighboring peoples led authorities in 1984 to bring in
special security forces and impose a curfew in the regional center
of Ordzhonokidze.
   His prediction drew far less attention than a semiserious jibe
from a Siberian delegate over the age-old Russian practice of
sending criminals and inefficient officials to his bleak region.
   ``Please, don't send any more of that scum to us in Siberia,''
pleaded writer Roman X. Solntsev amid general laughter from the
floor. Lukyanov gravely thanked him for the remark, noting that
``there are whole regions'' in Siberia where ``it's difficult to
restore order.''

<HEAD>Action Planned on Legislation This Week Despite Leadership Turmoil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two bills facing threatened vetoes _ one
containing more money to fight drugs and the other restrictions on
a $7 billion deal with Japan to develop an FSX fighter _ may
dominate whatever attention Congress does not devote to turmoil in
its leadership ranks this week.
   Speaker Jim Wright's problems with alleged violations of House
ethics rules and the surprise weekend resignation of Rep. Tony
Coelho, No. 3 in the leadership, have cast a cloud not only over
their own futures but also Congress itself.
   Nonetheless, its legislative work goes on _ even in a
holiday-shortened week in which the speaker could resign and a
successor be chosen both to him and Coelho.
   The Senate is scheduled to take up a domestic spending bill
Thursday that would devote $822 million more this year atop the
$5.3 billion already designated for anti-drug initiatives.
   The bill was approved by the House last week despite a vow by
administration officials to recommend that Bush veto it on grounds
it deepens the federal deficit and that anti-drug spending already
has been increased by 39 percent since last year.
   The legislation also includes $1.2 billion for raising veterans'
benefits and improving their health programs, $893 million to
student college loans, $423 million for foster care aid and $88
million for public housing.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, also wants to add $6.6 million to the
bill to subsidize commercial airline service to rural areas and $75
million to rebuild a radio telescope in his state that collapsed
last year.
   The House, meanwhile, may take up the agreement between Bush and
Japan allowing Japanese firms access to U.S. technology for the
development of their own version of General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16
fighter jet.
   The Senate approved the deal two weeks ago, but only by a narrow
52-47 margin and only after amending it to prohibit Japan from
using advanced U.S. jet engine technology to foster their own
aerospace industry.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week softened the
restrictions to set up a mechanism for Congress to disapprove any
such technology transfers after Secretary of State James A. Baker
III was quoted as saying Bush would veto any bill that put limits
on the terms he can negotiate with Japan.
   The agreement was tentatively scheduled for House action on
Thursday. If approved, differences with the Senate version would
have to be ironed out by negotiators for both bodies.
   Critics, led by Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., have complained that
Japan should be buying export versions of the F-16 and reducing its
$50 billion trade deficit with the United States instead of
insisting of co-developing their own version using U.S. technology.
   On Wednesday, the House is scheduled to act on a bill to make 37
individuals, partnerships and companies start developing shale oil
mining claims on 246,366 acres of federal land in Colorado, Utah
and Wyoming or lose them.
   Most of the 1,846 claims were staked out between 1915 and 1918.
While never developed, the claims have precluded use of the land
for other purposes such as recreation or grazing.
   The bill by Rep. Nick Joe Rahall, D-W.Va., would require the
holders to spend $5,000 a year on each claim in a ``diligent
effort'' to get them in full production between 2015 and 2018 or
forfeit them.
   Since shale oil is not viewed as an economically viable energy
source in today's market, the real purpose is to prevent the land
from being turned over to private interests for as little as $2.50
an acre.
   Rahall and other supporters have said they want to avoid a
repeat of a 1986 settlement with the Interior Department in which
mining claim holders exercised lease rights on 82,000 acres for
$2.50 each only to sell the rights later to Shell Oil Co. and
others for up to $2,000 an acre.
   The Senate on Wednesday will consider reauthorizing for another
five years the Strategic Petroleum Reserve intended to serve as an
energy life jacket in the event of another oil embargo or other
worldwide shortage.
   The reserve, begun two years after the 1973 Arab oil embargo,
now has 570 million barrels of oil _ slightly less than a 90-day
supply _ stored in salt caves in Texas and Louisiana.
   With U.S. oil imports rising 50 percent in the last three years,
the legislation would raise the reserve's ceiling from 750 million
barrels to 1 billion barrels early in the next century.
   The bill also gives the president greater authority to divert
oil for the reserve to refineries in an effort to suppress price
shocks such as the upward spiral two months ago after the Exxon
Valdez tanker spill in Alaska.
   Also before the Senate Wednesday is a measure by Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill., to encourage television networks, local stations and
cable systems to develop guidelines on depicting violence and drug
use.
   Technically, Simon's bill only exempts the industry from
antitrust claims that might result from joint efforts to develop
the guidelines. But the legislation is clearly aimed at reducing
the level of violence on TV.
   Network executives haven't embraced the measure, but they also
haven't tried to stop. Vehement opposition has been voiced by the
American Liberties Union, which has called it a step toward
censorship and a threat to First Amendment rights of free speech
under the Constitution.

   Jimmy Stewart says he's ready for another movie,
if the right script comes along.
   ``Can't play cowboys anymore,'' he adds, however.
   Stewart, 81, who hasn't acted in about five years, was
interviewed for the June issue of Vogue.
   The star, who once ran the movie projector in his hometown of
Indiana, Pa., acquired a degree in architecture from Princeton.
That profession was of little use at the height of the Depression,
so he opted for acting.
   Acting troupes led to Broadway walk-on roles, and after a few
years, New York led to Hollywood. Within four years, he'd made 25
movies.
   At 32, with credits that included ``Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington'' and ``The Philadelphia Story,'' Stewart entered the
Army in 1941, becoming one of the few movie stars to serve in World
War II.
   He returned to Hollywood fearful of his future, with his
contract expired and wondering if the public would still remember
him.
   ``That's why I thank (director) Frank Capra in prayers every
day,'' he said. ``'Cause he just, out of the blue, called me up and
said, `I got an idea for a story, and why don't you come down to
the house?'''
   The result was ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' which was not
successful when it became out but has since become a much-loved
Christmastime perennial.
   ``Looking back over it, I can just see that the picture meant
more to me than any other,'' said Stewart.

   Is-she or isn't-she speculation is
cropping up again from so-called family sources who Monday denied
earlier reports that Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is
expecting a second child.
   It also was family sources who confirmed Pakistani newspaper
reports in March that Ms. Bhutto, who became the head of government
after general elections in November 1988, was expecting a baby this
October.
   One source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the rumor
apparently started when Ms. Bhutto gained weight earlier this year.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, was wed to Karachi businessman Asif Ali Zardari
in a traditional Moslem arranged marriage in December 1987. She
gave birth to a son, Bilawal, on Sept. 21, 1988.
   Family sources also gave conflicting information during that
pregnancy. Some told reporters the baby was due as late as December.
   Ms. Bhutto is scheduled to deliver the commencement address at
Harvard University, her alma mater, on June 8.

   Singer Celia Cruz, the first lady of
salsa music, was awarded an honorary doctor of music degree Monday
from Yale University during the school's 288th commencement
exercises.
   ``Your unique style has forged in this, your adopted country, a
new form of Caribbean music and made salsa an international rhythm
in which you have once again proclaimed an unbowed affirmation of
life,'' said a citation read by Yale President Benno C. Schmidt Jr.
   Cruz, now a resident of New York, began singing on radio in her
native Cuba in the late 1940s. She went into voluntary exile in
1960, after the Communist takeover, eventually settling in the
United States.
   Her popularity spread to audiences in the United States during
the 1970s when a version of the traditional bolero, mamba and
guaracha music known as salsa became popular on the East Coast. She
has made more than 50 albums.
   Cruz, who does not disclose her age, is believed to be in her
early 60s.

   When he's at work, Nana Opoku Asamoah tends to
his real estate and coin-operated laundry interests, negotiating in
impeccable English.
   But when the 41-year-old native of Ghana assumes his role as
king of 20,000 Ashanti, he speaks only in his native Twi and avoids
direct conversation with outsiders.
   Nana Asamoah was crowned Saturday as surrogate king of the
10,000 Ashanti in the United States. In the large ballroom of the
Roosevelt Hotel, the king accepted gifts and greetings from chiefs
and royalty from the Ashanti and other Ghanaian tribe, the Ewe and
Akwapim.
   Nana Asamoah, who was born into a family of prosperous cocoa
farmers, became king in January by election of the Asanteman
Association, not by birthright like the long line of Ashanti kings
in Ghana.
   Speaking in Twi through his translators, Nana Asamoah said his
greatest challenge is ``seeing that our children not lose sight of
their culture in the melting pot of New York.''

   Black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela will be
honored in mid-June with a prize named after Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, the Libyan news agency JANA said Monday.
   JANA, in a dispatch from Tripoli which was monitored in Rome,
did not say if the prize consisted of money or who exactly was
sponsoring it. The Observer newspaper reported Sunday in London
that the award is worth $250,000 and that Libya is establishing a
$10 million foundation in Geneva for future awards.
   Mandela, 70, has been serving a life sentence in South Africa
since 1962 for planning an African National Congress campaign to

   Alexandra Ripley, who's writing a sequel
to ``Gone With the Wind,'' confided to graduates of her high school
alma mater that failing is OK and that lots of writers can be
pretty dumb.
   ``I urge you, with all of my strength, to go out there and fail.
... If you're not afraid to fail, possibilities are everywhere,''
she said Sunday in a commencement speech at Ashley Hall, a private
girls' school in Charleston.
   Ms. Ripley said when she graduated in 1951, she didn't dare to
dream she could be a writer because, ``Writers, real writers, I
thought, were people who were a million times smarter than I'd ever
be.'' But after meeting a few, she concluded that ``Surprise,
surprise. They weren't all that smart. Several of them, in fact,
were spectacularly dumb.''
   The author of several successful novels based in the South
signed a lucrative agreement with Margaret Mitchell's estate to
write a sequel to the author's classic Civil War novel. It's due
out in September 1990.
   She told the graduates she couldn't disclose whether Scarlett
O'Hara and Rhett Butler reunite in the sequel for two reasons:
``the publisher would chop me to little pieces if I did'' and ``I
haven't finished the book and I haven't even decided.''

   Men and women of the Armed Forces
and the U.S. Embassy observed Memorial Day with a small group of
Panamanians at a cemetery dedicated in part to those who
``contributed to the construction, operation and security of the
Panama Canal.''
   At a sun-baked hilltop monument surrounded by palm trees and
purple and orange tropical flowers, about 150 people listened to
speeches, prayed and watched as Air Force A-37 Dragonflies flew
over in a ``missing man'' formation.
   The only mention of the political crisis that has brought 1,900
new U.S. troops to canal installations came when Rear Adm. Gerald
E. Gnecknow noted that a Marine who died last year was among those
being honored.
   Cpl. Ricardo M. Villahermosa of Santurce, Puerto Rico, was
killed by fellow Marine guards on April 11, 1988, at a fuel storage
depot as they tried to surround what they described as a group of
intruders.
   The Panamanian Defense Forces denied there was an intrusion and
said the death caused by trigger-happy U.S. troops.
   Gnecknow, the Southern Command naval chief, offered a brief
history of Memorial Day since the Civil War, with special mention
of the explosion that killed 47 people aboard the USS Iowa, which
he once commanded.
   ``I've come every year since we moved back four years ago,''
said Ed Figueroa, a U.S. citizen who was born in the former Canal
Zone and now works for General Electric.
   He and his wife, Blanca, put a spray of carnations on his
father's grave. Marcelo Figueroa was from Puerto Rico, moved to
Panama in 1920 and served in both World War I and World War II.
   ``I've come every year since I was a little girl. I like the
band, I like the colors,'' said a middle-aged Panamanian woman who
refused to give her name. She said her husband worked for the
Panama Canal Commission.
   A gray-haired man said he was looking for his brother's grave _
he was in the Army and died on duty at Fort Amador, a former U.S.
canal installation. He, too, refused to give his name.
   ``You've got to be careful these days,'' he said.
   Most of the 30 Panamanians stood along a road below the hilltop.
A few Panamanian Cub Scouts saluted both the Panamanian and U.S.
national anthems.
   The Corozal American Cemetery, containing nearly 5,000 graves,
was established in 1904, when the United States started
constructing the canal. Treaties call for the 17-acre section where
Americans are interred to be maintained by the American Battle
Monuments Commission even after the United States cedes the canal
to Panama at the end of 1999.
   Elsewhere in Panama, Monday was an ordinary working day.
Panamanian newspapers attacked U.S. motives in calling for the
ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Teachers began preparations
for a school year that begins on June 5, two weeks late after being
postponed because of civil unrest following Panama's nullified May
7 presidential election.
   The latest joke making the rounds concerned the advice given to
a foreign correspondent who wanted to see the end of Noriega's
rule: ``Buy a house.''

   Former U.S. arms control director Ralph
Earle II praised President Bush's proposal Monday to cut NATO and
Warsaw Pact non-nuclear forces, but said he doubts work on a treaty
can be completed in six months to a year.
   Earle, who negotiated the 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty
with the Soviet Union for the Carter administration, said Bush's
timetable is ``overly optimistic.''
   In an interview, the former U.S. official also foresaw potential
problems in defining combat aircraft and other weapons and a
possible attempt by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
include naval forces.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has an edge over the
Warsaw Pact in combat ships in Europe, Earle said.
   ``No matter how much political will, there are going to be
substantial problems,'' Earle said.
   He predicted it would take two years to complete negotiations in
the Conventional Forces in Europe talks in Vienna.
   Earle praised Bush for putting the stress on conventional forces
instead of nuclear wepaons as the most important disarmament issue
in Europe.
   He said the Bush plan is ``achievable,'' but could have gone
further to ease tensions if the president also had proposed
withdrawal of tanks and other powerful weapons from the East-West
divide. He said such a disarmament corridor could help avert a
conflict between East and West.

<HEAD>Police Indict Suspect in Palme Murder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors indicted a man with a
violent criminal past Monday for the murder of Prime Minister Olof
Palme, who was shot down on a snowy street in Stockholm more than
three years ago.
   The 3,000 pages of evidence in the indictment outlined a case
against Carl Gustav Christer Pettersson, 42, that relied heavily on
the testimony of Palme's widow, Lisbet, and other witnesses who put
the defendant at the scene.
   The Palmes were walking home from a movie the night of Feb. 28,
1986, without bodyguards, when the killer fired from close range
and fled into a side street.
   ``He fits my description. The outline of his face, his eyes and
the terrifying face,'' the indictment quoted Mrs. Palme as telling
investigators.
   In addition to first degree murder, Pettersson is charged with
the attempted murder of Mrs. Palme, who was slightly wounded.
   Pettersson has denied killing Palme.
   His attorney, Arne Liljefors, said the prosecution had not
provided a motive or forensic evidence to support the charges.
Pettersson was arrested Dec. 14 in a twist to a case which that
focused on possible international conspiracies.
   Police and security agencies had been accused of bungling the
case and failing to turn up credible leads despite a reward of 50
million kronor ($8 million). Three police chiefs and a justice
minister resigned at various points in the investigation.
   Palme, a dynamic and controversial politician, was a U.N.
mediator in the Iran-Iraq war and an advocate of world disarmament.
He led Social Democratic governments in Sweden for 11 years.
   Prosecutors said 33 witnesses would support their case that
Pettersson followed the Palmes down Sveavagen Boulevard, and some
would testify he had access to a weapon and lied about his
whereabouts.
   Liljefors, the defense lawyer, indicated he would question the
credibility of witnesses testifying three years after the crime.
Prosecutor Jorgen Almbland said of the evidence: ``I am convinced
this is enough to win a conviction.'' According to the indictment,
Mrs. Palme said ``she thought it was youngsters playing with
firecrackers'' when she heard the shots, ``and she turned toward
her husband to comment.''
   ``At the same moment he collapsed, badly bleeding from his chest
and mouth,'' it said. ``Mrs. Palme heard another bang and felt a
burning sensation in her back.''
   She saw a running man, who stopped briefly and turned to face
her before continuing to flee, the indictment said.
   ``He was in his 40s, around 180 centimeters (6 feet) tall, with
a compact body and short neck,'' Mrs. Palme was quoted as saying.
``He was dark, but not like from southern lands.''
   Pettersson, a drug and alcohol addict, has a record of more than
60 crimes, including a conviction for stabbing a man to death with
a bayonet.
   He was questioned and released in the first weeks of the
investigation, but called in again last year when police discovered
holes in his alibi.

<HEAD>Bush: Soviets No Longer Fostering Terrorism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says the Soviet Union, which has
been accused over the years of supporting various terrorist
organizations, no longer fosters terrorism.
   In an interview with columnist Jack Anderson for a syndicated
television program on terrorism, Bush said the Soviets appear to
have mended their ways.
   ``I don't believe the Soviets are now engaged in terrorist
activities,'' said Bush. ``There's no hard evidence out there that
I have seen ... certainly since I've been president ... that makes
me feel they are a state that's involved in condoning or
encouraging terrorism.''
   Bush, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency,
said, ``There was a time when there was some training that went on
inside the Soviet Union, that was directly related with terrorist
activities.''
   He added that such training ``might not have been done under the
name of terrorism, but we had liberation movements in different
names for different causes.''
   Asked about indications the Soviets are willing to cooperate
with the United States to fight terrorism, the president said, ``If
that offer is for real ... we ought to explore it. ... I believe
that under new leadership, the Soviets will cooperate ... not only
in renouncing terror publicly ... but working to counter it.
   ``If there are certain areas where their intelligence would be
far better than ours, and if we could enter into a sharing
agreement that would avert these terrorist acts, I'd be all for
it,'' he said.
   The program for which Bush was interviewed, entitled ``Target:
USA!'', will be broadcast Wednesday on about 140 television
stations, according to Gene Nichols, a spokesman for the producers
who made a transcript of the program available in advance.

   A trial that starts this week pitting an
Indianapolis art dealer against the rival Greek and Turkish
governments of Cyprus could have repercussions throughout the world
for claims to national art treasures.
   Art dealer Peg Goldberg is being sued over four sixth-century
mosaics that some call the most important Christian antiquities
ever to come on the market. Cypriot authorities claim they were
ripped from the walls of a village church.
   If U.S. District Judge James E. Noland rules for Goldberg,
millions of dollars worth of plundered antiquities could pour into
this country, some analysts predict.
   ``Lawyers for American collectors, both institutional and
private, will be watching this for its implications,'' said
Constance Lowenthal, executive director of the International
Foundation for Art Research in New York.
   ``American collections do have many antiquities whose origins
are unclear. It's an important case. The stakes are high and the
implications could be very broad.''
   In March, the Republic of Cyprus and the Autocephalous Greek
Orthodox Church of Cyprus sued Goldberg and her dealership,
Goldberg and Feldman Fine Arts of suburban Carmel.
   Cyprus claims the mosaics were taken illegally to Europe from
Lythrankomi in 1979. The village is under the control of a
breakaway Turkish government that has ruled the northern third of
the war-torn island nation since 1974.
   The self-designated Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus entered
the fray on Wednesday when it filed a request to intervene in the
lawsuit and claimed it is the rightful owner of the mosaics. Turkey
is the only country that recognizes the Turkish occupation state.
   Joseph D. Youssouf, a New Jersey lawyer representing Turkish
Cyprus, said his client was eager to argue its case in court.
   ``Who is the Republic of Cyprus, who are the Turkish Cypriots
and who owns the mosaics are all interrelated questions,'' Youssouf
said. ``There's an awful lot at stake.''
   The mosaics, analysts say, are among only a relative handful of
artworks surviving from the first centuries of Christianity.
Fragments of a much larger work at Panagia Kanakaria church, they
depict heads of Christ as a boy, the apostles James and Matthew and
an archangel. The four pieces are each roughly 2 feet square.
   ``These mosaics, priceless examples of Byzantine art, are
irreplaceable aspects of our country's cultural heritage,'' said
Michael Kyprianou, a deputy state attorney general of Cyprus.
   Goldberg, 50, who usually deals in 19th and 20th century
American and European art, said she knew she was onto something big
when she first viewed the mosaics in Geneva, Switzerland, last June.
   ``I had some suspicions as I looked at them and my heart
stopped. I thought they were possibly extraordinarily important,
regardless of whatever else was proven in my mind,'' she said.
   ``We've been told they would be the most important Christian
antiquities ever to come on the market.''
   Goldberg claims she researched the legal status of the mosaics
before purchasing them in July for $1.1 million from Aydin Dikmen,
who said he was the former official archaeologist for Turkish
Cyprus. She has offered them for sale for $20 million, but they're
not on the market pending the outcome of the suit.
   According to Youssouf, Dikmen is a fraud and so were the customs
and shipping documents he produced for Goldberg.
   No U.S. law or treaty applies to the case. The United States and
Cyprus have both signed a UNESCO convention on stolen artworks, but
it does not apply here to properties removed from their home
country before 1983.
   The case could rest on two questions: Was Goldberg a good-faith
purchaser of the mosaics, as required by Swiss law, and was the
Republic of Cyprus diligent in trying to get the mosaics back?
   Under Swiss law, a sale is legal if the buyer acts openly and in
the good-faith belief that the item was obtained legally,
regardless of whether the seller legitimately owns the article.
   The law has made Switzerland a hotbed for international art
transactions.
   As for Cyprus' efforts to get back the mosaics, the government's
antiquities department notified museums in 1980 the mosaics were
gone. Two years later, the Cyprus Embassy in Washington issued a
news release.
   But Ms. Lowenthal said her foundation, which keeps files on
30,000 stolen artworks, was never notified.
   ``We're not so famous in the Mediterranean, but if a government
was eager to spread the word to all possible agencies, it would not
take them very long to discover our existence,'' she said.
   For now, the mosaics are in an Indianapolis bank vault.
   Walter Hopps, director of the Menil Collection in Houston, who
last year solved a similar problem through a loan agreement with
Cyprus, said the lawsuit will become a test case.
   ``If the courts uphold the legality of the entry, if there's
even a window of time where it looks like it might stand, then the
possibility exists that millions and millions of dollars worth of
plundered antiquities will pour into the United States,'' he said.
``It will be a horrible precedent.''

<HEAD>Workers Wage General Strike for Higher Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of workers nationwide went
on strike for higher pay Monday, defying an appeal by President
Corazon Aquino who said labor unrest would discourage needed
foreign investment.
   The government said the general strike affected 169 companies
employing more than 137,000 workers.
   Unions said, however, that workers from 800 affiliates
nationwide walked off the job, including 110 at foreign companies
based in the Philippines. They said half a million workers on
central Luzon island alone stayed home.
   Monday's strike was called by the militant Labor Advisory
Consultative Council, a union umbrella group that claims a
nationwide membership of 900,000 workers.
   Council spokesman Crispin Beltran called the strike a success.
   ``Workers are rediscovering their strength,'' Beltran said. He
said unions covered by the council also would strike Tuesday.
   The strikes were called Friday by union goups hoping to increase
the daily minimum wage by $1.42. Currently, the minimum wage varies
from $2.55 and $3 a day depending upon area and type of work.
   The council said its workers also would join a nationwide
walkout Thursday called by the more moderate Trade Union Congress,
which claims a membership of 1.2 million workers.
   Mrs. Aquino has rejected the wage demand as inflationary and on
Sunday appealed to workers not to strike, saying the walkout would
discourage foreign investors and hurt the economy.
   ``I have already appealed to them to reconsider their drastic
mass action as it will prejudice the unemployed,'' Mrs. Aquino
said. ``Prospective investors might be discouraged, and at this
point, the most important thing is to create more jobs and
livelihood opportunities.''
   On Monday, the House of Representatives approved a bill that
would grant workers a raise of between 40 cents and $1 a day. The
Senate approved an increase of between 50 cents and $1, to be
implemented over a year.
   Representatives from the two chambers were to meet Tuesday to
reconcile the differences. Labor groups called the proposals
inadequate.
   Troops were placed on alert in Manila but there were no reports
of violence, said Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, head of the capital's
regional defense command. He said troops in the capital would
remain on alert through Thursday's planned strike.
   In Manila, a public transportation company took its 300 buses
off the streets and scores of workers stood in picket lines outside
factories, offices and department stores, according to radio and
television reports.
   Drivers on two bus lines between Manila and the Bataan peninsula
and workers at 12 companies in the Bataan Export Zone also walked
off the job, union officials said.
   In Davao, 600 miles southeast of the capital, the strike hit 56
factories and plantations, unions said. But local government
officials contacted by telephone said workers from only five
companies there were on strike.
   The labor unrest was blamed for a drop in share prices Monday on
the Manila Stock Exchange after a month of sustained growth. The
Composite Stock Index of 25 selected issues closed 21.50 points to
993.43, down from Friday's close of 1,014.93.
   On Saturday, more than 170,000 workers took part in a
preliminary strike, the council said.

<DATELINE>LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Monday they found an arms
cache that included shoulder-fired missiles they believe were to be
used against Lebanese army helicopters, possibly one carrying Gen.
Michel Aoun, the Christian leader.
   Andreas Potamaris, assistant police chief, said six Lebanese men
were arrested. He quoted one as saying: ``We came to Cyprus to
clear up our inter-Lebanese accounts.''
   Five of the suspects arrived illegally in two rubber dinghies,
police said.
   The carefully wrapped missiles were found 150 yards offshore,
about half a mile from the Larnaca airport apron the helicopters
use for daily flights between Cyprus and Lebanon.
   Police said the plot was uncovered when scuba divers found the
two Soviet-designed SAM-7 missiles and launchers Sunday on a reef
in about six feet of water. Only the firing mechanisms were missing.
   Aoun had been scheduled to go through the airport last week on
his way to an Arab League summit in Morocco, where Arab leaders
were discussing the 14-year-old Lebanese civil war, but did not
make the trip.
   Potamaris said police raided a beachfront apartment Monday and
found the dinghies, five Kalashnikov assault rifles, 13 magazines
of ammunition, 28 grenades, two limpet mines and the firing
mechanisms for the rockets.
   Although the targets had not been confirmed, he said, ``one can
draw an inference from the fact that the rocket launchers were
found less than a kilometer from the Larnaca airport apron, where
the helicopters of the Christian Lebanese army come and go daily.''
   Interior Minister Christodoulos Veniamin said on television the
target was an ``Arab personality'' who was to arrive by helicoptr,
but he did not elaborate.
   ``They planned to commit a crime on the soil of Cyprus and this
of course is unacceptable,'' he said. ``We are not sure yet what
they say is true because we just started the investigation.''
   Police sources said privately it may have been Aoun, whose
Christian army units have been fighting a Moslem alliance of
Syrians and Druse militiamen since early March.
   Two days before the missiles were discovered, police detained a
Lebanese for wandering through this southern port in a suspicious
manner. They found that Salam Khafasi did not have an entry stamp
in his passport.
   Through him, police found the other suspects and the apartment.
The other five arrested were identified as Tawfik Wadih Ashaar,
Idris Jamal Jaber, Wadih Salim Salamon, Rostom Najib Sirhan and
Emil Gharali.
   Police said Gharali, picked up Friday after Khafasi's arrest,
was the only one to enter Cyprus legally.
   Photographers were allowed to take pictures of the suspects, but
when asked why they were in Cyprus the men shouted: ``Get away! We
can't tell you anything!''
   In September, police found the tripod base for a Milan anti-tank
missile launcher on the Larnaca airport outskirts, but were unable
to determine who put it there or why.
   Omar Ahmed Hawwilo, a 28-year-old Lebanese, was sentenced to 15
years in prison last year for trying to blow up the Israeli Embassy
in Nicosia with a car bomb. It exploded 200 yards from the embassy
on May 11, 1988, killing the driver and two Cypriots and wounding
people.
   Three senior Palestine Liberation Organization guerrilla officrs
were killed by a car bomb in February 1988 at Limassol port in
southeern Cyprus. A ferry scheduled to carry Palestinians on a
protest voyage to Israel was disabled by a limpet mine the day
before.

<TEXT>
   Six bystanders were wounded, including a
young woman who remained in critical condition Monday, after a hail
of semi-automatic gunfire erupted outside a local bar when an
apparent drug deal went bad, police said.
   The six people were wounded Sunday morning in a drive-by
shooting outside the Dodge City Disco, said Detective Sgt. Mitchell
Dent of the Vicksburg Police Department. None was thought to be
involved in the deal, Dent said.
   Two remained hospitalized Monday.
   Three people were charged with aggravated assault and remained
in the Warren County Jail on Monday under $100,000 bonds each.
   The three were identified as Rosemarie Hogan, 24, of Vicksburg;
Martin D. Scrivner, 30, of Sulphur, La.; and Johnny R. Mowdy, 27,
of Canton. Each was charged with six counts of aggravated assault.
   Four of the wounded were treated and released from Mercy
Regional Medical Center. Sheila Carter, 20, was in critical but
stable condition, said hospital spokeswoman Jamie Segura. The other
hospitalized person, an 18-year-old woman, was in good condition
Monday.
   Police were still investigating the case, Dent said. But he said
it appears that an incident earlier at the bar involved a drug deal
that went sour.
   Dent said Mowdy, Scrivner and Hogan allegedly returned to the
bar as it was closing early Sunday, drove by in a van and sprayed
those standing outside the club with gunfire.
   They were arrested a short time after the shootings in a van
matching witnesses' description of the one involved in the
shooting. A semiautomatic rifle was found in the van.
   The Dodge City Disco is a predominately black bar where police
have made several drug arrests previously, Dent said. The three
charged with the shooting are white.

   Singer Connie Francis, whose meteoric career in
the 1950s and '60s crashed in a series of personal tragedies,
returned to the stage here and thanked fans who have stood by her
over the years.
   ``You've always let me know you were there, in good times and
bad, and for that I'll always love you,'' she told a cheering
audience after opening Saturday night with the song ``Let Me Try
Again.''
   The audience at the Aladdin Theatre for the Performing Arts gave
her several standing ovations as she reeled off gold record hits
such as ``Who's Sorry Now,'' ``Where the Boys Are,'' ``Stupid
Cupid'' and ``Lipstick on Your Collar'' while film clips recounted
her career.
   She sold more than 90 million records between 1958 and 1963.
Like many stars of her era, her career cooled with the invasion of
the Beatles in 1964.
   Then, in 1974, just hours after performing at the Westbury,
N.Y., Music Fair, Francis was raped and terrorized at knifepoint in
her motel room. The rapist has never been arrested. In 1979, she
won a $2.65 million damage award against the motel, described as a
landmark award for a rape victim at the time.
   In 1977, she underwent surgery that ruined her singing voice
until the problem was corrected years later.
   ``I was unable to sing for four long years,'' she told her
audience Saturday, touching on some of the problems that have
dogged her for 15 years.
   Career problems, three failed marriages and the death of her
brother, who was gunned down in the driveway of his New Jersey
home, led to emotional problems that required hospitalization on
occasion until six months ago.
   ``I've had the kinds of problems that almost everyone in the
world has had at one time or another, whether it's divorce, or
mental illness, violent crime or a death in the family,'' the
50-year-old singer said in an interview last week. ``Thank God it's
made me a strong person.''

<HEAD>President Will Shuffle Cabinet to Quell Unrest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo will shuffle his
Cabinet to quiet calls for his resignation and stop public
criticism of how the government has handled recent unrest,
officials said Monday.
   Among those expected to be replaced were the prime minister, the
head of the main intelligence agency and the home, labor and
construction ministers, the officials said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   All major Seoul newspapers carried reports of the expected
changes, which was expected to take place in the coming weeks,
officials said.
   Reports of the Cabinet changes came as a hunger strike by 300
radical students entered a fourth day Monday. The protesters want
Roh to step down.
   Many of the hunger strikers at the Roman Catholic Myongdong
Cathedral appeared weak and eight collapsed from fatigue but
refused to resume eating. Riot police surrounded the cathedral, but
made no move to intervene.
   Also on Monday, violence broke out in the streets of southern
Kwangju when riot police blocked a march by about 5,000 radical
students calling for Roh's resignation, the South Korean news
agency Yonhap reported.
   Anti-government protests by dissidents and students have
dwindled in recent weeks with police blocking many rallies. The
radical students lack public support because of their extremist
views.
   Under the Cabinet changes, senior ministers and Prime Minister
Kang Young-hoon will take the blame for recent unrest, the
officials said.
   Roh, who won presidential elections in 1987, is unhappy that
ministers have failed to win public confidence, officials said. The
president believes the administration needs a new, stronger image,
they said.
   ``Cabinet members to be replaced have not been decided, but it
is highly possible that the shuffle will affect many posts,'' one
official said.
   In South Korea, periodic Cabinet shuffles stop the presdient
from having to take responsibility for government failures. In
reality, however, Cabinet ministers have little autonomy.
   Park Seh-jik, head of the Agency for National Security Planning,
is being blamed for the security forces' failure to stop a
dissident clergyman, the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, from visiting North
Korea in March. Moon's visit led to violent confrontations between
police and dissidents, who want both nations reunited.
   Home Minister Lee Han-dong may be blamed for the threatened
resignation in April of thousands of police officers after an
opposition lawmaker slapped a top police commander, the officials
said.
   Labor Minister Chang Yung-chul and Social Affairs Minister Moon
Tai-joon are expected to take the blame for recent violent labor
strikes for higher pay, the officials said. Construction Minister
Park Seung may be removed because of widespread land speculation
caused by plans to build new cities, they said.

   Well-wishers hung from trees and tossed red roses
Monday as thousands of people marched behind populist Boris N.
Yeltsin in a spontaneous celebration of his stunning appointment to
the nation's new legislature.
   The 58-year-old firebrand was besieged by a roaring and
deliriously happy mass of supporters after he left the Kremlin,
where the Congress of People's Deputies had just given him a seat
in the new legislature, the Supreme Soviet.
   Yeltsin had failed to win enough votes in the Congress, a newly
created 2,250 parliament, to win election to the Supreme Soviet, a
full-time legislature that has been given broad powers.
   But one candidate who was elected by the Congress agreed to
resign to open a seat for Yeltsin _ a reformer considered perhaps
the most popular figure behind President Mikhail S. Gorbachev _ and
the Congress overwhelmingly agreed.
   The action came one day after thousands had protested Yeltsin's
defeate.
   ``Hooray! Hooray!'' Soviets shouted as they joined the towering,
silver-haired man from Sverdlovsk in a spontaneous victory march
through central Moscow.
   Most had learned of his victory from the live television and
radio broadcasts of the Congress session, but one incredulous
pedestrian asked the boisterous entourage, ``Is it really true?''
   ``Congratulations!'' yelled others who greeted Yeltsin as he
walked from the Kremlin and then along Gorky Street, one of
Moscow's busiest thoroughfares. ``All the people are with you,''
one man yelled to Yeltsin, who wore a blue-gray suit and towered
above the crowd.
   Anna Sabalova, with tears of joy in her eyes, told a reporter:
   ``We knew he was an honest person. We knew he was elected by
millions but that just a few in the Congress had held him back.''
   A city bus driver stopped after apparently spotting Yeltsin on a
sidewalk in front of the Kremlin. He honked his horn rhythmically,
and dozens of passengers got off to join the procession.
   It was a display of the kind of people power that gave Yeltsin
89 percent of the vote in citywide Moscow elections in March to the
Congress.
   Yeltsin smiled broadly and thanked supporters as he made his way
through the crush during a one-hour march to Pushkin Square, a
popular site for demonstrations where an estimated 5,000 people
gathered.
   Women kissed him, men shook his hand, and he carried red
carnations and pink roses given him by supporters.
   At the square, Yeltsin told a crowd of thousands _ some perched
on trees to get a glance of their new legislator _ that his
appointment was a ``victory by the people over the secret apparatus.
   ``I thank you for your faith,'' Yeltsin, using a megaphone, told
the jubilant crowd. He wound up the rally with his hands held above
his head in a gesture of victory.
   Even Yegor K. Ligachev, Yeltsin's conservative foe on the ruling
Politburo, was unusually conciliatory.
   ``It was democratic. It was just,'' Ligachev told reporters. ``I
have one way of looking at things, and he has another. The
important thing is to stick to party comradeship.''
   Yeltsin and Ligachev have clashed several times. After
criticizing the slow pace of Soviet reform and naming Ligachev as a
cause in October 1987, Yeltsin was fired as Moscow party chief and
lost his own non-voting seat on the Politburo.
   Human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov, a Congress deputy,
said in an interview that Yeltsin's elevation marked a
``restoration of justice,'' although he said it was not
accomplished smoothly.
   Yeltsin, with a wide smile, told reporters as he left the
session his appointment showed the Congress was becoming
``gradually more democratic.''

<HEAD>Seabrook Operators Start Low-Power Testing Process</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The process of heating up the reactor at
the Seabrook nuclear power plant reached its first major step
Monday as operators prepare the controversial plant for its first
low-power testing.
   The first atomic chain reaction, expected within seven to 10
days, will be the biggest milestone yet for a plant that is a
decade behind schedule, billions of dollars over budget and a focus
of the nation's anti-nuclear movement.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Seabrook its low-power
license last Friday. The heating process began Saturday, and on
Monday morning, the water in the reactor's cooling system reached
200 degrees.
   ``Everything's going smoothly and as planned,'' Seabrook
spokesman Ron Sher said. ``We want to conduct low-power tests as
soon as possible to make sure there are no adjustements we need to
make to the plant.''
   The reactor must reach 557 degrees, expected to take five days,
before preparations can begin to start the nuclear chain reaction
in the 100 tons of uranium fuel.
   Nearly three years after the reactor was completed, the $6
billion project surmounted most obstacles to win NRC approval for
the tests on May 18. But the commission granted a one-week stay of
the license so a federal court could rule on requests to delay the
tests.
   Last Thursday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia declined to delay the tests, and the low-power
license was issued Friday by the NRC's Office of Nuclear Reactor
Regulation.
   The license will let Seabrook conduct atomic tests at up to 5
percent of full power. The plant must win final federal approval
for evacuation plans for nearby communities before it could operate
commercially.
   Evacuation in case of emergency is the major issue raised by
opponents of the plant, who say communities in the area couldn't
possibly be evacuated soon enough.
   Late Saturday, plant operators began opening valves and rapidly
circulating 100,000 gallons of water through the reactor coolant
system. The reactor is heated by the friction of that fast-water
circulation.
   After the reactor reaches 557 degrees, operators will have to
calibrate instruments and perform other tests before they can
remove control rods from the reactor core and dilute the boron
concentration in the reactor coolant water.
   The boron and control rods absorb neutrons from decaying uranium
atoms, preventing them from striking other uranium atoms and
starting a chain reaction. Removing them allows the neutrons to
split uranium atoms and begin a self-sustained nuclear chain
reaction.
   There would be about seven days of tests, at power levels
ranging from 0.01 percent to 3 percent of the reactor's capacity.
After those tests, the reactor would be cooled down again until the
next step in the fight over whether the plant will go into
operation or be scrapped.

   Good luck and bad teeth reunited two
former prisoners of war who had not seen each other since they were
freed from a German camp more than 40 years ago.
   Bernard Brown and Edward Molnar, who live 55 miles apart, were
both at the Syracuse Veterans Administration Medical Center on
April 26.
   Brown saw a dental assistant struggling with a computer and
jokingly said, ``Raus, alles kaput,'' a phrase he learned during 3{
months in the Bad Orb prison camp east of Frankfurt, Germany. The
guards often shouted the phrase, loosely translated as, ``Out,
everything's on the fritz.''
   The words startled Molnar, 72, who was at the clinic to have a
tooth pulled.
   Molnar looked at Brown, and Brown said, ``I know you from
someplace.''
   ``As soon as he mentioned his name, I remembered right off the
bat,'' Brown, 65, recalled later. ``We were both medics attached to
the infantry, and we worked together in a dispensary at the prison
camp.''
   Brown is a retired insurance agent, and Molnar is a retired
Broome County sheriff's deputy.
   Germans captured the two Dec. 19, 1944, during the Battle of the
Bulge in southeastern Belgium, northern Luxembourg and northern
France.
   The last time they saw each other was April 2, 1945, when U.S.
troops freed them from the prison camp. They both said they plan to
keep in touch.

<TEXT>
   For the 17th consecutive Memorial Day, a pink
rose was left on Polly Scantlin's grave in a Joplin cemetery and
her family has no idea who is responsible.
   Ms. Scantlin, who lived in the area most of her life, was 81
when she died in 1971. Pink roses were Ms. Scantlin's favorite, and
before she died she asked for an arrangement of them at her
funeral, said her daughter, Dora Miller.
   Ms. Scantlin's family has tried for years to determine who sends
the flower, even staking out the grave on the Friday before
Memorial Day to watch for the deliverer. But a bouquet of pink
roses or a single rose always was already on the grave.
   Caretakers of the Ozark Memorial Park Cemetery say they have no
clues, either.
   ``We don't have any idea who it is,'' says Mrs. Miller. ``I
would ask everybody I would see, `Have you put those flowers on
Mama's grave?' I have asked people for years.
   ``I've asked all the family. I've asked all the friends.''
   Ms. Scantlin's husband died in 1972, and most of her friends are
dead. Her only other living child, a daughter in Arkansas, also has
no idea who sends the flower.

   A Honolulu-bound jumbo jet with 205 people
aboard developed a fuel leak over the Pacific Ocean, but landed
safely early Monday after being diverted to Hilo, authorities said.
   Pilots shut down the TWA airliner's left wing engine when fuel
began leaking from the wing, said Don Morrison, an airline
spokesman in St. Louis.
   ``The captain was not able to do anything to stop the leak, and
made a precautionary landing in Hilo,'' Morrison said.
   TWA Flight 235, bound from Los Angeles, reported it was low on
fuel and 450 miles out of Honolulu at 11:30 p.m. HST Sunday,
according to Dick Hallen, a Federal Aviation Administration duty
officer in Los Angeles.
   The L-1011 was instructed to divert to Hilo International
Airport on Hawaii Island, southernmost and easternmost in the
Hawaiian chain and more than 200 miles from Honolulu, Hallen said.
   The plane landed safely at 12:40 a.m., escorted by two F-15 jet
fighters from the Hawaii Air National Guard and a Coast Guard C-130
search-and-rescue airplane, according to Christopher Kimbrough, a
spokesman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Center in Honolulu.
   Marilyn Kali, a state Transportation Department spokeswoman,
said fire-crash rescue workers could see fuel leaking after the
plane landed. The landing, however, was described as routine.
   Morrison said the cause of the leak was under investigtion.
   The plane carried 190 passengers and 15 crew members. The
passengers were brought to Honolulu aboard a chartered plane,
Morrison said.

<UNK>Soviet General and Vet of Afghan Fighting Visit Vietnam Memorial</UNK>

   Among the thousands of visitors to the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial on Monday were a Soviet general who fought in
World War II and a veteran of the Soviet fighting in Afghanistan.
   The two Russians were guests of several Vietnam veteran groups.
   Lt. Gen. Vladamir Orlov, chief of a World War II veterans group
in the Soviet Union, and Mikhail Vishnyakov, a veteran of the
fighting in Afghanistan, marveled at the impact of the Vietnam
memorial.
   The two even traced some of the 58,160 names etched into the
marble monument wall onto paper, as do many of the tourists who
visit the memorial, according to John Wheeler, a Vietnam veteran
who helped arrange the visit.
   The Soviet Union's military struggle in Afghanistan, from which
the country was forced to withdraw after years of fighting, has
been compared to the U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.
   Wheeler said Orlov and Vishnyakov told him that when they return
to the Soviet Union they hope to convince the Soviet government to
establish a similar monument in Moscow honoring the Soviet dead in
Afghanistan.
   The Soviet Union was a chief provider of supplies and weapons
for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.

   To the beat of muffled drums and the sound
of a fife, the remains of 19 black Union soldiers lost since the
Civil War were escorted Monday to their final resting place in a
National Cemetery.
   The remains, unearthed two years ago during road construction at
Folly Beach, S.C., are those of members of the 54th and 55th
Massachusetts Regiment and the 1st North Carolina Infantry
Regiment, three black units that fought for the North in the Civil
War.
   The Massachusetts regiments were the first Union regiments
formed with volunteer black troops.
   The soldiers were believed killed during a July 18, 1863,
assault on Fort Wagner, outside Charleston, S.C., although they
also may have died of disease.
   They had been buried in a military cemetery within the Union
encampment outside Fort Wagner, but the burial ground apparently
was neglected and forgotten after the war.
   Among those at the Memorial Day ceremony were Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis and two men whose forefathers fought in the
Massachusetts regiments. The three laid a wreath in front of the
coffins, laid out in three rows.
   More than 4,000 people gathered at an edge of the cemetery
beneath three sprawling oak trees.
   ``Here we hear not only the voices of Massahcusetts' past and
the cannon of Fort Wagner, but the warm promise of our nation; of
the blood of its men and women, black and white, alive with a love
of our beautiful land,'' Dukakis said.
   ``This issue of black men fighting for the Union Army was highly
controversial at the time. I'm proud to say they were supported by
the people of Massachusetts,'' Dukakis said.
   The remains were buried in accordance with 1863 Army regulations
and the coffins were covered with a 34-star American flag. The
Massachusetts state flag also was draped on each coffin.
   They were escorted to the burial site at the National Cemetery
in Beaufort by actors dressed as Union soldiers from the movie
``Glory,'' about the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, which recently
completed filming near Savannah, Ga.
   Soil from Massachusetts was sprinkled onto the coffins.
   ``The black soldiers of the Massachusetts 54th and 55th
Regiments were fighting for their own liberty, to grasp their own
freedom and to ensure both for others of their own race,'' Dukakis
said.
   Deputy state archeologist Steven Smith said other members of the
Massachusetts regiments also are buried in the cemetery. He said
they died at the Civil War battle of Honey Hill about 12 miles from
Beaufort.

   Authorities filed charges Monday against
13 members of a right-wing youth group who briefly delayed
President Bush's motorcade the day before by forming a human
pyramid in its path.
   The members of Youth Front were accused of resisting police,
demonstrating without authorization and trying to block an official
motorcade.
   About 40 demonstrators vaulted barricades and made the pyramid
as the Bush cars headed for the St. Francis Roman Catholic church
in Nettuno on Sunday.
   None tried to reach the president's limousine. Some threw
leaflets that questioned whether the Allied landing at Nettuno and
nearby Anzio on Jan. 22, 1944, was a liberation or an invasion.
   Police needed only about three minutes to clear Bush's way. The
demonstrators said at the time they belonged to the National Right
Italian Social Movement, Italy's neo-fascist and fourth largest
political party.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said police identified one of those
charged as Giovanni Alemanno, national secretary of the Youth
Front. Conviction on the charges carries a possible jail sentence
of six months to five years.

   A killer on the U.S. Marshals Service's
15 most-wanted list was captured Monday after he fled from a
roadblock on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, authorities said.
    James Weddell, 33, of Wagner, was serving an 80-year
manslaughter sentence for beating a man to death when he escaped
from a maximum-security prison in Sioux Falls on May 26, 1987, with
five other inmates. The others were captured.
   Weddell was in a car that was stopped at the roadblock.
   ``The Pine Ridge Police Department was stopping cars coming back
from some kind of a band concert ... that they'd had down there,''
said Bob Leighton, a deputy U.S. marshal from Rapid City.
   When authorities got the driver and two passengers out of one
car, someone jumped into the driver's seat and sped away in the
car, Leighton said.
   ``One of the people said, `There goes Weddell,' and they took
off and pursued the vehicle,'' he said.
   The driver abandoned the car and ran to a creek bottom. Police
searched and found Weddell, who had a weapon but did not fire it.
   Weddell was being held in the Pennington County Jail in Rapid
City until a scheduled court appearance Tuesday morning.

   Israeli settlers rampaged through a West Bank
village on Monday and shot a 16-year-old Palestinian girl to death,
residents said. She was the 500th Arab to die in the uprising
against Israeli rule of the occupied lands.
   Residents said the settlers beat townspeople, smashed cars and
set fire to wheat fields and olive trees.
   The settlers became enraged and opened fire when they were
attacked by Palestinian stone-throwers as they were hiking near the
village, Israel radio quoted security sources as saying.
   The army confirmed a Palestinian teen-ager was killed and two
youths were wounded at Kifil Harith, about 10 miles southwest of
Nablus. The village is about 100 yards from the Jewish settlement
of Ariel.
   An army spokesman said Israeli troops were not responsible and
he was checking reports settlers did the shooting. He said the army
clamped a curfew on the village of 3,000 to aid its investigaton.
   It was the worst incident in a recent outbreak of vigilante
reprisal raids by Jewish settlers on Arab communities. The settlers
have said they are frustrated by what they consider to be army
complacency in the face of Arab stoning and firebomb attacks.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir denounced vigilantism, saying on
Israel radio, ``In ... Israel, it's forbidden to take justice into
your own hands, even if you have reasons, because it damages the
foundations of the state.''
   His deputy, Finance Minister Shimon Peres, declared, ``There
cannot be a situation where people decide how the law is enforced.''
   The death raised to 500 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising began in December 1987 against Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Settlers killed 19 of the Arabs.
Twenty-two Israelis also died.
   Legislator Yossi Sarid told Parliament on Monday that the
Palestine Liberation Organization has conditionally accepted
Israel's proposal for elections in the occupied lands to choose
delegates for peace talks with Israel.
   ``The PLO has already agreed to elections and passed this on to
Washington,'' said Sarid, of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement.
   Palestinian witnesses and Israeli news reports said the girl who
was killed Monday, Ibtisam Abdel Rahim Bozieh, was shot in the
chest by settlers who raided Kifil Harith about 2 p.m.
   Abdel Jalil Saleh, head of the village council, said up to 40
settlers from Ariel entered the village and set fire to wheat
fields and olive groves while indiscriminately shooting in the air
for about one hour. Five cars also were vandalized.
   The group also set fire to wood in front of a house, said Saleh,
speaking by telephone.
   He said Miss Bouziah left the house to see what was happening
and was shot.
   He said Ghassam Mohammed Salah, 17, also was shot and was in
serious condition at Tel Aviv's Beilenson Hospital. Other residents
were beaten, Saleh said.
   Saleh complained soldiers at a checkpoint leading to the village
did not try to stop the settlers from entering.
   ``There was no reason for this attack,'' said Saleh, adding
settlers had raided over the weekend and burned or uprooted 10
olive trees. ``We are not armed like the settlers. We are
defenseless.''
   Israel radio said the settlers were visiting the grave of the
biblical Joshua, near Kifil Harith, when the clash erupted. It said
the army found cartridges from an Israel-made Uzi submachine gun at
the site and was searching for the settlers.
   Ron Nachman of Ariel said he sent an ambulance after hearing
about the shooting, adding, ``It is a very serious incident and
signifies a major change'' in relations between the settlers and
their Arab neighbors.
   Elsewhere in the occupied territories, nine Palestinians were
wounded in clashes with Israeli troops, including a 25-year-old man
badly hurt with a gunshot wound to the head, Arab hospital
officials said.

six years ago.
   Oozing lava overtook the 68th home Saturday, and on Sunday cut
off the only road to 21 surviving homes in the Royal Gardens
subdivision, said Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry
Kim. He said all residents were evacuated before the road was cut.
   For most of the past year, lava flowing to the Pacific Ocean had
been hidden from sight. It was confined inside tubes hidden beneath
the gray moonscape of hardened lava that cuts a two-mile-wide swath
through the otherwise lush Puna coastline on Hawaii Island.
   But the tubes became partially blocked earlier this month and
forced lava into the mostly rural subdivision, which has been
devastated since the eruption began in January 1983, scientists
said.
   Approximately 40 percent of Kilauea's daily lava output of
500,000 cubic meters was creeping through the lower portion of
Royal Gardens, which stretches up a slope overlooking the island's
southeast coast, said Reggie Okamura, a spokesman for the U.S.
Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.

   Populist Boris N. Yeltsin, a self-described
childhood hooligan, has struck on a formula for political survival:
turn hard talk about economic reform into popular acclaim.
   Before being resurrected again from political defeat Monday, he
used a recent interview to attack the leadership of his old mentor,
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for ``inconsistency,
indecisiveness, half-measures.''
   Earlier this year, Yeltsin won nearly 90 percent of the vote for
his Moscow seat in the new Congress of People's Deputies by
accusing the Communist elite of wallowing in luxury while Soviets
scour the black market for basic items like soap.
   The burly, rubbery-faced 58-year-old, who was ousted from the
ruling Politburo in 1987, made his political comeback in a surprise
turnaround Monday by winning a seat on the working legislature
known as the Supreme Soviet. He was initially rejected, but a new
lawmaker stepped down to make space for Yeltsin _ all with
Gorbachev's blessing.
   Boris N. Yeltsin is once again a force to be reckoned with.
   Not everyone holds him for a hero, though. Some Baltic
independence activists see him as a reformer _ but not necessarily
an ally.
   And conservative Communist Party leaders demanded an
investigation of him when Yeltsin called for consideration of
multiple parties.
   This is not the first time Yeltsin has sown mischief. A
self-declared troublemaker as a child, he lost a thumb and
forefinger playing with a hand grenade.
   Eventually, however, he showed a preference for the
rough-and-tumble of Soviet politics. He served as regional
Communist Party boss in his hometown of Sverdlovsk in the Ural
mountains before Gorbachev brought him to Moscow in 1985.
   As the capital's party chief, he quickly moved to center stage
by fighting party privileges and catching managers holding back
scarce consumer goods for special customers.
   Sarcastic and authoritarian, he demanded a crackdown on
corruption and criticized rampant nepotism. Once, he revealed that
70 percent of the students at a prestigious institute were children
of ranking officials.
   His initial setback came in October 1987, when he took aim at
Politburo conservative Yegor K. Ligachev and Gorbachev himself at a
party meeting.
   He demanded faster reforms and charged that Gorbachev, his
mentor, received ``intolerable'' glorification. Stung party leaders
promptly fired Yeltsin from both the Moscow party job and the
non-voting spot on the Politburo.
   Typically, a disgraced Politburo member becomes a
``non-person,'' vanishing forever from the Soviet political scene.
But Yeltsin resurfaced within a week as a deputy construction
minister and remained one of the party's top 250 leaders on the
policy-making Central Committee.
   Now, even his old nemesis Ligachev, who shook with laughter over
Yeltsin's initial defeat for a seat on the Supreme Soviet, has
changed his tune. Ligachev told reporters Monday that it was only
fair that Yeltsin gain a seat.

<HEAD>Testing Begins on Woman Who Spent 130 Days in Isolation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 27-year-old woman who spent a record 130 days
isolated in a New Mexico cave began undergoing a weeklong series of
tests Monday that could yield clues about the medical effects of
long-term space flight.
   Early indications are that Stefania Follini, an interior
decorator from Ancona, Italy, who volunteered for the experiment,
is faring well despite losing 17 pounds and showing signs of
lethargy and inattentiveness during her latter days in the
underground plexiglass home.
   ``At this point, all of the results have been normal. There is
nothing strange that we have noticed, not even simple anemia,''
said Dr. Andrea Galvagno, one of two Italian researchers in Houston
who have monitored her health.
   ``There is nothing at this point that would make me feel nervous
about her health,'' he said, adding that it is still too early to
tell what specific effects the long-term isolation had on her
immune system.
   Dr. Jon DeFrance, who is assisting in the research, said
previous isolation studies have shown ``a change in the immune
function whereby a person might become susceptible to certain types
of diseases.''
   ``Of course, this has rather profound implications for a space
flight,'' said DeFrance, an associate professor at Texas Medical
School in Houston.
   Testing this week also will include a skin sensitivity test at
the Johnson Space Center and a bone density examination at the
Baylor College of Medicine, researchers said.
   Ms. Follini, whose sense of time became so disoriented during
isolation that she emerged May 23 thinking the date was March 14,
said she is still having a hard time adjusting again to a 24-hour
day.
   She glanced constantly at her watch during an afternoon press
conference at HCA Gulf Pines Hospital.
   ``I keep looking at it because I still haven't found a real use
for this,'' she said through an interpreter, when questioned about
her frequent glances at the timepiece. ``I can also tell you that
every time I look at the watch, I'm surprised at how quickly time
goes by.''
   She said she also felt healthy and ``very rested'' after her
seclusion, despite losing weight and once going for three months
without a menstrual cycle. Subsequently, she had three in less than
three weeks.
   ``I didn't even feel that I was losing the weight,'' Ms. Follini
said, adding that her loss of a menstrual cycle did not concern her
``because I felt that it was not necessary for me'' under the
conditions.
   Montalbini Maurizio, a psychologist who is overseeing the
experiment, said that during a similar study in which he spent 210
days in isolation, he experienced a significant drop in the male
hormone testosterone because his body found no need to produce it.
   He also emerged with immune deficiencies that took eight months
to overcome, but ``did not even develop a common cold'' during that
time, Galvagno said.
   Previous subjects of isolation experiments by the non-profit
Italian research group, Pioneer Frontier Exploration and
Researches, have shown signs of depression, but Ms. Follini did
not, the doctors said.
   Some of the physical changes she experienced were likely related
to stress, doctors said, but Ms. Follini said she did not sense any
stress during her isolation, only some frustration.
   ``The situation for me was all new, so every time I was going to
do something it was a problem for me,'' she said, citing situations
in which she had to draw her own blood or place electrodes on her
body to monitor vital signs.
   Ms. Follini, who is 4 feet, 11 inches tall and weighed 90 pounds
after emerging from the cave last week, began wearing a heart and
blood-pressure monitor on a belt holster before going into
isolation and will continue to wear it for two more months.
   ``At this point, I'm used to it,'' she said. ``It's almost a
part of me.''

<HEAD>Vietnamese Boat People Make 40-day Voyage To Japan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A wooden boat only 77 feet long and carrying 107
Vietnamese refugees landed on an uninhabited island in southwestern
Japan Monday after a 40-day voyage, officials said.
   It was the first time since 1977 that a craft with Vietnamese
boat people reached Japan directly from Vietnam, the office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Japan said.
   It said more than 8,000 Vietnamese refugees have arrived in
Japan after being picked up by Japanese and non-Japanese ships
outside the country's territorial waters.
   In Singapore, a United Nations officials said 87 Vietnamese boat
people rescued by a Dutch ocean-going tug were being held aboard a
ship in international waters awaiting resettlement because
Singapore refused to accept them.
   An official of Japan's Maritime Safety Agency said 71 men, 22
women and 14 children were aboard the boat that reached Biryo
Island early Monday, and all of the refugees were reported to be in
satisfactory condition. Biryo Island is 48 miles west of Sasebo.
   The officials said the Vietnamese told investigators they left
their homeland on April 20 and their boat, 18 feet wide, had
drifted for the past week because of trouble with the diesel engine.
   At one point the refugees' boat was towed by a ship and the
ship's crew provided some rice, the Vietnamese said, but they were
not able to identify the ship, according to the official.
   The Vietnamese said they had fled Vietnam because of harsh
conditions and they wanted live in a ``peaceful place,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said it was not
known why the unidentified ship had not picked up the boat people.
   About 8,900 Vietnamese refugees had arrived in Japan since
communist forces defeated the U.S.-backed government in South
Vietnam in April 1975. Of those, 2,500 settled in Japan and the
remainder left for other countries including the United States,
Canada and Australia.
   The U.N. official in Singapore said the government refused to
allow the Dutch tug to land because it was not scheduled to call at
Singapore. He said the government asked the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees to send the refugees to another country.
   The tug Santania rescued the Vietnamese from a sinking boat in
the South China Sea on May 16 and arrived at Singapore May 21,
according to the official. He said the tug was en route from South
Korea to Saudi Arabia when it saved the refugees.
   ``Last Friday we hired a boat and had the refugees transferred
from the tug to a ship which is now lying in international
waters,'' he said. ``We hope to finalize formalities to send them,
most likely to the Philippines, during the next two weeks.''
   Singapore bars refugees unless other countries provide
guarantees that they will accept them within three months.

   Legislator Yossi Sarid told Parliament on
Monday that the PLO has conditionally accepted Israel's proposal
for elections in the occupied lands to choose delegates for peace
talks with Israel.
   No one in the Palestine Liberation Organization confirmed this
reported change in its position, nor was it confirmed by other
sources in Israel.
   Sarid's remarks came during a stormy Parliament session on a
speech last week by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III last
week. Baker asked Israel then to ``lay aside once and for all, the
unrealistic vision of a Greater Israel'' that would include the
occupied lands.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Baker harmed Israel and the
peace process when he publicly denounced Israeli policies in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. He noted that Baker broke a
long-standing tradition that the United States and Israel discuss
their differences privately.
   One facet of a peace plan advanced by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir is for elections in the occupied territories.
   On Monday, Sarid of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement, said:
   ``The PLO has already agreed to elections and passed this on to
Washington.''
   Israel views the PLO as a terrorist organization and refuses to
deal with it.
   Sarid said the PLO told U.S. officials it would agree to
elections under five conditions, including partial Israeli army
withdrawal and a U.S. pledge that it views the PLO as a partner in
the second stage of talks on a final settlement.
   The conditions appeared an effort at compromise.
   In the past the PLO has demanded complete Israeli army
withdrawal before elections. Shamir has ruled this out, but has
said that as part of an interim autonomy agreement, the army could
pull back from Arab population centers.
   If Sarid's report is accurate, it would also appear that the PLO
is trying to sidestep Israel's refusal to deal with the PLO by
insisting only on American, not Israeli recognition, and only at a
much later stage of the process.
   The other PLO conditions include international supervision of
elections, participation of Palestinians from Israeli-annexed east
Jerusalem, and immunity for candidates, said Sarid, a member of
Parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Arens said Monday in lashing out at Baker's speech, ``The image
of close relations helps the advancement of peace in the region.
It's important that the Arabs understand that these are the
relations between the United States and Israel. This image is also
important for Israel's deterrent power.
   ``I'm sure Baker didn't intend to harm Israel ... but sometimes
you hurt someone without intention.''
   Referring to media descriptions of Baker's speech as balanced,
Arens said: ``How can one of our allies take a balanced position
between us and our enemies, between us and those who attacked us
five times?''
   Arens suggested Baker harmed the peace process by emphasizing
U.S. and Israeli differences on a final settlement of the conflict.
   Washington insists Israel return some occupied land in such a
settlement. The right-wing Likud bloc to which Shamir and Arens
belong opposes all territorial compromise.
   ``I'm very sorry that Baker related to the character of the
final settlement. We are convinced, and I thought the United States
was also convinced that we have to concentrate on the interim
agreement,'' Arens said.
   He urged the United States ``not to raise the hopes of the Arabs
about the final settlement.''
   Under Israel's peace plan, Palestinians elected in the balloting
would negotiate an interim settlement of limited Palestinian
self-rule in the occupied lands.
   Arens' tough rhetoric appeared aimed, in part, to calm far-right
critics of the peace plan in Likud.
   Three influential Likud Cabinet ministers are waging a campaign
to have the plan rejected in a Likud Central Committee meeting
tentatively scheduled for June.
   Shamir, head of Likud, threatened to resign if the party rejects
his initiative. Shamir rules in a coalition with the left-leaning
Labor Party which backs the elections proposal.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell Monday in the West, hail pelted the upper Midwest and
showers dampened Indiana, Ohio and parts of Florida, but the rest
of the nation enjoyed fairly nice weather on Memorial Day.
   An upper level disturbance brought rain and snow to the Sierra
Nevada in northern California and parts of Nevada, and a snow
advisory was in effect for up to 4 inches of snow through Monday
afternoon.
   Thunderstorms that developed along a cold front in the upper
Midwest produced severe weather in North Dakota and Minnesota.
   Hail 1{ inches in diameter was reported at Forman, N.D., while
1-inch-wide hail fell at Havana and half-inch stones were recorded
at Mantador.
   Thunderstorms in Minnesota produced half-inch hail at Fergus
Falls along with an inch of rain in 30 minutes.
   And in central Minnesota, golf-ball-size hail was reported at
Staples and Motley, with even larger stones at St. Bonifacius.
   Showers also fell in Indiana, Ohio and parts of Florida.
   Cloudy skies with light rain and drizzle extended from the
northern Plains to the northern Pacific coast.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours ending 3 p.m. EDT
included an 1\ inch at Peru, Ind.; a third of an inch at South
Bend, Ind., and a quarter of an inch in Fort Wayne, Ind.
   Strong, southerly winds boosted temperatures into the 90s across
much of the southern and central Plains region. Readings were in
the 80s and lower 90s across the southeastern United States and in
the desert Southwest.
   Cooler temperatures prevailed north of a cold front in the
north-central United States, with early afternoon readings in the
40s and 50s in portions of Michigan. Readings were in the 30s and
40s in Montana.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Havre, Mont., to 98 at McCook, Neb.
   The nation's low Monday morning was 25 degrees at Lakeview, Ore.
   Tuesday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the northern and central High Plains through the
Great Lakes region, the northern Ohio Valley to northern New
England. Rain was forecast for the central Rockies and the northern
and central Plateau region.
   The outlook for the rest of the nation was fair to partly sunny
skies.
   Highs were expected in the 80s in the southwestern deserts, the
lower and middle Mississippi valleys, the southern and middle
Atlantic coast, and southern sections of New England and the Great
Lakes region; and the lower 90s in southeastern California, the
lower half of the Mississippi Valley, south-central Kansas and
portions of Texas.
   Highs were expected below 70 degrees through the northern Plains
to upper Michigan, with highs in the 50s from northeastern Nevada
through Montana to northern Minnesota.

<HEAD>Government Accuses U.S. of Aiding Opposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday accused the
United States and other Western nations of helping opposition
forces prepare for Poland's first democratic elections under
communist rule.
   ``The Polish government judges interference of some Western
figures and institutions in the electoral campaign of our country
as an unprecedented violation of Poland's sovereignty. This is an
insult to the national pride of Poles,'' said a government
statement.
   ``The Polish government appeals for an immediate halt of
interfering in the electoral campaign by some Western countries, in
any form,'' said the statement that was read on state television
and carried by the state-run news agency PAP.
   The statement also charged that some Western diplomats were
actively participating in opposition election meetings and
sometimes ``fulfilling instructive functions.''
   It said members of the public in the United States and other
countries were raising money for the opposition and supplying
printing machines for campaign efforts.
   The government claimed that Munich-based Radio Free Europe is
``conducting an electoral campaign for Solidarity for many hours a
day,'' and ``the American radio station, financed by the U.S.
government, is constantly instructing Poles for whom they should
vote and especially for whom they shouldn't vote.''
   Former Carter administration adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, who is
visiting Poland, was criticized for an interview he gave to the
opposition's election newspaper. He was quoted as saying that a
weak Solidarity showing would be a surprise and have unfavorable
consequences for Poland.
   ``This is an open and simply brutal attempt of influencing
results of elections in a foreign country,'' the statement said.
   Poles are to vote Sunday to fill seats in the 460-member Sejm
and the 100-seat Senate.
   Under the government's historic accord with the Solidarity-led
opposition, all seats in the Senate will be open to any group or
organization. In the Sejm, the opposition can seek 161 seats with
the rest reserved for the communists and their allies.
   Solidarity has endorsed one candidate for each of the 261 seats
it can seek.
   At a news conference in Warsaw, party Secretary Zygmunt
Czarzasty criticized Solidarity instructions that voters should
cross out all non-Solidarity candidates on Sunday.
   The balloting procedure is complicated. In order to vote yes for
one candidate a voter must cross out all the other names on the
ballot.
   Solidarity's campaign literature clearly explains the procedure,
but communist officials have protested that advocating that voters
cross out all non-Solidarity candidates is unfair.
   ``We say vote for the best and we never say, cross out these or
those,'' Czarzasty said.
   For the seats set aside for the party and its allies, no
Solidarity candidates are running. If more than 50 percent of the
voters cross out all the candidates on those ballots, no one would
be elected and some seats would simply be unfilled.
   In other developments, about 400 supporters of several banned
groups held a rally in Warsaw. Groups such as the Polish Socialist
Party-Democratic Revolution and the Polish Independence Party,
barred from the elections, advocate a boycott saying the elections
are not free because the communists are guaranteed a majority in
the Sejm.
   Protesters shouted ``Boycott elections!'' and ``Down with
communism!'' Police were present but no arrests were reported.
   Parliament passed a law pardoning political offenses committed
since the August 1980 agreements that initially legalized the
Solidarity trade union.
   PAP said the law pardons and erases from the record misdemeanors
and also fiscal offenses that were politically motivated in
connection with strikes and protest actions or violations of
military rules.
   Solidarity, the only free union movement in the Soviet bloc, was
suspended when martial law was imposed in December 1981 and
subsequently was outlawed by Parliament. It was legalized again in
April following lengthy negotiations that also set the rules for
Sunday's balloting.
   Thousands of union activists were arrested and many were fired
from their jobs during the crackdown under martial law that was
lifted about a year later.

<HEAD>Bulgarian President Blames Turkey For Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Todor Zhikvov blamed Turkey on
Monday for growing unrest by ethnic Turks in this country and urged
it to accept Moslems who want to emigrate.
   Reports said Bulgarian authorities imposed emergency measures to
stifle ethnic Turks who are resisting an assimilation campaign. The
president, speaking on television and radio, made no reference to
such measures.
   But he accused Turkey, as well as Western ``circles'' and radio
stations, of an anti-Bulgarian campaign.
   He also told Turkish authorities: ``Open your frontier to all
Bulgarian Moslems who want to go to Turkey for a short-term stay or
for permanent residence.''
   Even before riots mainly in northern Bulgaria a week ago, the
Sofia government began deporting ethnic Turks deemed to be
troublemakers or otherwise undesirable.
   An estimated 300 of them have been forced to flee, mostly to
Vienna, Austria, and Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Scores have been picked
up by Turkish airliners for resettlement in Turkey. More Turks were
arriving in Vienna and Belgrade on Monday, Turkish diplomats said.
   Turkish refugee sources in Belgrade said Monday that the
emergency measures in Bulgaria confine ethnic Turks around the
Black Sea port of Varna to their homes at night.
   They also said radio broadcasts from neighboring Turkey are
being jammed and all mosques in the area have been closed. Police
have forbidden more than two people from walking together in the
streets of the largely Turkish-populated towns, they said.
   The deportees declined to be identified for fear of reprisals
against relatives in Bulgaria.
   According to an official report, three people died in the recent
ethnic unrest in Bulgaria, but deportees have put the figure at up
to 30. The violence flared during demonstrations for restoration of
ethnic Turkish rights, according to diplomatic and exile sources.
   A nationwide drive, begun in 1984, forced the estimated 900,000
Bulgarian Turks to change their Moslem names to Slavic and
restricted their religious and civil rights, such as public use of
their language.
   The Bulgarian government does not recognize the Turkish
minority. It says the people targeted by the campaign are actually
Slavs who were converted to Islam during five centuries of Ottoman
occupation.
   Several Western nations have said they will raise the issue at a
35-nation human rights conference starting in Paris on Tuesday.

   Bob Hope celebrated his 86th birthday on
the road Monday _ actually on the Ventura Freeway, where he
dedicated a sign for an exit to Bob Hope Drive.
   Standing in a fluorescent orange vest and a hardhat, the
comedian dispensed free one-liners as Memorial Day motorists roared
by on one of California's busiest highways.
   ``Now I'm a star of stage, screen, television and traffic
jams,'' Hope quipped in a telephone interview a few minutes before
he left for the freeway, a short drive from his Toluca Lake home.
``My mother always wanted me to be a doctor or an off-ramp.''
   ``It's appropriate,'' he added in another one-liner prepared for
the California Department of Transportation event. ``What audiences
always liked best about me was my exit.''
   The name of a short street beside NBC Studios in Burbank was
changed to Bob Hope Drive a year ago. And for many years travelers
in the Palm Springs area have had a chance to exit Interstate 10 to
another Bob Hope Drive in Rancho Mirage.
   ``This is some day,'' said Hope. ``After all, they closed all
the banks and the schools.''
   But seriously, despite his age, Hope's current schedule seems as
heavy as when he traveled the globe entertaining U.S. servicemen in
World War II, the Korean conflict and Vietnam.
   He'll be in Salt Lake City for an Indian Education Services
fund-raising golf tourney Tuesday, and leave home again Thursday on
a three-week trip that will include appearances, benefits, stage
shows and charity golf tournaments in the Eastern United States.
   Hope said he occasionally can shoot an 18-hole score below his
age on the golf course. ``But when I played yesterday, I shot my
license plate number.''

   The U.N.'s World Food Program said Monday it needs
417,000 more tons of food to meet emergencies in 1989 and the
shortage might affect deliveries to refugees.
   ``Unless additional resources are forthcoming, the program may
be forced to stop responding to all but the most vital needs,''
Executive Director James Ingram said in a report to the
organization's governing council.
   Edouard Saouma, director-general of the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization, said the way food aid programs are
conducted should be reviewed.
   He said using cash rather than commodities in some cases would
allow the purchase of food on local markets.
   Speaking to the World Food Program's Committee on Food Aid
Policies and Programs, Saouma said developing countries wanted the
appraisal partly because new technology and reforms in agricultural
policy have created the possibility of using locally produced
staples in aid programs instead of imports.
   Ingram said in his report the shortage of emergency supplies
``could lead to a disruption in deliveries to refugees and an
inability to meet unexpected disasters.''
   He said the shortage included 142,000 tons needed for Afghan
refugees in Pakistan and Iran and 182,000 tons for victims drought
and crop failures in Africa.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Urge Opposition To Promote Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas asked the
political opposition Monday to help them arrange peace talks with
the new rightist government.
   The proposal was the fourth such overture since January. The
others have foundered because of what officials viewed as
unrealistic demands by the insurgents.
   The new offer said opposition parties should promote and sponsor
``dialogue until direct negotiation between the government and the
(rebel) FMLN is achieved.''
   The FMLN, or Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, made the
offer in a communique signed by two top commanders.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat who has
governed for five years, will transfer power Thursday to Alfredo
Cristiani of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or
Arena. He was elected in March.
   Despite their renewed call for talks, the rebels' communique
said, ``The installation of the Arena government means ... a
deepening and prolongation of war in El Salvador.''
   Moreover, the rebels made no concessions or major changes of
position from previous proposals.
   Cristiani had no immediate comment on the latest proposal. He
has said previously he is willing to talk to rebel representatives
but will not negotiate on power-sharing.
   Ricardo Alvarenga Valdivieso, president of Congress and Arena
director, reacted to the new proposal by telling reporters, ``There
are things that are done just so they will be rejected.''
   Among the demands, the rebels urged Arena to ensure the trial of
party founder and principal ideologue Roberto D'Aubuisson, a
cashiered army major accused of involvement in death squads and the
1980 slaying of Archbishop Monsignor Oscar Romero.
   It also demands that death squads be dismantled, that agrarian
reform be maintained, and that banks and sales of export crops be
nationalized.
   D'Aubuisson denies he ran death squads. The party says it has
nothing to do with such organizations.
   Cristiani says agrarian reform will not be rolled back, but he
says the private sector will have a dominant role in banking and
export.
   The guerrillas in turn promise not to kill Arena officials or
their family members or family members of military officers. They
also say they would stop blowing up utility poles in the city and
imposing nationwide road transport bans.
   More than 65,000 Salvadorans, mostly civilians, have been killed
in the civil war. The United States has supported the government.

   Tehran radio said Monday that Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is making satisfactory progress
after undergoing surgery to stop bleeding in the digestive system.
   Iranian television showed the 86-year-old Shiite Moslem patriach
being visited by relatives at a hospital. The surgery was performed
last Tuesday.
   The television announcer reported that Khomeini suffered a
slight heart complication on Saturday. It gave no details but said
the condition was ``relieved'' on Sunday.
   Iran's main opposition group, the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq,
said in a message to The Associated Press in Cyprus that Khomeini
had suffered a heart attack Saturday. The assertion could not be
independently verified.
   The Tehran radio broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said
Khomeini's digestive system is now functioning normally and he is
being served solid foods.
   Iranian television showed Khomeini in a hospital bed with his
son Ahmad sitting nearby. It also showd Ahmad Khomeini's young son
playing with a stethoscope and climbing onto the high hospital bed
to kiss his grandfather.
   Khomeini, receiving medication through an intravenous tube, was
propped up in the bed with a food tray in front of him.
   Relatives were shown coaxing him through each spoonful as he was
fed what appeared to be abgoosht, a soup consisting of the broth
from boiled meat and potatoes.
   Some dates and bread were on the tray, but the television did
not show Khomeini eating them.
   Khomeini's personal physician said after the operation in a
Tehran hospital that the revolutionary leader was in excellent
condition.
   Khomeini has been reported ailing since he suffered a heart
attack in 1986. He has rarely been seen outside his home in
Tehran's Jamaran suburb.
   Official reports had listed Khomeini's age at 89, but his
brother Pasandideh said after the operation that Khomeini is 86.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York said
Monday that his trip to Lebanon did not help the nine American
hostages and nine other foreigners held here and he hoped to return
to try again.
   The Roman Catholic archbishop appealed three times to
pro-Iranian kidnappers after arriving Saturday to be allowed to
visit the Americans. He received no response.
   At his final 30-minute news conference Monday at the Bkirki
monastry north of Beirut, O'Connor said in reply to questions that
he did not know if acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss was a Christian
or a Moslem and that he was unsure of army commander Gen. Michel
Aoun's political role.
   He also said he was unaware of the religion of Aoun, who heads a
Christian military Cabinet vying for authority against Hoss'
Cabinet.
   O'Connor was expected to leave Tuesday for Cyprus by army
helicopter and to stop in Rome before returning to New York. Police
in Cyprus on Monday uncovered a plot to shoot down helicopters
coming from the Christian enclave.
   The prelate said Monday that if he offended anyone by canceling
a scheduled visit to Moslem west Beirut, ``I apologize to them.''
   The cancellation Sunday drew angry statements from Hoss, head of
the mostly Moslem Cabinet in Lebanon's dual government, and other
Moslem leaders.
   O'Connor said the decision was made because he was told there
was fighting along the Green Line that separates the capital into
Christian and Moslem sectors.
   ``The information I was given was inaccurate. There clearly was
no special problem,'' O'Connor said. He refused to say who gave him
the wrong information.
   A civil war has raged in Lebanon for more than 14 years.
   O'Connor's visit was an attempt to refocus attention on the
plight of the 18 foreigners missing and believed held hostage in
Lebanon. The issue has been overshadowed by 11 weeks of fighting.
   Terry Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, was kidnapped on March 16, 1985, and is the
longest held hostage.
   O'Connor said Monday: ``My time is running out. I have not been
able to learn anything about you (hostages). I hope I'll come back
and continue trying.''
   He said he sought through ``various people who might know if
they could give any idea of where the hostages might be ... I have
been given no leads whatsoever, no understanding of where they
might be.''
   O'Connor's last hostage appeal was made in an interview with the
AP in which he said, ``If your captors will permit me to come to
see you wherever you are, if it's physically possible for me, I
will come.''
   He said of the furor over his canceled west Beirut visit:
   ``I'm sorry that people feel that way ... If there are those who
are offended by my visit, I apologize to them. It was impossible
for me to do the things I would like to do.''
   Earlier Monday, O'Connor spoke with Hoss by telephone for 30
minutes.
   ``Hoss gave his views on the situation, and I listened very
respectfully and he listened very respectfully to mine,'' O'Connor
said, adding, ``It's not for me to determine a solution for
Lebanon.''
   Hoss later left for Damascus for talks with Syrian leaders on
Arab efforts to end the Lebanese crisis. Syria has 40,000 soldiers
in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the league, and
has been involved in an artillery war with the Christians that
began March 8.
   When reporters told the cardinal Hoss was a Sunni Moslem,
O'Connor said, ``I did not know that.''
   O'Connor was guest of Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah
Sfeir in Lebanon. He met Aoun for 1{ hours Sunday at the bunker of
the shell-battered presidential palace in Baabda east of Beirut.
   O'Connor declared complete support for Aoun's demands that the
Syrian army withdraw from Lebanon.
   At least 359 people have been killed in the artillery duels
between the 20,000 Christian troopers and an alliance of the
Syrians and Druse militiamen, which started two days after Aoun's
forces blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem militias.
   An Arab League summit in Morocco last week urged warring
factions in Lebanon to ``strictly adhere'' to a truce the league
proclaimed May 11.
   Syrian artillery positions in west Beirut continued firing at
the Christian coast north of the capital Monday, trying to keep
Aoun from bringing in arms and supplies by sea. Police reported no
casualties.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The border between Egypt and Libya was
reopened Monday, Cairo's Middle East News Agency reported, but the
two countries have not restored diplomatic relations.
   The opening of the border followed a reconciliation meeting
between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi during last week's Arab summit conference in
Morocco.
   It is expected that direct air service between Cairo and the
Libyan capital of Tripoli will be restored.
   The agency said the border was reopened at 10 p.m., and
officials in the border towns of Saloum and Mersa Matrouh were
preparing to open the land route that is used primarily by
Egyptians working in Libya.
   More than 200,000 Egyptians work in Libya. During the years the
border was closed they had to travel between the two countries by
way of Greece or some other third-nation transfer point.
   Libya and virtually all other Arab countries severed diplomatic
relations with Egypt after the late President Anwar Sadat signed a
peace treaty with Israel in March 1979.
   Most of the countries restored relations in recent years, but
hard-line Libya and Syria, along with war-divided Lebanon, have not.
   During the summit, which marked Egypt's return to the Arab
League, Mubarak held talks with Gadhafi and Syrian President Hafez
Assad but none gave any indication of plans to resume diplomatic
relations.
   Relations between Egypt and Libya have been strained since 1972
when Sadat, who was assassinated by Moslem exremists in October
1981, rejected a bid by Gadhafi to merge the two countries.

   Americans on Monday remembered those who died for their country,
from wars long past to last month's explosion aboard the USS Iowa.
But many celebrated Memorial Day as the traditional start of
summer's sun and fun.
   ``I'm proud to be here. I wouldn't miss it. My son is gone 37
years and I've never missed a Memorial Day since I lost him,'' said
Emma Bosch, who was guest of honor at a parade in New York City.
Her 21-year-old son was killed in the Korean War.
   Hundreds of thousands of people hit the nation's beaches, and
while the weather cooperated over much of the country, it was
unseasonably cold in Montana, where Great Falls got 6 inches of
snow during the early morning.
   In a brief ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, a 20-member
military honor guard laid a wreath at the grave of President
Kennedy to mark what would have been his 72nd birthday. No members
of the slain president's family attended.
   Later that morning, across the hilltop from where Kennedy is
buried, Vice President Dan Quayle placed the presidential wreath at
the Tomb of the Unknowns. President Bush was at a NATO meeting in
Brussels.
   Among the honored dead were some of the most recent: the 47
sailors who died April 19 aboard the USS Iowa in an explosion
inside one of the battleship's huge gun turrets. President Bush had
designated Memorial Day as a national day of remembrance for the
sailors.
   One ceremony for the Iowa sailors was held aboard the
decommissioned cruiser USS Little Rock, which is anchored on Lake
Erie at Buffalo, N.Y.
   The victims' names were read and when they reached Nathaniel C.
Jones, 21, of the Buffalo suburb of Tonawanda, his mother, Georgian
Davis, threw a carnation into the water.
   In California, a Civil War cannon boomed in Los Angeles and
police motorcycles roared in a solemn cavalcade in Oakland to honor
that state's dead.
   At the Los Angeles National Cemetery, which marks its 100th
anniversary this year, a restored Civil War cannon was rolled out
to fire a shot for the first time in decades.
   Veterans in Westwood, Mass., visited the grave of Robert Steele,
the drummer boy who at the age of 13 joined in the 1775 Battle of
Bunker Hill with the Dedham militia.
   ``He fought through the entire Revolutionary War, and in 1825,
when they built the Bunker Hill monument, he beat his drum again
when they dedicated the monument,'' said Jim Sullivan, director of
veterans services for Westwood, a town of 13,000 where 83
Revolutionary War veterans are buried.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis attended a ceremony at the
National Cemetery in Beaufort, S.C., to rebury the remains of 19
black Union soldiers. They were buried in a military cemetery in
the Union camp that apparently was neglected and forgotten after
the Civil War, and were found two years ago during road
construction.
   Ten airmen who died when their bomber crashed 10 days before the
D-Day invasion in 1944 were honored at a new memorial near their
crash site outside South Hadley, Mass.
   The memorial ``is all we can hope for, a warm place where the
butterflies play high up on the mountaintop,'' said Frank Tencza,
who organized the weekend ceremony and helped locate the soldiers'
remaining family members; more than 70 relatives attended.
   In Baltimore, about 3,500 people attended the dedication of a
monument to Vietnam veterans.
   A vandal threw white paint on Philadelphia's Vietnam Veterans
Memorial during the night. Early Monday morning, veterans who had
heard news accounts about the incident showed up with paint thinner
and scrapers to clean the monument before the ceremonies.
   A nonmilitary Memorial Day ceremony in Edmond, Okla., was no
less emotional. People cried when 14 jets of water were turned on
in a fountain built at the Edmond Post Office to memorialize 14
postal workers killed by gunman Patrick Henry Sherrill on Aug. 20,
1986. Sherrill later took his own life.
   After, or instead of, memorials, people headed to the beach or
park, or stoked up barbecues, to welcome summer.
   At Six Flags Over Georgia, the crowds were larger than last
year, said Bob Maxwell, park public relations manager.
   In Virginia Beach, Va., retired Soviet Maj. Gen. Valentin
Larionov watched the beach fill up with sun worshipers.
   ``This is real democracy,'' commented Larionov, part of a Soviet
delegation visiting the area.

<HEAD>Japanese Court Says Patients Do Not Have Right to Know Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patients do not have the right to be fully informed
of their disease by their doctor, a Japanese court ruled Monday in
the case of a woman who was told only that she had gallstones
before she died of cancer.
   The woman's husband immediately dismissed the decision by Nagoya
District Court as ``ridiculous'' and pledged to appeal it. The
ruling would not take effect nationwide unless the Supreme Court
upheld it, and appeals often take 10 years to reach the high court.
   Kazuko Makino, a 50-year-old nurse, died in 1983 of gallbladder
and liver cancer. Her doctor, Etsuro Orito of the Nagoya Second Red
Cross Hospital, found a tumor in her gallbladder but kept that
information from her and her family.
   Although Orito recommended surgery, Mrs. Makino decided against
it, believing she had gallstones. The hospital told the court Orito
was unsure if the tumor was malignant and therefore had no
responsibility to tell her she had cancer.
   Her husband, Ichiro Makino, sued the hospital for $342,000 in
damages. He said his wife would have agreed to an operation if she
had known her true condition.
   However, the court in Nagoya, 170 miles west of Tokyo, ruled
Monday that it is up to a doctor's discretion how much information
to divulge. The court said it was the patient's fault she did not
undergo the operation.
   ``Although a doctor has responsibility to explain to patients
about their diseases, it is the doctor who decides when, to whom,
and to what extent the explanation should be made,'' Chief Judge
Kuniharu Ito said.
   Makino said he would appeal to Nagoya High Court.
   ``It is doctors' ethics that I have been fighting for,'' Makino
said in an interview. ``Why didn't Dr. Orito at least tell us the
problem may have been something more serious, instead of telling us
lies?''
   In Japan, doctors generally give patients little information
about their diseases and often do not even tell them what medicine
they are taking.
   Doctors frequently do not tell patients when they have cancer,
believing it would destroy their will to live. Many Japanese
believe cancer is incurable.
   During the prolonged deterioration of Emperor Hirohito, the
government refused to confirm widespread reports that he was
suffering from cancer despite intense worldwide interest in his
condition. It was only after the 87-year-old monarch died on Jan. 7
that officials confirmed he died of cancer.
   In a survey in April by the nationally circulated newspaper
Asahi Shimbun, 60 percent of healthy Japanese said they wanted to
be told if they had cancer. However, only 20 percent said they
would tell relatives with the disease.
   Cancer, the No. 1 cause of death in Japan since 1981, claimed
206,000 lives last year.
   Hiroshi Horie, a surgeon at the Kyoto Prefectural University of
Medicine Hospital, supported the court's ruling.
   ``I've seen many patients who got worse after learning they had
cancer,'' he said. ``We doctors try to do only what is best for
patients, and so we don't tell them directly. Of course, we tell
their family _ that's a must,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Tetsuo Kashiwagi, vice chairman of Osaka's Yodogawa Christian
Hospital, said doctors should be able to decide whether to tell
patients they have cancer, ``but they should respect patients'
right to decide what to do with their lives.''
   ``More doctors have come to tell patients the truth, and that's
the way it should be,'' he said.

   Four Neo-Nazi ``skinheads'' attacked a
couple they thought was Jewish and a black man who tried to help
them, and were pulling out baseball bats when police arrived,
officials said Monday.
   Bystanders applauded Sunday as police arrested William R.
Killackey, 21, of Yorba Linda; his sister Amy Killackey, 19, of
West Covina; Scott Wilson, 28, of West Covina; and Timothy Zaal,
25, of Glendora.
   The four were booked for investigation of assault and violation
of civil rights and were held in lieu of $50,000 bail each, said
police Sgt. John Ortega.
   ``There is zero tolerance in our city for any racially motivated
crime,'' Ortega said. ``We just will not tolerate that in our
city.''
   The three men and one woman apparently stopped just before 5
p.m. Sunday at a shopping center to buy beer, then began shouting
ethnic insults at the Jewish couple, who were loading groceries
into their car, Ortega said.
   The 30-year-old man was then kicked in the chest and knocked to
the ground, the sergeant said. The 28-year-old woman was beaten as
she tried to protect her 2-week-old son, Ortega said. The infant
was unharmed.
   The three adults were treated for bruises and scrapes at the
scene by paramedics, police said. They were not hospitalized.
   The victims, whose names were withheld by police, are of Middle
Eastern descent and speak with accents, but officers didn't ask if
they actually are Jewish, said Officer Edward Careaga, who
investigated the attack. Police said the family was from Glendora,
another eastern Los Angeles County city near La Verne.
   As a black man attempted to intervene, the four skinheads began
shouting racial insults at him, police said.``Once he came to their
aid, they even threw a shopping cart at him,'' Ortega said.
   The four, all of whom had shaved heads or close-cropped hair,
were pulling aluminum baseball bats from their cars as police
pulled up, Ortega said. They cooperated with the arresting officers
and were taken into custody about five minutes after the incident
began, he said.
   ``The reason they gave for stopping was that the officers were
white and they didn't want to fight white people,'' Ortega said.
   Bystanders in the parking lot cheered as the four were taken
away, the sergeant added.
   The alleged assailants thought the victims were Jewish, but the
couple wasn't wearing any religious garb or didn't have any other
outward indication that they were Jewish, the sergeant said.
   The self-described skinheads were carrying several cards,
including one from the Glendale-based American White Separatist
Group and one from the Placentia-based group White Power.

   Maverick communist Boris N. Yeltsin, defeated by
fellow deputies in a bid for the new Soviet legislature, was
suddenly handed a seat Monday and celebrated by leading a noisy
victory parade through central Moscow.
   In a parliamentary maneuver that had President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's blessing, a place was opened for the former Moscow
party boss when a winner in the elections to the full-time
legislature, the Supreme Soviet, resigned on condition that Yeltsin
take his place.
   An exuberant Yeltsin said the move indicated the Congress of
People's Deputies, which elected the members of the legislature,
``is gradually becoming more democratic. If it goes further along
this road, there is hope it will justify the hopes of the people.''
   A roaring and ecstatic mass of supporters surged upon Yeltsin
after he left the Congress. Well-wishers hung from trees and tossed
red roses.
   Yeltsin, smiling broadly, led a spontaneous one-hour march from
the Kremlin along Gorky Street to Pushkin Square, where about 5,000
people gathered. Women kissed him and men shook his hand.
   ``All the people are with you!,'' one man yelled.
   Yeltsin thanked the throng through a megaphone and ended the
rally with hands held high in a gesture of victory.
   Also on Monday, Gorbachev pushed his choice for vice president _
Anatoly I. Lukyanov _ through the Congress, but not before the
deputies subjected the little-known schoolmate of Gorbachev's to
tough questioning on his views and fitness for the job.
   The 2,250-seat Congress, empowered to elect the national
president from among its own members and to confirm the president's
choice of vice president, let Omsk University law professor Alexei
I. Kazannik vacate his spot in the bicameral Supreme Soviet in
order to have Yeltsin take his place.
   The decision, reached in minutes without a direct vote on
Yeltsin's candidacy, defused a tense situation that developed when
the outspoken opponent of official privilege finished last on a
list of 12 candidates for 11 Russian federation seats in the
legislature's Soviet of Nationalities in results announced Saturday.
   Tens of thousands of Muscovites chanting ``Shame!'' rallied
Sunday in a stadium parking lot to protest the defeat of Yeltsin
and other outspoken Moscow progressives running for the legislature.
   Leaflets circulated through the crowd proposed a one-hour strike
Thursday if Yeltsin were not named to some high post by the
Congress. State-run TV said Sunday a poll found 49 percent of
Soviets surveyed were unhappy with how the elections had been run.
   Yeltsin, the top vote-getter in March's popular elections for
the Congress, received 1,185 votes from fellow deputies for a seat
in the Supreme Soviet, while 964 voted against him. But he was
defeated by 11 other candidates, including Kazannik, who got more
votes than Yeltsin.
   Kazannik, a law professor, took the podium in the nationally
televised proceedings to offer to renounce his seat on condition
Yeltsin replace him without another round of voting.
   He said he could not return to Omsk as a legislator because the
Congress had failed to elect many prominent scientists and
politicians, including Yeltsin. ``I would be ashamed to face my
voters,'' said Kazannik, who is not a member of the Communist Party.
   Only a few deputies voted against a proposal by Victor Palm of
Estonia to allow Kazannik's resignation and his replacement by the
burly, white-haired Yeltsin, 58.
   ``Inasmuch as Comrade Yeltsin received a majority of the vote,
the open place can be filled by him,'' Gorbachev ruled from the
dais. ``Naturally, it does not require a repeat vote.''
   Gorbachev told Kazannik the Congress ``welcomed his initiative.''
   Yeltsin, stripped of his Moscow and Politburo posts after an
October 1987 speech criticizing the slow place of Gorbachev's
reforms, emerged from the Congress hall beaming with Kazannik at
his side.
   He said Muscovites, who gave him 89 percent of the vote in a
two-way race in March, would be ``partially satisfied.''
   On the march to Pushkin Square, a city bus stopped, and dozens
of passengers got off to join in.
   One Yeltsin supporter, Anna S. Sabalova, her eyes wet with
tears, declared joyfully: ``We knew he was a honest person. We knew
he was elected by millions, but that just a few in the Congress
held him back.''
   Even Yegor K. Ligachev, a Politburo member accused by Yeltsin of
impeding Gorbachev's drive for perestroika, praised the decision,
telling reporters: ``It was democratic'' and the right thing to do.
   Earlier Monday, Lukyanov underwent nearly four hours of
meandering questioning in which he was asked to explain his record
and views on issues ranging from fighting crime to the 1939
German-Soviet treaty that deeded control of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuanian to the Kremlin.
   Gorbachev allowed the protracted questioning of Lukyanov, who
was first elected vice president by the Supreme Soviet in October,
but made it clear from the outset he wanted his handpicked deputy
confirmed without competing nominations from the floor.
   Gorbachev had tried for a vote on Lukyanov Saturday night but
gave in to loud objections from weary deputies who wanted more
discussion.
   The second time around, Gorbachev got what he wanted. Of the
2,250 deputies, only human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and
178 others voted against Lukyanov in a show of hands. There were
137 abstentions.
   Lukyanov, a student with Gorbachev at Moscow State University's
law school in the 1950s, has spent his career in the party and
government bureaucracy.
   Lukyanov takes over with other deputy chairmen of the Presidium
of the Supreme Soviet if the president cannot perform his duties.
He has no other constitutional duties but may be given assignments
by the president.

   Politburo member Imre Pozsgay said the
ruling Communist Party could give way to a party based on Western
Europe's social democratic principles, Radio Free Europe reported.
   Pozsgay, considered the leading reformer in Hungary's Communist
Party, made the statement in an interview broadcast this weekend by
the radio's Hungarian program.
   Munich-based Radio Free Europe is a U.S.-financed network that
beams broadcasts to Soviet-bloc nations.
   Radio Free Europe provided English excerpts of the interview
that it said was conducted in Hungarian by one of the station's
correspondents who is based in Budapest. In March Hungary became
the first Warsaw Pact country to accredit a Radio Free Europe
journalist.
   The transcript provided to news organizations said Pozsgay was
asked if he would accept the position as the leader of a reform
Communist Party and quoted him as replying:
   ``I can say that such a party could not be called
reform-communist. That party would belong to the conceptual
framework of European socialism ....
   ``Only a party capable of adapting to the people and to the
European ideas could be effective and successful.''
   Pozsgay added, ``It would not be based on the communist
tradition of clinging to abstract ideas but rather on the type of
European socialist ideas that characterize the Italian or French
socialist parties or the Swedish, Austrian or West German social
democratic parties.''
   He was asked if communism is in a crisis and said, according to
the excerpts: ``This is a crisis of Stalinism. It has become quite
certain that Stalinism cannot be reformed because it has been a
failure, because it has become unsuitable for giving people the
experience and feeling of freedom.''
   He said Stalinism ``with its inclination for terror and violence
should be cleared away from the path because it does not correspond
either to socialism or to European political culture or to the
everyday needs of the people.''
   Pozsgay was referring to the years of rule by the late Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin.
   Hungary's Communist Party is undergoing major changes because of
the reform movement within the party.
   In February the party's Central Committee decided to accept
political pluralism.
   Legislative elections scheduled for 1990 will be the first since
the communist takeover in 1948 under a law that legalizes other
parties and will allow them to participate in the elections.

   Talk-show host Oprah Winfrey says her friends
are now her ``chosen family'' because she was abandoned by her
blood relatives and abused as a child.
   In an interview in next week's TV Guide magazine, Winfrey said
she was a child of a broken home, was shuttled from caretaker to
caretaker, raped by a distant cousin at age 9 and repeatedly
sexually abused by family friends.
   ``I'm generous to people I know and to some people that I don't
know, if I feel that their cause or their purpose has true meaning,
and that they will benefit from the money,'' she said.
   The TV talk-show host said she now surrounds herself with those
who have stood by her, including Connecticut TV anchorwoman Gayle
King Bumpers; composer-producer Quincy Jones, her oldest friend;
Arleen Weiner, from her days on Baltimore television; and several
of those involved with Ms. Winfrey's big-screen debut, ``The Color
Purple.''
   Also in that group are several young women who work for ``The
Oprah Winfrey Show.'' For Christmas last year, Ms. Winfrey flew
four young female producers from Chicago to New York for a massive
shopping spree, spending thousands of dollars in a couple of hours.

   President Bush challenged Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday to agree to deep American and Soviet
troop withdrawals from Europe, and NATO ministers later worked out
a compromise on missile negotiations that had threatened to divide
the Western alliance.
   NATO leaders welcomed Bush's plan for across-the-board
reductions in conventional forces, which would limit the United
States and the Soviet Union to 275,000 troops each in Europe. Bush
said he wants the proposal put on the fast track for treaty talks
in Vienna.
   The NATO ministers worked past midnight to forge their
compromise on the short-range missile question.
   A senior U.S. official said it provides for U.S.-Soviet
negotiations to reduce, but not eliminate, the battlefield nuclear
weapons in both the NATO and Warsaw alliances. The short-range
nuclear cutbacks would be linked to the East-West talks in Vienna
to reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other conventional weapons.
   The official stressed the negotiations on missiles could not
begin, however, until an accord was reached to reduce those
conventional forces and the two alliances had actually started to
carry out those cutbacks.
   And the nuclear cutbacks could not start until the conventional
cuts were finished, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   This represented a partial victory both for West German and the
United States, whose division over the missile issue threatened the
unity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the two-day
40th anniversary summit itself.
   The United States won a major concession from Bonn in that the
communique is to call for partial reductions in the short-range
missiles _ but not their total elimination. Bush said earlier he
would never agree to eliminate all battlefield nuclear missiles
from Europe.
   Bush said he hoped NATO and the Warsaw Pact could work out a
treaty in six months to a year and implement it by 1992 or 1993.
   If that blueprint is followed in Vienna, the missiles, with a
range of up to 310 miles, would not be reduced for three or four
years.
   ``It worked out very well from our point of view,'' the official
told the Associated Press.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Ministers
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, for their part, won U.S. acceptance of the
proposition that there be negotiations with the Soviets to reduce
the weapons.
   The draft, which still requires the approval of Bush, Kohl and
the 14 other Allied leaders, straddles another contentious issue by
calling for keeping the missiles up to date, but not specifically
saying when they should be modernized.
   The United States and Britain wanted to more than triple the
range of 88 U.S.-built Lance launchers to just under 300 miles,
while the West Germans opposed making the weapons more powerful.
The official said the British, the most ardent supporters of a
missile deterrent to Soviet attack, still had some ``reservations''
about the tentative accord, but he gave no details.
   A British foreign ministry spokesman called it ``a text close to
an agreement.'' Genscher told reporters early Tuesday, ``It has to
be confirmed by the prime ministers, but it includes the
comprehensive concept and short-range forces negotiations.''
   Jurgen Chrobog, a West German spokesman, called it an agreement
``with a reservation'' by the British. The British spokesman, who
asked not to be identified, refused to comment on that.
   The ministers cancelled a formal dinner and met until 1 a.m.
Brussels time (7 p.m. EDT) before producing language Chrobog said
the Germans were ``very satisfied'' with.
   Earlier, Bush called his own proposals ``bold'' and said he
wanted to put Gorbachev's initiatives ``to the test.''
   Having dismissed some of the Soviet leader's measures as showy
but insubstantial, Bush said to Moscow: ``We're out there now with
a proposal that the United States puts forward, and that has
widespread alliance support. Now test it. How serious are you? Do
you really want to reduce the imbalances that exist in all these
categories, or do we want rhetoric?''
   Bush sent a letter to Gorbachev on Sunday outlining the proposal
and he told reporters he would make Secretary of State James A.
Baker III available for talks with the Soviet leader or Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to be held ``the sooner the
better.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Bush's
conventional weapons plan ``transformed the summit.'' Kohl
congratulated Bush for a ``far-sighted'' proposal on non-nuclear
forces.
   At the end of the afternoon working session, officials from
various countries said the leaders had adopted the Bush initiative
in principle and would endorse it in their final statement on
Tuesday.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's proposal, accepted by
the leaders, calls for NATO experts to consider the Bush offer for
60 to 90 days and work out a detailed negotiating position before
putting it before the Warsaw Pact in negotiations in Vienna.
   There was no formal response from the Soviet government but the
Soviet news agency Tass issued a brief dispatch saying ``the new
proposals were made by Washington after the Bush administration
came under serious criticism from the public for the lack of any
disarmament initiatives at a time when the Soviet Union has
launched a `peace offensive.'''
   With his proposal, Bush deflected attention from the differences
within the alliance.
   He said his plan involves a 20 percent cutback in U.S. combat
troops. It would reduce overall U.S. troop strength in Europe by
about 10 percent. There are about 150,000 U.S. combat troops in
Europe and more than 150,000 support forces.
   The Soviets have an estimated 625,000 troops in Eastern and
Central Europe. Gorbachev has already offered to cut down to
350,000 and proposed equal ceilings of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces
of 1.35 million.
   To reach 275,000, the Soviets would have to cut 350,000, or
about 57 percent.
   Bush also challenged the Soviets to negotiate cutbacks in combat
aircraft as well as assault and attack helicopters so that the two
alliances have ceilings 15 percent below NATO's current level, or
about 5,440 for each side. This could result in a wrangle over the
definition of Soviet planes, some of which Moscow describes as
defensive.
   He also urged the Soviets to formalize a proposal by Gorbachev
earlier this month for ceilings of 20,000 on tanks, 28,000 on
armored troop carries, and 16,500 to 24,000 for artillery pieces,
depending on how the weapons are defined.
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact opened negotiations in Vienna in March
to reduce tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear arsenals across
the expanse of Europe -- from the Atlantic Ocean in the West to the
Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union in the East.
   Gorbachev had set a target date of 1997. Bush, doing the Soviet
leader one better, said the reductions should be implemented by
1992 or 1993.
   By contrast, 14 years of Vienna-based negotiations over
reductions in Central Europe alone were abandoned last year with no
results.
   On the economic front, Bush said the United States is now
willing to cancel a blanket ban on transfers of high technology to
the Soviet Union. The sanction was imposed after the Red Army
invaded Afghanistan in December 1979. The last Soviet troops were
withdrawn in February.

<HEAD>James Dean's Hometown Trying To Save School Where He Got His Star</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRMOUNT, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The town where James Dean first sported
his trademark scowl still holds sharp memories for the actor's old
friends, who want to restore the abandoned high school where he
made his stage debut.
   So, fittingly enough, they're trying to raise money for the
91-year-old brick building with a 1950s-style sock hop and
cruise-in for hot rods.
   The school's ceiling is falling and the paint is peeling, but in
the gym Saturday night, the numbers on the scoreboard were shining
1949 for the year of Dean's high school graduation and 1955 for the
year he died in an automobile accident.
   ``This is kind of a do-or-die situation,'' said resident Ronald
Idlewine,'' who helps run the Madison-Grant Youth Basketball
League, which bought the school for $10 in 1986. ``Sure would be a
loss to see this stage go.
   ``Our first priority is to keep (the school) from falling down,
and to get that roof fixed,'' he said.
   Idlewine led visitors to the auditorium and to Adeline Nall's
speech room, where Dean learned how to project his voice, find
emotion in a line of script _ and to act.
   Ms. Nall, now 82, showed people around the room.
   ``This corner is James Dean's corner,'' she said. ``This is the
corner where he'd go whenever he came back to Fairmount. This was
after he was making movies. This corner has a lot of meaning for
me. He'd stand there waiting for class to end. ... Once he lit up a
cigarette.''
   Bob Pulley, who runs the Fairmount Historical Museum down the
street, remembered sharing the playbill with Dean in one of Ms.
Nall's productions.
   In 1948, Dean was a lead character in ``Our Hearts Were Young
and Gay,'' a comedy about a jaunt by two coeds aboard an ocean
liner to Europe. Pulley had a bit part as a steward.
   A year later, Dean wouldn't miss an opportunity to stand on his
school's stage. On Halloween, he dressed up like Frankenstein in a
spoof called ``Goon With The Wind.'' He was in the senior play,
``You Can't Take It With You.''
   And he placed first in the state speech contest with his
presentation of ``The Madman'' by Charles Dickens. It was sixth in
the national contest in Longmont, Colo.
   After graduation, Dean left Fairmount and headed for California,
where he made three movies over the next six years, ``Rebel Without
A Cause,'' ``Giant,'' and ``East of Eden.'' His death in a car
crash at the age of 24 gave him a lasting, almost mythic status as
a symbol of brooding youth.

   The audience at American Ballet Theater's
performance Monday was treated to the local premiere of dancer
Clark Tippet's prettily formal ``Rigaudon.''
   The title means a lively dance, done with a jumping step,
popular in the 17th and 18th centuries.
   Tippet used 20th century music, Benjamin Britten's 20-minute
``Simple Symphony for Strings,'' for his fourth ballet created for
the company.
   ``Rigaudon'' begins with seven couples, dancing in a sprightly
but courtly manner. When the group dwindles to three couples, then
two men and a woman, the two men dance together away from the woman
and she, coyly, dances to catch up.
   In the second movement, which Britten called ``Playful
Pizzicato,'' Tippet is inventive and amusing. Again he has two men
and a woman on stage. One man kneels; the other jumps across him,
putting a foot lightly down on his shoulder.
   As the men, John Gardner and Robert Wallace, show off dance
steps for each other, Deirdre Carberry exits unnoticed. They do
notice something besides themselves _ to the amusement of the
audience _ when they are suddenly circled by three women.
   Two threesomes dance the third movement, which Britten called
``Sentimental Saraband.'' Two men lift a ballerina in various
elegant postures. The other threesome joins hands and dances
briskly into a variety of triangles and ways for one to peer
through a ``window'' of entwined arms.
   All dancers took part in the Britten's first movement,
``Boisterous Bourree,'' and again in the brief ``Frolicsome
Finale.'' Charles Barker conducted. ``Rigaudon'' had its premiere
in February in Miami Beach. It was underwritten in part by the
Miami Premiere Society and the Equitable Foundation. It also
received commissioning funds from the New York State Council on the
Arts.
   The evening continued with ``Duets,'' choreographed by Merce
Cunningham, ``The Garden of Villandry,'' new to the company this
season, and ``Gaite Parisienne,'' the hit of a season ago.

   Kendall L. Truitt, the sailor linked by
reports to the investigation of the USS Iowa disaster, said Monday
he wants the Navy to apologize for leaking information implicating
him in the fatal blast.
   ``I'd like to see a formal apology _ from an identified Navy
spokesman,'' Truitt said shortly after a visit to the battleship at
Norfolk Naval Base to collect his belongings for a transfer to
Mayport, Fla.
   ``I'm sure this will hurt me in the future and certainly now.
Life will never be the same, I guess, but I'll try to get it back
as close as possible,'' said Truitt, who was accompanied by his
wife, Carole, and his attorney, Ellis Rubin of Miami.
   Rubin said he has asked Rep. Glenn Poshard, D-Ill., to
investigate the Navy's handling of its probe as it relates to
Truitt, a 21-year-old gunner's mate 3rd class who is a native of
Illinois.
   ``There has been tremendous publicity impugning this young
man,'' Poshard said in a telephone interview. ``Somebody had to
give the news media this information. ... If this boy is not
guilty, how is he ever going to recover from this thing? It doesn't
seem appropriate to try someone before the facts are in or in the
press.''
   Accidental causes have not been ruled out, but investigators
have reported finding no evidence of a mechanical or electrical
problem in the April 19 explosion that ripped the ship's No. 2 gun
turret, killing 47 men.
   In recent weeks, news reports based on unnamed sources have said
investigators were exploring the relationship between Truitt and
Gunner's Mate Clayton M. Hartwig, 25, who died in the explosion.
   The Navy has never officially named either man as being under
investigation, and Truitt has repeatedly denied being involved with
the blast.
   The New York Times reported Monday that investigators now feel
it is unlikely Truitt set off the explosion to kill Hartwig, who
had named Truitt as beneficiary on a $100,000 insurance policy. But
they say it is possible that Hartwig caused the blast to commit
suicide.
   Rubin said he was angry with the Navy for hustling his client on
and off the ship Monday with no opportunity to visit with friends
or pay his respects to fallen comrades.
   ``On this Memorial Day, Kendall Truitt and his wife Carole came
to pay homage to his shipmates who were lost,'' Rubin said. ``He
was not able to do that.''
   Mrs. Truitt also said she also wants an apology from the Navy.
   ``It would be nice to see them apologize for what they have done
to my husband,'' she said. Even if it might not fix the damage, she
said, ``it would be a start.''
   A Navy spokesman, noting the holiday, said the Navy would not
comment.

<TEXT>
   President Raul Alfonsin declared a 30-day
national state of siege Monday night in an effort to stem a week of
looting touched off by economic chaos.
   During the day, thousands of looters rampaged through Buenos
Aires suburbs and Rosario, the country's third largest city. Many
were women and children trying to steal food from supermarkets.
   Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse mobs in
Rosario. One man was shot and killed, and at least 36 people were
wounded, police said.
   At least five policemen were beaten or injured by stones.
   About 600 looters were arrested in Rosario and 268 in
working-class suburbs of the capital, police said.
   The looting followed soaring inflation, rising unemployment, a
devalued currency, shrunken wages and national elections on May 14
that voted out the governing Radical Civil Union party.
   President-elect Carlos Menem, a Peronist, is scheduled to take
office Dec. 10.
   Menem quickly backed the state of seige. ``It's possible that
what happened in Rosario could be repeated ... in other places,''
he warned.
   He blamed unspecified agitators for the violence in Rosario.
   All constitutional liberties were suspended in the state of
siege, which takes effect immediately but must later be approved by
Congress. It was announced by presidential press secretary Jose
Ignacio Lopez.
   Both houses of Congress will review the action on Tuesday.
   Alfonsin also had declared a state of siege in June 1985 after a
wave of bombings blamed on right-wing extremists said to be out to
topple the government.
   Gov. Victor Reviglio of Santa Fe Province declared a state of
emergency in Rosario. Stores closed early, students were sent home
and classes were suspended. Nighttime entertainment was canceled.
Residents were told to stay indoors.
   Most of Argentina remained calm, however.
   Sackings of stores and clashes began in several cities last
Tuesday stemming from an economic crisis that began February.
   More than 120 food and clothing stores in seven cities and towns
have been raided. Homemade gasoline bombs were seized and about 870
people were arrested even before the latest flareup. The previous
clashes left at least 10 people injured by rubber bullets or tear
gas fired by police.
   Government officials blamed leftist agitators. They said looting
parties appeared to be organized, police communications were
disrupted by jamming signals, and carloads of young men were seen
carrying sawed-off shotguns.
   ``Without doubt, they are elements of the extreme left,'' Sante
Fe provincial minister Alberto Didier told the independent news
agency Diarios y Noticias.
   Spokesmen for the Communist Party and other leftist groups
blamed failed government economic policy.
   ``The reality is being demonstrated that hundreds of thousands
of people don't have anything to give their children to eat,'' said
national deputy Luis Zamora of the Movement toward Socialism.
   Pablo Davola, whose Rosario store was looted, agreed.
   ``I had a shotgun and prepared a system to electrify the doors,
but there were many people I knew, people from the neighborhood who
used to come and buy things. I didn't know what to do,'' he told
the independent news agency Noticias Argentinas.
   Economists and politicians say lame-duck President Alfonsin is
in a poor position to implement a recovery program he announced
Sunday night.
   Similar situations have led to military coups six times since
1930. Gen. Gen. Francisco Gassino, the army chief of staff, said in
a speech to soldiers Monday, ``We are not disposed to ... repeat
errors, although the gravity of the situation troubles our
spirits.''
   Since February, the austral currency has lost more than 90
percent of its value against the dollar. Inflation this month alone
may exceed 70 percent, which would be an annual rate of 58,162
percent.
   A Central Bank announcement said earlier Monday banks and
foreign exchange houses that were closed or restricted May 22 would
resume normal operations Tuesday.
   Alfonsin sent Congress tax and spending measures aimed at
stabilizing the economy. Other measures he mentioned in a
nationwide address Sunday night took effect by decree, including
free subway passes for students and senior citizens.
   He pledged to reduce the budget deficit by cutting spending on
capital projects, increasing export taxes and enforcing income tax
laws, raising fees for public services and selling state-owned
radio and television stations.
   He also promised to enforce price guidelines.
   Real wages have fallen by 30 percent since January, according to
the Latin America Research Foundation, and are at the lowest level
since Alfonsin took office in December 1983.

   Some of the 270 residents forced
to flee after a pipeline explosion killed two people began
returning to their devastated neighborhood Monday but were warned:
``Enter at your own risk.''
   Many other residents were reluctant to return to the grim site,
where two weeks earlier a runaway train derailed, killing three
people and demolishing a row of homes.
   Investigators are focusing on the possibility that the train
wreck damaged the pressurized pipeline, ultimately causing the
explosion.
   ``I have a handicapped child. How can we live in a home where we
can't guarantee his safety ... or our own for that matter?,'' said
Ed Cisneros, 46.
   About 30 of the approximately 170 families evacuated, totaling
some 270 people, were given permission to return home Monday,
police Officer John Montecino said. By late Monday, only 13 of the
30 families returned to the stricken area.
   Those who did were met by signs posted throughout the
neighborhood warning: ``Enter at your own risk, City of San
Bernardino.''
   Also Monday, city officials and owners of the 14-inch pipeline,
which exploded last Thursday, negotiated conditions to reopen the
line.
   Calnev Pipe Line Co.'s parent company announced over the weekend
the damaged pipeline would be rebuilt under tougher standards, but
would remain in the same location.
   Representatives of the pipeline owner, Chicago-based GATX
Terminals Inc., met for two hours Monday with Southern Pacific
railroad officials and city negotiators, said City Attorney James
Penman.
   ``We basically explained that we want the line moved west of the
railroad tracks'' and away from the houses that were destroyed or
endangered, Penman said.
   The pipeline owners have balked at moving the line, saying such
it would be shut down for too long.
   ``The pipeline is very critical to the national defense
system,'' said Robert Claypoole, president of GATX Terminals. He
said fuel from the line flows to Air Force bases in California and
Nevada.
   U.S. District Judge David Williams signed a temporary
restraining order barring the city from interfering with
replacement of the line, which carries gasoline from Southern
California to Las Vegas. Meanwhile, gasoline is being trucked to
the desert gaming resort city.
   Penman said the city would go to San Bernardino Superior Court
on Tuesday, seeking a temporary restraining order of its own to
keep Calnev from reopening the line.
   Calnev officials declared the pipeline safe following the train
wreck, and Claypoole said the refurbished line would be ``extremely
safe.''

<HEAD>Diving Instructor Pulls Man From Submerged Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A diving instructor on a tourist-jammed
lake gave a real-life lesson in rescue skills when he repeatedly
plunged into 25 feet of water to save the pilot of a small plane
that crashed minutes before.
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimated that up to 165,000
people were on Bull Shoals Lake near the Missouri border when the
incident occurred during the Memorial Day weekend, but no other
injuries were reported.
   Scores of witnesses saw the single-engine plane crash Sunday
afternoon. The diving instructor, John Van Der Voorn, 42, with no
gear other than a borrowed diving mask, went down three times
before pulling Mark Seemeyer, 35, out of the cockpit of the plane.
   ``I teach a specialty rescue class,'' Van Der Voorn said Monday
as he and his wife packed to return home. ``I did exactly what I
taught. I never thought I would use it.''
   Seemeyer, of Fenton, Mo., was upgraded from critical to stable
condition Monday, according to a nursing supervisor at Cox South
Hospital in Springfield, Mo.
   A passenger in the plane, Mike Kuhn, 33, of Sunset Hills, Mo.,
floated to the top after the crash, but Seemeyer, who was
unconscious, was buckled into his seat, Van Der Voorn said.
   Kuhn was also in stable condition Monday night, the spokeswoman
said.
   Van Der Voorn, who was supervising about 25 students on a diving
trip sponsored by his shop in Morton, Ill., said he was in a cove
``on a knee board ready to ski'' when the plane went down about 300
yards behind him.
   He said he heard a boom and looked behind him just in time to
see the plane plummet into the water. Van Der Voorn said he climbed
quickly into the ski boat and was at the crash site within two
minutes.
   ``My wife and I dove in,'' Van Der Voorn said.
   ``The first time I couldn't get down because I had a wet suit on
and I was too buoyant,'' Van Der Voorn said. ``On the second dive,
I found the man unconscious, leaning forward. I found a seatbelt
around his knees,'' he said.
   Van Der Voorn said he got the seatbelt off and he thought an
unidentified diver who had joined in the effort was pulling
Seemeyer up.
   ``When I got to the top he said he didn't have him, that he
couldn't hold his breath that long, so I went back down,'' he said.
   By then, Seemeyer had settled back into the seat. ``I got him
and pulled him up,'' the diver said. He immediately began giving
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
   ``That diver happened to be at the right place at the right
time,'' said Rick McCloskey, chief of a sheriff's diving team that
patrols the lake. ``If it wasn't for him, the man would have been
dead at the scene.''

   Student pro-democracy protesters split today on
whether to press on with their three-week occupation of central
Tiananmen Square, grappling over how to face the anticipated
conservative backlash.
   Hardliners who have seized the upper hand in the government have
moved relentlessly in recent days toward snuffing out the
6-week-old movement.
   Workers were reportedly being fined for taking part in
demonstrations _ few were seen in a march Sunday by about 80,000
people, mostly students _ and troops called under martial law were
said to have occupied Beijing's biggest steel plant.
   The state-run press, which only a week ago was filled with heady
reports of the democratic protests, was churning out propaganda
material.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today pushed the new congress
for quick confirmation of his choice for vice president, but there
were signs of widespread dissatisfaction with how conservatives
were dominating the session.
   The session reconvened a day after tens of thousands of people
rallied in Moscow to protest the defeat of prominent reform-minded
deputies in their bids for seats in the standing legislature, or
Supreme Soviet.
   The protesters charged that Saturday's vote by members of the
Congress of People's Deputies was undemocratic, and television news
said a poll found half the people surveyed to be dissatisfied with
how it was held.
   Gorbachev, who tried to get the congress to confirm his vice
presidential nominee Saturday night but gave in to loud objections
from weary deputies, opened today's session saying he wanted to
``settle the question right away'' without bogging down in
procedural matters.

   With House Speaker Jim Wright and one of his
top lieutenants on the way out, Democrats face a week of scrambling
to reshuffle their leadership and to reimpose a sense of mission on
a floundering chamber.
   When lawmakers return from their Memorial Day recess, they will
face one certain resignation _ that of Majority Whip Tony Coelho,
D-Calif. _ and another that is near certain, that of Texas Democrat
Wright.
   It is unprecedented for such a turnover, propelled by concerns
about ethics, to take place in the middle of a legislative session.
The turmoil only adds to Congress' woes over what has so far been a
lackluster year.
   It will be up to Rep. Tom Foley, D-Wash., the majority leader
and heir-apparent to Wright, to turn the disarray into order and to
refocus attention on the institution's primary tasks, dealing with
the budget deficit and with legislation ranging from the
environment to social issues.

   Forecasters preparing for Thursday's
opening of the Atlantic hurricane season wish they could predict
the arrival of new technological help they say may be crucial to
ever-growing coastal populations.
   The Air Force has agreed to fly hurricane reconnaissance flights
for two more years, but has made it clear it plans to phase out the
missions. And only one satellite is available for tracking
hurricanes.
   ``We just have nothing right now to lean on,'' says Ken
McKinnon, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Tom Lewis of North Palm Beach,
Fla., who has introduced a bill in Congress to keep hurricane
hunters flying at least another five years. ``We've got one
satellite and they're telling us it'll do the job. If it blinks,
how do you track weather?''

<HEAD>Rhine Cruise Taking Bush into Heart of Romantic Germany</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LORELEI ON THE RHINE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President Bush
sails by the towering Lorelei rock Wednesday, he will see one of
the most enduring symbols of romantic Germany but with an American
flag snapping atop the craggy peak.
   Legend has it that when Rhine River boatsmen sailed by the rock
in days of old, a shimmering, golden-haired maiden lured them into
shipwreck and death with her mesmerizing songs.
   ``This is certainly the prettiest part of the Rhine,'' says Rolf
Daum, mayor of the town that includes the Lorelei. ``We've had
several presidents and heads of state sail past over the years.''
   The sightseeing cruise aboard the triple-decked Stolzenfels was
planned as the final event of Bush's two-day trip to West Germany.
Bush was being accompanied by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and 300 invited guests.
   Daum says the riverfront town of St. Goarhausen will be
decorated in a sea of flags and local townsfolk will be waving.
``People here are very proud of this,'' he said.
   Ute Port, 24, a local pharmacist's assistant voted this year's
``Weinhexe,'' received the honor of seeing Bush off. ``Weinhexe''
literally means ``wine witch,'' and the young woman's duties
include promoting the local brands at festivals and similar events.
   The itinerary called for the presidential party to head north
from Oberwesel, where the 1,000-year Auf Schoenburg castle looms
above the river, to the ancient city of Koblenz.
   Security boats will be shielding the presidential cruise from
the barges from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland and
West Germany that ply the Rhine daily.
   The river has spawned many legends, including one that 19th
century German composer Richard Wagner turned into his cycle of
operas called The Ring of the Nibelungs.
   The legend of the Lorelei, the beautiful siren singing from the
rock high above the river bank, was immortalized by German poet
Heinrich Heine.
   Heine's poem ends:
   ``I believe the waves swallow up
   The boatsman and his boat in the end
   And that's what with her song
   The Lorelei has done.''
   Among the other sites along the route:
   _The Burg Katz, or Cat Castle. In a sign that change comes to
the most tradition-bound areas, the West German government is
negotiating to sell the castle to a Japanese businessman who wants
to turn it into a luxury hotel. Other Rhine castles have been
converted into hotels and restaurants.
   _Burg Maus, or Mouse Castle, another towering fortress that
according to legend sparked a local noble family to build the Burg
Katz out of jealousy.
   _Ruins of the Sterrenberg and Liebenstein castles, built next to
each other by two brothers locked in a legendary rivalry.
   _The storybook town of Boppard.
   ``I'm disappointed he couldn't stop here,'' Mayor Wolfgang Gipp
said. ``But the president can't be everywhere.''
   _The Marksburg castle, a conglomeration of spires and
chateau-style buildings high atop a steep, tree-covered hill. The
Marksburg is the only Rhine castle that was never destroyed.
   _The last major castle is the Stolzenfels, a sprawling complex
that also gave the name to the presidential cruise ship.
   The cruise ends in Koblenz, a city that dates to Roman times and
where the Mosel River flows into the Rhine.
   City spokeswoman Dorothee Stein-Hoppe said that after his
arrival, Bush will visit the enormous pedestal of a now-destroyed
monument to Kaiser Wilhelm I, who united Germany in 1871.
   ``American artillery destroyed the monument during World War
II,'' Ms. Stein-Hoppe said, adding that Bush's visit is the first
by an American president to the city.
   Local officials planned to give Bush a silver tray engraved with
thanks for the ``fond memory'' of his visit to the city.

<HEAD>Deposit Guaranty Builds Banking Success On Others' Failures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deposit Guaranty Bank didn't exist 15 months ago.
Now it is a $600 million-asset, privately owned financial
institution built mostly from the ruins of failed banks.
   Deposit Guaranty is the sole holding of TexOp Bancshares Inc.,
which still has a fund of $30 million it may use to buy additional
banks _ enough capital to become a $1.5 billion-asset bank without
additional financing.
   Given the troubles of the Texas financial community, with banks
and thrifts failing almost weekly _ some resulting in
multimillion-dollar federal bailouts _ Deposit Guaranty is swimming
against the tide.
   But Chairman Ron Steinhart and President Terry Kelley figure
they have a sound plan to stay afloat.
   ``The mission is to build a profitable, healthy Texas banking
organization and to take advantage of the problems, which are
opportunities for somebody,'' Kelley said in a recent interview.
   ``There was some management in place in various banks that had
no capital, and some capital was available if you could find
management,'' he said.
   ``We felt like it was a rare opportunity if we could provide the
capital and the management at a time when things were as they
were,'' Kelley said.
   Timing also was important, he said, because he and Steinhart
believed the state was returning to economic health.
   ``Five years ago we'd never have tried it,'' Steinhart said,
``and I don't think three years from now we'd try it because the
opportunity would have passed.''
   While the building blocks so far have generally been small,
often one-branch institutions, Deposit Guaranty executives still
toy with the idea of going after some large Texas banks that remain
on the auction block.
   Steinhart, a veteran of buying and selling Texas banks, admits
to continuing interest in Texas American Bancshares Inc., one of
the largest remaining problem banks.
   Since it was formed Feb. 8, 1988, Deposit Guaranty has purchased
13 banks, 11 of them in federally assisted transactions that leave
it with what Kelley calls ``sterilized assets.''
   The money came from a pool of private capital raised by Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. _ $8.8 million to buy the first bank and then $62
million more to finance other purchases.
   In its first 11 months of operation, Deposit Guaranty earned
$1.27 million for its investors, the largest of which is the
Harvard University endowment, with Goldman, Sachs and brothers
Robert and Richard Strauss as other principals, plus Steinhart and
Kelley.
   Deposit Guaranty has the advantage of obtaining its banks
without the encumbrances of past problems and the burdens of Texas'
old banking laws, which until last year virtually blocked statewide
banking.
   As a result of the old laws, many banks, even those owned by the
same holding company, were operated separately within each county,
leading to high management and real estate costs.
   ``We can look at what's the most efficient way to operate a bank
today and not be encumbered by an existing organization that may be
operated in a more traditional basis, which may not be
cost-effective and efficient in the future,'' Steinhart said.
   But more important is that all 11 of the failed banks have been
purchased in closed bank transactions, meaning Deposit Guaranty is
left with few of the obligations of the former bank. Even when
Deposit Guaranty acquires troubled assets, it is protected from
losses by federal regulators.
   ``We're buying essentially with problems fully reserved, so that
the large proportion of our people can direct their energies to
building a bank and building a customer base,'' Steinhart said.
   Steinhart and Kelley see a highly competitive future in Texas
banking, as problems are solved and the new owners _ many of which
are aggressive, out-of-state banks _ turn their attention to the
market.
   ``Initially they're sorting out the good loans, the bad loans;
who are the key people to keep and who are the key people to get
rid of, those kind of things,'' Kelley said. ``One of these days
that'll all be history, and they'll be focused on the market.''

<HEAD>CBS, NBC Plan to Shop For Viewers at Retail Stores</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Fixes style of ``K mart'' throughout.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC and CBS are going shopping for viewers next
fall at two of the nation's biggest retail outlets.
   Both networks are hooking up with retailers in ambitious
promotions that will tout the new television season that starts in
September through a combination of games, store displays, TV and
newspaper ads and direct mail.
   The alliances between NBC and Sears, Roebuck and Co. and between
CBS and K mart Corp. are the latest efforts by the networks to halt
the erosion of their audience to cable, independent TV outlets and
video tapes.
   Network executives hope that the promotions will encourage
people to tune in to the shows at least once, and possibly become
regular viewers.
   Advertising agency executives and network affiliates said it is
about time that the networks tried something new.
   The three major networks _ NBC, CBS and ABC _ claimed only 67
percent of the audience in prime time during the just-completed
1988-89 TV season, down from 70 percent in the 1987-88 season and
92 percent a decade ago.
   Joseph Ostrow, worldwide media director at ad agency Foote, Cone
&amp; Belding Communications in New York, said the networks have been
slow to recognize the the value of using a variety of marketing
techniques to boost viewership.
   In the past, the networks touted their shows simply by running
promotional spots on their own network or placing ads in newspaper
TV listings.
   ``They haven't gone to the full extent that a marketer would go
in selling a product,'' Ostrow said.
   Allen Banks, media director at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising
Inc., said mass marketers like Sears and K mart are logical matches
for TV networks.
   ``A large percentage of the population shops in either or both
of those stores,'' he said. ``It's a nice marriage between a mass
medium and a mass marketer.''
   Both the NBC and CBS promotions include contests designed to
make people aware of the new network shows. Participants can win
prizes ranging from cars, video equipment and vacations to an
appearance on an NBC program.
   Sears and K mart will give space in their weekly newspaper
supplements to their network partners, who will use it to list
contest questions.
   Those playing the CBS game will have to watch specific shows to
see if they have won, while those participating in NBC's contest
will be able to find the answers in the advertising supplement
itself.
   Contestants may claim their prizes or drop off their entries at
the stores, which will be decked out with signs promoting the
networks. The retailers will have all of their display TV sets
tuned to the appropriate network.
   The networks, for their part, will tout their retail partners in
a barrage of television advertising promoting the contest and and
fall schedule.
   George F. Schweitzer, who oversees advertising and promotions at
CBS, said all three networks suffered last year when a script
writer's strike delayed the start of the fall season.
   As a result, he said, some people never saw some of the new
shows simply because there never was a clear start to the new
season.
   ``This is a way to create some of the hoopla and excitement as
there was in years past,'' he said.
   Alan Cohen, vice president of network marketing at NBC, said the
promotion has been designed so that NBC affiliate stations will be
able to tie in to the national promotion with local events of their
own.
   Sears stores will have opening night celebrations that will
feature some of the local NBC station celebrities. Audio tapes that
will be run in the stores will have gaps that can be filled with
the local station's call letters so it sounds like a network star
has made a recording just for that location.
   Schweitzer said CBS plans to outline similar programs for its
affiliates at an upcoming meeting.
   Ben Tucker, an executive of Retlaw Broadcasting Co. of Fresno,
Calif., and head of the CBS affiliates advisory board, said he see
``tremendous potential'' in the CBS-K mart association.
   ``It sells the benefits of our product in different ways than
they have done in the past,'' he said.
   Will two or possibly three network promotions dilute the value
of all of them, cluttering the airwaves and possibly even turning
viewers off?
   Saatchi's Banks said he doesn't think so, and expects more
promotional tie-ins for the major networks and advertisers.
   ``Magazines have been in this business of tie-ins for years and
the cable networks have as well. Advertisers are looking for any
additional spin they can get out of an advertising schedule,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Survey: U.S. Manufacturers Look Forward To 1992 European Market</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of U.S. manufacturers that responded to
a recent survey plan to expand operations in Europe despite initial
fears they would face discrimination in the unified European market
slated for 1992.
   An overwhelming majority of chief executive officers surveyed
welcomed the freer market, with 84 percent predicting the
initiative would provide an opportunity to expand their sales and
operations in Europe.
   The Bank of Boston's economics department conducted the study
for the Scottish Development Agency, surveying about 10,000
manufacturing executives in four U.S. regions: New England, the
Mid-Atlantic states, the Great Lakes region and the Southeast.
   Of the 1,234 companies that responded to the survey, 57 percent
already have operations in Europe and 91 percent plan to implement
new corporate strategies before the end of 1990 in anticipation of
the unified European market.
   The 12 nations of the European Economic Community, also known as
the Common Market, plan to dismantle trade barriers and form a
single, European-wide market by 1992.
   Of the U.S. companies polled with no presence in Europe, 58
percent planned to enter the market through new subsidiaries, sales
representative offices or joint ventures with European companies.
   Robert Crawford, the North American director of the Glasgow,
Scotland-based trade association, told manufacturers at a seminar
last week that they ``must start acting rather than thinking about
1992 or you will fall further behind.''
   ``Your strategies related to 1992 must include serious
consideration of locating in Europe and establishing a base if you
are to gain market share and remain globally competitive,'' he said.
   The report said that more than half of U.S. companies with
operations in Europe have their main base in Great Britain, and
many companies planning to open operations in Europe favored
beginning in England.
   The report said a ``small number'' of U.S. companies antcipated
problems with the new European market, such as intensified
competition from newly merged European companies and possible new
restrictive laws.
   But most of those polled said they would welcome 1992. Among the
things looked forward to included fewer import barriers, the
development of uniform product standards and common regulations,
and less bureaucratic interference in commercial affairs.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose Monday in European trading that
was greatly reduced by the Memorial Day holiday in the United
States and a bank holiday in Britain. Gold prices fell.
   In Frankfurt, traders said they had not seen any signs of
central bank intervention in the open market during the European
day and, citing the absence of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, said
they didn't expect any.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose a sharp 2.48 yen to close at 142.88 yen
from Friday's 140.40. Later, in Europe, it was quoted at 142.53 yen.
   Currency dealers in Japan said the dollar's strength followed
its rally in the Sydney market, which opened earlier than Tokyo.
   ``The dollar's bullishness is largely due to speculative
actions,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese commercial bank,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Dealers said the Bank of Japan sold about $800 million Monday in
an attempt to brake the rising dollar. Officials at the central
bank declined to comment.
   Tokyo dealers also said a report that West German monetary
authorities are unlikely to hike key interest rates contributed to
the dollar's bullishness.
   In Europe, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
1.5710 dollars to buy one pound, cheaper than 1.5922 dollars late
Friday in London.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
   _2.0101 West German marks, up from 1.9675

<HEAD>Nissan, GE Capital To Launch Auto Maintenance Venture in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest carmaker,
said Monday it will join GE Capital, a major U.S. finance company,
in launching a corporate automobile fleet maintenance company in
Japan.
   It will be the first such business to be undertaken by a company
in Japan, said a Nissan official who spoke anonymously.
   Nissan said the service will be started through a business
tie-up with Stamford, Conn.-based GE Capital, a division of the
General Electric Co. The Nissan official said other details had yet
to be finalized.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a major Japanese economic newspaper,
said the joint venture, scheduled to start business in July, will
be owned about 50 percent by Nissan, 30 percent by GE Capital and
20 percent by six Japanese commercial banks.
   In the fleet service business, an agent handles a variety of
jobs necessary to maintain cars owned by companies, including
regular inspections, repair and refueling.
   GE Capital has about 20 years of fleet service experience,
handling about 440,000 vehicles in the United States, the Nihon
Keizai Shimbun said.
