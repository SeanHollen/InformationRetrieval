   Atlanta's famous Peachtree Street will be
turning peachy soon.
   Members of the Georgia Peach Commission, a grower-financed group
that promotes the state's peach crop, will donate 20 trees next
month during a ceremony in downtown Atlanta.
   ``During the national Democratic Convention in July, visitors
wondered why there were no peach trees,'' said spokeswoman Judy
Harmon. ``I thought the Peach Commission should do something to
remedy that.''
   Ms. Harmon said she contacted Atlanta officials and learned that
the peach trees that once lined the street were not replaced when
they died because they created a nuisance.
   ``The fruit attracts bugs and the trees aren't very tolerant of
auto pollution,'' she said during a recent interview at a meeting of
peach growers in Fort Valley.
   She said city officials were skeptical about planting peach trees
along the street until she discovered a variety that produces
beautiful blooms, but no fruit.
   ``That's what we're going to plant,'' she said.
   Atlanta began in the 1840s as the terminus of the Western and
Atlantic Railroad, and Peachtree Street, running northward along a
line of ridges, quickly became an important commercial and
residential thoroughfare in the growing city.
   Beginning near Woodruff Park downtown, the street runs through
office, hotel and business complexes. Further north, Peachtree is
lined with stately homes built early in the century. The road ends
more than 40 miles from downtown Atlanta in rural northeast Georgia.
   The Peach Commission's trees will be planted in Woodruff Park
during a ceremony tentatively set for March 23, said Ms. Harmon, who
hopes the tree planting will encourage others to plant peach trees
along the street.
   ``It restores some meaning to the name of Peachtree,'' she said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: The Valentine's Day Love-in in El Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The five Central American presidents showed
more interest in making love than war last Tuesday, an appropriate
activity for Valentine's Day, but the question now is whether
anybody is going to cheat.
   President Bush says he's wary of the promises Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega made to hold a free and fair election
because he believes the Sandinista leader has been unfaithful in the
past after making similar pledges.
   But the four other leaders _ all friendly to the United States _
who assembled with Ortega at a beachside resort in El Salvador
believed Ortega's promises were heartfelt enough to give him the
benefit of the doubt.
   The result was unanimous agreement on a lengthy communique
designed to lay the groundwork for two objectives all sides say they
want: peace and democracy in Nicaragua.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., felt Ortega's stated commitment in
the communique to democracy was so convincing that the Nicaraguan
Contras should declare victory.
   ``I think this is what the Contra forces in essence have been
asking,'' said Bonior, long a Contra antagonist. ``I think it
presents a unique opportunity for them to take advantage.''
   But Bush was more skeptical. ``What's troubling me is that ...
claims like this have been made at one time, only to see those
claims repudiated,'' Bush said Thursday.
   In return for his promises of democratic reform, Ortega got his
colleagues from Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala to
agree to draw up a plan within 90 days that will lead to the
demobilization of the Contras.
   That has been Ortega's highest priority for years. A year ago,
the U.S. Congress granted his wish to suspend military aid to the
rebels; now, his neighbors are agreeing to their demobilization.
   Meanwhile, the United States has been playing the unaccustomed
role of bystander to events in Central America. The Bush
administration has yet to make some key appointments, including some
at the State Department, and has been occupied with other issues,
leaving a vacuum in Central America which the five countries decided
to fill this week.
   The administration's hand in Central America seems to get weaker
by the day. Two years ago, some in the administration had high hopes
that the Contras would be able to topple the Sandinistas.
   A year ago, the goal was reduced to just getting Congress to
approve humanitarian aid for the rebels. Now, the administration
wants to find a way to head off the planned Contra demobilization,
hoping that their continued existence _ if only as a potential
military menace _ will induce Ortega to keep his word.
   At a minimum, this has been an interesting week for the Reagan
doctrine, the grand design of the former president to assist the
Contras and anti-communist rebels elsewhere who are fighting
pro-Soviet regimes.
   The Contras were once the centerpiece of that doctrine but they
are now reduced to what amounts to welfare recipients: huddled in
austere camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border, living off
U.S.-donated food, facing the specter of demobilization, and praying
that the political winds in Washington will some day favor them
again.
   In contrast to the Contras, the news was somewhat better this
week for another pet rebel group of Reagan's _ the Afghan
resistance. The day after the Central American presidents called for
the demobilization of the Contras, the last Soviet soldier withdrew
from Afghanistan in a major triumph both for U.S. policy and for the
anti-Soviet resistance.
   But the Soviet-backed regime is still in power and peace still
seems distant in Afghanistan as the two sides, both heavily-armed by
their respective superpower patrons, continue their struggle with
the Soviet Army on the sidelines for the first time in nine years.
   The United States pressed the Soviets to withdraw for years but,
now that the Kremlin has complied, Washington is escalating its
objectives.
   Bush said it would not be fair for the United States to cut off
aid to the rebels after the departing Soviet soldiers left behind
all those fighter aircraft, helicopters, tanks, howitzers and other
equipment.
   So in Afghanistan, the somewhat incongruous Valentine's Week
prospect is for a lot more warmaking than lovemaking.

   President Bush says he will continue helping
rebel groups in Afghanistan after the Soviet Army's withdrawal, and
fully intends to support the Contras in Nicaragua when their current
aid expires next month.
   Bush said Thursday he preferred a peaceful reconciliation in
Afghanistan but was concerned that departing Soviet forces may have
stockpiled weapons for the Marxist government in Kabul.
   ``It would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethal
supplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance and
thus leave an uacceptable imbalance,'' he said in a session with
reporters in the Oval Office.
   Bush's remarks came a day after Soviet troops completed their
withdrawal. Their departure has caused widespread fears that a
struggle for control by competing guerrilla groups could throw
Afghanistan into a civil war.
   ``The time for recrimination is over,'' Bush said. ``The time for
bloodbaths is over and I would like to see the various factions get
together and come up with recommendations that would lead to a
peaceful Afghanistan with no more bloodbaths.''
   Turning to Nicaragua and the rebels fighting the leftist
Sandinista government, Bush said: ``I have every intention of seeing
that these people receive humanitarian support. But how that comes
about, we'll just have to wait and see.''
   Bush made the statement even though administration officials
acknowledge that Congress has gained the upper hand on the question
of giving assistance to the rebels. The current aid program expires
March 31.
   New questions have been raised about U.S. policy in Central
America as a result of the agreement by the presidents of five
Central American nations, including Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega, to a
peace plan that would produce free elections by February 1990 in
exchange for dismantling the Contra fighting force.
   On other matters, Bush said:
   _He would ``strongly oppose'' any attempt to outlaw all
semiautomatic weapons if that would mean outlawing all pistols and
rifles that could be fired continuously by repeatedly pulling the
trigger. The weapons are popular among drug gangs and one was used
to kill five children in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard last month.
   _The tedious pace of making personnel appointments has him
fustrated. But Bush also said that ``I don't think it's hurting the
government.''
   _He hopes his campaign for high ethical standards in government
has not ``created something that just carries things too far.''
   He expressed sympathy for Louis Sullivan, his nominee as
secretary of health and human services, who gave up accumulated
sabbatical pay to join the government. Bush also said that Secretary
of State James A. Baker III had ``made the right decision'' to sell
stocks in a New York bank holding company that holds Third World
loans.
   While applauding the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan as ``a
new chapter in the history'' of that country, Bush said he does not
accept the Soviet call for a cease-fire and arms embargo.
   During a Soviet Embassy news conference, Minister-Counselor
Yevgeny Kutovoy, the second-ranking official, said ``the question at
stake at the present time is this: either restoration of peace on
the Afghan soil or continuation of senseless bloodshed.''
   But State Department spokesman Charles Redman said there has been
massive stockpiling by the Soviets in recent months.
   Supplies provided to the Kabul regime reportedly include numerous
fighter aircraft and helicopters, dozens of medium tanks, infantry
fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, more than 200
howitzers and scores of other artillery pieces and hundreds of
transport vehicles.

<TEXT>
   The battle for control of Lebanon's
Christian heartland will have a profound impact on efforts to hold
this fractured country together.
   The power struggle appears to be finely balanced between army
commander Michel Aoun and Samir Geagea, head of the Lebanese Forces,
the main Christian militia. But political figures say Aoun must
crush Geagea's heavily armed fighters quickly if he is to have any
chance of victory.
   Should Aoun come out on top, he likely will emerge as Lebanon's
next president, filling a vacuum caused when Amin Gemayel's term
expired Sept. 22. No successor has been elected because Christians
opposed the Syrian-backed candidates.
   If Geagea wins, a senior Moslem official said, ``It'll be the
final divorce, the irrevocable partition of Lebanon ... and possibly
a new round of civil war fighting.''
   Electing Aoun would make accommodation of Syria and its Lebanese
Moslem and leftist allies possible and avert the threatened
formalization of Lebanon's partition into sectarian cantons.
   Removing Geagea, fiercely anti-Syrian and anti-Moslem, has long
been a key demand of Syria and its Lebanese allies, who allege the
militia commander has close ties with Israel.
   Geagea says the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate are an occupation force, and he demands
their unconditional withdrawal as a precondition for a
Christian-Moslem settlement.
   Aoun appears to be aiming to drive Geagea out of east Beirut,
isolating him north of the city, so that the capital can be reunited
and Parliament convened to elect him president on a platform of
reunifying the country.
   Minutes before Gemayel stepped down, he named Aoun prime minister
of a caretaker military government until a successor could be
elected.
   Aoun sought to strengthen his presidential chances by forging a
hasty and uneasy alliance with Geagea.
   That outraged Syria and its allies. They rejected Aoun and
supported the predominantly Moslem Cabinet of acting Prime Minister
Salim Hoss that had governed under Gemayel.
   The split fractured the 42,000-man army, long plagued by
sectarian divisions, and deepened prospects of formal partition.
   Western diplomats in east Beirut doubt Aoun's troops will be able
to swiftly dislodge the Lebanese Forces from their strongholds along
25 miles of the Mediterranean coast north of Beirut.
   ``The army has superior armor and firepower. But there's the
issue of loyalty,'' said one diplomat, who requested anonymity.
``Its questionable how long Aoun's troops and officers will be
willing to press the campaign against their coreligionists in the
Lebanese Forces.''
   Most of the fighters on both sides are Maronites, and pressure
for a cease-fire is escalating from the sect's spiritual and
political leaders.
   Aoun counts mainly on three brigades trained by U.S. Green
Berets, as well as three battalions of commandos and military
police. These units total about 12,000 men, with 98 U.S.-supplied
M-48 battle tanks and 50 French-built AMX-13 light tanks.
   Geagea's militia has 6,000 hard-core fighters with thousands more
reservists. Geagea has 12 M-48s plus 60 T-54 tanks.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon, but its peace efforts
have bogged down in the country's unending violence and the complex
puzzle of its politics.
   Syria's alliance with Iran has also been strained by a challenge
from the Tehran-backed Hezbollah for supremacy of Lebanon's 1
million Shiite Moslems, the country's largest sect.
   Hezbollah, the mirror image of the Lebanese Forces on the Moslem
side, seeks to create an Islamic Republic in Lebanon.
   Its power has been weakened by Syria's main surrogate, the Shiite
Amal militia, in fighting aimed at eliminating Hezbollah's Moslem
extremists. That would make a Christian-Moslem settlement easier.

   Gov. William Donald Schaefer announced a
tentative settlement of the 22-week Baltimore Symphony Orchestra
strike late Thursday night, but released no details of the agreement.
   The settlement ends the walk-out that began last September, and
concludes the longest running symphony strike in American orchestral
history.
   ``For all intents and purposes, the strike is over,'' Schaefer
said at an 11 p.m. news conference.
   The 96 members of the orchestra must still ratify the agreement,
which Schaefer said could occur by this weekend. The next BSO
concerts are scheduled for next Thursday and Friday nights.
   If the strike had not been settled by Monday, the orchestra would
have been forced to cancel its East Coast tour scheduled for next
month.
   Last November, the players proposed a four-year contract that
would have brought their salaries to $1,050 a week in the last six
months of the 1991-1992 season.
   Management countered by offering a contract that would have paid
the players a minimum of $1,030 a week in the last three months of
that season, including guarantees for broadcast and recording work.
   Under the contract that expired in September, the players had
earned a minimum of $770 a week.
   Thursday's negotiating session at the State Office Building was
the first between the two sides since mediated contract talks broke
off nearly a month ago.

<TEXT>
   A court in western China has given a suspended
death sentence to the leader of a gang of tomb robbers, the official
Xinhua News Agency said today.
   The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region court upheld a lower court
death sentence for Yang Xionglin for encouraging peasants in the
Turfan area to rob 86 tombs from the Spring and Autumn Warring
States Period (770-221 B.C.)
   But the high court said the sentence would be converted to life
imprisonment as long as the prisoner demonstrated repentance over
the next two years.
   Xinhua said the peasants sold 90 stolen cultural relics to Yang
for $116. The relics individually command prices of thousands of
dollars when smuggled to antique markets in Hong Kong and other
foreign countries.
   The Chinese government in recent years has tried to crack down on
lucrative smuggling operations in antiques and other cultural
treasures.

<HEAD>$13.2 Billion to Give Medicaid Coverage to All Below Poverty Line</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government and the states would
have to spend at least $13.2 billion more to expand the Medicaid
program to cover all Americans who live in poverty, according to a
coalition led by the American Medical Association.
   The coalition proposed such a plan Thursday to cover the
estimated 11 million people whose incomes are below the federal
poverty level but who do not now qualify for the health assistance
program.
   ``Medicaid simply does not work adequately in its current form,''
said James R. Tallon Jr., majority leader of the New York State
Assembly and chairman of the coalition's committee on Medicaid. ``We
call for a system that truly cares for the needs of the poor.''
   Though Medicaid was established as a federal-state program to
serve the medical needs of the poor, fewer than half of the 33
million Americans below the poverty line are covered by the program,
the coalition said.
   Eligibility varies from state to state, and as health-care costs
have soared, states have trimmed growth in their Medicaid costs by
restricting eligibility.
   As a result, the average income threshold for eligibility in 1988
was $4,792 gross annual income for a family of three _ 49 percent of
the federal poverty level of $9,690, the report said. In Alabama,
the state with the lowest income threshold, a family of three can
earn no more than $1,416 a year to qualify for Medicaid.
   The coalition, called the Health Policy Agenda for the American
People, said its plan to expand the Medicaid program and improve
benefits would cost $13.2 billion to $28 billion above current
Medicaid expenditures, with most of the additional cost borne by the
federal government.
   ``We are placing before the people a tough statement that there
is an unmet need; it is well documented; the program is falling
substantially short _ it covers fewer than half the poor in the
country _ and that's going to have to fall to government,'' Tallon
said. ``New resources have to be made available because we have a
system that's crumbling.''
   In fiscal 1988, the federal government spent about $30.5 billion
and the states spent about $20.5 billion on Medicaid.
   The coalition proposes to:
   _Establish a standard benefits package states would be required
to provide. That would add $6.5 billion for a ``median'' package and
up to $21.5 billion for a package that included more services.
   _Set income eligibility for the program at no less than the
federal poverty level, and require eligibility for those with
incomes above the poverty level who have extraordinary medical costs.
   _Raise reimbursement rates for physicians and hospitals at least
to the level of Medicare rates, which would cost an additional $4.4
billion.
   Reimbursement rates have dropped so low that at least a quarter
of the nation's physicians don't treat Medicaid patients. Raising
rates would ``encourage greater participation by health-care
providers and more frequent, appropriate visits by patients to
physicians' offices for preventive care,'' the group said.
   The report by the coalition, which represents both business and
labor interests, stayed away from any recommendations on requiring
employers to provide health insurance to their employees. Without
such a requirement, some employers who now provide insurance
coverage for employees who would be covered by the expanded Medicaid
program might drop the private coverage, potentially adding more
than $5 billion to the cost of the expanded program.
   However, the coalition noted that requiring employer-based health
insurance for all employees and their dependents would provide
coverage to 5.6 million uninsured workers below the poverty line.
That would reduce the cost of the expanded program by an estimated
$4.6 billion, the group said.
   Currently, some 35 million Americans have no health insurance.
   The Health Policy Agenda for the American People was organized in
1982 by the American Medical Association. The AMA pays for most of
the work of the coalition, which is composed of 172 groups
representing business, labor, consumers, the elderly, children and
health-care providers.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says he's
looking for men and women who aren't afraid of hard work and have
good sense.
   Yeutter told rank-and-file Agriculture Department employees
Thursday that he has interviewed ``a lot of outstanding people in
the last 30 days'' for jobs in the federal agencies he oversees.
   ``I feel good about the quality level, talent level that we're
going to be able to assemble here,'' he said. ``If we can just get
cleared through the White House's office of personnel, we may
eventually get them on board.''
   Appointments to scores of high-level posts within the Bush
administration are being held up for clearances and other paperwork
associated with the changeover from the Reagan years. The No. 2 job
in USDA, for example, is still being performed by Deputy Secretary
Peter C. Myers.
   ``One of the questions I have asked every one of these people is
how hard they're prepared to work, because if they come, they're
going to work awfully hard, probably a lot harder then they've ever
worked before,'' Yeutter said.
   He added: ``I also want them to work smart. Working hard is one
thing, working smart is another, and we're going to try to find
people who will work smart, too.''
   Only a few minutes before his brief remarks to USDA employees,
Yeutter got his marching orders from President Bush during a formal
swearing-in ceremony.
   Bush said he expected Yeutter to help ``make sure our objectives
in agriculture are achieved'' as the new administration pursues the
longtime U.S. goal of reducing world trade barriers.
   Bush said Yeutter's name ``rhymes with fighter'' and that he is
``tough as nails, knowledgeable _ that's why I picked him. And I
know he's going to fight hard for farming, for fair trade and for
all the other important responsibilities for this department.''
   Yeutter, 58, who holds degrees in law and economics, is a farm
native of Nebraska and has held many public and private posts,
including Agriculture Department service in the early 1970s and
president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange from 1978 to 1985.
   Bush said Yeutter had an ``outstanding tenure'' for 3{ years as
President Reagan's trade representative. He said Yeutter will work
closely with Carla Hills, the new trade representative, to help
protect the interests of American farmers during multinational trade
talks.
   Yeutter was confirmed unanimously by the Senate on Feb. 8 and was
officially sworn in as secretary without ceremony later the same day
at the Agriculture Department.
   In Thursday's ceremonial event, which included a color guard,
Marine band and family members, Yeutter's repeated oath of office
was administered by Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who
also had sworn him in as trade representative in 1985.
   Bush said Yeutter ``is about to make an enduring commitment to
this department, and then told a story about a farmer making a
breakfast of eggs and bacon to show the difference between
involvement and commitment.
   ``The chicken is involved, but the pig is committed,'' Bush said.

   New estimates by the Agriculture Department
show the number of cattle being fed for the slaughter market as of
Feb. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.7 million head, down
2 percent from a year ago but 5 percent more than inventories of two
years ago.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.71 million head, up 3 percent from a year
ago but 8 percent more than two years ago. Officials said Thursday
it was the largest January feedlot placement since 1974.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in January totaled 1.67 million
head, down 5 percent from a year ago and down 7 percent from two
years ago.
   As of Feb. 1, feedlot inventories were smaller than a year
earlier in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska and Texas. But California,
Iowa and Kansas showed an increases. The seven states produce about
three-fourths of the nation's beef.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of Feb. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

   The Agriculture Department says the nation's
potato stockpile was about 144.6 million hundredweight as of Feb. 1,
down 13 percent from a year ago.
   According to USDA records, that was the smallest Feb. 1 inventory
since 1983 and compared with 166.7 million hundredweight a year ago.
   The estimates were for potatoes harvested last fall in the major
producing states. Fall potato production in those states, many of
them hit by drought, declined to a five-year low of 299.3 million
hundredweight from 333.1 million in 1987, the report said Thursday.

Andes, the government said.
   The state news agency Andina said Thursday that the crash
occurred near the northcentral town of Otuzco, 340 miles from Lima.
   No other vehicles were involved in the crash, which police blamed
on recent torrential rains that washed out sections of the crude

<HEAD>Critics Say Treasury Caved in to Pressure from Abroad</HEAD>

   The Bush administration flunked its first world
trade test by caving in to pressure from abroad and cutting back on
duty levels for imported sport utility vehicles and vans, critics
say.
   At issue was a decision Thursday in which the Treasury Department
scaled back a Customs Service ruling and said only some foreign-made
sport utility vehicles and vans will be reclassified as trucks.
   The Customs Service in January had said it would classify all the
vehicles as trucks, upon which a 25 percent duty is imposed, rather
than as cars, subject to a 2.5 percent duty.
   After Thursday's reversal, U.S. carmakers and members of Congress
from auto-making states said the Bush administration let itself be
swayed by foreign lobbyists.
   ``The Bush administration clearly caved in to pressure from the
Japanese,'' said Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich. ``This decision hurts
America _ it costs us money and jobs.''
   Michigan's other senator, Democrat Carl Levin, saw it the same
way: ``In its first major action on trade, the Bush administration
has put the wrong foot forward.''
   The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, which represents
domestic carmakers, said the original ruling to boost duties had
been the correct one.
   ``The Customs Service ought to decide U.S. trade practices, not
foreign manufacturers,'' the association said.
   Foreign automakers were more conciliatory, but said none of the
affected vehicles should be subject to 25 percent duties, which they
characterized as a new tax by the ``no-new-taxes'' president.
   They also raised the specter of higher sticker prices on both
imported and domestic sport utility vehicles and vans.
   Toyota Motor Sales USA congratulated Treasury ``for courage in
the face of massive political pressure from Detroit'' but said none
of the vehicles should be classified as trucks.
   Curt Bartsch, a spokesman for Nissan Motor Corp. in USA, said the
Treasury ruling ``reduces but does not eliminate the economic harm
brought by the tax.''
   Laura Segall, speaking for American Suzuki Motor Corp., said the
ruling ``probably will mean overall more expensive sport-utility
vehicles being imported, which will be followed by more expensive
domestic sport-utility vehicles.''
   The Treasury Department, meanwhile, characterized its decision as
a technical matter based on ``legal classification issues'' rather
than a reflection of U.S. trade policy.
   Under past policy, the vehicles sometimes were considered cars
and sometimes were classified as trucks, depending on whether they
were fitted with back seats and other amenities. Forty-four percent
of the 239,000 affected vehicles imported last year were classified
as trucks.
   Under the plan announced Thursday, four-door sport-utility
vehicles will be classified as cars and two-door models will be
considered trucks. Vans will be considered cars if they feature rear
seats, rear windows and rear doors.
   Treasury officials said that had the same policy been in effect
last year, 66 percent of affected vehicles would have been
classified as trucks, bringing in another $83 million in duties.

<HEAD>Conservatives, Liberals Each Claim Congress Leans Their Way</HEAD>

   The Massachusetts congressional delegation
showed its liberal colors and Wyoming was the most conservative
state in 1988, according to a survey by the American Conservative
Union.
   A lawmaker with a rating of 100 percent is one who voted in
accordance with the position of the conservative group in all
instances. In Massachusetts the average score was just 3.69. In
Wyoming, it was 97.3.
   Based on its selection of 22 key votes in the two chambers, some
of which the group gave double weight, the ACU said both the House
and Senate voted more conservatively in 1988 than in 1987. The
average House rating went from 37 percent to 44 percent, while the
Senate average went from 40 percent to 43 percent.
   In both chambers, however, the move to the right was made easier
by a lack of confrontation over tough budget issues last year, due
to the 1987 budget summit, the group said.
   Last month, the Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal group,
released a similar survey and declared that the Congress had become
more liberal.
   The differences occur because the two groups base their surveys
on different vote lists. However, the surveys do highlight the
ideological differences between the parties.
   The ACU said four senators and 38 House members, all Republicans,
scored 100 percent. The ADA last month gave two senators and two
dozen House members, all Democrats, 100 percent ratings.
   The conservative group in its rating gave double weight to votes
on three issues: aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the override
of President Reagan's veto of the Grove City civil rights extension
bill, and a vote on shifting $100 million away from the Star Wars
missile defense system.

   The Justice Department plans to detain Central
American refugees in a ``tent city'' on isolated South Texas
brushland while their applications for political asylum are
processed, congressional officials say.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Duke Austin said
Thursday that there had been ``no public disclosure'' of the Bush
administration's plans for handling the flood of refugees and that
the issue was still under review.
   But Capitol Hill officials disclosed the Justice Department plan
to pitch tents on land adjacent to a minimum-security federal
detention center now being used to process the refugees'
applications.
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said in a statement that the tent camp
would meet basic human necessities of adequate housing, food and
sanitary conditions.
   More than 2,000 refugees from Central America are crossing into
the United States illegally every week, most of them coming across
the Rio Grande at Brownsville from Mexico, officials say.
   Treatment of the refugees by INS has sparked a lawsuit. U.S.
District Judge Filemon Vela on Jan. 9 blocked an INS policy that had
barred asylum-seekers from traveling beyond the Rio Grande Valley
while their applications were pending. Under the INS policy, many of
the refugees had been relegated to squalid squatters' camps lacking
basic sanitation and other amenities.
   A congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Justice Department hopes word of the tent-city detention center
quickly reaches Central America and discourages more amnesty-seekers
from coming to the United States.
   INS officials contend that many are seeking only to better
themselves economically and are not actually fleeing political
repression. Advocates for the refugees say many INS decisions have
been politically skewed because the U.S. government is unwilling to
admit the extent of repression by Central American governments
allied with the United States.
   The Justice Department plans to keep the refugees in tents near
the Port Isabel Service Processing Center, about 15 miles north of
Brownsville, the congressional officials said.

<HEAD>Arab World Takes Economic Road To Unity, Using Common Market Model</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two new Arab economic pacts being forged
this week show a shift from the grandiose unity plans that once
sowed hope, suspicion and conflict throughout the Arab world.
   The Arab Cooperation Council born Thursday in Baghdad and the
Union of Maghreb Arab Countries under discussion in Morocco reflect
modern economic concerns, including reduced trade barriers and the
opening of internal markets.
   Their model is closer to the European Common Market than the
ill-fated United Arab Republic that joined Syria and Egypt as a
single nation from 1958 to 1961.
   Dozens of Arab unity proposals have been born and died since the
region gained its independence from European powers after World War
II, frustrated by the borders dividing people with a common language
and common culture.
   Many tried in a stroke to sweep away the frontiers, physically
unite armed forces or unify foreign policy. Virtually all efforts
failed, victims of internal rivalry, external interference or
shifting political tides.
   But like the EEC, the new groupings have a political impact.
   They have divided the Arab world into three main economic blocs:
the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council in the Arabian Peninsula,
the five-country Maghreb Union stretching from Libya to the Atlantic
and the Arab Cooperation Council of Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and North
Yemen.
   If successful, the new groupings will give their members access
to wider markets that should make their farms and industries more
efficient and enhance their bargaining power in the world economy.
   It might also be easier for the three blocs to reach effective
agreements on economic cooperation than it has been for the 21
individual Arab countries.
   The Gulf Cooperation Council, formed in 1981, evolved into a
military and olitical alliance under the threat of the Iran-Iraq war.
   While the leaders of the new Arab Council deny plans to form a
military bloc or a political alliance, Egypt, Iraq and Jordan
already cooperate militarily in some ways.
   They also include two of the Arab world's strongest military
forces _ Iraq and Egypt _ as well as one of the best trained, Jordan.
   Several of the leaders have acknowledged their economic
cooperation has political implications. Their charter said they
acted in part to enhance ``pan-Arab security against current or
future threats.''
   But while they have left the door open to other states, the union
will arouse apprehension in other quarters.
   Syrian leaders cannot enjoy watching Jordanian TV reach into
Syrian homes with celebratory broadcasts of singers lauding Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein as ``Saddam the Joy.''
   They remain deeply at odds with both Egypt and Iraq, which have
tightened their embrace of a Syrian friend, Jordan.
   The union adds to Syria's isolation, already aggravated by Arab
support for Iraq in the Persian Gulf war, where fighting was halted
Aug. 20 under a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire, and Egypt's reintegration
into the Arab fold after years of estrangement following its 1979
peace treaty with Israel.
   The new council also helps cement Egypt's return to the Arab
world.
   But the political clout of the Arab Council will be limited by
economic difficulties faced by all four countries, as well as by
outside interests all still maintain.
   Jordan, Iraq and Egypt particularly look to Saudi Arabia for
economic aid and can ill afford to alienate it.
   The new agreement ties Iraq to Arab countries lying to the west,
but Baghdad is counting on money from its southern gulf neighbors to
help finance post-war reconstruction.

   Jones was in Orlando for an October concert when WHTQ-AM
telephoned her at her hotel between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., the lawsuit
said.
   The station and its owner, TK Communications of Fort Lauderdale,
have a celebrity wake-up feature in which well-known people are
roused ``from a deep sleep, without their knowledge, to see what
embarrassing or confusing things might be said,'' according to the
lawsuit.
   Jones' lawsuit, filed Wednesday, also claims that WHTQ should
have arranged for a commercial fee to be paid to her since the
station informed its listeners in advance that it would be phoning
the former star of television's ``The Partridge Family.''
   WHTQ and TK Communications were unavailable for comment Thursday

   ``There are a lot of issues that Miss America is asked to address

   ``I would like to say that I am, but I am not,'' she said. ``So

   Miss Carlson, 22, of Anoka, Minn., said problems related to
drugs, violence or teen-age sex are ``a manifestation of the

   She attributed that breakdown to homes where both parents work,

<HEAD>Cities with Polluted Air up 41 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air pollution last summer was the worst of the
decade and the number of cities where ozone exceeded federally
approved levels jumped 41 percent, according to preliminary federal
figures.
   ``This new information shows the clear fallacy in industry
arguments that America's air pollution problems are solving
themselves,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who made the figures
public on Thursday.
   A year ago the Environmental Protection Agency listed 68 cities
that had recorded peak ozone levels considered unsafe under federal
standards. Last summer the number jumped to 96 metropolitan areas
plus two areas considered to be rural.
   The House subcommittee on health and environment, chaired by
Waxman, had requested the data from the federal agency.
   EPA officials said the data were only preliminary and had not
been thoroughly analyzed. But they acknowledged the findings
indicate a significant increase in urban pollution in 1988 and
suggested that when the final numbers are evaluated from all
monitoring points the number of cities where pollution exceeds
federal standards could exceed 100.
   The preliminary data submitted to Waxman's subcommittee show peak
daily ozone pollution levels last summer were on average 5 percent
higher than in 1983, which had been widely regarded as having the
worst ozone pollution this decade. Last summer's levels of ozone, a
key component of smog, were on average 14 percent greater than those
in 1987.
   Waxman called the data startling enough to affect the
congressional debate on how to strengthen federal air pollution laws.
   ``I expect this data to give a strong boost to congressional
efforts to establish long overdue new pollution control requirements
for the automobiles, factories, power plants and other pollution
sources which contribute to the urban smog that now afflicts almost
every American city,'' said Waxman.
   Waxman's subcommittee has scheduled a hearing later this month on
the health impact of the air pollution. He said the latest EPA data
indicate that more than 100 million Americans now live in cities
with levels of ozone or carbon monoxide pollution than exceed what
the federal government considers safe.
   Ozone pollution, caused by a variety of emissions from cars and
trucks as well as industrial plants and factories, causes coughing
and chest pains and has been linked by some scientists to permanent
lung damage.
   According to the EPA findings, two-thirds of the agency's 323
monitoring sites reported higher ozone pollution levels last summer
than in any other summer this decade.
   The information, which was collected by the EPA from state and
local air pollution control agencies, covered the period from April
through October, 1988. The EPA suggested that the hot summer
contributed to the ozone problem.
   The additional areas that were classified in 1988 as exceeding
federal ozone pollution levels were:
   Manchester, N.H.; Buffalo, Glen Falls and adjacent Essex County,
and Poughkeepsie, all in New York state; Sussex County, Del.;
Altoona, Erie, Johnstown, Lancaster, Harrisburg, Reading, Scranton
and Sharon, all in Pennsylvania; Charleston and Greenbrier County in
West Virginia;
   Fayetteville and Greensboro, in North Carolina; Greenville and
adjacent Cherokee County in South Carolina; Knoxville, Tenn.;
Lafayette, Ind.; Canton, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo and Youngstown,
all in Ohio; Lake Charles, La.; Kansas City, Mo.; and Denver.
   An area is considered to have exceeded the federal levels if it
has a daily peak ozone level of more than 0.12 parts per million of
pollutant.

   An 80-year-old porcelain doll that lay forgotten in
a nurse's attic was sold for a record $159,000, Sotheby's auction
house said.
   The 21-inch German-made bisque doll _ a red-haired, blue-eyed
girl in a pale blue dress _ is one of only 10 of its type made by
Kammer and Reinhardt, the auction house said Thursday.
   The buyer was described only as a Madame Vierny, a Frenchwoman
planning to open a museum of childhood in Paris. The same woman
bought the previous record-making doll, a 17th century wooden doll
that fetched $107,000 in March 1987.
   The unidentified owner is a nurse from Sussex, England, who
Sotheby's said had played regularly, and rather roughly, with the
doll through her childhood, even pushing it around in a doll
carriage with her dog.
   Just before Christmas, the nurse cleared it out of her attic with
other dolls she had collected and took it to be valued, Sotheby's
said.
   The auction house had estimated its pre-sale price at $26,550 to
$35,400.
   Another toy, a clockwork battleship, also sold Thursday for
$70,092, a record for a tinplate toy.
   The hand-painted model was made in 1904 by a German firm,
Marklin. The previous record was $49,649 paid at Sotheby's in 1984
for a tinplate train, also made by Marklin.

   The government should spend $13 billion over
the next decade to provide enough commercial ships for massive troop
and equipment movements should war break out, a special maritime
commission says.
   Despite that figure, the real cost to the government would be
about $5.7 billion because of the tax revenues generated by the new
ships and facilities, the Commission on Merchant Marine and Defense
said.
   The commission presented its proposals for legislative and
private action to President Bush on Thursday, but its chairman,
former GOP Sen. Jeremiah Denton, said Bush made no commitment to
seek the funds.
   The commission's proposals include a package of legislation aimed
at adding 244 ships that could be used to meet military needs. Some
of the ships would be built abroad to allow shippers to become more
quickly competitive internationally, the report said.
   Another commission member, retired Navy Adm. James L. Holloway
III, said the country probably has only 70 percent to 80 percent of
the commercial ships that might be needed in an emergency.
   ``If a crisis erupted someplace around the world, we do not have
enough ships under the American flag to support a planned
operation,'' Holloway said.
   Holloway said the maritime defense issue has not been critical in
the past because it was assumed U.S. allies could provide ships if
necessary. But he said the United States may have to ``go it
alone,'' such as it did for a time in protecting Persian Gulf
shipping.
   Troops and supplies likely would be available, he said, ``but we
don't have the sealift to move them.''
   In addition to increased ship building, the commission recommends
adding 8,208 mariners, improving ship repair yards, countering
unfair foreign trade tactics against the U.S. maritime industry and
making several reforms in laws affecting the industry.

   Efforts by California's Hollywood to get a
trademark on the name have commissioners in this south Florida city
seeing stars.
   ``We don't believe we should have to get their permission to use
our own city's name,'' Mayor Mara Giulianti said. ``We are a duly
incorporated city, and they aren't even a city.''
   If the movie capital on the Pacific Coast gets the trademark, all
other Hollywoods would have to pay to use the city name. An
exception would be made for the area within the city limits of
Hollywood, Fla.
   But City Manager Irv Rosenbaum says that's not good enough.
   ``We market tourism nationally,'' he said. ``We're the
eighth-largest city in the state. We should be able to use our name
wherever.''
   At least seven other Hollywoods _ in Alabama, Louisiana,
Maryland, Missouri, New Mexico, South Carolina and West Virginia _
would face the same problem, Giulianti said.
   The Chamber of Commerce of Hollywood, Calif., actually a district
of Los Angeles, filed for the trademark on its name Jan. 17.
   The Florida city had only until Feb. 17 to file its objection,
but has asked for a 30-day extension from the U.S. Trademarks Office.

   The winner and still heavyweight champion of
the world after the legendary ``long count'' is ... Gene Tunney.
   There were no knockdowns in the courtroom, but Tunney won a clear
verdict over Jack Dempsey from a historical judge on Wednesday. The
unofficial ruling somewhat vindicated a controversial decision by a
referee 62 years ago.
   In front of chuckling onlookers at ``ringside'' at the mock Court
of Historical Review and Appeals, Municipal Judge George T.
Choppelas declared the long-count controversy ``null and void.''
   ``Gene Tunney deserves full credit for the victory,'' the judge
said.
   Almost all the evidence was in Tunney's corner. Tunney's son,
former Sen. John V. Tunney, said the long count, in which his father
lay on the canvas for nine of the slowest counts in the history of
boxing, was ``the luckiest thing that ever happened'' to either
fighter.
   ``It kept their names in the public forum and gave added luster
to both their careers,'' Tunney said.
   If the controversy over the famous 1927 title fight was heated,
Wednesday's session was not. But that's not unusual for the Court of
Historical Review.
   The just-for-fun court, which convenes over lunch, has previously
settled such weighty issues as the origin of the martini (Martinez,
Calif.) and whether Santa Claus is real (You bet).

Namibia.
   Fanning is to hold weekend talks with Namibian police officials,
Ahtisaari said Thursday.
   Namibian police, which includes some South African officers, will
remain responsible for civil order but will be supervised by 500
U.N. police officers.
   The U.N. move into Namibia follows the Security Council's
unanimous adoption of a resolution Thursday authorizing Namibia's
independence process.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia, also known as South-West Africa,
since it captured the territory from Germany during World War I.
   Early next week, Gen. Dewan Prem Chand, the commander of the
military peacekeeping contingent, will arrive with more
administrators, said Ahtisaari.
   The Security Council set April 1 was set as the date to begin the
one-year plan for Namibia's transition to an independent, black
majority-ruled nation.
   They also approved a report by Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar that calls for sending 4,650 U.N. military peacekeepers, 500
police supervisors and at least 1,000 civilian election monitors to
Namibia.
   U.N. officials have not yet worked out which countries will
provide personnel for the peacekeeping force, but for the first time
China has offered to send up to 20 election monitors, said an Asian
diplomat.
   Perez de Cuellar has estimated the effort will cost $416 million
in its first year, making it the biggest U.N. peacekeeping mission
since the Belgian Congo operation of 1960-64, which cost more than
$400 million and involved 19,828 soldiers at its peak.
   The General Assembly on Thursday approved funds for a 70-man team
of U.N. military observers who will monitor the withdrawal of 50,000
Cuban troops from Angola as neighboring Namibia becomes independent.
   That group was budgeted at $9.2 million for this year, and a
total of $19.4 million during its entire 31-month mandate of
overseeing the Cuban withdrawal.
   In December, South Africa, Cuba and Angola signed accords at U.N.
headquarters pledging their cooperation with a southwest African
peace plan that includes the Cuban pullout and Namibian independence.
   South Africa refused to relinquish control of Namibia without the
withdrawal of the Cuban troops, saying their presence just over
Namibia's northern border could intimidate voters during the
independence process.
   All Cuban troops are to be out of Angola by July 1991.
   Cuban troops have been in Angola at that country's request since
1975 to defend it from attacks by South African troops and the
U.S.-backed rebels of the National Union for the Total Liberation of
Angola.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House narcotics committee's report on drug
use says the problem will become even graver without greater
international cooperation.
   Citing an increase in cocaine-related deaths last year, the
report said, ``With the continued influx of cocaine into this
country, the prospects for any change in this situation in the near
future are not promising.''
   The report by the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and
Control added that current estimates of the scope of drug abuse may
understate the problem.
   ``Without a concerted international commitment, including a
hemispheric drug summit, and without increased resources at home,
the future picture is bleak,'' Chairman Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said
Thursday.
   The report said indicators showed an increase last year in coca
and cocaine production and trafficking as well as greater opium and
marijuana cultivation, despite reports of stepped up eradication
efforts in some countries.
   The report catalogued a substantial haul of narcotics intercepted
by federal agencies on their way into the United States but noted
official estimates that the amount intercepted represents no more
than 5 percent to 15 percent of what comes across the border.
   ``Despite the best efforts ... drugs continue to flood our
borders because of bumper crops in producing countries,'' the report
said. It said that ``the influx of drugs places a significant burden
on federal, state and local law enforcement efforts.''
   The panel also estimated that 6 million to 6.5 million Americans
need drug abuse treatment and said there are 1.1 million to 1.3
million intravenous drug abusers.
   Currently, however, there are only about 250,000 treatment slots,
according to the committee. It said about 148,000 are for
intravenous abusers.
   ``Long waiting lists are common in many areas,'' it said.
``Moreover, there is no measure of those who are discouraged from
even applying.''
   The panel said hospital emergency rooms recorded 1,696
cocaine-related deaths last year, up from 604 such cases in 1984.

<HEAD>High-Rise Cats Survive Falls From Condos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One small step for a cat can turn into a giant leap
when the feline lives in a high-rise, but a surprising number of the
animals survive such falls, veterinarians say.
   Sheila Greenberg's fluffy brown Himalayan two years ago took the
plunge _ a 300-foot fall down 24 floors at a condominium in the
Miami area _ and today is alive and well.
   Baily suffered no fractures, according to Neil Tenzer, who
treated the feline for an internal injury.
   Sheldon Steinmetz, a North Miami Beach veterinarian, said split
palates and broken jaws are common because the cats land on their
feet and as their bodies hit, chins hit the ground.
   Their survival also seems to have a lot to do with heavy
landscaping and the ``terminal velocity'' factor. Because of their
weight and shape, cats fall at a top speed of 60 miles per hour.
Humans fall as fast as 120 mph.
   ``They're pretty incredible creatures,'' Steinmetz said.
   Veterinarian William Marks says the cats often take a leap
because of taunting by birds.
   ``The cat's out on the terrace,'' he said. ``There are birds out
on the terrace. The cat leaps at the bird. The bird flies away. The
cat keeps going.
   ``The cats are not that stupid,'' he added in their defense,
``but they are instinctive hunters.''
   Studies have been done on cats with High Rise Syndrome. In a New
York City study of 132 fallings cats, a mixed breed named Sabrina
took the record by surviving a 32-story fall to a concrete sidewalk.
She chipped a tooth.
   Baily, who may have the local record in Miami, apparently was
cushioned by trees when she fell. She was conscious and dazed, but
quite alive, when her owner rushed downstairs.
   ``We decided the cat really may know how to fly,'' Ms. Greenberg
said.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Chief Urges Curbs on Regional Bell Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators should ``unleash'' U.S.
telecommunications companies in the world marketplace but keep a
tight rein on the regional Bell companies, the chairman of American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. says.
   Robert E. Allen said Thursday that the Bell companies that were
created in the 1984 breakup of AT&amp;T are monopolies and should be
regulated as such. To allow them into the long-distance and
manufacturing arenas, as Congress and the courts are considering,
would turn back the clock on the post-1984 gains such as lower
equipment prices, lower long-distance rates and more widespread use
of telephones, he said.
   The Bell companies could potentially ``do a lot of damage to
competitors'' in markets currently protected by the 1984 consent
decree, Allen said at a meeting of the Federal Communications Bar
Association.
   ``If that happens,'' he said, ``the force of antitrust law will
be blunted. Competition may wane and consumers may suffer.''
   He said that under the decree, which prevented the regional Bell
companies from manufacturing equipment or providing long-distance or
information services, ``suppliers have flourished, spurred by the
knowledge that the (regional Bell companies) have no `inside'
manufacturer with an `inside' track.''
   Allowing them to manufacture would not improve the nation's trade
deficit or create new jobs, Allen said.
   The regional companies would be inclined to go overseas to buy
critical switches for phone equipment because of the high costs of
developing their own, Allen said.
   ``To get into this business would mean alliances between the
(regional Bell companies) and switching companies in Japan, Germany,
Sweden, France, Canada or Great Britain,'' he said.
   He said that while the United States debates the regulation
issue, foreign competitors are racing ahead, thanks to government
subsidies.
   He said he wasn't calling for subsidies but for the government to
``unleash the competitive information industry in this country.''
   ``Regulators need to act, where they are clearly free to do so,
to enhance rather than hinder the competitiveness of American
business,'' he said.
   Allen, who assumed the AT&amp;T chairmanship last April, said there
should be less regulation in competitive marketplaces such as
long-distance calling, where about 500 companies, including MCI
Communications Corp. and US Sprint, are battling AT&amp;T.
   ``In the competitive part of the industry, regulators have been
slow to remove restraints. This has denied the nation the full
benefit of all competitors being able to compete flat out. And this,
in turn, penalizes America when it needs the very best technology to
succeed in a time of intense international competition,'' he said.
   ``Divestiture worked,'' he said of the AT&amp;T breakup. ``It
promised protection of consumers by driving a clean wedge between
the monopoly markets and the competitive markets.''
   He said AT&amp;T now was just one of many communications networks in
the nation. He said it was unfair that it be regulated in a
competitive marketplace while leaders in other industries, such as
computers, are not.
   ``One is overly restrained ... the other is not restrained at
all,'' Allen said.

   News reports about a man who threatened to
sue a teacher for cutting his son's hair got the attention of police
who arrested him for failing to complete a court sentence on an
unrelated matter.
   Jack Kotnik, 34, of Elyria, was arrested Wednesday on a bench
warrant issued by Municipal Court Judge John Howard in January 1988
for allegedly failing to attend classes as part of a drunken driving
sentence.
   The arrest came after news reports about Kotnik's 7-year-old son
and a first-grade classmate who had their ``tails'' _ a long lock of
hair hanging from the nape of the neck _ cut last week by their
teacher, Katherine Abba.
   The teacher has been suspended pending an investigation.
   Meanwhile, Sharon Kimble, the mother of the other boy whose hair
was cut, said Thursday that she and her husband had decided to press
assault charges against the teacher, claiming the youngster was
bruised while being held down to have his hair cut.
   Ms. Abba initially that she had cut the students' hair as a
disciplinary measure but later declined comment on the matter. Calls
to her home Thursday went unanswered.

<HEAD>Black Can Sue Union for Emotional Distress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black firefighter who was airbrushed out
of a photograph in a union's newsletter can sue the group for
emotional distress, a Superior Court judge has ruled.
   The omission of Charles Johnson from the August 1987 photo did
not amount to a statement that was libelous or portrayed him in a
false light, said Judge Stuart Pollak, dismissing those two counts
of Johnson's suit.
   But in the ruling Wednesday, Pollak said Johnson could sue
Firefighters Local 798 and two members involved in the newsletter
for intentional infliction of emotional distress, which requires
proof of ``outrageous'' conduct.
   Johnson was one of several San Francisco firefighters honored for
a rescue effort. The photograph in the union's newsletter, Mainline,
was altered to remove Johnson, the only black and only non-union
member in the group. Johnson belongs to the Black Firefighters
Association, a separate organization.
   In his suit, he said the omission caused him humiliation and
stress that kept him off the job.
   The incident happened within a few months of the discovery of a
swastika in an office used by two minority firefighters, and the
manhandling by whites of an officer involved in a department
training program for women and minorities.
   Those episodes were cited by a federal judge who pronounced the
Fire Department ``out of control'' in January 1988. Shortly
afterward, Chief Edward Phipps resigned and was succeeded by
Frederick Postel.
   The union apologized to Johnson over the photograph but said he
was omitted only because he was not a member of the union, which has
some minority members.
   ``I have a hard time accepting the idea that a union or any other
organization has a duty to publish pictures of non-members,'' said
Duane Reno, a lawyer for Local 798. ``Even if the person does feel
left out, there should be a privilege that says the organization is
free to grant publicity to its members.''
   He said the union would make another attempt to dismiss the
emotional distress claim before trial.
   Howard Moore, Johnson's lawyer, said the suit would be redrafted
to try to reinstate the libel and ``false light'' claims.

<HEAD>Fungicide Forbidden on 42 Fruits and Vegetables</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EPA is forbidding use of the fungicide
Captan on lemons, potatoes, soybeans and 39 other crops, but other
favorites such as apples, grapes and onions are among the two-dozen
foods exempt from the new rule.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said in its announcement
Thursday that it decided against an outright ban, such as it had
proposed in 1985, because ``the benefits of some uses of Captan
outweigh the risk from dietary exposure.''
   Where it may continue to be used, the risk of a person getting
cancer from such exposure is less than one in 1 million, the agency
said. The EPA estimates that about 10 million pounds of the chemical
is used each year.
   Captan was classified by the EPA as probably causing cancer
because exposure to the chemical had caused laboratory mice and
rates to develop tumors.
   Some environmental groups have urged the government to ban the
chemical altogether and expressed disappointment in the EPA
decision. ``We are now telling people to wash their fruit and write
your congressman,'' said Rick Hind, a spokesman for the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group.
   The EPA began looking into the possible dangers of Captan in 1980
and suggested four years ago that the risk of cancer is significant
enough that a ban might be warranted,
   But John Moore, EPA's acting deputy administrator, said Thursday
that studies since 1985 have shown the health risk to be
considerably less than once thought. ``We are looking at theoretical
lifetime cancer risks that are 100 to 1,000 times lower than we
previously projected,'' he said in a statement.
   Moore said the agency's decision to allow continued use of Captan
on some food products ``is based on data which are a more realistic
reflection of the actual residues of this pesticide found in the
diet.''
   Officials said the exposure estimates used four years ago were
based on an assumption that 100 percent of each crop received
maximum exposure to the chemical. Since then actual field data have
shown the exposure estimates to be much lower, the EPA said.
   The EPA says Captan may no longer be used on: avocados, beans,
beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, culp onions, cabbage, carrots,
cantaloupes, cauliflower, celery, collards, cotton, crab apple,
cranberries, cucumber, eggplant, grapefruit, honeydew, kale, leeks,
lemons, limes, muskmelon, mustard greens, oranges, pears, peas,
pineapples, potatoes, pumpkins, quince, rhubarb, rutabaga, shallots,
soybeans, squash, sweet corn, tangerines, tomatoes, turnips and
watermelon.
   The chemical may continue to be used, although in some cases at
lower doses, on: almonds, apples, apricots, blackberries,
blueberries, celery (plant-bed only), cherries, dewberries, eggplant
(plant-bed only), grapes, green onions, lettuce, mangoes,
nectarines, peaches, pears (post harvest only), peppers, pimientos,
plums, raspberries, spinach, strawberries, taro, and tomatoes
(plant-bed only).

   Foreign submarines probed waters off
Sweden last year as often as before, but appeared to back off after
Swedish forces fired at a suspected intruder, the military said in
its annual report.
   The eight-page report that was released Thursday said, ``In spite
of a number of observations, technical indications and
well-coordinated action by anti-submarine warfare units, we have no
evidence of the nationality involved.''
   But the Svenska Dagbladet daily newspaper said the Soviet Union
was singled out in a secret appendix to the report submitted to
Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson's government.
   The Soviets have denied sending submarines into Swedish territory
since 1981 when a vessel washed onto the rocks outside a major
Swedish naval base. Moscow called that incident a mistake.
   Supreme Commander Gen. Bengt Gustafsson told reporters the
military had some ideas about the identity of the intruders, but not
enough to warrant diplomatic action.
   Naval commander Vice Admiral Bengt Schuback told a military
seminar last month there was little doubt the intruders were Soviet
vessels.
   ``They can't come from anywhere but hidden bases in the Baltic,
and we know Western countries have no such bases,'' he said.
   Gustafsson said there had been a drop in the number of intrusions
since late last year when ``the one who is violating our territorial
waters began to act more carefully'' after the government fired on
the suspected intruding sub last June off the coast.
   Gustafsson said the live-fire response followed
government-aprroved guidelines established in 1987 to prevent
intruders from escaping.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Community activists say they are heartened by
the Federal Reserve Board's decision to strengthen enforcement of a
12-year-old law forbidding loan discrimination against neighborhoods.
   The reaction Thursday followed the Fed's rejection of a request
by the Chicago-based Continental Bank Corp., the nation's 11th
largest, to purchase a small Arizona bank. It cited Continental's
lackluster record of serving poor neighborhoods as required by the
Community Reinvestment Act.
   The law, passed in 1977, is aimed at preventing ``redlining,''
the practice of denying loans to an entire neighborhood based on the
predominant race or economic class of its residents.
   Although the Fed had previously granted merger requests on the
condition that the banks applying did a better job of community
reinvestment in the future, it had never denied an application.
   ``We hope this is the beginning of a trend,'' said Allen
Fishbein, general counsel of the Center for Community Change, a
Washington-based group concerned with housing and community
development. ``For a board composed entirely of Reagan
administration appointees, this is an unprecedented step.''
   Diane Casey, director of regulatory affairs for the Independent
Bankers Association of America, said the Fed appears to be trying to
head off action in Congress, which last year considered several
measures requiring regulators to more vigorously enforce
anti-redlining laws.
   ``I think the Fed is letting Congress know that the existing law
is more than strong enough for the Fed to take action ... and that
means you don't have to go through a significant restructuring'' of
the act, she said.
   However, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas and chairman of the
House Banking Committee, said members of his panel were still very
interested in toughening the law.
   ``The interest here is still ... intense,'' he said. ``The Fed's
isolated and late awakening has to be viewed in the light of its
prior compliance or lack of compliance.''
   Continental's 14-month-old petition to acquire Grand Canyon State
Bank in Scottsdale, Ariz., was rejected on a 4-2 vote Wednesday,
with board members H. Robert Heller and John LaWare opposed. Edward
W. Kelley Jr. did not vote.
   ``We feel that the Fed has finally put teeth into the law,'' said
Michael Zucker, an international representative of the Amalgamated
Clothing and Textile Workers Union, which had lodged a formal
complaint against Continental's application.
   Zucker said Continental ``never has done a good job of lending to
the low-income and minority community of Chicago.'' He described
Grand Canyon as a ``boutique bank'' catering to affluent customers
in suburban Phoenix.
   However, Thomas C. Theobald, the chairman of Continental, said he
was ``astounded and outraged'' at the Fed's decision. ``We have an
excellent and always improving record of community support,'' he
said.
   The central bank's 10-page majority decision said, ``Given
Continental's size ... (the) bank's participation in community
development and redevelopment efforts was unsatisfactory.''
   It noted the bank has since developed a plan that should ``make
substantial contribution to correcting the past deficiencies,'' but
added, ``The board does not believe that commitments by themselves
can serve as a substitute for the established record of ...
performance.''
   The Fed also voiced concern about the bank's plan to expand while
still financed in part by and subject to the control of Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., as the result of a 1984 federal rescue.

   A U.S. human rights organization accuses the
Khmer Rouge of resorting to atrocities against Cambodian refugees
that are ``chillingly reminiscent'' of policies blamed for more than
1 million deaths in 1975-79.
   Asia Watch, a private monitoring group, said nearly 100,000
refugees are virtual prisoners in camps in Thailand but controlled
by the Khmer Rouge, the Marxist group that ruled Cambodia from 1975
into 1979.
   It said the refugees are subjected to torture, summary
executions, forced labor, denial of food and exposure to mines and
shelling.
   In the camps, ``policies that have made them international
pariahs'' are again pursued by the Khmer Rouge, Asia Watch said in a
45-page report based on recent interviews along the border and news
dispatches.
   ``Systematic human rights abuses ... and the determination to
keep refugees away from the `contaminating' influence of Western and
international aid agencies are chillingly reminiscent of the
barbarous practices that characterized Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia
from 1975-79,'' it said.
   Marked by purges, starvation and depopulation of cities, those
years became known as ``The Killing Fields'' era, the title of a
U.S. motion picture on the period.
   ``The international community must now insist that refugees in
Khmer Rouge-controlled camps be allowed to choose whether they wish
to remain in those camps or be transferred elsewhere,'' it said.
   The report was issued Thursday, on the eve of weekend diplomatic
talks in Jakarta, Indonesia, aimed at ending the 10-year Vietnamese
occupation of Cambodia that ended Khmer Rouge rule.
   Asia Watch said recent Khmer Rouge activities suggest a coming
bid to regain power in Cambodia, and that Thailand should be
persuaded to crack down against the group.
   The United States, numerous human rights organizations, and Asian
governments participating in the Jakarta talks all have declared
opposition to a return of Khmer Rouge control.
   The report said there is a danger that protection of the
Cambodian refugees will be overlooked during fast-paced diplomatic
activity on Cambodia involving China, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   ``A change in Thai government policy is the first step,'' Asia
Watch said. ``International pressure on Thailand to establish and
enforce international access to all refugee camps is ... essential.''
   The Thais, seeking to use the Khmer Rouge ``as a buffer between
the Thai military and Vietnamese forces inside Cambodia, have
acquiesced in the Khmer Rouge's refusal to let civilians who wish to
do so leave camps under its control,'' it said.
   But a new phase of the conflict, with prospects for Vietnamese
withdrawal and solution of Cambodia's external problems, no longer
justifies this, it added.
   Asia Watch said the Khmer Rouge depend on Thailand for food, arms
and other logistical support.
   ``Weapons supply to the Khmer Rouge and the transfer of these
weapons across the Thai border into Cambodia should be terminated
immediately,'' it said. ``It is clear from ... its efforts to
stockpile weapons inside Cambodia that the Khmer Rouge is preparing
for a protracted war.''
   Asia Watch described teen-agers and women forced to carry weapons
and ammunition from Thailand across heavily mined frontier zones
into Cambodia, with heavy casualties, denial of medical care and
abandonment of the crippled.
   Between last June and November, the Khmer Rouge attempted to
shift 15,000 refugees to Cambodia from widely separated locations in
Thailand, it said, indicating ``they were part of a central policy''
probably ordered by leaders Pol Pot and Ieng Sary ``who observers
believe continue to be the primary decision-makers.''

   A former mental patient who killed three
co-workers this week before committing suicide showed no signs of
being potentially violent when he was released from the hospital in
1986, doctors say.
   ``I have found nothing that would make me question the release
decision made two years ago,'' said Stephen Siebert, acting director
of Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center, a Maryland state mental
hospital.
   Emanuel Tsegaye, 33, described by police as ``a disgruntled
employee,'' shot four co-workers, three fatally, and then killed
himself Wednesday afternoon in the seventh floor offices of Chevy
Chase Federal Savings Bank in Bethesda, Md.
   Just a week before the shooting, a therapist who met with Tsegaye
every two weeks reported that he was adhering to the terms of his
conditional release from the mental institution, Siebert said.
   Perkins officials, aided by outside consultants, are reviewing
the incident, Siebert said. Authorities says they have not
determined the motive for the shootings or how Tsegaye was able to
obtain a gun.
   The three bank employees who were killed were identified as
Cynthia Mitchell, 28, of Landover, Md.; Tanya Walker, 23, of Fort
Washington, Md.; and Mahasty Agha-Khan, 29, of Silver Spring, Md.
   Edward Johnson, 22, who was shot in the jaw, survived the attack
but was listed in critical condition at Suburban Hospital in
Bethesda.
   Tsegaye had been hospitalized for depression five times in his
life, Siebert said, beginning in 1979 in his native Ethiopia. The
first four hospitalizations were brief.
   But a county circuit judge committed Tsegaye to Perkins in April
1984 after he threatened a police officer with a dull butter knife
and begged him to kill him, according to Perkins records.
   Tsegaye, who was declared not criminally responsible for the
attack, was diagnosed as suffering from bipolar syndrome, which
caused him to experience extreme bouts of depression, Siebert said.
If anything, said Siebert, Tsegaye was considered a threat to
himself, but not to other people.
   ``He was in for a suicidal gesture, not violent behavior,'' said
Siebert.
   A treatment team evaluated Tsegaye in 1986 and deemed him ready
for conditional release, a decision supported by an outside mental
health professional and by the judge who had committed him. Tsegaye
remained on medication and lived in several transition houses before
eventually moving into an apartment in Silver Spring, according to
Siebert.
   The bank was not informed of Tsegaye's psychiatric history
because of what hospital officials considered his right to privacy,
said Siebert, who pointed out that state law does not require such
notification. He said one person in 20 suffers from some form of
bi-polar syndrome, and 99 percent never become violent.

<HEAD>Customs Issues Alert For Fraudulent Flags</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Customs Service has ordered closer scrutiny
of American flags from a Taiwanese company that suggested that its
U.S. customers replace ``Made in Taiwan'' tags with ``Made in USA.''
   The order followed complaints from American flag manufacturers
and several members of Congress.
   William Rosenblatt, assistant commissioner in Customs' Office of
Enforcement, said Thursday that ``an alert has been issued to all
ports to closely examine inspections from this importer,'' the Ming
Teh Flag Co. of Taipei, Taiwan.
   In addition, ``Customs is initiating an investigation to
determine if markings have been changed after importation,''
Rosenblatt said in a letter to Rep. Douglas Applegate, D-Ohio.
   The label-switching possibility was raised by Ming Teh in a
letter it wrote soliciting business from a U.S. company.
   ``We can realize why you need to lift off this label ... to
prevent the resistance in U.S. to import flags,'' the letter said.
``If possible, we suggest you cut off this label after you receive
the goods and spend very little cost to mark on the flags your own
brand name and Made in U.S.A. signs.''
   The solicitation added, ``We can offer the labels too.''
   Applegate was among the lawmakers who received a copy of the
solicitation as part of a complaint campaign by domestic flag makers.
   The office of Rep. Harley Staggers, D-W.Va. said it forwarded the
same complaint to Customs back in June, but was told it is very
difficult to enforce the country-of-origin marking laws after items
have cleared Customs.
   Staggers was author of legislation seeking to ban all imports of
U.S. flags. That legislation died at the end of the last session,
but the lawmaker is preparing to reintroduce it.
   Customs also has forwarded a copy of the Taiwanese flag
solicitation to the Federal Trade Commission, which, if evidence of
label-switching is uncovered, could go to court to stop the practice.
   In addition, if any domestic manufacturer could show it lost
business to a label-switching competitor, federal law would enable
the company to recover the lost profit and legal costs.
   If a packaged flag, complete with trim, pole, etc., contains more
than half American-made components, distributors can legally strip
tags that say ``Made In Taiwan,'' ``Made In Singapore'' or the like.
But ``they can't say `Made in USA' unless it's made in the U.S.A.,''
said Robert Easton, a special assistant for enforcement in the FTC
Bureau of Consumer Protection.

<HEAD>Affluent County to Use Drug-Sniffing Dogs, Metal Detectors in Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the most affluent counties in the
nation is turning to drug-sniffing dogs and metal detectors in an
attempt to stem the flow of drugs and weapons into its high schools.
   ``These are precautionary measures in the system to make sure the
parents and community feel comfortable,'' Fairfax County
Superintendent Robert Spillane said Thursday.
   The action comes after several recent incidents involving weapons
at Washington, D.C.-area schools. An affluent suburb of the nation's
capital, Fairfax County is the largest school district in the
Washington area.
   Metal detectors will be used when administrators have
``reasonable cause'' to believe a student has a weapon, said Deputy
Superintendent Doris Torice.
   Principals will decide when and how often to use drug-sniffing
dogs. Entire halls or buildings will be inspected, not just
individual students, officials said.

   Efforts by California's Hollywood to get a
trademark on the name have commissioners in this south Florida city
seeing stars.
   ``We don't believe we should have to get their permission to use
our own city's name,'' Mayor Mara Giulianti said. ``We are a duly
incorporated city, and they aren't even a city.''
   If the movie capital on the Pacific Coast gets the trademark, all
other Hollywoods would have to pay to use the city name. An
exception would be made for the area within the city limits of
Hollywood, Fla.
   But City Manager Irv Rosenbaum says that's not good enough.
   ``We market tourism nationally,'' he said. ``We're the
eighth-largest city in the state. We should be able to use our name
wherever.''
   At least seven other Hollywoods _ in Alabama, Louisiana,
Maryland, Missouri, New Mexico, South Carolina and West Virginia _
would face the same problem, Giulianti said.
   The Chamber of Commerce of Hollywood, Calif., actually a district
of Los Angeles, filed for the trademark on its name Jan. 17.
   The Florida city had only until Feb. 17 to file its objection,
but has asked for a 30-day extension from the U.S. Trademarks Office.

   The winner and still heavyweight champion of
the world after the legendary ``long count'' is ... Gene Tunney.
   There were no knockdowns in the courtroom, but Tunney won a clear
verdict over Jack Dempsey from a historical judge on Wednesday. The
unofficial ruling somewhat vindicated a controversial decision by a
referee 62 years ago.
   In front of chuckling onlookers at ``ringside'' at the mock Court
of Historical Review and Appeals, Municipal Judge George T.
Choppelas declared the long-count controversy ``null and void.''
   ``Gene Tunney deserves full credit for the victory,'' the judge
said.
   Almost all the evidence was in Tunney's corner. Tunney's son,
former Sen. John V. Tunney, said the long count, in which his father
lay on the canvas for nine of the slowest counts in the history of
boxing, was ``the luckiest thing that ever happened'' to either
fighter.
   ``It kept their names in the public forum and gave added luster
to both their careers,'' Tunney said.
   If the controversy over the famous 1927 title fight was heated,
Wednesday's session was not. But that's not unusual for the Court of
Historical Review.
   The just-for-fun court, which convenes over lunch, has previously
settled such weighty issues as the origin of the martini (Martinez,
Calif.) and whether Santa Claus is real (You bet).

   The Soviet Union exploded a nuclear device with a
yield of up to 20 kilotons Friday to investigate what happens during
an atomic explosion, the official Tass news agency reported.
   The underground nuclear test occurred at Semipalatinsk, in the
Soviet Central Asian republic of Kazakkstan, at 7:01 a.m. Moscow
time (11 p.m. EST Thursday), Tass said.
   It said the device exploded had a yield equivalent to 20,000 tons
of TNT, or the power of the U.S. atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in
1945.
   Tass said the test was designed ``to check the results of
research in the field of the physics of a nuclear explosion,'' but
gave no more details.
   Radiation levels in and around the Semipalatinsk test site were
normal, Tass said.

<HEAD>Shares Hit Record High, Dollar Edges Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices reversed an earlier trend to close the
week at a record high Friday, while the U.S. dollar edged lower as
dealers waited in anticipation of an American trade report scheduled
for release later in the day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 65.90-point
loser the previous day, won back 89.81 points, or 0.28 percent, for
32,173.39 by the end of the trading week.
   In foreign exchange dealings, the dollar closed at 125.72 yen,
down 0.61 yen from Thursday's 126.33-yen finish. It traded in a
tight range of 125.50-125.90 yen during the day.
   Dealers said the market's main economic barometer suffered a late
morning slump when it shed a minor 1.36 points after jumping over
100 points shortly after the exchange opened. The index again picked
up steam in the afternoon session before finishing the week at yet
another high.
   The previous record was set Wednesday when the Nikkei closed at
32,149.48.
   Dealers said market participants were refraining from making
strong moves ahead of American trade figures scheduled for release
by the U.S Commerce Department later Friday, Tokyo time.
   They expect the December trade deficit to total $11 billion to
$12 billion, slightly lower from November's $12.5 billion, the
dealers added.
   ``The dollar is a lot weaker than I thought,'' said a dealer with
a major securities firm. ``It came under selling pressure once it
broke the 128.00-yen level,'' he added, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``If the trade deficit is over $12 billion, the U.S. currency is
likely to weaken even more.''

<HEAD>Global Aviation Group To Study Airline Anti-Terrorism Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A worldwide aviation agency will study ways to
screen radios, tape players and other seemingly harmless devices
that could be used to smuggle a terrorist bomb aboard an airplane.
   The 33-nation council of the International Civil Aviation
Organization ordered the study the same day British authorities in
Lockerbie, Scotland, said the bomb that brought down Pan Am Flight
103 was hidden in a radio-cassette player.
   U.S. and British aviation authorities requested the two-day
session that concluded Thursday in Montreal following the Dec. 21
bombing over Scotland that killed 259 people on the plane and 11 on
the ground.
   The council ordered its staff to investigate what measures could
be taken to prevent further terrorist sabotage aboard aircraft, and
said it will make those recommendations in several months to the
160-member International Civil Aviation Organization, the air
affiliate of the United Nations.
   The council condemned ``all acts of unlawful interference against
international civil aviation'' and urged member nations to intensify
their air travel safeguards.
   ``A concrete plan of action was agreed to by the members of ICAO,
which was our goal,'' U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel K.
Skinner said at a closing news conference.
   British Transportation Secretary Paul Channon described the
meeting as marking ``a new era of international cooperation to
combat the terrorist threat in civil aviation.''
   A resolution adopted by the council commits the organization to
review whether more intensive measures are needed to detect sabotage
devices, especially explosives.
   It urges quicker research and development on detection of
explosives and on security equipment.
   The organization's staff also will be considering whether new
steps are needed to increase the matching of passengers and their
bags as a security measure, to consider the security problem of
cargo, mail and courier services using passenger aircraft, and the
issue of controlling access to airports.
   The staff also will be looking at the security problems posed by
radios, computers and other electronic equipment in which explosives
or components can be hidden.
   Channon, speaking at an earlier news conference Thursday after
the announcement of the latest findings in the Flight 103
investigation, said, ``This is further evidence of the extent of
this serious problem.''
   ``To ban radios altogether would be a very drastic step,'' the
British official said. He said, however, it is a question that may
have to be considered.
   Allan McArtor, the outgoing administrator of the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration, said new guidelines were issued Thursday in
Washington after the Lockerbie announcement.
   ``The guidance is more a sense of vigilance than anything else,''
he told reporters. ``To be extra vigilant, possibly X-ray in two
dimension to look for hidden cavities.''
   McArtor said that while passengers can expect their electronic
equipment to be checked more rigorously, an outright ban on carrying
them is unlikely.
   ``I have not asked for any banning of electronic equipment nor
have I heard it,'' he said.
   The organization's staff also will be considering whether
comprehensive screening of checked baggage and the screening or
passengers and hand baggage need new standards or recommendations.
   The organization's president, Assad Kotai, said he hoped that
most points could be handled this year. The organization's general
meeting is in September.
   ``We have to strengthen further our preventive measures,'' Kotai
said.

   Tokyo dealers took to the sidelines today as the
U.S. dollar shed ground against the Japanese yen, while active
buying propelled the market's main economic barometer to another
record closing.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues started with more
than a 100-point surge at the onset of trading, but fizzled out
toward the end of the morning after profit-taking by investors. By
the end of the early session, the index, a 65.90-point loser
Thursday, had shed a marginal 1.36 points.
   Led by active buying of large-capital issues, the Nikkei regained
momentum in the afternoon session and managed to win back 89.91
points, or 0.28 percent, during the two hours of trading. It closed
the week at 32,173.39 points, a record finish.
   The previous high was set Wednesday when the index finished at
32,149.48 points.
   In foreign exchange dealings, the dollar closed at 125.72 yen,
down 0.61 yen from Thursday's 126.33-yen finish. It was traded in a
tight range of 125.50-125.90 yen during the day.
   The U.S. currency had opened at a lower 125.90 yen following
losses in overseas markets, and one dealer said the dollar came
under strong selling pressure after it broke the 125.80-yen level,
which he described as ``a technical point.''
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the dealer added that
movement of the dollar against the yen next week will depend on what
the American trade deficit figure for December totals.
   The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to release the figure
in Washington later today and many local economists have predicted
it to be slightly lower than November's $12.5 billion.
   But ``if the trade deficit is over $12 billion, the U.S. currency
is likely to weaken even more,'' the dealer said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increasing numbers of visitors from Europe and
Japan helped boost foreign tourism in the United States by 14
percent last year.
   The U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration also said Thursday
that tourism is expected to continue to grow in the next two years,
although not at such a quick pace.
   The agency estimates that visits to the United States for
business and pleasure reached a record 33.7 million in 1988 and
projected there will be 35.8 million foreign visitors this year and
37.2 million in 1990.
   Visits by Europeans increased 24 percent last year to 5.8
million, with the increase paced by a 34 percent jump in visits from
Britain. Visits from Japan also were up 24 percent, to 2.6 million.

   Population experts say Islam is the world's
fastest growing religion and predict the world's Moslem population
could double to 1.9 billion people by the year 2020.
   John R. Weeks, who directs the International Population Center at
San Diego State University in California, and Saad Gadalla, its
technical director, said Thursday that about 42 babies are born to
every 1,000 people in Moslem countries each year.
   That compares with fewer than 34 in other Third World countries
and only 13 in the western industrial world.
   The writers said in a study, ``The Demography of Islamic
Nations,'' that the growth would boost the Moslem world's share of
humanity from the current 18 percent to 25 percent by the year 2020.

   House Speaker Jim Wright postponed until after
President Bush's trip to Asia a floor vote on legislation that would
require disclosure of foreign property ownership in this country.
   The House had been set to vote next Thursday on the bill, which
would require foreign owners of American property to provide
information about their holdings to the government.
   But Wright's office said Thursday that the White House indicated
it hoped there would be no vote on the bill until after Bush returns
from next week's trip to Japan, China and Korea.
   The Reagan administration and various business critics said last
year that the measure would stifle vitally needed foreign investment
and hurt business in other ways.

   The leaders of Iraq, Jordan, Egypt and
North Yemen have signed a new alliance to improve economic ties.
   King Hussein of Jordan called the Arab Cooperation Council,
formed Thursday at a summit in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, ``yet
another link in the chain of Arab efforts toward integration,'' the
official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   President Saddam Hussein read the agreement aloud to a cheering
crowd in Baghdad's Grand Festivals Square, the agency said. Also
signing the 17-article accord were King Hussein, President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt and President Ali Abdullah Saleh of North Yemen.
   Officials of the four nations have said the alliance is intended
solely to improve economic ties and has no military or political
purpose that would compete with the 22-member Arab League.
   They said it was similar to the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council and another bloc that may be formed in North Africa by
Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria and Mauritania.
   The main goal of the Arab Cooperation Council is ``to achieve the
highest degree of cooperation, coordination, integration and
solidarity among the member states,'' the agency quoted the
agreement as saying.
   It said Iraq was elected president for the first year.
   Western diplomats and political analysts in Baghdad said there
was no indication the new alliance would pose a military threat to
Israel.
   They noted Egypt is bound by its 1979 peace treaty with Israel
and the others have supported moves toward a settlement of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.

   A full-page newspaper advertisement calling on
Episcopalians to take a stand against women priests gives a rallying
point to people who are unhappy with changes in the church, one of
the campaign's supporters says.
   ``We are letting people know that they do not have to go along
with all this trendy stuff,'' said the Rev. Titus Oates, rector of
Boston's All Saints Episcopal Church.
   Oates is a member of the Evangelical and Catholic Mission that
gave a test-run Thursday to the ad in the Boston Herald. The ad was
aimed at the diocese that last week consecrated Bishop Barbara C.
Harris as the first woman bishop in the Anglican Communion's
450-year history.
   ``Episcopalians! Do Something,'' read the ad, which included a
litany of demands, including the mission's belief that priests
should be male. The ad asks readers to sign and return to the group
a ``declaration of common faith and purpose,'' and encourages
readers to attend a synod planned this June by the Fort Worth,
Texas-based mission, a conservative Episcopal group.
   The ad was the latest note of discord sounded since Harris was
elected as bishop last September, a position that gave her entry
into an apostolic succession that the church traces back to the time
of Christ.
   At Harris' consecration as suffragan, or assistant bishop, two
men spoke against the ordination, including one who termed it
sacrilege. But the congregation of about 8,000 roared its approval
when asked if their will was that she be ordained.
   The 58-year-old Episcopal priest from Philadelphia has generated
controversy because of her gender, her lack of formal seminary
degrees, her divorced status and her tenure as former publisher of
the distinctly liberal Episcopal publication, The Witness.
   Many church leaders saw Thursday's ad as no threat to Harris'
position.
   ``In one sense it's good copy and is a way for them to fly their
flag,'' said Diane Spence, director of development at the Episcopal
Divinity School in Cambridge.
   Architects of the campaign say the ads will run elsewhere in the
country this spring.
   Canon Brien Koehler of the Evangelical and Catholic Mission said
it is unlikely the Episcopal Church will reverse its 10-year policy
of allowing women into the priesthood. But he said the June synod is
intended to ``find a way to allow ourselves to live and breathe
within the Episcopal Church. Whether the official channels of the
Episcopal Church will tolerate that, I think that's really a great
question right now.''
   Officials of the 96,000-member Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts
said they had no comment on the ad.
   Spokesman Jim Solheim also said Harris was aware of the ad and
had no comment.
   At a news conference after her election had been formally
approved by Episcopal bishops around the country, Harris
acknowledged that some church members would have difficulty with her
position, but said she doubted a schism would result.

   Tens of thousands of Moroccans welcomed
the leaders of five North African nations who are holding a summit
to create a common market known as the Great Magreb.
   ``This union is only the first stage toward a union of all Arab
countries,'' Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi told leaders of Algeria,
Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia at the opening session Thursday.
   They proposed to finalize their treaty today following prayers in
Marrakech's nearly 1,000-year-old Kotoubia Mosque.
   The outlines of the future union remain general, but summit
sources said the leaders want the new union to enable their
countries to hold their own in dealing with the European Economic
Community.
   King Hassan II on Thursday said the nations are realizing ``a
dream that North Africans have had for generations.''
   Outside the meeting in Marrakech City Hall, more than 20,000
people cheered the leaders.
   Col. Gadhafi announced that a second summit conference of what is
being called the ``Arab Union of the Great Maghreb'' would take
place in Libya's capital, Tripoli, on Sept. 1. The day is also the
20th anniversary of the coup that brought him to power.
   Gadhafi also hoped that someday ``other African countries,
particularly Sudan, Chad, Mali and Niger'' would join the union.
   Gadhafi has proposed integrating the defense forces of the five
countries, but none of the other four summit nations has shown an
interest in the move.
   Within the union, all goods would move freely, and there would be
separate agreements on the free movement of their citizens,
unification of currencies, and economic relations with the outside
world.
   But each country would retain its national sovereignty.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, the leaders of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and North
Yemen signed an accord Thursday also to create an economic alliance,
an official Iraqi report said.
   Their alliance, called the Arab Cooperation Council, is designed
to boost Arab unity, the Iraqi News Agency said.

<HEAD>Government Acknowledges Stroessner's Police Had Torture Chambers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH LOVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new interior minister acknowledged
that police under ousted President Alfredo Strossner had torture
chambers, but he said they would be dismantled soon, a newspaper
reported.
   The comments by Gen. Orlando Machuca Vargas followed accusations
in recent years by Paraguay's Roman Catholic Church and human rights
organizations that Gen. Stroessner used torture to repress political
opposition.
   In an interview with the newspaper El Diario Noticias, Machuca
Vargas was quoted as saying his ministry would crack down on rights
violations by police.
   ``We are going to eliminate torture chambers in police stations
since they do nothing for the image of the country and are degrading
to the human condition,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The interior minister declined to give details of the ``torture
chambers'' but said they will be shut down, probably ``within a
month.''
   Stroessner was deposed Feb. 3 in a coup by Gen. Andres Rodriguez,
who named himself provisional president, appointed a new Cabinet,
and accepted the governing Colorado Party's endorsement for
president in elections set for May 1. About 50 people were killed in
the coup, the government said.
   Human rights groups said Stroessner's forces frequently used
torture.
   After he consolidated power following a 1954 coup, Stroessner
eased up on the most blatant human rights violations, replacing
murder and torture with harassment, detentions and expulsions, the
rights groups charged.
   Machuca Vargas said members of the investigative police agency,
which long has been accused of torturing political and criminal
prisoners, will be prosecuted if formal complaints are lodged.
   ``We will investigate all the irregularities committed by
employees of this ministry,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We're not
going to cover up for anybody. ... Our mission is to clean up the
image of the Interior Ministry as being a repressive organ of the
government.''
   In a separate development, a judge ordered the release of a
Chilean convicted of being an accomplice in the September 1980
assassination of exiled Nicaraguan president Anastasio Somoza.
   Rafael Mella Latorre was arrested in October 1980, 47 days after
Somoza's car was blasted by a bazooka in a residential neighborhood
of this capital city.
   ``I'm emphatic in saying I had no participation in that. I was a
scapegoat of authorities in charge of the custody of Somoza,'' Mella
Latorre told reporters.
   ``The investigative police tortured me for almost seven months.
They even tortured my pregnant wife in my presence, causing a
miscarriage,'' he said.
   Mella Latorre was scheduled to be released in 1986 after being
convicted and sentenced to six years in prison, but prison officials
accused him of participating in a prison riot that January. Judge
Tito Medina decreed his release after a witness testified Mella
Latorre was not involved.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of Prime Minister Benezir
Bhutto may be trying to undermine her goverment by using the rage of
a novel that allegedly blasphemes Islam.
   The furor over ``The Satanic Verses'' caused the most violent
demonstration in the Pakistani capital in a decade and occurred
while Ms. Bhutto was in China on her first official trip abroad as
prime minister.
   ``If the real purpose of the demonstration was only to protest
the book, it came at an odd time and an odd place,'' said a retired
bureaucrat who served under both Ms. Bhutto's father, the late Prime
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who
overthrew Bhutto in 1977.
   On Sunday, young Moslems following religious leaders and
political opponents of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party marched
on the U.S. Information Center in Islamabad to demand that the
United States, a close ally of Pakistan, ban the book.
   A rock-throwing mob smashed windows, tore down the American flag
and started small fires in the building.
   Police responded with tear gas and gunfire. Six people were shot
to death and more than 80 were injured.
   Ms. Bhutto said the violence appeared to be the work of her
political rivals and accused them of trying to whip up sentiment
against the 2-month-old government.
   Pakistan already had joined Iran, India, Bangladesh, Egypt and
South Africa in banning the novel.
   An editorial in The Frontier Post, an English-language newspaper
that often supports the Bhutto party, declared: ``The path of
confrontation ... is being followed by people who either do not
accept the democratic way of life or are not happy with the results
of the general elections and now wish to destabilize the popularly
elected government.''
   Organizers of the protest said the timing had nothing to do with
Ms. Bhutto's absence in China, but was prompted by reviews of the
book that appeared in international news magazines a few days
earlier.
   A government official said privately: ``The reviews had the first
details anyone had about the book. Nobody here has read the book.''
   A religious issue could bring together followers of Zia, who won
the support of Moslem fundamentalist parties by espousing Islamic
law for Pakistan. The program had made little headway by the time
Zia was killed in a plane crash in August.
   Zia's political heirs ran in November's elections as the
eight-party Islamic Democratic Alliance, with adoption of Islamic
law as a major part of their platform. Ms. Bhutto has shunned
Islamization as a relic of the Zia years.
   Her party, founded by her father, won the popular vote nearly 2-1
in Pakistan's first free elections since the 1977 coup. It fell
short of a majority in Parliament, however, and she formed a
coalition with small parties and independents.
   Ms. Bhutto's lack of a majority has led to several confrontations
with the conservatives, the most notable over her attempt to repeal
a constitutional amendment Zia enacted giving the president broad
discretionary powers.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' offends their faith by
satirizing the prophet Mohammed as fallible and implying that Islam
is not the only true religion.
   Author Salman Rushdie, a British citizen who was born in India to
Moslem parents, says the work is not blasphemous.

   A fire in the southeastern city of Mergui
destroyed 3,900 buildings and left 22,000 residents homeless,
official sources said today.
   There was no report on casualties or the cause of Thursday's
inferno, which sources said caused an estimated $50 million damage.
   Among the structures destroyed were two schools, three movie
theaters, a section of a hospital and a government office building.
   The blaze broke out at 3 p.m. and lasted until midnight.
   Mergui, 350 miles southeast of Rangoon, is a prosperous business
center with a wealthy Chinese-Burmese community.
   Several large fires have swept through Burma's provincial centers
in recent years, in part because many buildings are wooden.

<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Khomeini has made a religious
mistake in sending death squads after the author of ``The Satanic
Verses,'' a leading Islamic theologian said.
   Executing Salman Rushdie would be ``virtually impossible'' under
the tenets of Islam and such a death order is ``a wrong ruling''
from a theological point of view, said Sheik Mohammed Hossam-el-Din
of Cairo's Al-Azhar institute.
   Hossam-el-Din said Thursday that the book should be banned and
burned, but that nobody has been executed in Islam's 1,350-year
history as an apostate, which he interpreted as the crime Khomeini
invoked in his death sentence.
   Khomeini said the Indian-born author deserved to die for
insulting Islam.
   Rushdie, born into a wealthy Moslem family in Bombay, says he
does not believe in ``supernatural entities'' but insists his book
is not slanderous.
   The 1,013-year-old Al-Azhar is considered the Moslem world's
center of theology, combining a university and mosque whose
officials are appointed by the government.
   Khomeini's execution order and unrest in Pakistan, India and Iran
over the book's publication make ``Islam seem brutal and
bloodthirsty,'' said Hossam-el-Din.
   He said there are four steps to follow with someone suspected of
being an apostate before passing a death sentence:
   _ A formal court questions the defendant on his motivation and
whether his alleged offense was meant to signify rejection of Islam.
   _ Once held to be an apostate, the defendant is given a week to
repent.
   _ Barring repentance, he is sentenced to death. The only
authority enabled to pass such a sentence, however, is a Moslem
ruler with jurisdiction over the defendant.
   _ Finally, if the defendant changes his mind and eventually
repents at any time before his execution _ even the second before
death _ he is absolved and released.
   ``So you see, it's really impossible to execute an apostate
because the defendant will always repent,'' Hossam-el-Din said.
   ``Whoever understands Islam will realize that the penalty for
apostacy cannot be implemented. In the history of Islam, there has
never been any individual case of executing an apostate, only wars
against them.''
   He said he has not read the book but that Al-Azhar officials have
received reports and excerpts from Moslem clerics in London.

<HEAD>Mrs. Mandela's Image Tarnished by Controversies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three years ago, anti-apartheid
leaders launched a campaign to promote black activist Winnie Mandela
as ``the mother of the nation'' and a symbol of resistance to
government repression.
   Since then, her image has been tarnished by controversies over
her lifestyle, public statements and involvement with a group of
youths who have been accused of crimes.
   In recent weeks, the wife of jailed African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela has been linked with alleged beatings of black
activists, disappearances and the death of a 14-year-old boy.
   On Thursday, black leaders of major anti-apartheid organizations
publicly abandoned and condemned her. They told of many attempts to
reconcile the conflict between Mrs. Mandela and the black community,
and said they were outraged by her ``complicity'' in abductions and
assault.
   The government, which isolated and banned her for nearly 23
years, has run several TV news programs on her troubles.
   As far as the government is concerned, the most effective way of
discrediting Mrs. Mandela may have been its 1986 decision to lift
the ban on quoting her and remove all restrictions on her
activities. The government has exploited Mrs. Mandela's foibles in
its propaganda war against her husband. But in many cases, she has
provided the ammunition.
   Public reports of battles between her bodyguards and other Soweto
youth groups go back to January, 1987 when police questioned her
about the death of one of the young men who congregate at her home
under the name of the Mandela United soccer team. She formed the
team in 1986, saying the youths were getting into trouble and she
wanted to get them off the streets. They have played few soccer
games.
   For two years her name has been popping up in court cases
involving charges of assault, murder and robbery by people alleged
to have stayed at her house or used her car and van. Police
occasionally have announced they were investigating charges against
her, but have never brought her to court.
   Anti-apartheid newspapers sometimes delayed for weeks printing
negative stories about her or her bodyguards for fear of being used
in an anti-Winnie Mandela propaganda campaign. But journalists have
grown increasingly uneasy about Mrs. Mandela's refusal to comment on
the events and her continued support of the unpopular Mandela
United, whose members have threatened reporters and photographers as
well as residents of Soweto.
   For years she was known as the courageous, stubborn wife of
Mandela, fighting small battles in the conservative farming town of
Brandfort where she was banished. She received a steady stream of
international visitors and issued statements on Mandela that could
not be published in South Africa.
   Her prominence soared in late 1985 after her Brandfort house was
burned and she challenged the government directly by moving back to
Soweto, the largest black township.
   She had not been quoted in South African papers since 1975, but
suddenly she was at almost every major rally, wearing ANC colors,
her fist raised, supporting the anti-government protests and making
radical statements.
   The government, without explaining why, lifted the ban on quoting
her shortly after she made one of the most controversial
pronouncements of her life. At a rally in the township of Kagiso,
Mrs. Mandela said, ``With our boxes of matches, and our necklaces,
we shall liberate this country.''
   The exiled leadership of the African National Congress
disassociated itself from the statement. But her declaration was
seen by the government as proof the ANC supported the ``necklace,''
a burning tire around the neck that was used on suspected black
collaborators.
   The Mandelas married in 1958, when she was a 24-year-old social
worker and he was a 40-year-old executive member of the African
National Congress.
   After the ANC was banned in 1960 and her husband went
underground, Mrs. Mandela spent 17 years under banning orders, in
solitary confinement, on trial or under house arrest, while raising
two daughters.
   In 1977, she was banished to Brandfort, where she started a
clinic and day-care center.
   She returned to Soweto amid the national uprising in black
townships, breaking her bans on public appearances and speeches. She
said she spoke for the nation's jailed black leaders and for the ANC.
   Friends suggested police did not act against her because of the
growing world focus on the Mandelas as a symbol of black resistance
to apartheid.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said last week that police
were careful not to be seen as vindictive toward Mrs. Mandela. But
he also said it was hard to get a case against her because witnesses
who were willing to testify later changed their minds or
disappeared. She has not been charged with a crime since December
1985 when she was accused of violating her banishment order.
   She was widely criticized for building a mansion on a Soweto
hill, which she said was for Mandela when he left prison. Sources
close to the ANC said Mandela sent word he would never live in the
house, and it has not been occupied.
   She never spoke publicly about the burning of her house in July.
Through his attorney, Mandela said no retaliation should be taken
against local high school students who had torched the house in a
fight with her soccer team.
   Black leaders in Soweto formed a crisis committee after the arson
to defuse tension and act as a conduit for complaints about the
soccer team. Mrs. Mandela became more isolated when she broke off
contact with long-time family lawyers, argued with the committee and
remained surrounded by her bodyguards.
   In September 1987, the ANC expressed concern about statements
made by Mrs. Mandela, noting she held no position in the
organization. Celebrating the ANC's 75th anniversary, the
organization issued a list of ``Heroines of the Struggle.'' Winnie
Mandela was not on it.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legal loophole is permitting a U.S. diplomat
to continue drawing his $63,434-a-year salary despite his conviction
for using his diplomatic passport to avoid paying import duties on
smuggled gold, a published report says.
   David W. Devin, 44, remains on the government payroll despite
pleading guilty nearly four months ago, The Washington Post reported
today. The career Foreign Service officer was sentenced Thursday to
six months in prison and a $15,000 fine.
   The 1980 Foreign Service Act requires that Devin, who was a
project director in Indonesia with the Agency for International
Development, be given a hearing before a grievance board before he
can be fired by the government, the newspaper reported.
   Had he been in the civil service rather than the diplomatic
service, personnel administrators could have moved for his
suspension without pay within 10 days of arrest or indictment, AID
lawyer Carl Sosebee.
   Devin promises to make the grievance hearing a lengthy procedure
vowing to fight his dismissal because ``some sharks'' were trying to
force him from the agency. ``I'm not trying to take advantage of the
law. The law was set up for situations such as these,'' he told the
newspaper.
   AID officials acknowledge that Devin, who is on administrative
leave with pay, could continue to collect his salary in prison if he
has not had a hearing before he begins serving his sentence.
   No date has been set for Devin's hearing or for him to begin his
prison stay.

<HEAD>Embattled Navajo Chairman Takes Leave of Absence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navajo tribal chairman Peter MacDonald
has taken a leave of absence amid allegations that he accepted
kickbacks, but it was unclear today who will lead the nation's
largest Indian tribe.
   MacDonald's decision Thursday came a week after witnesses told a
U.S. Senate committee that MacDonald demanded trips, gifts and other
favors as a part of awarding contracts and other tribal business.
   Phoenix real estate agent Byron ``Bud'' Brown testified on Feb. 7
that he helped arrange a Navajo ranch purchase in July 1987 for
$33.4 million from an oilman who had paid $26.2 million for the
ranch hours earlier.
   Brown, who has been granted immunity from prosecution, said he
gave MacDonald $75,000 and a luxury car as his share of the profit.
   MacDonald, who acknowledges accepting gifts but denies
wrongdoing, announced his intention to step down during an emotional
speech to the 88-member Tribal Council. He appealed for tribal unity
and asked for access to records to defend himself against ``slurs
and slanders.''
   MacDonald, 60, the flamboyant former aerospace engineer serving
his fourth four-year term as chairman, failed to get the council to
approve his chosen successor, Vice Chairman Johnny Thompson.
   The council then elected Marshall Plummer as temporary chairman.
Tribal lawyers were trying to determine today whether the council
acted within the law in bypassing Thompson.
   Geoffrey Standingbear, an attorney in the chairman's office, said
Thompson should become acting chairman automatically under the
tribal code.
   Council members gave the MacDonald a standing ovation as he left
the meeting Thursday night. Earlier, people could be heard cheering
outside the building when MacDonald agreed to take a leave.
   MacDonald has refused to answer a subpoena from the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs, which has denied him immunity from
prosecution, or to discuss the allegations with non-Indians.
   In a Navajo radio broadcast, MacDonald claimed the committee
targeted him for his advocacy of Indian rights. He also said the
committee is trying to undermine tribal sovereignty.
   ``We want to look back with pride with what we have done, and I
ask you to let me leave and that you allow me to have retain
effective legal representation. But I leave that to your wisdom,''
he said.
   MacDonald also asked to be treated fairly.
   ``In the end, we come to the same circle and love each other
because there is no way we can walk away from our clans,'' MacDonald
said.
   MacDonald and his running-mate Thompson won office in November
1986 by a plurality of about 750 votes of more than 60,000 cast.
MacDonald had been out of office for four years and served three
earlier terms. In 1977, a U.S. District Court jury failed to reach a
verdict against MacDonald on fraud and income tax evasion charges.
   An estimated 170,000 of the nation's 200,000 Navajos live on a
25,000-square-mile reservation that covers much of northeastern
Arizona and extends into northwestern New Mexico and southeastern
Utah.

<HEAD>Working Group Agrees On Means to Legalize Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa praised a
tentative accord that would legalize the banned trade union movement
if it reaches agreement with communist authorities on other
political and economic reforms.
   Government and Solidarity negotiators, in part of broad talks on
Poland's future, agreed in principle Thursday to amend the labor law
so Solidarity can be registered immediately if the two sides agree
on other reforms.
   ``That's a lot. That's a lot. That's great,'' said Walesa by
telephone from his home in Gdansk. Solidarity has demanded a return
to legal status after being banned in 1982.
   Later, Solidarity activist Henryk Wujec was allowed to appeal on
television for people to start Solidarity organizing committees ``so
there is a basis for legal existence of Solidarity later, because
now we know it will happen.''
   Officials announced the agreement after a session of a working
group devoted to trade unions. Negotiators decided the union could
be registered nationwide in one step under an amended labor law to
be passed by the parliament.
   A resolution passed by the working group also said the new
Solidarity would have freedom to create its own organizational
structures, but would have to negotiate jointly with other existing
unions during talks with management.
   Negotiators in a working group on youth problems said the
Independent Students Association also should be legalized. It was
the campus equivalent of Solidarity and was also banned in 1982.
   Government spokesmen have said since the talks began Feb. 6 that
legalization of Solidarity must be part of a ``package deal'' with
the opposition.
   Authorities also require agreement on a program of economic and
political reforms and on ``non-confrontational'' elections this
year, after which members of the opposition would assume a minority
role in parliament.
   Solidarity had wanted to be legalized under a new act and not be
bound by the 1982 labor law, which restricted how quickly a
nationwide union could form.
   ``We agree together that the procedure of registration will be
opened by a single legal act registering the nationwide trade union.
That is such as Solidarity demanded,'' said journalist Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, who led the opposition delegation to Thursday's
discussions.
   The government side has stressed it is not agreeing to make legal
again the old Solidarity, which it blames for causing social discord
in 1981 that led to its banning following a martial-law crackdown.
The government has said it will legalize a new union under the same
name that would function differently.
   The broad-based talks with Solidarity has received unprecedented
coverage in an official media in recent months.
   In another development, an official newspaper for the first time
published evidence that implicates the Soviet Union in the massacre
of thousands of Polish officers during World War II.
   The bodies of 4,000 Polish army officers deported to the Soviet
Union were uncovered by Hitler's army in spring 1943. Official
Soviet and Polish histories had maintained the Nazis killed the
officers in 1941, but many Poles and Western historians blame the
Soviets.
   A confidential June 1943 report by the Polish Red Cross that
appeared Wednesday in the weekly Odrodzenie (Rebirth) said:
``Judging by the papers found with the corpses, the murder took
place in the months of March and April 1940.''
   Because the site, 12 miles west of Smolensk in western Russia,
was at that time in possession of the Soviets, the report implied
Soviet responsibility for the crime.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim To Capture Town Near Southern Provincial Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudanese guerrillas today claimed
they captured a heavily defended southern town, killing or wounding
hundreds of government troops. Sudan said it had repelled a rebel
attack in the area.
   A Sudan People's Liberation Army leader, Lam Akol, refused to
list rebel casualties in the battle Tuesday in Liria, near the
southern provincial capital of Juba.
   Akol said ``about 75 percent'' of the 1,000 government troops
defending Liria were killed or wounded.
   On Wednesday, the Sudanese army command reported a rebel attack
on a military convoy on a highway heading northwest of town. The
army statement said the rebels killed five soldiers and injured 14,
but it claimed the army ``was able to inflict heavy losses on the
rebels, who were forced to flee.''
   There was no independent verification of the claims.
   Liria is about 45 miles southeast of Juba, which is a prime rebel
target. Between Liria and Juba is the government-held town of
Ngalangala and the White Nile river.
   ``We control 95 percent of southern Sudan. We are interested in
capturing the other 5 percent,'' Akol said.
   Rebels late last month captured the Upper Nile town of Nasir
after months of siege. Nasir is 500 miles south of Khartoum and 20
miles from the Ethiopian border.
   The rebel radio, believed to broadcast from Ethiopia's capital,
Addis Ababa, said the main rebel leader, John Garang, led the attack
on Nasir.
   Garang was a Sudanese army colonel before he organized the rebel
group in 1983. He launched the rebellion against the
Moslem-dominated Khartoum government to press for greater autonomy
and economic reforms in the largely Christian and animist southern
provinces of Bahr el-Ghazal, Upper Nile and Equatoria.
   In November, the rebels and the Democratic Unionist Party
negotiated a peace agreement that was later rejected by Prime
Minister Sadek Mahdi's government.
   The November agreement called on Mahdi to lift the state of
emergency, suspend application of Islamic law and convene a
constitutional conference by Dec. 31. The rebels agreed to a
ceasefire.
   At the time of the negotiations, the Democratic Unionist Party
was a coalition partner in Mahdi's government. However, the party
left the coalition after the government rejected the agreement.
   Mahdi then reorganized his Cabinet, giving greater power to the
National Islamic Front, which advocates Islamic law and opposes any
agreement with the rebels.
   The reported fall of Liria came while a three-man Democratic
Unionist Party delegation was meeting with rebel officials in Addis
Ababa.
   ``We were exploring the best ways of bringing about the
agreement,'' Akol said. ``Ways to mobilize the people to force the
Khartoum government to implement the agreement.''
   Akol said the two parties did not discuss recent calls for a
cease-fire by Mahdi and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.

<TEXT>
   A group of right-wing academics
who believe black majority rule is inevitable have proposed creating
an all-white, Afrikaner nation in a thinly populated section of
western South Africa.
   Carel Boshoff, leader of the Afrikaner Freedom Movement, outlined
details of the proposed nation Thursday that he said would include
the Atlantic coastline starting about 60 miles north of Cape Town
and extend 300 miles inland. The area contains no major cities, and
much of it is desert.
   Boshoff's as-yet-nameless nation also would include the southern
half of Namibia, but that South African-ruled territory is due to
gain independence by early next year.
   His proposal contrasts sharply with the demand of a nationwide
extremist group, the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, for creation of
a whites-only state consisting of Transvaal and the Orange Free
State, two of South Africa's four provinces. Both provinces have
vast farming areas and numerous gold mines, and Transvaal includes
the major cities of Pretoria and Johannesburg.
   Boshoff is a theologian and a former chairman of the Broederbond,
a secretive society of influential Afrikaners. He is the son-in-law
of the late Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd, who designed South
Africa's apartheid system in the 1950s.
   Boshoff's proposal represents a reversal of the ideology of
Verwoerd, who sought to relocate blacks in nominally independent
rural homelands while whites controlled the bulk of the country,
including the industrial centers, gold mines, ports and best
farmland.
   Boshoff contends establishment of a small, whites-only nation is
the only way of ensuring the survival of the Afrikaners, the mainly
Dutch-descended whites who make up about 60 percent of South
Africa's 5 million whites.
   In a controversial policy document last year, Boshoff said
Afrikaners should abandon hope of dominating the entire country,
where the 26 million blacks outnumber whites more than 5-to-1.
   ``Minority domination as currently practiced in South Africa is
morally unjustifiable,'' he wrote.
   The National Party government rejects the idea of a white
homeland. It is struggling to find support for its concept of racial
power-sharing, in which blacks would be brought into central
government but would not be allowed to overrule white interests.
   Boshoff said he envisioned a transitional period in which
Afrikaners would move to the proposed white nation while it remained
under South African control. He said infrastructure would be
improved with government grants similar to those extended to black
homelands.
   Boshoff acknowledged the area is dry, but suggested that the
region along the Orange River, which forms the South Africa-Namibia
border, could be developed for agriculture.
   ``A move to the area would change the lifestyle of people as they
know it now, but they have a choice of staying in the fat of South
Africa and melting away or move toward a new beginning,'' he said.

   Maynard Jackson, the first black man to serve as
mayor of Atlanta, has announced his candidacy for another term in
the office he left in 1981, although he concedes that victory could
be costly.
   ``We're about to take one big reduction in income,'' Jackson said
Thursday as he announced his candidacy with his wife, Valerie, from
the steps of City Hall.
   Jackson, a Democrat, has been working as a partner in a
Chicago-based law firm since he left office. Financially, he said,
running for mayor is ``the single most irrational move of my life.''
   Right now, Jackson's only opponent is Fulton County Commissioner
Michael Lomax, who has said he wouldn't keep all of the $100,000
salary approved by the Atlanta City Council earlier this month.
Mayor Andrew Young currently earns $65,000 per year.
   Young was elected mayor in 1981 when Jackson was barred by the
city charter from seeking a third consecutive term. Young is
required to leave office under the same charter provision.
   Jackson was first elected mayor in October 1973, defeating
incumbent Sam Massell with 60 percent of the vote.
   In a brief campaign speech, Jackson said he committed himself to
public service in 1968 because he wanted a ``more prosperous Atlanta
for all Atlantans.'' He identified the issues of his latest campaign
as drugs, crime and assistance for elderly citizens.
   ``I have listened carefully over the years ... and people are
asking for help,'' Jackson said. ``That's why I'm running for mayor
of Atlanta. I promise you help is on the way.''

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani has
joined a prominent law firm but kept open a possible mayoral
candidacy, saying he is carefully considering running and is
encouraged by the support he has found.
   In joining the Manhattan-based law firm of White &amp; Case, Giuliani
said Thursday, ``I told them, assume I'm running for mayor and let's
structure the relationship out of that, so there'd be no
misunderstanding.''
   Still, he insisted at a luncheon with reporters that he was
undecided about entering the race and viewed it as his
responsibility to move with care. He said he was holding discussions
to gauge if he had sufficient support.
   ``I'm continuing to explore the possibility of running for
mayor,'' he said, adding that it was prudence, not indecision, that
has led to his long courtship with the prospect.
   Giuliani, a Republican, would face Ronald S. Lauder, former
ambassador to Austria and heir to the Lauder cosmetics fortune, in
his party's primary.
   If he ran, Giuliani said, he would accept the city's voluntary
spending limit of $3 million each for the primary and general
election. Lauder has said he would not accept that limit and the
public financing that comes with it.
   Giuliani would have the power of his public profile as a
successful prosecutor to counter Lauder's cash advantage. The winner
would face the Democratic nominee in this heavily Democratic city,
where a Republican has not won for mayor since John Lindsay in 1965.

   Pan Am Flight 103 was downed over
Scotland by a bomb concealed within a radio-cassette player that
investigators believe was placed aboard the plane in West Germany, a
British detective said.
   Investigators believe the explosive that shattered the Boeing 747
on Dec. 21 was put aboard the aircraft in Frankfurt, where the
flight began, Chief Superintendant John Orr said Thursday. It
apparently had been placed in the hold of aircraft as checked
baggage.
   ``New positive lines of inquiry are unfolding,'' he told a news
conference in this southwestern Scottish town where the jumbo jet
crashed, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
   ``While there is insufficient evidence at this stage to establish
the identity of the person or group responsible for this dreadful
crime, the progress made and the evidence obtained has been
substantial,'' said Orr, an investigator from Strathclyde police, a
Scottish regional police force.
   Asked whether the investigation would point to a specific
country, Orr said: ``It may.''
   On Feb. 8, the Jerusalem Post reported the bomb that destroyed
the jet was hidden in a radio-cassette recorder and was traced to
Frankfurt.
   That report quoted unidentified investigators as saying the
device was similar, but not identical, to one found earlier in the
possession of members of Ahmed Jibril's extremist Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. The group has denied
involvement.
   Orr said the brand name of the radio-cassette player had not been
established and would not say whether it was a pocket-sized device
or a larger model. Nor did he say whether investigators had located
the detonator.
   Anti-terrorist experts have said the explosive most likely used
was Semtex, an odorless, highly malleable substance made in
Czechoslovakia and known to be used by terrorist organizations.
   Orr said he was ``aware of some aspects of the explosive that was
used'' but declined to elaborate.
   The discovery of the bomb's hiding place followed painstaking
reconstruction of a baggage container from pieces _ some no larger
than a table knife _ strewn over 40 miles of Scottish countryside.
   ``The reconstruction of the baggage container suggests that the
explosive device may have been among the baggage from the Frankfurt
flight,'' Orr said.
   ``The particular bag which contained the device has not been
identified at this stage, but there is the most detailed work under
way with forensic assistance to achieve this identification. I
believe this can be done,'' he said.
   Orr said the belief that Frankfurt was the origin of the bomb was
based on ``a balance of probabilities.'' Most of the 1,500 pounds of
baggage in the container in which the bomb was located was checked
in at Frankfurt, and the rest was ``interline'' baggage from other
points.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt on a Boeing 727. At London's
Heathrow Airport, the New York-bound flight was changed to a Boeing
747.
   A spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor's office, which is
coordinating the West German investigation into the crash, said of
Orr's statement on the Frankfurt connection: ``We have no knowledge
about that.''
   The most persistent claim of responsibility has come from an
anonymous caller who has repeatedly told international news agencies
it was the work of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, an
Iranian group.
   CBS News reported this month that Jibril was the principal
architect of the bombing. Last month, the Hamburg newspaper Bild
reported Jibril's organization was involved.
   In Montreal, the 33-member council of the International Civil
Aviation Organization is meeting to discuss ways to better airline
security in the wake of the bombing.
   A draft resolution co-sponsored by Britain and the United States
calls for improving technology of bomb-detection devices so they can
detect plastic explosives.
   The resolution questions whether computers, radios and other
electronic devices should be allowed aboard aircraft since X-ray
scanners cannot distinguish between concealed explosives and
components of the devices.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German government today
expressed deep consternation over Iran's death threats against
author Salman Rushdie and ordered its top diplomat back to Bonn.
   In Cologne, the owner of the German-language rights to ``The
Satanic Verses'' said today it would not publish the controversial
book out of concern for the safety of the company's employees.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog said the Iranian
ambassador to West Germany, Mehdi Ahary Mostafavi, was summoned to
the Foreign Ministry today and warned that the death threat poses
``an encumbrance for German-Iranian relations.''
   West Germany is Iran's biggest trading partner and has more than
100 businesses with representatives in the Islamic republic.
   The Bonn government's warning was delivered to the Iranian envoy
by foreign affairs secretary Juergen Sudhoff at the instruction of
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Chrobog told reporters at a
press conference.
   ``The deep consternation of the federal government over the death
threat against Salman Rushdie was conveyed,'' Chrobog said.
   Genscher has also ordered the charge d'affairs in Tehran to
return to Bonn, the Foreign Ministry reported.
   Foreign Ministers of the European Community plan to meet in
Brussels on Monday to discuss the execution order issued by
Ayatollah Khomeini against the Indian-born British author of ``The
Satanic Verses.''
   The book has set off a furor in the much of the Moslem world, and
Iran has offered a bounty of up to $5.2 million for the murder of
Rushdie.
   Many Moslems claim that the book's portrayal of the prophet
Mohammed, founder of the Islamic faith, as a philandering
businessman is blasphemous.
   In a statement distributed to the news media, the prestigious
Kiepenheuer und Witsch publishing company today explained its
reasons for refusing to publish the book.
   ``We have decided not to publish the novel `The Satanic Verses,'
in order to not endanger the life and limb of the employees in the
current situation,'' the statement said.
   The publishing firm owns the German-language rights to the book,
and the decision means that Rushdie's work will not be available to
readers in West Germany, Switzerland and Austria in their own
language.

   A man accused of stabbing a teen-ager to
death and taking another captive on a cross-country flight from
justice was returned to New Jersey today to face prosecution.
   Michael Ardila, 19, was scheduled to be arraigned on murder and
kidnapping charges in the death of Anthony Pompelio, 17, of Sparta,
who was killed Sunday after he tried to break up an argument between
Ardila and Donna Shaban, 17.
   Police said Ardila then abducted Shaban, also of Sparta, and fled
in a stolen car.
   Shaban was found Tuesday near Groom, Texas, and told police
Ardila had pushed her from the car as they drove along the highway.
   Ardila was captured Tuesday near Santa Rosa, N.M. Authorities
said he crashed through a police roadblock and overturned his
vehicle amid a hail of gunfire from sheriff's deputies.
   On Thursday, Pompelio was eulogized as a hero for trying to
defend Shaban.
   ``He was a faithful young man who died defending another,'' said
Monsignor Francis J. Bischoff. ``He would never hurt anyone. He was
just in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
   About 500 classmates and family members gathered for Pompelio's
funeral at St. Michael's Church in Netcong. The students were
excused from classes at Sparta High School and Pompelio's wrestling
teammates served as pall bearers.
   Shaban returned to New Jersey early Wednesday accompanied by her
mother.

   A homeless man who read erudite publications by
street lights and reportedly never asked for handouts was found dead
on an Upper East Side street, carrying $2,000 in his pocket.
   ``We all figured he wasn't broke, he was just a broken man,''
said Donald DaVanzo, an electrician at a construction site near
where Richard DeMattia, 46, was found dead early Thursday.
   DeMattia had lived on East 66th Street in Manhattan for at least
a year, storing his belongings inside a church, while his mother,
Lucille DeMattia, who lives about 10 miles away in Queens, tried
desperately to find him.
   Mrs. DeMattia told a local newspaper she had hired a private
detective at one point to try to track down her son, whom she said
was a veteran receiving disability payments.
   She said she did not know he had been homeless until late
Thursday, when police traced her through an identification card her
son was carrying.
   When asked how she and her son, whom she hadn't seen since 1986,
became estranged, she said, ``It's a long story.''
   DeMattia had a bank account with $638 dollars in it at the time
of his death, which apparently was due to natural causes, said
Manhattan Chief of Detectives Aaron Rosenthal.
   ``He also had $2,000 cash on his person,'' Rosenthal said, adding
that his source of income was unclear.
   He was known to area residents and merchants as ``Charlie'' and
``Philip,'' and stayed mostly on East 66th Street between York and
First avenues.
   ``He was a peaceful man. No one ever felt threatened by him,''
said Connie Adamec, a resident of the block.
   The Rev. Robert Tomlian, pastor of the St. John Nepomucene Roman
Catholic Church, said DeMattia kept his belongings near a
confessional and spent much of his time during the day inside the
church. Only on extremely cold nights would he sleep in the church
basement.
   Ms. Adamec said that she and other neighbors tried repeatedly to
get Damattia to go to a homeless shelter, but he always said he
preferred life on the street.
   Tabassam Qureshi, who owns two newsstands on First Avenue near
66th Street, said DeMattia was a regular customer who bought The
Christian Science Monitor and The Wall Street Journal.
   ``I don't know, maybe he had a share in something,'' Qureshi said.
   DaVanzo said he sometimes saw DeMattia, who said he was an
electronics engineer, read The Nation or Scientific American as he
lay beneath his quilts.
   ``His shoes were always shined,'' he said. ``I guess there was
something in his life he couldn't deal with _ and it broke him.''

   Harvard University President Derek Bok is
set to name corporate law professor Robert C. Clark to be the next
dean of Harvard Law School, the Harvard Crimson reported today.
   A professor at the university since 1978, Clark would succeed
James Vorenberg, 49, who last year announced his intention to step
down.
   Citing unidentified professors, the student newspaper said Clark
was among three or four candidates referred by a six-member faculty
committee to Bok to be the next dean.
   One professor said the appointment was scheduled to be announced
next Wednesday, ``but it will probably be speeded up'' now that the
information is out.
   Clark was originally a member of the faculty committee but
reportedly stepped down last winter when he learned he was a
candidate for the post.
   Clark, 44, has a bachelor's degree from the Maryknoll Seminary, a
doctorate from Columbia and a law degree from Harvard, the Crimson
reported.
   He was an associate with the Ropes and Gray law firm in Boston
from 1972 to 1974 before becoming a professor at Yale Law School. He
accepted a post at Harvard in 1978.

<TEXT>
   The leader of the smallest faction
fighting Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia today said he dismissed
his guerrilla commander and other senior officers for lack of
discipline and disloyalty.
   The leader of the smallest rebel faction, Son Sann, said he was
taking over the military command of his Khmer People's National
Liberation Front. It was the latest in a series of internal disputes
that have seriously weakened his force in recent years.
   He made the announcement to reporters covering the preparations
for the second round of talks aimed at settling the war between
Cambodian guerrillas and Vietnamese troops who invaded Cambodia 10
years ago.
   He said he dismissed Gen. Sak Sutsakhan, the chief of the general
staff and other officers after field commanders accused them of
lacking loyalty and discipline.
   In Hanoi, the official Vietnam News Agency quoted a Foreign
Ministry spokesman as saying Vietnam will ``do its utmost'' to make
the Jakarta talks a success.
   But it quoted the unidentified spokesman as saying Thursday that
the guerrillas demanded the dissolution of the pro-Vietnamese
government in Cambodia ``in disregard of the realities.''
   The guerrillas ``have no foothold'' in Cambodia and ``are losing
support from the outside,'' the Vietnamese spokesman claimed,
according to the dispatch.
   Conflicts already had surfaced in Thursday's preparatory
discussions in Jakarta for weekend talks that include Vietnam and
the government it installed in Cambodia.
   The full talks to begin Sunday will bring together the leaders or
foreign ministers of Vietnam, Laos, the four warring Cambodian
factions, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations _
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and the Philippines.
   All parties involved say they agree that a future Cambodia should
be independent and neutral. All endorse a government consisting of
the four Cambodian factions and led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a
resistance leader.
   They disagree over who would supervise a general election.
   Son Sann refused today to say how many troops his faction had,
but Western diplomats in Thailand put the figure at 13,000.
   The group has been torn by internal power struggles and a
weakened military position since a 1984-85 Vietnamese offensive
wiped out all its major bases along the Thai-Cambodian border.
   Son Sann's group and that of Sihanouk, with an estimated 19,000
fighters, are allied in the resistance coalition with the communist
Khmer Rouge, which has 30,000-40,000 fighters. Some 60,000-70,000
Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and ended a Khmer Rouge
regime under which about 2 million of Cambodia's 8 million people
died from executions, famine and civil unrest.
   Many nations are concerned the Khmer Rouge may try to reseize
power.
   Hanoi has promised to pull out by 1990, or by September if a
political solution is reached.

   The Education Department's civil rights office
strayed far from its mission of fighting racial discrimination
during the Reagan administration, say Democratic investigators for a
House committee.
   A report by the majority staff of the House Education and Labor
Committee adds that the prospects for revived enforcement under the
Bush administration are not yet clear.
   ``Whether the OCR (Office of Civil Rights) accepts its
responsibility and begins to execute the laws as originally intended
will depend greatly upon the commitment of the incoming
administration to civil rights enforcement,'' it said.
   The authors said they hoped the Bush administration would
undertake a comprehensive review of the issues they raise in the
report.
   Under Reagan, they conclude, OCR was ``stymied by an
administration which actively opposed the laws which were entrusted
to it and took efforts to minimize the agency's potential impact.''
   The current director of the agency, LeGree Daniels, is a holdover
from the Reagan administration and it is not known whether she will
stay on. In a letter published with the report, Daniels denounced it
as ``replete with inaccuracies and misconceptions of OCR's role.''
   OCR is in charge of enforcing statutes barring discrimination on
the basis of race, gender, handicap, age and national origin in all
federally funded education activities and programs.
   Democratic committee aides visited six of the 10 OCR regional
offices between January and March 1988. They reported finding
widespread mismanagement, a decimated staff and confusion stemming
from lack of policy direction from the top. Specifically, they noted
the following:
   _OCR initiated 9,768 complaint investigations between fiscal 1981
and 1988, most of them related to handicap discrimination. Only 15
percent involved racial discrimination _ ``a violation of its
mandate'' since the office was created in connection with the 1964
Civil Rights Act.
   ``There was a clear perception among the regional office staff
that certain issues were `off limits' and could not be investigated.
Most of the issues involved race discrimination,'' the report said.
   The report noted these developments:
   _The number of full-time equivalent employees at OCR has dropped
from 1,099 in fiscal 1981 to 820 in fiscal 1988. Reagan
administration budget requests for the agency declined from $51
million in 1982 to $41 million in 1989.
   _The Supreme Court's Grove City decision, since reversed by
Congress, prompted OCR to close in whole or in part 674 complaint
investigations and 88 compliance reviews. The decision said only
specific activities or programs receiving federal money were subject
to federal penalties for discrimination. The problem was aggravated
because the Education Department had no reliable way to trace money
it had given to institutions or school districts.
   _The administration forced OCR to process state higher education
desegregation cases under court oversight in 105 days rather than
the 195 days recommended by the federal court. Cases were withdrawn
or narrowed to accomplish this.
   _Regional staff trying to cite schools for civil rights
violations often were stymied by headquarters. Of 112 draft
``letters of finding'' of violations submitted from January 1987 to
June 1988, only seven were approved while 92 were resolved with a
``violation corrected.''
   _In many cases the ``violation corrected'' designation meant only
that corrective action had been promised. Little follow-up
monitoring was done to assure actual compliance by school districts
and universities.
   The committee staff said formerly segregated higher education
systems ``must not be evaluated by a `good faith'' standard, but
must be held responsible for totally eliminating the vestiges of
discrimination, `root and branch.'''
   It recommended that OCR conduct more broad compliance reviews of
systemic discrimination issues, particularly regarding race. And it
urged the agency to submit expanded staff, computer and equipment
needs to Congress in time for fiscal 1990 budget consideration.
   In her rebuttal, Daniels accused the committee staff of
misrepresenting her agency's investigative and enforcement
procedures, distorting statistical evidence and drawing
unsubstantiated conclusions. She said OCR's emphasis on
negotiations, as opposed to enforcement actions, has proven
effective and averted the need for protracte proceedings in many
cases.

   Can a middle-aged British housewife find
happiness by fleeing her unresponsive husband, two self-centered,
grown children and a dreary working-class existence in Liverpool?
   That's the question ``Shirley Valentine'' attempts to answer in a
surprisingly laugh-filled, two-hour monologue about the ``unused
life'' of a woman who admits she has ``nowhere to go.''
   The play by Willy Russell, which opened Thursday at Broadway's
Booth Theater, is a deceptive little comedy. Its sweetness and fun
are readily apparent, primarily in the persona of its radiant star,
Pauline Collins. But underneath the smiles lie a sadness and ache
that give the play a special resonance.
   ``Why do we have all these feelings if we don't use them?''
Shirley asks. She doesn't get much opportunity, particularly with
her lout of a husband who doesn't harass her as much as he ignores
her.
   ``He likes everything the way it has been,'' says Shirley about
this man who wants his tea on the table at the same time every
night. And she complies, even frying up an order of eggs and chips
in front of the audience. For much of her life, Shirley has just
accepted things as they are, particularly her relationships with her
husband and children.
   ``Marriage is like the Middle East,'' she philosophizes.
``There's no solution.''
   Her good friend, Jane, offers her one, or at least an escape.
It's a round-trip ticket to Greece _ without her husband. Act 1
finds Shirley debating whether she should go. Act 2 has her sitting
on a Greek island and gazing at the Mediterranean.
   In between, there are stories, homey ancedotes told with good
humor and grace. She reminisces about her days in school when she
hated everything, including herself, and about her reunion with an
old school chum who has become a high-priced hooker. There are
stories about her family, particularly her son who once played
Joseph in a Christmas pageant and improvised his way into a room at
the inn. There are also stories about her affair with a Greek tavern
owner, the man who finally makes her see her own worth.
   A lot of these ancedotes are funny, and director Simon Callow
lets the laughs build nicely. But the evening's chief pleasure
consists of watching the ingratiating Miss Collins develop her
character. The actress, best known to American audiences as the
saucy maid Sarah on public television's ``Upstairs, Downstairs,''
doesn't just tell jokes; she uses them to build Shirley into a
credible human being who makes her sorrows as well as her silly
behavior matter.
   British playwrights seem to be dealing lately with the unraveling
of the female mind, manner and mores. Alan Ayckbourn plowed similiar
territory in his ``Woman in Mind,'' seen last season off-Broadway
with Stockard Channing playing a hallucinating wife and mother. Alan
Bennett did a similar turn recently on television's ``Masterpiece
Theater.'' His ``Talking Heads: Bed Among the Lentils'' was a
bitter, biting and achingly hilarious account of a provincial
vicar's alcoholic wife, brilliantly played by Maggie Smith.
   ``Shirley Valentine'' isn't of that caliber. Shirley simply is
not as complex a human being as Ayckbourn's addled heroine or
examined so unmercilessly as Bennett's forlorn subject. But because
of Miss Collins, Shirley's tale of dreams deferred, of a life not
acted upon until it is almost too late, arouses a lot of laughs,
some sympathy and even a little regret. She makes you care for this
woman who can't remember when her marriage stopped being good.
   In other reviews:
   Howard Kissel of the Daily News calls ``Shirley Valentine'': ``a
one-person show that is actually a play ... a joyful, captivating
piece of theater.''
   In The New York Times, Frank Rich said, ``Audiences will adore
Pauline Collins ... because she radiates the genuine, unpretentious
vitality of a warm old friend giving us the real lowdown.''
   However, he added, ``That Miss Collins captivates us with her
honesty is all the more amazing given how frequently her vehicle
seems contrived.''
   In the New York Post, Clive Barnes wrote that, ``The play is more
fantasy than realism ... and always Shirley is a shade too cute to
be true. Yet Russell has a way with a phrase. ...
   ``This is among the most entertaining evenings in town _ and both
funny and touching as an added bonus.''

   The seizure of a Roman Catholic church
by dissident Polish parishioners reflects a growing cultural clash
between the U.S. church and a new wave of Polish immigrants, a
Catholic official says.
   About 100 parishioners began occupying St. Michael the Archangel
Church on Saturday because they want the Rev. Roman Palaszewski to
remain. The priest, part of an exchange program begun with Polish
church authorities, has been ordered to return to Poland.
   The protesting parishioners claim their new pastor, the Rev. John
Bambol, engineered Palaszewski's ouster because the latter was too
active in the Polish community.
   They said Palaszewski, who has been in seclusion since his
removal, brought enthusiasm to the church, knitted together the old
and young parishioners, packed the Polish-language Masses and
started a Polish-language class for their children.
   The drama in Bridgeport has played out at other Polish parishes
in recent years.
   In August 1987, 1,000 parishioners at a church in New Britain
took to the streets to protest the transfer of one of their priests.
A month later, Polish immigrants in Portland, Maine, picketed
outside their church demanding a Mass in their native language.
   One top church official attributed these and many less strident
flare-ups across the country to attitudes brought to the United
States by Poles weaned on a more politicized church and the
Solidarity movement.
   ``It's two different world views,'' said the Rev. Peter W.
Zendzian, who directs the office for pastoral care of immigrants and
refugees for the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops in Washington.
   ``You have a lot of people who were Solidarity members and they
were able ... to mobilize quickly and make their feelings known,''
he said Thursday. ``We're more used to getting a committee and
studying things. Our processes usually take a little bit longer.''
   The parishioners in Bridgeport are vowing to occupy the ornate,
89-year-old brick church in a largely Hispanic neighborhood until
Bishop Edward Egan, who heads the Bridgeport diocese, agrees to meet
with them.
   They have maintained their vigil in shifts, their numbers
swelling each evening to as many as 200.
   Most sit quietly in the candle-lit sanctuary, singing hymns and
chanting prayers in Polish.
   Some drift to the back of the church, kneeling before an icon of
the Black Madonna of Czestochowa, who is revered by Polish
Catholics. Nearby is another icon of the Rev. Maximilian Kolbe, the
Polish priest martyred in a Nazi concentration camp.
   Frustrated by the bishop's refusal to meet with them, two of the
dissidents began a hunger strike Wednesday night. They vowed to
remain locked in a confessional until their demands were met.
   A three-hour meeting Thursday night between members of the group
and diocesan officials failed to settle the dispute.
   Palaszewski's five-year contract was terminated in December by
joint agreement between Franciscan officials in the United States
and Krakow, Poland, according to church officials.
   The priest was removed in December without explanation. Diocesan
leaders, who have said Palaszewski has the right to appeal his
transfer, didn't comment on the dispute after Thursday's meeting.
   The dissidents, many wearing Solidarity buttons and ribbons with
the red-and-white colors of the Polish flag, have made no attempt to
disrupt the daily Masses that continue to be celebrated in both
English and Polish.
   The group includes a number of former Solidarity members who came
to this country within the last five years, including Richard
Debski, one of the hunger strikers.
   ``This situation is not only for our church, it is everywhere
there are Polish people,'' said Debski, who was jailed for about
five months as a leader of Solidarity in the Polish city of Wroclaw.
   Ironically, the event that precipitated the rebellion reflects
efforts by the American Roman Catholic church to accommodate the
needs of Polish immigrants, who say they feel closer to Polish
priests than to American priests.
   About 70,000 Poles have emigrated to the United States since
1977, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The
number of immigrants peaked in 1984 and 1985, when about 9,400 came
to America in each year.
   Zendzian said the church set up the exchange program about a year
ago with church authorities in Poland to bring Polish priests to
America.
   Palaszewski, the priest at the center of the St. Michael's
dispute, was brought to America under a similar program operated by
the Franciscan order, which is responsible for assigning priests to
St. Michael's.

<HEAD>Toshiba Says It Supplied Equipment For Suspect Libyan Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Toshiba Corp. provided electrical equipment
for a Libyan factory that the U.S. government suspects of producing
shells for chemical weapons, a Toshiba official said today.
   But the official said Toshiba thought the factory was a
desalination plant, and acted only as subcontractor for Japan Steel
Works, a frequent Toshiba customer.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Japan
Steel Works ordered power transformers and switching equipment for
the plant from Toshiba in June 1985, and Toshiba delivered the
equipment to the company in Japan in December of the same year.
   The equipment is a key component of electrical power systems in
virtually all factories, he said.
   ``We had heard that the equipment would be taken to Libya, but
understood that it would be used in a desalination project,'' the
official said.
   But he said such equipment is normally examined by company
employees after it is installed, and said Toshiba was ``still
examining'' what happened when Toshiba employees checked the suspect
plant. The results of that examination should be known next week, he
said.
   The Japanese government determined in spring 1987 that a Toshiba
subsidiary, Toshiba Machine Co., violated international trade rules
by selling sophisticated milling machines to the Soviet Union that
were capable of manufacturing quieter propellors for Soviet
submarines. Toshiba said then that it was unaware of its
subsidiary's activities.
   Japan Steel Works has denied it helped construct a chemical
weapons plant or provided any weapons-making products to Libya, and
said it only exported desalinization equipment and maintenance
machinery for the suspect factory in Rabta, a desert area near
Tripoli.
   Officials from Japan's trade and foreign ministries also have
denied any Japanese involvement in production of a chemical weapons
plant in Libya.

<HEAD>Two More Sea Lions Captured</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Biologists spent almost a day in a driving rain,
watching sea lions circle a floating cage before two ventured inside
and were caught for what is intended to be a permanent return to the
Pacific Ocean.
   Both are being taken today to the Long Beach Peninsula, just
north of the mouth of the Columbia River, where one nicknamed ``Blue
Eye'' was released Thursday, said Bob Byrne of the state Wildlife
Department.
   ``He scurried off into the water and headed out to sea,'' Byrne
said.
   A second sea lion that, like Blue Eye, was captured Wednesday in
``Operation Goodbye'' died in captivity later that night while
coming out of anesthesia, Byrne said.
   A fish ladder at the locks, the sole passage for salmon and
steelhead to reach Lake Washington and upstream spawning grounds,
has become a favorite feeding spot for about 20 sea lions, which
migrate through the area from southern California and Mexico.
   The relocation program is the sixth effort in five years of
attempts to stop the predation, which has endangered an already
fragile steelhead run.
   The dead sea lion, found to have a .22-caliber bullet wound in
the neck and a severe infestation of lung worms, was anesthetized so
scientists could attach a radio transmitter to monitor the 550-pound
creature's movements.
   ``Using anesthesia on the animal was one of the risks that went
along with studying them,'' said Bob DeLong, a marine mammal
biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   DeLong said ``Sickie,'' as the creature was dubbed, probably was
shot near the locks, possibly by someone frustrated by the failure
of previous efforts to chase the sea lions away.
   ``I'm afraid we're going to see more and more shootings,'' he
said.
   The bullet wound and lung infestation however ``may have
compromised his ability ... to withstand the anesthesia,'' DeLong
said.
   Ben Deeble of Greenpeace, which has monitored efforts to rid the
locks of the sea lions and given tentative approval, questioned
whether it was necessary to anesthetize the animals.
   He also said he would prefer relocating the animals and marking
them with paint rather than attaching radio transmitters to monitor
their movements.

<HEAD>Union Files Lawsuit Over Worsening Conditions For Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police say the growing number of drug-related
arrests in the city has led to longer waits in booking and
arraigning suspects, with some officers complaining of spending more
than 30 hours processing offenders.
   ``I'm not going to say it's the worst it's ever been, but there
is a backlog everywhere in the system,'' Inspector John P. Walsh,
commander of the Police Department's Criminal Justice Bureau,
conceded Thursday. ``It's simply a volume problem.''
   Although the officers are paid overtime for their waiting, the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association has filed a lawsuit against the
Police Department, claiming that conditions are ``dangerous,
unsanitary and overcrowded'' for officers forced to wait for hours
in Manhattan's Criminal Courts Building, Queens Central Booking and
Brooklyn Central Booking at the Men's House of Detention.
   The lawsuit was filed last month in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan. A hearing is scheduled next week.
   ``Sure we like the overtime, but to be dehumanized like this,
it's like blood money,'' said one officer who said he had been
waiting 30 hours.
   ``The criminals we bring in get three meals a day and a place to
sleep,'' said another.
   One detective who had arrested a pickpocket in Queens and spent
39 hours waiting for the arrest to be processed said, ``If I had it
to do again I'd let the guy walk away.''
   The officers all declined to give their names.
   Walsh blamed the problem on a significant increase in arrests in
the past year, largely because of drug-related crimes. Citywide
arrests increased 30.4 percent last month over January 1988, from
18,671 to 24,352.
   He said the additional arrests meant that the District Attorney's
office in each borough had more cases and that officers had to wait
longer for interviews with prosecutors in areas with limited space.
   Phil Caruso, head of the police union, said conditions had become
intolerable over the past year and the lawsuit was a last resort.

   A man shot and slightly wounded
an ex-soldier and a bystander today on a Northern Ireland street,
police said.
   The former soldier, a Protestant who served part-time in the
locally recruited Ulster Defense Regiment until three years ago, was
hit in the arm, police said. A woman was hit with a stray bullet in
the leg, they said.
   The incident happened on the main street of Ballynahinch, 20
miles south of Belfast. There was no immediate claim of
responsibility.
   The gunman escaped in a car that had been hijacked outside a
house in Catholic west Belfast, a stronghold of Irish Republican
Army support, police said. The occupants of the house were held
hostage overnight and then freed.
   On Thursday, gunmen burst into a Protestant barroom in Belfast
and shot and wounded five customers, one of them critically, police
said. The Irish National Liberation Army, an IRA offshoot, claimed
responsibility, saying it was avenging the killing of Catholics in
recent days by Protestant extremists.
   These victims included an attorney specializing in defending IRA
suspects, a town councilor representing the IRA's political wing,
Sinn Fein, and a Belfast glazier with no known political connections.
   The IRA and Irish National Liberation Army are fighting to rid
Northern Ireland of British rule and unite the province and its
Protestant majority with the mainly Catholic Irish Republic. The
Protestant assailants come from shadowy illegal groups committed to
keeping Northern Ireland British.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force,
issued a statement denouncing the latest ``vicious cycle of violence
and counter violence.''
   It called Catholic and Protestant gunmen ``an evil scourge of
Northern Ireland'' and appealed to the public to reject them and
support the security forces. ``Experience has shown that violence
only begets more violence and produces more grief and misery for
all,'' it said.

<HEAD>Government Said Agents Got Test Bomb Through Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents carried a test bomb, hand grenade
and gun through American Airlines security at Logan International
Airport in 1987, the government charges in a lawsuit against the
airline.
   The lawsuit alleging 25 violations of federal regulations was
filed Thursday by Jeremiah O'Sullivan, the acting U.S. attorney for
Massachusetts.
   Al Becker, a spokesman for American Airlines at its corporate
headquarters in Dallas, said it would be inappropriate for him to
comment on the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit said that on June 22, 1987, a Federal Aviation
Administration inpsector went through the airline's X-ray system at
the airport ``with a test pipe bomb and a hand grenade in his
carry-on luggage.''
   Another agent had a gun in an attache case, the lawsuit said, and
``the screener, who was not paying attention to the screen while the
encapsulated weapon passed through the X-ray system, failed to
detect the weapon.''
   Test weapons are made of materials similar to real weapons and
should look the same on X-ray machines, the U.S. attorney's office
said.
   On the same day the agents made the tests, a federal agent saw 22
passengers go through American Airlines security ``without the
employee looking through the monitor,'' the lawsuit said.
   It also said only one employee was working the security gate that
day. Airlines are required to have both a monitor for X-ray machines
and a supervisor on duty at all times.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Robbins, who is handling the
case, said that under FAA procedures, airlines are notified of
security violations shortly after they are detected, and ``some are
filed (as civil complaints), and some are not.''
   The lawsuit seeks the maximum $1,000 fine for each of the 25
alleged security violations.
   Last December, a bomb planted on a Pan American jet exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the
ground.
   ``Passengers have a right to expect that the airlines to which
they are paying large amounts of money are taking their security
obligation seriously and are paying attention to what they are
doing,'' O'Sullivan said.
   Becker said American Airlines has ``very elaborate, very
rigorous'' security at every airport it serves, he said, but
acknowledged, ``I know nothing about our system at Logan in
particular.''
   Workers at the American Airlines desk at Logan declined to
comment.
   Becker said the airline has been fined for security lapses in the
past and that most airlines have some documented security violations.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has proposed
talks with elected Palestinians on forming a ``political entity,''
and offered to hold elections in the occupied lands.
   Rabin, speaking Thursday on Israel's Arabic television, promised
he would bring his proposal to a Cabinet vote if Palestinians in the
territories accepted it, even with reservations. He said army troops
might be withdrawn from the occupied lands on voting days.
   ``We recognize in you a possibility of a political entity,''
Rabin told Palestinians. ``Let us be partners for peace.''
   Rabin did not elaborate on what he meant by a ``political
entity,'' but his wording seemed to suggest he was expanding on the
idea of limited Palestinian self-rule or autonomy once offered by
Israel.
   In the occupied territories Thursday, Israeli soldiers shot and
killed a 25-year-old Palestinian, Issam El Bulbul, during a
stone-throwing clash in the occupied West Bank town of Nablus, Arab
doctors said. Eight Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the West
Bank and occupied Gaza Strip.
   The army said El Bulbul ``intended to throw a large brick at a
soldier'' when he was shot.
   Nablus residents staged a one-day general strike today to protest
his death, which brought to 381 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 14-month rebellion against Israeli rule. Fifteen Israelis have
also been killed.
   In clashes today, two Palestinians were wounded in the West Bank,
Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed one casualty.
   On Thursday, Israeli legislators, including one from the
center-left Labor Party, caused new tensions in Israel's coalition
government when they met with a prominent Palestinian activist.
   Aides to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud
bloc said the recent dialogue between some Israelis and Palestinians
linked to the PLO could reignite violence in the occupied lands and
only strengthened the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Labor leader Shimon Peres expressed support for the meetings of
his party members with Palestinians and indicated he would join at a
later stage despite the opposition of party hawks.
   ``I support meetings with the representatives of Palestinians
from the territories who are not involved in terrorism,'' Peres said
on Israel Army radio. ``When I have time I'll meet them too.''
   Two widely publicized meetings took place earlier this week in
Jerusalem involving three prominent pro-PLO figures and leading
Labor members.
   On Thursday, Amnon Rubinstein, head of the centrist Shinui party
and Labor legislator Avraham Burg met Faisal Husseini, the head of
Jerusalem's Arab Studies Center who is closely identified with the
PLO.
   But a growing uproar over the meeting prompted two reserve army
generals, Shlomo Gazit and Aharon Yariv, to back out.
   Husseini, 48, who has been held in detention during most of the
uprising, said he joined in the talks to explain the PLO's positions
to the Israelis.
   ``It's time to go and talk to these people, and let them see the
monster face to face, and see he is not a monster,'' Husseini said.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Tax Pros Get Wrong Answers, Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty professional tax-return preparers came up
with 50 different answers when asked to calculate the federal taxes
of a hypothetical family, Money magazine reported today.
   The professionals' answers ranged from $12,359 to $35,813 _ an
even worse performance than a year ago.
   The accountant who designed the test said the correct tax was
$23,393, but the law is so confusing that several correct answers
were possible, Money said. Ten of the 50 preparers made no major
mistakes but computed the family's taxes as high as $24,493.
   ``The abundance of mistakes our test turned up suggests that pros
are nowhere near as knowledgeable about the tax law as they are
supposed to be,'' Money said in its March issue. ``After all, we
were samplying highly regarded preparers who willingly accepted our
challenge to calculate the model return.''
   The survey suggests that it is not only Internal Revenue Service
employees who are not fully up to speed on provisions of the
landmark 1986 tax overhaul. A General Accounting Office survey
released last week found that IRS personnel whose job is to answer
taxpayers' telephoned queries gave the correct answers to only 64
percent of selected test questions that were posed during the last
filing season.
   The hypothetical family in the magazine survey was one with
problems that, while possible among those with high incomes, are
unlikely to be encountered by the typical taxpayer.
   The family had salaries of $56,400 but both spouses took lump-sum
withdrawals from their pensions after quitting their jobs last year.
The wife started her own business and the husband spent the second
half of the year negotiating to buy his own company. They had a
variety of investments, owned two homes and were willed a third home
by the wife's mother, who died during the year.
   A year ago, Money magazine asked 50 professional return preparers
to figure the taxes of a make-believe family. Then, too, they came
up with 50 different answers and their bottom-line figures varied by
as much as 50 percent.
   ``What's their excuse this year?'' the magazine asked.
   Wesley R. Fitzpatrick, a partner in the Portland, Ore., office of
Grant Thornton accountants, who designed this year's test, said he
was completedly surprised by the results.
   ``When the tax-reform law was new, you could understand the
confusion, but now it's hard to explain all the mistakes about
fundamental rules,'' Fitzpatrick said.
   The survey found that some of the professionals failed to ask the
right questions when they encontered something confusing about the
hypothetical family's finances. The GAO said that same shortcoming
was to blame for many of the mistakes made by the IRS people who
answer telephoned questions.
   Money's survey involved 30 certified public accountants, 12
preparers from franchise tax-preparation operations, three CPAs from
national accounting firms and five enrolled agents, who are
IRS-licensed tax-return preparers.
   Returns free of major mistakes were prepared by five CPAs not
affiliated with national companies, one enrolled agent, three
preparers from franchise outlets, and Fitzpatrick, the CPA who
devised the test.
   Money noted that the survey was conducted before much of the
computer software widely used in the business was ready for this
year's returns. ``In all probability, the computers would have
performed somewhat better than the preparers' pencils and
calculators, although Fitzpatrick maintains that software would not
have caught the most common mistakes,'' the magazine said.
   Although the hypothetical family had financial situations that
most Americans are not likely to encounter, the professional tax
preparers made mistakes in areas that are far more common. For
example, 16 of the 50 failed to note that the family's 13-year-old
son would be required to file a return because he earned $600 mowing
lawns.

<HEAD>Three Die In Forest Fire North Of French Riviera</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of firefighters battled a blaze in a
forest north of Nice today that has left three men dead and scorched
more than 500 acres of trees, the French news agency reported.
   About 300 firemen fought to contain the fire that began Sunday in
the forest that was a tinderbox as a result of the unusually dry
weather, Agence-France Presse reported.
   It was not known exactly what sparked the fire near the village
of Saint-Martin Vesubie, 40 miles northeast of Nice.
   France has been experiencing the driest winter in more than a
quarter century and no rain has fallen in the area north of the
French Riviera since Dec. 1. By mid-January an average of
eight-tenths of an inch of rain had fallen nationwide instead of the
usual 2.4 inches.
   ``The fire smolders under the trees and springs up in the least
gust of wind,'' an unidentified fireman told AFP.
   On Thursday afternoon, a National Forest Office worker died after
rocks and branches fell on him while he was fighting the fire, AFP
said. Ben Abdallah Djouari, a 50-year-old father of eight children,
died from injuries to his head after being pushed by the debris into
a 165-foot-deep ravine.
   Two men with Djouari were struck by falling rocks and were
evacuated by helicopter, the news agency reported.
   Also on Thursday, an ambulance carrying an injured firefighter,
Sebastien Antraygues, slid off the road and into a ravine, killing
him. Angraygues, 21, had been working in the forest since Sunday.
   The driver of the ambulance was seriously injured in the
accident. A number of other firefighters suffered minor injuries.
   On Tuesday, fireman Paul Brutus, 50, was found dead from unknown
causes in an area where he had been working.

<HEAD>Gravediggers Exhume Wrong Bodies For Murder Investigators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>

   Gravediggers ordered to exhume the corpse of a
man who may have been murdered apparently dug up the wrong body
twice and aren't sure where to dig next, a cemetery owner says.
   The Baltimore state's attorney's office ordered the exhumation of
the Rev. Rayfield Gilliard, 77, who died last year two weeks after
marrying a woman subsequently charged with killing four other people
for their life insurance benefits. Detectives want an autopsy to see
if he, too, was slain.
   The first body, removed in December from a pauper's grave at
Mount Zion Cemetery in Landsdowne just south of Baltimore, was
actually examined in an autopsy before someone noticed the
identification tag on it. The body didn't even resemble Gilliard,
said cemetery manager Samuel Brown.
   ``The body was a real thin, skinny man,'' Brown said. ``Mr.
Gilliard was a heavy-set man with big, full face.''
   Brown said his records wrongly indicated that Gilliard's body was
in row 83. After the mistake was discovered, Brown said he realized
Gilliard actually should be in row 78.
   Several weeks later, another body was exhumed. But a detective at
the grave found a toe tag with another man's name on it, so the body
was reburied.
   ``The detective couldn't make out the name on the tag. It was
W-I-L something. So we put the body back,'' Brown said.
   But Brown said he's not convinced the second body wasn't Gilliard.
   ``The detective showed me a picture of Mr. Gilliard, and when we
dug up the second coffin that guy looked exactly like Mr.
Gilliard,'' he said. ``Whoever embalmed him did a good job.''
   Joseph Russ, who owns the cemetery, promised Thursday ``to do our
best to find'' Gilliard's body. He blamed the erroneous burial
records on inexperienced cemetery workers.
   Police say the woman Gilliard married on Jan. 18, 1988, is
Geraldine Parrish, 52, who is accused of orchestrating four slayings
to collect the victims' insurance payments.
   Gilliard died 15 days after the wedding, leaving his $440 a month
in Social Security benefits, his home and about $1,000 to his wife.
   The death certificate said he died of arteriosclerotic
cardiovascular disease, a type of heart disease. But the Rev.
Alphonso Thompson, who married the couple, said that Gilliard didn't
have heart trouble as far as he knew.
   Last summer, Ms. Parrish was indicted and jailed, charged in four
deaths and three attempts to kill a fifth person. Police seized 45
insurance policies from locked closets and safes at Ms. Parrish's
home.

   A Japanese balloonist will abandon his attempt to
cross the Pacific Ocean alone because of unfavorable winds, and he
plans to land his craft in the ocean, an official said today.
   Project spokesman Ren Kato said Fumio Niwa will bring his giant
orange-and-blue balloon down Saturday after an airplane determines
his exact location.
   Today the balloon was floating 4.4 miles above the ocean 1,450
miles southeast of Tokyo.
   A boat from the Maritime Safety Agency left Yokohama for the area
today but was not likely to arrive until Sunday night, Kato said, so
Niwa could end up bobbing in the sea in his tiny gondola for more
than a day.
   When he took off early Wednesday, Niwa hoped to travel 5,000
miles to San Diego in about four days and become the first person to
cross the ocean alone in a balloon.
   He planned to ride the jet stream _ high-speed, high-altitude
winds that generally blow west to east _ but changed his mind when
he discovered the jet stream would have pushed him north toward
Alaska.
   Niwa initially stayed at a low altitude and traveled south in an
attempt to catch the southernmost edge of the jet stream. He then
jettisoned most of his ballast and rose in altitude, but missed the
high-speed winds, said Hiroaki Tanaka, another project spokesman.
   ``The loss of the ballast means he no longer is able to maneuver
up and down to find a good wind,'' Tanaka said.
   The 38-year-old balloonist lifted off from Yokohama, southwest of
Tokyo, in the 6-foot-wide plastic gondola, which he designed himself.
   The capsule is pressurized and can float but has no navigational
or heating equipment. Niwa relies on amateur radio reports based on
satellite trackings to pinpoint his location.
   The temperature was 23 degrees inside the gondola this morning
and minus 13 degrees outside, Tanaka said.
   Battery-powered electric coils in Niwa's flying suit keep him
warm.
   Niwa quit his job with a computer firm three months ago to
prepare for the flight. He said he planned to sleep during the day
and stay awake at night.
   In 1981, four men crossed the Pacific Ocean by balloon for the
first time, but no one has traveled the distance alone.
   Niwa, who has 1,000 hours of ballooning experience, estimated the
flight would cost about $540,000, a sum he had hoped to regain by
writing a book and lecturing about his experience.

   Authorities investigating a major stock scandal
today raided the main offices of the Labor Ministry and nine of its
other facilities, and they arrested a former ministry official.
   Shigeru Kano, 55, former head of the Labor Ministry's employment
service division, became the eighth suspect and the first former
government official to be arrested in connection with the scandal.
Since the scandal broke, 20 people, including three government
ministers, have resigned their positions.
   Kano resigned from his post in January after reports surfaced
linking him to the stock scandal, in which selected politicians,
bureaucrats and others were offered bargain-priced unlisted shares
in Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real estate subsidiary of the
information-service conglomerate Recruit Co.
   Shareholders earned large profits after the stock was offered for
over-the-counter trading, raising the issue of bribery and
favor-granting on the part of those involved.
   The Tokyo District Prosecutors Office and Justice Ministry
officials charged Kano played a major role in easing restrictions on
employment information publishing, a move that would benefit Recruit
Co., which earns 60 percent of its income from publishing
employment-related information.
   Recruit officials allegedly spent $10,000 wining and dining Kano
in return for his assistance in easing the restrictions, prosecutors
claim.
   Following Kano's arrest, 15 investigators from the prosecutors
office raided the main building of the Ministry of Labor, as well as
nine other ministry-related facilities, to search for evidence
against the former official, who resigned in January.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita described the raid on a public
office as ``a very serious matter.'' He addressing legislators in a
parliamentary committee but refused further comment on the latest
development, saying he didn't yet have all the details.
   Public support for Takeshita has been severely waning, a number
of public opinion surveys have shown recently. A relative and an
aide of Takeshita were invited to purchase the Recruit-Cosmos
shares, but the prime minister himself has denied knowledge of the
transactions.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi, another high-ranking
involved in the scandal, said today that he regretted the arrest of
a public official.
   ``From the standpoint of establishing strict descipline among
public servants, it is regrettable that (the arrest) has in effect
led to loss of public trust in the labor administration,'' Obuchi
said in a news conference.
   Also today, opposition parties stepped up demands in the Diet, or
Japanese parliament, that former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
appear before a parliamentary committee for questioning on his own
links to Recruit.
   Nakasone was one of 17 politicians who earned hefty profits in
the transaction of unlisted shares. On Thursday, legislators raised
questions regarding Nakasone's role as then-prime minister in the
purchase of two U.S. supercomputers.
   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., a government
telecommunications monopoly until its privatization in 1985,
purchased two multi-million-dollar supercomputers from
Minneapolis-based Cray Research Inc. and resold them to Recruit in
1986.
   The supercomputers, operated by Recruit, have been kept on NTT
premises until now and maintained by NTT technicians. Opposition
lawmakers have charged Recruit is receiving favorable treatment and
that Nakasone played a role in arranging the purchase and
maintenance setup.
   Naohiko Okubo, secretary general of the second-largest opposition
party Komeito, called on Takeshita today to disclose the contents of
the meeting between Nakasone and former President Reagan in May 1987
in Washington, during which an agreement over the supercomputer
purchase was reportedly reached. Okubo was addressing a nationally
televised parliamentary committee session.

<HEAD>Woman With AIDS Virus Wins Fight Against Beauty Salons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state hearing examiner has ordered two beauty
salons to serve a woman they turned away because she was infected
with the AIDS virus.
   The consent order, coming two years after Tema Luft, 36, was
turned away by the salons, preliminarily establishes the legal
principle that people with AIDS-related illnesses are protected by
Maryland's anti-discrimination laws.
   ``This sends a message to businesses that are discriminating or
might discriminate that if they do so, they are going to be charged
with violating state law,'' Lee Hoshall, a lawyer for the state
Human Relations Commission, said Thursday.
   Under the consent order approved Tuesday by a hearing examiner
for the commission, the Nail Gallery in Reisterstown and All that
Glitters in Pikesville agreed to serve Ms. Luft and others infected
with the AIDS virus.
   The case marked the first time a hearing examiner ruled that a
state law protecting handicapped people from discrimination applies
to people infected with the virus that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   The consent order averts a quasi-judicial hearing on the
complaint.
   Ms. Luft, a C&amp;P Telephone Co. employee who contracted the AIDS
virus in 1985, said the settlement may not change attitudes toward
the disease but will at least give infected individuals legal
ammunition if they are faced with discrimination.
   She said she was unsure whether she would return to the salons
for service.
   Both salons had served Ms. Luft until she made a televised
appearance at an AIDS conference.
   ``My clients are naturally glad the case is over,'' said Thomas
Bowden, attorney for the owners of All That Glitters. ``They hold no
grudge about Tema and cetainly wish her well in dealing with her
illness.''
   A woman answering the phone at the Nail Gallery today said she
was the owner but would not comment on the ruling or give her name.

<TEXT>
   Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, abducted
a year ago today while serving as a U.N. observer, is alive despite
his captors' statement that he was sentenced to death as a spy, a
Shiite Moslem leader said.
   ``He'll be released eventually'' by the pro-Iranian Shiite
extremists who seized him, Abdul Majid Saleh, political officer of
the Amal militia in this ancient port 50 miles south of Beirut, said
Thursday.
   Higgins, from Danville, Ky., commanded a 76-man U.N. observer
group monitoring the Lebanon-Israel border. He was kidnapped by
gunmen who stopped his car on the highway south of Tyre 20 minutes
after he had met with Saleh.
   Saleh would not say how he knew Higgins had not been killed by
the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, which claimed
responsibility for the abduction.
   His militia claims to have undercover agents who track hostage
developments. The moderate Shiite movement, backed by Syria, opposes
the pro-Iranian fundamentalist Shiites who hold most of the 15
foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   Amal and Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella group for those
holding the hostages, were at war for months and nearly 600 people
were killed. They reached a peace agreement in January that was
mediated by Syria and Iran.
   In an interview today on ABC television's ``Good Morning
America,'' Higgins' wife, Robin, said she held out hope that Saleh's
comments about her husband being alive were true. ``Of course we've
seen many reports, some very much in conflict with that. I hope it's
true. I hope we get better news and I hope we get him released
soon,'' she said.
   Militia officials and other sources interviewed in south Lebanon
shed new light on Higgins' abduction near Tyre on Feb. 17, 1988. His
44th birthday was Jan. 19.
   A security source told The Associated Press that members of Amal
tried to rescue Higgins three days after he was kidnapped, but were
overwhelmed by Hezbollah gunmen in the village of Jibcheet.
   He said 15 Amal fighters ``infiltrated Jibcheet the night of Feb.
20 last year and surrounded the house where Higgins was being held.
A dozen gunmen were guarding Higgins, but Amal was determined to set
him free.
   ``A few shots were fired, after which about 200 Hezbollahis
surrounded the Amal men and disarmed them. A golden opportunity to
release Higgins was lost.''
   No independent confirmation of the report was available, but Amal
did make a considerable effort to find Higgins. Angered that he was
kidnapped in territory it considered its turf, the militia created a
dragnet and rounded up scores of Hezbollah activists.
   Reflecting on the meeting a year ago, Saleh said: ``We talked
about the hostages and several other things.''
   Nine of the foreign captives in Lebanon are Americans, including
Terry A. Anderson, 41, who has been held the longest. Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Higgins' unit, since withdrawn, was attached to the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon. Its 5,800 men from nine nations patrol a narrow
strip of south Lebanon separating Israel's self-proclaimed
``security zone'' from the rest of the predominantly Shiite region.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the peacekeeping force, said: ``As a
peacekeeper, Higgins didn't deserve such a treatment. We hope that
one day the kidnappers will realize what a mistake they made and
release him.''
   Goksel, interviewed at the force's headquarters in the coastal
village of Naqoura, said U.N. officials have ``no way of knowing''
whether the kidnappers carried out the threat to kill Higgins. They
made it in a statement Dec. 12, the last received about the U.S.
Marine.
   U.N. and U.S. government have denied allegations by the
kidnappers that Higgins was a spy for Israel and was planning
possible missions to rescue the other Americans.
   Mohammed Harqous, Amal's security chief in Tyre, said ``the
abduction was perfectly planned and carried out.''
   He said the kidnappers ``drove Higgins in heavy rain through 10
villages and changed cars three times in the Tyre region before
crossing the Litani River on foot the night of Feb. 18.''
   Harqous said Higgins ``injured one of his legs during the rough
hike'' northward and ``one of the kidnappers carried Higgins on his
back across the Litani.'' He would not reveal his sources of
information.
   Higgins then was taken to Jibcheet, Harqous said, but he would
not comment on the report of a rescue attempt by Amal.
   According to the security source, ``a few days after the
confrontation'' his captors took Higgins to a base on the slopes
around Louwaizeh village, near the western flank of Israel's
security zone.
   ``Higgins was held in Louwaizeh for about 40 days ... within a
five-minute drive of the security zone,'' the source said. ``Early
last April, Higgins was moved in a car fitted with diplomatic
license plates from Louwaizeh to south Beirut and he's been held
there ever since.''
   Hezbollah controls nearly all the Shiite slums of south Beirut
and most of the foreign captives are believed to be held there.

   A sniper fired more than 20 shots at a city
attorney and a video crew re-enacting a controversial fatal police
shooting of a retarded boy who had pointed a toy gun at officers,
police said.
   Deputy City Attorney Kimberly Reiley and about a dozen uniformed
and plainclothes officers were not injured in the incident Thursday,
said police Officer Peter Thoshinsky.
   About eight shots were fired at the film crew from an abandoned
unit at the Potrero Hill housing complex, Thoshinsky said. The
sniper, using a semiautomatic weapon, then fired another 15 rounds.
Police searched the area but did not find the gun or a suspect.
   The crew left after the shooting and did not complete the taping,
which is to be used in a civil case against the Police Department by
survivors of 13-year-old Silivelio ``Tony'' Grohse.
   The boy died last year after two officers mistook his toy pistol
for a real weapon and shot him.

   A controversial exhibition of avant-garde art
reopened today under tight security, two days after police closed it
because of a bomb threat.
   The show was also closed on opening day, Feb. 5, for five days
when artists defied a ban on performance art and one fired two BBs
into her sculpture.
   Uniformed guards patrolled the three floors of the China Art
Gallery today as crowds of mainly young people gathered in front of
the paintings and sculptures. Guards were posted at the main gate of
the museum, and no bags or large packages were allowed inside.
   Police closed the show Wednesday after a Beijing newspaper
received a letter saying bombs would be planted in the gallery if
the show was not shut for good. Organizers said they believe an
artist was responsible for the threat, which they view as a hoax.
   ``It seems to be another kind of performance art,'' said one
organizer. ``We think the artist is trying to show art's
relationship with Chinese society.''
   On Feb. 5, a series of performance art pieces culminating in the
shooting of a telephone booth sculpture by the artist led
authorities to close the show. The artist and her boyfriend were
detained for three days and then released.
   The show is the largest avant-garde show in China's history,
filling five large halls of the China Art Gallery with more than 250
works. It is the first large-scale exhibition of Chinese modern art
to be held in Beijing since 1981.

<HEAD>Courthouse Toilets Explode When Compressor Connected to Water Line</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About two dozens toilets and urinals in the King
County Courthouse exploded when they were flushed after an air
compressor was mistakenly connected to a water line, officials said.
   ``We think we've lost about 20 to 25 toilets,'' building services
manager Bill Kemp said Thursday. ``The porcelain is actually
cracked.''
   Each time the pressurized privies were flushed in restrooms
throughout the 72-year-old building, plumbing started popping, Kemp
said. Instead of the usual swirl and gurgle of water, geysers
erupted.
   Officials eventually traced the problem to an erroneous
compressor hookup by a construction worker on a nearby $430 million
bus tunnel project.
   ``They started blowing at about 11:30 (a.m.) and it took us a
while to figure it out,'' he recounted. ``We knew it had to be air
in the system, but the (city) Water Department said that was
impossible.''
   Kemp said there were no reports of injuries, although several
people apparently were soaked.
   After the incident, all courthouse restrooms were closed for the
day, and employees and others had to walk across the street to
toilets in the county Administration Building. Kemp said most
courthouse toilets would be back in operation today. Damage has yet
to be determined.

<DATELINE>MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of five North African
nations today signed a treaty creating a common market and joining
their countries in a union to compete with a united Europe.
   The chiefs of state of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and
Mauritania signed the document creating the ``Union of the Arab
Great Maghreb'' in Marrakech City Hall at the end of a three-day
summit.
   ``Maghreb'' is the Arab word for ``west'' and is generally used
to designate the Arab countries west of Egypt.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's last minute proposal to expand
the treaty to include Sudan, Chad, Mali and Niger was quietly
dropped. Instead, the leaders inserted a line in the text leaving
the treaty open to include ``other Arab or African countries'' at a
later date.
   The treaty would not have been possible without the recent
reconciliation of Morocco's King Hassan II and Algeria's Chadli
Bendjedid. The two countries had been on the brink of war for 15
years over Algeria's support for the Polisario guerrilla movement in
the Moroccan-annexed Western Sahara.
   Morocco claims the former Spanish territory.
   With U.N. help, the quarrel was resolved.
   Immediately after the signing ceremony, the leaders went to the
1,000-year-old Koutoubia Mosque to pray.
   The main body of the union is a council made up of the five
chiefs of state. It will meet at least once a year to make decisions
and set policy on a variety of economic issues. All decisions must
be reached unanimously with any single nation having the right to
veto.
   A commission of prime ministers and foreign ministers will handle
day-to-day affairs.
   The goal is for individuals and goods to be able someday to move
freely through the 2-million-square-mile North African region. In
addition, trade agreements with foreign states or groups of states
will be negotiated jointly.
   The leaders also plan to institute a single identity card for all
citizens of the new union.
   The Arab leaders found motivation for their treaty in the
European Economic Community's plans for a Europe without borders.
Under a plan by the 12-member EEC, the arrangement would be in place
after 1992 and would permit the free flow of goods and people
throughout Europe.

   A serial killer is preying on prostitutes in
the same crime-infested area that gave rise to the Southside Slayer,
and may have killed as many as 12 women, authorities said.
   ``I will confirm that an investigation is currently being
conducted on female victims who were engaged in prostitution for
drugs,'' said police Lt. Fred Nixon, a department spokesman.
   Police Lt. John Zorn, who is coordinating the latest
investigation, said Thursday that at least nine of the most recent
victims were killed with the same weapon.
   ``There's one gun. They have one weapon used over and over,''
Zorn said. ``It's a small handgun. This type and caliber of handgun
has been targeted by the department.''
   ``You don't know there's one killer until several deaths occur,''
Zorn said. ``Once they make the connection and see the same gun,
they realize they have the same suspect.''
   Television station KABC reported Thursday that as many as 12
prostitutes have been found shot to death in the area since August
1985.
   Zorn also headed the task force that investigated the so-called
Southside Slayer Task Force, whose victims were found strangled in
South Central Los Angeles between September 1983 and July 1986. Most
of them had been stabbed, and all but a few had arrest records for
prostitution.
   One man has been convicted of one of the slayings and two others
were charged separately in seven of the killings.
   KABC said police have been quietly investigating the latest
string of killings for a year, which drew criticism from community
activist Margaret Prescod, who called such a low-profile approach
outrageous.
   ``It feels as though history is repeating itself,'' she said.
``Eleven women were already murdered before they called the press
conference to tell us about the Southside Slayer.''
   KABC said the investigation had been kept quiet because of fears
that publicity would bring protests from residents, but Nixon denied
that was the case.
   ``Our reluctance to publicize the killings has nothing to do with
a fear of any major demonstrations,'' he said.
   Police added they are warning women who fit the profile of those
murdered to be cautious.
   Nixon said the victims are called ``strawberries'' in street
jargon because they sell sex for drugs, but declined to give further
background on them.

<HEAD>Director of Firm Accused in Libyan Scandal Attempts Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAHR, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of a chemical company
accused of helping Libya build a suspected poison gas plant was
found unconscious in his car after attempting suicide, police said
today.
   Hans Renner, the 60-year-old executive director of the embattled
Imhausen-Chemie firm, was discovered by forestry workers at 12:30
p.m. Thursday after he had consumed something apparently intended to
kill him, said a Lahr Police Department spokesman, Emil Roth.
   Roth said Renner left no written message as to his reasons for
the suicide attempt but that officers were speaking with his wife
about his presumed motives. The spokesman declined to specify what
substance Renner had consumed.
   Renner, whose car was discovered in a forest outside of Lahr
where he lives, remained unconscious today at the regional hospital.
   He had been directing affairs at the chemical company since its
president, Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, left the country shortly
after U.S. authorities accused the company of having provided key
technical assistance to Libya in building the plant at Rabta.
   U.S. and West German authorities say they have intelligence
evidence showing the plant is intended to produce poison gases.
Libya, however, contends it is a pharmaceutical factory.
   Roth said he was not authorized to comment on Renner's possible
motives for the suicide attempt or other details of the case.

<TEXT>
   Guy Laroche, who abandoned dreams of a medical
career to become one of the world's most popular fashion designers,
died today following a long battle with intestinal cancer, a company
spokesman said. He was 65.
   Laroche died at his home in a fashionable Right Bank neighborhood
at about 1 a.m. surrounded by his family and friends, said Jean-Paul
Caboche, a spokesman for Guy Laroche SA.
   During the last showing of Paris haute couture, Laroche won the
prestigious Golden Thimble award for the season's most beautiful
clothes. It was the second time he had won the prize.
   The designer was greeted with enthusiastic applause when he
appeared on stage with his models Jan. 25. He looked gaunt, and many
fashion insiders speculated the show would be his last.
   Laroche once said ``eccentricity is not the synonym for
elegance,'' and during his long career his strength was in knowing
how to seize a fashion mood and translate it into clothes that would
attract attention without shocking. His style was young and elegant,
known for luscious fabrics and vibrant colors.
   The designer's clientele included film star Mireille Darc and
Bernadette Chirac, wife of Paris Mayor and former Premier Jacques
Chirac.
   Jacques Mouclier, executive president of the Chambre Syndicale de
la Couture, the professional association of the couture industry,
called Larouche ``courageous'' for working nearly up to the time of
his death.
   ``He was truly a friend and a great man _ simple, unaffected. He
never acted like a star,'' Mouclier said.
   Laroche, born July 16, 1921, was the son of a hotel owner in the
Atlantic port of La Rochelle. He planned a career in medicine but
became fascinated by clothes at the age of 19, when a friend took
him to see a fashion show.
   ``Dazzled by the clothes, I then began to sketch myself,'' he
said in an interview.
   Laroche showed some of his sketches to the couturier Jean Desses
and became his assistant in 1949. He spent a few months in New York
studying manufacturing methods, becoming inspired by Dior,
Balenciaga, Fath and Balmain.
   In 1957, Laroche opened his own couture house and two years
later, Macy's awarded him its prize for outstanding creation.
   In 1961, Laroche launched a ready-to-wear line, which soon earned
renown among discriminating women as the most reasonably priced
outfits sold by any big name French house.
   He introduced a line of menswear in 1967.
   In the 1970s, Guy Douvier took over designing ready-to-wear under
Laroche's supervision, and the number of Laroche's boutiques swelled
to 250 worldwide, including shops in New York, Dallas and Houston.
He also created perfumes.
   In July 1985, the modest couturier was awarded the Golden Thimble
prize for excellence for his autumn-winter couture collection.
   By 1987, the Laroche operation boasted a global turnover of about
$270 million.
   In April 1987, Chirac awarded Laroche the Chevalier of the Legion
of Honor, citing his contributions to France, including
``maintaining a certain image of our country with which we closely
identify _ that of taste and elegance.''
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.

<HEAD>Personal Conduct Focus of Tower Reports</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 6th graf, The review, to CORRECT that ABC said 14 liaisons
by delegation members, not Tower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The personal conduct of Defense
secretary-designate John Tower has overtaken his Pentagon business
dealings as a focus of investigators' attention as lawmakers prepare
to take up his nomination.
   Of particular concern is Tower's 16-month stint in Geneva as head
of the American delegation that met with the Soviets to discuss
mutual cuts in long-range nuclear missiles. The former Texas senator
was there from January 1985 to April 1986.
   According to a report in today's Washington Times, details on
Tower's sexual activities in Geneva would come out in a closed
hearing of a House subcommittee investigating allegations of
security violations by another member of the delegation.
   The newspaper reported that an investigator from the State
Department and one from the Air Force were to arrive Saturday from
Geneva. The investigators are to appear at a session of the House
Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee headed
by Rep. John Dingell, D.-Mich.
   The Times report, which deals with a hearing on allegations
against retired Air Force Lt. Col. Robert Moser, says allegations
about Tower arose in an Office of Personnel Management review on
Moser's request for a Department of Energy security clearance.
   The review said Tower kept both his secretaries in Geneva as
mistresses, the newspaper reported. Two weeks ago, ABC News said an
Air Force colonel claimed there were 14 separate liaisons involving
members of the U.S. delegation in Switzerland.
   In another published report, The Washington Post said today that
the FBI report summarizing the bureau's findings has uncovered no
evidence linking him to the Pentagon procurement scandal or illegal
campaign contributions. But the newspaper quoted one source as
saying the report would contain ``a wealth of allegations about the
guy's personal conduct.''
   Tom Kirk, the FBI agent who wrote the report, told the newspaper
the report will contain new information on Tower that has not been
made public.
   Tower has been dogged by allegations of drinking and
philandering. Many senators also have voiced concern whether Tower
could avoid conflicts of interest after receiving more than $1
million as a consultant for major defense contractors since he left
the Senate four years ago.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, which is reviewing the nomination, has said that an
investigation of Tower's actions in Geneva found no security
breaches.
   Additionally, Nunn said Wednesday in Rome, Ga., that if members
of the full Senate bring up questions about Tower's personal life
the lawmakers may be forced to meet behind closed doors.
   ``I hope not, but it depends on the type of questions posed on
the Senate floor by senators who are not members of the Senate Armed
Services Committee,'' Nunn said, referring to the Senate
deliberations should the nomination clear his panel.
   ``I emphasize that the leadership of the Senate will make this
decision, not the Armed Services Committee or its chairman,'' he
said.
   A closed session of the full Senate is highly unusual, occurring
on average about once a year and usually relating to national
security issues.
   The last closed session occurred on March 29, 1988, when the
Senate met to discuss the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty
with the Soviet Union.
   Tower's conduct in Geneva also drew criticism this week from the
Reagan administration's former arms control chief, Kenneth L.
Adelman.
   Although impressed with Tower's performance as a strategic arms
negotiator, Adelman said the former Texas senator's ``lack of
discretion proved troublesome then, as before and since.''
   Tower's private behavior didn't directly affect his conduct of
official business at the Geneva talks, Adelman said. But Adelman
said Tower's conduct should be a factor in the Senate confirmation
deliberations because ``a defense secretary has no private life.''
   Adelman, in a Los Angeles Times interview published Thursday and
in a Washington Times column on Wednesday, provided no details on
what activities proved ``troublesome.''

   A four-alarm fire broke out early today in a
downtown hotel, killing at least four people and forcing some
residents to slide down makeshift ropes of blankets and sheets in
freezing weather, officials said.
   Fire officials said arson was suspected.
   At least 52 people were sent to hospitals. Four police officers
trying to evacuate the residential hotel were among the injured.
   The fire was discovered at 3:12 a.m. at the Billinghurst Hotel by
police Sgt. John Stevenson, who was on routine patrol, police
spokesman Sgt. Christopher Buck said.
   Buck said Stevenson got one resident out of the building, called
the fire department, then went back in to alert other residents.
   Temperatures were in the teens while some residents tied sheets
and blankets together to slide from their windows down the
five-story building's walls.
   Aubrey Chappell, 25, said he was awakened in his second-story
room by the smell of smoke.
   ``Then I opened the door and I couldn't breathe,'' he said. ``I
went to the window, tied sheets (together), grabbed my credentials
and climbed out.''
   ``There were quite a few jumpers, as you can see these sheets
hanging out of windows,'' said Deputy Fire Chief Salvatore Finazzo.
   Authorities suspect an arsonist started the blaze on the hotel's
first floor, Finazzo said, but he refused to elaborate.
   Residents and fire officials estimated 130 to 200 people, most
welfare recipients, lived in the brick hotel.
   The building had no sprinkler system, but some residents said
they heard smoke alarms sounding.
   Buck said the identities and cause of death of the four dead
people were unconfirmed. The injured were taken to four hospitals.
   Buck said at least three of the hurt, some of whom were injured
while jumping out of windows, were in critical condition.
   The injured officers suffered from smoke inhalation, broken bones
and other injuries. Their conditions were unknown.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has sent messages to
President Bush and other world leaders asking for help in ending the
war in Afghanistan, a Soviet official announced today.
   The Soviets pulled the last of more than 100,000 troops out of
Afghanistan on Wednesday. However, U.S.-backed insurgents there have
pledged to keep fighting until they overthrow the pro-Moscow
government of President Najib.
   Alexander A. Bessmertnykh, the Soviet first deputy foreign
minister, said today that his country appealed on Thursday to many
nations and world organizations to take a part in stabilizing the
situation in Afghanistan.
   He told a government news briefing the appeals called for
economic and humanitarian assistance. Bessmertnykh declined to
disclose the contents of the letter Gorbachev sent to Bush.
   The leaders of France, Britain, West Germany, China, Pakistan and
Iran also received messages from the Soviets, the minister said.
   Appeals were also sent to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, the leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement, the Islamic
Conference, the Organization of African Unity, the Arab League, the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Common Market,
Bessmertnykh said.
   ``We believe that all countries should respond to the emerging
opportunity to put an end to the drawn-out conflict by promoting the
complete and fast settlement of the situation and the reinstatement
of Afghanistan as a prosperous, strong, independent, neutral and
non-aligned nation,'' he said.
   In Washington, Bush said on Thursday the United States will
continue helping guerrilla groups in Afghanistan despite the Soviet
army's withdrawal.
   Bush also said he was concerned that departing Soviet forces may
have stockpiled weapons for the government in Kabul.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 to
preside over the replacement of one Marxist leader by another. They
stayed on to fight the anti-government insurgency. The Soviets
pulled out under a U.N.-brokered agreement reached last April in
Geneva.

<TEXT>
   The picture of a father wailing on
the coffin of his son who was killed in the Armenian earthquake won
the annual World Press Photo award for American David C. Turnley, it
was announced Friday.
   The photo by Turnley, who works for the Detroit Free Press and
the Black Star agency, was chosen Photo of the Year from 10,197
entries submitted 1,287 press photographers from 62 nations, said
Marloes Krijnen, director of the privately funded World Press Photo
foundation.
   Boris Yurchenko, a staff photographer in the Moscow bureau of The
Associated Press, won the first prize in the People in the News
category with a picture of the Soviet Politburo voting President
Andrei Gromyko out of office.
   The Armenian earthquake and other natural disasters, such as the
floods that hit Bangladesh, dominated 1988's crop of top press
photos, according to John G. Morris, European correspondent for the
National Geographic and chairman of the nine-member jury.
   However, ``With wars on the wane, the look of the world is
becoming less tragic,'' Morris said during the presentation of the
winning pictures.
   Turnley will receive $2,500 with the award, which has been
awarded annually since 1955.
   Other winners included West Germany's Martin Fueger of the DPA
news agency, whose picture of the collision of two Italian stunt
planes during an air show in Ramstein, West Germany, earned him the
top slot in the Spot News category.
   In the Sports category, American photographer Brian Smith of the
Agence France Presse won a first prize with an action picture of
Greg Louganis, a U.S. diver who hit his head on the diving board
during the Olympics in Seoul.

<HEAD>Najib Says Peace Possible In Afghanistan Within Weeks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Gorbachev asking Bush for help in
ending the war, RAISES Bush and Vorontsov comments. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Najib said today the nation's
war could end in a negotiated settlement within weeks and that
representatives of his Marxist government have talked with Moslem
guerrillas.
   The Soviet Union said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent
messages to President Bush and other world leaders asking for help
in ending the war.
   The main highway connecting Kabul to the Soviet Union, which
Soviet troops used to withdraw, remained open, Tass said, quoting
the Afghan Bakhtar news agency. Tass, the official Soviet news
agency, said more than 100 trucks carrying Soviet food and supplies
were bound for the Afghan capital.
   Najib also said he had sent emissaries to Rome to talk with
former Afghan King Zahir Shah and that his government had been in
contact with the Moslem guerrilla resistance. He did not elaborate.
   Yuli Vorontsov, Soviet deputy foreign minister, gave a similar
report at a news conference in New Delhi, where he met with
government officials in talks aimed at ending the war between the
Afghan government and the guerrillas.
   Vorontsov said some guerrilla groups were in contact with the
Kabul government, despite their public vows against any negotiations
with Najib. ``Some dealing exists already _ clandestinely,'' he said
without elaborating.
   When Najib was asked by Western reporters whether there could be
peace in days or months, he replied: ``Maybe weeks.''
   But he has repeatedly insisted that any political settlement must
include the governing People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   Some Western officials believe the Moslem guerrillas will soon
capture key Afghan cities now that the Soviet troops are gone.
   Alexander A. Bessmertnykh, the Soviet First Deputy foreign
minister, told reporters in Moscow today that his country appealed
on Thursday to many nations and world organizations to take a part
in stabilizing the Afghan situation.
   He said the appeals called for economic and humanitarian
assistance, but he declined to describe the contents of the message
Gorbachev sent to Bush.
   ``We believe that all countries should respond to the emerging
opportunity to put an end to the drawn-out conflict by promoting the
complete and fast settlement of the situation,'' the Soviet official
said.
   In Washington, Bush said Thursday that the United States will
continue helping guerrilla groups in Afghanistan after the Soviet
army's withdrawal. The guerrillas say the government will soon fall.
   Bush said he was concerned that departing Soviet forces may have
stockpiled weapons for the Marxist government in Kabul.
   In New Delhi, Vorontsov criticized the Bush administration for
continuing its aid to the insurgents. He said it was trying to
plunge Afghanistan into a bloodbath following the Soviet withdrawal.
   Vorontsov, Moscow's chief Afghan negotiator and its ambassador to
Kabul, said he would continue trying to find a political solution in
Afghanistan.
   Neighboring Pakistan too has continued to help the guerrillas,
which are based on its territory.
   In Kabul, Najib wore a Western suit and an Islamic-style cap as
he attended morning prayers at a mosque near the presidential
palace. He was protected by about 60 security guards who formed a
circle around him. He has been under increasing pressure to reach a
settlement with the insurgents who have been fighting since 1978 to
overthrow the Soviet-backed government.
   Under a U.N.-sponsored agreement, Moscow on Wednesday withdrew
the last of the estimated 115,000 Red Army troops it once had in
Afghanistan. It began sending them there in December 1979 to prop up
the Marxist government.
   More than 1 million people, including 15,000 Soviet soldiers,
died in the fighting. Another 35,000 Red Army troops were injured in
the war.

<HEAD>Report: Urban Rebels Plan To Kill Five People A Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist guerrillas operating in the
nation's cities say they plan to kill five people a month in their
fight against the government, according to a report published today.
   Also today, the military reported that 21 people were killed
Thursday in clashes between government troops and communist rebels.
   The tabloid People's Journal Tonight today reproduced a crudely
scribbled note the newspaper said it received Thursday from the Alex
Boncayao Brigade, or ABB, the urban assassination unit of the
communist New People's Army.
   ``Five officials a month is our quota,'' said the note, which was
signed ``ABB-Jomar Squad.'' An accompanying article said that
shortly before the note was delivered, a man claiming to be a rebel
spokesman telephoned the newspaper's office with the same message.
   On Wednesday, four men gunned down a constabulary intelligence
officer in the Manila suburb of Malabon and left a note signed
``A.B.B.-Jomar Squad.''
   A military officer and an enlisted man were shot to death Monday
on Manila's outskirts by suspected rebels. One of the assailants
also was killed in the gunfire. The Alex Boncayao Brigade claimed
responsibility.
   In one of the military attacks Thursday, 10 soldiers and a
civilian cook were killed when 200 New People's Army rebels fired on
two army trucks packed with troops in Misamis Occidental province,
the military said.
   The soldiers were disembarking from their trucks in Calamba
municipality, 450 miles southeast of Manila, when the rebels opened
fire, the report said.
   It said scores of people were injured and that the bodies of
eight guerrillas were found after a firefight of several hours.
   Also Thursday, rebels sprayed a constabulary patrol car with
bullets in the town of San Simon in Pampanga province, 30 miles
north of Manila, and killed one soldier, another military report
said.
   A rebel also was killed in the attack, the report said.

   Flood waters began to recede in parts of Tennessee and Kentucky
but the mighty Ohio and other rivers rose today after a week of
unrelenting rain flooded homes and forced the evacuation of hundreds
of residents.
   A central Kentucky town became an island when swirling, muddy
water encapsuled it Thursday. The only way out was by boat or
helicopter. Three people were killed and a child was missing after
their car was swept away in a rain-swollen creek near Mineral Wells,
Texas.
   Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter asked the U.S. Small Business
Administration on Thursday to designate eight middle Tennessee
counties as flood disaster areas. Kentucky officials said they would
seek similar federal relief.
   ``We hope the worst of it is over,'' Kentucky Gov. Wallace
Wilkinson said after touring some of the hardest-hit areas of his
state.
   Although the rain let up Thursday, Cecil Whaley, an operations
officer for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, said today
that forecasters were watching a storm in Texas expected to move
into the state.
   ``It appears to be headed toward us. ... Either Kentucky or
Tennessee will get a lot of moisture. We just don't know who it's
going to be,'' he said.
   A week's worth of rainfall, measuring more than 10 inches in some
places, flooded roads, forced schools to close and claimed at least
three lives.
   Kentucky officials estimated that at least 1,000 people were
forced from their homes by rising waters in most of the river
systems in the western two-thirds of the state.
   The Kentucky River crested today at 44.2 feet _ more than 13 feet
above flood stage _ at Frankfort in central Kentucky, and several
other rivers and streams also began receding, the National Weather
Service said. However, the Ohio and Green rivers were still rising
slightly and could force some river levels higher again, said
forecaster Mike Callahan in Louisville.
   In Tennessee, officials said Valentine's Day flooding in Wilson
County damaged 66 businesses and 28 homes around the city of
Lebanon, causing an estimated $1.9 million in damage.
   The rain-swollen Obion River burst through a levee in rural Obion
County early Thursday, sending a three-foot wall of water through
the towns of Rives and Obion, forcing 377 people from their homes,
officials said.
   At least 43 homes, seven mobile homes, two churches and a fire
station were saturated with water after the levee burst, said Whaley.
   ``A lot of the homes had up to 50 percent damage,'' he said. ``It
could be quite a while before they get back into them.''
   Whaley said the river had begun receding and damage assessment
would begin today.
   Flood waters turned the riverside community of Boston, Ky.,
population 400, into an island. The Rolling Fork of the Salt River
neared a crest of 52 feet today, three-tenths of a foot over its
previous record high.
   Conditions in Boston won't improve significantly until the Ohio
crests at Louisville, 23 miles north, Callahan said today.
   ``We're locked in,'' said Joe Sims, 35. ``It's the nearest thing
to suffocating.''
   All roads were blocked and residents couldn't even walk out.
   On Thursday, people strolled in the sunshine _ the first break
from rain in four days _ and picked up supplies at the town's only
open store, all the while warily eying the waters that were still
rising.
   ``We've got plenty of food. As long as nobody gets sick, we're
all right,'' said Betty Vandiver, who has lived in Boston for 32
years.
   Disaster officials in Kentucky said they hoped to have enough
information compiled today to make a preliminary request for federal
aid. Assistance could include low-interest loans and special
attention from federal relief programs.
   Chuck Bogart, a spokesman for the Division of Disaster and
Emergency Services, said firm figures on the actual damage caused by
the flooding will not be available until the waters recede.

   Five hand grenades were tossed
at a group of black police officers, killing one and injuring nine,
officials said today.
   Police said the attack occurred Thursday night in Kathlehong, a
black township east of Johannesburg.
   In Carletonville, 45 miles southwest of Johannesburg, blacks were
considering a boycott of white businesses in response to beatings of
blacks who venture out after dark, according to a report published
today.
   In the bombing incident, 10 special constables _ blacks assigned
to police duty in townships after shorter-than-normal training
periods _ were standing in a railway yard when one or more
assailants hurled five hand grenades, police said. Constable W.S.
Tladi was killed and nine officers were injured, two seriously,
police said.
   A similar attack occurred in Kathlehong Jan. 5, when one black
police officer was killed and 31 injured by a grenade thrown while
they were on parade. There was no claim of responsibility for either
attack.
   Police have blamed the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement for virtually all of the numerous attacks on
black officers, who are viewed by many black activists as
collaborators with the white government.
   The country's largest-circulation black newspaper, City Press,
reported that blacks in the mining town of Carletonville planned a
consumer boycott to protest beatings by whites of blacks seen on
local streets after dark.
   The town council is controlled by the extreme-right Conservative
Party and has proposed a curfew that would bar blacks from the town
center at night.
   A decision on the proposal is expected by the end of the month.
City Press said black activists would meet Sunday to discuss a
boycott.

<HEAD>Two Anti-Apartheid Publications Banned for Three Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today banned two
anti-apartheid publications for three months after accusing them of
repeatedly publishing subversive material.
   The publications, based in Cape Town and affiliated with each
other, are Grassroots, a monthly tabloid newspaper, and New Era, a
quarterly magazine.
   Three other anti-apartheid publications were banned for varying
periods last year under state-of-emergency regulations which give
broad censorship powers to Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha.
   He said Grassroots and New Era had carried articles ``promoting
revolution, stirring up hatred towards the security forces, and
promoting the public esteem of unlawful organizations, such as the
African National Congress.''
   The outlawed African National Congress is the leading group
fighting the South African system of apartheid, which enshrines
control by 5 million whites over a country with 26 million blacks.
   Grassroots was established in 1980 and distributes 50,000 copies
throughout the Cape Town region. New Era, a younger publication,
circulates 5,000 copies nationwide.
   In a statement responding to the banning, the staff of Grassroots
said: ``Today is a tragic one for the people of the Western Cape.''
   ``Our fate has been predetermined by an individual minister whose
subjective opinion cannot be challenged in a court of law,'' it
said. ``On May 17, we will back, and we will be continuing to
publish the truth.''

<HEAD>Racial Slurs Sent Via Police Computers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAWTHORNE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police officers in at least four
departments have used the mobile computer terminals in their patrol
cars to transmit racial and other slurs, authorities said.
   Police Chief Kenneth Stonebraker said three officers in his
department were disciplined for two incidents that have occurred
since 1986, and a third incident last weekend was still under
investigation.
   Robert Benson, executive director of the police communications
center that recorded the exchanges, said Thursday that officers at
the three other police departments the center serves _ Manhattan
Beach, Gardena and El Segundo _ have transmitted similar messages
over their computers in the last several years.
   The first incident reported in Hawthorne came to light earlier
this week when computer printouts kept at the communications center
were leaked to television station KCBS. They showed officers
transmitting racial, anti-homosexual and anti-Semitic jokes.
   ``They're inappropriate. There's no way to justify them,''
Stonebraker said. But he added he doesn't believe the three
incidents represent a festering problem within the department.
   Officers are told during training that computer printouts are
routinely kept of their computer exchanges, Stonebraker said.
   None of the officers has been identified.
   Jim Martin, western regional manager of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, called the incident
``extremely troubling.''
   ``The messages tell us blacks are not welcome in that
community,'' he said.
   Police Sgt. Don Jackson, who is on a stress-disability leave from
the Hawthorne department that he says was brought on by racial
discrimination, declined to comment on the messages.
   Jackson, who is black, recently set up a videotaped sting
operation against Long Beach police he said was designed to see if
charges of racism within that department were true.
   The videotape, broadcast nationally, shows a white officer
apparently slamming Jackson's head through a plate glass window
during a traffic stop.

   More than 100 detainees in a
Port Elizabeth prison ended a 3-week-old hunger strike today after
being told of a government promise to free some blacks being held
without charge.
   The decision by 105 detainees at St. Albans Prison was announced
by attorney Kobus Pienaar. It followed a decision Thursday by 170
detainees at a Johannesburg prision to end their hunger strike. An
undetermined number of other detainees continued their strike at
other prisons around South Africa.
   Prominent anti-apartheid detainees, including some who have been
hospitalized from the effects of the strike, were freed while
attorneys met with the minister of law and order aimed at more
releases.
   Trevor Manuel, regional director of the United Democratic Front
in the Cape Town area, was freed from Pollsmoor Prison, his lawyer's
office said. Manuel had not been part of the hunger strike that
began at Diepkloof prison outside Johannesburg on Jan. 23 and spread
to other prisons and jails in the country.
   Manuel had been detained since October. He previously had been
detained from August 1986 through July 1988.
   When Manuel was freed in July, he was ordered not to talk to
journalists, criticize the government, or participate in any
activities of the now-banned UDF, which was the nation's largest
anti-apartheid group.
   It was not immediately known if any restrictions were placed on
Manuel in connection with his release today.
   The minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok, said Thursday a
``substantial number'' of the estimated 1,000 blacks in custody
without charge would be released within two weeks, but he said some
would be placed under restrictions.
   None has been charged with a crime, but some have been held since
the national state of emergency was declared June 12, 1986.
   Ernest Dube, 26, a member of the Soweto Youth Congress who had
been hospitalized because of his hunger strike, was freed from
custody but remained in Johannesburg Hospital, said the Detainees
Aid Center.
   An attorney who met with Vlok told the South African Press
Association that three other men _ two of them in hospitals _ were
being freed today.

<HEAD>Researchers Did Not Uncover Arctic Ozone Hole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers said today the atmosphere over the
Arctic region ``is primed for a very large destruction of ozone''
but a six-week study did not uncover a vast ozone ``hole'' as had
been found over the South Pole.
   Scientists who led the recently concluded international research
effort into Arctic ozone depletion said there are clear chemical
signs that significant ozone destruction could occur over the Arctic
region, possibly within the next few weeks.
   However, ``there is no large ozone hole in the Arctic,'' Dr.
Robert Watson, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration
scientists and one of the research project leaders, told a news
conference.
   A Canadian scientist recently suggested in a study that an ozone
hole may be developing over the Arctic because of atmospheric
pollution. Watson said the latest research could not make that
conclusion.
   But he and Dr. Adrian Tuck, another project scientist, said the
research effort found ``strong evidence'' of an abundance of
chemically active chlorine compounds and other conditions in the
Arctic region that are key to the destruction of the ozone layer.
   An international team of scientists began the research effort in
early January and concluded it recently.
   Scientists are concerned about the destruction of ozone in the
stratosphere because it provides a protective layer against
ultraviolet rays of the sun. Overexposure to such rays has been
linked to skin cancer. Watson said it has been estimated that a 1
percent depletion of ozone causes a 2 percent increase in
ultraviolet radiation.
   A primary cause of ozone depletion is the release of
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, into the stratosphere. An
international treaty has called for the reduction of CFCs _ used as
a refrigerant and as a foam-blowing agent _ by 50 percent over the
next decade because of its harm to the ozone layer.
   The Arctic research effort, which involved scientists from the
United States, Britain and Norway, began Jan. 1 from a base in
Stavanger, Norway. It included 28 flights over the Arctic region
aboard an instrument-laden DC-8 and a high-altitude ER-2
surveillance aircraft to gather data.
   The researchers focused on a large ``vortex'' of westerly winds
over the Arctic region. They reported finding the stratosphere 12 or
more miles above the Arctic ``highly perturbed'' because of chemical
reactions, including the presence of high levels of man-made,
ozone-depleting chlorine oxide gasses.
   Furthermore, said the scientists, they confirmed an abundance of
high-level clouds formed by tiny particles of ice. These so-called
``polar stratospheric clouds'' intensify the chemical reaction that
destroys ozone because they provide a surface chlorine molecules.
   The researchers said the six-week study found no direct evidence
of Arctic ozone loss, but they concluded that ``a considerable
portion of the vortex air was primed for zone destruction'' and if
the amount of sunlight increases ozone could be destroyed ``at a
significant rate'' possibly as much as 1 percent a day while the
conditions exist.
   But they said the research provided no solid evidence as to how
much ozone destruction might occur over the Arctic. Scientists
previously have estimated that based on data collected from baloons
about 6 percent of the Arctic ozone may have been destroyed since
l970.
   The scientists said the degree of actual Arctic ozone destruction
in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including future
weather conditions, amount of sunlight and how long the wind
patterns remain in place.
   Nevertheless, said Tuck, ``the atmosphere (over the Arctic) is
primed for a very large destruction of ozone'' although scientists
do not foresee the degree of ozone destruction over the North Pole
as has been found over the Antarctic.
   ``We're not dealing with a 50 percent (ozone) loss situation
here,'' said Tuck, a scientist for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.

   With a strike deadline looming, a federal judge

   Senior U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins ruled the union must

   He also said work already begun on five aircraft by outside

Eastern has been barred from farming out any more such work during a
30-day cooling-off period in their stalled contract talks.
   If no agreement is reached by midnight March 3, Eastern is free

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today ruled that the
Immigration and Naturalization Service can reinstate a policy that
confines refugees to South Texas while their applications for
political asylum are considered.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela denied an
injunction sought by attorneys for refugees who sued the INS over
the no-travel policy.
   The regulation was blamed for a backup of hundreds of homeless
Central Americans at the southern tip of Texas. The judge on Jan. 9
temporarily ordered the INS to allow refugees to travel to their
intended U.S. destinations while he reviewed the request for a
permanent lifting of the no-travel policy.
   Many refugees then boarded buses for California and Florida.
   A report Thursday indicated Central American refugees might be
detained in a South Texas tent city while their applications for
political asylum are processed. U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, says
the facility would meet basic human necessities of adequate housing,
food and sanitary conditions. There would not be a fence.
   ``We think that's going to create a multitude of problems here in
the (Lower Rio Grande) Valley,'' Mark Schneider, one of the
attorneys who sued the INS over the matter, said after learning of
the judge's decision.
   The attorneys quickly appealed Vela's order. Attorney Linda Yanez
said she filed the appeal in Brownsville and asked for an injunction
against the INS pending that appeal.
   INS officials in Harlingen said they would comment on the ruling
later today.
   More than 100,000 Central Americans are expected to pour into the
area this year, after crossing the Rio Grande illegally near
Brownsville, according to the INS.
   INS officials last spring reported a large increase in the number
of Central Americans seeking political asylum in South Texas. The
agency had stamped asylum-seekers documents and allowed them to
travel to their declared U.S. destinations until Dec. 15, when faced
with huge case backlogs in cities such as Miami and Los Angeles, it
started requiring people to pursue their cases in Harlingen.
   Hundreds of immigrants started camping in squalid conditions in
makeshift tents and condemned buildings in the area, prompting a
local public outcry.
   Attorneys filed a class-action lawsuit against the INS,
contending it failed to seek public comment before making the
change, as required by federal law. The suit prompted Judge Vela to
issue the temporary restraining order that expires Monday.
   Vela today agreed with the INS that public comment was not
required for the travel restriction because it merely constituted
``general statements of agency organization, procedure, or
practice,'' and did not remove the opportunity to apply for asylum.
The changes were ``procedural, rather than substantive,'' Vela said.
   ``The changes merely alter the location of adjudication of the
asylum applications,'' he wrote.
   Asylum is granted to those fleeing various forms of persecution.
The INS contends, however, that most of those seeking asylum come to
the United States only for economic reasons, and therefore do not
qualify for asylum.
   Those suing the agency contend that the asylum-seekers should be
able to travel to cities where they have families and friends and
better access to legal representation while pursuing their cases.

   A Colombian who ran a major
money-laundering operation in the United States for some of the
world's biggest cocaine traffickers has been sentenced to 40 years
in prison.
   Carlos Restrepo, 38, of Medellin, who claims he was engaged in
the legitimate business of currency exchange, said after sentencing
Thursday he would appeal his conviction.
   Restrepo and three other men sentenced with him in U.S. District
Court were arrested in June 1987 after a three-year FBI undercover
investigation. About 100 people around the country turned over $200
million in drug money to FBI agents posing as money launderers, said
U.S. Attorney Stanley Twardy.
   Restrepo was convicted in November of 66 counts, including
multiple violations of the federal Money Laundering and Travel acts,
racketeering and conspiracy.
   He was found to have moved about $13 million in cocaine proceeds
through a dummy corporation set up by the FBI in Greenwich between
September 1986 and June 1987. Prosecutors also presented evidence
that he laundered about $7 million through operations in Los Angeles
and San Francisco.
   Assistant U.S. Attorneys Richard N. Palmer and James T. Cowdery
told the court that the money laundered by Restrepo would purchase
more than 2{ tons of cocaine in Colombia for sale in the United
States.
   Also Thursday Judge Jose Cabranes sentenced Carlos Gaviria, 31,
of Colombia, to 20 years in prison. Gaviria was a lieutenant in an
enterprise that laundered money for the organization of Rigoberto
Correa, the government said.
   Marco Tulio Lora, 50, and Jorge Gomez, 35, Colombians who had
been living in Miami, received 16-year prison sentences. Prosecutors
said they served as brokers in the money-laundering business.
   Three men described as couriers for Restrepo were sentenced
Wednesday. One received a four-year sentence while the others were
placed on probation.
   Restrepo was the only defendant convicted in Connecticut who did
not plead guilty. His attorney, Vincent Flynn, contended that
Restrepo was an innocent businessman involved in currency exchange.

   The United States evacuated some of its
personnel from the embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, this morning, using a
routine helicopter supply flight to move the workers to Cyprus,
defense officials said.
   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said between 13
and 16 diplomatic workers were withdrawn on Army UH-60 Blackhawk
helicopters, leaving about 25 others still at work at the Beirut
embassy.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman confirmed that some
embassy personnel were evacuated but declined to provide figures.
   ``The recent fighting underscores the urgent need for all
Lebanese to work together to restore legitimate national
institutions,'' he said.
   The helicopters are based on Cyprus to provide logistical support
to the embassy because of the uncertainty of access to the war-torn
nation.
   Redman in recent days has reported the embassy has been caught in
a crossfire due to heavy fighting between rival Christian factions.
According to local police, the fighting earlier this week left 69
people dead and 197 wounded.
   The defense sources said today that a Marine amphibious group is
on a routine deployment in the eastern Mediterranean, but they said
it played no role in the evacuation.
   ``At the request of the State Department, we used a normal
logistical flight to remove some of the embassy people,'' said one
source. ``Everything went as planned.''

<TEXT>
   The commander of the Christian-controlled
army said today the nation faces an ``apocalypse'' if fighting
flares up again between his forces and a rival Christian militia.
   Army leader Gen. Michel Aoun, who also heads the Christian
Cabinet in Lebanon's divided government, told a news conference:
   ``We are responsible for the state, and they want a mini-state
.... Those who do not abide by the law, I'll crush their heads.''
   A cease-fire between the army and the Lebanese Forces militia was
reached Wednesday after fierce clashes earlier in the week around
Christian east Beirut left 69 people dead and 197 wounded, according
to police count.
   The State Department says the U.S. Embassy in Beirut was being
caught in the crossfire, and today some personnel were evacuated.
   Defense officials in Washington, who requested anonymity, said
between 13 and 16 diplomatic workers were withdrawn on Army UH-60
Blackhawk helicopters, leaving about 25 others still at work at the
embassy.
   The helicopters are based on Cyprus to provide logistical support
to the embassy because of the uncertainty of access to the war-torn
nation.
   Aoun said today he accepted the cease-fire mediated by the
Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir and hopes efforts to
reach a peaceful settlement will succeed.
   ``Otherwise, it will be total destruction,'' he said. ``This time
it will be apocalypse,'' he said at his heavily-guarded headquarters
in the Yarze suburb, east of Beirut.
   Aoun demanded the rival Christian force withdraw from east Beirut
and accused it of starting this week's fighting. The battles have
deepened divisions in the Christian community in this nation already
rent by years of civil war between Christians and Moslems, who
control a rival government.
   The army commander said his forces thwarted an attack by the
Lebanese Forces on his home in a wealthy section of east Beirut on
Wednesday. He was away in Yarze at the time.
   During the battles this week, Aoun's army captured militia
positions in Lebanon's central mountains. It also broke through some
militia strongholds in east Beirut, but the militia remained in most
residential districts here.

<HEAD>50 Experts Calculate Mythical Family's Taxes, Give 50 Different Answers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you're still confused about the new federal
tax law, you're in good company. Fifty professionals who advertise
themselves as experts calculated a mythical family's taxes and came
up with 50 different answers.
   Even worse, according to a survey by Money magazine, the experts'
figure for the family's tax bill varied from $12,539 to $35,813. The
correct answer, according to the accountant who devised the test,
was $23,393.
   ``The abundance of mistakes our test turned up suggests that pros
are nowhere near as knowledgeable about the tax law as they are
supposed to be,'' Money writes in its March issue. ``After all, we
were sampling highly regarded preparers who willingly accepted our
challenge to calculate the model return.''
   The experts actually did worse than in a similar Money test a
year ago, when taxpayers were facing effects of the landmark 1986
tax law for the first time.
   In last year's survey, the professionals also came up with 50
different answers but the gap between the highest and lowest was
about 50 percent; this year, the highest was almost 300 percent of
the lowest.
   ``I was completely surprised by the results,'' said Wesley R.
Fitzpatrick of the Portland, Ore., office of Grant Thornton
accountants, who made up this year's test.
   ``When the tax-reform law was new, you could understand the
confusion, but now it's hard to explain all the mistakes about
fundamental rules,'' Fitzpatrick said.
   The hypothetical family's tax return was tackled by 30
independent certified public accountants, 12 representatives of
franchise return-preparation outlets, three CPAs from national
accounting companies and five enrolled agents, who are tested and
licensed by the Internal Revenue Service. Their fees range from $325
to $2,500.
   According to Money, the only preparers who made no major goofs
were five independent CPAs, one enrolled agent, four franchised
preparers and Fitzpatrick, who devised the test.
   For the test, Fitzpatrick conjured up a three-member family whose
tax problems are unlikely to be faced by most taxpayers. However,
Money said, the experts made mistakes on basic tax provisions that
could affect taxpayers at almost any income level.
   For example, the family's 13-year-old son earned $600 mowing
lawns but 16 of the professionals failed to note that he would have
to file a return. Twelve of the experts made the wrong choice on the
tax treatment of inherited U.S. savings bonds, raising the family's
taxes by $3,300.
   The family had salaries of $56,400 but both spouses quit their
jobs during the year and took big lump-sum withdrawals from their
pensions. The wife set up her own business; the husband was
negotiating to buy his own company. The couple had several
investments, owned two homes and inherited a third from the wife's
mother.
   The biggest problem for the experts _ although it had a
relatively minor impact on the family's taxes _ was calculating the
deduction for interest. The 1986 law made major changes on this
deduction.
   Ten preparers were wrong in claiming the husband's mother, who
lived with the family all year, as a dependent. Nineteen experts
claimed three times too much depreciation on equipment used in the
wife's new business.
   However, Money reported, some errors cannot be blamed on the new
law. The magazine said 14 professional preparers made the wrong
calculation on a loss on the sale of stock _ an area of law that
dates back to 1921.
   Money noted that the survey was conducted before much of the
computer software widely used in the business was ready for this
year's returns. With computers, the results would have been better,
the magazine said, although Fitzpatrick said computers would not
have prevented the most common goofs.
   It is not just professional return preparers who are having
trouble with the new law.
   Two weeks ago a survey by the General Accounting Office, an arm
of Congress, found that IRS personnel whose job is to answer
telephoned queries from taxpayers gave the right response to test
questions only 64 percent of the time during the last filing season.

   A fast-moving five-alarm fire gutted a
prominent art gallery, destroying a collection valued by the artist
at more than $1 million and sending off flames that were visible
throughout most of the city.
   No injuries were reported, but about 1,100 people attending a
concert at the Fillmore Auditorium, adjacent to the Duquette
Pavilion of St. Francis, were evacuated, authorities said.
   ``The interior is all gone,'' Assistant Fire Chief Ed Murphy said
at the scene of the blaze.
   The blaze was controlled at 2:44 a.m., more than five hours after
it was reported. Firefighters were still trying to determine its
cause but Fire Chief Fred Postel said it was believed to have
started in a caretaker's apartment in the six- to seven-story
building, formerly a synagogue. Arson investigator Al Silvestri said
there was nothing suspicious about the fire.
   ``There were flames like I've never seen before,'' said Eddie
Seymour, 18, who lives a few blocks from the gallery, which features
the work of artist and owner Tony Duquette. The fire was visible
from most of the city and acrid smoke blanketed the Western Addition
district and surrounding neighborhoods.
   Buildings adjacent to the gallery, including the famous Fillmore
and the former Peoples Temple run by the Rev. Jim Jones, were not
damaged by flames but may have suffered water damage, Postel said.
   About 140 firefighters battled the fire, which quickly climbed to
the roof of the stately buff brick building. Postel said the
structure's large open interior space and wooden ceiling supported
by trusses instead of columns made it difficult to fight the blaze.
   A shaken Duquette watched as firefighters directed cascades of
water into the building through the shattered stained glass window
and the remains of a metal starburst sculpture that partly covered
it.
   The artist said the collection was valued at more than more $1
million but was too distraught to provide other details. The
collection, which had been featured in Time and other publications,
included tapestries and sculptures, much of it dedicated to St.
Francis of Assisi, the saint for whom San Francisco is named.

   About two dozen toilets and urinals in the King
County Courthouse exploded when they were flushed because an air
compressor had been erroneously connected to a water line, officials
said.
   ``We think we've lost about 20 to 25 toilets,'' said building
services manager Bill Kemp. ``The porcelain is actually cracked.''
   ``We knew it had to be air in the system, but the (city) Water
Department said that was impossible,'' Kemp said.
   Officials eventually traced Thursday's problem in the 72-year-old
building to an compressor hooked up by a construction worker at a
nearby $430 million bus tunnel project.
   Kemp said no injuries were reported, although several people
apparently were soaked.
   All courthouse restrooms were closed for the rest of the day, and
people had to cross the street to toilets in the county
Administration Building. Damages had not yet been determined.

<TEXT>
   With less than a week to go before the state funeral
of Emperor Hirohito, riot police already have taken up positions
along the procession route from the Imperial Palace to the Shinjuku
Imperial Gardens.
   Other preparations for the Feb. 24 funeral are entering the final
stages.
   Bulldozers, cranes and construction workers have clearly left
their mark on the normally serene, parklike grounds of the gardens,
where the funeral will be held.
   A main funeral hall with a curved roof in the traditional style
of Japan's indigenous religion has been built, along with a
reception area for mourners and a prefabricated shelter for the
media.
   Dominating the gardens are two white tents more than 330 feet
long where the imperial family, government leaders, foreign
dignitaries and other guests will be seated.
   Foreign Ministry officials, who gave foreign reporters their
first look at the site Friday, said 5,000 people will be seated in
each tent. Guests unable to see the main hall will be able to view
the proceedings on seven high-definition TV screens.
   Representatives of 154 nations are expected to attend. Among the
dignitaries will be President Bush, Philippine President Corazon
Aquino, Britain's Prince Philip and French President Francois
Mitterrand.
   Foreign Ministry officials have been overwhelmed by more than
1,000 foreign journalists seeking credentials.
   Security at the gardens is tight, with armored police vehicles
and road blocks securing entrances. Officers scan the surrounding
area from perches atop a large greenhouse.
   Since Hirohito's death from cancer on Jan. 7, his body has lain
in state at the main ceremonial hall of the palace.
   Riot police, sometimes stationed only hundreds of yards apart,
have begun a 24-hour watch on the four-mile route along which the
emperor's body will travel from the palace to the gardens.
   The 40-minute procession route winds through mostly business and
government districts, passing by the Parliament and Supreme Court
buildings. Several facilities built for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics also
are along the way.
   Clad in dark blue helmets and uniforms and wielding silver
shields and nightsticks, the thousands of riot police along downtown
streets are the most conspicuous evidence of the government's
determination to maintain security.
   A high-ranking official with the National Police Agency said,
``The situation requires security on an unprecedented scale.''
   The government has $19 million to security, a quarter of the
funeral budget. Police will undertake random searches of vehicles in
areas around the gardens and palace, and check and reseal manholes.
   Frogmen will patrol the waters around one of the airports where
dignitaries will arrive.
   The police official said about 26,000 police had been assigned to
funeral security and that would be increased to 32,000 on the day of
the funeral. There are about 220,000 police in Japan.
   Security requirements have forced police to bring in officers
from all over the country, but the official said 10,000 areas
designated as possible terrorist targets are being given
``sufficient attention.''
   ``We may suffer a blow, but not a knockout,'' he said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Newspapers have kept readers updated on what to expect when the
day arrives, running reports on everything on traffic to the 253
temporary toilets along the funeral procession route.

<TEXT>
   The Air Force's powerful new Titan 4
rocket will carry a huge new missile-warning satellite when it
blasts off on its maiden flight next month, an industry magazine
reported Friday.
   Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology said the 5,200-pound satellite
is the third generation of Defense Support Program payloads designed
to give the United States instant alert of a missile attack.
   The magazine said in a report to be published in its Feb. 20
issue that nine of the new DSP satellites, costing $180 million
each, will be launched over the next several years.
   It said the satellite has an advanced infrared telescope to
detect the heat exhaust of a missile rising after launch from land
or sea.
   While missile warning is the payload's primary role, Aviation
Week said the satellite also will provide intelligence on routine
Soviet and Chinese missile test firings and space launches.
   It also is expected to be able to detect the heat from military
aircraft when they fly with their afterburners on for higher speed.
   The magazine said the satellite has new survivability features,
including a system to protect it from ground-based lasers.
   Thirteen early model DSP satellites have been launched by the Air
Force since 1971.
   The Titan 4, the largest of three rocket systems the Air Force
ordered to lessen its dependency on NASA's space shuttle after the
1986 Challenger explosion, is scheduled for launch in mid-March.

   The poet said music can soothe the savage breast,
but music, literature, painting and sculpture also can stir man's
animal passions. While the death threats against novelist Salman
Rushdie are unique, other artists have been subject to mass hysteria
through the years. Here is a report.

   In the Middle Ages, artists were called blasphemers
for making pictures of God's works. Music has incited brawls, plays
have caused  Moslem patriarch has put a price on a
writer's head.
   Todariots, and now ay, Salman Rushdie is in hiding, condemned by Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The
Satanic Verses.'' Khomeini commanded his followers to kill Rushdie
and has offered millions to the one who does.
   ``It has no parallel in this century and it hasn't happened in
Europe for a very long time,'' said Andrew Causey, an art historian
at Manchester University.
   ``We have had horrific anti-Semitism in our time, but not since
the Inquisition, or the French religious wars or the
Counter-Reformation 400 years ago, has a religion threatened anyone
across national boundaries and on another continent,'' he said.
   As passion drives artists, their works often arouse passions in
those h-style depictions of the human
figure. Causey said that created ``an atmosphere in which Epstein,
perversely, seemed to flourish.''
   ``Rima,'' the sculptor's memorial to the writer W.H. Hudson, was
unveiled in Hyde Park in 1929 to savage comment by critics and some
fellow artists. Drunken students and fascists vandalized it.
   Word got out in 1830 that Victor Hugo's verse drama ``Hernani''
broke all the rules of classical theater. The ``Battle of Hernani''
followed.
   Traditionalists in the orchestra section at the Comedie Francaise
were outshouted by young Hugo admirers in the cheap seats. It all
helped assure the success of the romantic movement in the arts.
   John Millington Synge's ``The Playboy of the Western World''
provoked Irish patriots to riot at Dublin's Abbey Theater in 1907.
   They did not like its bitter humor and portrayal of the Irish as
buffoons and bumpkins. The poet William Butler Yeats took the stage
to defend it with equal passion.
   Irish nationalists demonstrated again at the play's New York
premiere in 1911. In Philadelphia, the entire cast was imprisoned on
an obscenity charge.
   Sean O'Casey's ``The Plough and the Stars'' also caused riots at
the Abbey with its unheroic treatment of the 1916 Easter Rising.
   A copy of Alfred Hitchcock's film of O'Casey's ``Juno and the
Paycock'' was burned in 1930 on the streets of Limerick for its
depiction of Dublin tenement life.
   Sir Alfred Munnings, the painter and president of Britain's
august Royal Academy of Arts, provoked uproar in 1949 by telling an
audience Sir Winston Churchill had said to him: ``If we met Picasso
or Matisse we'd give them a running kick, wouldn't we?''
   British artists and critics sent apologies to the two artists in
France.
   ``Wherever books are burned, men also, in the end, are burned,''
the 19th century German poet Heinrich Heine wrote prophetically. A
century later, in the 1930s, Hitler's Nazis publicly burned the
books they dislike, then plunged the world into war and killed 6
million Jews.
   Richard Wagner, a virulent anti-Semite, was one of Hitler's
favorite composers. The Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra performed
music by Wagner at a Tel Aviv concert in 1981 and the audience
erupted into shouting and fistfights.
   Saudi Arabia expelled Britain's ambassador in 1980 because of the
British television film, ``Death of a Princess,'' which recreated
scenes of a Saudi princess and her lover being executed. The film
was shown and the British government apologized.
   J. Selby Whittingham, an independent art historian, told The
Associated Press: ``From time to time, there is an intense focus on
one incident ... and everything gets out of proportion.''
   ``In the case of the arts, it's partly due to people not
understanding what annoys them. They cannot comprehend the
standpoint of the artist, and feel threatened by the unknown or the
unexplained or the startlingly new.''

<TEXT>
   A $21.75 million jury award to Rock Hudson's
lover is ``clearly excessive'' and ``catastrophic,'' critics said,
but others praised the verdict for sending a message about
responsibility to those with AIDS.
   Some lawyers were aghast at the size of the award to Marc
Christian, and one homosexual rights activist said he was concerned
that the decision would wrongly free lovers of their responsibility
to protect themselves against AIDS.
   Christian was Hudson's homosexual lover before the actor died of
AIDS on Oct. 5, 1985. Christian sued Hudson's estate and personal
secretary, Mark Miller, saying they had caused him emotional anguish
by failing to warn him that Hudson had the fatal disease.
   Jurors found Hudson and Miller engaged in ``outrageous conduct''
by failing to tell Christian of Hudson's diagnosis.
   Benjamin Schatz, a lawyer for National Gay Rights Advocates in
San Francisco, said the case ``sends a dangerous message. It tells
people that if they continue to bury their heads in the sand by
engaging in unsafe sex and become infected, it's entirely their
partner's fault and they don't bear any responsibility.''
   ``While we understand the jury's sympathy for the plaintiff, the
precedent their award establishes is catastrophic,'' said Frank
Schubert, president of the Association for California Tort Reform.
``What the jury's done is award damages for fear, whether it's
rational fear or not.''
   Christian consistently has tested negative for infection with the
AIDS virus. His lawyer said that's no guarantee he won't eventually
develop AIDS because of his sexual liaisons with Hudson.
   Under California law, the issue is irrelevant, said attorney
Margaret Davis, author of ``Lovers, Doctors &amp; the Law,'' and Tom
Coleman, legal director for the Gay and Lesbian Community Services
Center in Los Angeles.
   ``In (many) other jurisdictions, you have to show physical injury
as well as emotional injury,'' Ms. Davis said. ``In California, if
you can prove ... emotional distress, you do not have to prove a
tangible injury.''
   Coleman said the jury was right to side with Christian, but
added: ``The damages seem a bit high ... when you compare it with
someone who may be paralyzed for life and may get a lot less money.''
   Ms. Davis said the ``larger-than-anticipated'' award ``sends a
really serious symbolic message to all lovers. The person who is
going to mislead a sexual partner is really going to think twice
before they tell a lie.''
   Schatz said he was concerned that the case ``opens the door to a
variety of spurious lawsuits'' by angry lovers.
   Dr. Neil Schram, a member of the California Medical Association's
AIDS task force, called the award ``clearly excessive'' since
Christian apparently wasn't infected, and put the blame for Hudson's
actions on society.
   ``Rock Hudson was required all his life to be sexually dishonest
in order to be successful,'' Schatz said. ``He had to remain in the
closet. As long as society continues to tell people to hate
themselves for their sexuality, then it's hard to expect them to
respect their sexual partners and be honest.''

<TEXT>
   In the heart of Paris, home of fantastic foie gras
and sublime sauces, Americans can satisfy an urge for pumpkin pie,
peanut butter, creamed corn and even Cheerios.
   But The General Store is more than just a kitchen away from home
for expatriates.
   Its operators, Jean-Pierre and Elaine Bourbeillon, say it is
increasingly popular with the French, who are developing a taste for
American food.
   Bourbeillon is French and his wife is from New Zealand, but they
know a lot about cranberry sauce, chocolate chip cookies, taco
shells and molasses.
   They got hooked on American fare when Jean-Pierre was a
commodities trader in the United States from 1976 to 1984.
   ``The European idea of American food is built on preconceived
notions and prejudices, mostly developed from lack of knowledge and
being exposed to the fast-food craze,'' Bourbeillon, 46, said
recently as he served customers. ``There is more to American food
than burgers and hot dogs.''
   When the Bourbeillons returned to France from Boston, they made a
list of foods, ``a good representative idea of what America has to
offer, regional products like maple syrup and clam chowder from the
Northeast and Tex-Mex from the Southwest,'' he said.
   They opened the store three years ago, and their clientele is
split evenly between Americans and the French.
   ``There has always been a love-hate relationship with the United
States. The French have always had a tremendous fascination with
anything American,'' Bourbeillon said.
   A French woman, Francoise Roger, entered the store on a narrow
Left Bank street for a look around, and bought a bottle of bleu
cheese salad dressing and a jar of blueberry chutney.
   ``I'm curious about the tastes of other countries,'' she said.
``Today, I'm concentrating on typical American tastes. I'm here
looking for sauces.''
   Many customers come for the fresh brownies, cookies and pies
Elaine bakes daily.
   ``In the beginning, we got a lot of press like we were some
oddball operation, selling California wine to the French,''
Bourbeillon said. ``But the French have moved from a kind of amused
interest to a genuine liking for American food.
   ``And there are other trends. The French are taking to brunches
and are starting to like making pancakes, or having a chili dinner
for 20. It's becoming an accepted thing to do, at least in Paris.''
   Said Mrs. Bourbeillon: ``It is a change in attitude and a new way
of life. I don't think it's a passing trend. It is an evolution.''
   The General Store is busiest at Thanksgiving.
   ``Last year we discovered we were becoming famous,'' Mrs.
Bourbeillon said. ``The year before we did turkey for the first
time, with all the fixings, plus pastry, pumpkin and pecan pies.
This year we produced literally hundreds'' of meals.
   Demand was so great that they joined forces with a poultry dealer
down the street. Mrs. Bourbeillon furnished a sage stuffing recipe
and a neighbor cooked the turkeys while she baked the pies.
   ``He kept running up here with pans of it for tasting sessions,''
she said.
   ``For the French we had to tell them what to do with the yams and
cranberry sauce. We gave out little recipes. It was a lot of fun,''
she said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First lady Barbara Bush swayed, sang and won
legions of young fans Friday as she participated in an elementary
school assembly celebrating Black History Month.
   ``When I get home I'm going to scream and tell my mommy,'' said
Bernice Graham, 8, a glee club member at Scott Montgomery Elementary
School.
   ``We liked her very much. We want her to come back,'' said Monica
Osgood, 10. ``We hope she'll come back again with President Bush.''
   Montgomery, serving a low-income neighborhood dotted with
dilapidated houses, empty lots and convenience stores, is part of a
matching grant enrichment program for needy schools sponsored by the
private Washington Parent Group Fund. Mrs. Bush has belonged to the
group for six years.
   ``We know you are our friend,'' school principal Harriette
Freeman told Mrs. Bush, citing her service in the parent group
``long before you became Mrs. President. We are honored and we hope
you will return to our school many times.''
   Added the principal: ``For 11 years I have told the boys and
girls that what they do will someday be seen and heard around the
world. This is the beginning.''
   Mrs. Bush's visit to the school was kept secret until right
before the assembly. Students were not told in advance in order to
keep scores of parents and neighbors from cramming the small
auditorium and also ``to cut down on the tension,'' said glee club
director Frances Ball.
   The first lady, dressed in her trademark royal blue and triple
strand of pearls, drew cheers and a standing ovation from the 500
students as she entered the auditorium.
   From a third-row seat between two little girls, she watched
attentively as students using a white wig, a cane, a stethoscope, a
lab coat and a cleric's robe discuss the contributions of black
Americans ranging from Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass to
George Washington Carver and Jesse Jackson.
   Milton Law brought down the house with a ringing excerpt from
Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have a Dream'' speech. Other parts of
the program featured poetry, an autoharp rendition of Scott Joplin's
``Entertainer'' rag, a dance to the song ``A Change is Going To
Come,'' and two spirituals performed by the school glee club.
   Kindergarten student Kevin McGriff, speaking in a nervous
monotone, asked Mrs. Bush to come up to the stage and presented her
with gifts _ a book by children involved in the ``Writing to Read''
program and a bright green T-shirt, bookbag and pencils with the
school's name.
   Mrs. Bush held the T-shirt up to her chest and complimented all
of the performers, then gave Kevin a book for the school library _
``People Could Fly, An American Black Folk Tale.''
   ``If you work hard, if you try very hard, all of us can fly,''
said the first lady, a longtime advocate of literacy programs such
as ``Writing to Read.''
   At the end of the assembly, Mrs. Bush remained onstage and sang
six verses of ``We Shall Overcome,'' holding hands and swaying with
members of the glee club beneath a sign that said ``Believe It ...
Achieve It.'' As she left she shook some outstretched hands and
waved to others.

   The federal government authorized an
attempt Friday to rescue a bottlenose dolphin from the chilly waters
of Broad Bay because the young mammal has been losing weight,
officials said.
   A seven-member team from Sea World in Orlando, Fla., planned to
try to trap the dolphin in a net during low tide and move it by
truck or plane to Sea World for rehabilitation.
   ``This is for the animal's best health and welfare at this
time,'' said Douglas Beach, a biologist with the National Marine
Fisheries Service. ``He may well be able to survive the rest of the
winter, I don't know. But our fear is that he may not and we may
have a real sick dolphin on our hands at a later date.''
   The service decided the animal, nicknamed Rascal, should be
rescued before it develops pneumonia or other ailments, he said.
   The dolphin, which weighs about 250 pounds and is about 6 feet
long, stayed in Broad Bay months after other dolphins migrated
south. The animal eluded rescue efforts in December.
   Jack Pearson, curator of mammals at Sea World, said he expected
the dolphin would be easier to capture now because it has become
familiar with humans who have visited daily to check on its
condition.

   The nation's largest bookseller, Waldenbooks, ordered ``The
Satanic Verses'' off store shelves for fear that threats of violence
against the book's author and publisher might extend to its
employees.
   But the book was missing from many bookstore shelves today for
another reason: Sales were booming.
   ``This is not a freedom of speech issue _ the sole reason is the
protection of our employees,'' Bonnie Predd, executive vice
president of Waldenbooks, said after the chain ordered its copies
removed from display Thursday.
   ``Waldenbooks has fought long and hard against censorship, but
when it comes to the safety of Waldenbooks employees and our
customers, we must act responsibly in their interests,'' said a
statement read today by Grace Castricone of Waldenbooks' marketing
department.
   Telephone calls by The Associated Press to Waldenbooks stores
nationwide Thursday night found that the Salman Rushdie novel _
which provoked the Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to
call for the author's death _ was available for sale on request in a
few stores, but was not on display.
   Employees answering the telephone at most stores said they had
been instructed by corporate headquarters to say ``No comment'' to
any questions about the book.
   A woman in the president's office at Stamford, Conn.-based
Waldenbooks said today that the decision to pull the book from
public display was made Wednesday night ``when our store managers
received some threats.''
   The woman said she wouldn't give her name, adding, ``Everybody
here is concerned about their safety.''
   In Forestville, Md., a Waldenbooks store reported receiving a
telephone bomb threat from an unidentified man who wanted it to stop
selling the book, authorities said.
   The threat was made against the Waldenbooks at Landover Mall on
Thursday, said Prince George's County police spokesman Chuck Cook.
The store received the call from a man with a foreign accent who
said a bomb would be detonated later that day if the store didn't
pull the book from its shelves. But store officials said they never
had the novel in stock.
   Other bookstores said they couldn't keep up with demand for ``The
Satanic Verses,'' which was selling poorly before the death threat.
   ``We had a display of it for three weeks and it just sat there,''
said Carolyn Fenton, manager of Bookstop in Alamo Heights, a suburb
of San Antonio, Texas. ``I can't remember selling one off it. Then,
like that, they were gone.''
   Brian Weese, general manager of Encore Books, a Harrisburg,
Pa.-based chain of 47 stores in the Middle Atlantic States, said
several of his outlets have sold out their allotment.
   ``The fist-shaking is happening elsewhere, thank God,'' Weese
said. ``The ironic thing is that it's working against what Khomeini
and others want to accomplish. It's piqued everyone's interest and
sparked the sales, rather than forcing people to remove it and not
sell it.''
   Seven people died this week in Pakistan and northern India during
riotous protests against the book, which some Moslems say blasphemes
the prophet Mohammed. The book has been banned in several countries
with mostly Moslem populations.
   Today was to be the start of an 11-city promotional tour of the
United States by Rushdie, but the book's U.S. publisher, Viking
Penguin Inc., canceled the tour because of the threats. Rushdie, 41,
of Great Britain, was reported to be in hiding.
   Viking Penguin executives were wearing bulletproof vests at the
office, the Daily News in New York reported today, citing
unidentified sources. And Thursday the company received its ninth
bomb threat since December. Workers were sent home and told to stay
there today, too.
   The novel, published in Britain in September, has been available
in the United States for several weeks.
   About 10,000 copies of the book were distributed to Waldenbooks
stores in 660 cities nationwide, Predd said. A memorandum authorized
by Harry Hoffman, president of the company, was sent to all the
stores ordering the book off the shelves, she said.
   Viking Penguin began a second printing of the book last week,
according to a company spokesman. The first run was 50,000 copies.
   ``We're printing to meet demand,'' the spokesman said Thursday.
He asked that his name not be used, citing the bomb threats at the
company's New York headquarters.
   He said the $19.95 hardcover has hit four regional best-seller
lists _ in this week's Chicago Tribune and The Boston Globe and next
week's San Francisco Chronicle and The Washington Post.
   A fast-selling book usually gets special treatment from retailers
_ window displays, a separate table or a prominent place on shelves.
Some booksellers said the uproar wouldn't deter them.
   ``No book should be banned from sale for the ideas it contains,''
said Michael Bills, manager of The Harvard Book Store in Cambridge,
Mass. He said an unidentified group called him Tuesday to urge that
an ``offensive'' Rushdie display be removed from the shop window,
but he refused.
   Of five large midtown Manhattan bookstores, only a Barnes &amp; Noble
outlet on Fifth Avenue had copies left Thursday.
   ``I don't have it in the window, but I have it prominently
displayed on both floors,'' said Alex Ostrowsky, the store's
assistant manager. ``There's some concern, but it's not stopping any
kind of merchandising.''
   Norma Carmona, manager of the Classic Book Shop a block away,
said she scrounged up 15 copies of the book Wednesday morning but
they were sold in hours.
   ``Everybody's talking about it, everyone wants to read it,'' she
said.

   A stockbroker sought after allegedly disappearing
with millions of dollars of his client's funds was arrested today by
customs agents in Massena, N.Y., the U.S. Customs Service said.
   Walter F. Curran was trying to enter the United States from
Montreal after showing officers his Massachusetts drivers license. A
computer search showed a warrant had been issued for his arrest,
customs spokesman Edward Callanan said.
   Curran was discovered missing, along with a reported $8 million,
early this week after clients stormed the Boston office of
investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., claiming he had been
privately handling their money. A federal warrant was issued for his
arrest earlier this week.
   A search of Curran's rental car discovered $130,000 in unreported
cash, a violation of federal law, Callanan said.
   Curran will be charged with violating the currency law, Callanan
said.

   The Navy will pay $1 million
to repair the USS Spruance, a destroyer that ran aground on a coral
reef in the Bahamas last month, officials said.
   Repairs began this week at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula,
Miss., and should be completed this month, said Ray Sykes, a Navy
spokesman in Pascagoula.
   The ship's propellers and propeller hubs will be repaired, as
well as the mast, which was damaged due to windy weather and high
seas during the grounding, Sykes said.
   The ship ran aground Jan. 25 about three miles east of Andros
Island, the largest island in the Bahamas, during a four-day
training exercise at the Navy's Atlantic Undersea Test and
Evaluation Center.
   The destroyer, based at Mayport, was refloated three days later
and towed to Pascagoula.
   Navy officials have said they will not discuss how the Spruance
was grounded until an investigation is completed. But based on
preliminary findings, Cmdr. Travis W. Parker Jr. was relieved as the
Spruance's commander and reassigned.

   A woman who left two children home alone
has been arrested for alleged child neglect after her 5-year-old son
died in a fire believed to have been started by his younger brother.
   Authorities spent hours after the fire Thursday searching for the
mother, Minnie Van, 35, and found her at her brother's house, said
Deputy Police Chief Don Mitchell. She was jailed in lieu of $1,000
bond on charges of endangering a child and child neglect.
   Isaac Van, 5, and his 4-year-old brother Willie were alone at
home when the fire started, police said. Three others were in
school, and one other was with Ms. Van, police said.
   Willie told police he started the fire by lighting papers on a
bed, said Public Safety Driector Pat Ward. The boy was rescued by a
passerby.
   One of Ms. Van's daughters said her mother had left the house to
get medical attention for her youngest child, a 1{-year-old girl,
Ward said.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Say Alcohol Labeling Rules Too Lax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer groups say temporary regulations
governing the size and placement of warning labels to be printed on
alcoholic beverage containers are too lax to ensure that people will
notice them.
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on Thursday
published the rules on the warning labels, which Congress last year
voted to require on alcoholic beverages sold in the United States
starting next November.
   The regulations say the print in the labels must be at least 2
millimeters high for containers larger than 8 ounces, and at least 1
millimeter for smaller containers. The warnings must be placed on
the brand label, a separate front label or on a back or side label.
   Patricia Taylor, of the private, non-profit Center for Science in
the Public Interest, said the regulations serve ``the interests of
the booze industry _ not the public.''
   ``It's ridiculous to allow companies who fought labeling
requirements for the past 20 years to print labels in tiny script
any which way on the back or side of a bottle,'' she said.
   Christine Lubinski of the National Council on Alcoholism said the
bureau had ``missed another opportunity to promote the public's
health.''
   The public has 45 days to comment on the temporary regulations,
after which final rules will be published.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who sponsored the labeling
requirement in Congress, said, ``if the final regulations allow
industry members to place minuscule labels in difficult-to-find
places on the containers, the purpose of the law has been defeated.''
   The labels warn that women should not drink alcoholic beverages
during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects, and caution
that drinking alcoholic beverages impairs the ability to drive a car
or operate machinery and can cause health problems.

<TEXT>
   A jury today awarded $7.25 million in
additional damages to Rock Hudson's lover, who had already received
an award of $14.5 million because the movie star failed to reveal he
had AIDS.
   The jury's decision on punitive and exemplary damages found that
Hudson's secretary and confidant, Mark Miller, acted ``with malice''
and intended to cause injury to Marc Christian when he failed to
tell Christian that Hudson had the deadly disease.
   ``If Rock Hudson had told me he had AIDS, none of us would be
here today,'' Christian said as he left the courtroom. Christian has
not been diagnosed with AIDS.
   He said he believes that times have changed and gay men do not
now keep the kind of secrets that Hudson kept from him.
   ``This is 1989 and everybody has to take precautions for
themselves,'' he said. ``I hope that no one will be as naive as I
was in 1983.''
   Miller's attorney, Andrew Banks, called the size of the award
``outrageous'' and said he would file a motion to have it thrown out
or reduced. He said it was ``a good bet'' he would appeal.
   Some legal experts denounced the $14.5 million in compensatory
damages _ $3.5 million more than the lawsuit asked for _ as
excessive, but a lawyer for Christian had urged jurors Thursday to
add another $14.5 million to the judgment in punitive and exemplary
damages. The jury today awarded him half of that amount, for a total
of $21.75 million.
   The jury answered three questions in its verdict, all of them
``yes.'' The questions asked whether they found that Miller intended
to injure Christian, that he acted with a ``willful and conscious''
disregard for Christian's safety and whether Miller's fraudulent
conduct deprived Christian of a legal right or any other injury.
   The jury decided Wednesday that Hudson and Miller were guilty of
``outrageous conduct'' by deliberately hiding Hudson's AIDS
diagnosis from Christian while Hudson and Christian continued to
have unprotected sex.
   The jury returned Thursday to begin the next phase in the
two-month trial: Christian's request for punitive and exemplary
damages from Miller. Only Miller is named because state law
prohibits such damages being awarded from an estate.
   ``You have the opportunity to save the lives of untold millions.
You must surely be blessed,'' Christian's lawyer, Harold Rhoden,
told the jury.
   But Banks, Miller's attorney, told jurors to be cautious and ``go
slowly'' in deciding.
   Banks urged the panel not to vent anger at Hudson by penalizing
Miller, 63, the secretary who also served as Hudson's friend and
confidante for 35 years.
   ``He's not the person who had sex with Marc Christian,'' Banks
said. ``If you're angry at Rock Hudson, I ask you to set all the
feelings about Rock Hudson aside and consider Mark Miller. There is
no need to hit Mark Miller again.''
   Christian, 35, said he didn't find out about Hudson's disease
until it was announced to the world in July 1985. Hudson died three
months later at age 58.
   Christian sued the Hudson estate and Miller for $11 million,
claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress and an
``enhanced fear'' that he too will die of AIDS.
   Those who disagreed with the jury's decision to award Christian
$3.5 million more than he had asked for said it could set a
dangerous precedent.
   ``I'm delighted with the message and I'm appalled at the size of
the award,'' said Rabbi Allen Freehling, chairman of the Los Angeles
County Commission on AIDS.
   Frank Schubert, president of the Association for California Tort
Reform, called the verdict an ``awful decision.''
   ``While we understand the jury's sympathy for the plaintiff, the
precedent their award establishes is catastrophic,'' Schubert said.
``They've awarded for an injury that hasn't yet occurred. ... What
the jury's done is award damages for fear, whether it's rational
fear or not.''
   Rhoden told jurors that doubling the damages would send a message
to the world that lovers can't keep secrets about AIDS without
risking legal consequences.
   ``If you bring in a verdict like the one you brought in
yesterday, you know the world is going to know about it,'' he told
the jury.
   Miller's lawyer countered that the message already was sent.
   ``It's echoed around the world,'' Banks said. ``Now please
exercise caution.''

   Japanese balloonist Fumio Niwa is giving up his
attempt to cross the Pacific Ocean alone because of uncooperative
winds, and he plans to bring his craft down on the sea, officials
said Friday.
   Project spokesman Ren Kato said an airplane would determine
Niwa's location early Saturday, and that Niwa then planned to bring
his giant orange-and-blue balloon down to wait for a ship to pick
him up.
   Niwa lifted off early Wednesday from his hometown of Yokohama
with the goal of becoming the first person to travel 5,000 miles
across the ocean alone in a balloon.
   But the flight was frustrated from the start by winds that blew
to the north rather than to California, where Niwa had hoped to land
on Sunday.
   On Friday, his craft floated 4.4 miles above the Pacific about
1,450 miles southeast of Tokyo, Kato said.
   Kato said waves in the area were estimated at 20 feet in height,
and that Niwa might not be able to bring down the craft until they
subsided. Although the six-foot plastic gondola carrying Niwa can
float, high waves would batter it and possibly hide it from
rescuers, Kato said.
   Japanese marine officials said no boats were in the area and that
a coast guard ship would not arrive until Sunday night.
   If the high waves did subside and Niwa brought down the balloon,
he could be left bobbing in the ocean for more than a day.
   ``He should be able to survive for an extended period, but the
gondola will rock a great deal,'' Kato said. ``He's likely to become
very seasick.''
   Niwa, an experienced balloonist, had hoped to travel to San Diego
in about four days with the help of high-speed, high-altitude winds
that generally blow west to east.
   But after the launch, the winds shifted north toward Alaska. Niwa
stayed at a low altitude initially in an attempt to travel south and
then catch the southernmost edge of the jet stream, which might have
landed him farther south in North America.
   He then jettisoned most of his ballast and rose in altitude, but
missed the high-speed winds, said Hiroaki Tanaka, another project
spokesman.
   ``The loss of the ballast means he no longer is able to maneuver
up and down to find a good wind,'' Tanaka said.
   Niwa, 38, quit his job with a computer firm three months ago to
prepare for the flight. He estimated the flight would cost about
$540,000, a sum he hoped to recoup through a book and lectures about
his experience.
   In 1981, four men successfully crossed the Pacific Ocean by
balloon for the first time, but no one has traveled the distance
alone.

   Authorities on Friday lifted a curfew
called to quell ethnic violence after national elections gave the
party of President Ranasinghe Premadasa another majority in
Parliament.
   Thousands of workers crowded the streets of Colombo, the capital,
on their way to work Friday after the curfew ended at 5 a.m. It was
called Thursday morning to forestall ethnic attacks during
vote-counting from Wednesday's elections.
   Military officials said there had been no reports of major
trouble during the curfew, which confined most people to their homes.
   At least 56 people were killed on election day. During the
five-week campaign, more than 1,000 people were killed by Sinhalese
extremists and Tamil separatists, police said. Both groups had vowed
to disrupt the elections.
   Despite attacks and death threats, 63 percent of 9.3 million
eligible voters turned out.
   Premadasa, whose United National Party won 125 of the 225
Parliament seats, called his election victory a ``decisive mandate''
for restoring law and order on this island off the southern tip of
India.
   However, Premadasa failed to gain the two-thirds majority he
wanted to ensure passage of legislation to implement his
anti-poverty program, which he considers a key element in ending the
bloodshed.
   The minority Tamil rebels opposed the elections because they are
fighting the Sinhalese-dominated government for a homeland. Their
struggle has created a backlash among Sinhalese extremists, who say
the government has given too much to the Tamils.
   Sinhalese account for 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people
and dominate the government and military. Tamils, who make up 18
percent, say they suffer discrimination in jobs and education.

   Peter O'Toole says he doesn't think he has
changed much since ``Lawrence of Arabia'' made him an overnight star
in 1962.
   ``My hair is a slightly different color,'' the 56-year-old actor
says in an interview in the March 6 issue of Us magazine. ``People
who haven't seen me for a long time tell me I haven't changed
physically.
   ``And inside I don't feel any different from when I was quite a
young fellow.''
   O'Toole said he has no regrets about the ups and downs in his
life, not even his drinking days.
   ``I wouldn't have missed one drop of alcohol that I drank,'' he
said, noting that most of his drinking buddies _ Richard Burton,
Peter Finch and Robert Shaw _ are dead.
   ``The risks we took, the life we led. Sadly that's all over,'' he
said. ``My health was affected, and there came a point when it was
actually more difficult to go on drinking than to give it up.''

   Baseball legend Leo ``The Lip''
Durocher remained in serious but stable condition Friday, recovering
from injuries suffered in a traffic accident.
   Durocher, 83, a fiery manager who led three New York teams to the
World Series, suffered head lacerations Wednesday when his car
struck another vehicle that turned in front of him, said Detective
Terry Robinson. The other driver, not identified, also was injured.
   Susan Pond, a nursing supervisor at Desert Hospital, described
Durocher's injuries as serious but said his condition had
stabilized. She would not elaborate.
   Durocher figured prominently as a manager and player from the
1920s to the 1970s, earning the nickname ``Leo the Lip'' for his
umpire-baiting personality and scrappy style of play. He titled his
autobiography ``Nice Guys Finish Last.''

   The Iran-Contra trial of Oliver North has been
set to begin Tuesday morning, officials at the U.S. Courthouse said
today.
   Problems have been worked out over the use of classified material
that North wants to introduce in his defense, and U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell is telling the jury to report at 9:30 a.m.
Tuesday, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A jury of nine women and three men was chosen Feb. 9, the same
day the Justice Department began trying to delay the trial. The
department lifted its objections on Wednesday after receiving
assurances from independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, whose office is
prosecuting North, that classified material would be protected.
   A stay of the trial granted last Sunday by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist was vacated Thursday.
   Meanwhile today, a closed-door courtroom fight continued over how
the Reagan administration's quid pro quo arrangements with third
countries to provide aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels are to be
presented at North's trial.
   North's lawyers say the government is refusing to admit that
President Reagan and other top administration officials hid a policy
of offering inducements to third countries for their support of the
Contras.
   In a court filing Wednesday that was made public today, North's
attorneys said Walsh ``fails _ for the fourth time _ to
acknowledge'' that Reagan and other officials established a policy
that ``the quid pro quo and other third-country arrangements would
not be disclosed.''
   The filing by lawyers Brendan Sullivan and Barry Simon reflects
the courtroom fight that was continuing today behind closed doors as
North's lawyers push for greater disclosures of arrangements which
they have called the heart of the case.
   Gesell has said he will accept an admission of fact from the
government on the arrangements rather than allowing North's lawyers
to present the matter in detail in open court. The issue involves
substantial amounts of classified material.
   In its proposed admission, the government on Tuesday suggested
that ``North alone was responsible for devising a means of
concealing a quid pro quo arrangement from Congress,'' North's
lawyers said. They said the independent counsel's proposed
submission on that point ``is grossly misleading and patently
inadequate.''
   ``If the defense must be satisfied with a cold admission on the
quid pro quo issue _ and must give up its right to present the many
documents and the extensive live testimony that would bring the
issue to life for the jury _ then it must also have an admission on
the non-disclosure policy,'' said North's lawyers.
   They insisted that information be included ``setting forth
particular instances in which executive branch officials withheld
information concerning quid pro quo and other third-country
arrangements.''
   North's attorneys also said they want to supplement the
government's admission with specifics of inducements the United
States offered third countries to persuade them to support the
Contras.
   They also saidthe names of the Central American countries
involved in the arrangements must be disclosed at trial.
   North's lawyers are opposing a plan in which Walsh would notify
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh any time particularly sensitive
classified material is about to be disclosed.
   The defense says the procedure ``would impose intolerable burdens
on the court, the witnesses and the jurors.''
   On Tuesday, Gesell ordered Thornburgh to stay out of the
Iran-Contra case, saying it was up to Walsh to prevent the
introduction of classified information. Walsh's office, in meetings
with the Justice Department, then worked out the notification plan.
   Walsh says his procedure implements the judge's order directing
that the attorney general stay out of the case, but Gesell has made
no comment on it.
   Despite Gesell's rulings, the proposed plan gives the attorney
general too much influence, Sullivan and fellow defense attorney
Barry Simon said in a court brief.
   But Walsh said the defense motion ``is based on a misconception.''
   ``Independent counsel does not contemplate the trifling `bits and
pieces' activity by the attorney general'' which North ``professes
to anticipate,'' Walsh said. ``The day-to-day conduct of this case
will be by the independent counsel and only the independent
counsel.''
   Walsh said that he turns to the attorney general just as he turns
on occasion to other government agencies and that as long as the
agencies don't attempt ``to intrude in the courtroom,'' North has no
basis for objection.
   The North trial was delayed this week because the Justice
Department, fearful that North would spill government secrets in the
courtroom, obtained a Supreme Court stay of the proceedings. The
court vacated the stay Thursday, after Thornburgh said sufficient
safeguards were in place to protect national security.

   The delayed criminal trial of former White
House aide Oliver North will begin next Tuesday, court officials
said Friday after final rules for disclosure of national secrets
were ironed out.
   There was no word directly from U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell, but the officials said the last problems over guidelines for
handling classified information were resolved in closed meetings
Thursday and Friday.
   The officials spoke on condition that they not be identified.
Details of the resolution were not immediately announced.
   Jury selection was begun on Jan. 31 and finished on Feb. 9, but
that same day the Justice Department began efforts to delay the
trial because of concerns that Gesell's rules for national security
materials were not tight enough.
   The department lifted its objections Wednesday after receiving
assurances from independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, whose office is
prosecuting North, that undisclosable secrets will be protected.
   Prosecutor John Keker and chief defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan
will deliver their opening statements on Tuesday after the jury is
sworn.
   North's lawyers argued Friday that the jury must hear evidence
during the trial that he was under White House orders not to
disclose U.S. offers of favors to countries that helped arm the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   Most of the 12 criminal charges against North, a former National
Security Council aide, involve hiding from Congress and the attorney
general what the administration was doing to help the Contras.
   Because of national security secrets that swirl through material
that may be made public during the trial, Gesell has to decide in
advance what can and what cannot be presented to the jury. One of
the stickiest of those matters concerns the deals that may have been
struck with third countries for Contra aid.
   North's defense includes a contention that he was authorized to
do everything he did in diverting profits from Iranian arms sales to
help the Contras fighting the leftist government of Nicaragua.
   Gesell has said he will allow the government to make a general
``admission'' to the jury about the tit-for-tat arrangements rather
than allowing North's lawyers to present the matter in detail. The
issue involves substantial amounts of classified material.
   ``An admission forces the defense to forgo the presentation of
powerful evidence to the jury,'' North attorney Barry Simon said in
a court filing. ``In return the defense is entitled to a full and
candid concession of the basic facts that that evidence would prove,
together with the inference to be drawn from those basic facts.''
   The prosecution fails to acknowledge ``for the fourth time'' that
former president Reagan and other officials established a policy
that ``the quid pro quo and other third-country arrangements would
not be disclosed,'' Simon said. Quid pro quo means
something-for-something, or an exchange of favors.
   In its proposed admission, the government on Tuesday suggested
that in one instance ``North alone was responsible for devising a
means of concealing a quid pro quo arrangement from Congress,''
according to Simon.
   ``If the defense must be satisfied with a cold admission on the
quid pro quo issue _ and must give up its right to present the many
documents and the extensive live testimony that would bring the
issue to life for the jury _ then it must also have an admission on
the non-disclosure policy,'' said North's lawyers.
   Simon proposed that the prosecutor tell the jury in the first
paragraph ``that President Reagan and other top administration
officials'' established a don't-talk policy.
   He said also that the names of the Central American countries
involved in the arrangements must be disclosed at trial. During the
congressional Iran-Contra hearings two years ago, those countries
were not publicly identified.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has appealed
personally to President Bush to help bring peace to Afghanistan now
that the Red Army has withdrawn, a top Kremlin diplomat said Friday.
   Both the diplomat and a Soviet general acknowleged at a news
conference that the Soviets are worried about continued bloodshed in
Afghanistan, but rejected any parallels between their pullout and
the 1973 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam.
   ``The Americans simply fled and abandoned everything when they
left Vietnam,'' said Gen. Valentin I. Varennikov, deputy defense
minister and chief of Soviet ground forces. ``We did not abandon
anything. We were not in a rush.''
   Alexander A. Bessmertnykh, Soviet first deputy foreign minister,
said an ``individual message'' from Gorbachev to Bush seeks U.S.
backing for Kremlin suggestions on how to achieve a political
settlement in Afghanistan, including a halt in arms supplies to the
U.S.-backed insurgents and the establishment of a broader-based
government.
   ``We are proposing that we assist in a cease-fire,'' said
Bessmertnykh, referring to the joint superpower action sought by
Gorbachev. ``We consider that the United States and the Soviet Union
can always play a positive role.''
   In what appeared to be a wide-ranging Kremlin effort to prevent
the violent overthrow of the pro-Moscow government of President
Najib, the Soviets also sent messages to France, Britain, West
Germany and Italy asking them to give humanitarian and economic
assistance to Afghanistan, Bessmertnykh said.
   Messages were also sent to China, Iran and Pakistan, which have
given weapons and other support to the guerrillas.
   Western diplomats and the insurgents have predicted Najib's
government will fall soon now that the Soviets are gone. The last of
the Red Army's 115,000 soldiers that had been stationed there
returned home Wednesday.
   Bessmertnykh said the withdrawal had created an ``extraordinary
opportunity'' to end Afghanistan's nearly 11-year-old civil war,
sparked by the April 1978 coup in which the Marxist People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized power. The Soviets sent tanks
and troops in the following year.
   ``We believe all countries should respond to the emerging
opportunity to put an end to the drawn-out conflict by promoting the
complete and fast settlement of the situation and the reinstatement
of Afghanistan as a prosperous, strong, independent, neutral and
non-aligned nation,'' Bessmertnykh said.
   The message to Bush from Gorbachev was delivered to the White
House on Friday by Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, said Bush press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater. Bush, who was in St. Louis at the time,
did not have a chance to read the full letter, Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said the message from Gorbachev ``generally repeats
their public position.''
   Fitzwater said he did not want to be more specific about the
contents, although he noted the Soviet message did reiterate ``their
public positions about ending support for the rebels.''
   ``We don't have a detailed response. We just received the letter.
But our concerns remain the same,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush said Thursday he hoped the pullout would ensure ``no more
bloodbaths'' in Afghanistan, but rejected a Kremlin call for an
immediate cease-fire and an arms embargo.
   He said he could not endorse those measures because he was
concerned that the retreating Soviets might have left behind a
``tremendous amount'' of weapons and ammunition for their Afghan
allies.
   According to U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman,
there was a massive stockpiling of weapons in Afghanistan by the
Soviets recently, and they handed over to Najib's forces fighter
aircraft and helicopters, dozens of tanks, infantry fighting
vehicles, armored personnel carriers, more than 200 howitzers and
hundreds of transport vehicles.
   Bessmertnykh seemed at pains to put the best possible cast on
Bush's statements when he said the Soviets were encouraged by the
president's omission of any mention of continued U.S. arms supplies
to the guerrillas.
   He said the Soviets would like to take Bush's words ``at face
value.''
   Later Friday, a senior official on Secretary of State James A.
Baker's plane said U.S. weapons shipments to Moslem guerrillas in
Afghanistan will be continued even if the Soviet Union ceased its
support for the Kabul government.
   ``As long as the mujahedeen are fighting for the right of
self-determination, we should assist that effort,'' the official
said.
   Bessmertnykh also did not repeat Kremlin charges the United
States was violating the U.N.-brokered accords that led to the
Soviet pullout by shipping weapons to the insurgents.
   The departure of Soviet soldiers at a time of political
uncertainty has led some in the West to see similarities with South
Vietnam, where communist forces seized power in 1975, three years
after the departure of the last U.S. combat troops.
   ``There can be no parallels here,'' said Varennikov, who
previously served as the representative of the Soviet military
command in Afghanistan. ``Now that Soviet troops have gone, we have
left behind an integral and free state which is unfortunately still
engaged in a war against bands that are still aggressive.''
   Varennikov also said 30 Soviet military advisers remain in
Afghanistan under a bilateral Soviet-Afghan agreement.
   ``These are mostly Soviet military experts who will provide
various kinds of needed assistance and ensure the landing of Soviet
planes bringing food and other goods to Afghanistan,'' Varennikov
told the Tass news agency. He said the advisers were not attached to
Afghan military units, but to its government.

<HEAD>Rivers Crest Across Kentucky, But Tennessee Gets Fifth Day Of Rain</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   One town was an island and unknown number of people were homeless
Friday in flood-stricken Kentucky, where several swollen rivers
crested and began to recede, and sodden areas of Tennessee got a
fifth consecutive day of rain.
   Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson made another tour of flooded
areas Friday and was expected to seek a federal disaster declaration
to make the state eligible for federal assistance. Tennessee Gov.
Ned McWherter asked for similar relief Thursday.
   The two states have gotten a week of rain, more than 10 inches in
some places, that flooded roads, closed schools and some businesses
and claimed at least three lives.
   While the region is part of the area affected by last summer's
drought, Tennessee farmers worried that the heavy rain could harm
their winter wheat crops, planted last fall for harvest this year.
   The National Weather Service said several Kentucky streams had
crested, although the Ohio River, which forms Kentucky's northern
border, and the Green River in central Kentucky continued rising.
   Mike Callahan, a weather service hydrologist, said the broad Ohio
could force some river levels higher again when its high water backs
up into lower streams.
   Kentucky's capital city, Frankfort, got a break Friday when the
Kentucky River finally stopped rising, cresting 13.2 feet above
flood stage at 44.2 feet.
   Frankfort City Manager Ken Thompson said officials were still
trying to determine how many people were left homeless by the flood,
but there was no firm count because most evacuees moved in with
friends or relatives. He said there was water in several hundred
buildings in the city, but the state Capital complex was high and
dry.
   The city's civic center was packed with evacuees' furniture and
other belongings.
   The forecast was a chance of light snow or rain through Saturday,
with temperatures dropping.
   Hardest hit in Kentucky was the tiny town of Boston, about 23
miles south of Louisville, which became an island Thursday when the
last road into town was flooded. The Rolling Fork of the Salt River
reached a record-tying 51.7 feet, well above flood stage of 35 feet.
   Conditions in Boston won't improve significantly until the Ohio
crests at Louisville, 23 miles north, and allows the Salt River to
begin draining, Callahan said Friday.
   ``We've got plenty of food. As long as nobody gets sick, we're
all right,'' said Betty Vandiver, who has lived in Boston for 32
years.
   Rain fell Friday for the fifth straight day in much of western
and central Tennessee and more rain was forecast for Saturday.
   Since Monday in Tennessee, Memphis had received 5.29 inches of
rain, Jackson 5.24 inches and Nashville 5.30 inches. High water
overloaded Nashville's sewage system and raw waste was flowing
toward the Cumberland River.
   In flood-stricken Obion County, on Tennessee's northwestern
corner, the Obion River was receding after breaking a levee
Thursday, unleashing 3 feet of water that forced 377 people from
their homes in the towns of Obion and Rives.
   No injuries were reported, but at least 50 homes, two churches
and a fire station were flooded and Rives Elementary School was
closed.
   ``A lot of the houses that were damaged had as much as 3 feet of
water in them, and state Highway 216 had to be closed because the
pavement was uprooted by the water,'' said Cecil Whaley, an
operations officer for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.
``A lot of the homes had up to 50 percent damage. It could be quite
awhile before they get back into them.''
   Obion County, along with neighboring Dyer and Weakley counties,
account for a third of Tennessee's annual $73 million wheat crop,
the state's fifth leading cash crop, state agriculture officials
said.
   ``We'll experience some flooding in the wheat fields, but the
loss won't be known until spring,'' he said. ``This could hurt the
wheat crop if it continues. It needs to warm up and dry out.''

<TEXT>
   The commander of Lebanon's main Christian
militia ordered his fighters to withdraw from battle Friday after
the army chief threatened an ``apocalpyse'' to wipe them out.
   Lebanese Forces commander Samir Geagea, who has been fighting for
control of the nation's Christian community, said he was willing to
dissolve the militia if a conference of Christian religious and
political leaders asked him to.
   Intermittent duels with artillery and automatic weapons flared
earlier in the Christian sector of the divided capital, despite a
cease-fire signed Wednesday by Geagea and Gen. Michel Aoun, the army
chief.
   In Washington, Defense Department officials said at least 13
employees of the U.S. Embassy were evacuated to Cyprus. A Defense
Department employee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said about
25 remained at the embassy, which the State Department says has been
caught in a cross fire.
   The battles have deepened divisions in the Christian community in
this nation already torn by 14 years of civil war between Christians
and Moslems.
   In an effort to resolve the inter-Christian conflict peacefully,
Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir held a conference attended by 21
leading Maronite leaders in Bkirki, north of Beirut.
   Geagea told reporters after the four-hour meeting: ``I am
ordering all Lebanese Forces militiamen to withdraw from all fronts
back to their barracks. Never again will we collide with the army.''
   ``Whatever the general (Aoun) wants, we'll do,'' Geagea said.
   Asked if he will be willing to dissolve the 6,000-strong Lebanese
Forces, Geagea said, ``If the Bkirki conferees say so, I will. But
they haven't taken such a decision.''
   He said he was prepared to pull his militia from Christian east
Beirut if the Moslem sector was simultaneously brought under
exclusive control of the Lebanese army.
   ``From now on, we and Gen. Aoun are one hand,'' he declared.
   There was no immediate reaction from Aoun, who boycotted the
meeting. A statement by the conferees said they had briefed Aoun on
the deliberations. The conferees resolved to consolidate the
cease-fire, withdraw Lebanese Forces militiamen to their barracks
and apply law and order across Lebanon.
   Aoun, head of the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's dual
Moslem-Christian government, told a news conference earlier the
conditions that permitted the army to coexist with the militia no
longer existed.
   ``We are responsible for the state, and they want a ministate ...
Those who do not abide by the law, I'll crush their heads,'' said
Aoun, surrounded by senior officers of his 20,000-member
predominantly Christian army.
   Aoun said he had accepted a cease-fire mediated by Sfeir on
Wednesday only to allow political efforts to ``resolve the problem
peacefully.''
   ``Otherwise, it will be total destruction. This time it will be
an apocalypse,'' he said.
   Shortly after the news conference, the army announced that 2nd
Lt. Joseph Bitar was killed by sniper fire from Lebanese Forces
positions in east Beirut. That brought the death toll to 70 in
fighting that broke out late Tuesday. At least 197 people were
wounded.
   Aoun said the Lebanese Forces should compensate the people for
the damage and casualties out of taxes the militia levies.
   He said the militia charges about $400,000 a day in illegal
taxation of various businesses in the 310-square-mile enclave that
houses 1 million Christians.
   The Lebanese Forces and the various Moslem and leftist militias
have been collecting taxes in their respective areas of influence
since the civil war broke out in 1975.
   Aoun accused the militia of starting the previous round of
fighting, which involved an attack on his residence in east Beirut's
posh suburb of Rabieh.
   He said his forces ``confronted the attack,'' capturing five
armored personnel carriers and their crews.
   Aoun was named head of an interim military Cabinet by former
President Amin Gemayel minutes before Gemayel's term expired Sept.
22. Parliament has failed to elect a successor because Christians
opposed the Syrian-backed candidates.
   Aoun's appointment violated an unwritten national covenant that
gave the premiership to the Sunni Moslems, the presidency to the
Maronites and the house speakership to the Shiite Moslems.

<HEAD>Bush, Congressional Leaders Set Face-to-Face Budget Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday that fledgling talks
with Congress on his $1.16 trillion spending plan are making
progress and he will sit down with House and Senate leaders next
week to push for ``a quick and early resolution to this budget
crisis.''
   The president said top Democrats and Republicans in Congress will
come to the White House on Tuesday, the eve of Bush's departure on a
five-day trip to Asia.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the session was
intended to keep the momentum of budget talks going while Bush was
out of the country.
   Bush announced the conference with congressional leaders during a
speech before students at Washington University, his third address
in a week on the budget.
   He got a warm reception in the university field house, though
outside his motorcade encountered handfuls of demonstrators against
his anti-abortion stance.
   In his speech, Bush once again failed to offer a formula to
produce the $9.6 billion to $11 billion in budget cuts needed to
offset the cost of his commitments for new spending on domestic
programs such as education, child care, the homeless and cleaning up
the environment.
   ``There are certain priorities that demand attention,'' Bush
said. ``Yes, we can afford to increase spending _ modestly,
selectively but only after tough choices are made.''
   Democrats have complained that the president is taking credit for
expanding social spending while making Congress take responsibility
for finding ways to pay for it.
   However, Bush gave an upbeat assessment of the budget talks,
which are in their infancy, saying ``We are making progress.''
Suggesting he would share responsibility with Congress, he said,
``Together, we've got to make the budget process work.''
   ``I am committed to working closely with my friends on the Hill
to help them meet the target date set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
law for an April 15th budget resolution,'' Bush said.
   That law, which requires a balanced budget by 1993, calls for a
deficit in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1 of no more than
$100 billion _ down from an estimated $160 billion this year.
   Failure by Congress to meet the target could result in
across-the-board cuts.
   Bush said he wanted congressional leaders ``to come meet with me
and in a spirit of bipartisanship get on with the nation's business
of getting a quick and early resolution to this budget crisis.''
   In his remarks, Bush also stressed volunteerism _ one of his
favorite themes.
   ``My friends, from now on in America any definition of a
successful life must include serving others, in child-care center,
in the corporate boardroom, at the Rotary, at Little League, or a
tutoring program, and in a church or synagogue,'' Bush said.
   As for a federal role, he said, ``I know we can have a government
with a heart as well as a head.''
   Bush struck a decidely different tone from his predecessor,
Ronald Reagan, who portrayed the government almost as an enemy.
   ``The government's contribution is critical but by itself is
insufficient to solve all of our national problems,'' Bush said.
   ``Yes, most Americans believe that our efforts must reach beyond
government, to care about our communities and to assist our
neighbors,'' the president said. ``But they also believe that
government can be an important catalyst in that process of helping
individuals, our communities and our nation.''
   Fitzwater said participants at Tuesday's budget meeting will
include House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas; Majority Leader Tom
Foley, D-Wash.; Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.; Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine; Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., and the senior Democrats and Republicans from the
congressional budget, finance and appropriations committees.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, budget chief Richard Darman
and White House chief of staff John Sununu also will take part.
   After the speech, Bush had lunch with about two dozen people,
including students, senior citizens and participants in the Special
Olympics programs.
   The president would not respond to questions by reporters on a
soon-to-be-released FBI report on the qualifications of former Sen.
John Tower to be defense secretary. ``We're not going to have any
press questions. I'm not worried. I feel good today,'' Bush said.
   In Washington, congressional sources who requested anonymity said
a review of a security clearance application by a retired Air Force
officer included allegations about Tower's behavior as the head of
an American delegation to arms talks in Geneva in 1985 and 1986.
Among the allegations was one that Tower kept both his secretaries
in Geneva as mistresses.
   On another subject, Fitzwater told reporters that while Bush was
in St. Louis a letter to the president, delivered by Soviet
Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, had arrived at the White House from Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Fitzwater said that Bush had not had the opportunity to read the
letter in full and that a response had not been prepared. The
spokesman said Gorbachev's message ``relates generally to the
pullout of Soviet forces in Afghanistan. It generally repeats their
public position.''
   In Moscow, officials said Gorbachev had sent messages to Bush and
other world leaders asking for help in ending the war between Afghan
factions following the Red Army pullout.

   Authorities said they were taking ``extremely
seriously'' a threat in India to bomb British Airways flights
because of the controversy over Salman Rushdie's book ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Britain protested to Iran after Ayatollah Khomeini urged Moslems
to kill Rushdie, an Indian-born British citizen, because he wrote a
book that religious zealots say slanders Islam. Iranian religious
leaders have offered a $5.2 million bounty for the killing of
Rushdie.
   Rushdie, 41, and his wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins,
remained under police guard today at an undisclosed site in Britain
in fear of their lives.
   In Iran today, President Ali Khamenei demanded that Britain
explain why it permitted the publication of the book, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.

   The nation's largest bookseller, Waldenbooks, ordered ``The
Satanic Verses'' off store shelves for fear that threats of violence
against the book's author and publisher might extend to its
employees.
   But the book was missing from many bookstore shelves today for
another reason: Sales were booming.
   ``This is not a freedom of speech issue _ the sole reason is the
protection of our employees,'' Bonnie Predd, executive vice
president of Waldenbooks, said after the chain ordered its copies
removed from display Thursday.
   ``We've fought long and hard against censorship,'' Predd was
quoted as saying in today's editions of The New York Times. ``But
when it comes to the safety of our employees, one sometimes has to
compromise.''

   A worldwide aviation agency will study ways to
screen radios, tape players and other seemingly harmless devices
that could be used to smuggle a terrorist bomb aboard an airplane.
   The 33-nation council of the International Civil Aviation
Organization ordered the study the same day British authorities in
Lockerbie, Scotland, said the bomb that brought down Pan Am Flight
103 was hidden in a radio-cassette player.
   U.S. and British aviation authorities requested the two-day
session that concluded Thursday in Montreal following the Dec. 21
bombing over Scotland that killed 259 people on the plane and 11 on
the ground.
   The council ordered its staff to investigate what measures could
be taken to prevent further terrorist sabotage aboard aircraft, and
said it will make those recommendations in several months to the
160-member International Civil Aviation Organization, the air
affiliate of the United Nations.

   President Bush says he will continue helping
rebel groups in Afghanistan after the Soviet Army's withdrawal, and
fully intends to support the Contras in Nicaragua when their current
aid expires next month.
   Bush said Thursday he preferred a peaceful reconciliation in
Afghanistan but was concerned that departing Soviet forces may have
stockpiled weapons for the Marxist government in Kabul.
   ``It would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethal
supplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance and
thus leave an uacceptable imbalance,'' he said in a session with
reporters in the Oval Office.
   Bush's remarks came a day after Soviet troops completed their
withdrawal. Their departure has caused widespread fears that a
struggle for control by competing guerrilla groups could throw
Afghanistan into a civil war.

   Air pollution last summer was the worst of the
decade and the number of cities where ozone exceeded federally
approved levels jumped 41 percent, according to preliminary federal
figures.
   ``This new information shows the clear fallacy in industry
arguments that America's air pollution problems are solving
themselves,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who made the figures
public on Thursday.
   A year ago the Environmental Protection Agency listed 68 cities
that had recorded peak ozone levels considered unsafe under federal
standards. Last summer the number jumped to 96 metropolitan areas
plus two areas considered to be rural.
   The House subcommittee on health and environment, chaired by
Waxman, had requested the data from the federal agency.

   Britain's Prince Charles is planning a talk
with President Bush over dinner tonight about protecting the
environment, one of the future king's favorite causes, before he
flies to sunny Florida for two days of polo.
   The 40-year-old prince arrived in New York late Thursday for his
eighth visit to the United States. He is not accompanied by his
wife, Diana, who made a hit with New Yorkers during her own solo
visit a couple of weeks ago.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, invited the prince and British
ambassador Sir Antony Acland to a small, informal dinner party at
Camp David, Md., where the Bushes will be spending the weekend.
   British officials said Prince Charles' concerns about the
environment probably would be a major topic at his lunch at the
British Embassy today with a select group of American movers and
shakers, and likely would figure in his conversation with Bush at
Camp David.

<HEAD>Dairy Herds Free Of Pesticide; Lost Dreams And Lawsuits Remain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAVE SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nature slowly cleansed their dairy
herds of heptachlor, but a legacy of lost dreams and lawsuits
endures for Ozarks farmers who unwittingly bought the banned
pesticide in cheap livestock feed.
   ``Most have survived all this, but they are a lot worse off now
financially than they were before,'' said state Sen. Bill Walters,
who filed lawsuits for some farmers. ``I've sat at their kitchen
tables and seen them cry.''
   A settlement involving 48 farmers expected this month would close
out a saga of deceit, confusion and fear that began in the mid-1980s
when heptachlor-treated seed was fermented to make gasohol and the
resulting mash was illegally sold as feed. The government recalled
milk and quarantined farms.
   ``We are in the final throes of the final settlement with the
final defendants,'' said attorney John Elrod of Siloam Springs. None
of the attorneys for farmers will disclose details of any
settlements, but Elrod said this final one would ``come pretty darn
close'' to adequately compensating his clients.
   ``Some of these farmers were in their 50s and 60s, and dairies
had been their entire livelihood,'' said Steve Hignight, the Benton
County Cooperative Extension Service agent. ``Then, all of a sudden,
you've still got all your expenses and you've got nothing coming in
and everything's going out.''
   Hignight had advised against buying the mash that was sold by
J.E.W. Inc. and Valley Feeds Inc., not because of contamination _
knowledge of that didn't come until later _ but because its high
water content cut cost-effectiveness.
   But to farmers who bought the mash in Arkansas, Oklahoma and
Missouri, the price seemed right. Tons were consumed here in
Arkansas' top dairy county.
   Farmers' delight at finding an inexpensive feed source turned to
shock, then helplessness, in March 1986 when tests showed their
dairy products were tainted with the suspected carcinogen banned in
1983 for general use.
   Authorities recalled dairy products in Arkansas, Oklahoma,
Missouri, Kansas, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana and Tennessee and
warned nursing mothers not to drink milk. The Food and Drug
Administration quarantined more than 130 dairy herds in the three
states where the feed was sold.
   ``I had to be more of a listening ear than anything else,
offering a couch for people to talk,'' said Hignight. ``A lot of
times with these producers, all you could do was spend a little time
with them.''
   Jim Brown, manager of Cave Springs Farmers Cooperative in this
town between Bentonville and Springdale, lost $90,000 in sales when
one quarantined dairyman turned to the turkey business. He is
grateful more dairies weren't shut down.
   Many dairies were heptachlor-free, and the quarantine eventually
was lifted for all but 137 herds in the three states. Most herds
were declared clear of contamination within 18 months. But with
nature's slow flushing of the heptachlor, a few herds emerged from
the ban only last fall.
   Heptachlor settles in fatty tissues, and the only way to purge it
from cattle is milking _ a frustrating task for farmers who poured
the frothy fresh product onto pastures. ``For well over a year and a
half, that's all they did _ milk and dump, because they were unable
to do anything else,'' Hignight said.
   As the farmers searched for answers, ``we had folks come in with
black magic and everything else that would cure you out in two
weeks, and really sold them a bill of goods.'' One such ``cure''
proved to be charcoal, ``and they got people to buy it at a time
when they already had their feet kicked out from under them,'' he
said. ``All I remember is it was outrageous beyond reason.''
   Diversification saved some families, and scores got low-interest
loans from cooperatives that marketed their milk. They were repaid
when farmers got loans from the federal Dairy Indemnity Fund. The
U.S. Agriculture Department paid more than $5.2 million to farmers
in the three states _ $3.4 million to Arkansas, $1.3 million to
Oklahoma and $524,000 to Missouri.
   Court judgments to farmers allowed them to repay the fund about
$480,000 by early this month, said USDA spokesman Clarence Domire in
Washington. Elrod said the repayments are closer to $700,000, and
that the remaining reimbursement is a critical issue in settling his
sweeping lawsuit _ the largest filed.
   Participating in the proposed settlement, Elrod said, would be
J.E.W. and Valley Feeds; Velsicol Chemical Corp. of Memphis, Tenn.,
which made heptachlor; Ceiba-Geigy Corp., parent of Funk's Seed Co.,
which sold tainted grain to the Van Buren companies; and Great
Northern Commodities of Detroit, a seed broker.
   In addition, four J.E.W. officers were convicted or pleaded
guilty to a variety of charges including wire fraud and adulterating
feed.
   The farmers, most of whom have been involved in settlements,
won't talk about the case or their problems, but Brown said justice
prevailed.
   ``It's just like me coming up here and taking your car away from
you, and going to your house and burning your house down, and you
get fired for it and you knew it was beyond your control. Where are
you going to turn?
   ``This whole community felt it and it was a bad situation. But
they are fighting back. They're fighters and they're going to make
it.''
   Walters agreed: ``It can take the heart out of a family, but one
thing about farmers in general is they are tough and they are
survivors. And these farmers will come back.''

<HEAD>Mysterious Orthodox Group Terrorizes Secular Israelis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new group of Jewish radicals is trying to
enforce ultra-Orthodox religious beliefs by painting swastikas on
the tombstones of Israel's founders and bombing sex shops and
newspaper stands.
   Police say the mysterious group of Jewish activists is called the
``Keshet'' (``Keepers of the Torah'') and uses army-issued
explosives, either stolen from army bases or supplied to them by
military sympathizers.
   Their campaign, a renewal of the long battle against Israeli
secular society by Orthodox fundamentalists, has included the
planting of more than a dozen bombs and the tossing of a grenade
into a Jerusalem sex shop.
   No one has been hurt in the attacks, partly because anonymous
phone calls often warn in advance that bombs have been planted.
   Ehud Sprintzak, an expert on Jewish radical groups, says Keshet's
activities are not intended to kill but to terrorize secular
Israelis.
   ``The Orthodox can use violence and beatings. Somebody can get
burned by accident. But killing a Jew is taboo for them,'' said
Sprintzak, a Hebrew University political scientist.
   ``It's the outer side of what happens inside the Jewish Orthodox
society,'' he said. ``There is much violence inside that society.''
   Rafi Levy, a Police Ministry spokesman, said police are worried
by the Keshet campaign.
   ``We treat them very seriously. After all, it's an underground
Jewish organization, a terror group,'' he said.
   The Keshet campaign is based in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak
and the Mea Shearim neighborhood in Jerusalem, both Orthodox areas
where the group's ideas find some sympathy.
   While the group's methods are denounced by many ultra-Orthodox
Jews, most support Keshet's aims of enforcing public observance of
the Jewish Sabbath, the biblical rest day from sundown Friday to
sundown Saturday, and other religious commandments.
   In early February police raided ghetto-like Mea Shearim and 10
members of leading Orthodox families were detained.
   Less than a week later, a caller saying he was from Keshet warned
of another bomb in a working-class neighborhood bordering Mea
Shearim. The bomb was safely dismantled.
   The Keshet campaign began in August 1986 when the tombstone of
Theodore Herzl, a pioneer of the Zionist idea of founding a Jewish
state in Israel, was defaced with swastikas on Mount Herzl near
Jerusalem.
   This kind of activitiy stems from the ultra-Orthodox belief that
the state of Israel should not come into being until the Messiah
appears.
   Attacks continued this past August with bombs set off at three
newsstands selling secular newspapers in Bnei Brak. A series of 10
bombs then were planted at similar targets, but anonymous phone
calls have warned of the explosives.
   Among other activities blamed on Keshet were incendiary bombs
found and dismantled under a bridge on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv
highway Dec. 31. On Jan. 8, an assailant believed to be Orthodox
hurled a grenade into a sex shop in downtown Jerusalem, damaging the
shop but injuring no one.
   The attackers usually leave police no doubt who is responsible.
   On Feb. 6, the tombstone of David Ben-Gurion was defaced with
swastikas at the Sde Boker communal farm where Israel's first
premier had lived. It was signed: ``Keshet: Search for us.''
   Sprintzak said the name Keshet has been around since the 1960s
and is associated with earlier campaigns to close movie theaters and
restaurants on the Sabbath, to protest autopsies or to stop
archaeological digs seen as desecrating ancient Jewish graves.
   ``In the Orthodox circles, it's an idea, a concept. But there is
an organization behind the concept,'' he said. ``I estimate that
Keshet is a small group that organizes on an ad hoc basis.''
   Yehuda Meshi-Zahav, 30, who was arrested and released in
connection with the police investigation of Keshet, said in a
newspaper interview he doubted police could stop the attacks.
   ``Police ... think we have an underground. Many years ago, when
we fought against autopsies, the activists were called Keshet.
Today, there is no such thing,'' he was quoted as saying.
   ``We don't have a chief of staff and officers,'' he said. ``But
to mobilize men for the action at any time is of no problem to us.
We are all soldiers in the Almighty's army.''

   Two weeks of skiing, boating, fishing or
hiking in an unspoiled forest of pine and birch.
   That's what Sweden's National Prison Administration offers as a
vacation for hardened criminals serving prison time.
   The vacationers at Gruvberget, a former logging camp 125 miles
north of Stockholm, are convicted murderers, rapists, drug dealers
and other felons serving long-term sentences.
   ``We have the lowest walls of any prison in the world, but they
are also the thickest,'' said director Rolf Johansson, referring to
the 12 miles of hilly woodland to the nearest farm.
   Up to 30 prisoners at a time stay at the mountain retreat for two
weeks, many with their wives and children. Prison officials number
three, and none have weapons.
   Sweden has one of the world's most liberal corrections systems;
prisoners are called ``clients,'' furloughs are frequent and the
accent is on rehabilitation.
   ``We want to give clients the opportunity to meet their wives and
children outside the walls of prison, and to give them new ideas
about life,'' said Johansson.
   ``This is a great place,'' said an American doing time for
selling drugs. ``I've been learning cross-country skiing. Yesterday
we went walking seven or eight kilometers (four or five miles) in
the woods and had a cookout _ hot dogs.
   ``It's like a real vacation. It's helping us re-cement our
relationship,'' he added, nodding toward his Swedish wife. The
45-year-old former social worker refused to give his name. ``Just
call me Jack, OK?'' He said he was a Vietnam deserter and has been
in Sweden for 20 years.
   After completing one-third of their terms, prisoners are eligible
for furloughs of up to 48 hours as often as six times a year. Most
prisons have conjugal rooms for visits from wives or girlfriends,
and marriage is not a visiting requirement.
   The furlough system was curtailed for a time after the escape in
October 1987 of one Sweden's most notorious spies, Stig Bergling,
who apparently slipped out of the country while home on a weekend
furlough.
   The prison service reported 287 cases of prisoners returning late
or drunk from the 8,951 furloughs granted in 1987, the latest year
for which statistics are available. About 15,000 people were
sentenced to prison that year, 8,000 to sentences of less than two
months, and 1,500 for more than one year.
   No one has ever tried to escape from Gruvberget. The guests are
given train tickets at their home prison and make their own way to
the village. Since most are nearing parole, Johansson said, it would
make little sense to jeopardize the release.
   One recent day, skis were propped against the wooden two-story
cottages, which were built in the 1950s for woodcutters and their
families.
   Four men in jeans or jogging suits were lazing in winter
sunshine. Two were with their wives, and children were crashing
through the nearby woods. They were waiting for a gray prison bus to
take them to a public ski slope about a half-hour away.
   The Prisons Administration bought the village 27 miles from
Ockelbo, the nearest town, in 1968. A full-sized basketball gym and
a small dining hall were added to the 22 existing buildings,
including the loggers' cabins.
   It took four years before the authorities could override the
skeptics and invite the first group of prisoners, Johansson said.
   Neighboring villages ``were a little worried when we started,''
Johansson said. ``Over the years they got used to us.''
   About 1,100 prisoners a year spend time at the vacation camp.
About twice that number apply, Johansson said. They are selected on
the basis of good behavior and a clean record on previous furloughs.
   Each two-week session is built around an activity theme. One
popular course is ``dance and exercise,'' in which the prisoners do
physical training, aerobics and learn ballroom dances.
   Johansson said religious classes are often requested by men
convicted of murder or manslaughter. Other sessions feature seminars
in family life or resisting drugs.
   ``Mainly we try to teach them basic things: to cook, to dance or
to walk in the woods with their children, which they have never
done,'' Johansson said.
   For the prisoners, furloughs and the special experience of
Gruvberget are lifelines to the world outside the walls.
   ``If I couldn't see my wife on the weekends, be with the kids a
couple or three hours a week, be able to touch them, I'd lose
contact with life,'' said Jack the American.
   ``In the States, if you get six years you'll sit for four, five
or maybe all six,'' he said. ``And conjugal visits? Forget it. But
that's what holds families together. If you have that kind of
contact, you can get back into life again.''

   Four years ago, art conservator Martin J.
Radecki helped uncover more than two dozen forged paintings worth
more than $200,000.
   Now he wants to educate art consumers to spot the forgeries
themselves, using works falsely attributed to Hoosier impressionist
artists T.C. Steele and William Forsythe to illustrate his points in
an exhibit at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.
   ``Every major collector has gotten a few fakes,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``In fact, you could say you're not a major
collector until you've gotten a bad one.''
   About five years ago works by the ``Hoosier Group'' of artists
gained new popularity from a rekindled interest in regional art.
Steele, from Owen County, and Forsythe, from Indianapolis, and the
others were landscape and figure painters who had flourished at the
turn of the century.
   While their paintings were greatly distributed in schools and
libraries across the state, little was widely known about their
individual styles. Those were perfect conditions for the forgeries,
some of them badly done, to enter the market.
   Radecki, chief conservator at the museum since 1975, spotted his
first forged Steele that year while the staff was preparing a show
in conjunction with the U.S. Bicentennial.
   ``Immediately the sky seemed odd to me,'' he said of the
painting, a landscape with a woman carrying a red umbrella. However,
he suspected it was merely a poor restoration rather than a forgery,
until a collector brought in the original of the same work a week
later.
   ``It's like the light bulb turns on _ maybe there's more than I
was thinking about,'' he said. ``Steele did not paint any exact
duplicates ... not in landscapes. We were shocked.''
   Nine years later, more Steele forgeries and some works by
Forsythe began turning up. Some were betrayed by the odor of fresh
paint, others were detected only through painstaking tests. City and
state police investigations eventually led to guilty pleas on
different charges by two art dealers, an artist and a local attorney.
   The captured forgeries were turned over to the museum to be kept
off the market and used as educational tools. They form the basis
for Radecki's first exhibit, ``Is it Genuine? Steele, Forsythe and
Forgery in Indiana,'' which runs through March 19.
   ``It's a much more technical exhibition than you normally see,''
Radecki said. ``I wanted to follow the methods we used when we did
the investigation.''
   The exhibit opens by defining fakes and forgeries and their
methods and proceeds to examine how a bogus work can be discovered.
Canvases and the stretchers used to spread them are examined, as are
more sophisticated tools such as comparisons with ultraviolet light
and radiograms.
   Steele originals are displayed alongside the forgeries, and the
differences are striking. The forged version of Steele's classic
``Pleasant Run,'' for instance, deletes the bridge from the original
and instead inserts a cabin.
   ``Some of these, the fraudulent ones, were not very good,''
Radecki said. The forgeries sold for as much as $8,000 when their
actual worth might be only a tenth of that sum.
   The exhibit concludes with a test in which museum-goers can try
to pick five originals from five forgeries.
   ``I would hope we've done a service to the public who will be out
there purchasing paintings,'' Radecki said.
   As recently as two months ago, a forged Steele seascape was
traded at an Illinois art auction, he said.
   ``I am certain we did not find them all. There are still some out
there,'' Radecki said. ``One still has to be careful, not only with
Steele and Forsythe, but with any painting.''

<HEAD>Someday a Pay Raise, But Not Soon</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Someday, somehow, Congress is going to have to
raise its pay. But for now, political paralysis is keeping the
salary lid on for House and Senate members _ and for judges and top
administration officials, too.
   When Congress gave up its 51 percent pay raise for fear of a
voter rebellion, the action also froze salaries for 1,100 federal
judges, 834 appointed officials who manage Cabinet and similar
agencies, 7,000 top civil servants, 12,000 foreign service employes
and 155 generals and admirals.
   The salary commission that recommended a $45,500 raise for
Congress also proposed increases for judges, Cabinet officers and
other appointed positions. They were part of the package that would
have become effective automatically Feb. 8 if it had not been vetoed
by both houses of Congress.
   It was.
   The other salaries are pegged to those at the top.
   As Robert F. Kennedy once said, ``I'm sorry to have taken so many
nice fellows over the side with me.'' Kennedy, then attorney
general, was joking about President Lyndon B. Johnson's announcement
that no member of his Cabinet would be on the 1964 Democratic ticket
as vice presidential nominee.
   With its rejection of this year's pay raise, Congress may have
effectively scuttled the system under which salaries were proposed,
by an appointed panel insulated against voter punishment for
unpopular increases. The recommendations went to presidents who
could reject or revise them. Then they were to take effect in 30
days unless the House and Senate both said no.
   Congress linked judicial and executive branch salaries to its own
as part of the same system of political insulation.
   President Bush had supported the raise, and when Congress turned
it down he said judicial salaries should be increased separately if
not as part of the pay package. He said he would make a pay
recommendation to Congress later in the year.
   ``I believe that some level of pay increase is in order and I
will be working with the House and Senate leadership to achieve that
end,'' Bush said.
   But first, a cooling off period. Speaker Jim Wright of Texas,
battered by both sides on the pay issue, said the House won't be
looking at new pay plans any time soon.
   Judicial salaries are a particular problem, given the high price
of lawyers these days. Federal district judges get the same $89,500
a member of Congress gets, and increasing numbers have been
resigning their lifetime appointments in favor of private practice.
   While judicial salaries have been increased six times during the
last decade, the raises represent just over half the increase in the
cost of living. Judges complain that their real buying power has
declined by one-third in the past 20 years.
   But Congress likes the package approach that ties their salary
increases to those of judges and other officials, on the
safety-in-numbers theory that didn't work this time.
   That leaves Congress, and the entire government, back at square
one on the salary problem. The Constitution says congressional
compensation is ``to be ascertained by law,'' which means by
Congress. And Congress still shrinks from the risk of voting to
ascertain that it merits a raise. Former Sen. Howard Baker Jr. says
Congress may be institutionally incapable of setting its own salary.
``It is the grand daddy conflict of interest of all time,'' he told
the salary commission.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois has proposed what he says would
be a way out. He calls it ``the sign-in system,'' and says it is
based on the notion that congressmen should be honest about their
salaries.
   He's introduced a bill under which members would determine their
own salaries, within a range between the current salary and the
$135,000 a year the commission recommended. Each member would pick a
number, announce it and be judged on it by constituents in the next
election.
   It is an idea whose time is not likely to come, given the fact
that choosing a raise individually would be even riskier than voting
for one on the floor.
   Rostenkowski, a 30-year man who chairs the Ways and Means
Committee, said he'd sign up for the maximum because he's worth it.

<TEXT>
   Eighty years ago, federal officials told the
District of Columbia to build its new prison in the rolling Virginia
hills 20 miles away, near Lorton.
   Today, like an unwanted neighbor who refuses to move, the prison
complex, badly overcrowded and antiquated, is a source of fear to
residents in the suburbs that grew up around it.
   District officials say they've been blocked at every turn in
attempts to ease the problems at the Lorton corrections complex and
there's little they can do.
   ``We've lost control,'' concedes Charlie Peelie, one of the
guards charged with keeping order among the 8,600 inmates. ``It's
just that there are too many people here.''
   ``We live on a powder keg,'' says neighbor Helen Thacker, hoping
her alarm system and the heavy locks on her backyard gates will
protect her the next time someone escapes.
   ``Everybody wants everybody locked up, but not in their
neighborhood,'' says Marion S. Barry Jr., the district's mayor. ``We
have to do something.''
   But what?
   Barry has proposed building a new prison in the city, while also
expanding Lorton. Preservationists are trying to stop the proposed
facility in the district; Virginia officials, led by their
congressman, are blocking any expansion of the present prison.
   All the while, conditions inside the 200-acre complex grow ever
worse.
   The prison is 1,400 prisoners over capacity and is expected to
add at least 4,000 more inmates by the turn of the century.
   Men stand in line for hours at mealtime. Showers and toilets are
in short supply. Recreational facilities are so scarce that some men
sit around for lack of anything better to do. Two men sleep in cells
built for one.
   ``The inmates are very uncomfortable and tempers are short,''
says a prison chaplain, the Rev. Manning Moore. ``There are men who
are cursing for attention and can't get it.''
   It was such an eruption in tempers that drew the nation's
attention hours after George Bush was sworn in as president Jan. 20.
One inmate was stabbed to death; fires set by free-running prisoners
destroyed two buildings.
   No one escaped.
   Twelve men did last year. Three are still at large _ one who was
convicted of manslaugher and two who were serving time for
first-degree murders.
   Residents of Fairfax County, some of whom live within a block or
two of the prison, say they've seen escaped inmates walking around
their neighborhood at night.
   Lisa Walker frets when her 5-year-old son plays outside her
backyard and owns a Doberman pinscher to fend off intruders.
   ``I have guns,'' she adds, ``and if I need to protect myself or
my son, I'll do it.''
   District officials say such fears are exaggerated.
   ``People in Fairfax County are so scared. But we have never had
an incident in Fairfax.'' says Corrections Department spokeswomen
Pat Wheeler. The escapees ``almost always go back to Southeast
(Washington). If you watch the homes of their family and friends
long enough, you'll usually find them.''
   Beyond the daily concern about escapes, residents of Fairfax
County, one of the wealthiest counties anywere, wonder about the
prison's future.
   So does the Barry administration, which has proposed spending
$350 million over a decade to modernize Lorton, expand the
district's halfway house program and build a second prison near the
city jail in Southeast Washington.
   In all, those efforts would add 3,525 beds to the 7,200 that are
considered capacity at Lorton.
   Much of the district's program focuses on Lorton, where only 200
of 2,000 acres are utilized. ``The most appropriate place'' for a
new prison, says Ms. Wheeler, ``would be to build it in Virginia.''
   Wrong, says Rep. Stan Parris, the Republican congressman whose
district includes Lorton.
   ``The situation at Lorton reached crisis proportions a decade ago
and it has continued to deteriorate,'' Parris said after last
month's uprising.
   Last October, he succeeded in having Congress deny the city's
request for $45 million to build an 800-bed facility at Lorton.
While the city operates the prison, it is owned by the federal
government, which would have to pay for any improvements.
   ``It's the only penal institution in the nation that's located
outside the political boundaries it's supposed to serve,'' Parris
says.
   ``I think the penal requirements of the District of Columbia are
best served by the construction of a new and modern facility within
the district. ... But, like a sewage plant or a dump or anything
else, nobody wants it in their neighborhoods.''
   At least not those near the city jail, who obtained a historic
designation for the site of the proposed second prison, delaying
officials' plans.
   Late last year, however, the city's Historic Preservation Board
rejected the community group's arguments. Officials now hope to
begin construction this spring.
   Congress approved $50 million for a new prison three years ago.
With the delays, says Ms. Wheeler, ``I'm sure it must cost more''
than that, even if construction began today, ``and the group of
people who are going to suffer for this are the taxpayers _ and
they're going to have to make up the difference.''
   So acute is the district's need for prison space that about 500
inmates have been shipped, at a cost of $60 a day, to prisons in
Washington state, Nevada, Texas and Virginia. Fifty inmates sent to
the Spokane, Wash., county jail were so disruptive that several had
to be sent elsewhere and jail guards at one point threatened a
strike unless security was tightened.
   Part of the problem of finding space for inmates, city officials
say, is the district's burgeoning violent crime rate.
   Serious crime rose 19 percent in the first 11 months of 1988,
compared to the same period in 1987, with homicides last year
hitting a record 372. The homicide rate so far this year is running
more than 50 percent ahead of last year's pace.
   But a lawyer for several Lorton inmates disagrees.
   An increase in the prison population ``is something they should
have anticipted many years ago,'' says Doug Hilliboe. ``I think
that's just the weakest excuse.''

<HEAD>Louis Gossett Jr. Takes on Series TV in `Gideon Oliver'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you want to entice Louis Gossett, dangle an
exotic locale in front of him.
   That's what the Academy Award-winning actor said drew him to the
television movie series ``Gideon Oliver,'' premiering tonight on
``The ABC Mystery Movie.'' Gossett plays a brilliant anthropology
professor who solves crimes that involve exotic cultures.
   Gossett made the hit action film ``Iron Eagle'' in Israel, the
sci-fi drama ``Enemy Mine'' in West Germany, and his new movie,
``The Punisher,'' was filmed in Australia.
   Well, so the first two episodes of ``Gideon Oliver'' were shot in
New York. ``I'm from here, and the reception is very warm. Gets me
through the cold winter day,'' Gossett said during a break in
shooting on location in Manhattan's Chinatown. ``It's nice working
with New York people. They're pretty real.''
   Co-executive producer Dick Wolf puts the cost per episode of
``Gideon Oliver'' at about $3 million. Last month, the production
moved to Mexico for stories set in South America and the Caribbean.
And if not for the writers' strike last summer that delayed the
start of the season, Gossett said, the first episode would have been
filmed in Moscow. Maybe next season. And maybe Borneo, Japan and
Australia, too. Wolf even hopes to shoot in Beijing.
   ``That's exciting to me,'' Gossett said. ``I've got some kids it
would be wonderful to take with me, and it's an education that's
just priceless.''
   Gossett, 51, married soap opera star Cyndi Reese Gossett in 1987.
He has two sons, Satie, 14, from a previous marriage, and Sharron,
11, whose adoption just became final.
   Gossett, who grew up in the Sheepshead Bay-Coney Island section
of Brooklyn _ ``I had to get a tongue transplant and a passport to
get out of there,'' he laughed _ now lives in Malibu, Calif.
   ``I wasn't happy until I saw the ocean again,'' he said. ``I felt
quite stifled in California, because it's slow and plodding and you
have to get in cars. Then I found Malibu. I went to a beach party,
and I never left. It's that infinity. Something happens to you. What
I needed was to be at the sea.''
   ``Gideon Oliver'' rotates with two other movie series, Peter
Falk's ``Columbo'' and ``B.L. Stryker,'' starring Burt Reynolds.
   ``Gideon Oliver'' comes from producers and writers whose credits
include ``Hill Street Blues,'' ``Murder, She Wrote'' and ``Miami
Vice.''
   ``I said, now this is a challenge,'' Gossett said. ``This is
something I can do and not get bored with, with the repetition of.
And they got the best of television to do it for me in (producers)
Bill Sackheim and Dick Wolf and David Black. The best. If you can't
do it with the best like that, I can't do it.''
   As the crew set up across the street in Chinatown, Gossett stood
around and entertained a cluster of fans. ``You the guy in `Iron
Eagle'?'' an eager youth asked. Gossett said yes. ``You really fly
that plane?'' the young man asked. Gossett allowed that no, he rode
in the plane, but he didn't actually fly it.
   Though he's played Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, won his Oscar
for a simmering portrayal of the drill sergeant in ``An Officer and
a Gentleman,'' and is best-known on television for his role as
Fiddler in ``Roots,'' Gossett has a huge following from his action
movies.
   Gideon Oliver is a karate expert who can take care of himself,
but, said Gossett, ``if he gets hit, it's got to hurt, and if he
hits somebody that's got to hurt his hand.''
   ``What I'm trying to do is be careful with `Gideon Oliver,'
because it would be easy to do all action in these episodes,''
Gossett said. ``It leaves out his intelligence, his sense of humor,
his caring, otherwise.''
   ``The wonderful thing about the show is it is not easily
categorized,'' said Wolf. ``He's not a cop, he doesn't carry a gun,
he's not a private detective, he's not a coroner. He's a guy who
understands subgroups because he's an anthropologist.
   ``As he says in the first show, he believes in the Socratic
method, which is the acquisition of knowledge through the asking and
answering of questions.''
   The Nielsen ratings will answer the question of whether a
not-easily categorized show can survive on network television, but
Gossett sees no end of possible stories.
   ``As long as there's man's inhumanity to man, as long as there's
cultural deprivation, as long as there's conflict of some sort in
this world _ and it doesn't look like it's going to be over any time
soon _ there's reason to have another episode,'' he said.

<HEAD>Is The Quality of Service Improving?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the most cynical little intrusions into
the quality of life today is the telephone solicitation at
dinnertime from a bank promoting a credit card or a marketing firm
conducting a survey.
   Most people would probably rank it as one of those nagging little
mosquuito bites of life that must be endured, too small a matter to
make an issue of, but certainly an irritant that their lives could
do without.
   It is when the mosquitoes swarm that the minor peeves become
unendurable, and no less an authority on the subject than ``The
Quality Review'' has given recognition to the disturbing phenomenon.
   The review, published by the American Quality Foundation and the
American Society for Quality Control, usually concerns itself with
momentous issues of product quality, especially as they relate to
American competitiveness.
   In the past, for example, it has declaimed on such matters as
Detroit's manufacturing problems, Japan's production efficiencies,
and engineering and statistical strategies for maintaining high
quality in goods production.
   Its descent into the more mundane world of pet peeves is provoked
by the feeling that the mosquitoes are everywhere, and that all
those little bites are leaving a welt on the quality of life equal
to that of shoddy products.
   Judging from its list, the irritants are all the more irritating
because as the country immerses itself deeper into the service
economy _ as opposed to an economy of goods production _ it may be
getting less service than ever before.
   First on its list is the unreturned telephone call. Making it
especially frustrating is that the original call probably was
received by a machine which, in its recorded voice, assured the
caller that a response would be forthcoming.
   It may lead to telephone tag, with each party making successive
fruitless attempts to return a call. The Review editors comment that
``this time-wasting endeavor is equivalent to rework in the
manufacturing arena.''
   Dinnertime sales or solicitation calls earned second place on the
list, and provoked the suggestion that the way to deal with them is
to screen your calls through an answering machine. Which, however,
may be your friends' pet peeve.
   Hotel telephone operators who leave you holding the phone so long
that you have to redial _ long-distance _ in order to leave a
message, make the list.
   ``Indefinitely delayed'' notices at airports earn a place, along
with the comment, ``If the airline can't bring itself to be upfront
with the information that this flight may never leave the ground,
maybe they could post the odds.''
   Travelers who pre-empt overhead baggage compartments, sales
clerks who turn their backs on customers to serve telephone
customers instead, and servicemen or delivery men who keep you
waiting all day are high on the Review's list.
   One of the more serious of its pet peeves _ one that seemingly
could rank with some of the old-fashioned complaints that quality
control people used to be concerned with _ is the service contract.
   Even customers who purchase these contracts think they are a bad
idea, it says. It asks: ``Why should anyone need a five-year service
contract on a water heater that is `guaranteed' for 10 years?''
   All pet peeve lists are likely to differ, especially if an
attempt is made to limit them to a specific number.
   The Review, for example, feels that impenetrable packaging,
ranging from cracker wrappings to appliance containers, and
including envelopes that require tools to open, belong on many
lists, if not theirs.
   But it suggests that the diversity of lists merely proves the
point that there are so many of these little irritants swarming
through our service society that they are serving to create a major
problem.

<HEAD>Welcome to Washington, Murder Capital of the USA</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's the capital of the free world and the
murder capital of the United States.
   Just one night last week, three people were killed in the
District of Columbia. Typically, all were shootings and all, police
said, could be drug-related.
   By Wednesday, 75 people had been killed this year in Washington,
compared with 46 by the same time in 1988. Last year set a city
record with 372 homicides _ virtually one a day and 145 more than in
1987.
   At the current rate, the city could log more than 600 murders
this year.
   The pace of the killings in 1988 _ 59.4 for each 100,000
residents _ gave Washington a distinction it didn't want: Murder
Capital USA. Detroit, which held the title in 1987, had 58 murders
per 100,000 residents.
   Why Washington?
   Police officers and experts agree: handguns and a sudden influx
of cheap drugs.
   Both are easy to come by and both are increasingly finding their
way into the hands of young Washingtonians, many of whom have become
armed delivery people caught in wars between drug gangs.
   Ten of the 42 people killed in October were teen-agers. Seven
more were in their early 20s.
   It wasn't always so.
   ``Washington didn't become a target for the drug trade as early
as other large cities did,'' said Gwynne Peirson, a retired
criminology professor at Howard University who spent 23 years as a
police officer in Oakland, Calif. ``It's a relatively recent
phenomenon here because the population of Washington isn't the size
of many other cities, so it wasn't as attractive a market
initially.''
   That changed with the coming of crack, a highly potent and
addictive _ but cheap to get hooked on _ form of cocaine that can be
smoked.
   A typical dose of 100 milligrams, which a regular user might
smoke a dozen or more times a day, sells on the street for about
$10, said Maurice Hill of the Drug Enforcement Administration. A
75-milligram ``starter'' dose often goes for $5.
   ``The average kid with an allowance can buy crack unimpeded,''
said Mario Perez, a DEA agent. ``All he has to do is shake hands
with his best buddy outside the school house.''
   One expert said the very nature of crack has driven up the murder
rate.
   ``There's something about the nature of crack that makes people
crazy, makes them impulsive and likely to do irrational things,''
said Hubert Williams of the Police Foundation, a research
organization.
   ``I've heard crack addicts say use of crack opens up every
pleasure center in the body,'' said Williams, who was a police
officer for 24 years in Newark, N.J. ``The sensations are so high
and also so short in terms of duration that almost after taking the
first one, you need a second one because you're on a downer. So you
have an ideal set of circumstances to create a huge market.''
   Then there is the presence of guns.
   Ten to 20 years ago, high school students might have carried pen
knives as protection. Today, said a city officer who requested
anonymity, the protection is a handgun, often an automatic.
   ``We have people who are settling their arguments with guns,'' he
said.
   Of the almost 1,600 weapons seized by police since late 1986
through Operation Clean Sweep, an undercover operation aimed at drug
dealers, more than 1,200 have been handguns.
   To all that, add the high unemployment rate among the city's
black teens. In 1987, the last full year for which statistics are
available, 22.4 percent had looked for legitimate work, but failed.
   ``It's an easy market with so many poor, unskilled black people
willing to take the small risk,'' Peirson said. ``With people that
are uneducated and unskilled, the idea of standing out on a street
making $500 to $1,000 a night with the chances of getting caught
relatively small, it's a small risk.''
   Teen-agers and even younger children are being recruited to man
the front lines on the drug battleground ``because the
narco-traffickers know full well that we live in a society that
treats children as children,'' Perez said. ``They shield themselves
by the children, who become targets of opportunity for other
competitors. ... Most of the people being killed have barely begun
to shave.''
   Often these couriers work for one of the rival gangs of black
Americans, Jamaicans, Nigerians and Latins battling for the same
turf, said Perez.
   ``If there was something organized, maybe the (number of
homicides) would be placated somewhat,'' he said.
   ``These are people who collect their bills one way or the
other,'' Perez added. ``They are very unforgiving for the slightest
error or what seems to be betrayal. ...
   ``These people are presently jockeying for position, establishing
areas of control, fighting for turf. They're very very violent. Get
off my sand dune and stay off my sand dune.''

   What to do about the spiraling murder rate _ and the root
problems of drugs and guns among the city's young _ has so far
eluded officials.
   Operation Clean Sweep has resulted in close to 44,000 arrests,
but one officer said, ``We're arresting the same people, over and
over.'' Besides the arrests, officials say, the undercover effort
has netted 458 seized vehicles, $2.15 million in cash and drugs with
a street value of $16.7 million.
   Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. cited budget problems when the program
was reduced in November, but some police union officials say the
effort has virtually ceased in the worst crime areas.
   Peirson contends merely arresting and sentencing street dealers
won't do much good.
   ``They can do prison standing on their heads,'' he said,
remembering a conversation with a prison warden in Morgantown, W.Va.
   ``She pointed out that 90 percent of them (the inmates) when they
arrived had never seen a dentist, had never seen an eye doctor. Now
they had doctors, three meals a day, as much as they wanted. This is
not the kind of punishment that's going to deter them.''
   The mayor, himself involved in a federal investigation of his
personal and professional life, said after last week's three-murder
night that ``the only thing I can do is give people hope that I'm
doing what I can. (The people) want ideas. They want programs. They
want action.''
   Yet, his proposed budget would give the Police Department just 5
percent more in 1990.
   Rather than more money, Barry thinks the department can do better
with what it has.
   ``In the short run,'' said mayoral spokesman John White, ``he has
asked the Police Department to study the way in which it has
assigned its manpower so that more police officers will be on the
street rather than inside on administrative duties. The mayor
believes the size of the police force is sufficient, but there needs
to be better allocation of resources than we have.''
   Not everyone on the city council agrees with Barry's approach.
   ``People are outraged,'' said Councilwoman Nadine Winter. ``I'm
telling him he doesn't have it under control. He ought to call for
help.''
   Winter would have President Bush declare a state of emergency and
``deploy every available resource,'' even the National Guard, as
part of the battle.
   For its part, the White House, through press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater, said last week that ``everyone in the country, including
the president, is outraged by the homicides whether it be in
Washington, D.C., or California or anywhere else.''
   ``There are any number of appropriate solutions to this kind of
problem,'' Fitzwater said. ``The most obvious is for stepped-up law
enforcement.''
   Most of the drug-related shootings have been in the Southeast and
Northeast quadrants of the city, where a majority of its poor, black
residents live. But some have spilled over into largely affluent
Northwest Washington.
   Less than 1{ miles from the White House, drug dealers peddle
their wares along a corridor from 13th to 16th streets, NW.
   Diplomats at the Spanish Embassy on 15th Street, NW, are wary of
their neighborhood.
   ``This area ... is well known for being a center strongly related
to drugs and violence,'' said embassy spokeswoman Helga Soto.
``Consequently, the members of our embassy do not feel secure at all
when entering or leaving the premises.''
   So far, the violence hasn't dissuaded tourists, who average about
19 million a year, from coming to town, said Austin Kenny, executive
vice president of the Washington Area Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   ``The only people asking questions (about violence in the city)
are reporters,'' Kenny said.

<HEAD>Anti-Americanism: A Minority View Perhaps, But No Longer a Whisper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY TUNNEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-American protesters are
challenging South Korea's policies toward the United States and
sparking more U.S. criticism here than at any time in four decades.
   From student radicals yelling ``Yankee Go Home'' to farmers
denouncing U.S. agriculture imports, South Koreans are venting their
frustration and anger at one of their oldest allies.
   When President Bush visits Seoul next Monday, he will find what
one newspaper warns is a society ``quite different'' from the one he
saw as vice president in April 1982.
   ``Don't Come to Korea, Bush!'' yell radical students, punctuating
the words with raised, clenched fists.
   Criticism of the United States is no longer relegated to private
conversation. American flags are torched and effigies of Uncle Sam
or Bush are burned.
   Some 12,000 angry farmers battled thousands of riot police with
clubs and firebombs outside the National Assembly this month and
denounced the United States for trying to force open South Korea's
agricultural market.
   Radical students staged a series of attacks on U.S. facilities to
demand an end to American influence. They vowed to hold nationwide
anti-government, anti-U.S. demonstrations to coincide with the
president's visit.
   ``Arson, violence, destruction and lawlessness cannot be
tolerated,'' said President Roh Tae-woo in demanding an end to
protests.
   Every U.S. president since the Korean War except Richard Nixon
has visited Seoul but none has come during a time of more public
animosity against Washington policies.
   Businessmen, laborers, and students who have never thrown a
firebomb are heard to complain that South Korea is victimized by
unfair trade pressures and rude, Yankee arrogance.
   When asked their nationality by a Korean, U.S. citizens rarely
acknowledge that they are American. The U.S. embassy and the U.S.
military have cautioned citizens against wearing clothing which
labels them from the U.S.A.
   ``The United States is no longer a sacred cow,'' said a western
diplomat, requesting anonymity. ''America is no longer the patron
saint of South Korea.''
   ``The United States has played roles in past dictatorial
governments and we oppose the visit of U.S. President Bush,'' claims
a labor alliance demanding investigations into corruption and human
rights abuses of the past U.S.-supported authoritarian government.
   A few weeks ago, the United States said it was considering
closing its cultural center in the provincial capital of Kwangju,
180 miles south of Seoul, because of repeated violent attacks and
concern for the safety of its staff.
   Kwangju was the scene of a bloody nine-day civil uprising in
1980. Many opposition and dissident figures claim the United States
shared responsibility for the Kwangju incident by acquiescing in a
military-backed South Korean government plan to quell the uprising.
The United States denied the charge.
   Although public protests appear outwardly to have scant impact on
relations and radicals have little public support, government
leaders warn that growing anti-American sentiment could endanger
South Korea's interests in Washington.
   The government lost no time in apologizing publicly for the
Kwangju center attacks and appealed to radical students ``not to
damage traditional Korea-U.S. friendship.''
   The assistant foreign minister, Kim Suk-kyu, reflects the
thinking of many when he says anti-Americanism ``is a minority view
and a passing phenomenon, despite loud voices and anti-American
activists.''
   More than half of South Korea's 40 million people have been born
since the Korean War ended 35 years ago, and long time observers
link the intensity of anti-American feeling to the age of the
participant. The younger the person, the more likely he or she is to
feel the United States has taken its relationship with South Korea
for granted.
   The Korean peninsula has been divided into the capitalist south
and the communist north since the end of World War II in 1945. The
United States helped South Korea fight the 1950-53 Korean War
against the north and keeps 42,000 troops stationed in the south
under a mutual defense pact.
   Radical students and dissidents feel the presence of U.S. troops
stand in the way of unification talks with the north and have
demanded the withdrawal of all U.S. forces. They also demand the
halt to this year's joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises called
``Team Spirit.''
   A more realistic relationship is needed between the two
governments, say both protesters and some politicians, a
relationship which recognizes South Korea's economic potential and
place in global politics.
   The United States is Seoul's leading trade partner. Korea sold
America goods worth $8 billion more than it bought from the United
States last year. Considerable pressure has been placed on the
Koreans to liberalize their import regulations to help balance the
deficit.
   Anti-American comment became acceptable socially after last
fall's Olympic Games when South Koreans of all ages had their
frustration and resentment against the United States stoked by what
they regarded as unruly behavior of U.S. athletes and biased
coverage by NBC.

   Here are brief sketches of some of the places that President Bush
will visit during his 5{-day trip to three Asian capitals, beginning
Wednesday.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TOKYO</NOTE>
<NOTE>The Okura Hotel</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush will spend two nights in the hotel, most likely in the
Imperial Suite used by then President Reagan during the 1986
economic summit. The hilltop site of the 27-year-old hotel was owned
by the noble Okura family, which had run one of the big pre-war
industrial combines called zaibatsu.
   The 888-room hotel, across the street from the U.S. Embassy and
ambassador's residence, just finished a three-year refurbishment
last September. The management says the U.S. delegation is taking
about 400 of the Okura's rooms, and 13 other foreign delegations to
the funeral of Emperor Hirohito also will be housed there.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Akasaka Palace</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The palace, where Hirohito spent part of his young manhood and
early married life before he ascended the throne in 1926, was
completed in 1909 to be the crown prince's residence, and was such a
grand building that the Meiji Emperor (1868-1912) was said to be
unwilling to visit it.
   Modeled on the palace at Versailles and the Louvre, Akasaka
Palace is a grand example of architecture in the late Meiji period
when Japan, then emerging in a rush from feudal isolation, was
trying to outdo the West. Most of the building materials and
furnishings were imported.
   The palace, which sits in its own large park, was restored in the
1970s and now is used as a guesthouse for foreign dignitaries and to
hold major conferences, such as the 1986 economic summit. Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita will host a reception there following the
Hirohito funeral.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Imperial Palace</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The main ceremonial building within the moated, 284-acre palace
grounds in the center of Tokyo, the Imperial Palace was built in
1968 to replace a structure lost in a World War II firestorm caused
by U.S. bombing.
   The palace grounds include ponds, moats and forests as well as
administrative buildings and the Fukiage Mansion where Hirohito
lived through his final illness.
   The moats, walls and some structures date from the 17th century,
when the whole complex was called Edo Castle, the fortified
headquarters of the Tokugawa Shogunate that then ruled Japan from
Edo, the old name of Tokyo.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Shinjuku Imperial Gardens</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The site of the Hirohito funeral services, the park once served
as the garden for the imperial household. In mid-April, it becomes
one of the favorite places in Tokyo for people to picnic under what
seem to be clouds of cherry blossoms.
   A sanctuary has been constructed for the funeral, as well as two
tents 482 feet long to shelter 10,000 Japanese and foreign
dignitaries from the February weather.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>BEIJING</NOTE>
<NOTE>Great Hall</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   This cavernous, Soviet-style hall of beige-colored stone was
built in less than a year for the celebration of the communist
government's 10-year anniversary in 1959. It sits on the west side
of Beijing's broad Tienanmen Square in the traditional heart of the
city, and is the site for all major gatherings, including Communist
Party conferences and legislative sessions.
   Bush, like other state visitors, will come here for his official
red-carpet greeting, including cannon volleys and gifts of flowers
from small children who jump up and down and shout in sing-song,
``Warm welcome.''
   The president also will be toasted by China's top leaders at a
Great Hall banquet. The central banquet hall, with a two-story-high
ceiling, can sit 5,000 people and often does. But it is a long way
from the basement kitchen, and food often arrives cold.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Zhongnanhai</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Meaning ``the Central and South Seas,'' Zhongnanhai is a 213-acre
compound embracing two large lakes that used to be part of the
imperial palace grounds. It now serves as Communist Party
headquarters, and many visiting leaders, including Bush, are taken
behind its well-guarded vermillion walls to meet with party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   In the past, many top leaders also lived in Zhongnanhai, although
the current leaders are believed to live most of the time in their
own homes. A small portion of Zhongnanhai is open to Chinese
tourists as a park, but remains closed to foreigners.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Chongwenmen Christian Church</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush is expected to attend services at this Protestant church
hidden behind high stone walls along a narrow hutong, or alley. The
stone church built by missionaries with a round, dark-wood vaulted
ceiling usually is filled to capacity on Sundays with about 1,500
people, making it one of the largest of Beijing's six Protestant
churches.
   It was being used as a factory when Bush lived in Beijing as the
U.S. envoy. Like all other churches and temples, its religous
functions were halted during the radical leftist Cultural Revolution
of 1966-76, when religion was banned. It reopened as a church in
1983.
   During the ban on religion, however, the pastor, the Rev. Kan
Xueqing, was ordered by the government to hold Sunday services for
the small foreign community. The Bushes attended, and in 1975 Kan
baptized their daughter, Dorothy, then 16.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Diaoyutai State Guesthouse</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese antiques, a king-sized bed, gold-plated plumbing and an
electric massage chair are among the accommodations awaiting Bush in
this elegant, high-security government hotel.
   Diaoyutai, ``the fishing terrace'' covering 100 acres of park,
served as a retreat for emperors more than 800 years ago. The
communist government built guest villas there in 1959 to accommodate
the many foreign leaders visiting on the 10th anniversary of the
communist takeover.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA</NOTE>
<NOTE>The Blue House</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The house and its auxiliary facilities have been used as the
nation's presidential residence since the first Republic of Korea
was formed in 1948, and is now the home of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Built in 1927 by Japanese colonial rulers, the big two-story
granite structure derives its name from its tiled roofs, which are
painted blue. It is on a mountainside north of the city center, near
the remaining royal palaces of the Chosun Dynasty kings, who ruled
Korea for five centuries. The U.S. military administration used the
Blue House as its headquarters for three years after Korea was
divided in 1945.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The National Assembly</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly building, home of South Korea's unicameral
legislative body, is a domed six-story structure surrounded by
granite columns said to symbolize the harmony of diverse opinions of
the Korean people.
   The assembly building was constructed in 1975 on an island in the
Han River, which runs through the capital city. Bush made a speech
at the National Assembly during his visit in April 1982 as vice
president.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Yongsan garrison</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The garrison is headquarters for the Combined Forces Command, the
U.S. Forces Korea, the U.S. 8th Army and the United Nations Command,
and serves as operational control center for the 42,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   Located on 714 acres south of central Seoul, the garrison was
used as the Japanese Imperial Army headquarters until after World
War II. It has 20.4 miles of paved roads, 1,225 buildings and homes
for more than 6,000 families and military personnel. There are
stores, theaters, schools, a hospital, fire station and power plants
_ a city within a city.

<TEXT>
   Chinese artists and intellectuals are pushing back
state-set limits on creativity and expression, setting off the
widest debate on politics, art and culture in a decade.
   From a television program on the collapse of China's culture to
an exhibition of avant-garde art to poetry readings in dingy
dancehalls, intellectuals in Beijing are diving through a small
window of opportunity to call for political, social and economic
change.
   ``None of us knows how long this will last,'' said Yang Wei, a
self-described ``free'' artist. ``But it's a good time to be
creating.''
   Criticism of the government and the Communist Party, long
relegated to the privacy of one's home, has become more open.
   ``China is in crisis _ political, economic and cultural,'' said
Su Shaozhi, a leading Marxist theorist, during a talk at one of
several study groups that have opened recently. ``We need to
democratize this society to allow the people to supervise the party
and the government.''
   Many say the government is too preoccupied with its economic
troubles to worry about the current foment in intellectual life.
   Inflation in China has hit its highest level since the Communist
took power in 1949, reaching an official rate of almost 20 percent.
Economists say it is actually twice as high.
   Corruption is widespread and the state-run press has recently
acknowledged increases in prostitution, strikes and drug smuggling.
   ``With all this chaos, the higher-ups don't really have time to
watch over us bookworms,'' said Fei Dawei, an art critic at the
Central Academy of Fine Arts. ``As long as we don't ask for money,
they don't ask too many questions.''
   Others say the authorities may not take the intellectuals'
activities seriously or may believe they haven't become widespread
enough to justify a crackdown. Indeed, so far, only a small, but
vocal, fraction of China's intellectuals are taking part.
   A minority views the relaxation as a ploy by conservatives to
create more chaos in society and provide an excuse for new
repression. But this perspective is not popular.
   ``It doesn't take into account that the Chinese people have
changed,'' said Hou Hanru, a philosopher also at the fine arts
academy. ``The people aren't listening to the government anymore. If
it yells again, nobody will follow.''
   It also doesn't take into account the spontaneity of the change.
   Previous thaws were ordered or supported from above. The Hundred
Flowers Movement of 1956 in which intellectuals were encouraged to
criticize the Communist Party was apparently masterminded by
Chairman Mao Tse-tung to identify heretical thinkers. Many of those
who spoke out during the brief thaw were purged from the party and
arrested.
   The most recent period of relative intellectual freedom _ the
Democracy Wall movement of 1978 which called for political freedoms
_ was allowed by Chinese leaders, including the newly emerged top
leader Deng Xiaoping, in an attempt to justify their plan for
widespread political and economic reform. When the movement
outlasted its utility its leaders were jailed.
   An early sign of the newest thaw came last summer when the
six-part series ``River Die Young'' ran on national television twice
to an audience of hundreds of millions.
   As it discussed China's fascination with dragons, ``River Die
Young'' criticized the Chinese people's willingness to bow to
authority. As it described the Yellow River, which has changed its
course many times in the past, killing millions of people, the
program questioned Communist China's turbulent history.
   ``Watching `River Die Young,' we discovered that what our
teachers taught us was false,'' wrote one high-school viewer to
screen writer Su Xiaokang. ``You showed us China's weaknesses.''
   Another sign came in November in the small but well-respected
journal ``Economic Research.'' Three economists from the Academy of
Social Sciences called for the abandonment of public ownership, the
bedrock of the socialist system, and the institution of a private
property system.
   ``Our goal is to liberate the Chinese people,'' said one of the
theorists, Hua Sheng. ``Social justice, the right of
self-realization, is the essence of socialism, and that has nothing
to do with state control.''
   Neither has politics been immune.
   On Jan. 28, a group of political theorists gathered in the
basement of a private bookstore to discuss a new periodical, ``New
Enlightenment.''
   In its first two editions, the booklet advocates political
transformation.
   ``The time has come for intellectuals to form a pressure group to
force the government to change,'' Fang Lizhi, China's best-known
dissident, told the meeting. Fang has called for multiparty
democracy and greater respect for human rights in China.
   Literature, especially poetry, has also blossomed in the form of
small reading groups where authors and poets gather to share their
works.
   One such meeting was held Jan. 29 in a run-down dancehall in
eastern Beijing. About 30 members of the group, ``Silent Night,''
gathered for an afternoon of poetry, discussion and music.
   ``Writing in this society is very lonely work,'' said one poet at
the meeting. ``We meet like this to cut the pain.''
   But like the current political debate, these poetry readings have
yet to reach the ordinary man.
   Art, however, has.
   In December, the first exhibition of nude paintings, banned for
decades under the puritanical policies of the Ministry of Culture,
opened in Beijing. About 200,000 people saw it.
   On Feb. 5, artists defied a ban on performance art during the
first exhbition of avant-garde art at the China Art Gallery, the
nation's main museum.
   One artist fired two BBs into her sculpture _ a telephone booth.
Another sold shrimp to protest ``the commercialization of art.''
   Authorities closed the show for five days and allowed it to
re-open on the condition that the artists would respect the ban.
   But despite the restrictions, many artists said things had
changed for the better.
   ``In the past, we wouldn't have challenged the ban,'' said one of
the ``performers.'' ``And once they closed the show, they would have
closed it for good. Now we're pushing them.''
   The new thaw raises questions for China's rulers as artists and
intellectuals continue to stretch the boundaries of what is
permissible. Will the rulers continue to ignore the change and
concentrate on the economy? Or is another crackdown coming?
   ``We are living in a contradiction,'' said one writer. ``As
patriots we want the economy to be strong, but as intellectuals its
weakness allows us to create.''

   Trucks and barges pile 52 million pounds of
paper, cans, plastic and other trash daily onto a Staten Island
dump, building the world's biggest mountain of garbage toward a
height rivaling the skyscrapers across the bay in Manhattan.
   Much of that could be recycled, and New York officials have begun
considering a plan to do so. Elsewhere, more and more communities
are already recycling the trash their citizens throw out.
   They have little choice. While the New York dump is planned to
operate 11 more years, a third of the nation's 6,000 garbage dumps
are expected to shut within five years, forcing communities to find
new ways to dispose of their garbage.
   Every American man, woman and child generates 3.5 pounds of
refuse a day _ adding 160 million tons to the nation's trash pile
each year.
   That pile holds 42 percent paper, 23 percent food and yard waste,
9.4 percent glass, 9.2 percent metals, 6.5 percent plastics, and 9.4
percent other materials, according to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
   Ten states already require _ or soon will require _ residents to
separate newspapers, glass jars, milk cartons, tin cans or other
discarded items for recycling trucks or bins. Legislators in 33
states are expected to consider plans to increase recycling this
year.
   ``People don't want incinerators or dumps near them, so they are
beginning to force their elected officials to start recycling
programs,'' said Cynthia Pollock Shea, a senior researcher at
Worldwatch Institute, a non-profit organization that studies
environmental issues.
   Recycling is not new in the United States. During World War II,
``everybody recycled,'' said Barry Commoner, director of Queens
College's Center for the Biology of Natural Systems. ``People even
recycled rubber bands and string.''
   But the efforts to conserve mostly ended with the war. Now only
10 percent of the nation's garbage is recycled, compared to as much
as 60 percent by some cities in Europe and Japan.
   Studies say as much as 86 percent of household trash could be
recycled, and EPA has set a goal of recycling 25 percent in four
years.
   The process of recycling is simple: separating usable products
from the trash; processing them so they can be substituted for more
expensive raw materials at manufacturing plants; and returning them
to the marketplace as parts of new products.
   It has not been so easy to put into effect. Some communities have
had trouble finding buyers for discarded newspapers, glass or
plastic; recycling programs require start-up funds; and, perhaps
most importantly, people's habits of throwing trash into only one
can be difficult to change.
   Still, experts predict recycling will eventually become a part of
the everyday infrastructure of cities and towns.
   ``Today, trash trucks dominate waste hauling,'' said Peter
Grogan, director of material recovery for R.W. Beck and Associates,
which has helped dozens of communities start recycling programs.
``But by the year 2010, we're going to see as many recycling trucks
as dump trucks, recycling centers as common as video shops ... and
recycling introduced in lesson plans in schools across the country.''
   Among the communities now making it easier for residents to
recycle trash, several are considered international models:
   _Hamburg, N.Y., a Buffalo suburb, started a program in 1981 and
now claims 98 percent of its 3,350 households participate. ``Unless
they want to eat their garbage, they better separate it or we won't
pick it up,'' said Ann Kankolenski, a public works department
employee. She said 34 percent of the trash is recycled and nearly
all the rest burned.
   _Seattle residents already recycled 24 percent of their garbage
before the city started its program last year and the city is aiming
for 60 percent in 10 years. Even steel garbage cans are being
recycled.
   _Wilton, N.H., officials say a voluntary six-town program in
southwestern New Hampshire has 70 percent participation. Started a
decade ago, the program recycles 42 percent of the garbage brought
to a center, burns 47 percent and buries 11 percent.
   Even more is possible.
   Connie Leach, Vermont's recycling director, feeds her food scraps
to worms.
   ``They eat everything up,'' Leach said of the little red worms
that are covered with peat moss in a basement box lined with plastic
and newspapers. The worms' digestive system allows them to eat the
food quickly and so far it hasn't attracted cockroaches or mice.
``I've been very surprised at how well it works,'' she said.
   Leach, named Recycler of the Year in 1987 by the National
Recycling Coalition, doesn't stop there. She recycles all her
household waste except for some types of plastics, junk mail on
high-grade paper and light bulbs. In a month, she throws out only
two small bags.
   Ed Steyh, Seattle's administrator of garbage and recycling
contracts, also goes to great lengths to recycle his trash.
   He lives on an island in Puget Sound, where he can recycle only
tin cans. So, on his ferry rides to work he takes newspapers, glass,
aluminum cans and other items.
   ``I bring them to my in-laws and they recycle it with their
things,'' Steyh said.
   Solid waste management companies also are expanding into
recycling, creating more markets for recycled materials.
   ``Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon,'' said Darlene Snow,
recycling director for the National Solid Waste Management
Association, which represents 2,500 companies that handle half of
the nation's household waste and 95 percent of its industrial waste.
   She said the industry approached recycling warily. ``They had a
routine, a routine without a lot of regulations. Then all these
(state) laws came,'' she said. ``What happened was that haulers
nationwide were losing business to recycling.''
   Now, industry seminars on the topic are full, she said.
   The recycling movement also has put in jeopardy some proposed
trash-to-energy incinerators. Planned incinerators have been shelved
in Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia and Austin, Texas.
   Incinerators have been touted as a way to produce energy and
reduce the amount of garbage, but questions persist about the affect
on air quality and on the disposal of the byproduct of ash laced
with toxins.
   In 1983, New York City proposed what would be the world's largest
trash-to-energy incineration system. The project, which still needs
federal and state permits, faces stiff opposition from
environmentalists and neighborhood groups.
   Environmentalists say the solution to the city's garbage crisis
should be aggressive recycling. Their goals are 60 percent in 10
years, 90 percent in 20 years. Currently, the city recycles less
than 1 percent of its trash.
   However, under legislation proposed earlier this month in New
York City, mandatory recycling would be phased in over five years.
   ``The debate has now changed from, `What are we going to do about
the garbage crisis?' to `How much can we recycle?''' said David
Antonioli, a staff member with the New York Public Interest Research
Group. ``The Earth is not a dump.''

   Mountains of scrap tires are being eroded by
entrepreneurs who are cutting them up for fuel, mixing them with
asphalt to extend highway life and using them to soften airport
runways.
   The pioneers are seeking profitable ways to recycle discarded
tires and remove a huge trash problem. An estimated 240 million
tires are added to the highly flammable heaps each year.
   Some tires are recycled the old-fashioned way, by retreading, but
only 20 percent are suited for that use. A few get new life as
buffers for marine and truck loading docks. Some end up in the
backyard as tire swings.
   But most tires just piled up until business people and scientists
recently stepped up efforts to find new uses.
   In Cleveland, for instance, a company is experimenting with
chopped up tires as a fuel additive in coal-fired boilers to see if
they can reduce acid rain, and scrap tires are being used as
components in septic tank systems.
   For some, finding new uses for scrap tires ``is like (hauling)
garbage _ you get paid to take it in and get paid to make it into a
fuel,'' said Anderson B. Carothers, chairman of Waste Recovery Inc.
   His company uses scrap tires as a supplemental fuel at three
wood-processing plants.
   ``We compete against oil in the Northwest, against gas in
Louisiana, and, in the Southeast, we're competing against coal,''
Carothers said.
   Waste Recovery spent $2 million apiece on plants in Portland,
Ore., Houston and Atlanta, each capable of burning 5 million tires a
year, but the company is not making money yet, Carothers said.
   Robert H. Snyder, former research director of Uniroyal, a
tiremaker that is now part of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co., spent much
of his career trying to build a better tire and now is working to
retire the mountains of leftovers.
   ``It's very clear to me that a scrap tire can very well pay for
its self-disposal,'' he contends.
   Snyder, a consultant in Detroit, said much of his current
research is confidential because he intends to seek patents. But he
said one new use is adding chopped bits of tires to speed up the
composting of sewage sludge.
   ``It's gathering a fair amount of momentum,'' Snyder said, citing
community programs in New Hampshipe and research at Rutgers
University in New Jersey and in U.S. Department of Agriculture
laboratories in Maryland.
   If each of the 250 sludge composting sites in the nation used
scrap tire chips instead of traditional wood chips to promote the
process, a three-year supply of scrap tires would be needed, Snyder
said.
   Another trend people in the business foresee is increasing state
and city regulation of scrap tire disposal. Carothers said disposal
costs range from 25 to 50 cents a tire depending on licensing and
transportation costs.
   Florida, for instance, began a 50-cent surcharge on each new tire
sale this year to finance disposal. The surcharge will double to $1
in 1990.

   Only days after arriving from Armenia,
9-year-old Karen Kocharian stood behind the grocery store cash
register, his bandaged right hand, maimed in an earthquake, tucked
in his jacket pocket. With his good hand he tried to help make
change in unfamiliar dollars and cents.
   The boy, waiting to be treated for injuries he suffered when the
quake last December shook down the walls of his school, smiled at
everyone who entered George and Annadid Ohanian's store.
   The couple, immigrants from the Soviet Unit the newspaper quoted one
source as
saying the report ould contain ``a wealth of allegations about the
guy's personal conduct.''
   Tom Kirk, the FBI agent who wrote the report, told the newspaper
the report will contain new information on Tower that has not been
made public.
   Tower has been dogged by allegations of drinking and
philandering. Many senators also have voiced concern about whether
Tower could avoid conflicts of interest after receiving more than $1
million as a consultant for major defense contractors since he left
the Senate four years ago.
   Nunn, whose committee is reviewing the nomination, has said that
an investigation of Tower's actions in Geneva found no security
breaches.
   He also said Wednesday that if members of the full Senate bring
up questions about Tower's personal life the lawmakers may be forced
to meet behind closed doors.
   ``I hope not, but it depends on the type of questions posed on
the Senate floor by senators who are not members of the Senate Armed
Services Committee,'' Nunn said, referring to the Senate
deliberations should the nomination clear his panel.
   ``I emphasize that the leadership of the Senate will make this
decision, not the Armed Services Committee or its chairman,'' he
said.
   A closed session of the full Senate occurs only about once a year
and usually relates to national security issues. The last occurred
on March 29, 1988, when the Senate discussed the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces Treaty with the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Poor Peruvians Find Fortune in Cocaine Town</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   This ramshackle jungle settlement has become
a boom town in Peru's illicit cocaine trade, luring thousands from
city shantytown or impoverished countryside with a promise of quick
fortune from the coca leaf.
   Pascual Mendieta came out of poverty in the village of La
Libertad three years ago, planted coca for awhile and now owns an
electronics store.
   Ten-year-old Daniel Aguilar was sent to Tocache by his mother to
shine shoes after his father died and now he earns enough money to
live on and send home.
   ``How am I going to deny I cultivate coca if it's growing all
around here as far as the eye can see,'' said David Buttgenbach, a
Peruvian of German descent who lost his job as a laborer when the
lumber company he worked for went bankrupt.
   ``Coca is paying for my six children to study in good schools in
Lima. Without coca my family would go hungry.''
   Landless peasants, the jobless from Lima, highland merchants,
Colombian drug dealers _ all have streamed into Tocache, swelling
its population from 10,000 in 1981 to 25,000 today.
   ``When I was working four years ago in a poor neighborhood in
Lima, you heard the name Tocache, Tocache, Tocache. Kids were coming
out here then to build airstrips for the drug traffickers,'' said
the Rev. Paul Feeley, a Canadian priest who now works in Aucayacu,
55 miles south of here.
   Operation Thunderbolt, a major police drive against cocaine
trafficking in the Upper Huallaga river valley in late 1987, put a
dent in the narcotics trade in Tocache. It forced the town's cocaine
boss, a gang leader known as ``The Vampire,'' to flee into the
jungle and dried up the flow of drug dollars. Sales in shops fell to
half their normal level.
   But the 250-man police force that seized control of Tocache from
an alliance of leftist guerrillas and cocaine smugglers has dwindled
to about 50 troopers today, and the town is regaining its gold-rush
atmosphere.
   New three- and four-story homes jut up against a backdrop of
jungled hills. Shops along Tocache's unpaved, muddy streets are
filled with color television sets, stereo systems and luxury items
like gold-plated lighters.
   The town's allure is reflected in a popular rock song, ``Going to
Tocache,'' which led Peru's top 10 musical hits for three months in
1988. Tocache's fame is such that Peruvians have coined a word,
``tocachization,'' to describe the explosive violence, corruption
and wild, lopsided prosperity of other jungle villages following in
its steps.
   Tocache once again is receiving a steady flow of
``narco-dollars'' from Colombian drug buyers who arrive in small
planes at clandestine runways in the jungle. The Colombians pick up
shipments of ``coca paste'' _ semi-refined cocaine made from the
leaves of coca bushes that cover mile after mile of hillsides in the
area.
   In Colombia the paste is refined into pure cocaine powder, which
is smuggled to the lucrative U.S. and European markets.
   The dollars to pay Peruvian coca farmers end up being trucked
over the Andes to a network of streetside money changers in Lima,
Peru's capital on the coast 300 miles to the southwest. Economists
estimate the cocaine trade pumps as much as $1.2 billion a year into
Peru's faltering economy, a sum equal to half the country's earnings
from legal exports.
   The appeal of ``narco-dollars'' has made Tocache and neighboring
settlements a promised land for some 200,000 peasants who have
migrated to the Upper Huallaga valley in the last two decades to
grow coca, a crop that pays 10 times as much as any other.
   It is illegal to grow coca in Peru without the permission of the
state coca company Enaco, which markets the leaves to drug companies
or distributes them for such uses as chewing and making tea. Enaco
says all of the coca in the Huallaga valley, where the vast majority
of Peru's coca leaf is cultivated, is illegal, but Peru lacks the
manpower, equipment and resources to stop it.
   The prosperity around Tocache is apparent even to the casual
observer. The jungle trails outside town pass house after house with
television antennas, refrigerators and gasoline generators for
power. Often motorcycles and four-wheel drive vehicles are parked
outside.
   Such acquisitions are luxuries in Peru, where most peasants
consider themselves fortunate to have a solid meal a day.
   Farmers are not the only ones to benefit from the coca bonanza.
   ``Everyone in this town, from the bigshot coca dealer to the
streetcorner ice cream vendor, lives off drug trafficking, either
directly or indirectly,'' says a police commander, speaking on
condition he not be identified by name.
   The sudden riches obtained by immigrants are resented by the
small number of townspeople who have not joined in the cocaine trade.

   School Superintendent William Tirado says bitterly the town's
teachers have become steadily poorer, while uneducated peasants from
the Andes have grown wealthy overnight.
   ``They arrived poor and have become rich while we, the teachers,
the ones with education, are poorer than ever,'' Tirado says. ``The
only ones who have failed to progress are those who have not
participated in this illicit business.''
   Police say most of Tocache's residents, including prosperous
merchants and bar keepers, continue cultivating coca outside of town
even after they make enough money to open legitimate businesses.
   Townspeople are suspicious of outsiders and most refuse to
acknowledge their direct involvement in the illegal, often deadly
enterprise of cocaine trafficking.
   Pascual Mendieta, 30, the owner of the electronics store, says he
stopped growing coca since opening his business.
   ``I planted a little coca and after two years I had enough money
to open this store,'' he said. ``Business has gone well. I have no
complaints.''
   Daniel Aguilar, the shoeshing boy, was in Tocache 12 hours after
his mother put him on a bus in the mountain town of Huanuco and not
long after that he was earning five dollars a day _ three times the
national minimum wage.
   ``I send money home to my mother each week so my brothers and
sisters can eat,'' he says proudly.
   Tocache's growth was made possible by the Jungle Highway, a
visionary project launched 25 years ago during the administration of
President Fernando Belaunde Terry to spur colonization of Peru's
virtually uninhabited tropical forests. The highway, running 1,000
miles north to south, hugs the lower eastern slopes of the Andes.
   ``The coca boom began when the jungle was opened up,'' says Edgar
Machado, a professor at the National Agrarian University in Lima and
an expert on coca. ``That was when the migration of landless
campesinos began. They were the pioneers of the jungle and the first
thing they did was plant coca as the most profitable crop
available.''
   Miguel Gonzalez, 33, manager of a small restaurant and one of the
few born here, recalls that when he was a boy, Tocache was a sleepy
village of several hundred farmers.
   ``People used coca to chew. They knew nothing about cocaine,'' he
says, referring to the centuries-old Andean tradition of chewing
coca leaves to dampen hunger and increase energy.
   Things began to change when drug-trafficking gangs, under
pressure from police, moved their base of operations to Tocache from
Aucayacu and Tingo Maria, the valley's biggest town, 80 miles south
of here.
   ``Since 1984 drug traffickers have been considered the upper
crust of Tocache society,'' School Superintendnent Tirado says with
an ironic chuckle. ``Moral values have been turned upside down.
Young people have lost all interest in studying. They want money,
and the quickest way to get money is to plant coca.''
   The biggest drug trafficker of all was ``The Vampire.'' He is
believed to still be in the area although he has not returned to
town.
   People say his name was fitting: He lived in a sprawling,
garishly decorated home with a blood-red ceiling and similarly
colored furniture. When he saw an attractive woman on the street, he
took her and if her companion was foolish enough to protest, he
killed him.
   The Vampire's favorite killing spot was the bridge over the
Huallaga River. Backed up by his henchmen, he would take his victims
there, drive a knife into their chests or shoot them through the
head and dump their bodies into the swift-flowing river, townspeople
say.
   ``I knew The Vampire,'' says Daniel, the shoeshine boy. ``He
lived in the `casa grande.' I shined his shoes. He gave me big tips
and joked with me. But when he was in a bad mood, he was mean.''

   When Mario Muelas leaves the construction
site in the winter twilight, he walks to his car through narrow
alleys where Christians, Moslems and Jews once rubbed shoulders.
Then he drives four centuries back home to Madrid.
   The 45-year-old architect is working in the vast 16th-century San
Pedro Martyr convent complex, drawing up and executing plans to turn
it into a modern government administrative center.
   ``Some days when I leave I feel like I'm emerging from the 15th
or 16th centuries, I don't know where I am,'' Muelas says, surveying
one of three cloistered patios that form the core of the former
Dominican convent that expanded to about the size of a soccer field
through the heart of Toledo as the Roman Catholic order grew in
power.
   The transformation of the convent, which has also served as an
army barracks, stables, home for the elderly and orphanage, is the
largest project yet undertaken in the preservation and restoration
of Toledo, a once strategic city on a hill whose origins go back to
the Roman colony of Hispania.
   Like Venice in Italy and Fez in Morocco, Toledo has been declared
part of the world's cultural patrimony by UNESCO, the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. And as in the
case of Venice and Fez, Toledo needs more than declarations to help
it remain a living city as well as a monumental symbol of a time
when three of the world's major religious cultures thrived together
on a rocky outcropping of the La Mancha plain.
   Rose-Anne Bartholomew, wife of U.S. Ambassador Reginald
Bartholomew, calls Toledo ``one of the places where three cultures
lived successfully,'' comparing the city's former mix to that of
Jerusalem and Beirut in their finer days.
   Mrs. Bartholomew is the only non-Spanish member of the Board of
Directors of the year-old Toledo Foundation, which seeks to mobilize
the interest, government support and independent financial backing
necessary to save the city. She hopes to set up a U.S. branch when
she returns to Washington when her husband leaves his post in Spain
this year.
   The group has just moved into its headquarters in a room at one
end of the medieval St. Martin bridge renovated by Toledo youths
employed at a restoration workshop school set up by the regional
government of Castille-La Mancha.
   Convents like San Pedro Martyr are a key element in the future of
Toledo. There are some 50 within the old, walled portion of the
city. Most were built to house at least 400 cloistered nuns each but
now have less than 20 inhabitants, most of whom are over 65.
   Since the Spanish state confiscated much of the church's property
in 1834, the convents have fallen on hard times.
   The rehabilitation of San Pedro Martyr _ Muelas says the
Dominicans meant it originally as an administrative center for some
aspects of the Spanish Inquisition when they opened it in 1540 _ is
budgeted at $10 million. The Spanish Interior and Economy ministries
are paying the bill, rather than building something new in Toledo's
industrial park across the Tagus River.
   Another convent, San Juan de la Penitencia, has been turned into
an international studies center for North and South American
students sponsored by the University of Minnesota and Spain's Jose
Ortega y Gasset Foundation.
   The center has served as the setting for several tri-cultural
congresses.
   Roman Catholics and Jews lived under Moslem rule when the Moors
incorporated Toledo into the Cordoba Emirate in 711 before it became
the capital of an independent Moorish kingdom in 1012. The city was
reconquered by a Christian king in 1085 and reached its glory under
the 1252-1284 reign of Alfonso X, the Wise.
   At the height of his rule, Toledo became the most important
Jewish center in Spain, a country known in Hebrew as Sepharad, from
which Sephardic Jews get their name. Moorish artisans using brick
construction, carved wood, sculpted plaster and painted tiles built
the Transito and Santa Maria la Blanca synagogues.
   Then, in 1492 Queen Isabella, in an effort to consolidate her
position on the Iberian Peninsula, signed an edict banishing all
Moslems and Jews from Spain.
   As part of the commemoration of the 500th anniversary in 1992 of
the first voyage of Christopher Columbus to the New World, the
Spanish government has declared Toledo the headquarters of Sepharad
92 and a symbol of Spain's ``re-encounter'' with its Jewish heritage.
   When Edgar Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress,
visited Toledo a year ago, Mayor Jose Antonio Molina told him the
old city needed $100 million over the next two decades to reverse a
depopulation trend that threatened to turn the city into a ghost
town filled with monuments and tourist shops.
   Of Toledo's 60,000 inhabitants, about 16,000 live inside the
city's Moorish walls where streets are only as wide as a person's
outstretched arms, parking is impossible and ``everyone knows what
you're doing,'' in the words of Steve Kennedy, an Englishman married
to a Spaniard who lived in the old city for six years.
   On evenings and weekends the main Zocodover Plaza fills with
people who come to gossip, drink a beer, or buy almond paste
marzipan, a Moorish-Jewish legacy and a Toledo speciality.
   Many of the dwellings in Toledo have been abandoned over the
years by squabbling heirs who don't want to live 42 miles from much
more up-to-date Madrid. Many are either palaces or hovels, too big
or too small for single families.
   Former Mayor Juan Ignacio de Mesa, a member of the foundation's
board of directors, is looking for a way to use state-of-the-art
technology to make a medieval city liveable.
   De Mesa is working with representatives of the city's major
industries _ Alcatel, Nixdorf and the Beecham and Jansen
pharmaceutical firms _ to solve mundane but pressing problems of
what to do with the elecrical and telephone lines that dangle in
clusters and crisscross narrow streets and the television antennae
that sprout from red-tile roofs.
   The Spanish government through the Ministry of Culture's
restoration department has earmarked 81.6 million pesetas ($710,000)
in 1989 for work on Toledo's magnificent 13th century cathedral, the
Tornerias mosque, Santa Maria la Blanca and the Santa Fe convent. A
similar sum was budgeted last year.
   The ministry's museums department spent an additional 33.3
million pesetas ($290,000) restoring the house of the painter El
Greco, the Transito and the Santa Cruz museum. The regional
government spent 70.1 million pesetas ($609,000).
   These amounts, De Mesa says, are but a drop in the bucket.
   The foundation is in the process of drawing up the first overall
plan to present to the Ministry of Culture on what has to be done to
establish what Mrs. Bartholomew calls ``the very fine balance
between a museum city and a city that lives.''
   Spanish government support for the plan is essential in
encouraging fund-raising from other sources, she adds.
   De Mesa says the lack of a specific plan has hindered
fund-raising from sources outside Spain, including American Jewish
groups that could be interested in the restoration of the city's old
Jewish quarter.

   Housing construction posted its biggest gain in
nearly a year during January, the government reported, but analysts
said the surge was due more to unusually mild weather than an upturn
in the market.
   Construction of new homes and apartments was up 8 percent in
January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.69 million units
after inching up 0.1 percent during December, the Commerce
Department said Thursday.
   It was the biggest monthly increase since an 8.6 percent rise in

   Despite assurances from President Bush that
deposits in troubled savings and loan associations will be
protected, a few small Texas thrifts are offering very high rates to
attract outside investors accustomed to getting a ``Texas premium.''
   In general, though, rates on deposits at big Texas thrifts are

   Most of the highest rates on regular deposits are now offered in

   A Federal Reserve Board decision that for the
first time penalizes a bank for failing to serve poor neighborhoods
appears to signal a new willingness by regulators to enforce a
12-year-old law against such practices, community activists said.
   The Fed rejected Thursday a request by Continental Bank Corp. to
purchase a small Arizona bank because it said Continental had not
fulfilled its duties under the Community Reinvestment Act, which
requires banks to meet local credit needs, including those in poor
neighborhoods.
   The law is aimed at preventing ``red-lining,'' the practice of
denying loans to an entire neighborhood based on the predominant
race or economic class of its residents.

<HEAD>Some Texas Thrifts Are Offering Extra-High Rates To Attract Deposits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF AWALT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although the ``Texas premium'' is not as big as it
used to be, some of the state's smaller, weaker thrifts are chasing
after depositors with rates so high that federal regulators have
become concerned.
   Texas thrifts account for 11 of the top 25 yields available on
six-month jumbo certificates of deposit, according to 100 Highest
Yields, a publication in North Palm Beach, Fla.
   Ten of the Texas 11 are rated financially weak or insolvent,
making them least able to afford the high rates they pay depositors.
Their actions could add to the cost to taxpayers of the Bush
administration's proposed $90 billion bailout, the government says.
   ``Paying a premium rate has an effect on the total cost to the
government in resolving these insolvencies and, in the meantime,
others in the region have to compete with these insolvent
institutions,'' Alan Whitney, spokesman for the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., said in an interview Thursday.
   The ``jumbo'' certificates of deposit are sold in units of
$100,000, meaning the buyers tend to be institutions or wealthy
individuals who are on the lookout for high yields backed up by
federal insurance.
   ``A few weak (thrift) institutions still continue to play the
hot-money game,'' said Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate
Monitor, a publication affiliated with 100 Highest Yields.
   Aside from the relatively small number of high payers, rates on
deposits at big Texas thrifts are today only slightly above the
national average, a change from the days when the state's S&amp;Ls had
to pay a big ``Texas premium'' to attract deposits.
   Most of the highest rates on regular deposits are now offered in
the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, where there is strong loan
demand because of the healthier economy.
   ``The fact is that, in light of the president's statements and
other statements by the administration, there is no excess level of
risk in placing deposits in Texas institutions,'' Whitney said.
   The Bush administration's $90 billion proposal to rescue troubled
thrifts, many of them in Texas, was intended partially to close
those institutions that were driving up deposit rates for the rest
of the industry.
   But two insolvent Houston-area thrifts this week jacked up
interest rates as high as 10.75 percent for six-month jumbo CDs.
   The spike in rates, which already is subsiding, was described by
officials of high-bidding BancPlus Savings Association and
Commonwealth Savings as a temporary, cyclical cash drive for
mortgage operations.
   ``One of the primary objectives of the government is to stabilize
the situation, and it certainly doesn't lend stability when there
are rates out there of such size,'' said Douglas Valdetero,
executive vice president at Houston-based University Savings.
``There's no way you can buy that kind of money and turn it out and
make any profit on it.''
   University Savings tried to keep up with the increasing rates for
CDs, which were limited to deposits of $95,000-$100,000. The thrift
raised its six-month rate from 9.8 percent to 10.1 percent Monday
before dropping back the next day to 9.875 percent.
   Valdetero said the thrift retreated on its own from the rate
battle, but Whitney said University is under FDIC jurisdiction and
that the agency stepped in to reduce the rates.
   Commonwealth, meanwhile, boosted its rates to 10.75 percent from
about 9.3 percent. BancPlus was close behind at 10.65 percent, but
lowered its rate on the six-month deposits to 10.60 percent Thursday
and expected to drop still lower by Friday, spokesman Brendan Duffey
said.
   Commonwealth paid the highest rate in the nation for six-month
jumbo CDs as of Wednesday, at 10.75 percent, according to 100
Highest Yields.
   The rest of the top five were Sandia Federal Savings &amp; Loan of
Albuquerque, N.M., 9.85 percent; Resource Savings of Dallas, 9.80
percent; First Federal Savings and Loan of Colorado Springs, Colo.,
9.80 percent; and Fidelity Federal Savings Bank of Corinth, Miss.,
9.80 percent.
   The list is for institutions of all sizes.
   As for the bigger thrifts, statistics from the 10 largest thrifts
in each of the 10 major U.S. cities showed Houston had an average
9.11 percent rate on jumbo CDs and Dallas averaged 9.10 percent,
compared to the national average of 8.97 percent.
   Rates in Detroit and Boston were even higher, at 9.26 percent.
Presumably the demand for loans is high enough in those cities that
their thrifts need to offer high rates to attract deposits that they
can then re-lend, Heady said.
   Reflecting the regional shift, a year ago, 75 of the nation's 100
top yields on regular, small-denomination CDs and money market
accounts were offered by Texas institutions.
   Only 10 to 12 Texas institutions remain on that list, while about
66 are from the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, Heady said.

   President Bush is disputing criticism that his
$1.16 trillion budget allows him to take credit for proposing
expanded social spending while sticking Congress with finding ways
to pay for it.
   ``It's a two-way street,'' Bush said as he vowed to make good on
his commitment to work with Congress on spending cuts.
   The president, who made the remarks on Thursday in an Oval Office
interview with a group of reporters, was to give yet another
out-of-town speech today promoting that fiscal 1990 spending plan.
   His talk at Washington University in St. Louis was his third
speech on the budget since he unveiled it a week ago before a joint
session of Congress. Bush made similar remarks to business leaders
in New Hampshire on Monday and to state legislators in South
Carolina on Wednesday.
   Today's address also was expected to stress volunteerism in the
private sector _ one of Bush's pet themes.
   Democratic critics have called Bush's budget vague on where he
would make between $9.6 billion and $11 billion in cuts to carry out
his commitments for new spending on domestic programs like
education, child care, the homeless and cleaning up the environment.
   ``I said ahead of time I didn't expect everybody would jump up
and down and say this is the greatest thing since sliced bread,''
Bush said on Thursday.
   But he rejected the notion that he had been deliberately vague in
the budget to put the onus on Congress alone for coming up with
unpopular spending cuts.
   ``Yes, there's a lot more detail that has to be hammered out. And
we will work with them to satisfy their interests, and find out what
they want. It's a two way street,'' Bush said.
   He said he was generally pleased with the reaction so far toward
both his budget plan and to his program to rescue the nation's
ailing savings and loans _ even though he conceded that the twin
plans weren't universally popular.
   Bush also denied anew any major policy rift with Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, even though they hold different views on
inflation and interest rates.
   ``It's one of the best fights in town,'' Bush said of battles
between a president and a Fed chief. ``You all love it, all
politicians love it, bankers like it, all editorialists for the Wall
Street Journal love it. But I want to avoid that because we aren't
far apart.''
   Greenspan's Fed has been nudging up short-term rates in recent
months in an effort to minimize inflation risks. Bush said Thursday:
``I don't see the inflationary pressures as so bad, or enough, to
warrant substantially higher interest rates.''
   Higher interest rates could the dampen economic growth that Bush
is counting on to produce government revenue gains assumed in his
budget.

   Share prices were near their morning lows in
lethargic trading at midday Friday, as the latest British inflation
figures came as little surprise to the market.
   The rise in the annual inflation rate to 7.5 percent in January
from 6.8 percent in the previous month had been foreshadowed by
comments last Saturday by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
Since the rise was expected by the markets, its impact was not
strong, dealers said.
   ``We would've liked to have seen lower numbers,'' one dealer
said, ``but one can only say they were as bad as had been expected.''
   By noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was down 14.4 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,019.4, a shade
better than its morning low of 2,019.3. Before the government's
release of the retail price figures, the market was 12.5 points
lower.
   Volume came to 234.7 million shares, compared with 426.4 million
shares at the same time Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Britain's annual inflation rate surged to 7.5
percent in January from 6.8 percent in the previous month, pushed to
its highest level in more than six years by higher mortgage rates,
the government said Friday.
   The Department of Employment said its retail price index rose 0.6
percent in January from the previous month.
   The index, which uses a 1987 base of 100, stood at 111 in
January, crease of 7.3 percent to 7.5 percent. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson warned last Saturday that the rise was likely
to be much above the 6.8 percent increase recorded for December.
   The 7.5 percent inflation rate is the highest since mid-1982.
   Share prices retreated on London's Stock Exchange on the news,
and the pound rose a bit. Trading in the markets was quiet.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 14.4
points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,019.4 after the report was released.
The index was 12.5 points lower before.
   The pound was quoted at $1.7785 vs. $1.7780 earlier.
   ``These figures do show very strong inflationary pressures,''
said Nigel Richardson, an analyst with the London investment firm
Rowe and Pitman, Mullins and Co.
   The department said the rise was mainly due to higher mortgage
interest payments, reflecting mortgage rate hikes made in January
following the late-November rise in the British commercial banks'
base rate to 13 percent from 12 percent.
   Excluding mortgage payments, the department said the annual
inflation rate was 5.5 percent.
   The government remains determined to bring inflation down, but
one consequence of using the higher interest rates as its weapon is
higher inflation in the short-term, the department said.
   The January increase also reflected higher food prices, motor
insurance premiums and rail fares, it said.

<HEAD>Fruehauf Says Loss Widened Due To 1986 Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debt and expenses from a 1986 leveraged buyout by
management of Fruehauf Corp. caused increased losses in the fourth
quarter and for 1988, the truck-trailer and auto parts maker says.
   Fruehauf on Thursday reported a net loss of $10.2 million, or
$1.39 a share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a
net loss of $6.1 million, or 84 cents a share, in the fourth quarter
of 1987.
   The losses came despite improved revenue, $557.0 million for the
quarter, up from $461.9 million for the year-earlier period, the
company said in a news release.
   For the year, Fruehauf said it had a net loss of $56.5 million,
or $6.50 a share, on revenue of $2.09 billion, compared with a net
loss of $41.5 million, or $5.97 a share, on revenue of $1.96 billion
in 1987.
   The company said it had long-term debt of $710 million on Dec.
31, though that was down from $794 million on Dec. 31, 1987, and
interest expenses of $101 million for 1988, reduced from $109
million the year before.
   Depreciation and amortization expenses as a result of the buyout
amounted to $113.5 million in 1988, down from $118.9 million in
1987, the company said.
   Its Kelsey-Hayes operation provided the only revenue increase for
the company.
   Fruehauf said revenue from automotive operations _ its
Kelsey-Hayes subsidiary's antilock braking systems and aluminum
wheels _ grew 21.5 percent, partly offset by costs of a new plant
and equipment.
   But the company said rising materials costs contributed to a 6.2
percent decline in trailer manufacturing revenue and a 19.4 percent
decline in revenue from its ship-repair facility in Jacksonville,
Fla.

<HEAD>Importer Disputes Domestic Producers' Steel Supply Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite claims by domestic producers of excess
steel production capacity worldwide, a leading importer says there
are shortages that justify a second look at U.S. steel trade quotas.
   U.S. steelmakers, demanding another five years of quotas, cite
excess world capacity of 100 million tons or more per year of steel
as the basis for cutthroat trading practices.
   ``I assure you most steel is imported into this market because it
fills specific needs of American steel users,'' said Erwin L. Klein,
a director and immediate past president of the American Institute
for Imported Steel.
   ``That may help dispel the notion most steel brought into this
country is foisted on American buyers by means of unfair trade
practices.''
   References to foreign production overcapacity as a cause of
problems for the U.S. steel industry may concern obsolete plants and
marginal product categories, Klein said in a speech prepared for
delivery Thursday night in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., to the
Association of Women in the Metals Industries.
   ``Though global surplus is widely discussed, we have all
encountered specific product shortages in the past year,'' said
Klein, who is also vice chairman of Steelinter USA Inc. of New York,
a major importer of Belgian steel.
   The shortages involve plate, large structural shapes and rod, he
said.
   The New York-based importers association says the Bush
administration should ease the steel import restrictions under the
five-year quota plan due to expire in September. Bush has promised
American producers to extend the protection.
   U.S. producers say another five years of quotas are necessary if
they are to fully recover from a near disasterous slump in their
industry from 1982-86. They accuse foreign steel producers,
especially those in Europe, of producing excess steel with
government subsidies to maintain employment in their countries.
   Klein said that since the early 1970s domestic steel buyers had
been forced to turn to foreign suppliers not only for particular
types of steel but also because total domestic steelmaking capacity
repeatedly had fallen short of demand.
   The shortfall was more than 20 million tons in 1988, and ``the
problem was especially acute in the West and Southwest, where
domestic production facilities were insufficient,'' he said.
   Importers have asked that Bush make any further quotas temporary
with a timetable for being phased out. They want quotas to be
voluntary and constantly adjusted to suit the needs of steel users.
   The importers also say semifinished steel products imported by
American producers should not be covered by the quota plan.
   The interests of steel-consuming manufacturers should get equal
consideration with those of the large steel producers, Klein said.
   Those steel-users ``create 25 times more value, employ 30 times
more workers and export nearly 100 times more in dollar terms than
the steel industry,'' he said.

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies in
Europe today after the U.S. government reported the country's trade
deficit narrowed in December.
   The U.S. Commerce Department said the December trade deficit
declined to $11.9 billion from a revised November figure of $12.2
billion. The November shortfall was originally reported at $12.5
billion.
   One Milan trader had said that there would be a greater tendency
to sell than buy the dollar should a neutral figure emerge from the
Washington report.
   This trader defined a neutral result as somewhere between $11
billion and $12 billion.
   Milan traders said there were far fewer ``dollar bulls'' in the
market than at the same time last week, due largely to mounting
opinion that the U.S. Federal Reserve was not about to hike U.S
interest rates, as many had been expecting.
   In London, the dollar improved against the British pound after
the trade report. It cost $1.7720 to buy one pound compared with
$1.7770 at midmorning and $1.7712 Thursday.
   Other dollar rates after the report was released with midmorning
rates in parentheses and compared with late Thursday's levels
included: 1.8440 (1.8350) West German marks, up from 1.8425; 1.5650
(1.5590) Swiss francs, up from 1.5643; 6.2685 (6.2500) French
francs, down from 6.2725; 2.0760 (2.0725) Dutch guilders, down from
2.0790; 1,344.00 (1,343.50) Italian lire, down from 1,348.50; and,
1.1918 (1.1875) Canadian dollars, up from 1.1859.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.61 yen to a closing 125.72. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 126 yen after the report and 125.75 yen before.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $378 a troy ounce, down
from $382.25 bid late Thursday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $378.95.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $379, down from $382.50 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.02 to close at a bid $380.18.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $5.80 a troy
ounce, down from Thursday's $5.84.

<HEAD>Searle Motion For New Trial Denied In $8.15 Million Copper-7 Verdict</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 6th graf, ``That flagrant ...' with background

   The $8.15 million awarded to a woman who
said a G.D. Searle &amp; Co. birth control device left her infertile was
not so ``shockingly excessive'' as to force a new trial, a judge has
ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Renner on Thursday denied the
company's motion for a new trial, which it had asked for on several
grounds, including juror misconduct, errors of evidence in the trial
and excessive punitive damages.
   A jury in September found in favor of Esther Kociemba's claim
that a Searle Copper-7 intrauterine device had triggered a pelvic
infection that left her infertile.
   ``This court simply cannot say that the verdict is so shockingly
excessive, in the light of evidence and Minnesota law, that the
court has grounds to force plaintiff to choose between a new trial
or a reduced amount of punitive damages,'' Renner said.
   Searle, which plans to appeal, said in a statement issued after
the ruling that it ``clearly believes that a new trial was warranted
based on the evidence of jury misconduct.''
   ``That flagrant misconduct occurred demonstrates the failure of
the judicial system to assure a fair trial for both parties as
required by federal law,'' the company said.
   Renner rejected the claims of misconduct after questioning jurors
in December. Three of the eight jurors had signed affidavits
alleging they were victims of verbal harassment and intimidation and
had been bullied into an ``unjust'' verdict by their fellow jurors.
The affidavits also said newspaper accounts of the trial had been
smuggled into the jury room.
   Attorneys for Kociemba presented evidence during the trial ``that
would have allowed a reasonable jury to conclude that (Searle)
knowingly placed millions of women ... at risk of serious infection,
loss of fertility and surgery for removal of internal organs,''
Renner ruled.
   About 500 lawsuits have been filed over the Copper-7, the most
widely used IUD in the United States before it was withdrawn from
the U.S. market in January 1986.

<HEAD>Teamsters Promise To Back Machinists In Event Of Eastern Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Atlanta's largest Teamsters local says
his union will honor machinists union pickets at Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport in case of a strike against Eastern Airlines.
   The strike could come March 3 unless talks that started 16 months
ago end in a settlement.
   Teamsters represent truckers at several major companies doing
business at the nation's second-busiest airport, including United
Parcel Service.
   Machinists President Michael J. Flynn said that Lamar Mathis,
trustee of Teamsters Local 928, has vowed ``a Teamster truck will
not cross our picket lines.''
   The impact of Machinist pickets would depend on whether courts
allow them to picket entire airports or limit them to Eastern
facilities. Teamsters represent a variety of employees at other
airlines, including drivers of airline fuel trucks.
   Eastern is seeking $150 million in concessions over each of the
next three years. The machinists have proposed a one-year wage
freeze and raises totaling 8 percent over the next two years.
   Federal mediators plan to convene negotiators for both sides in
Washington next week to try to avoid a walkout.

<HEAD>Kelly, Back In Takeover Game, Bids For Envirodyne</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock price of Envirodyne Industries Inc., a
Chicago manufacturer of sausage casings and plastics, has soared
following a takeover bid by former Beatrice boss Donald P. Kelly.
   Envirodyne jumped $4.50 a share to $37.25 Thursday in
over-the-counter trading on news of Kelly's $690 million offer.
   Envirodyne of Chicago said it had discussions with Kelly and
investment banker Salomon Brothers Inc. on their proposal to acquire
all of the company's outstanding stock for $38 a share.
   With 18.2 million shares outstanding, the offer values Envirodyne
at $690 million.
   Envirodyne spokeswoman Helen Gallagher said company executives
had not decided whether a sale would be in the best interests of
shareholders.
   Kelly, the former chairman of Beatrice Co., declined to comment
on the offer.
   He heads D.P. Kelly &amp; Associates, a Chicago firm he formed after
resigning from Beatrice last year to seek, in partnership with
Salomon, acquisitions of ``undervalued companies.''
   Envirodyne also said it had been asked by Artra Group Inc., which
owns 26.3 percent of Envirodyne, to consider Artra's participation
with Kelly and Salomon.
   Last August, Artra tried and failed to put together a cash offer
for Envirodyne that would have been worth about $36 per share.
   Artra officials declined to comment. The company, based in
Northfield, owns Sargent-Welch Scientific Co. and 70 percent of Lori
Corp., a jewelry and accessories business.
   Kelly, 66, rose to prominence in the 1970s by transforming
meatpacker Swift &amp; Co. into Esmark Inc., a conglomerate of food and
consumer products. He sold Esmark to Beatrice in 1984, then teamed
up two years later with leveraged buyout specialist Kohlberg, Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. to purchase Beatrice for $6.2 billion.
   Kelly announced his resignation from Beatrice in August after
selling off portions of the company.

   The stock market showed little change today after
a monthly report on trade that came in close to expectations.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .72 to 2,310.71
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers held a narrow lead over losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 470 up, 422 down and 526

a bit stronger than expected.
   Analysts said the figures raised some concern that the Federal
Reserve might be inclined to tighten credit further.
   But they also noted a general sense of relief that the trade data
didn't contain any unpleasant surprises, as some talk on the Street

<HEAD>Carl's Jr. Exec Indicted For Securities Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Carl's Jr. fast food chain's general
accounting director has been indicted by a federal grand jury on one
count of securities fraud in connection with insider trading.
   Alvin A. DeShano, 53, of Orange, was charged Thursday with
receiving and using confidential company information to avoid a
$7,107 loss on stock involving the Anaheim-based Carl Karcher
Enterprises, which runs the Carl's Jr. hamburger restaurants.
   A statement from Loren Pannier, chief financial officer of
Karcher Enterprises, said, ``Al remains an active employee of the
company. This matter should have no effect on the company's
business.''
   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuit
last April accusing DeShano of using an Oct. 12, 1984, financial
report to get rid of 1,725 shares of Karcher stock. DeShano sold the
shares on Oct. 15, 1984. On Oct. 23, 1984, Karcher Enterprises
publicly announced that lower earnings resulted in a drop in stock
value.
   DeShano could not immediately be reached for comment Friday. A
call placed to his office before business hours went unanswered.
   His attorney, David M. Wiechert of Irvine, said his client
``never would have intended to deceive or defraud anyone.''
   ``He had legitimate reasons for diversifying his investments and
assets at the time of the sale that were wholly unrelated to the
information,'' Wiechert said.
   The SEC lawsuit also accused Karcher Enterprises Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Carl N. Karcher along with 14 of his
relatives of avoiding more than $300,000 in stock losses. Six of the
16 defendants, including company President Donald F. Karcher, have
agreed to pay $187,560 in fines and penalties to end their
involvement in the SEC suit.
   The remaining defendants, including DeShano, are scheduled to
stand trial on April 11. DeShano is the only one who has been
criminally charged.
   If convicted he could be sentenced to up to five years in prison
and fined $250,000.

<HEAD>Dividends Up, But Still Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Along with rising stock prices, dividends have
been making news with cheerful regularity in the investment world of
late.
   Spurred on by strong earnings, such blue-chip companies as
General Motors, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, General Electric
and Coca-Cola all have raised dividends in recent weeks.
   But some analysts doubt this marks the start of a major trend.
Dividends still have a long way to go, they say, to regain anything
like the stature and importance they were accorded a generation ago.
   Dividend payments by the companies that make up Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock composite index rose ``an unusually strong'' 11 percent in
1988, says S&amp;P in its weekly publication The Outlook.
   This year, however, the firm is projecting what it called ``a
more typical'' 5 percent increase.
   When companies have found themselves with cash to spare in the
1980s, they have opted more and more frequently for an alternative
to a dividend increase _ buying back some of their stock.
   A buyback gives each of the remaining shares outstanding an
increased, though indirect, claim on a company's earnings.
   Unlike a dividend payment, it does not create a tax liability for
individuals and other taxable investors.
   For investors that aren't subject to current taxes, such as
pension funds, a buyback helps provide a stable market for those who
wish to sell their shares, and leaves the rest free of the need to
decide how and where to reinvest a cash payout.
   Three decades ago, it was an accepted principle that stocks
should yield more than bonds to compensate for the extra risk they
represented.
   Today, stocks' dividend yields, averaging about 3.5 percent, pale
beside the 9 percent available from a virtually risk-free Treasury
bill.
   Since World War II, the percentage of total earnings companies
pay out in dividends has fluctuated in a range of roughly 40 percent
to 60 percent. The high points came in the prosperous 1960s, and the
lows occurred in the inflation-wracked '70s.
   Lately, this ``payout ratio'' has fallen once again to the
extreme low end of its historic range.
   The absence of any drastic pickup in inflation argues for an
upturn in the payout ratio soon, maintains Jeffrey Applegate, an
analyst at Tucker, Anthony &amp; R.L. Day Inc.
   ``There's no evidence yet that the ratio is rising,'' he said in
a recent commentary. ``But the third year in a row of
non-accelerating inflation should cause companies to boost that
payout.
   ``If they don't, the risk is that somebody else will come along
and increase shareholder value, and those managements will be
looking for new jobs.''
   Historically, dividend increases have been seen as tangible
declarations of confidence and optimism from corporations, expressed
in hard cash rather than verbal promises or projections.
   Analysts Ned Davis and Martin Zweig, in their advisory
publication Futures Hotline, say positive trends in dividends do
tend to work in the market's favor _ up to a point.
   By the time almost all the dividend news is favorable _
increases, resumptions, extra payouts as opposed to decreases or
omissions _ it can be read as a danger signal, they say.
   ``At that level, the increasing dividends suggest that
corporations are overconfident,'' Davis and Zweig conclude. ``When
everything looks `too good,' the market tends to be overbought and
risky.''

<HEAD>Report: U.S.-Soviet Trade Proposal Would Allow Repatriation Of Dollars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of U.S. companies is close to completing
a proposed trade pact with the Soviet Union that would allow foreign
businesses for the first time to take profits out of that country in
dollars, according to a published report.
   Executives of the six U.S. companies, called the American Trade
Consortium, and officials of more than 30 Soviet trade and economic
organizations have negotiated for nine months to complete the
agreement, Business Week said in its Feb. 27 issue.
   The accord, which was expected to be signed by early April, would
clear the way for the six corporations to negotiate joint ventures
in the Soviet Union, and could prove to be the biggest and most
complex trade agreement ever developed between the West and the
Soviets, the magazine said.
   Central to the accord is the guarantee that the countries would
be allowed to repatriate their profits in dollars from the Soviet
Union.
   A number of Western companies already have embarked on joint
ventures in the Soviet Union, but the inability to repatriate
profits in dollars has been seen as a key obstacle in expanding that
field.
   The American Trade Consortium companies include Ford Motor Co.,
RJR Nabisco Co., Chevron Corp., Eastman Kodak Co., Johnson &amp;
Johnson, Archer Daniels Midland Co. and the New York merchant bank
Mercator.
   Foreign companies generally cannot take dollars from the Soviet
Union because the country badly needs the currency to buy imports.
Soviet exports are limited, so dollars are in short supply.
   Under the agreement, the companies earning dollars would create a
cash pool and would be allowed to take dollars out in proportion to
the amount of rubles they put in.
   Chevron would be a key cash provider at the outset, under the
plan, through a joint venture for the export of Soviet oil. While
the other U.S. business would be mainly selling to the Soviet market
for rubles, Chevron would be bringing in dollars. Chevron's earnings
would then go into the cash pool to cover any profits that are
repatriated by the companies.
   The hard currency U.S. companies need to repatriate their profits
will be guaranteed by Soviet institutions.
   The other U.S. companies also are working out their own deals.
   Eastman Kodak has been negotiating to produce blood analyzers and
floppy disks as well as to sell film and operate photofinishing
laboratories; Archer Daniels Midland is negotiating to set up a
factory to produce fructose, starch and ethanol; Johnson &amp; Johnson
is looking to health products ventures; and RJR Nabisco is
negotiating the manufacture of cereals, crackers and cigarettes, the
magazine stated.
   Ford is working on a venture to help the Soviets revitalize their
auto industry starting with the import into the USSR of its Scorpio
model and eventually setting up production facilities.
   Last month, the American Trade Consortium offered to buy the
partially built U.S. Embassy in Moscow for use as business offices
for the group.
   The United States halted construction on the embassy because it
was found to have been riddled with Soviet listening devices while
the Soviets were building it.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Slip In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a continuation of the selling
that brought soybean and wheat prices down sharply near the close of
Thursday's session.
   Major factors in the sell-off include improved growing conditions
in South America and reports that France has overcome some
logistical hurdles to completing a sale of 1.5 million metric tons
of wheat to the Soviet Union.
   The development lessens the possibility that the Soviets will
need to increase their purchases of U.S. wheat, as some traders had
hoped.
   The Brazilian government on Wednesday issued a report pegging the
1988-89 Brazilian soybean crop at 22.6 million metric tons, an
increase from the 21.5 million to 22.1 million metric tons forecast
in December.
   The improved outlook for the South American soybean crop is based
on wetter weather in Brazil and Argentina, where drought conditions
prevailed earlier in the growing season.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.22 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
1{ cents lower with March at $2.67} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents
lower to \ cent higher with March at $2.03 a bushel; soybeans were
1} cents to 3\ cents lower with March at $7.25{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent to .55 cent higher with April at 76.17
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .58 cent higher with
March at 82.30 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with April at 41.92 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.57 cent lower to .28 cent higher with March at 37.85 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Narrowly Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices were narrowly mixed today in quiet
trading after the government reported a widely-expected decline in
the nation's trade deficit.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was off 3-32 point, or
about $1 per $1,000 face amount, at midday. Its yield, which moves
in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 9.06 percent from
9.05 percent late Thursday.
   Corporate bonds prices edged up, however.
   The Commerce Department said the December trade deficit declined
to $11.9 billion from a revised November figure of $12.2 billion.
The November shortfall was originally reported at $12.5 billion.
   Economist Robert Chandross of Lloyds Bank in New York said the
bond market shrugged off the slight improvement in the trade picture
because ``it was close to what was expected.''
   He said trading was subdued as traders prepared for a three-day
holiday weekend that will keep the U.S. credit markets closed on
Monday.
   ``The market is still licking its wounds,'' Chandross said,
referring to the steep decline that has sent some 30-year bond
prices down by about 3 points over the past seven sessions.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments slipped 1-16 point, intermediate maturities were off
3-32 point and long-term issues fell [ point, according to Telerate
Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was unavailable.
   In corporate trading, industrials were up. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.57
to 297.75.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.78 percent as the
discount rose 2 basis points to 8.48 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 9.05 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to
8.55 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.27 percent as the
discount rose 5 basis to 8.56 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 9 5-16 percent, down from 9] percent late
Thursday.

   President Bush, back on the road championing his
$1.16 trillion spending plan, said today he will personally
participate in high-level budget talks next week and share
responsibility with Congress for difficult spending cuts.
   Bush said he had invited House and Senate leaders to the White
House next Tuesday, the day before he leaves on a five-day Far East
trip, for a round of talks to speed a budget accord.
   ``Together, we've got to make the budget process work,'' Bush
told students at Washington University here.
   Next week's meeting appeared designed to blunt Democratic
criticism that Bush's budget enabled him to take credit for
proposing expanded social programs, while leaving Congress with the
unpopular job of finding ways to pay for them through cuts in other
areas.
   Budget analysts say the spending plan Bush unveiled last week,
while calling for restraints in defense spending but new initiatives
in education, housing, child-care and environmental cleanup, falls
about $9.6 billion to $11 billion short of meeting the deficit
targets he set forth.
   ``I am committed to working closely with my friends on the Hill
to help them meet the target date set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
law for an April 15th budget resolution,'' Bush said.
   That law, which requires a balanced budget by 1993, calls for a
deficit in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1 of no more than
$100 billion _ down from an estimated $160 billion this year.
   Failure of Congress to meet the targets can result in
across-the-board cuts in military as well as civilian programs.
   Direct involvement by a president this early in the budget
process is rare. However, Bush has promised all along to work
closely with the Democratic-controlled Congress and engage in a
number of bipartisan meetings with leaders.
   Bush spokesman Stephen Hart said next week's White House meeting
was ``the beginning of his (Bush's) personal involvement with
Congress in the budget process.''
   He said Bush was not seeking to sidestep the usual legislative
process, and that Tuesday's session likely would not involve any
detailed ``number crunching'' over specific spending levels.
   The president told his audience that he had called the top five
congressional leaders to attend the meeting: House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas., House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois,
House Democratic Leader Thomas Foley of Washington, Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan.
   Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the chairmen and
ranking minority members of the congressional budget, finance and
appropriations committees would also be there.
   Fitzwater called the session ``an opportunity to assess progress
thus far, to go over some of the numbers that have emerged in
preliminary sessions. The president also wanted to build momentum
while he is out of the country'' visiting the Far East.
   Fitzwater said those at the meeting would discuss ``where do we
go from here, how do we get more direct negotiations.'' In his
speech, Bush said the session was intended to demonstrate ``a spirit
of bipartisanship'' and to show a readiness on his part to ``get on
with the nation's business of getting a quick and early resolution
to this budget crisis.''
   Bush, as he has done this week in two other out-of-Washington
appearances, outlined the highlights of his budget plan, calling it
``responsive and responsible'' and ``fair-minded in its strategy.''
   He gave particular emphasis to its proposed initiatives on
education, including the first installment toward a $500 million
program of grants for the nation's best schools.
   ``We have made education the Gateway Arch of the Bush
administration,'' the president declared, referring to the city's
trademark steel arch on the banks of the Mississippi River.
   His talk at Washington University here follows similar remarks on
his budget to business leaders in New Hampshire on Monday and to
state legislators in South Carolina on Wednesday.
   Today's address also stressed volunteerism in the private sector
_ one of Bush's pet themes.
   ``My friends, from now on in America any definition of a
successful life must include serving others,'' he said, ``in
child-care center, in the corporate boardroom, at the Rotary, at
Little League, or a tutoring program, and in a church or synagogue.''
   He characterized his budget as one that ``leaves power in the
hands of the people'' and said, ``I know we can have a government
with a heart as well as a head.''
   ``We must forge strong partnerships between all levels of
government and voluntary organizations, business corporations, and
individuals _ to lend a hand, mend a wound, and help the less
fortunate,'' Bush said.
   On Thursday, Bush rejected the notion that he had been
deliberately vague in the budget to put the onus on Congress alone
for coming up with unpopular spending cuts.
   ``Yes, there's a lot more detail that has to be hammered out. And
we will work with them to satisfy their interests, and find out what
they want. It's a two-way street,'' Bush said in an Oval Office
interview with a group of reporters.

   The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $137.34
billion in 1988, the first annual decline since 1980, as a surge in
exports offset a relentless climb in imports, the government
reported today.
   The Commerce Department said exports shot up to an all-time high
of $322.22 billion last year, a dramatic 26.8 percent above the 1987
level, led by a boom in sales of American-manufactured products and
farm goods.
   The huge gain in exports was enough to offset an 8.3 percent
increase in imports, which also rose to a record level of $459.56
billion.
   For December, the trade deficit shrank slightly to $11.9 billion,
down from a revised November figure of $12.2 billion.
   However, both November and December represented the highest
imbalances between what the United States imported and what it sold
abroad since August.
   Analysts are worried that the improvement in America's trading
performance has stalled out. After improving dramatically in the
first half of 1988, the deficit actually began to widen again toward
the end of the year.
   Reversing that trend and getting further trade improvements is
one of the major economic challenges facing the new Bush
administration.
   The trade deficit along with the related federal budget deficit
represent the twin towers of debt that President Bush inherited from
Ronald Reagan.
   Reacting to the report, the administration said it was committed
to working for a further reduction in the trade deficit by boosting
America's competitiveness on world markets and shrinking the budget
deficit.
   Many analysts say the budget deficit has played a major role in
the worsening trade performance of the 1980s by making America more
dependent on foreign investment.
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said congressional
approval of the Bush budget, along with a cut in the capital gains
tax, would help to further reduce the trade deficit.
   ``Reducing the cost of capital, increasing personal saving and
promoting research and development will go a long way to ensure that
America wins at home and in the global marketplace,'' Mosbacher said
in a statement.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the decline
in the trade deficit ``good news. It does show steady improvement, a
trend of improvement.'' He said the trade deficit had dropped 22
percent on a year-to-year basis.
   The $137.3 billion deficit for all of 1988 was down 19.4 percent
from the all-time high of $170.3 billion set in 1987. It was the
first year that the trade deficit has shown any improvement since it
fell 12.5 percent to $31.4 billion in 1980, the last year of the
Carter administration.
   During the Reagan years, the deficit soared above the $100
billion mark as Americans' appetite for foreign goods proved
insatiable. In 1985, then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III
engineered a coordinated effort with major U.S. allies to devalue
the dollar on foreign currency markets in an effort to make American
goods more competitive and imports more expensive.
   The strategy has proven successful in boosting exports but has
had much less of an impact in curbing imports.
   Some economists believe the dollar will have to fall further to
see more improvements in trade. Other analysts, owever, worry that
steeper declines could scare off the foreign investors the United
States has come to depend on to finance its borrowing needs and
could run the risk of igniting a new inflationary spiral.
   For 1988, the 26.8 percent surge in exports boosted the fortunes
of American manufacturers, who hired thousands of new workers and
rushed to expand production facilities.
   The narrowing of the trade deficit and the boom in business
investment contributed fully half of overall economic growth in 1988.
   The Bush administration must now work to promote further export
increases in 1989 or run the risk that economic growth will slow
appreciably. This would be a setback for the administration's other
economic problem: finding a way to reduce the huge federal budget
deficit.
   For 1988, sales of manufactured goods surged 25.2 percent to
$214.8 billion, reflecting increases in a variety of categories from
office equipment to airplanes.
   Sales of agricultural products were up an even stronger 29.3
percent to $37 billion, but analysts said much of this increase
reflected higher prices caused by last summer's drought.
   As usual, America's largest trade imbalance was with Japan, a
deficit of $55.4 billion, down 7.3 percent from the all-time high
set in 1987.
   The deficit with the 12-member European Economic Community was
down even more sharply, falling 47.2 percent to $12.8 billion for
1988. The deficit with Canada, the largest U.S. trading partner,
declined by 9.6 percent to $10.6 billion.
   For December, imports and exports both rose to record monthly
highs. Exports climbed 5.6 percent to $29.19 billion and imports
jumped 3.3 percent to $41.09 billion.
   Many economists are predicting that, based on recent trends, the
1989 deficit will rise.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington economic forecasting firm,
said he expected the 1989 trade deficit to rise to $150 billion.
   Such an increase would act as a sharp drag on overall economic
growth, as measured by the gross national product.
   Many economists forecast the overall GNP will grow just 2.7
percent in 1989, down from a four-year high of 3.8 percent in 1988.
   This economic slowdown would spell trouble for the Bush
administration, which is counting on continued rapid growth to boost
government revenues and lower the budget deficit.
   On Thursday, President Bush said his administration will try to
keep the export boom alive by seeking to reduce barriers that are
keeping American products out of foreign markets.
   ``We've got to knock down barriers, and we will relentlessly
pursue negotiations to end subsidies that distort markets and that
restrict trade,'' Bush said.

   The Big Three automakers set a record with
combined earnings of $11.21 billion last year, but forecasts of
slower economic growth are casting doubt on whether the bonanza can
continue.
   ``I think we're getting a little closer to saturating the market
in cars, and interest rates will begin to take their toll,'' said
auto analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York,
who predicts Big Three earnings will fall 10 percent to 15 percent
in 1989.
   The combined earnings of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. for 1988 were up 14.5 percent from the previous
combined record of $9.79 billion in 1984.
   Ford told its employees today they would get profit-sharing
checks of about $2,800 apiece next month, lower than last year's
$3,700 because of a decline in U.S. earnings. General Motors is
giving profit-sharing checks of about $254 per employee. Chrysler's
will be about $720.
   Analysts predict the U.S. economy will soften this year, taking
the auto industry with it.
   New vehicle sales for the 1989 model year are forecast to fall
from the 15.6 million cars and light trucks sold for 1988 _ the
third best on record _ to about 15 million.
   Given the economic climate, a decrease in vehicle sales might be
better than an increase ``because the increase would imply an
economic boom, and busts follow booms,'' said Scott Merlis, an auto
analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   And even with lower sales and a 15 percent earnings decline in
1989, Merlis said, Detroit ``would still be at a healthy level from
an earnings point of view.''
   Executives from each of the Big Three said cost-cutting programs
helped boost 1988 earnings. GM said it saved $4.8 billion by
trimming costs.
   But one of the unknowns in the automakers' future earnings
equations is the cost of buying incentives that customers have come
to expect.
   GM spokesman Terry Sullivan said the company spent about $4.2
billion on incentives and discounts on option packages in 1988, 55.6
percent more than in 1987.
   David McCammon, Ford's finance vice president and treasurer, said
the No. 2 automaker spent about $400 million more on incentives in
1988 than the previous year. He declined to disclose specifics, but
estimated that Ford spent about 25 percent less per car on
incentives than GM.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston declined to say how much
incentives cost the No. 3 automaker last year or how it compared
with 1987. In the past, Chrysler has used incentives liberally,
gaining market share by selling more cars while losing profits.
   Besides forecasts of dropping vehicle sales volumes and continued
cost- cutting, some experts fear there could be a recession in the
next few years. But even that, some analysts said, wouldn't be a
disastrous for the automobile industry.
   Merlis said the Big Three could increase earnings by 50 percent
over the next five years on flat or lower sales, through massive
cutbacks.
   ``Recessions have a tendency to create belt-tightening,'' he
said. ``The best is yet to come when it comes to the cost-cutting
potential.''

   With a strike deadline looming, a federal judge
issued injunctions today against both Eastern Airlines and the
Machinists union to resolve an aircraft maintenance dispute that the
carrier says has grounded 17 jetliners.
   Senior U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins ruled the militant
union must work on 12 grounded aircraft and members must work
overtime if required by the carrier ``with no slowdowns and no
sickouts.''
   He also decided that work already begun by outside contractors
hired by Eastern on five aircraft will be allowed to continue, but
Eastern has been barred from farming out any more such work during a
30-day cooling-off period in their stalled talks.
   If no contract agreement is reached by midnight March 3, Eastern
is free to impose its own work rules and the 8,500-hundred member
union representing Eastern machinists, baggage handlers and other
ground crews are free to strike.
   ``We have 17 aircraft on the ground, normally we have zero,''
Eastern attorney David Ross told the judge as the airline fought the
union's motion to keep all maintenance work in house. ``We can't get
these done even if we get back to full production.''
   Ross contended there was too much backlog for the Machinists
alone to handle the work, and outsiders are needed to get all of the
aircraft back in service.
   But George Tucker, attorney for the union, responded: ``It's our
work. We can do it. We will work overtime if required, and there
will be no slowdowns.''
   Ross kept repeating that the Machinists will be pushed to the
limit as new aircraft come in for maintenance, and Tucker repeated
the union's arguments that the work has traditionally been down by
organized labor.
   With the attorneys bickering, Atkins broke in and said, ``I've
made my ruling. There will be no more planes or equipment shipped,
but the work may continue on the five planes that are already
undergoing work.''
   ``I am entering an injunction against both sides effective from
now on until March 3. The company can continue the work on the five
that are already out, but no more will be shipped,'' the judge said.
``The union will do all the work required of them, including
overtime if asked with no slowdowns and no sickouts.''
   His verbal order will be backed by a written decision in the
afternoon, Atkins said.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the groundings first
disclosed in court Wednesday have forced the airline ``to adjust the
schedules downward.'' He said passengers were being warned in
advance of any cancellations.
   ``Even the present backlog of grounded aircraft is totally
unacceptable and poses a severe threat to a company in Eastern's
dire financial condition,'' the Miami-based carrier wrote in its
court briefs.
   Wildcat walkouts earlier this month ``were overt acts of economic
warfare and tended to further the bargaining goals'' of the union,
the filing said.
   Russ McGarry, vice president of the Machinists' Miami local,
blamed the delays on management's actions in preparation for a
possible strike.
   ``We feel the company has purposely shipped out the parts,
shipped out equipment and depleted the number of personnel available
to work,'' McGarry said. ``They suspend a crew, then turn around and
farm out the work because there was nobody to do the job.''
   Eastern, a subsidiary of Houston-based Texas Air Corp., reported
losses estimated at $335.4 million for 1988.

<HEAD>ICC Approves 5-Year Antitrust Exemption For Trailer Train</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interstate Commerce Commission approved
today a 5-year antitrust exemption that allows a company owned by
major railroads to continue controlling rail car purchases.
   The company, Trailer Train Co. of Chicago, had asked for a
15-year extension over the objections of the Justice Department, the
state of Oregon and a major rail car builder. The commission imposed
some conditions on the arrangement and the final wording was being
worked out, said ICC spokesman Dennis Watson.
   The ICC gave the company an extension of a pooling arrangement
critics say amounts to a ``monopsony.'' This is an antitrust term
for a company that controls purchasing in an industry, often
enabling it to set prices and dictate product development.
   Trailer Train, which is owned by 22 railroads, controls about 80
percent of the nation's railroad flatcar fleet, including the vast
majority of intermodal cars, which are used to carry standardized
containers that also are loaded onto ships and trucks.
   ``The arrangement, including joint purchasing and ownershp of
rail cars, will be in the interest of better service to the public
and economy of operation, and will not unreasonably restrain
competition,'' the ICC said in its ruling.
   The company's pooling and leasing procedures allow railroads to
exchange cars so they can be used more efficiently and not have to
return empty.
   The commission also approved a proposed stock ownership
redistribution which extends ownership of Trailer Train to some
smaller railroads.
   Critics, including a company that has sold thousands of railcars
to Trailer Train, said prior to the decision that competition among
railcar suppliers will not survive if Trailer Train continues to
have control over purchasing for all of the nation's railroads.
   William A. Furman, president of Greenbrier Cos., whose subsidiary
Gunderson Inc. builds railcars in Oregon, said, ``Under these
current conditions, Trailer Train can, with government sanction,
abuse this tremendous economic power. We know they have abused it in
their dealings with us.''
   Furman noted that airlines are not allowed to pool together and
buy airplanes, ``nor can the railcar builders join together to
acquire raw materials, fix prices or allocate markets.''
   He said the number of companies building freight cars has fallen
from 20 in 1979 to four today.
   The Justice Department in November 1987 questioned Trailer
Train's antitrust immunity and asked the ICC to hold hearings and
reconsider before deciding whether to grant an extension. Today's
decision followed a 15-month investigation, including hearings
before an ICC administrative law judge.
   Oregon, whose pension fund has a 10 percent interest in
Gunderson, supported the Justice Department's action.
   The ICC approval, which takes effect in 30 days, is subject to
reconsideration if anyone can show the commission that the pooling
arrangement has not resulted in better service to the public or more
economic operation or has hindered competition, the commission said.
   The decision gives Trailer Train an antitrust exemption through
Sept. 30, 1994.

<HEAD>Eastern Shuttle Offering Gift Certificates To Passengers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, in its waning days as operator
of a Northeast air shuttle, is offering its shuttle passengers $50
department store gift certificates in a bid to lure fliers from Pan
Am Corp.'s rival service and keep its own passengers from defecting.
   Ailing Eastern started the promotion last month, a few weeks
after Pan Am started mailing its frequent shuttle passengers coupons
worth $25 off a one-way Pan Am shuttle ticket.
   The $50 Eastern certificates, redeemable at Bloomingdale's and
other well known department stores in the Northeast, are given to
passengers buying round-trip tickets. Two or more of the
certificates may be combined toward a purchase and certificates must
be redeemed by March 15.
   ``They (Eastern) are trying to hold the shuttle together,'' said
David Perelman, president of DMS Travel in New York. ``They're using
this as an incentive, as a bribe to keep people on the shuttle.''
   One-way shuttle fares are $99 during peak hours.
   Miami-based Eastern, which faces the threat of a possible strike
by its machinists union on March 3, also has introduced coupons for
the rest of its domestic system offering passengers big discounts if
they fly after that date.
   New York developer Donald Trump, who recently cleared a number of
regulatory hurdles, is scheduled to complete his $365 million
acquisition of the Eastern shuttle sometime next month.
   Eastern _ whose shuttle carries about 3 million passengers
annually _ and Pan Am are locked in fierce competition over their
lucrative shuttle services, which fly hourly between New York,
Boston and Washington and are used mainly by business travelers.
   Last week, Pan Am launched a new advertising campaign for its
shuttle service, calling it the ``Corporate Jet.'' Pan Am officials
denied that the new ad blitz was planned in anticipation of the
flamboyant Trump's debut as a competitor.
   But they conceded that curiosity and publicity about Trump will
prompt some passengers to take his shuttle service on a trial basis.
   Pan Am said its service now commands nearly 50 percent of the
Northeast shuttle market it shares with Eastern.
   The gift certificates are ``an attempt by Eastern to thank people
for their loyalty,'' Bruce Nobles, the head of the Eastern shuttle,
said in a telephone interview. He denied that the promotion was
designed to match Pan Am's flight credit coupons.
   Nobles formerly was president of the Pan Am shuttle and left
about a year ago to work for Eastern.
   ``We've really had a wonderful response (to the certificates); we
have seen an increase in customers on the shuttle,'' said Eastern
spokeswoman Cori Zywotow in Miami. She declined to specify the
increase in shuttle bookings which the airline attributes to the
certificate giveaway.
   The $50 certificates can be redeemed at Bloomingdale's and Macy's
in the New York area; Garfinckel's, Woodward &amp; Lothrop and
Bloomingdale's in Washington; and Filene's, Jordan Marsh and
Bloomingdale's in Boston.

   British media baron Robert Maxwell canceled a major
address Friday on the launch of his English-language newspaper, The
European, saying his editorial team was not yet ``pursuing shared
goals and a unified concept.''
   The launch of the new daily, aiming to start with half a million
readers across Europe in early May, has already been postponed once.
   Maxwell, however, said in a last-minute letter in which he
withdrew as a keynote speaker at a European conference of Foreign
Press Associations that he had a ``total commitment to launching The
European as the first pan-European paper.''
   The 65-year-old Maxwell, who bought the U.S. publishing giant
Macmillan Inc. for $2.6 billion last fall, oversees a publishing
empire with operations in 28 countries and 40,000 employees.
   ``I would rather make sure this important project is right than
stick to a preconceived timetable and get it wrong,'' he said.
   ``Until I can be satisfied as publisher and editor-in-chief that
the English and French components of our editorial team are fully
and successfully integrated and pursuing shared goals and a unified
concept, I will not launch the paper,'' he added, saying he would
have another announcement next month.
   Maxwell immediately came under attack from participants at the
conference, aimed at setting the groundwork for better working
conditions for foreign correspondents around the world, particularly
in Europe.
   Eugenio Scalfari, editor of the Rome's largest circulation daily
La Repubblica, called the concept of The European ``a bestiality,''
adding that there was no such thing as European public opinion or
unified taste. He claimed that Maxwell was closing a printing plant
in France and firing some employees, reflecting difficulties in
starting such a newspaper.
   Scalfari supported the concept of national newspapers distributed
abroad, and challenged the Soviet Union to allow a newspaper owned
by Western Europeans to be printed in Moscow and distributed
throughout the country.
   The two-day conference, inaugurated by Italian President
Francesco Cossiga, also heard a proposal by the president of Italy's
state-owned television system to start a European newsfilm agency to
counteract American dominance of the field.
   The new Federation of Foreign Press Associations will seek to
avoid restrictions such as censorship and travel bans, and try to
limit physical harm to foreign correspondents around the world.

<TEXT>
   Dennis B. Levine, the convicted Wall Street
insider trader whose exposure led to a major scandal, is briefing
business school students these days on the consequences of
white-collar crime.
   Under tight secrecy and a ban on reporters, Levine on Thursday
told a story of greed and power gone awry to about 90 Columbia
Business School students.
   ``He said it's very easy in such a heady exciting atmosphere
simply to lose yourself in the enormously competitive race,'' said
James Kuhn, who teaches ethics at Columbia and attended Levine's
speech. ``He now realizes it was a major source of his downfall.''
   Levine, 36, was paroled last year from a two-year jail term for
securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. He had admitted making
$12.6 million in a five-year insider trading scheme by using
illegally obtained information about pending corporate takeovers.
   Levine's squealings led federal authorities to Ivan Boesky, the
now-imprisoned speculator who used illegal information peddled by
Levine to make millions himself.
   Dressed in a dark suit like the investment banker he once was,
Levine spoke for about 20 minutes at Columbia then answered student
questions for more than an hour, people in attendance said.
   He was brought to campus with the business school dean's approval
by a student group devoted to business ethics. Levine wasn't paid
for his appearance, Columbia officials said.

   Stock prices closed higher Friday after an
afternoon rally sparked by strong early Wall Street gains helped the
British market recoup earlier losses.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 9.1
points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,042.9, its best level for the day. The
index moved in negative territory for most of the session, losing as
much as 14.5 points at late morning.
   Volume was thin, with 464.5 million shares traded, down from
Thursday's 644.1 million shares.
   Trading activity was light amid what dealers said was uncertainty
about the market's direction. A slight amount of buying interest
late in the day sparked widespread markups, they said.
   The market shrugged off a sharp rise in British inflation. There
also was scant reaction to a U.S. trade report that fell within
market expectations, dealers said.

<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., reorganizing
again, said Friday it would decentralize this year by giving more
power to the heads of 15 to 25 business units.
   The change should help the former phone monopoly focus on the
bottom line, but is likely to unsettle employees who have already
gone through several reorganizations since the 1984 breakup of the
Bell System, said Richard Toole, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst.
   ``The old monopoly mentality is really being wrung out of the
company,'' Toole said. ``To another extent, you would like to get it
(the management structure) right, get it fixed once and for all.''
   The Wall Street Journal reported on the reorganization in a
Friday story based on an interview with Randall Tobias, an AT&amp;T vice
chairman. AT&amp;T did not officially announce the changes.
   ``More of the basic business decisions in the future will be made
by these individual business units rather than an overlay of top
corporate executives,'' said Walter Murphy, an AT&amp;T spokesman.
   ``There's not one big cutover date for this. It's all going to be
happening as the year rolls out,'' Murphy said. ``At a time when
things are going pretty well for us, this should make the company
perform even better.''
   The presidents of AT&amp;T's five major operating groups will be
renamed group executives and will oversee sets of business units
that will have direct responsibility for profits and losses, the
company said.
   The group executives will be Sam Willcoxon, in charge of
international activities; W. Frank Blount, communication products;
Victor A. Pelson, communication services; Robert M. Kavner,
computers; and E. Wayne Weeks, transmission and switching equipment.

<TEXT>
   Dennis B. Levine, the investment whiz turned
crook whose squealings spawned Wall Street's insider trading
scandal, is briefing business school students about a subject he
knows: white-collar crime.
   Levine, paroled from a federal prison last year, told his story
of greed gone awry to about 90 rapt Columbia Business School
students Thursday in a tightly guarded and unpublicized session,
people who attended said.
   The visit to the prestigious school came against a background of
increased emphasis on ethics by business educators, partly because
of criminal behavior in the seductive high-stakes world of
securities and commodities trading.
   Levine, who was not paid to speak at Columbia, traced his
involvement in a five-year scheme that turned $40,000 into $12.6
million in illegal profits via his trades on illegally obtained
information about pending corporate takeovers.
   ``He said it's very easy in such a heady exciting atmosphere
simply to lose yourself in the enormously competitive race,'' said
Columbia professor James Kuhn, who teaches ethics and attended the
speech. ``He now realizes it was a major source of his downfall.''
   Levine, 36, was paroled last September from a two-year prison
term for securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. He remains under
the supervision of federal probation authorities until April.
   In a plea bargain with government prosecutors, Levine pleaded
guilty to four felonies, was fined $362,000 and returned $11.6
million in illegal profits.
   The ex-investment banker, who worked at several investment firms,
is best known for snitching on Ivan F. Boesky, the now-imprisoned
insider trader who himself made millions of dollars using
information supplied by Levine.
   Both men are key figures in a corruption scandal that has dogged
Wall Street for nearly three years.
   Levine's appearance at Columbia was endorsed by ethics experts
and former prosecutors, who said the theoretical approach by
business schools to social responsibility could use some real-life
lessons from financial felons.
   Charles Carberry, a former assistant U.S. attorney who arrested
Levine in May 1986, said that as long as Levine isn't making money
by peddling his life story on the campus lecture circuit, speaking
would be effective.
   ``When you have close physical contact with someone who's really
gone through the ringer, all these penalties you read about take on
a new reality,'' said Carberry, who is now in private practice.
   ``I think he might be able to tell them things about his
experience they may never be able to get out of a book,'' he said.
   Levine would be permitted to profit on a book about his
experiences under a New York law that prohibits only violent
criminals from exploiting their stories for money.
   But he has kept a low profile since his release and is said to be
occupied with pending civil suits against him. Levine is permanently
barred from working on Wall Street. His attorneys did not return
telephone calls Friday.
   Another famous insider trader, former Wall Street Journal
reporter R. Foster Winans, went on a speaking tour and wrote a book
after he was convicted of securities fraud charges. Winans in 1983
agreed to tip a broker about upcoming market-sensitive newspaper
columns in exhange for a cut of the broker's profits.
   Columbia officials said Levine agreed to speak on a guarantee of
no publicity. The school deployed a public relations staffer in the
lobby to keep at least one newspaper reporter away from Levine.
   Levine was brought to campus by a student group called MORES _
Managing Organizations Responsibly, Ethically and Successfully _
with the approval of the dean. Only students in the group and two
ethics classes could attend.
   According to students who attended the speech, Levine praised the
skill of government prosecutors and said he made naive and foolish
mistakes but never clearly stated that the ordeal fundamentally
altered his values.
   Levine's remarks, they said, were more about law-breaking than
ethics-making. Kuhn said students were ``quite skeptical of a man
who could get himself into these problems and not have greater
qualms about it.''
   Levine spoke for about 20 minutes then answered questions for
more than an hour. He was dressed in a dark suit like the investment
banker he once was.
   ``I told him privately he would have been much more effective if
he came dressed in sackcloth and ashes,'' Kuhn said.

   Stock prices kept climbing today after a monthly
report on trade that came in close to expectations.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.11 to 2,325.54 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 894 up, 511 down and
515 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit narrowed to $11.89 billion in December from a revised
$12.22 billion the month before.
   The latest figure jibed with Wall Street estimates in the
neighborhood of $12 billion, although both exports and imports were
a bit stronger than expected.
   Analysts said the figures raised some concern that the Federal
Reserve might be inclined to tighten credit further.
   But they also noted a general sense of relief that the trade data
didn't contain any unpleasant surprises, as some talk on the Street
had suggested Thursday.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Eastman Kodak, up ~ at 48{;
DuPont, up ~ at 98}; McDonald's, up 1] at 51{; Procter &amp; Gamble, up
} at 91~, and General Electric, up 1[ at 47[.
   Navistar dropped ] to 5} in active trading. On Thursday the
company reported lower earnings for its fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31.
   Bank of New York rose 2 to 44, hitting a 52-week high. The
company said Thursday it expects annual earnings growth of 15
percent to 20 percent through 1991, somewhat more than its
historical targets.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.86 to 166.37. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .53 at 325.68.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 128.47 million shares with an

<HEAD>Soybeans Surge In Late Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rallied higher Friday on
the Chicago Board of Trade as the market digested the day's bearish
news and adjusted to the reality of tight supplies. Grain futures
advanced modestly.
   The surge in soybean futures brought the market off its lowest
level this year. Earlier in the day, soybeans for delivery in March
had fallen to $7.22 a bushel on reports of steadily improving
growing conditions for the South American soybean crop.
   The Brazilian government had issued a report on Wednesday pegging
the 1988-89 Brazilian soybean crop at 22.6 million metric tons, an
increase from the 21.5 million to 22.1 million metric tons forecast
in December.
   The improved South American crop prospects have kept the soybean
market under pressure most of this month. But Friday's rally
suggested traders had refocused on the tight supply situation
created by last summer's drought.
   ``Everybody lost sight of the major point that there are very few
beans in the world at this point,'' said Cathy Leow, an analyst with
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   At the close, wheat was \ cent lower to 2 cents higher with the
contract for March delivery at $4.24{ a bushel; corn was { cent to

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 150,000 Ford Motor Co. workers will
receive profit-sharing checks of at least $2,800 apiece next month,
the second-largest such payout in company history, executives said
Friday.
   The amount is 10 times more than the profit-sharing payments
General Motors Corp. employees will receive and nearly four times as
large as the planned payment to Chrysler Corp. workers.
   The Ford payments, which total $460 million, will be split among
workers represented by the United Auto Workers union, some salaried
employees and some laid-off and retired workers.
   The exact number of workers eligible for the payments and the
precise amount of money will be set by the time checks are mailed
March 6, said Ford spokesman Tom Foote.
   At GM, eligible workers will receive profit-sharing checks of
about $254, while Chrysler employees will receive average payments
of $720 next month.
   The profit-sharing payments outlined in the companies' contracts
with the UAW are tied to earnings in the Big Three's U.S. operations.
   The Chrysler payment announced Feb. 2 is the first linked to
corporate profitability and will be sent to about 80,000 employees.
Chrysler paid its UAW-represented workers about $500 each in lieu of
profit-sharing checks during the last two years.
   On Tuesday, about 470,000 GM workers learned they would receive
profit-sharing checks for the first time in three years.
   Last year, Ford employees got about $3,700 apiece. But earnings
from U.S. operations shrank this year at the nation's No. 2
automaker, reducing the profit-sharing checks.
   ``Ford's current track record of immense profitability gives the
company unique opportunities, which it should carry out, to be used
to strive for better quality, better health and safety and better
working environmets in the plants,'' UAW Vice President Stephen
Yokich, head of the union's Ford Department, said in a statement
Friday.
   Dale Brickner, the associate director of the School of Labor and
Industrial Relations at Michigan State University, said it was
unlikely profit sharing would produce immediate effects on
automobile production or quality.
   ``In the long term, it might,'' he said. ``Profit-sharing in most
American firms is a fairly recent kind of innovation. What we don't
know about is very large-scale operations or huge corporations like
GM or Ford.''

   From the Champs Elysees to the Japanese
Parliament to Hong Kong's waterfront stock market, authorities
suddenly are prosecuting securities frauds that had been ignored,
overlooked or condoned for years.
   The enforcement campaigns have led to embarrassing scandals in
France, Japan, Hong Kong, Mexico and elsewhere for crimes that range
from profiteering on inside information to bribery and embezzlement.
   To many U.S. securities-law specialists, an intriguing common
thread among these crackdowns is their coincidental timing.
   Some experts believe the highly publicized insider trading
scandal on Wall Street has jolted foreign governments into
scrutinizing sleazy practices in their own backyards.
   ``I think what's been happening in the United States in the last
five years has caused countries like France and Japan to beef up
enforcement efforts in terms of securities regulation,'' said
William Tyson, a legal studies professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton business school.
   Louis Loss, a Harvard Law School professor who has been consulted
by foreign governments in drafting securities regulations, said many
were several decades behind the United States in anti-fraud
enforcement and only now were grappling with the severity of
white-collar crime.
   Part of the reason, Loss speculated, is ``they've read about the
financial scandals in our country.''
   He also said they're beginning to understand the necessity of at
least trying to show investors that their markets are fair, because
``you're not going to play cards with me if I've got a marked deck.''
   Others said the explosive worldwide expansion of the securities
industry over the past several years, coupled with quantum leaps in
communication technology that make cross-border trading easy, have
forced many governments to toughen previously lax anti-fraud laws.
   ``We've seen more scandals because the markets are growing,''
said Michael Mann, associate director for international affairs at
the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division in
Washington.
   ``The bottom line is you can trade in any market now from
anywhere in the world and get your money to that market to close the
deal,'' he said.
   To be sure, insider trading, manipulation and other shady market
practices long deemed illegal in this country remain widespread in
many parts of the noncommunist world.
   In Britain, stock prices of companies targeted for takeovers
often rise sharply at least one month before the official public
announcements of deals, although insider trading has been illegal
since 1980.
   In West Germany, where insider trading is not only tolerated but
a term for insider doesn't exist in the language, stock prices
regularly rise in advance of improved earnings reports.
   Switzerland, historically a haven for the profits of illegal
financial dealings because of tough bank-secrecy laws, only made
insider trading a crime last July.
   In Hong Kong's freewheeling stock exchange, which many trading
professionals have likened to the Dodge City of international
securities markets, conflicts of interest are said to be a way of
life.
   It was the only exchange to shut down for completely for four
days after the October 1987 crash. Eight market officials including
former Chairman Ronald Li were arrested later on charges of taking
bribes.
   Things aren't much better in Mexico City, where earlier this
month prosecutors arrested four top brokers and interrogated dozens
more in connection with widespread fraud allegations that range from
insider trading to sale of phony securities. Almost all of Mexico's
24 registered brokerage houses have been implicated, and securities
regulators have promised tough new rules.
   Japan, home to the biggest stock market, modeled its postwar laws
on securities fraud after those in the United States but rarely
enforced them. One reason, said Tyson, is ``the Japanese never felt
insider trading was wrong.''
   A recent Japanese move to put teeth in its laws has since led to
a massive stock-trading scandal that's jolted the country's
governing party and created a nationwide debate about business
ethics.
   The scandal involved the sale of thousands of shares of unlisted
stock by the Recruit Co. to politicians and other prominent people
at bargain prices. The buyers reaped windfalls when the shares were
publicly traded later.
   Three Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen other senior-level
aides have resigned, and there has been speculation about the
involvement of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   An equally serious scandal has been dogging French President
Francois Mitterrand's government because of an intensified
securities-fraud enforcement campaign by the Commission des
Operations de Bourse, France's market regulator.
   The commission found evidence of blatant insider trading in the
stock of the U.S. company Triangle Industries Inc. immediately
before it was taken over by Pechiney SA, a French metalmaker. Those
implicated included businessmen with close ties to Mitterrand.
   It is unclear why the French commission seized upon the Triangle
takeover as the launchpad for what has become daily front-page news
in France. But people familiar with the probe have said the French
were tipped off by their American counterparts at the SEC, which has
been attempting to negotiate a cooperation agreement with France and
several other countries for policing international market frauds.
   To date, the SEC has only secured cooperation agreements with
Britain, Japan, Switzerland, three Canadian provinces and Brazil.
Many countries simply ignore SEC requests for help in tracking paper
trails, and some have laws that ban foreigners from gaining access
to any financial records.
   Mann declined to say whether the SEC played a role in the
Triangle-Pechiney affair. But he said the need for international
cooperation in securities law is one of the most sensitive problems
faced by the enforcement agency.
   ``From the SEC perspective, the focus is to try to work out
arrangements with foreign countries that allow us to properly
enforce the U.S. securities laws without infringing on the
sovereignty of those countries,'' he said.

<HEAD>GAF Corp. Reschedules Shareholders Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAYNE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GAF Corp. said Thursday its annual meeting had
been rescheduled to March 2 to give shareholders time to review
proxy materials, which include revised financing for a proposed
management-led buyout of the company.
   The meeting originally was set for Feb. 22.
   Shareholders are to vote on the proposed $53-a-share cash and
securities buyout led by Samuel J. Heyman, GAF's chairman and chief
executive.
   Under the revised financing arrangement, Heyman will buy $48
million of notes and an additional $2 million in preferred stock,
GAF said.
   Meanwhile, the chemical and building-materials company and James
T. Sherwin, its vice president, are standing trial in Manhattan on
charges of stock manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud
conspiracy and other crimes for their alleged attempt to boost the
price of Union Carbide, the target of a failed GAF takeover attempt.
