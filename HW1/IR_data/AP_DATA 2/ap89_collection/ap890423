   Firefighters mopped up a series of forest and
brush fires Sunday, but the danger of more blazes remained high
through a third straight day of record high temperatures and gusty
wind.
   Since Friday, six fires have broken out in the region from Pikes
Peak west of Colorado Springs to Boulder County northwest of
Denver. They were reported contained or near containment Sunday,
and had caused no injuries or structural damage.
   ``People haven't caught up with how tinder-dry things are,''
said Charlie Knight, fire information officer for the U.S. Forest
Service's Pike and San Isabel forest districts.
   Denver warmed to a record high again Sunday at 82 degrees. The
National Weather Service said the heat, coupled with strong
southwesterly wind and low humidity, made fire danger across the
state high to extreme.
   A blaze scorched about 20 acres just southwest of Denver, and
officials said visitors to nearby Mount Falcon State Park had been
asked to leave.
   An air tanker was dropping fire retardant on the blaze, said
Charlie Knight, fire information officer for the Pike National
Forest.
   Authorities said one fire _ a 600-acre brush fire in Denver that
was put out Saturday _ may have been caused by arson. The other
fires may have been caused by humans unintentionally, they said.
   The largest blaze, an 872-acre forest fire west of Monument,
broke out Friday and was 100 percent contained Sunday, Knight said.
   ``There is not even a wisp of smoke coming up now,'' he said.
   Some firefighters from that blaze were released to fight a
150-acre fire near Deckers. That fire began Saturday afternoon and
was 60 percent contained Sunday, forest service officials said.
   Smaller fires were reported in Mueller State Park, about 45
miles west of Colorado Springs, and in Boulder County's Left Hand
Canyon.

<HEAD>UC Wondering About Young Grad's College Career</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University officials are investigating
allegations that an 11-year-old boy who became the youngest person
to graduate from college was allowed to take a staggering course
load that one authority called ``unconscionable.''
   In some of his classes at the University of California at Santa
Cruz, Adragon De Mello was struggling to just pass, according to a
report published Sunday. The boy received a degree in computational
mathematics last year.
   Adragon's advisers should have been concerned by the pressures
on him, his often mediocre work and the high number of waivers and
grade changes he received, said UC Santa Cruz Vice-Chancellor
Isebill Gruhn.
   The college advising system apparently ``let him down,'' she
said in Sunday's editions of the Santa Cruz Sentinel, which
obtained copies of Adragon's transcripts, evaluations and other
university documents.
   After viewing the documents last week, Gruhn called the boy's
course load ``unconscionable.''
   UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Robert Stevens said Friday that his
office will investigate the handling of the boy's academic career.
   Adragon made national headlines and became an entry in the
Guinness Book of World Records when he graduated last June.
   His father, Agustin De Mello, defended his son's academic record.
   Any negative evaluations of his son's work were written by
people who were prejudiced against the boy, said De Mello. The
father had drawn up plans for raising a boy genius _ including
advanced degrees and a Nobel Prize by age 16 _ even before Adragon
was conceived.
   It was the university, De Mello said, that placed all the
pressure on his son to take so many classes. That was because the
family could not get the kind of financial aid to support two years
of study instead of one, he said.
   According to university records cited by the paper, Adragon took
a double load of classes and often used petitions and waivers to
win exceptions from UC's usual requirements.
   And while Adragon did well in some mathematics and computer
classes, he struggled in others. His performance in one astronomy
course was the poorest of anyone's in the class and was ``far below
the pass-fail cutoff,'' the instructor wrote in an evaluation.
   ``The source of this stress was probably the fact that,
according to what he told me, he was taking six courses this
quarter,'' wrote the professor, Merle Walker. ``If it is true, I
question why the relevant authorities within the university
permitted him to do this.''
   The usual load at the Santa Cruz campus, which issues ``pass''
or ``fail'' grades, is three courses per quarter. Gruhn said it was
a serious matter for any student to take even four.
   Adragon on three occasions also did not complete his course work
by the end of the term and petitioned to have the grades changed to
``pass'' after completing makeup work.

   Thousands of people from Budapest, Hungary, to Wichita, Kansas
marked the 20th annual Earth Day on Saturday with protests against
the Exxon tanker spill, ozone-destroying chemicals and other
environmental concerns.
   But demonstrations fizzled in Sweden and India for lack of
interest, and a rally in West Germany attracted less than 100
people, officials said.
   In New York City, about 1,000 demonstrators rallied at Exxon's
midtown headquarters, then marched to the United Nations.
Organizers estimated the crowd swelled to more than 5,000 people by
the end of the march, but police put the number at 2,500.
   The Exxon tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground near Valdez, Alaska,
on March 24, spilling 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into
wildlife-rich Prince William Sound in the worst such spill in
American history.
   In a speech to demonstrators, activist Jeremy Rifkin said
environmental politics had changed dramatically since the first
Earth Day in 1970.
   ``All of our previous environmental crises have been regional in
nature. Now we are experiencing for the first time a global
environmental crisis,'' Rifkin said. ``The greenhouse effect,
global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain and species extinction
now threaten the entire planet and all the inhabitants that live in
it.
   ``This is the first international Earth Day,'' he said, claiming
it was the first time demonstrations were coordinated around the
world.
   In Rome, about 1,000 people and 40 environmentalists cheered as
20 protesters dressed in cardboard costumes resembling aerosol cans
and refrigerators ran up the Spanish Steps and smashed through a
paper hoop symbolizing the Earth's ozone layer.
   The demonstration was intended to re-enact the creation of holes
in the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons, which are chemicals used
in aerosol propellants and refrigerators.
   Ozone occurs naturally in the Earth's stratosphere and screens
out harmful ultraviolet light from the sun. Studies have shown that
chlorofluorocarbons are breaking down the protective barrier.
   In Budapest's Vorosmarty Square, several hundred people turned
out for a demonstration sponsored by the Radical Party.
Demonstrators included Ilona ``Cicciolina'' Staller, a
Hungarian-born porn actress and a Radical Party member of Italy's
parliament, and Nobel Prize-winning biophysicist Maurice H. F.
Wilkins of Britain.
   Near Wichita, Kan., about 750 people gathered outside chemical
plants owned by Racon Inc. and Vulcan Chemicals to demand they stop
using chlorofluorocarbons within a year.
   According to environmentalists, Racon is one of five U.S.
companies that produce the chemicals and Vulcan is major supplier
to those businesses.
   Spokesmen for the two companies said a ban on
chlorofluorocarbons is not realistic because reliable alternatives
have not been found, and that the chemical industry is spending
billions of dollars trying to find other substances.
   In Frankfurt, West Germany, only about 60 people turned out for
a demonstration at the Hoechst chemical company, police said.
   ``The weather was pretty rainy, and that might have had
something to do with it,'' said police spokesman Wolfgang Nebelung.
   About 500 people rallied at a park in San Jose, Calif., and
marched to an IBM plant where they tied green and white ribbons on
a gate to protest the use of chlorofluorocarbons in the electronics
industry.
   ``In this beautiful setting we are dealing with a problem that
in 20 years could be deadly. In 20 years, it may not be safe for
people to lie in the sun,'' consumer advocate Ralph Nader said at
the rally.
   More than 1,000 people learned how to make non-toxic household
cleaners and received other environmental tips at an exposition at
Michigan State University in East Lansing.
   About 200 people gathered in Chicago for an Earth Day observance
that resembled a picnic more than a protest.
   Speakers, however, criticized Exxon for its part in the oil
spill. ``This would not be a safe place for a person from Exxon,''
said Bob Rudner of Greenpeace.
   Bill Harding showed up in a bathrobe made of common lawn grass,
and hawked grow-your-own starter kits for $25 each.
   ``It makes me feel closer to the Earth,'' Harding said. ``It's
like you have your own portable environment.''
   In Harrisburg, Pa., Gov. Robert Casey marked Earth Day by
announcing more than $600,000 in grants for cleaning up the
Susquehanna River Valley.
   Environmentalists at the University of Colorado in Boulder
celebrated Earth Day on Friday with a Festival of the Earth
featured a recycling Olympics in which competitors stomped aluminum
cans and rolled trash bins in relay races.
   The first Earth Day celebration was held in April 1970.

   A rare California condor chick that was hatched
in captivity was inadvertently named for a long-extinct Indian
tribe, chagrined wildlife officials said.
   Mandan, a bald, dull-yellow chick, emerged from its shell on
Wednesday. It was the second California condor to be conceived and
hatched in captivity and became only the 29th member of its species.
   All of the condors are living in captivity, part of a gamble by
biologists to breed the giant birds of prey back from the brink of
extinction.
   After it was hatched, officials said they named the chick after
an Indian tribe native to the eastern Rockies.
   ``Whatever you do, make sure people know that we had nothing to
do with picking that name. It was the guys up at Fish and Game,''
said Tom Hanscom, a spokesman for the Wild Animal Park, where the
chick was hatched.
   ``It wasn't me,'' said Joe Dowhan of the California Fish and
Game Department. ``I think it was one of our biologist's favorite
Indian tribe names and he didn't spend a whole lot of time
researching it.''
   The Mandans _ an Indian word for river bank dweller _ were
peaceful farmers who lived in the 1700s on the banks of the upper
Missouri River in North Dakota, according to Art Gustafson, an
amateur historian who lives in Mandan, N.D. The tribe was wiped out
in the late 1800s by a smallpox epidemic brought to the area by
white settlers.

   Rioters in two provincial capitals burned cars
and buildings and beat police, witnesses and official reports said
Sunday.
   The rampages occurred Saturday as about 150,000 students and
supporters demonstrated in Beijing against the communist system.
That protest, one of the biggest in Communist China's 40-year
history, ended peacefully.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said that mobs in the ancient
city of Xian burned buildings and vehicles and injured 130 security
forces.
   American sources and Chinese reports from Changsha said rioters
smashed store and car windows along the main street of the southern
city and beat up police.
   Smaller protests also occurred in Shanghai, Nanjing and Tianjin.
In Shanghai, student leaders said their universities warned them to
stop protesting.
   The demonstrations began early last week following the death of
ousted Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang. His funeral was Saturday
in Beijing and the occasion of the massive student rally there.
   Students have been demanding a radical changes in the structure
of the communist system, including a free press and expanded human
rights.
   In a related development, more than 200 leading intellectuals
signed an open letter to the government supporting the student
demands.
   Hundreds of professors and teachers from dozens of Beijing's
leading universities previously signed an open letter that called
on the government not to take violent measures to quell the
protests.
   Xinhua said the attack in Xian, provincial capital of Shaanxi
province, began when tens of thousands of people, including
students, gathered in front of the provincial government compound
to listen to a broadcast of Hu's funeral service.
   It said ``some lawbreakers from society'' began shouting
anti-government slogans and tried to force their way into the
government compound. In all, 130 security force members were
injured, it said.
   A British student said that when he arrived at Xincheng Square
in front of the government headquarters, about 50 youths were
throwing rocks at a truck carrying security forces.
   ``The whole area was covered with people,'' he said. ``Some were
holding banners and standing peacefully but others were really
going crazy, ripping limbs off trees and throwing anything they
could at the police.''
   The rioters set fire to several banners and tried to set fire to
the truck carrying the security forces, said the student, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   A Japanese student said most of the rock-throwing youths were
``hooligans.'' He said police took at least 30 people away,
including several students. Xinhua said 18 were arrested.
   The Xinhua report said that soon after the violence began the
students quickly left. Rioters, however, set fire to two rooms of
the government compound and stoned a tourist bus carrying
foreigners. The report did not identify the foreigners or say if
anyone was hurt.
   The report said another protest began Saturday night and a mob
pulled down a wall of the compound, set fire to an oil tank and a
garage, and burned four vehicles. The rioters also burned two buses
and robbed a garment store while fleeing police, according to the
report.
   The report said security forces cleared the square but did not
give further details.
   The British student said he returned to the area about 8:30 p.m.
and that several hundred security forces with guns and riot helmets
had blocked access to the square.
   ``Flames were coming from behind walls of the provincial
government,'' he said. ``The smell of smoke was everywhere.''
   Riots also broke out in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province
and Hu's home province.
   Foreign sources said students commandeered a bus and truck
during a march by about 1,000 students from Hunan University to the
provincial government headquarters.
   The sources said students carried wreaths for Hu but did not
shout political or anti-government slogans.
   After the students left campus, they were joined by thousands of
non-students, including young street toughs who ``went wild'' and
began breaking store windows, the sources said. The crowds fled
when nine truckloads of security forces appeared, the sources said.
   The state-run radio of Hunan province reported that ``lawless
elements'' had ``beat up and injured People's police, wrecked shops
and looted goods.''
   Hu's death April 15 sparked a week of demonstrations. He lost
his post as party chief in 1987 after being accused of being too
soft on students involved in pro-democracy demonstrations in
1986-87.
   In Tiananmen Square in Beijing, students faced about 8,000
soldiers and shouted ``Down with dictatorship, down with
corruption!'' as top members of the Communist Party filed out of
Hu's funeral.
   Bedlam set in shortly after noon when authorities opened up the
square to pedestrian traffic and the numbers swelled to more than
200,000. Workers, unemployed youths and curious bystanders flooded
the well-organized student ranks.
   Soldiers rushed the crowd once, although no injuries or arrests
were reported.
   Student leaders ended the rally about 1 p.m., and only about
10,000 people remained in the square three hours later.
   Rioting has been rare since the Communists came to power in
1949, except for the decade of the Cultural Revolution, which ended
in 1976.
   Over the past year, however, authorities have acknowledged
growing social unrest, including increased crime and strikes. Much
of the unrest has been attributed to economic problems, including
high inflation, shortages of goods, panic buying and profiteering.

   Hundreds of anti-racism
demonstrators marched for seven miles along a highway Saturday to
protest a gathering of skinheads and neo-Nazis nearby.
   After dark, the leader of the white supremacists was heard
leading a cross-burning ceremony and a glow was visible to
reporters a half-mile away.
   Police worked throughout the day to head off any confrontations
between the two groups.
   The 500 mostly young demonstrators on the Walk For Racial
Equality carried banners that proclaimed ``Celebrate Diversity''
and ``No Aryan Homeland in Our Home.''
   ``We're trying to show the rest of the country that Idaho is not
just potatoes and Nazis,'' said Russ Gee, a 26-year-old who was
among a contingent of people from the University of Idaho.
   A phalanx of Idaho State Police and Kootenai County sheriff's
patrol cars screened the marchers as they walked down a paved
bicycle path alongside the northern Idaho highway. A police
helicopter hovered overhead.
   The potential for violence and an unwillingness to give
publicity to the white supremacists led some human rights groups to
boycott the march, which ended two miles from the Aryan Nations
compound where a three-day conference of neo-Nazis and skinheads is
being held.
   Up to 2,000 anti-racism marchers had been expected, but
organizers said the opposition by some groups and cloudy, 47-degree
weather may have kept the numbers down.
   The marchers came from throughout the Pacific Northwest and
represented such groups as gay and lesbian activists, the
Washington state Rainbow Coalition and People Opposed to South
African Apartheid.
   Meanwhile, about two dozen participants in the white supremacist
gathering goose-stepped down the 200-foot road leading to their
compound to meet with reporters. Earlier, they canceled a march of
their own, saying skinheads did not want to be exposed to the
demonstrators.
   Kim A. Badynski, the Northwest organizer for the Ku Klux Klan,
said a cross would be burned there Saturday night.
   Reporters were kept a half-mile away from the gathering at the
30-acre ranch of Richard Butler, whose Aryan Nations group wants to
turn the Northwest into a ``whites only'' homeland. But Butler
could be heard leading a cross-burning ceremony after dark and a
glow was seen coming from the ranch.
   Sheriff's deputies had set up checkpoints on roads leading to
the Aryan Nations camp near Hayden Lake to check the IDs of people
entering the area.
   ``We've established what we feel to be tactics that are going to
ensure the safety of all the parties involved,'' said sheriff's
Capt. Tom Dickson.
   Lisa Anderson, organizer of Citizens for Nonviolent Action
Against Racism, the Coeur d'Alene group sponsoring the march, said
she expected few problems.
   Thirty to 40 Neo-Nazi youths were staying at Butler's ranch.
Butler said white supremacist leaders, including Ku Klux Klansmen,
would hold workshops on the white supremacist movement.
   The anti-racism march was endorsed by Jesse Jackson's Rainbow
Coalition and Washington Gov. Booth Gardner, but groups such as the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith stayed away.
   Marvin Stern, regional ADL director in Seattle, said his group
``views with great concern the events surrounding this weekend's
planned conference'' but decided not to march because of the burden
on law enforcement and potential for violence.
   Gov. Cecil Andrus also refused to endorse the march, echoing
fears that it could promote violence and give white supremacists
more publicity.
   The ADL estimates there are 2,500 to 3,000 neo-Nazi skinheads in
30 states, an increase in both numbers and geography since a 1988
report, Stern said.
   Many skinhead organizations do not espouse neo-Nazi beliefs, but
the conference demonstrates right-wing leaders' attempts to recruit
them, he said.

<HEAD>Report: Pakistan Ordered Afghan Rebel Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An assault by guerrillas on a key Afghan town
was ordered by the Pakistani government at a meeting attended by
the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, The New York Times reported in its
Sunday editions.
   The attack on the town, Jalalabad, was ordered against the
advice of the Pakistani director of military intelligence, the
newspaper reported, citing a Pakistani participant in the meeting
and other Pakistani officials.
   There was no Afghan present on March 5 when the decision was
made, the Times said.
   The Times reported that U.S. Ambassador Robert B. Oakley
attended the meeting but that it could not learn whether he took
part in the discussion or decision. Oakley, contacted by The
Associated Press in Islamabad on Sunday morning, refused to comment.
   State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty, asked to comment on
the newspaper's report Saturday night, said, ``I don't have
anything on that.''
   Afghan guerrillas laid siege to Jalalabad two days after the
meeting, and the offensive now is mired in its seventh week.
   Pakistani and U.S. officials had predicted that the Moslem
guerrillas would quickly overthrow the Soviet-backed Afghan
government after the Soviets finished withdrawing their troops on
Feb. 15.
   Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government ordered the
attack with the belief that an impressive victory in the town would
enhance the rebels' chances of forging ahead to the Afghan capital,
Kabul, the Times said.
   The newspaper reported that a participant in the March 5 meeting
said that Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, director of Pakistan's intelligence
agency, opposed the assault, saying that the rebels were not
capable of launching a conventional warfare attack to capture the
town.
   But a close adviser to Bhutto, retired Maj. Gen. Nasirullah
Babar, said that too much time had passed without a major rebel
victory since Soviet Union troop withdrawal was completed,
according to the Times.
   Since the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979, the
Pakistani Directorate General for Inter Services Intelligence, a
branch of the military, has shaped the guerrilla alliance and
coordinated its actions, the Times reported.
   When the United States threw its support behind the rebels, the
Central Intelligence Agency became Pakistan's main partner, the
newspaper said.

<HEAD>Lebanon Quiet After Riots Killed Eight; Hussein Arrives</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Hussein returned home Sunday to
confront the aftermath of rioting over government-imposed price
increases.
   An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the king
and his entourage arrived in the capital after dawn following a
trip to the United States.
   No rioting was reported on Saturday or Sunday following four
days of unrest in which at least eight people were killed and 83
injured in more than a dozen towns and villages.
   But security forces kept up heavy patrols in Salt, Maan, Kerak,
Mazar and other cities where rioters attacked government buildings
and battled police last week.
   The only significant demonstration on Saturday was at the
University of Jordan in Amman, where about 300 students peacefully
marched to express solidarity with rioters.
   Students chanted ``Down With Zaid Rifai,'' the prime minister,
who is blamed for the austerity measures. Witnesses said they also
chanted ``Long Live King Hussein.''
   Rioters throughout Jordan have expressed support for Hussein
while demanding Rifai's resignation.
   On Friday, several hundred rioters in nearby Salt smashed bank
fronts, looted a finance company, demolished police cars and pelted
officers with rocks, according to residents and security officials.
   ``The situation now, knock on wood, is calm,'' Crown Prince
Hassan told reporters at the royal palace on Saturday.
   Hussei canceled a trip to Britain to speed his return home.
   The king, interviewed on Cable News Network by syndicated
columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak on Saturday, blamed the
unrest on economic problems caused by the failure of other Arab
nations to come through with promised aid to Jordan.
   ``The underlying causes are the reality of foreign debt incurred
and equivalent to commitments made by certain Arab states,'' he
said, citing Libya, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf
nations.
   Hussein said the austerity that resulted ``is not easy for
Jordanians,'' but that his countrymen ``are certainly determined to
stand in the future, stand on our own feet.''
   The price rises were mandated by an International Monetary Fund
agreement under which Jordan is rescheduling its $6 billion foreign
debt. They came after more than a year of economic problems caused
by declining foreign income.
   In Jerusalem, an Israeli government official said Saturday that
authorities there were concerned about the disturbances in
neighboring Jordan.
   ``I don't think there is an immediate danger to Israel, but we
have a general interest that Jordan should be stable,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``King Hussein is a plausible partner for peace,'' he added.
``It's safer to keep what we have and what we know. Instable
regimes in this region have more of a tendency toward
belligerency.''
   But Israeli right-wing politicians have argued that the
replacement of Hussein by a Palestinian leader would benefit
Israel. Palestinians constitute about half of Jordan's population.
   They have said Jordan could then become a true Palestinian state
and thus solve the issue of Palestinian self-determination without
Israel having to make territorial concessions.
   West Bank Palestinians, meanwhile, called on their brethren in
Jordan to avoid the disturbances.
   ``We are concerned that any problems in Jordan might divert
attention from the main issues of the Palestinian conflict,'' said
Said Kanaan, a prominent PLO supporter and businessman from Nablus.
   The riots mark the worst civil unrest since the Jordanian army
crushed Palestinian guerrillas in 1970-71. At the time, Israeli
troops were deployed along the border, prepared to intervene in the
fighting if necessary.

   Twelve miners were injured Sunday
during an earth tremor in a coal pit in the central industrial city
of Zenica, a news report said.
   The official news agency Tanjug said 100 miners were in the pit
at the time. It provided no details on whether the injured were
hurt by landslides or falling objects.
   Three of the injured were hospitalized with broken bones, and
the other nine were released, Tanjug said, quoting a doctor on duty.
   No other details were given. The tremor appeared to have been a
natural event too small to rank as an earthquake.

   Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified two
Spanish missionaries, who were martyred in 17th-century Japan, and
three nuns who founded religious orders or did charity work abroad.
   The five made blesseds of the Roman Catholic Church were the
Rev. Martino di San Nicola; the Rev. Melchiorre di Sant'Agostino;
Sister Francesca Siedliska, a 19th century Polish nun; Sister Maria
Caterina di Santo Agostino, a 17th century French nun; and Sister
Maria Margherita Caiani, a 19th century Italian nun.
   Beatification is a step toward possible sainthood.
   The two Spanish missionaries were burned to death in 1632 over a
fire made with wet straw and green wood to keep it from burning too
quickly. They were tied by only a finger so they could break free
and demonstrate they were abandoning Christianity. Instead, the two
priests died for their faith.
   Sister Siedliska founded the Congregation of the Sacred Family
of Nazareth and Sister Caiani founded the Little Franciscan Sisters
of the Sacred Heart. Sister Agostino was beatified for her work in
Canada with the sick, poor and elderly.

<HEAD>Takeover Of Communist Insurgency Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic minority groups within the Burma
Communist Party insurgency have rebelled against the party
leadership and seized control of its national headquarters, a
state-owned newspaper said Sunday.
   The Working People's Daily said ``forces made up of persons from
national racial groups ... could not bear the domination of the
(party) in their political, military and economic affairs, and the
conflict between them grew.''
   It said the rebellious members captured the party headquarters
in Pangsang, about 415 miles northeast of Rangoon, and the
north-central branch office in Mongkoe, about 125 miles north of
Pangsang. Both are in Shan State.
   The newspaper did not say when the rebellion took place.
   With 15,000-20,000 fighters, the Burma Communist Party is the
strongest of a dozen guerrilla groups fighting the authoritarian
government. The group's leadership has been dominated by members of
the ethnic majority, the Burmese, but most of the fighters are from
minority groups.
   Government officials said earlier that the Wa and the Kokang
ethnic groups recently revolted against the Communist leadership,
and this was confirmed Sunday by independent sources who traveled
to the area of fighting.
   A source who demanded anonymity said there were reports the
ethnic groups arrested some Communist leaders.
   The Communists recruited the minorities after taking over their
areas along the Chinese border. They have paid them small amounts
of money to fight mainly in major operations.
   The Communist insurgency to overthrow the government began
shortly after Burma was granted independence from Great Britain in
1948. The party says it stands for democracy, but much of its
financing comes from opium trafficking.
   The insurgency has weakened because China has reduced, and
possibly cut off, its once significant aid to the Communists in
order to improve relations with the Burmese government.
   The turmoil within the party comes as the government has
inflicted major defeats on the Karen National Union, another major
insurgent group based along the eastern border with Thailand.
   On Tuesday, government forces seized the Karens' Maela camp 135
miles northeast of Rangoon after a 2-month-long offensive. A
government spokesman claimed that more than 600 guerrillas were
killed in the battle.
   Another major Karen stronghold, Maw Poh Kay, fell three weeks
earlier.

<TEXT>
   China's foreign debt reached $40 billion at the
end of last year, an increase of $5 billion from mid-1988, the
official China Daily said Sunday.
   The government is now taking measures to cut foreign borrowing,
which has been growing at an annual rate of 38 percent during the
past four years, the newspaper said.
   In recent weeks, the government has limited the number of
financial institutions and government offices allowed to borrow
abroad.
   Under new regulations, only 10 financial institutions are
authorized to obtain foreign loans, and only the central bank, the
People's Bank of China, can borrow from the International Monetary
Fund.
   The report quoted Zhang Jialun, a senior Finance Ministry
official in charge of debt management, as saying China's debt is
still manageable.
   International Monetary Fund managing director Michael
Camadessus, in a news conference in Beijing last week, praised
China's prudency in handling foreign debt and said China would not
become a problem debtor nation.
   But he said China's debt grew too rapidly last year and warned
of the dangers of giving too many local authorities the right to
borrow abroad.

   About 2,000 demonstrators marched through
Taipei streets Sunday to protest the proposed building of Taiwan's
fourth nuclear power plant.
   The demonstrators began the four-hour protest in heavy rain
outside a memorial hall in downtown Taipei and marched a mile to
the Economics Ministry, which supervises state-run companies.
   The march ended peacefully after ministry officials accepted a
letter of protest from demonstrators.
   ``We don't want another nuclear power plant. There are no fish
in the sea near the three nuclear power plants because of nuclear
waste pollution,'' said protester Wu Tien-fu, an 82-year-old
fisherman.
   Most demonstrators were residents of Yenliao village in Taipei
County, where the state-run Taiwan Power Co. announced in 1986 it
would build the $7.4 billion plant.
   Earlier Sunday, protest leaders delivered a petition, signed by
2,565 households of Yenliao village, that urged President Lee
Teng-hui to scrap the plant.

   Six players on the Ethiopian national soccer

   A senior official of the Egyptian Soccer Federation said the six
defected early Saturday.

   At the embassy, a spokesman refused to discuss the matter,
saying ``visa applications ... are a matter of privacy.''
   The sources all spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Egyptian official identified the six players as Tekare
Zoweidy, Solomone Yohanes, Solomone Hela, Alemeseged Aenishe, Jetu

<TEXT>
   About 60 neighbors of Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita marched to his home Sunday, demanding that he abolish a
new 3 percent sales tax and then resign.
   The group, which included parents with their children, marched
2.5 miles and stopped about 50 yards from Takeshita's home, said a
police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the demonstration was organized by citizens' groups in
the Tokyo neighborhood.
   The Kyodo News Service said the marchers yelled anti-Takeshita
slogans while shop owners and other onlookers along the street
waved their hands in support.
   Kyodo said Chuji Shibuya, an organizer, read a statement
declaring: ``We are really angry at you (Takeshita). You must
immediately abolish the consumption tax ... and resign.''
   The tax was introduced April 1 as part of a tax reform package
that includes cuts in income taxes.
   Takeshita's governing Liberal Democratic Party forced the tax
package through Parliament last year over opposition objections.
   Meanwhile, the opposition and some members of Takeshita's own
party want him to resign because of his government's involvement in
a major stock-profiteering and bribery scandal.
   Recruit Co., an information services conglomerate, sold
bargain-priced unlisted shares in a subsidiary to about 160
influential government officials, politicians and businessmen. They
profited when the share prices rose after public sale began.
   So far, 14 people have been arrested, and three Cabinet
ministers have been forced to resign.
   Takeshita has acknowledged that he received more than $1 million
in contributions from Recruit and that an aide bought some of the
stock.
   But he has denied personal wrongdoing and vowed to stay in
office.
   In Kyodo's latest poll, support for Takeshita fell below 4
percent.

The wreck was found Sunday morning on a wooded mountainside near
Aalen, about 40 miles east of Stuttgart.

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leftist political party in West Berlin's
coalition government said Sunday that protests will result if
President Bush accepts the mayor's invitation to visit this divided
city.
   ``We can do without a visit by Bush,'' said Hilde Schramm, a
parliamentary member of the Alternative List Party. Ms. Schramm
told The Associated Press the Alternative List strongly opposes
Bush's stand on a number of issues.
   ``We do not like the policies of the United States in relation
to Nicaragua, its pressure (on Germany and other NATO members) to
modernize short-range nuclear weapons, and that it has not grasped
opportunities for disarmament,'' Ms. Schramm said.
   She said the Alternative List played no part in the decision
last week by West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper to invite Bush. She
said if Bush comes he will be met with demonstrations and that her
party will take part.
   There has been no announcement of whether Bush might travel to
Berlin.
   He visits West Germany next month, arriving in Bonn May 30 and
leaving the following day after talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and other officials.
   Bush also plans to take a boat ride on the Rhine River, but
there are no plans for a trip to West Berlin, diplomatic sources
say.
   The Alternative List is the junior partner in the coalition
government led by Momper's mainstream Social Democrats. The union
resulted from the election defeat of the governing Christian
Democrats in January.
   It has been an uneasy political marriage because of the
Alternative List's often far-left views on key matters.
   The Alternative List and its sister party, the Greens, have in
the past helped stage huge anti-U.S. demonstrations.

   About 20 Turks and 15 German ``skinheads'' traded

   Many German skinheads, named for their shaved heads, are

   The fight broke out in the Charlottenburg district of West
Berlin late Saturday, according to a police statement.
   Armed with knives and broken-off chair legs, the two sides
fought each other in a melee that injured six skinheads, the
statement said.
   No arrests were reported.
   Confrontations between radical right-wingers and foreigners have
increased in West Berlin since January, when 11 members of the

   The Republican candidates rode a tide of resentment against
foreigners, who compete with Germans for scarce jobs and housing.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative

   The Harris Poll, published by The Observer newspaper, indicates
42 percent of those questioned favor the Conservatives, compared

   Last month, the two main parties were even at 41 percent, and in
February Labor led the Tories by 42 to 41 percent. The last time
Labor was ahead before then was October 1986.
   The newspaper noted the poll favors the Tories despite recent
bad economic news, including higher inflation, rising interest

   Mrs. Thatcher will celebrate her 10th anniversary in power May 4.
   The newspaper did not say when the poll was conducted, how many

<TEXT>
   A top Zimbabwean politician who
committed suicide after quitting the Cabinet in a corruption
scandal was buried Sunday as a national hero.
   Thousands flocked to Heroes' Acre, a shrine to those who died in
the independence war, for the state funeral of Maurice Nyagumbo. He
was the senior political affairs minister until resigning this
month.
   President Robert Mugabe paid tribute to the politician, who was
among his closest aides.
   Mugabe described Nyagumbo as a ``gallant freedom fighter'' and
``an outstanding revolutionary'' who made many sacrifices to
liberate his homeland from British colonial rule.
   The president told mourners Nyagumbo had taken his own life, and
police said he poisoned himself. The cause of death had been kept a
secret by authorities.
   Nyagumbo, 64, died in Harare's Parirenyatwa Hospital on Thursday
after being admitted with convulsions a day earlier.
   On Tuesday, Zimbabwe celebrated the ninth anniversary of its
independence from Britain, and the former minister was not invited
to the celebrations.
   Nyagumbo was one of the few surviving founders of Mugabe's
ruling Zimbabwe African National Union, the party that waged a
seven-year guerrilla war for independence.
   He spent two decades in colonial prisons as an alleged terrorist
and was widely acclaimed by black Zimbabweans as a champion of
political emancipation.
   After independence he held key posts in the Cabinet, the
15-member Politburo and the governing Communist Party's central
committee.
   Nyagumbo resigned this month as Senior Minister for Political
Affairs and the party's administrative secretary after a
presidential inquiry found he was involved in a racket involving
the black-marketeering of vehicles.
   According to a report, Nyagumbo abused his position by arranging
for friends to buy 38 vehicles directly from a state assembly plant
instead of waiting like other would-be buyers for up to 10 years.
The report said Nyagumbo probably received financial rewards for
arranging the deals.
   The minister himself denied receiving kickbacks.

   Students collected money on Beijing street
corners Sunday so they could start a newspaper to present what they
say will be an accurate account of a week of unrest.
   At least one state-run daily, meanwhile, broke an apparent news
blackout in the official press on the student demands for
democratic reform.
   The Science and Technology Daily, a newspaper for intellectuals,
came out Sunday afternoon with a sympathetic but carefully worded
account of the gathering Saturday of 150,000 student demonstrators
on Tiananmen Square.
   A Chinese journalist said reporters from the paper threatened to
quit during a stormy all-night debate that delayed publication of
the paper, which usually comes out in the morning.
   Further complications arose when the postal service refused to
deliver the paper, and reporters wound up delivering the edition,
students said.
   Several students sought donations on Beijing street corners so
they could form their own paper.
   ``Our movement is not to raise our salaries or get better jobs
after graduation,'' said one Qinghua University student in a speech
to a crowd of about 200. ``It's for democracy and freedom. It's for
the country.''
   Another student said they had collected more than 500 yuan,
about $135, in two hours.
   One person, asked why he donated 5 yuan, said ``I believe in the
truth. I believe people need to know what really happened at
Tiananmen Square.''
   In China, the press is run by the government, which censors news
in its attempt to control the flow of information. The government
views the press as a tool of the Communist Party.
   In an apparent effort to discredit the demonstrators, only the
most violent aspects of the recent protests breaking out in several
parts of China have previously been reported.
   Last week, newspapers reported in some detail protesters'
attempts to break into the Communist Party headquarters in Beijing.
They did not say that police beat and kicked students.
   On Sunday, the official Xinhua News Agency and the state-run
radio reported a violent clash in Xian, provincial capital of
Shaanxi, during which ``mobs of lawless elements'' torched vehicles
and buildings.
   The radio of Hunan province also reported that rioters in the
provincial capital, Changsha, broke windows and beat up police
during a demonstration there.
   Both violent protests also were reported on the nationally
televised nightly news.
   The Science and Technology Daily made no mention of violence.
   Along with several photos of the students marching peacefully,
it carried two articles on the Beijing demonstrations.
   ``University students expressed a common feeling that day:
continue the spirit of Hu Yaobang, carry forward the flags of
democracy and science and push forward the reforms ...,'' it wrote.
   Hu Yaobang is the former Communist Party chief whose April 15
death sparked the demonstrations. Hu was admired by intellectuals
for his reformist views and won sympathy when he was ousted from
power in 1987 for failing to stop pro-democracy student protests.

   The testimony in North's Iran-Contra trial, which went to the
jury last Thursday, galvanized North's lawyers.
   Defense attorney Brendan Sullivan interrogated Channell, trying
to demolish his credibility.
   Why was Channell's story coming up now for the first time? Was
he making it up? Wasn't it true he still faced sentencing on a tax
charge in the Iran-Contra affair? Wasn't it true the government
could tell the sentencing judge Channell had been a very helpful
witness?
   Channell's testimony last month went to one of the central
questions the jury must consider as it deliberates North's fate:
whether he obstructed and made false statements to Congress in 1985
_ with criminal intent.
   The jury debated the case all day Friday and then again on
Saturday morning before quitting for the weekend. Deliberations
will resume Monday morning.
   At the time North spoke with the Texas billionaire, national
security adviser Robert McFarlane was signing off on letters to
Congress denying that North was assisting the Contras. North is
accused of preparing drafts of the letters.
   North's fate hangs to a great degree on the question of intent.
   To obtain a conviction, the government must prove general intent
on North's part in connection with four charges that he made false
statements to Congress and the attorney general about his role in
the Iran-Contra affair. That is, he must have acted knowingly and
voluntarily in making false statements.
   North said he wanted then-President Reagan to invoke executive
privilege, with McFarlane refusing to answer the congressional
inquiries. North said he was overruled by his superiors.
   The burden on the government regarding intent is heavier on the
other eight criminal charges against North. There, the government
must prove specific intent, that is, that North acted with a bad
purpose.
   There is no doubt that North accepted a $13,800 home security
system, paid for by Iran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord.
   North said he accepted the system because he was trying to
protect his family after terrorist Abu Nidal placed him on a hit
list and after he had made unsuccessful efforts to get the
government to provide protection.
   There's no doubt North accepted $4,300 in traveler's checks from
Adolfo Calero as part of a $300,000 cash fund North ran out of his
office safe. North, accused of illegally converting the $4,300 to
his own use, acknowledged that he destroyed the ledger which showed
how the money was spent. The reason he destroyed it, says North, is
that he was trying to protect the names of Contra leaders whose
lives might be jeopardized if they were exposed.
   The prosecution has been stung by testimony concerning intent.
   One of North's colleagues at the National Security Council,
Vincent Cannistraro, testified that he recognized North's proposed
responses to congressional inquiries as false in 1985 and gestured
to signify that North's nose was growing like Pinocchio's.
   But, added Cannistraro, North told him he was having a dispute
with McFarlane over how to respond.
   North ``indicated he was not an entirely free agent in composing
his answers,'' Cannistraro said. ``He indicated a process by which
his answers were modified or changed.''
   Cannistraro gave the testimony about Pinocchio to a grand jury
in 1987. But prosecutor John Keker asked, why hadn't he said a word
then about North telling him he was having a dispute with McFarlane
over the false answers?
   Even the judge jumped in on the questioning, asking when the
testimony about the dispute had come to mind.
   ``I thought of it yesterday'' after meeting with North's
lawyers, Cannistraro answered.

<HEAD>NEA Facing Hot Leadership Contest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While most of America enjoys a respite from
presidential campaigning, the country's teachers are engaged in one
of the hottest leadership contests in the history of the National
Education Association.
   The candidates are a personable vice president with years of
inner-circle experience and a passionate champion of underdogs
prone to taking ``reasonable risks.'' Come July, one of them will
be president of the 1.9-million-member union, the nation's largest.
   With hats, buttons, banners and floor demonstrations, the scene
at the Washington Convention Center July 2-5 promises in many ways
to resemble last summer's political conventions.
   But there will be at least a couple of major differences. At
8,000 delegates, the NEA convention will be bigger than the
Democratic and GOP parleys combined. And instead of serving as a
forum to anoint a pre-selected candidate, this gathering will be
marked by ferocious last-minute campaigning and delegate-hunting by
the two men who hope to succeed Mary Futrell.
   Observers agree Futrell, highly popular with teachers and sought
after by the media, will be a tough act to follow. During her
unprecedented six-year tenure, she has raised both the union's
profile and its credibility on education issues.
   Futrell also helped the NEA weather withering attacks by former
Education Secretary William Bennett and shed its obstructionist
image during a period of increasing dissatisfaction with public
schools and calls for changes in teaching, curriculum and school
management.
   Teachers who don't want to rock the boat are lining up for Keith
Geiger, a conscientious team player during his last six years as
NEA vice president. Those seeking a more impassioned leadership
style are leaning toward John Wilson, an executive committee member
and special education teacher from Raleigh, N.C.
   Geiger points with pride to his negotiating ability and
political activism, honed in long years of collective bargaining
and Democratic politics in Michigan. Wilson touts his current
status as a part-time classroom teacher and an ``action-oriented
leadership style'' he says is lacking in Geiger.
   ``We're both establishment candidates, but one of us is an
activist. The question is, do you want an active or a passive
president,'' asserts Wilson.
   Wilson's campaign slogan, ``a better leader for tomorrow because
he teaches today,'' cuts to the heart of his argument that Geiger
is too much the bureaucrat, too long gone from the classroom.
   ``That's a phony issue. Mary Futrell has been out of the
classroom for nine years and I don't think anybody is saying she's
not a good president,'' Geiger shoots back. He depicts Wilson as a
hardliner who would lead the NEA back into its obstructionist past.
   ``The difference is whether we're going to hold onto our
longstanding, old-time traditional unionist hat _ that we have to
oppose everything that comes down the line unless we promote it, or
we're going to work for the kinds of education reform that will
help move the organization along,'' Geiger said
   Ed Foglia, a Wilson partisan and president of the California
Education Association, called Wilson ``a reasonable risk-taker.
Keith is a very personable individual, but he is not about to take
on the hard fight that John Wilson would. He is much more of a
compromiser.''
   Geiger and his supporters see that as an advantage. ``It's very
easy to get on the stump when you haven't had the opportunity to
work with power brokers and a whole set of people with vastly
different ideas. You have to be a negotiator,'' said Kathy Bell,
president of the NEA affiliate in Florida.
   Nowhere are the candidates' differences more apparent than the
way their campaign literature treats the controversial,
top-priority issue of teacher pay.
   Wilson says the union should ``expose the misuse of evaluation
systems for teacher pay'' and ``stand firm in our opposition to
merit pay and career ladder programs.'' Geiger says the NEA should
work for dramatic pay raises in a few key states that would serve
as models for other states, and try to get more federal money for
education. Though he opposes merit pay, it is never mentioned in
his statement.
   To Geiger, Wilson's adamance recalls the union's inflexible
past. To Wilson, Geiger's avoidance of issues smacks of selling out
to public opinion. ``I don't really believe in a go-along to
get-along attitude,'' Wilson says. ``I will not compromise the
needs of our members for a good editorial.''

treatment and eventually die of the disease, news reports and
officials said Sunday.
   ``Cancer is taking a heavy toll every year with little medical

   United News of Bangladesh news agency, quoting World Health
Organization officials in Dhaka, said the country now has more than

   Bangladesh, which has a population of 110 million people, has
only four major hospitals with facilities for detecting and

<HEAD>Husbands of Powerful Women Rally Behind Denis Thatcher's Banner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The little-known husbands of some of
Washington's most powerful women are rallying behind the banner of
their spiritual hero, Denis Thatcher, the retiring spouse of
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and patron saint of the
obscure.
   Members of a tongue-in-cheek support group called the Denis
Thatcher Society are ``men whose wives are deservedly more
prominent and influential than they are,'' says founder Charles E.
Horner.
   ``The society is designed to help these men maintain the
obscurity they have worked so hard to earn,'' he says.
   Horner knew his wife had beaten him at the Washington power game
a few years ago when he received a letter addressed to ``Mr. and
Mrs. Constance Horner.''
   Although Horner has a respectable job as associate director of
the U.S. Information Agency, his wife oversees 2.2 million federal
employes as director of the Office of Personnel Management and has
been nominated to become undersecretary of the Department of Health
and Human Services.
   ``The criterion for membership is that your spouse had to be
appointed to a job you wish you had,'' says lawyer R. James
Woolsey, who was Navy undersecretary under President Carter.
   Woolsey says he was known only as ``Sue Woolsey's husband'' in
White House receiving lines, when his wife was associate director
of the Office of Management and Budget for human resources.
   ``As undersecretary, I was trying to obtain some very limited
money for the Navy,'' Woolsey recalled. ``My wife, on the other
hand, had control of 51 percent of the federal budget and was
moving billions of dollars around. My envy knew no bounds.''
   Woolsey summed up the virtues of a bona fide society member when
he toasted then-Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., at a banquet honoring his
wife, Lynne Cheney, chairman of the National Endowment for the
Humanities.
   He praised Cheney as a spouse who ``dresses nicely, entertains
well and works productively outside the home.''
   Cheney has lost any potential eligibility for society membership
by becoming President Bush's defense secretary, Horner says,
although he might form an alumni chapter to ``tell us how it is on
the outside, running the Pentagon and chastising generals.''
   The society has no membership list, no initiation rites, no
secret password or handshake, not even an annual dinner where
members can commiserate over brandy and cigars.
   ``I've been thinking lately that we should meet for lunch at
some refined place equivalent to Schrafft's in New York, perhaps
the tea room at Garfinckel's department store in Spring Valley,''
mused Horner.
   ``We might have cold consomme, a tomato surprise, chicken salad,
some petit fours and weak tea. We couldn't wear white gloves, but
bow ties might be de rigueur.''
   Horner said his colleagues would like to entertain Thatcher,
whom they've never met, the next time the wealthy British business
executive comes to Washington.
   And they're eagerly awaiting the official visit next June of
Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, in the hope that her
polo-playing husband, Asif Ali Zardari, will tag along.
   ``He may not want anything to do with us, and who can blame
him?'' said Horner.
   Eligible males don't seek society membership and aren't invited
to join, says Thomas Harvey, a former Veterans Administration
official whose wife, Cathie Black, is publisher of USA Today. ``You
belong only in your own heart,'' Harvey says.
   Bernard Norwood, a private economic consultant, says he's
``contented to bask in the glory'' of his wife, Janet, who is
commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While Mrs. Norwood
presides over the annual convention of the American Statistical
Association here this summer, he says his assignment will be
``overseeing the wives' tea.''
   Boston stockbroker John Heckler recalls that when he was married
to former Rep. Margaret Heckler, R-Mass. _ later to become Health
and Human Services secretary and, still later, ambassador to
Ireland _ he was shocked to receive an invitation to become
president of the Congressional Wives Club, but turned the offer
down. ``I can't be,'' he replied. ``For God's sake, I'm a man.''
   But most members have learned to accept their lowly status with
good cheer and even a measure of manly pride.
   ``As second-income earners, we try to be very busy and
productive, lest people think we have jobs only as political
spouses,'' Horner said.
   While his wife works late or gives speeches on the banquet
circuit, Horner says he spends his leisure hours ``reading the
classics in search of greater wisdom.''
   Said Horner: ``What unites us is that we believe this is a very
enviable position. It's wonderful, one of the best things that can
happen to any man.
   ``Our central ideological principle is that the women's movement
is the best thing that ever happened to men, and our only hope is
that women don't come to their senses anytime soon.''

<HEAD>Douglas Petitions NTSB For Change In Northwest Crash Finding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is evidence that the pilots involved in a
deadly 1987 airliner crash, blamed in part on a warning system
failure, intentionally disconnected a similar alarm on another jet
two days earlier, the plane's maker says.
   In a petition filed with the National Transportation Safety
Board, Douglas Aircraft Co., a division of McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
said the pilots pulled a warning system circuit breaker on the
first plane, interrupting power to the system and silencing an
unwanted warning, The Detroit News reported Sunday.
   The same pilots, John Maus and David Dodds, were in control of
Northwest Flight 255, a McDonnell Douglas MD-80, when it crashed on
takeoff at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Aug. 16, 1987.
   The pilots died, along with 154 other people, including two
people on the ground. The only survivor from the plane was a
4-year-old girl. It was the second worst aircraft accident in U.S.
history behind the 1979 crash of an American Airlines jet near
Chicago that killed 275 people.
   The NTSB concluded last May that the warning system on the MD-80
failed to alert the pilots that they hadn't set the wing flaps and
slats, which provide added lift for takeoff.
   The board faulted the pilots for not setting the flaps and slats
and failing to complete a routine preflight checklist. The board
also said power to the warning system was interrupted, but couldn't
determine why.
   Douglas' petition, obtained by the newspaper, cited a note
written by Northwest pilot Merrill Hodges in September 1987. Hodges
said he found an alarm system circuit breaker pulled on another
MD-80 jet flown by Maus and Dodds.
   Flight records show Maus and Dodds landed that plane in Santa
Ana, Calif., on Aug. 14, 1987, and the plane stayed on the ground
until Hodges entered the cockpit the next day, Douglas' petition
said.
   ``The unavoidable conclusion is that the absence of power to the
takeoff warning system was the flight crew's intentional
disablement of the takeoff warning,'' the petition said.
   Northwest lawyer Carroll Dubuc said Douglas' petition doesn't
raise anything new and promised to file a response that will rebut
Douglas' claim.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified official of the Air Line
Pilots Association as saying the claim is false. The official said
the union also is preparing a response.
   Douglas' petition, filed Feb. 17, asked for a modification of
the ``probable cause'' finding on the crash adopted by the NTSB
last May. Douglas' proposal would blame the crash solely on the
crew and exonerate the warning system.
   More than 100 lawsuits have been filed by relatives of
passengers killed in the crash. Douglas could try to use a change
in the NTSB ruling to reduce its liability.
   Elayne Bendel, a representative of Douglas, acknowledged the
petition contains no hard evidence to indicate when or where Maus
and Dodds pulled the circuit breakers.
   However, she said, ``We feel the highest probability is that the
crew disarmed the system.''
   The NTSB said it was possible the crew pulled the circuit
breaker, but could find no evidence of it. Nor could the board
substantiate Northwest and the pilot association's claims that the
circuit breaker was faulty.

<TEXT>
   Riot police in two cities fired
volleys of tear gas and charged anti-government protesters Sunday
who tried to march from universities into the streets.
   Police and rifle squads armed with multiple tear gas launchers
fired scores of tear gas canisters at 600 demonstrating students
and workers, who hurled firebombs and rocks in the clash outside
Inchon University. Protesters burned an effigy of President Roh
Tae-woo and called for the overthrow of the government.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo who suppresses labor rights!''
protesters yelled in the port city about 30 miles west of Seoul.
   Riot police also used tear gas to disperse about 800 workers and
students who staged scattered street protests in the Songnam area
of southern Seoul.
   Protesters in Seoul took to the streets after attending the
funeral of a worker who burned himself to death April 3 in a labor
dispute. Workers and radical students sometimes commit ritual
suicide in South Korea as a form of protest.
   Protesters and police officers were hurt in both protests, but
police said there were no serious injuries and did not report any
arrests. The number of injured was not immediately available,
police said.
   Rally organizers had predicted thousands would attend the Inchon
rally, but the turnout was small.
   The rally came one day after 46 riot troopers were injured
storming a food factory held by striking workers in Inchon. The
strikers hurled diluted sulphuric acid and rocks at the police,
officials said. Five workers were injured and 38 were arrested in
Saturday's clash, they said.
   Militant labor groups have staged strikes around the nation to
demand higher wages and other concessions. The government has
warned the strikes are a serious threat to the national economy and
Roh said earlier this month that labor disputes had cost more than
$2 billion in lost production.
   Radical students have staged violent protests in support of
striking workers. They have little popular support and are not seen
as a major threat to the government.

   State Attorney General Robert T. Stephan
uses courts to fight crime, but a former employee has mired him for
6{ years in a court fight that cost him a shot at higher office,
contributed to the breakup of a marriage and sent him into
bankruptcy court.
   Stephan, a Republican serving his third four-year term, says he
may retire from public life, although his popularity remains high
and his personal problems do not appear to have hurt his
effectiveness.
   ``I'm going to persevere, but I've had about as much pain as
anyone in public office ever has,'' Stephan, 56, said in a recent
interview. ``God knows that those who inflicted that pain were not
justified in doing so.''
   ``If there is a hell, he's suffered it on Earth,'' said Rep. Dan
Glickman, a Democrat who is a friend of Stephan's.
   The case started in December 1982 when Marcia Tomson Stingley,
who had been fired from a clerk's job in his office, filed a
lawsuit accusing Stephan of sexual harassment. She accused him of
making lewd advances, crude remarks and suggestions of sexual
activity.
   Stephan denies her allegations, but agreed in March 1985 to
settle the lawsuit for $24,000 and other considerations, including
finding someone to buy her house and helping her get a job in
California.
   The settlement required that the terms be kept secret. But later
in that year, while Stephan considered a 1986 bid for governor,
rumors arose that Ms. Stingley had received state money. He
divulged that friends had raised the $24,000 from private sources,
and said he regretted having settled an ``unfounded and
ridiculous'' lawsuit.
   Ms. Stingley's attorney charged breach of contract for revealing
the settlement and threatened another suit unless Stephan paid her
$265,000. Stephan refused and the second suit was filed, knocking
him out of the governor's race, although he was re-elected attorney
general.
   The second case went to trial and a federal court jury last
November awarded $200,000 to Ms. Stingley, who is now 53.
   Stephan has appealed but couldn't afford to post the bond
required to block garnishment of his wages for the judgment. On
March 31, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection from
creditors, which prevented the withholding a fourth of his
$3,200-a-month take-home pay.
   Don Krueger, one of Ms. Stingley's attorneys, criticized Stephan
for avoiding the payment by the bankruptcy filing and said he
should resign.
   But Glickman defended Stephan's action, saying``he has a
perfectly justifiable right to use the bankruptcy court like any
other citizen does.''
   Ms. Stingley's daughter, Deborah Dempsey of San Diego, said her
mother will not comment on the case while the judgment is under
appeal.
   During the trial last fall, Ms. Stingley testified that Stephan
pushed her against a wall and asked her to have an affair with him.
She said she did nothing to encourage him.
   ``I told him I did not want this to occur. It was offensive to
me, it was demeaning,'' she said. Stephan made sexual advances
``numerous times,'' she said.
   Stephan, whose second wife divorced him during the litigation,
has married again and recently purchased a new home. He said his
financial problems might force him to look for other work in 1990
that would pay more than his state salary of $62,832.
   Politicians from both parties agree that Stephan would probably
have little trouble winning a fourth term if he seeks it.
   He has won praise for pushing legislation to guarantee certain
rights to crime victims, and has been a leading voice advocating
solution of the state's prison overcrowding.
   Bill Hoch, a Kansas City political consultant who managed the
campaign of Stephan's Democratic opponent in 1986, said Stephan
remains ``virtually unscathed'' by the Stingley case.
   ``I've been absolutely fascinated with the man's rapport with
people,'' he said. ``It goes to the fact that when Bob Stephan says
he cares about people, they believe him.''

   Quoth the raven, ``out,'' ``help,'' ``come
on, let's go'' and ``let me out'' _ but never ``nevermore.''
   The two-pound bird with a 2{-foot wingspan arrived Thursday at
the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium from San Jose, Calif.
   ``Out!'' cried the raven when bird trainer Barbara Osborn
released it from a traveling kennel into a large cage.
   The bird was turned over to the Humane Society last September by
a woman who reportedly adopted it illegally as a nestling or an
unhatched egg, then found it more than she could handle.
   The bird was uncomfortable except in human company and even
scared of crows, so society officials contacted the Non-Releasable
Animal Placement Program in Texas, which advertised the bird's
needs in its newsletter. Officials at Point Defiance, who had been
hoping to add a raven to the zoo's population, responded.
   The raven has been dubbed Poe or Poette, depending on its sex,
which zoo biologists have yet to determine. Unlike the raven in the
famous poem by Edgar Allan Poe, however, this bird never says
``nevermore.''

   Johnny Fever doesn't work there and
the musical format is country instead of rock 'n roll, but WKRP is
on the air again.
   WNVI-AM in North Vernon, a town of 6,000 people, has adopted the
call letters of the fictional radio station in the 1970s television
comedy ``WKRP in Cincinnati.''
   ``Everybody's heard of WKRP,'' said station manager Shawn Lynch.
However, only listeners in and around Jennings County will be able
to hear the 1,000-watt station.
   WNVI management jumped at the chance to capitalize on the name
recognition when the last WKRP, in Dallas, Ga., decided to change
its name. Federal Communications Commission regulations allow just
one station at a time to have the call letters.
   The station ushered in its new name April 1 by duplicating a
``WKRP in Cincinnati'' episode that featured a turkey drop from an
airplane.
   ``Instead of live turkeys, we dropped a helium-filled,
turkey-shaped balloon over the high school, where they were playing
a ball game,'' Lynch said.

   Some Farmers Branch police officers
were blue about being dressed in brown, so city officials shelled
out some of the green stuff for spiffy new uniforms.
   Police in the Dallas suburb had complained that they were often
mistaken for security guards because of their brown uniforms _ even
by police in surrounding cities.
   The television series ``Hill Street Blues'' didn't help morale
much.
   And then there were all the cars in the area with bumper
stickers reading ``Back the Blue,'' part of a public campaign to
support the blue-clad Dallas police following a series of officers'
deaths.
   City Manager Ron Escalante's suggestion box brimmed with
proposals that the police change their uniforms, and City Council
responded by voting to spend more than $23,000 to buy blue
uniforms, which are expected to be ready next month.
   ``It's been the biggest morale boost we could ever have given
them,'' said city spokeswoman Donna Huerta.

   Last week the hospital group released the results of a survey
which found that the number of Americans who know their cholesterol
level has nearly doubled in a year, and more than four in 10 say
they have changed their eating habits to cut their cholesterol.
   Among 1,016 people age 18 or over polled by the Gallup
Organization in January, 31 percent said they knew their
cholesterol level. A year before, when Gallup asked the same
question, just 17 percent knew.
   That increase in awareness ``clearly indicates that people are
getting the message'' that cholesterol can contribute to heart
disease, said Dr. DeWitt S. Goodman, head of an advisory board on
cholesterol for VHA, which commissioned the survey.
   The survey, conducted Jan. 9-22, found that about two-thirds of
respondents said they had undergone a blood test to check their
cholesterol level, and four in 10 said they had changed their diet
or eating habits in the past two years to reduce their cholesterol.
   The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3
points.

   ``Follow the money'' is good advice to anyone
trying to sort out the complexities of a political fight, but
following the debate on the savings and loan crisis almost requires
an accounting degree.
   At the heart of the contentious battle is the Bush
administration's attempt to impose, and the industry's struggle to
resist, tougher capital standards.
   Capital _ what it is, how it's counted and why it's important _
is not always immediately apparent to people who don't own or
manage a business.
   But, members of Congress have been warring on the question since
President Bush announced his plan on Feb. 6 and it remains at
center stage as the House Banking Committee takes up its S&amp;L bill
this week.
   Legislators sponsoring both the House and Senate bills are
lauding themselves for adopting a get-tough stance, but consumer
groups, focusing on capital as the key pocketbook question, say the
bills amount to paper tigers with soft teeth.
   Unless standards are stricter, they argue, the S&amp;L crisis could
repeat. And next time, the cost could be even higher than the
current pricetag of $157 billion over 10 years, or $600 for every
man, woman and child in the United States.
   The basic concept of capital is simple enough. The owners of an
S&amp;L put up some money, say $5 million, and raise $95 million from
depositors. The institution, capitalized at 5 percent, then makes
loans totaling $100 million.
   Thus, capital is the difference between an institution's
liabilities (what it owes to depositors) and its assets (what
borrowers owe it.)
   The owners can lose their money, but the depositors' accounts
are insured by the federal government and, ultimately, the taxpayer.
   Many conservative institutions believe it's a sound practice to
keep a substantial capital cushion, but that comes at a price. If a
$100 million institution, with $10 million in capital, earns $1
million in a year, that amounts to a return of 10 percent for the
owners. Drop the capital to $5 million and the owners' return
doubles to 20 percent.
   However, if loans go sour and the institution starts to lose
money, what at first seems like a concern only to S&amp;L owners
suddenly becomes crucial to taxpayers who absorb any losses in
excess of capital.
   So, it would seem to be an easy matter to figure out whether an
institution is solid: 5 percent capital is good, 10 percent is
better, 2 percent is lousy.
   Enter the accountants and the definitions. Two percent ``real
money'' capital can be better than 10 percent in ``phony'' capital.
Keeping in mind that capital represents assets minus liabilities,
the key question is: What's an asset?
   Good loans are an asset, so are government bonds and an S&amp;L's
building and the pens in its lobby. But there's also something
called goodwill, an intangible asset representing the value of
items like customer loyalty and name recognition.
   For a thriving institution, goodwill does have a real value for
which purchasers are willing to pay extra. However, if an
institution is sick and has to be shut down, the goodwill
evaporates.
   Say an institution has $100 million in assets: $90 million in
good loans, $1 million in buildings, and $9 million in goodwill. On
the other side of the balance sheet, it owes depositors $95 million
and has a seemingly healthy $5 million in capital.
   If the institution closed tomorrow, sold its $91 million in
loans and buildings, the owners would lose their $5 million in
capital and still be $4 million short of paying off depositors,
leaving the bill to taxpayers.
   That's why the administration calls goodwill ``phantom capital''
and Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, calls it ``doodly-doo.''
   Congress' struggle to define capital and its importance likely
will stretch into June when competing versions of S&amp;L legislation
will be reconciled in a House-Senate conference.
   According to Consumers Union and Consumer Federation of America,
goodwill provisions in both bills open wide gaps, weakening what
are ostensibly more severe standards.
   The bills boost the minimum capital level for S&amp;Ls from about 3
percent to the stricter level imposed on national banks, now 6
percent. The Senate, however, would permit institutions to phase
out goodwill over 25 years, while the House would allow as much as
40 years in some cases.
   That's a big loophole. Goodwill amounts to $21 billion, slightly
more than a third of the S&amp;L industry's capital. More than half of
the nation's 2,700 solvent thrifts have some goodwill on their
books.
   As a partial plug to the loophole, both the House and Senate
would require institutions to maintain at least a 1.5 percent level
of ``tangible'' or ``real money'' capital. The consumer groups say
that's too low and are pushing to double that to 3 percent.
   ``Unless Congress installs unshakable foundation under the
thrift industry, it has done nothing but throw away hundreds of
billions of dollars,'' said Jane Uebelhoer of the Association for
Community Organizations for Reform Now.

   Television talk show host Morton Downey Jr.
said in an interview that his verbal assaults on gays were caused
by a homosexual approach by a doctor when he was 12 years old.
   In a television interview to be aired Thursday, Downey also
backed away from the verbal gay-bashing that in part led to local
cancellation of the ``Morton Downey Jr.'' show.
   ``I won't make a blanket indictment of any group ever again in
my life,'' said Downey, who offered to tape television spots
decrying violence toward gays.
   Downey, interviewed by KPIX-TV via satellite from New York, said
he began counseling seven months ago and has learned to be more
understanding of people with differing lifestyles.
   He said he has at least 20 gay friends with AIDS ``who I will
bury'' _ including his own brother.
   Of the homosexual advance toward him, Downey said: ``I probably
subconsciously held that dislike deep inside of my system.''
   His hour-long, syndicated series was canceled in San Francisco
after 13 weeks last summer in response to protests by local gay
rights organizations. Another station is picking up the show
beginning Monday.
   ``Pressure groups in this country have every right to respond.
They have every right to demand that a `Morton Downey Jr.' show be
taken off the air if it doesn't meet their sensibilities,'' Downey
said in the interview.
   Downey recently said that the show will tone down the the
confrontations that first brought it widespread notice. He admitted
Friday that changes in his show are designed to temper criticism
and extend its life.

   Japanese Prince Takahito Mikasa has won
the third Ataturk International Peace Prize, it was announced
Sunday.
   Suat Ilhan, president of the Ataturk Culture, Language and
History Association, said Prince Mikasa ``was contributing to peace
in his country and in the world.''
   Ilhan said Mikasa, who is the uncle of Japanese Emperor Akihito
and a world-renowned archaeologist, also ``contributed to the
development of Turkish science by directing and supporting
archaeological excavations in this country.''
   He said a representative of Mikasa, rather than the prince
himself, would accept the prize on May 19 because according to
tradition members of Japan's royal family cannot travel abroad for
a year following the death of an emperor.
   The prize is named for Kemal Ataturk, who as Turkey's first
president in 1923-38 is credited with modernizing the country. It
carries a cash award of $12,500.

   Astronaut Mark Lee is something special in
his hometown, and its 4,000 residents are gearing up and counting
down for Friday's scheduled liftoff of the Atlantis space mission.
   His name has dominated posters, billboards, T-shirts and even a
12-page insert in the weekly newspaper as residents await his entry
into space.
   ``As far as the nation is concerned, they wonder who is Mark
Lee, but to us locally, this is big potatoes,'' said Steve Felix, a
clothing store owner. ``It's our Mark Lee and we're going to puff
him up.''
   Two billboards _ one at each end of town _ and posters in nearly
every window of every downtown business proclaim ``Viroqua _ Home
of shuttle astronaut Mark Lee.''
   The bank where Lee's father, Charles, is a janitor has a placard
counting down the days to liftoff. The church at which Lee's
mother, Ruth, works as a secretary held a prayer service and
potluck dinner to honor the family last week.
   Students across the city will gather for an assembly Friday in
the elementary school auditorium to watch the launch. During
liftoff, the second-grade class plans to sing ``Mission Control,''
a song they wrote for the occasion.
   To commemorate Lee's return to Earth on May 2, the City Council
has ordered church bells in the community to sound the moment the
shuttle touches down.
   As mission specialist, Lee is responsible for deploying the
Magellan space probe toward Venus.

   Three prominent Czechoslovak activists
were detained Sunday on their way to meet Hungarian activists in
the Czechoslovak city of Bratislava, emigre sources said.
   Petr Uhl, Jan Urban and Petr Pospichal, all leading members of
the Charter 77 human rights group, were planning to meet
independent Hungarian activists at Bratislava's Carlton Hotel, the
London-based emigre publisher Palach Press reported.
   Anna Sabatova, Uhl's wife, said the three were picked up by
police as they got off the train from Prague.
   She said they were to meet three Hungarian activists. Two were
members of the Hungarian independent youth group, and third was the
Hungarian representative of an independent East European
information agency formed in December by activists from Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the Soviet Union.
   Uhl, Pospichal and Urban are the Czechoslovak representatives of
the same group.
   On Friday, four Czechoslovak activists, including former Foreign

Warsaw where they had planned to take part in an international
human rights symposium.

   The abrupt decision of Tamil rebels to
come to the negotiating table after six years of waging jungle
warfare and massacring civilians could herald a breakthrough for
Sri Lanka's new president.
   However, it might also be a shrewd, pragmatic maneuver by the
Tamil Tigers to consign rival Tamil groups to the political
wilderness and then pick up the fight for a separate homeland, some
analysts say.
   Preparations for peace talks between the rebels and the
government are likely to start in earnest this week with the
arrival of the leader of the rebel delegation, Anton Balasingham.
He is a Sri Lankan native who holds British citizenship and lives
in London.
   The government has blamed the Tigers for the deaths of about
9,000 people, mostly Sinhalese civilians. However, no major attacks
have been reported since April 15, when the Tigers sent President
Ranasinghe Premadasa a letter saying they would accept his offer
for peace talks.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratna, who also serves as deputy
defense minister, said the Tigers' sudden change of heart may have
surprised the world, but not Sri Lanka.
   ``After what we have been through, nothing surprises us
anymore,'' he said.
   Premadasa took office in January, replacing Junius R.
Jayewardene, who had governed since 1977.
   Early this month, Premadasa declared he was ready to go anywhere
in the country to meet the Tigers. He also offered them amnesty,
jobs, measures to ensure better treatment of their ethnic minority,
and seats in Parliament if they gave up their insurrection.
   Premadasa belongs to the Sinhalese majority, which has dominated
Sri Lanka since independence from Britain in 1949. Sinhalese, who
are mostly Buddhists, comprise 75 percent of the 16 million people
on this island off India's southern coast.
   The Tamils, who account for 18 percent, are mostly Hindus and
say they suffer discrimination under the Sinhalese.
   Tamil sources say the Tigers will ask Premadasa to dissolve a
newly created joint administrative council for Northern and Eastern
provinces and order new elections with Tiger participation.
   The government put in motion a plan for greater Tamil autonomy
after an accord with India in 1987. India, which has millions of
its own Tamils, sent in peacekeeping troops under the pact.
   When the Tigers refused to participate in the provincial
elections, rival Tamil groups that once fought beside the Tigers
swept the balloting. The Tigers began to attack troops from India,
once viewed as their protector.
   The autonomy plan also generated a backlash by militant
Sinhalese, who mounted attacks in an effort to force the government
into tougher treatment of the Tamils.
   An independent Tamil and veteran of the political scene
suggested the Tigers' sudden willingness to talk peace may stem
from a desire to dislodge their former allies from the political
front. Afterward, the Tigers might resume their fight for a
separate homeland in the northeast, he said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The Tigers are also expected to demand withdrawal of the Indian
forces. The president has also called for a pullout.
   The Tamil source, however, questioned whether India would give
Premadasa a free hand to negotiate with the rebels.
   An Indian government spokeswoman said her government would
welcome such talks.
   ``India's whole purpose of signing the (1987) accord was to
bring peace to this country,'' said the spokeswoman for the Indian
Embassy who commented on condition of anonymity.
   Many of the guerrillas are teen-agers who have known no work but
war and killing, and some analysts wonder if such fighters will
accept a political solution.
   One Tamil soldier, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
was certain ``the boys in the jungle'' would lay down their weapons
if commanders told them to do so.
   He said they wear lethal cyanide capsules around their necks and
sometimes bite them under orders to avoid capture.

   Thousands of Japanese demonstrated against nuclear
power on Sunday, the third anniversary of the Soviet Union's
disastrous accident at Chernobyl.
   Organizers said about 3,000 people, some chanting ``Protect our
children'' and ``Remove nuclear plants,'' marched in the rain in
Kawasaki, just south of Tokyo, and gathered along the Tama River.
   ``We must be more sensitive against contamination and pollution,
even if such struggles are held far away from metropolitan
districts,'' Kohtaro Yamamoto said as he watched a concert that was
part of the rally.
   ``Various signs indicate that a turning point in the
anti-nuclear movement has been reached after the Chernobyl
disaster,'' said Eriko Hirai, 32, a homemaker who joined in the
protest.
   The April 26, 1986, accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of northern and
central Europe, leading to bans on foodstuffs from several
countries. Hundreds were hospitalized, including at least 31 who
died from radiation-related injuries.
   Elsewhere in Japan on Sunday, organizers said more than 1,000
people rallied in Osaka, Japan's second-largest city; 600 turned
out in the central city of Nagoya; and 300 demonstrated in Kyoto in
western Japan.
   In the western port of Kobe, about 1,500 people demonstrated
Saturday at the Kansai Electric Power Co.
   Despite recent reductions in nuclear power development in some
countries, Japan plans to produce more electricity with nuclear
power to reduce reliance on oil imports. Nuclear plants now meet 28
percent of Japan's power needs, the government says. Utilities
predict that share will rise to 36 percent by 1995.

   The professionals who monitor public opinion
say environmental issues have gained surprising political clout in
the last 20 years, leaving them unsurprised that President Bush
declares himself an environmentalist.
   A new study of public opinion polls, assembled by three leading
environmental organizations, traces a dramatic shift in American
attitudes toward the environment since the early 1970s and
pollsters suggest today's politicians are wise to listen.
   ``The issue of the environment has by now become an explosive
and decisive cutting edge in mainstream politics,'' writes pollster
Louis Harris in a contributing essay to the study.
   One need go no further than the March 24 oil spill in Alaska and
the public's perception of inept and confusing attempts by
government and industry to deal with it to show the interest that
Americans have in the environment, suggest the study's authors.
   In the aftermath of the spill, Bush's positive rating on
environmental issues, as reflected by a pair of Louis Harris &amp;
Associates polls, tumbled 21 points from 60 percent to 39 percent.
   Republican pollster W. Lance Tarrance Jr., suggests the Alaska
spill ``may shape the 1990 election debate (by) mobilizing voters
to feel more intensely about the need to act quickly and
decisively'' to protect the planet's resources.
   ``Protection of the environment ... has become a valence issue,
a basic American value,'' maintains Celinda C. Lake, a consultant
to Democratic candidates.
   She predicted that Bush's response in dealing with environmental
problems _ whether his actions are perceived as substantive or just
cosmetic _ ``will have an increasing strategic importance for
Democrats in national elections and in new congressional
districts.''
   The views of Harris, Tarrance and Ms. Lake were included as part
of an analysis of polling trends assembled by Americans for the
Environment, the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation.
   Since 1970, the year of the first Earth Day and the dawn of the
modern environmental movement, public attitudes about environmental
protection have changed dramatically as shown by the result of
opinion polls cited in the analysis.
   Here are a few examples.
   _Concern about water and air pollution: In 1970, according to a
Gallup Poll, only 48 percent of those interviewed expressed concern
about polluted water. Last year in answer to the same question, 84
percent said they had such worries. People who were seriously
concerned about air pollution increased from 46 percent in 1970 to
73 percent in 1988.
   _Support for tougher environmental laws and regulations: In a
1977 survey by the Roper Organization, only 27 percent of the
respondents believed environmental laws and regulations were
inadequate. By 1983 when Roper asked the same question, 48 percent
felt that way. And last year, 53 percent of those interviewed by
Cambridge Reports said tougher environmental laws were needed.
   _Spending money on the environment: Last year 65 percent of the
respondents to a National Opinion Research Center poll said more
money should be spent on the environment, compared to 48 percent
who held that view in 1977. A series of Roper polls over roughly
the same time period reflected a somewhat smaller but also
significant increase.
   _Protecting wilderness: In answer to a Cambridge Reports poll in
1978, only 19 percent of the respondents chose preserving public
wilderness areas over opening them for energy development, a choice
of 65 percent. In answer to the same question last year 47 percent
favored preservation, compared to 42 percent for development.
   _Greenhouse effect problem: Surveys by Cambridge Reports show a
growing number of people consider global warming as a ``very
serious'' problem. In 1982, only 12 percent believed so, 24 percent
in 1986 and 39 percent last year.
   A variety of other polls cited by the study also reflect an
``unmistakable shift to a more pro-enviromental stance,'' says
David Baker, chairman of Americans for the Environment, a research
organization for a variety of environmental and conservation groups.
   ``The message,'' maintains Baker, ``is that people are mad as
hell about the way we treat our environment and they don't want to
take it anymore.''

   As weary workers in oil-spattered rain
slickers used high-pressure fire hoses to blast North Slope crude
from a Naked Island beach, a state observer hovered nearby.
   ``We're here to help set some sort of standard on how clean the
beach should be when they finish,'' said R.G. Reid of the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation.
   With Exxon's ambitious shoreline cleanup program for Prince
William Sound just gathering momentum, the question of ``How clean
is clean?'' must be answered, officials say. At some point cleaning
could go too far, environmentally speaking.
   ``There are no standards,'' said Robert Pavia, a National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration oceanographer. ``You have to
decide at what point the cleanup becomes more destructive than the
oil.''
   The Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef on March 24, dumping 10.1
million gallons of thick crude oil into the fertile sound.
   The oil has spread in ribbons and rafts for more than 300 miles,
taking the nightmare to several Gulf of Alaska communities
dependent on the sea for their fishing or tourism industries.
   After prodding from Coast Guard Adm. Paul Yost, Exxon promised
to field 4,000 workers, scores of boats and whatever equipment is
needed to clean up about 350 miles of oiled shoreline by Sept. 15.
   Critics, including state DEC Commissioner Dennis Kelso, say the
plan is a start, but it must be expanded to include more coastline
_ in and out of the sound.
   ``There may be hundreds and hundreds of miles of oiled beachs to
be added to the list,'' said Larry Dietrich, a Kelso deputy.
   ``It's going to be tough. Time is critical. They either get more
people out there, more equipment out there, or they won't meet
their deadline,'' said Colleen Burgh, a conservation department
science team leader.
   She said in some places oil had soaked to a depth of 20
centimeters, about 8 inches.
   ``You're not going to get it all,'' she said, adding that some
cleaned beaches likely will give off an oily sheen, perhaps for
years.
   The plan calls for a peak work force early in June. Four Exxon
cleanup crews worked at Naked Island last week.
   The question of how clean shorelines must be before Exxon crews
can move on to other beaches may play a significant role in the
project.
   ``The immediate approach is to hit the most sensitive, heavily
oiled beaches first,'' Pavia said. ``When you get done there's
still going to be oil on the beach.''
   There is no fast, objective method to determine a standard of
cleanliness for beaches, said Pete McGee, on-site coordinator for
the state environmental agency.
   ``There's no time to take samples and send them to the lab and
do the normal kinds of analysis that you would,'' he said. ``It has
to be a visual, on-the-spot determination. We're working on trying
to figure out how to do that.
   ``We're trying to come up with a method where you could visually
observe the beach and say `This is as clean as you can reasonably
expect it to be' and move on to beaches with a higher priority,''
he said.
   Those priorities could include whether a piece of shoreline was
being used by mating wildlife or was heavily oiled and threatening
to re-oil other beaches.
   Burgh said decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.
``There's no magic formula on when we will sign off on a beach.''
   Alan Maki, Exxon's senior environmental scientist, said state
and federal agencies involved will have to set the standards for
maximum allowable pollution.
   ``I'd like to be able to tell you, sit right down and say
`Here's the number,' pull it off the shelf as I can with metals or
other organics. ... `Here's the EPA standard, here's what it says
we got to do.' It just doesn't exist.''

<HEAD>Senate Leader Expresses Hope For Minimum Wage Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said
Sunday he hopes Congress and President Bush can reach a compromise
on raising the minimum wage.
   ``Not every threatened veto becomes a veto in fact,'' Mitchell
said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.''
   Asked whether he believes a compromise is possible, the senator
replied: ``We hope so and we're going to work toward one.''
   Bush has repeatedly said the only minimum wage bill he will
accept is his own, an offer to raise the minimum wage from its
current level of $3.35 an hour to $4.25 by January 1992, provided
employers can pay all new workers a subminimum for up to six months.
   Measures pending in both the Senate and House would raise the
hourly minimum to $4.55 by October 1991 and allow a subminimum to
be paid to some newly hired workers for up to two months.
   Mitchell noted that ``there hasn't been an increase in the law
affecting the minimum wage since 1977 _ 12 years. And the last
increase pursuant to that law took effect in 1981.''
   ``No other segment of American society has experienced such a
period with no increase,'' he said. ``And during that time, there's
been a tremendous and a dangerous polarization of our society.''
   Mitchell contended that ``those at the very top receive a share
of income and own a share of wealth that is greater than ever
before. Those at the bottom of the economic scale receive a share
of income and own a share of wealth that is smaller than ever
before.
   ``We have to do something to redress that wrong. And the
president's policies are exactly the opposite of fairness and
equity,'' he said.
   On another issue, Mitchell said he does not favor officially
reopening the congressional Iran-Contra investigation in light of
documents released at the Oliver North trial which pointed to more
substantial involvement by President Reagan and Bush, then vice
president.
   ``I don't believe there's sufficient basis now to call for a
reopening of the investigation,'' he said.
   Mitchell added that ``having asked the president to provide a
report from the executive branch, I will ask the Senate
Intelligence Committee to conduct an inquiry to determine, first,
if documents were in fact not provided to the (congressional
Iran-Contra) committee, and secondly, if so, why that occurred.''

<HEAD>Romania Pays Off Its Debts But Problems Linger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By imposing harsh austerity measures,
Romania says it accomplished a feat this month that has eluded
scores of other nations: It paid off a huge foreign debt.
   The price, however, was steep and there is no indication it will
mean a better life for Romania's 23 million citizens, who have made
do with rationed food, gasoline, electricity and other essentials
for nearly a decade.
   President Nicolai Ceausescu, who has ruled Romania since 1965,
borrowed heavily from the West to industrialize, and by 1981 the
foreign debt had grown to $11 billion.
   He drove equally hard to repay the debt and reduced it to $6.6
billion in the mid-1980s. In a surprise announcement at a party
meeting last week, he said Romania had paid in full.
   ``This proves the might of the Romanian socialist economy and
opens wonderful prospects for ... Romania's advanc to communism,''
Ceausescu said.
   Although Romania accumulated the debt by industrializing, paying
back the money kept the country from buying foreign equipment
needed to make the industry run effectively. Foreign analysts now
say that buying such equipment may take priority over easing
austerity measures.
   Romania's debt stemmed partly from Ceausescu's choice of
energy-intensive industries such as petrochemicals and steel.
   The country's domestic oil reserves began to dwindle, however,
and Romania had to rely increasingly on imports to feed huge oil
refining complexes built in the 1960s and early 1970s when oil was
cheap. After 1981, Ceausescu ordered strict measures to save raw
materials and energy.
   Food rationing and prison terms of up to five years for hoarding
have been enforced since 1982. At the same time, food exports _
including farm products such as meat, ham and wheat _ increased.
   Since 1984, the government has periodically cut off heat and
light and banned driving cars for four months at a time to save
gasoline, which Romania has sold in recent years to the United
States and other countries to raise convertible currency.
   Gasoline is in such short supply that even the monthly ration of
five to eight gallons per car could not be supplied recently.
   Analysts predict that Romania will continue to export food and
other products to the West to earn hard currency for its industry,
and to the Soviet bloc in return for raw materials.
   Such a policy would do little in the short term to raise
Romania's standard of living, one of the lowest in Europe.
   These days Romanians must line up for hours to buy eggs, cheese
and butter. Crowds gather for ``tacimuri,'' small bags of chicken
wings and necks.
   The food shortages have created a ``language of misery,'' and
Romanians have coined idioms to describe the substandard food
available.
   ``Patriots,'' for example, are pig's feet, which being virtually
unexportable, ``never abandon their homeland.''
   Travelers from Romania have reported recent shortages of goods
such as cosmetics, soap, shampoo, building materials, shoes and
lingerie.
   Ceausescu, the object of a personality cult unrivaled in the
Soviet bloc, has not explained publicly why he wanted to repay the
debt so fast.
   The government constantly tells Romanians that the Ceausescu era
is an ``epoch of glory and grandeur'' and ``Romania's golden age.''
   Despite the consumer shortages, jokes abound.
   ``How can Romanians pay off their debt more easily? By
auctioning off the golden age,'' goes a recent one.

   An explosion outside a Norwegian center for
asylum- seekers broke windows but did not injure the 49 refugees
housed there, reports said Sunday.
   The Norwegian news agency NTB said the refugees were evacuated
to a safer facility after explosives planted in a tree near the Red
Cross center detonated and sent splinters and pieces of wood
through the windows of the building.
   Witnesses told police they saw a man running from the scene
immediately after the explosion, which occured at 1 a.m.
   Police said there was no bomb threat or other warning and that
there had been no previous trouble at the center in Eidsvoll, near
Oslo. The incident is being investigated by local and national
police, the report said.

<TEXT>
   When federal investigators open a hearing Tuesday
into the reasons a forward cargo door was torn off a United
Airlines 747 jetliner, some of the best evidence will remain under
nearly 17,000 feet of water near Hawaii.
   But there may be efforts to raise the nine-foot-square door from
its watery grave 85 miles southwest of Honolulu.
   Nine people disappeared Feb. 24 when the door and part of the
aircraft fuselage, along with seats and luggage, were swept away as
Flight 811 climbed toward 23,000 feet at 300 mph.
   Though two engines conked out, pilot David Cronin managed to fly
the Sydney-bound plane back to Honolulu with no further loss of
life.
   Coast Guard cutters managed to recover some debris, including
part of the fuselage, but a big piece of metal _ believed to be the
800-pound door _ was seen on radar as it sank.
   Lee Dickinson, a member of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said he may be able to announce before the hearing starts
Tuesday morning whether there will be an effort to retrieve the
door. The hearing is expected to last three days.
   Even without the door, he said, investigators hope to learn much
more about the design and certification of the door on the 747-100,
which was one of the first jumbo jets built by the Seattle-based
Boeing Co.
   Those among the 13 testifying will also discuss maintenance,
inspection procedures and practices, human factors and details of a
1987 incident in which the cargo door on a Pan Am 747 opened
slightly on a flight out of London, he said.
   ``Next week, we will try to get a better understanding of the
`what' ... how everything pieced together'' as the sequence of
events occurred in a flash over the ocean.
   However, he said, pinpointing why the accident occurred would
take several more months of investigation.
   ``Boeing would be interested in having that cargo door back,''
said Jack Gamble, Boeing spokesman. ``A lot of questions could be
answered by looking at it.''
   Recovery of airplane parts from under thousands of feet of water
is not unprecedented. Huge sections of an Air India 747 blown by a
bomb into the sea near Ireland in 1985 were recovered, and the
flight recorder of a South African Airways plane was recovered from
the Indian Ocean in 1987.
   ``There is precedence for the deepwater type of retrieval
work,'' said Gamble. ``But it is expensive and it does take time.''
   Besides, said Rob Doughty spokesman for United, ``There may be
enough data without the door. But that's the NTSB's call.''
   Much of the investigation's focus has been on the cargo door,
which may have broken free in an explosive decompression when the
latching mechanism failed.
   United records indicated there had been problems with the door
before the accident, including a faulty seal and electrical
problems requiring the door to be closed manually rather than
electrically on several occasions. However, Doughty said it was
apparently not major repair work, and it was proper to close the
door manually as well as electrically.
   The FAA on March 3 issued an emergency order requiring all U.S.
airlines to reinforce within 30 days the relatively lightweight
aluminum latch mechanisms with steel, so the doors would be less
vulnerable to damage caused by improper closing.

<HEAD>Expert On Quake-Shaken Sites To Help Rebuild Armenian City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American expert in rebuilding cities
after earthquakes said Sunday he has agreed to draft a master plan
for Leninakan, one of the Soviet Armenian cities leveled by a quake
in December.
   Eduardo Lozano, a former professor of urban planning at Harvard
University who has helped rebuild devastated cities in Peru and
Nicaragua, said he worked out the agreement last week with
officials in Moscow and Armenia, a Soviet republic.
   ``I wasn't sure it said exactly what it was supposed to say,
because it's in Russian,'' he said. ``But as soon as I got back I
took it over to be translated, and it turned out to be exactly what
I thought.''
   Lozano, 52, said money for the planning and much of the
reconstruction are being raised by Armenian relief agencies in the
West.
   He said his Cambridge-based architecture firm, Lozano White &amp;
Associates Inc., expects to spend about a year on the project,
beginning in June with an aerial survey of Leninakan.
   The city, which had 220,000 residents before two enormous quakes
and several smaller ones toppled most of its buildings on Dec. 7,
is now a maze of army tents, shoddy temporary shelters and
half-destroyed buildings.
   ``The most haunting sight _ I'll never forget it _ was an old
Byzantine church cut open, right in half, as if with a saw,''
Lozano said.
   Because the quake struck in the middle of the day, many children
were at school, and hundreds were left orphans, he said.
   ``A lot of the population was housed in precast concrete
apartment buildings that crumbled like matchsticks,'' he said. ``I
knew they were bad, but until you see them, you don't know how bad.
They were instant concrete graves.''
   Soviet officials have estimated that the quake killed 40,000 to
55,000 people in the cities of Leninakan, Spitak and Kirovakan and
in up to 100 villages.
   Lozano said he plans to bring Soviet architects to Cambridge in
late summer for training in urban planning, computer-aided design
and methods of making buildings resistant to earthquakes.
   He said his master plan will call for reconstructing the 75- to
150-year-old stone buildings in the city's center, which withstood
the quake much better than the newer apartment blocks on the
outskirts.
   He would like to see a new city hub built north of the city,
with athletic facilities, schools and shops.
   Instead of large orphanages, Lozano said he will call for dozens
of small group homes linked to schools.
   ``Those kids should not be in an institution, and they should
not be torn from their roots and sent to other cities,'' he said.
   A native of Argentina, Lozano came to the United States in 1962
to study architecture and urban design. After receiving a doctorate
from Harvard, he taught at Harvard and Princeton universities and
then founded his firm in 1974.
   Lozano said he was contacted by Soviet officials a few days
after the quake, when a delegation from Yerevan, the Armenian
capital, visited Cambridge, its American sister city.
   Although his firm's payment depends on the success of
independent fund-raising efforts, Lozano said he is not concerned
about the fees.
   ``I'm committed to do it, no matter what,'' he said. ``This is
what I live for. I don't have a yacht. I don't ski. I love what I
do _ which is to plan cities.''

<HEAD>Rural Mailman Is Suspended For Using Term `Junk Mail'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rural postal carrier who called
bulk-rate advertising ``junk mail'' in a newspaper interview, and
said the best parts of his job were payday and quitting time, will
be suspended for two weeks without pay.
   Richard Mendenhall, a 23-year veteran of the U.S. Postal
Service, will be suspended from May 20 to June 2 for ``conduct
unbecoming a postal employee,'' according to his suspension
documents. The suspension will cost him about $1,300 in pay, he
said.
   Mendenhall, 47, says some of his co-workers at the Xenia Post
Office use ``junk mail'' to describe many of the third-class
mailings he delivers each day.
   ``The public calls it junk mail, but the post office wants it
called BBM, bulk-rate business mail,'' Mendenhall said by telephone
Saturday night from Xenia, a town of about 24,000 in west-central
Ohio.
   ``I wasn't bad-mouthing the post office or anything. I just was
saying what other people say.''
   An entry in the third college edition of Webster's New World
Dictionary defines junk mail as advertisements or solicitations
``mailed in large quantities, often by third-class and addressed
only to `occupant.'''
   Xenia Postmaster Joyce Clay-Sanders refused to discuss the
suspension. Kent Hartway, an official in the labor relations
division of the Dayton Post Office, which has authority over the
Xenia office, also refused to comment.
   A March 27 story in The Xenia Daily Gazette quoted Mendenhall as
saying he had not adopted the post office's preferred term for his
daily load of bulk-rate advertising.
   ``I still call it junk,'' he said in the story. ``It was junk 20
years ago. The customers will tell me that, too.''
   Mendenhall also complained about glossy folders in which
multiple circulars are placed as part of an advertising device
known as ``marriage mail.''
   ``They slide all over the place on you,'' he said. ``It comes
apart and becomes garbage.''
   Mendenhall estimates that he carries 800 to 900 pieces of junk
mail, including catalogs, on his 47-mile daily route.
   He also roused the ire of his supervisors by saying his favorite
parts of the job were payday and quitting time.
   ``Everybody feels that way,'' he said. ``They're fussing even
about that.''
   Mendenhall does not belong to a union, but said he would file a
grievance with his supervisor this week.

   Betty Wright's friends have rallied to her
side as she fights allegations that she and her husband, House
Speaker Jim Wright, violated House rules by accepting impermissible
gifts.
   ``She is a strong individual and she's always been very nice to
me,'' said Phyllis Coehlo, the wife of Rep. Tony Coehlo, D-Calif.,
the House majority whip.
   Mrs. Wright, an adoptive Texan who came to Washington as a
secretary in Wright's congressional office 24 years ago, has tried
to avoid the limelight since the House Ethics Committee concluded
last week that her husband violated 69 rules. Some of the
allegations stem from her employment by Wright's friends.
   In an interview with the Washington Post, Mrs. Wright staunchly
defended the couples' conduct, calling her husband ``the most
honest man I know.''
   ``Neither Jim nor I ever intended to evade the law in any way,
shape or form,'' she said. ``My God, he's been there for 30 years.
Why all of a sudden would he do a shady thing like that?''
   One of the allegations made by the ethics committee was that
Mrs. Wright failed to do any work for a company called Mallightco,
jointly owned by Wright and George Mallick, a developer in Fort
Worth, Texas, the city Wright represents. Mallightco paid Mrs.
Wright $18,000 a year between 1981 and 1984.
   Mrs. Wright, 65, bristled at the suggestion of the ethics
committee that she wasn't qualified to handle investments for
Mallightco.
   ``Common sense and judgment stand for something,'' she said. ``I
know lots of men who don't have specific business experience and
have made lots of money in business.''
   Mrs. Wright's friends described her as an organized, take-charge
person whose administrative skills were honed in the years she
spent working as a secretary on Capitol Hill and in Texas.
   ``She's more of a doer than I am,'' said Mrs. Coehlo, a
long-time personal secretary to Rep. Andrew Jacobs Jr., D-Ind.
   ``She's a very organized person,'' said Dick Sullivan, Mrs.
Wright's former boss on the House Public Works Committee.
   The life of Betty Wright, the former Betty Hay, has been the
kind that many women dream about, moving from Capitol Hill
secretary to the wife of one of the country's most powerful figures.
   Raised in St. Louis, Mrs. Wright was the only child of a broken
home: she never knew her father and her stepfather divorced her
mother when Betty Hay was a child.
   When her mother contracted rheumatic fever, Betty Hay, then a
teen-ager, turned her love of tap-dancing into profit, dancing in
nightclub chorus lines.
   Later, she graduated from secretarial school and moved to Texas
with her then-husband, a pilot. They soon divorced.
   In 1965, Betty Hay took a job with Wright's congressional office
and moved to Washington. Later, she shifted to the House public
works committee.
   When Wright separated from his wife in 1970, he began dating
Betty Hay. They married in 1972, the year his divorce was final.
The couple, who have a large house in suburb McLean, Va., have no
children together. Wright has four from his previous marriage.
   In 1976, Wright became majority leader and his wife left her
$24,000-a-year job on the public works committee.
   In 1984, she began a three-year job for the Pacific Institute, a
Seattle-based institute that teaches techniques of self-motivation
and counts Democratic members of Congress among its clients.
   Mrs. Wright told the Post she received $36,000 annually for her
part-time work as a customer representative for the institute,
which is run by Lou and Diane Tice. The Wrights, who attended a
three-day institute seminar several years ago, are good friends of
the Tices.
   The former communications director of the Pacific Institute, Bob
Hardwick, said he warned his bosses in 1987 that having Mrs. Wright
on the payroll was ``improper.''
   ``They insisted there wasn't anything illegal about it,'' said
Hardwick. ``I said, `I don't care. It's improper. It bends ethics.
I don't care what your intent is. You're going to damage your
friends,''' said Hardwick.
   Additionally, Mrs. Wright serves on the board of the National
Theater in Washington.
   Despite her outside interests, Mrs. Wright's friends said her
No. 1 priority has been attending to the health and wardrobe of her
husband.
   ``She really looks after Jim _ hoping he gets enough sleep and
things like that,'' Mrs. Coehlo said.

<TEXT>
   Consumers called for a boycott of some
food products to protest soaring prices, and many merchants
retaliated by closing their shops in the latest tensions over
Algeria's crumbling economy.
   Protests against rising prices have spread in recent weeks,
triggering occasional violence. Several dozen people were injured
April 16 and many shops were looted in a riot at the market in the
southwestern village of Aflou.
   Authorities said two policemen were among the injured and that
about 50 people were arrested.
   The Commerce Ministry has promised to enforce price controls
more strictly, and the state-run press has blamed the increases on
``speculators'' and ``those who starve the people.''
   In Algiers and Oran, the biggest cities in this North African
Arab country, posters have gone up calling on consumers to boycott
meat and other products whose prices shot up almost overnight.
   In reply, many merchants went on strike Saturday and threatened
to keep their stores closed if the boycott calls continued.
   ``I don't have to boycott meat. I can't afford to buy it at
these prices,'' Salah Laribi, a 47-year-old father of six, said in
an unusually deserted Algiers market Sunday.
   Beef has jumped in price to about $11.35 a pound, almost double
the going rate a few weeks ago. Tomatoes have doubled in price, to
$1.50 per pound, and onions have quadrupled in cost.
   The Algerian dinar officially is worth 16.7 cents, but black
market traders offer at least five times the official rate for
dollars and other hard currencies.
   It is not entirely clear why prices have shot up so suddenly,
although the Algerian economy has been crippled in recent years by
tumbling oil prices. Oil and gas account for more than 95 percent
of the country's export earnings.
   Frequent strikes by government employees and workers for
public-sector companies have caused still more problems in the past
six months, especially a strike that has paralyzed major ports at
Skikda and Arsez.
   Violent demonstrations that claimed hundreds of lives in October
began as protests of high prices but turned into an attack on state
control of the economy and the authoritarian socialist government.
   The violence prompted President Chadli Bendjedid to institute a
series of constitutional reforms that are to pave the way for a
multiparty system.
   In recent months, about 30 new political parties have been
formed, but they have been discreet in their activities while
awaiting government action to legalize them.

   Eight youths arraigned Sunday on charges of
beating and raping a Central Park jogger joked about the attack and
one called it ``fun,'' officials said.
   The teen-agers, age 14 to 17, joked, sang a rap song and showed
no remorse during their first night in jail, according to published
reports.
   ``It was fun,'' one of the suspects, 15-year-old Yusef Salaam,
said in a written confession, according to Gerald McKelvey, a
spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney's office.
   The victim, a 28-year-old Wall Street investment banker whose
skull was fractured by a pipe and a brick in the Wednesday night
attack, remained in a coma Sunday, said Richard Conte, an
administrator at Metropolitan Hospital.
   The attack on the woman came while the pack of youths was
``wilding'' in the park _ their term for a rampage of random
violence and thievery, police said. The pack started with about 30
members who beat or terrorized nine people before splitting up when
a police van cruised by.
   Seven of the youths made videotaped statements to police; Salaam
gave a written statement, McKelvey said.
   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer told Manhattan
Criminal Court Judge Charles Solomon about the statements at the
arraignment. Solomon ordered all eight held without bail on charges
of second-degree attempted murder, first-degree rape and
first-degree assault.
   ``Most of the statements tend to say that others did things
while `I was there and just watched,' or held her down,'' McKelvey
said.
   Friends and relatives of the suspects expressed shock and some
were doubtful of the youths' involvement.
   Police think about 12 youths were in the underbrush by a roadway
when the victim jogged by alone about 10 p.m.
   According to accounts from investigators published in New York
Newsday, the Daily News and the New York Post, the group knocked
her down with the metal pipe and gagged her with her clothing.
While some held her down and fondled her, at least four raped her.
   At one point, the victim was able to scratch the face of one
attacker, identified as Kevin Richardson, 14. She was again struck
by the pipe, rocks or bricks, and also cut by a knife. They left
her for dead, investigators said, and passersby found her 3{ hours
later.
   In a nearby police stationhouse, the suspects whistled at
policewomen, laughed about the attack and compared notes on what
they had told police, the newspapers quoted investigators as saying.
   They ``appeared empty of emotion ... as if they were talking
about something insignificant,'' the Daily News quoted an
unidentified police source as saying.
   At one point, the suspects began singing the rap song ``Wild
Thing,'' the News reported.
   ``They were bragging to each other about what they had told us
and comparing notes,'' one police source told the Post. ``They were
discussing what they had done and they were laughing about it.''
   The Post said it interviewed one of the eight suspects, who said
the woman put up a fight and was punched unconscious, then raped by
three people. ``We was just going on a spree, going out and
harassing, you know,'' the boy told the Post.
   Besides Salaam and Richardson, the other suspects were
identified as Antron McCray, 15; Clarence Thomas, 14; Raymond
Santana, 14; Steve Lopez, 15; Kharey Wise, 16; and Michael Brisco,
17. All of the suspects are being tried as adults, but only Wise
and Brisco could be sentenced as adults.

   Opposition activists led by Solidarity
chairman Lech Walesa on Sunday approved 252 independent candidates
for legislative elections in June. Walesa insisted he will not run.
   The national Solidarity Citizens Committee approved 252
candidates eligible to run for all 100 seats in a new Senate and
161 seats in the existing 460-member upper house known as the Sejm.
   Candidates for the nine remaining seats open to the opposition
will be selected in the next few days, Solidarity national
spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz told a news conference after the
four-hour meeting.
   Government-opposition talks ended in an agreement April 5 to
lift a seven-year ban on Solidarity and cleared the way for the
most democratic elections in Poland's postwar history. The labor
union officially became legal April 17.
   The government agreed to lift the ban in exchange for political
and economic cooperation from the opposition.
   In his opening speech Sunday to delegates gathered at Warsaw
University, Walesa appealed for unity as the now-legal union enters
``the new situation'' of building democracy in communist Poland.
   Walesa reiterated that he did not intend to run for the new,
freely elected Senate or the Sejm seats open to the opposition. The
Solidarity chief, a 1983 Nobel Peace laureate, said he wanted to be
free to lead the opposition and his union, the first independent
labor movement in the East bloc.
   However, many of the country's leading union and political
activists plan to run as candidates, including longtime Walesa
associates Bogdan Lis and Leszek Kaczynski; senior Solidarity
adviser Jacek Kuron; historian and Walesa adviser Bronislaw
Geremek; political essayist Adam Michnik, and prominent film
director Andrzej Wajda.
   The elections are scheduled June 4 with a runoff June 18.
   Onyszkiewicz said a draft of the opposition's platform was being
re-edited following Sunday's discussions and would be ready Monday.
   Solidarity leaders said the opposition faces tremendous time
pressure in preparing for elections. They also acknowledged a lack
of experience in how to run campaigns.
   ``Social knowledge about the procedure of these elections is
close to zero. We have to start our work on that very soon,'' said
Kuron at the news conference.
   Walesa, who had just returned from a four-day trip to Rome where
he made appeals for Western aid to rebuild Poland's ailing economy,
appealed for opposition unity in his speech to the meeting Sunday.
   Walesa said the opposition was, in a sense, undergoing its most
difficult time. ``One thing is ending, and the new one has not
started functioning yet,'' he said.
   ``It is a new situation in which we have to combine people of
struggle with those of work. And that's why I strongly appeal to
you, let's forget about group or individual interests,'' he said.

<HEAD>Public Housing Tenants Balance Safety vs. Civil Rights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public housing tenants caught in a crossfire
of gangs and dope peddlers see a tough new eviction policy as a
step toward a safer neighborhood despite opposition from defenders
of civil rights.
   Omaha Housing Authority Director Robert Armstrong calls his
agency's eviction policy the toughest in the nation, and U.S.
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp has praised it as
an example others should follow to help rid housing projects of
drugs and gangs.
   The Omaha agency adopted the policy last week, arming itself
with the power to evict tenants who themselves or whose children or
other household members _ including guests _ are suspected of
certain crimes.
   Kemp last week announced HUD actions aimed at easing the
eviction process for local agencies that operate federally
subsidized housing projects. Among other things, HUD is making drug
offenses a specific violation of leases.
   Last month, Alexandria, Va., Mayor James P. Moran secured a
waiver from HUD rules that allow a tenant to appeal eviction to an
administrative panel or court. The mayor asked for the waiver to
speed evictions of suspected drug dealers. HUD agreed after being
satisfied that tenants' rights, including the right to take their
complaints to court, were adequately protected under state law.
   In Omaha, tenants' leases have been amended to explain they may
be evicted if drug or violent criminal activity is suspected inside
or outside the project ``without regard to whether or not any
person whose conduct is at issue has been arrested, charged or
convicted.''
   Armstrong said he will review each case, and evictions will not
be automatic. He said residents will be allowed to appeal in court
and can avoid eviction by arranging for counseling or other
rehabilitation.
   However, critics say the leases violate tenants' rights because
evictions are allowed based on activity off the grounds and without
regard for whether anyone has been charged.
   ``They are basically evicting people because they have criminal
characters,'' said Gary Fischer, senior attorney for housing for
the Omaha Legal Aid Society.
   Armstrong and other community leaders said most public housing
residents back the tough policy.
   ``I haven't heard anyone who lives there say they are against
it,'' said Jesse Sharpe, director of community services for Family
Service, a United Way agency.
   Residents of Omaha's Logan Fontenelle housing project, which is
so violent it has been nicknamed ``Vietnam,'' say the sound of
gunfire often punctuates the night and drugs are dealt openly.
Police have stepped up foot patrols.
   ``I can't let my kids play outside,'' said Tina Jones, who lives
near ``Crack Corner'' in the project. ``My little boy, he's been in
the middle of two shootings. My daughter picked up a needle on the
way to school.''
   Francis Smith, an OHA board member who has lived in public
housing for 22 years, said she supports the policy as a last resort.
   ``I didn't like the idea at first because of the idea of
evicting the whole family because one member of the family got
caught with drugs away from home,'' Ms. Smith said.
   Kemp said last week that authorities will have to consider the
role parents played in drug activity by their children before
evicting entire families.
   Most youths in the projects live with a single mother or with
grandparents who may not always know what the child is doing, said
Avoca Mason, chairman of the Black Ministers Commission.
   Fischer said the OHA should have no authority to regulate
activity off the project grounds. ``The housing authority is saying
by this policy that we are requiring the parent to be omniscient,''
the lawyer said.
   OHA attorney Steven Riekes said the policy was prompted by the
1988 Federal Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which allows evictions based on
criminal activity but does not define such activity.
   ``If the tenant was selling cocaine from his unit and for some
reason he is not arrested for it, nevertheless the Housing
Authority has proof and a preponderance of evidence _ if it can
prove in a civil eviction suit that the person is using cocaine _
then that is all that is necessary,'' Riekes said.

   Moscow's mayor has pulled out of a second race for
a congressional seat he failed to win a month ago, saying he will
concentrate instead on solving problems in Moscow.
   ``Voters justly demand quick solution of serious social problems
that have been piling up for decades,'' Mayor Valery Saikin said in
a letter printed on the front page of the newspaper Moskovskaya
Pravda on Sunday.
   He cited housing problems, consumer goods shortages, public
transportation, public health, and the environment.
   Saikin was among several dozen Communist Party and government
leaders rejected by voters March 26 in the first nationally
contested elections in 70 years. Party and government leaders in
Leningrad, Kiev and other large cities also were rejected, even
though many ran unopposed.
   Saikin ran against Nina Ageeva for a seat in the new,
2,250-member Congress of Peoples Deputies. Ms. Ageeva received 24.8
percent of the vote, and Saikin received 42.5 percent.
   The winner needed a majority to avoid a new election.
   Saikin said in the letter that he was turning down nominations
by two work collectives to run again in elections May 14.

   Crowds chanted ``Fascists!'' and ``Gestapo!'' at
police Sunday who waded into a demonstration and dragged away
dozens of people protesting a bloody clash between soldiers and
Georgian demonstrators.
   Thousands gathered in the afternoon drizzle and some raised
white, blue and red banners, the flag of czarist Russia, before
marching about a mile to the Georgian cultural center.
   There, they raised clenched fists and observed a minute of
silence for the 19 people killed April 9 in the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi. Soldiers have been accused of using shovels to beat
protesters, who were demanding independence for Georgia. The
official press has said an irritating chemical agent was used on
the protesters.
   In Tbilisi on Sunday, thousands of people marched in a funeral
procession for 16-year-old Natia Barhsaleishvili, who died April 17
of injuries sustained in the clash, said Sergei Dandurov. Dandurov,
speaking from Tbilisi, said police did not interfere.
   In Moscow, protesters pushed past police barricades, spilling
onto Pushkin Square and across Tverskoy Boulevard. They hoisted a
Russian banner with black mourning streamers. Soldiers took it down.
   Police stood by in lines while a special Interior Ministry unit
waded into the crowd, singling out protesters and dragging them to
waiting buses.
   Protesters shouted ``Fascists,'' ``Gestapo'' and ``Shame'' at
the force. Those are especially potent slogans in a country that
still reveres the memory of those who fought the invasion of Nazi
Germany in World War II.
   The Tass news agency said 47 people were detained.
   One protest leader, Yevgeniya Debryanskaya, was pushed onto a
bus after urging the crowd to march to the headquarters of the
Moscow city government several blocks away.
   Moscow authorities had banned Sunday's protest and warned it
would not be tolerated. They accused the organizing party, the
Democratic Union, of trying to stir up tension and disorder. The
Democratic Union bills itself as an alternative to the Communist
Party.
   Before the protest, the Democratic Union distributed leaflets
addressed to ``all anti-Fascists of our country'' announcing the
gathering's time and place. ``Perestroika died on a bloody
Sunday,'' the leaflet said, drawing a parallel between President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and the 1905 ``bloody Sunday,'' when
Czarist soldiers opened fire on protesters who were demanding
reforms.
   The leaflet continued: ``We can't turn to parliament with
questions. We don't have a parliament. We can't turn to independent
courts. We don't have courts or laws.''
   Tass accused Democratic Union leaders of ``knowingly risking the
lives and safety of participants in the meeting, and also all those
who gathered.''
   It said those arrested would be taken to the branches of
Moscow's Peoples Court for trial.

   The government on Sunday announced it
would hold elections in three southeastern districts where tribal
militants have been fighting a 14-year-old bush war.
   Chief Election Commissioner A.T.M. Masood made the announcement
on national radio and television that the elections to the district
councils in the Chittagong hill tracts would be held on June 25.
   The announcement came one day after President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad offered general amnesty to tribal rebels if they surrendered.
   Walie Ashraf, a lawmaker, said the elections were intended to
give powers to the Buddhist Chakma tribes fighting to preserve
their culture and political and economic interests from migrating
Moslems.
   The Chakmas say these have been threatened by the influx of the
non-tribal Moslems from the plains into the hills _ a rugged
5,000-square-mile area covered by jungles.
   Ershad said his offer of amnesty extends until May 20.

   Black Muslim minister Louis Farrakhan brought
a fiery close to African American Summit '89 on Sunday, accusing
government leaders of formulating secret policies to perpetuate
poverty and drug abuse among blacks.
   Citing statistics showing declines in white births, Farrakhan
said powerful whites want to destroy the black community to keep
from losing power in the next century.
   ``I firmly believe that the National Security Council of the
United States, and the president, as well as former presidents,
have had this question under serious consideration and have quietly
formulated a policy to deal with this problem,'' Farrakhan told an
enthusiastic crowd of about 1,000 gathered in the New Orleans
Convention Center.
   Farrakhan called poverty a subtle form of genocide and said
highly addictive crack cocaine may have been introduced in low
income areas by people who wanted black youths to ``sell death to
each other.''
   It was the final speech at the African American Summit, billed
by its organizers as a meeting to develop a political and social
agenda for the 1990s.
   The decision to invite Farrakhan to attend the conference had
drawn criticism. He had not indicated in advance that he planned to
attend, and his speech was not listed on the advance schedule.
   The invitations to controversial activists like Farrakhan
prompted black Republican leader Fred Brown of New York to boycott
the summit, which drew only half the 2,000 people organizers had
predicted a week before it began.
   Farrakhan drew a storm of criticism in 1984 for calling Judaism
a ``gutter religion'' and making other remarks about Jews that his
supporters said wre taken out of context in his campaign to foster
black pride.
   In his remarks Sunday, he acknowledged that his views are
controversial, but said anyone who avoided the summit because he
was invited perpetuated a slave mentality, afraid of losing
political support or contributions from powerful political masters.
   Summit chairman Richard Hatcher, former Gary, Ind., mayor who
organized a similar gathering in his home city in 1972, defended
the invitation to Farrakhan. And delegate Sheldon King of Chicago
said conservatives or moderates who avoided the summit lost a
chance to voice their opinions.
   ``How can you not be here?'' said King.
   The summit ended with the presentation of a seven-page agenda
that Hatcher and policy director Ron Walters said will be expanded
upon in coming weeks.
   The preliminary document calls for, among other things,
increased government spending for education, creation of minority
joint-ventures aimed at building capital in black communities,
development of strategies to increase black political power, and
more involvement by blacks in efforts to end apartheid in South
Africa and ease oppression of blacks throughout the world.

   Four colorful balloons rose into the
desert sky at dawn Sunday for a belated start of the Gordon Bennett
distance race in hopes high-altitude wind currents would carry them
into the Midwest.
   About 3,000 people watched as the first helium balloon, the
bright yellow Rosie O'Grady, floated from Ruth Hardy Park at 6:45
a.m., about 10 hours after gusty winds forced officials to scrub
Saturday night's scheduled departure.
   The other three balloons took off over the next hour.
Competitors dumped sand ballast to reach the 12,000-foot level and
catch easterly winds of 30 mph to 40 mph.
   The race is decided by the balloon that travels the farthest,
regardless of where it lands.
   Race officials said they regretted delaying the launch to
morning because balloonists were forced to blow out precious helium
that expanded in the warmer daytime air. A nighttime launch
preserves the cool, contracted gas.
   ``If we would have launched last night we would have gotten more
distance,'' said race director Tom Heinsheimer.
   But he said the gusts of 25 mph Saturday night left him no
choice but to decide on the postponement.
   Despite the daytime launch, the winning balloon still could
travel some 1,000 miles with clear sailing the whole trip, landing
sometime Monday night as far away as Kansas or Nebraska, said
meteorologist Carl Garczynski of the National Weather Service.
   The record in the modern era of the race was 1,346 miles, set in
1981 by pilots Ben Abruzzo and Rocky Aoki.
   On Sunday, three-time race winner Joe Kittenger, flying the
Rosie O'Grady with copilot Sherry Reed, used the most aggressive
launch strategy, dumping large amounts of sand ballast to quickly
reach the strong winds at 12,000 feet.
   Other competitors lifted off more slowly to preserve ballast.
   The race, named for the late New York Herald publisher Gordon
Bennett, was inaugurated in 1906 when Bennett offered a prize to
the balloonist who could float the greatest distance from a given
point.
   In the early years, the event was held at various points in the
United States and Europe. It was suspended at the outbreak of World
War II, and revived in 1979. The race has originated in Palm
Springs since 1984.

   Thousands of Christians trying to flee
their besieged enclave north of Beirut were left stranded Sunday
after a Cypriot ship heading to Lebanon to rescue them turned back
under Syrian artillery fire.
   The 4,000-ton Baroness M had been scheduled to anchor off the
port of Jounieh, the Christians' only sea link with the outside
world, after darkness fell to pick up some of more than 3,000
Christians waiting there.
   But port sources in Jounieh, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the ferry turned back before it reached the port and was
sailing for Larnaca, on the south coast of Cyprus, 130 miles
northeast of Lebanon.
   Port officials in Cyprus said the Baroness M was carrying only
its crew and a handful of passengers who had sought to get into the
Christian enclave.
   Despite the barrage around Jounieh, port officials in Cyprus
reported earlier that another ferry, the Larnaca Rose, arrived in
Larnaca Sunday with 650 Christians after it ran a gauntlet of
Syrian fire Saturday night.
   Syrian troops and their Moslem Druse allies fired more than 100
shells and rockets into the Christian enclave north of Beirut
Sunday, seeking to sever the Christians' escape route.
   Police said about 100 shells and rockets exploded around
Jounieh, where more than 3,000 people are waiting to be picked up,
and a coastal strip running north to the ancient port of Byblos.
   They said the shellfire caused no casualties and did little
damage.
   The firing was minor compared to the fierce barrages that
hammered the 310-square-mile enclave for the last six weeks in some
of the most ferocious barrages of the 14-year-old civil war.
   By police count, at least 270 people have been killed and nearly
1,000 wounded since the battles erupted March 8.
   The artillery and rocket duels between mainly Christian army
units led by army commander Gen. Michel Aoun and an alliance of
Syrians and their militia allies died down Wednesday.
   Aoun, 53, also heads the country's Christian government, which
is vying for legitimacy with a rival Moslem government. He has
declared a ``war of liberation'' against the Syrians, who have
40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League mandate to keep the
peace in Lebanon's 14-year civil war.
   Despite the lull, the Syrians have continued to target Jounieh,
12 miles north of Beirut. They aim to prevent supplies getting to
Aoun's forces and halt the ferry service to Cyprus.
   The two ferries have evacuated more than 13,000 Christians and
foreigners since March 8.
   They no longer risk docking in Jounieh. Instead, they anchor
offshore and passengers are shuttled out in small boats under cover
of darkness.
   Beirut residents, traumatized by the weeks of almost non-stop
bombardment, have been living without electricity or water and
suffering from acute food, bread and fuel shortages.
   The French Navy tanker Penhors, loaded with 6,000 tons of fuel
oil sent by Paris to aid the Lebanese, docked Sunday at the Zahrani
oil terminal in south Lebanon to unload one-third of its cargo for
a Druse-controlled power plant in nearby Jiye.
   Police said the Penhors will sail to the Christian harbor of
Zouk later Sunday to unload the rest of its cargo at the main power
plant for Beirut.
   A chartered transport plane carrying 80 tons of medical and food
supplies from Italy landed at Larnaca Sunday. The supplies will be
shipped to Lebanon later.
   A second plane, also carrying 80 tons of Italian relief aid, was
scheduled to arrive in Larnaca Monday.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said in Paris Sunday that
at France's request, the permament members of the U.N. Security
Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union, China, France and
Britain _ have agreed to give Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar a mandate to work with the Arab League to seek peace in
Lebanon.

   Iran and Iraq on Sunday ended their U.N.-sponsored
peace talks without progress, and they will be asked to reconvene,
possibly in June, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said.
   The Iraqi and Iranian foreign ministers held five hours of
direct talks since Thursday, but they repeatedly accused each other
of blocking progress in efforts to gain a settlement of their
8-year-old war.
   Perez de Cuellar, who presided over the negotiations at Geneva's
U.N. building, told reporters both sides had recommitted themselves
``to the full implementation of Resolution 598, the upholding of
the cease-fire and the pursuit of the process.''
   U.N. Resolution 598 forms the basis for the periodic peace talks
that began Aug. 25, five days after a U.N.-supervised cease-fire
went into effect.
   Iran and Iraq went to war in September 1980 over border disputes.
   Perez de Cuellar said his special representative, Jan Eliasson,
``will be in touch with both sides in New York for a possible
meeting in June'' between the foreign ministers.
   ``I cannot say this meeting has been productive,'' Perez de
Cuellar said of the fourth round of talks. ``We have clarified
positions again, but what I call progress has not been obtained.
But the process is still alive.''
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said the main
problem was Iraq's rejection of a four-point plan involving troop
withdrawals, repatriation of prisoners, freedom of navigation and
clearing of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway between the two countries.
   Velayati told reporters that Perez de Cuellar proposed a 15-day
period for troop withdrawals but said Iraq refused ``all proposals
that were offered by the secretary-general.''
   Iraq has said dredging of the Shatt-al-Arab, which is Iraq's
main access to the Persian Gulf, must have priority.

   Soldiers shot and wounded 53 Palestinians
Sunday in stone-throwing protests that erupted in the occupied
lands after a call from underground leaders to escalate the
anti-Israeli uprising, Arab reports said.
   The three-day escalation was to mark the first victory in
Islam's war 13 centuries ago.
   In the occupied West Bank, a Palestinian accused of
collaborating with Israeli authorities was found dead. He had been
decapitated and stabbed, Arab reports said.
   The death brought to 443 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising began in December 1987. More than 60 Palestinians have
been killed as alleged collaborators, including two in the past
week.
   Eighteen Israelis have died.
   Those reported wounded Sunday included a 4-year-old boy. Arab
hospital officials said he was shot in the head with live amunition
in Gaza City.
   Two 10-year-old boys also were shot in the head, one wih a
rubber-coated metal pellet, the other with a plastic bullet, Arab
hospital officials said.
   Arab hospital staff said 53 people were wounded in more than a
dozen shootings. The army confirmed four injuries and said it was
checking the other reports.
   The clashes were concentrated in Gaza, a stronghold of the
Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, or ``Zeal,'' which called for
stepping up protests to commemorate the 7th century battle of Badr.
   ``Badr is the day in which good defeated evil,'' said slogans
painted on walls in the seaside strip.
   The battle at Badr in Saudi Arabia was the first victory of the
Prophet Mohammed's followers over Meccan infidels. It occurred on
the 17th of the Moslem month of Ramadan, which fell on Sunday.
   Youths blockaded Gaza City's main thoroughfare with stones and
burning tires, witnesses said. The youths shouted ``Allahu Akbar,''
or ``God is Great,'' a rallying cry of the Palestinian uprising.
   When a jeep from the paramilitary Border Police arrived, the
youths threw stones and the police fired submachine guns, the
witnesses said. They said three youths were arrested and police
closed the city's main market nearby.
   Curfews were imposed on Gaza City's Sheik Radwan quarter, the
village of Bani Suheila and one area in the town of Rafah.
   Protests were reported in at least 10 other towns or refugee
camps in the Gaza Strip, home to 650,000 Palestinians.
   Also Sunday, police in the West Bank city of Ramallah ordered 15
residents of the nearby Jewish settlement of Nili to report for
questioning following reports that settlers set fires and shot up
houses in the Arab village of Harbata in response to a
stone-throwing attack on their vehicles.
   Israel Television showed a Harbata shop and a garage allegedly
burned by settlers, and screened pictures of smashed windows and
rooftop water tanks punctured by bullets.
   Nili settlers who appeared on the television denied they were
involved.
   In the West Bank, three clashes were reported. Arab hospital
officials said a 14-year-old boy was shot in the chest in Ramallah,
near Jerusalem.
   The West Bank man reported decapitated was identified as Ahmad
Mustafa Fashafsheh, 35, and sources said his body was found in his
home village of Zababdeh, near Jenin. He was described as head of a
gang that blackmailed Palestinians.
   In the West Bank village of Artas, near Bethlehem, about 15
people were arrested Saturday following the slaying of an alleged
collaborator Thursday, Arab reports said.
   Meanwhile, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency published a
statement saying more than 24,700 Palestinians have been injured by
the Israeli army since the start of the uprising. It said the
victims suffered injuries from gunshots, beatings, rubber bullets
and tear gas.
   The Israeli newspaper Maariv said the number of anti-Israeli
incidents by Arabs within Israel has increased six-fold this year.
About 100 incidents of stoning cars, throwing firebombs or painting
anti-Israeli slogans were reported in 1988, compared to about 600
so far this year, the paper said.

<HEAD>Focus Shifts To Texas And Oil Well Deal</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs at end to add details; no pickup</HEAD>

   The House ethics committee investigation of
Speaker Jim Wright moves to San Antonio this week, where panel
members will interview the Texas businessmen involved in an oil
well investment that netted large profits for the blind trust held
for the embattled Democratic lawmaker.
   Two committee members and panel investigators reportedly will
spend three days in Texas, beginning Monday, to interview San
Antonio financier Morris Jaffe; his business associate and son,
M.D. (Doug) Jaffee Jr., and two others involved in the oil well
deal.
   At the same time, Wright's lawyer in Washington, William C.
Oldaker, is expected to continue negotiations with the ethics
committee's special outside counsel, Richard J. Phelan, over a
timetable for the speaker's personal appearance before the panel.
   The ethics panel _ officially the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct _ charged Wright with 69 instances of violating
House rules in his dealings with Fort Worth developer George
Mallick, and evading limits on outside income through bulk sales of
a book authored by the speaker.
   Wright denies any wrongdoing and says he will fight the
allegations.
   The first phase of its investigation finished, the panel now
turns to considering whether there is clear and convincing proof of
violations and, if so, deciding whether to recommend disciplinary
action to the House.
   A spokesman for Wright, Mark Johnson, said no resolution of the
Washington negotiations is expected until later in the week.
   The Wright case continues to dominate interest on Capitol Hill,
particularly on a week with little else on the agenda.
   The Senate remains out of session all week on an extended
Passover break and the House does not return until Wednesday when
action is scheduled on a supplemental appropriation bill for the
current fiscal year and the House banking panel continues work on
its version of a measure to shore up the S&amp;L industry.
   The ethics committee said last Monday, in its report on Wright,
that it was still investigating how a Wright-Mallick company bought
a 4 percent interest in an oil and gas well for $99,000 _ putting
up only $9,120 in cash _ and sold it the same day for $440,000.
   Phelan said the committee needed to determine whether Wright had
knowledge of the deal, which involved the Jaffes, a West
German-owned firm, and the blind trust established for Wright in
1987.
   The Wright spokesman, Johnson, has repeatedly said the speaker
was unaware of the transaction.
   A key issue in the overall Wright case is whether he accepted
gifts from people with a direct interest in legislation before
Congress. House rules prevent members from accepting gifts totaling
more than $100 in a calendar year in such situations.
   One of the many companies controlled by Jaffe has sought to
share in an Air Force program, under study by Congress, for
developing the nation's next jet pilot training aircraft, according
to numerous news accounts last week.
   Jim Dement, a San Antonio real estate developer and a friend of
Morris Jaffe, said Jaffe is eager to explain the oil deal at a news
conference _ but only after he has been interviewed by ethics
committee questioners.
   ``He (Morris Jaffe) didn't know Wright had an interest in the
deal until afterwards,'' Dement said.
   The Jaffes' hometown newspaper, the San Antonio Light, said the
two businessmen are longtime Democratic Party contributors, and
that Wright has visited them often.
   According to the ethics committee report, the deal involving the
North Sabine Lake Prospect, in Orange County, Texas, unfolded this
way:
   Mallightco, a company owned by Wright, his business partner
Mallick and their wives acquired a 4 percent interest in the well
from Jaffe Energy Corp. on May 10, 1988 for $9,120 cash. The deal
was arranged by Michael Mallick, George's son.
   The same day, Mallick cut a deal with Union Rheinische Petroleum
Inc., a subsidiary of a West German firm, which advanced Mallightco
$440,000. Of that figure, $90,000 was to pay Mallick's share of the
drilling costs.
   The deal was structured so that Mallightco received $350,000 in
cash, while owing Jaffe no money for drilling expenses.
   On June 9, 1988, Mallightco bought Wright's shares of Mallightco
_ held by his blind trust _ for the same amount made in the oil
deal: $350,000.
   The transaction raised questions because of previous problems
with the well itself, according to the committee report.
   While tests on April 23, 1988 showed promise of hitting oil and
gas, there were ``alarming declines'' in the prospects several days
later, the committee said. ``The well clearly had tapped into a
reservoir containing some oil and gas, but because the well
pressure readings steadily declined during all tests, it was also
clear that the well was not a gusher.''
   By May 4, less than a week before Mallightco made its huge
profit, ``the well had declined to a point that it was uneconomical
to test the negligible quantities of gas and no oil.''
   Because of the problems, Mallick's interest was ``worth a
fraction of the $440,000'' paid by the Union Rheinische firm,
according to the report.
   That assessment is disputed by Morris Jaffe's friend, Dement,
who said geologists were still reporting the well had potential at
that time.
   The well was shut June 9, the day Wright's interest in
Mallightco was purchased by Mallick. The site later was abandoned.
   A vice president of Union Rheinische's parent firm told the Wall
Street Journal last week that he had been unaware of Wright's
interest in the sale to his firm.
   He also said that Doug Jaffe manages the firm's U.S.
investments, and the company made the investment in Sabine Lake
after conferring with Jaffe.
   Meanwhile, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that a Fort
Worth developer, who testified before the House ethics committee
about buying copies of Wright's book, has filed an affidavit
contending his testimony was distorted.
   The ethics committee's report had said that S. Gene Payte
contributed $6,000 toward revising and distributing the book,
``Reflections of a Public Man,'' but received only 300 to 500
copies.
   However, Payte said in the affidavit that he actually had
testified that he received 1,000 copies although he had
acknowledged he wasn't sure of the number. Payte told the newspaper
he has rechecked his records and is now certain he got the full
1,000 books he paid for.
   Payte had bought the books after Wright had declined to accept a
$5,000 contribution.

<HEAD>Marin County Residents To Be State's Oldest, Focus of Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marin County's image may be that of
steaming hot tubs and youthful hedonists gamboling in paradise, but
over the next decade residents may be thinking more about Medicare
than child care.
   After the year 2000, the county will have the oldest population
in the state. The graying of Marin will be the focus of research
about the aging process and a Ponce de Leon-like attempt to
``arrest the downside of getting old.''
   According to a just-released report by the county's Agency on
Aging, Marin's population 60 and older will increase about 48
percent by the turn of the century. The county will have the oldest
population in California while tiny Mono County in the Sierra
Nevada will have the youngest.
   In 1970, 11 percent of Marin residents were 60 and older; that
number climbed to 14 percent in 1980, 16.5 percent in 1985 and
continues to increase. Almost 70 percent of Marinites over 60 own
their own homes and have no plans to sell or move elsewhere,
according to local aging experts.
   ``Persons 85-plus are now the fastest-growing age group in the
county,'' said the report. ``Between 1985 and 2020, this age group
will almost triple.''
   The report predicted that almost one out of three Marin
residents will be 60 or older by the year 2020. The median age is
expected to rise from 33.6 in 1980 to 42.6 in 2000 and 47.7 in 2020
_ almost 10 years older than the projected statewide median of 38.1.
   And one out of every four elderly people interviewed for the
report complained of financial problems, with 45 percent living on
annual incomes of less than $10,000.
   To try to head off trouble in this paradise, and elsewhere, the
Buck Center for Research in Aging has hired Dr. Jacob Brody, a
leading expert on the cause and control of disease, to help study
Marin's aging population.
   ``This is a good group to study because we know they're not
going to retire to Florida,'' joked Brody. ``They're still going to
be there to study when they're even older.''
   The county's eldery provide a ``very stable, intelligent,
well-educated'' group on whom ``basic research can be done to make
it better to be old for all of us,'' Brody said.
   Brody, dean of public health at the University of Illinois, and
William Satariano, an epidemiologist and associate professor of
public health at the University of California, will try to
distinguish between the aging process and the disease process.
   ``We want to divert thinking away from cancer, heart attacks and
strokes'' and toward common ailments whose alleviation will make
elderly life more fun and less burdensome, Brody said.
   ``We want to know how basic science can postpone these
conditions that we just assume are part of getting old,'' Brody
said. ``We want to arrest the downside of being old.''
   The Buck study will look at 2,000 volunteers, with 500 people in
each the age groups 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85 and older.

<TEXT>
   King Hussein arrived home from the United
States on Sunday and began consultations to calm his kingdom after
a wave of rioting over price increases in which at least eight
people were killed.
   Security officials said more dissidents were arrested Sunday in
a roundup in the northern city of Irbid, but they would not say how
many.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in a rare foray out of Iraq,
made a short visit to confer with the king, the official Jordan
News Agency reported. It gave few details of their discussions.
   Jordan was a key Arab ally of Baghdad in Iraq's 8-year war with
Iran.
   Official sources said Prime Minister Zaid Rifai was not among
the dignitaries who attended the talks with Saddam, an unusual
omission.
   Rioters protesting government-imposed austerity measures to
combat Jordan's economic crisis demanded Rifai's ouster, blaming
him for the problems.
   Hussein met with Cabinet ministers to discuss the protests,
which erupted Tuesday in the southern city of Maan and spread to
more than a dozen cities and villages before subsiding Saturday.
The government said eight people were killed and 83 were wounded.
   No new disturbances were reported Sunday. Police and soldiers
patrolled Maan, Kerak, Salt and other cities where rioters smashed
banks, shops, government buildings and cars.
   The protests, Jordan's worst unrest since the army crushed
Palestinian guerrillas in 1971, broke out during the king's
weeklong visit to the United States and France. He canceled a
planned visit to Britain to return home early.
   A 10 percent to 50 percent increase in prices for gasoline,
cigarettes and other goods apparently sparked the unrest. The price
increases, announced April 16, followed more than a year of falling
living standards and rising unemployment.
   The government, faced with a $6 billion debt, had to impose the
austerity measures to secure loans from the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank.
   The violence exploded among native Jordanians, who for
generations have formed the bedrock of support for Hussein's
Hashemite dynasty.
   The rioters shouted support for Hussein but called for the
ouster of Rifai.
   The king's brother, Crown Prince Hassan, said the riots would
not force a change of government in Jordan, a key player in the
Middle East peace process.
   ``Government changes are first and foremost a decision for King
Hussein,'' he was quoted as telling the Saudi Arabian newspaper
Asharq Al-Awsat in an interview published Sunday.
   He said government changes ``cannot take place because of
demogoguery or pressures exercised on us.''
   On his return, Hussein was met by several petitions calling for
a change in the Cabinet and by at least one expressing support for
his policies.
   The Unionist Democratic Association, an informal group of
prominent Jordanians, submitted a petition decrying ``the spread of
corruption'' and calling for new economic policies, a new Cabinet
and early parliamentary elections.
   A similar message sent to the palace Saturday by Jordan's
professional associations accused the current Cabinet of becoming
``more despotic'' and called for a new Cabinet, parliamentary
elections and punishment of wrongdoers in the government.

   Moslems set fire to a Roman Catholic
Church's relief center and Christians retaliated by burning a
nearby mosque, newspapers said Sunday. Four people were reported
hurt, including a nun and a Moslem cleric.
   Police sent reinforcements to prevent further clashes between
Moslems and Christians in Thawra, a slum area in Omdurman across
the Nile River from Khartoum.
   Also Sunday, the government of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi met to
discuss the weekend violence.
   Information Minister Hussein Suleiman Abu-Salih said the
Cabinet, in an attempt to prevent the situation from deteriorating,
called for self-restraint and began contacts with various political
parties.
   The newspaper Sudani said the violence began Friday when an
unidentified Moslem clergyman criticized the presence of the
church-run relief center in remarks to worshipers attending noon
prayers. The newspaper said the clergyman led the arson attack on
the church.
   On Saturday, a group of Christians from the church set fire to
the mosque in retaliation, witnesses said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Sudani and the Sudan Times said the injured included Sister
Maria Victoria, a nun at the church; the Moslem clergyman and at
least two other people.
   Police had no estimate of the damages, and the extent of the
injuries was not known.
   The church and relief center were set up in Sudan in 1985 by the
Missionaries of Charity, the worldwide missionary movement of
Catholic nuns and Nobel laureate Mother Teresa. The center houses
about 140 poor and sick people.
   In 1986, the nuns filed a complaint to police, saying they were
being intimidated by members of the mosque. No action was taken.
   Omdurman Police Chief Ahmed Murtada Bakri told reporters the
motives for the weekend arson attacks were ``personal'' and
religious, but he said investigations showed no link between the
incidents and any political groups.
   The majority of Sudan's 22 million inhabitants are Moslem,
except for about 6 million Christians and animists who live mainly
in the south. Christians and animists comprise the rebel movement
that has been fighting the Moslem-dominated government since 1983
for greater autonomy.
   In a related development, authorities cited ``order and security
reasons'' in canceling a demonstration organized by southern
parties Sunday to support peace talks with the rebels.

   The country's Communist Youth Union has
voted to drop its explicit party affiliation and back the party's
reform wing, news reports said Sunday.
   During a weekend conference, the group voted by a two-thirds
majority to change its name to the Hungarian Democratic Youth
Federation, the official MTI news agency and state radio reported.
   The movement agreed it would not accept the direction of any
single party, MTI reported.
   The union steadily lost members in recent years as it came under
criticism for not representing young people's interests.
   An independent youth group, FIDESZ, was established last year.
It has gained considerable political influence, although it has
said it does not wish to become a political party.
   Imre Nagy, who became the Communist Youth Union's leader at a
national conference in November, was elected chairman of the new
federation by 70 percent of the vote, radio said. Nagy, a
32-year-old mathematician, is viewed as a committed reformer.

   Rain was widely scattered across the nation Sunday, with snow
falling in parts of California and Montana. Temperatures ranged
from record lows in the Northeast to record highs on the Plains.
   An area of low pressure off the central Pacific Coast produced
showers and some thunderstorms across the inland valleys of
northern and central California, and Redding was hit with small
hail from a thunderstorm. Snow fell across the Sierra Nevada, with
4 to 6 inches expected.
   A mixture of rain and snow spread across western Montana and the
Idaho Panhandle. Snow also fell in the East atop Mount Washington
in New Hampshire.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over eastern sections
of the Dakotas, and from north-central Missouri to the lower Ohio
Valley.
   Thunderstorms developed across sections of western Texas.
   Temperatures soared into the 90s from western Texas into
southwestern Kansas as a result of a stagnant upper-level high
pressure system over northern Mexico.
   Record highs for the date included 93 at Concordia, Kan.; 82 at
Denver; 94 at Dodge City, Kan.; 86 at Kansas City, Mo.; 96 at
Midland, Texas, and 89 at Wichita, Kan. Amarillo, Texas, tied its
record of 93 and Pueblo, Colo., tied its record of 87.
   But a cold front had pushed across the Northeast and frost or
freeze warnings were posted overnight over sections of Delaware,
northern Virginia, Maryland and West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle.
   Record lows included 24 at Atlantic City, N.J.; 24 at
Binghamton, N.Y.; 30 at Harrisburg, Pa.; 26 at Hartford, Conn.; and
24 at Rochester, N.Y. Tied records included 18 at Alpena, Mich.; 36
at Astoria, Ore.; 27 at Erie, Pa.; and 28 at Providence, R.I.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32 at
Truckee and South Lake Tahoe, Calif., to 98 at Lubbock, Texas, and
Medicine Lodge, Kan. Sunday's low in the 40 contiguous states was
17 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from North Dakota across the upper Mississippi Valley, the upper
Great Lakes and the lower Ohio Valley to the coast of the
Carolinas. Showers were expected across much of the Pacific Coast
and inland across Idaho and northern Nevada to much of Montana.
Snow was forecast over higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada
range. Widely scattered thunderstorms were forecast over western
Texas. Scattered snow showers were forecast over northeastern Maine.
   High in the 30s and 40s were predicted from northeastern New
York state to northern New England; in the 40s over the northern
Rockies; in the 50s and 60s from the Pacific Coast inland to the
northern and central Rockies to eastern Montana, North Dakota,
sections of the upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes to
southern New England and along the middle Atlantic Coast; in the
90s from western Texas across Oklahoma into eastern Kansas and
western Missouri; and in the 60s and 70s across the remainder of
the nation.

<TEXT>
   The Communist-led National Democratic
Front urged major political parties Sunday to form an alliance with
rebel forces to press for the removal of U.S. military bases.
   The front, whose 12 underground organizations include the
Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People's Army, made
the proposal in a statement delivered to news organizations on its
16th anniversary.
   ``We are building the solid foundation of the sovereign people's
democratic mgovernment, which can be reasonably expected to emerge
within the next decade,'' said the statement issued by Satur
Ocampo, a negotiator in failed peace talks with President Corazon
Aquino's government.
   Ocampo said groups opposed to ``U.S. intervention'' in the
country are welcome to the front and could form part of a
consultative body that would determine the rebel government's basic
elements.
   ``Major traditional political parties and independent groups
could form an alliance with the national democratic forces for the
immediate dismantling of the U.S. military bases and total
opposition to U.S. intervention in the nation's affairs,'' Ocampo
said.
   The offer came a day after New People's Army rebels claimed
responsibility for the killing of U.S. Army Col. James Rowe, who
was ambushed Friday on his way to work in suburban Manila.
   The rebels said Rowe was slain because he was a ``direct
participant'' in the government's counterinsurgency program. The
51-year-old colonel served as chief of the ground forces of the
Joint U.S.-Military Advisory Group, which provides training and
logistical support for the Philippine armed forces.
   The United States maintains six military installations in the
Philippines, including Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, two
of its largest facilities overseas. About 40,000 soldiers and
dependents occupy the bases, while another 100,000 Americans reside
in the country.
   Last week, the front offered to declare a unilateral cease-fire
and enter peace talks if Mrs. Aquino promised to close the bases by
1991, when their lease expires. The front added that it was
``determined to make U.S. imperialism pay dearly for the continuing
stay of its bases.''
   Mrs. Aquino, who refuses to say if she will support the bases'
extension, brushed aside the rebel proposal and said there must be
no conditions for renewing negotiations. The first attempt for a
peaceful settlement of the 20-year-old rebellion collapsed two
years ago over differences between the government and rebel agendas.
   Government troops tightened security around U.S. installations
and at Manila's international airport following Friday's attack,
which came two weeks after rebels bombed a U.S. communications
station in the northern province of Benguet. There were no injuries
in the bombing.

   Anfield Stadium closed its gates
Sunday evening, bringing to an end the weeklong procession of
soccer fans paying respects to the 95 people killed in Britain's
worst sports disaster.
   The tragedy occurred April 15 at the Hillsborough Stadium in
Sheffield, 60 miles east of Liverpool, during the opening minutes
of a game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest teams.
   In Sheffield, Archbishop of York John Habgood told the
congregation at a memorial service not to lash out in anger until
more is known about what caused the deadly crush at a section of
the stadium packed by fans from Liverpool.
   During the past week an estimated 1 million people made their
way through Anfield Stadium, the home of the Liverpool team. About
half of the field was covered with flowers and scarves of soccer
teams from throughout the country.
   After a brief religious observance at the stadium Sunday the
last mourners left and police closed the gates.
   Sheffield's 1,000-seat Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul was
filled to overflowing for the memorial service that was carried by
louspeakers to people gathered oustide.
   They heard the Anglican archbishop advise against trying to find
a scapegoat for the deaths.
   He said disasters are brought about by ``mistakes, misjudgments
and mischances coming together in a deadly combination. There are
times when it is right to be angry, but anger which is allowed to
spill over before the true facts are known, anger based on
speculation, anger directed at those who cannot answer back, is
merely destructive.''
   Anger now, ``when so much is uncertain ... can only make the
task of learning from this disaster that much harder,'' the
archbishop said.
   Within hours after the disaster there were accusations against
police and also some fans. A government investigation is under way.
   A memorial service also was held in Nottingham.

   A Malaysian trawler fishing boat
towed a Vietnamese boat carrying 44 refugees to shore Sunday after
the two vessels collided in the South China Sea.
   Police confirmed the incident but declined to give further
details, the national news agency Bernama reported from Kuantan,
where the boat docked.
   Kuantan is 120 miles east of Kuala Lumpur.
   The Vietnamese are being held in a refugee camp pending
selection for permanent residence in the United States and other
countries. Malaysia accepts boat people only for temporary stay.
   There are now about 17,000 Vietnamese refugees in Malaysia, down
from a peak of 76,500 in June 1979.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People all over Alaska silenced their
anger and anguish for five minutes Sunday to remember how things
were before a tanker spilled 10.1 million gallons of oil in an area
rich in beauty and wildlife.
   Some hung their heads while others stared straight ahead as if
lost in thought in Cordova, a small fishing community.
   Beforehand, a folk singer played on the emotions of the 200
people at Cordova High School's gymnasium when he sang, ``I betcha
if this had happened off of Kennebunkport, it'd have been cleaned
up the very same day.''
   Kennebunkport is the Maine community where President Bush keeps
a seaside home. Some here have accused the Bush administration of
being unresponsive to the Alaska spill, the worst in the nation's
history.
   Schoolchildren presented a mural of how Prince William Sound
looked before the spill and a book on how they would remove it.
   One child wrote she would ask her dad to clean it up; another
said he would let tanker captains drink only water _ a reference to
the sobriety test that Captain Joseph Hazelwood failed after his
vessel rammed a reef, causing the spill.
   The period of silence was requested by Gov. Steve Cowper to mark
the 30-day anniversary of the spill.
   ``This disaster has almost turned us into people who aren't
human. We've been running on adrenalin just to get things
accomplished,'' said Belle Mickelson, who teaches commercial
fishing at Cordova High School.
   ``We need a quiet time to reflect on why we're here doing this
and to get set for the long haul. A Band-Aid isn't going to fix
this,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, a storm threatening wind up to 30 mph and 9-foot seas
pushed oil to unstained shores over the weekend and forced a
cleanup crew to take shelter.
   ``We expect to have some pretty severe weather for a few days,''
said Bill Lamoreaux, an Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation supervisor. ``It will definitely have an impact on
skimming operations.''
   The crude oil from Alaska's North Slope poured from the Exxon
Valdez on March 24 after the tanker hit a reef in Prince William
Sound, an important fishing area at the southern end of the Alaskan
pipeline.
   Inadequate equipment and a slow response complicated recovery of
the oil, which has been driven by currents to Kodiak Island, the
nation's No. 1 fishing port.
   Thousands of birds and marine mammals have been killed by the
oil, and biologists fear many more will die.
   Fishermen frustrated by the pace of the cleanup have taken to
sea in a makeshift flotilla, using scoops and buckets to gather the
oil that threatens their livelihood.
   Angry letters to the editor occupied five pages of Sunday's
Anchorage Daily News. Comments included a suggestion that Exxon
executives be tossed into pools of oil and a proposal that
residents donate to the recovery effort the dividend checks of
several hundred dollars that they get annually from oil profits.
   ``We thought we could have our cake and eat it too,'' said
Mickelson. ``We're going to have to look within ourselves and ask,
`How much oil are we using?'''
   Skimmers, including the 425-foot Vaidogubsky pledged to the
cleanup effort by the Soviet government, have run into mechanical
problems trying to gather the heavy, wind-whipped crude.
   The Soviet crew on Sunday adjusted its equipment and hoped to
resume sucking up oil gathered at Gore Point, a spectacular rock
outcropping in the Gulf of Alaska.
   Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Dennis
Kelso said his agency believes oil still may be leaking from the
Exxon Valdez, which is being repaired in Prince William Sound.
Exxon and the Coast Guard said no oil is leaking.
   Kelso's agency has asked the Coast Guard for permission to
anchor a vessel next to the tanker to test the water and determine
the source of an oily sheen.

<TEXT>
   Amid the boutiques and trendy eateries of 20th
century lower Manhattan, George Washington stepped off a barge
Sunday to commence a week of events marking the 200th anniversary
of his inauguration.
   The Washington look-alike was really Philadelphia actor William
Sommerfield, who was greeted at South Street Seaport by cannon fire
and a crowd of more than 3,000 as a marching band played everything
from Irving Berlin to Michael Jackson.
   ``He looks just like him,'' said Kris Visconti, 14.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch was there, too. He welcomed ``George
Washington, reincarnated, back to New York City'' and presented him
with a framed proclamation.
   Sommerfield spoke briefly to the crowd through one of those
new-fangled microphones that did not exist the first time around.
``I cannot conceal the painful emotion I feel at being called upon
to serve as president of the United States,'' he told them.
   He had crossed the choppy harbor from Elizabeth, New Jersey, in
a small wooden barge, a replica of a 17th-century vessel, which was
covered with a red canopy and decorated with garlands of evergreen.
   In New Jersey earlier in the day, Sommerfield greeted 200 newly
naturalized citizens and encountered a bit of civil unrest from
modern residents of the colonial city of Elizabethtown.
   Nearly 1,500 people, a third of them protesting recent municipal
layoffs, lined a main Elizabeth intersection in windy 40-degree
weather to catch a glimpse of the mock Revolutionary War hero.
   The new citizens, many of them Asian and Hispanic, were sworn in
outside the Union County Courthouse, which was draped in red, white
and blue bunting and colonial American flags.
   ``Two hundred years ago to this date, the president-elect of our
nation arrived in Elizabethtown, New Jersey,'' said Superior Court
Judge Edward W. Beglin Jr. ``There is a bridge from those events to
today that will by symbolized in these proceedings by the
acceptation of 200 citizens into citizenship.''
   Across the street from the re-enactment, about 500 policemen,
firefighters and their families demonstrated their anger over
recent layoffs in the financially ailing city.
   Mayor Thomas Dunn, who was absent from Sunday's festivities, on
April 14 laid off 144 police officers, firefighters and emergency
medical technicians and 81 other municipal employees. Dunn said the
layoffs were necessary to close a $26 million deficit caused by a
lack of state aid.
   Sommerfield began his re-enactment of the inaugural voyage in
Mount Vernon, Va., last Sunday. The carriage the actor was riding
in broke down less than 100 feet into the 250-mile trek to New York
City, however, and he had to continue on by van.
   His barge Sunday was pulled by a Coast Guard boat most of the
way. But for photo opportunities in front of the Statue of Liberty
and Battery Park, it was propelled by 10 oarsmen.
   Four old-style schooners, a replica of the 18th-century British
gunboat, the H.M.S. Rose, and numerous police and pleasure crafts
accompanied the barge.
   When it arrived at the port, Washington strode down the dock and
acknowledged the cheers of the crowd before climbing a platform
filled with city officials.
   Two-hundred years ago, Washington actually landed at Murray's
Wharf, at Wall Street, not South Street Seaport a few blocks north.
Eschewing a fancy coach, the real Washington strolled up narrow
Wall Street, bowing and tipping his hat to cheering admirers.

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas battled government forces
in four provinces Sunday and fired rockets into the capital, the
government said. Nearly 280 people were reported killed in the
fighting, including 12 in Kabul.
   Pakistani officials denied a report that their government
ordered Afghan guerrillas to attack the Afghan city of Jalalabad in
March.
   But diplomatic sources in Kabul said there were deep divisions
within Pakistan's military and government on whether the Moslem
guerrillas should have attacked the city, which government troops
have successfully defended.
   President Najib has repeatedly accused Pakistan of violating the
Geneva Accords that paved the way for the final Feb. 15 withdrawal
of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, ending nine years of military
involvement.
   Defense Minister Shahanway Tanai, in remarks made Friday but not
released by the government until Sunday night, said the
government's ``patience is not endless. The Pakistani side should
keep in mind that its soil will come to lie under Afghanistan's
rocket strikes.''
   He said that although Pakistan claimed it was not involved in
the war, ``The direct participation of the Pakistani militarists
organizing the anti-Afghan aggression is a clear-cut reality now.
Therefore, we reserve ourselves the right to show a similar
reaction toward the attack of a foreign state.''
   He said Kabul could seek Soviet help.
   The diplomatic sources said up to 8,000 guerrillas have died in
the battle for Jalalabad, compared to 2,000 government soldiers.
They said the guerrillas, who are supported by Pakistan and the
United States, were severely outmanned.
   An Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman said at least 265 people
were killed and 123 injured Sunday in Jalalabad and three other
cities.
   In addition, at least 12 people died and 21 were wounded Sunday
when three rockets slammed into northern Kabul, official Radio
Kabul reported.
   The claims could not be independently verified.
   The ministry spokesman, who refused to be identified further,
said four civilians were killed and 10 people, including two
government soldiers, were wounded Sunday in Jalalabad. He said 79
guerrillas were killed and 51 injured.
   Guerrillas attacked the southern town of Khost, injuring two
civilians Sunday, he said. Government forces returned fire, killing
161 insurgents and injuring 10, according to the spokesman.
   Fourteen more guerrillas died in Kandahar, and 40 guerrillas and
four soldiers were injured, the spokesman said.
   Insurgents also fired rockets into Herat, killing four civilians
and wounding six, he said. Three guerrillas were killed, he added.
   In Islamabad, a Pakistan Foreign Ministry official denied a
report in The New York Times on Sunday that Pakistan ordered Afghan
guerrillas to attack Jalalabad.
   The newspaper said Islamabad ordered the attack following a
March 5 meeting that included U.S. Ambassador Robert Oakley.
   The attack on Jalalabad began March 6.
   ``There is no truth in the report,'' said a senior diplomat in
the Pakistan Foreign Ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Afghans, including the (guerrillas), are very independent
people. They do not take orders from anyone regarding their own
affairs, much less about the conduct of fighting in their
country,'' the official said.
   Queries to Oakley's office were referred to the office of Kent
Obee, chief of the U.S. Information Service in Islamabad. Obee
refused comment.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, on a visit to Peshawar, Pakistan,
where the largest rebel groups are headquartered, did not repond
directly to the report but told reporters: ``We want a political
solution to the Afghan issue but we do not want to thrust our will
on others. It is our considered opinion that being an issue of the
people of Afghanistan, they should settle it themselves.''
   Afghan guerrilla sources said they were unaware of any such
meeting March 5 and scoffed at the idea Pakistan was in a position
to issue orders.
   Diplomats in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there were disagreements within the military and government in
Pakistan over whether the Jalalabad assault was a good idea.
   Shortly after Soviet forces completed their withdrawal from
Afghanistan on Feb. 15, several rebel commanders said Jalalabad, 42
miles from the Pakistan border, would be their first objective.
   But the battle has stalemated.
   One diplomat termed the raid a ``suicide mission.'' He said
there were 12,000 guerrillas around the city, compared with 20,000
government soldiers. He said insurgents need a 3-to-1 advantage to
take the city.
   Pakistan, the United States, China and several Moslem countries
back the guerrillas but deny direct involvement in the war.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The archbishop of San Salvador
on Sunday denounced the ``cold blooded'' assassination of the
attorney general but pleaded against a reaction of brute force and
witch hunts.
   Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas said he lamented Wednesday's
killing of Attorney General Roberto Garcia Alvardo.
   ``But with equal vehemence we want to guard against the
temptation to respond to this violence with indiscriminately
exercised brute force,'' the Roman Catholic archbishop said in his
Sunday homily. ``We hope that the raids on union locals and
humanitarian groups are not the prelude to a witch hunt.''
   Garcia Alvardo was killed in the explosion of a bomb placed on
his vehicle. He was a prominent member of the right-wing Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena.
   A week earlier a bomb damaged the residence of Vice
President-elect Francisco Merino, also of Arena.
   Security forces responded to the bombings by raiding several
union headquarters and the offices of religious and humanitarian
groups accused by rightists of sympathizing with left-wing rebels.
At least 70 people were detained.
   Rivera Damas said the church is seeking the release of detainees
not charged with any crime.
   Violence has increased since the March 19 presidential election
won by Arena candidate Alfredo Cristiani over the incumbent
Christian Democrats.
   Right-wing death squads were blamed for thousands of killings of
suspected leftists during the early years of the 9-year-old civil
war between the rebels and U.S.-backed government.
   The Arena founder, retired army Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson, has
been accused of links with the death squads. He denies the
allegations.
   Rivera Damas also defended a Spanish priest that Merino claimed
belonged to a faction of the rebels' Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front.
   The vice president-elect claimed the Rev. Daniel Sanchez belongs
to the guerrilla faction that was responsible for the bombing of
his home.
   Rivera Damas said the allegations were untrue and Sanchez is
ready ``to prove his innocence before the authorities. He is not
afraid and we reiterate our support for the pastor.''

   One of Mexico's most important labor leaders
resigned Sunday as head of the national teachers' union amid a
weeklong strike by dissident union members demanding democratic
reforms.
   A two-paragraph statement from the Presidential Palace said
Carlos Jonguitud Barrios informed President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari that he was resigning as chief of the National Education
Workers' Union. There was no elaboration.
   Earlier Sunday, the dissidents' National Coordinate rejected a
government appeal for tens of thousands of striking teachers to
return to work.
   Instead, the National Coordinate called for a mass rally Monday.
A similar rally last week drew thousands of people to the Zocalo,
Mexico City's central plaza.
   Coordinate leader Teodoro Palomino told the newspaper Excelsior
that the strikers would not return to work until their demands for
democratic reforms within the union are met.
   Dissident teachers went on strike April 17, shutting down
thousands of schools, and their demands included Jonguitud's
resignation and pay increases.
   Jonguitud's handpicked team is still in control of the union,
and it was not clear what effect his resignation might have.
Coordinate leaders were not available for comment.
   The National Education Workers' Union has a membership of more
than 1 million, making it one of the most powerful in Mexico. The
National Coordinate claims it represents about half of the union's
members.
   Previous administrations tried to ignore the dissidents, but the
Salinas administration reacted to the strike by arranging talks
between the union and Coordinate and offered a pay raise of 10
percent. Teachers make an average of about $142 per month.
   It was not clear what Jonguitud's resignation meant to the
strike talks, which had been set to resume Monday after a weekend
recess. The talks have concentrated on the internal union reforms
such as free and open local elections.
   Dissidents say Jonguitud, who has controlled the union since
1972, maintained his power on the organization through fraud and
intimidation and enriched himself while doing virtually nothing to
improve the lot of teachers.
   Jonguitud has denied the charges and said he is not a rich man.
   Jonguitud is closely allied with the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party. He has been rewarded by the party by being
elected governor of San Luis Potosi state and later to the Senate
from a district dominated by the party.
   In the union he headed a private cadre called the Revolionary
Vanguard and was a permanent adviser to the union's national
advisory council. The presidential statement said he was stepping
down from both of those posts.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of Greece and Bulgaria on
Sunday signed a 10-year economic cooperation agreement and a
declaration calling for the removal of nuclear and chemical weapons
from the Balkans.
   The pacts were signed by President Todor Zhivkov and Greek
Premier Andreas Papandreou following a one-hour meeting in the
Bulgarian border city of Khaskovo.
   Papandreou said the talks centered on the establishment of a
nuclear-free zone in the Balkans and the joint declaration could
lead to the abolition of all nuclear and chemical weapons in the
area.
   Their declaration called on other regional countries including
Turkey, Romania, Yugooslavia and Albania to sign the agreement.
   Greece is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
Bulgaria belongs to the Warsaw Pact alliance.
   Papandreou's plane was escorted by four MiG-23 jet fighters as
it crossed into Bulgarian airspace and then landed at a military
airport outside Khaskovo.
   Papandreou and Zhivkov were greeted by several thousand people
in Khaskovo's main square.
   The economic agreement calls for increasing the number of joint
ventures in the two countries and the transfer of technology.
   Papandreou said a recent decision by Bulgaria to begin
restructuring its economy to allow local companies to negotiate
directly with foreign businesses instead of through the state
machinery would facilitate the establishment of joint ventures.
   The two countries have set up 10 joint ventures under an
agreement signed in 1982.

<HEAD>Black Minister Resigns Rather Than Dismiss ``Mississippi Burning''
Sheriff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MERIDIAN, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black minister resigned Sunday under
criticism for hiring a former sheriff who was charged 25 years ago
in the killings of three civil rights workers depicted in the movie
``Mississippi Burning.''
   The Rev. Evan E. McDonald spoke of God's love and forgiveness in
his last sermon at Golden Grove Missionary Baptist Church before
about 25 parishioners.
   He said he had shown those qualities in hiring former Neshoba
County Sheriff Lawrence Rainey as a guard in his security service
in March 1986.
   Rainey was charged with civil rights violations in the 1964
murders, which were portrayed in fictional form in the movie.
Rainey was acquitted in 1967 of violating their civil rights.
   ``Some of the people real close to me said as long as that man
was working for me there would be no peace in that church. I told
them I'd leave for peace's sake,'' McDonald said prior to the
sermon.
   McDonald, a preacher for 17 years at the church in Meehan,
outside Meridian in eastern Mississippi, said he had received
threatening telephone calls. His security business is ``not
flourishing'' because potential clients are avoiding it, he said.
   ``We teach love. We teach forgiveness. Here are people who
profess to be Christians and they behave like heathens,'' said
McDonald, who planned to preach twice a month at a church in nearby
Alabama.
   Hervy Spinks of Meridian, chairman of Golden Grove's deacons,
wouldn't comment on McDonald's resignation.
   ``That's between him and God,'' he said.
   McDonald said the movie, released in January, had stirred up
racial hostilities, with some of them directed toward him and his
McDonald's Security Service.
   But a local preacher said McDonald had made a mistake in hiring
Rainey.
   ``He was associated with something that's a smear on
Mississippi, a scar on the pages of history,'' said the Rev.
Wardell Tanksley.
   Rainey was among 18 men indicted by a federal grand jury in the
1964 slayings of three civil rights workers, James Chaney, 21;
Andrew Goodman, 20; and Michael Schwerner, 24.
   Church members protested after People magazine published an
article Jan. 9 that made note of Rainey's employment at McDonald's
firm.
   Rainey in February sued Orion Pictures for $8 million, claiming
his reputation was harmed by the portrayal of the sheriff in the
movie.Sheriff Stucky, the film character, is a narrow-minded racist
who helps protect the murderers.
   Some critics have praised the film, directed by Briton Alan
Parker, but activists claim it belittles the role played by blacks
in the civil rights movement.
   Rainey said McDonald had refused his offers to quit the company.
   ``I really hate it for him,'' Rainey said. ``I think it will
finally blow over if they ever quit playing this movie in
Meridian.''

   The right-wing Republican
Nationalist Alliance on Sunday named as its new president a close
associate of party founder Roberto D'Aubuisson, who has been linked
to right-wing death squads.
   In an emotional speech, D'Aubuisson nominated Mayor Armando
Calderon Sol, who was elected without opposition. Calderon is a
longtime friend and defender of D'Aubuisson, who has denied
widespead accusations that he sponsored right-wing death squads in
the early 1980s.
   D'Aubuisson, who represents the ultraright of the party known as
Arena, has been described as the group's ``maximum leader.''
   Calderon takes over as party president from the country's
president-elect, Alfredo Cristiani, leader of Arena's more moderate
wing. Calderon and Cristiani, who led the party since September
1985, have not been accused of involvement with death squads.
   Cristiani was elected president on March 19. He takes power from
the Christian Democratic government of President Jose Napoleon
Duarte on June 1.
   ``Arena will not be the classic government party, Arena is
something new, the rebirth of the Salvadoran people,'' Calderon
said. ``Arena will continue being the party that watches over the
government and its officials.''
   Arena has been gaining political power in recent years. It won
the majority of the country's National Assembly and mayoral seats
during 1988 elections.
   Opposition members in recent weeks have charged that repression
in the country has increased considerably since Cristiani's victory.
   On Wednesday and Thursday, army troops and police raided the
offices of a leftist union federation, an organization for refugees
and the homeless and a women's federation. At least 70 people were
arrested.
   Government and police officials said the organizations raided
were fronts for leftist guerrilla groups.

   A Piedmont Airlines flight preparing
for takeoff was evacuated Sunday when the crew noticed smoke inside
the plane, and at least two passengers were injured, officials said.
   The two, whose injuries were described as minor, may have been
hurt when emergency evacuation chutes did not inflate properly,
officials said. Other passengers were treated at the scene for
smoke inhalation.
   The pilot had backed up from the jetway at Fayetteville Regional
Airport, readying for a takeoff on a flight to Pittsburgh, when ``I
noticed he made a real abrupt stop,'' said Fayetteville city
attorney Robert Cogswell, a passenger.
   The pilot then advised the passengers to evacuate ``and boy,
everybody just jumped off the plane in a hurry,'' Cogswell said.
   The Boeing 727 had 76 people on board.
   A crew member informed the pilot of smoke in the passenger
compartment, said Dave Shipley, spokesman for USAir Group Inc.,
which owns Piedmont.
   ``The smoke intensified enough that he felt it was prudent to
stop the airplane and disembark the passengers down the evacuation
chute,'' he said.
   Two passengers were taken to Cape Fear Valley Hospital for
observation and treatment of minor back injuries, said Bob Hart, a
supervisor at the Cumberland County Ambulance Service.
   Shipley said one inflatable chute was punctured by a sharp
object carried by one of the passengers. He said he did not know
whether a second chute had inflated.
   ``We don't know as yet the exact cause of the smoke. There was
apparently no fire, just smoke from something or another,'' Shipley
said.

<HEAD>Survivors Mark Anniversary Of Building Collapse That Killed 28</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn., (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A memorial service marked the second
anniversary of the collapse of the L'Ambiance Plaza on Sunday, the
deadline for claims in the accident that left 28 men dead and
injured 16 others.
   Survivors and relatives signed a $43 million settlement in
December with the 40 companies involved in the project. The
apartment building collapsed while under construction on April 23,
1987.
   Six other workers have filed separate personal-injury claims
since the settlement, said federal Judge Robert C. Zampano. He
would not reveal the nature of the new claims, but he said the
deadline for claims expired Sunday.
   The agreement did not resolve the question of blame, although
investigators said they determined that the method of lift-slab
construction, in which pre-cast concrete floors are hoisted into
place, caused the collapse.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration in October
1987 ordered lift-slab companies to make sure their lifting systems
could bear at least 2{ times the expected load.
   Union officials say the agency's new regulations are
insufficient.
   Officials of Texstar Inc., the major lift-slab subcontractor at
L'Ambiance Plaza, still deny the lift-slab system caused the
accident.
   ``There's no question we've gotten a raw deal and full
investigation was not done,'' said Christopher Geckler, president
of the San Antonio, Texas, firm.
   Texstar contributed $3 million to the fund for survivors and
families of the victims, but since has hired a team of engineers
who Geckler says determined the collapse may have been due to a
faulty foundation.
   Federal investigators say Texstar has no evidence to back its
claim.
   Two Connecticut congressmen, Rep. Christopher Shays, a
Republican, and Democratic Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, are working to
develop safety legislation for the construction industry.
   ``Texstar might be bitter, but there were 28 men who lost their
lives and the bottom line is it shouldn't have happened and it
might not have happened if OSHA had been more involved,'' Shays
said.
   Union officials have called for a federal agency to monitor the
construction industry and criminal prosecution of contractors or
project owners involved in fatal accidents.
   Relatives of the victims attended a memorial service Sunday at
St. Augustine Cathedral, not far from the site of the accident.
   Under the settlement, the children of the men who died will
receive a weekly income until they are 30 years old and money for
college if they choose to go. Widows get income from annuities
until they are 62 to 65 years old, when they will be eligible for
Social Security.

   A group of black students at Wayne State
University ended their 1{-week-long occupation of a campus building
Sunday after administrators promised to beef up the black studies
program and minority recruitment.
   The agreement calls for the university to more than double
funding of a newly created Department of Africana Studies, increase
the number of black faculty members and offer at least 10
scholarships to black students.
   The protesters, who have occupied the Helen Newberry Joy Student
Services Center since April 12, began leaving the building Sunday
morning. University officials also agreed not to arrest any of the
students or seek any academic reprisals against them.
   The last round of negotiations ended about 12:30 a.m. Sunday,
and the agreement was signed 45 minutes later, said university
spokesman Vern Foss, who declined any further comment.
   ``I'm happy but I also know that what was done here is not
necessarily the end of what must be done to correct injustices to
members of my race,'' said Walter Boykin, one of the protesters and
a sophomore from Detroit. He said he planned to relax briefly
before studying for upcoming final exams.
   As many as 100 students originally occupied the building, but
only 40 to 50 were there Saturday night and most had left early
Sunday, said a campus police officer who declined to be identified.
   The building houses offices that handle services including
financial aid, registration and student records. It was closed
during the occupation, but was expected to reopen Monday morning.
   The final settlement covered 13 of the students' original 17
demands, Foss said. The four that were dropped during negotiations
included a demand that only Africans or African-Americans teach
courses on Africana, he said.
   The college agreed to create 10 full-time scholarships for black
students, while increasing the number of black faculty members from
the current 99 to 113 within three years.
   The increase would raise the percentage of black Wayne State
faculty members to 8.7 percent, which university officials said was
three times the national average.
   Wayne State is an urban campus with about 30,000 students, 27
percent of whom are black.
   The university also agreed to budget $452,500 for the Department
of Africana Studies in the 1989-90 school year. The Center for
Black Studies, from which the department will be created, received
$163,000 in the 1988-89 budget.

   Comedian Lucille Ball was in good spirits
Sunday as she continued to recover from emergency open-heart
surgery, a hospital spokesman said.
   The 77-year-old entertainer, who remained in serious condition,
has gotten out of her bed and into a chair a few times under doctor
supervision, said Ron Wise, spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center.
   ``Every one is very optimistic that she is on the road to
complete recovery,'' he said. ``She's awake. She's alert. She's
talking to her husband, to her daughter, to her doctors, to her
nurses.''
   Miss Ball underwent surgery last Tuesday to repair part of a
major heart artery and a heart valve with donor tissue.

   Tanker trucks hauled the last of the
oil-tainted waste water from a leaking barge Sunday and workers
completed the cleanup of the spill in the Grand River.
   ``The environmental damage appears to be minimal,'' said Roger
Davis of GSX Chemical Service.
   The spill occurred Friday when a barge carrying 900,000 gallons
of waste water from an Exxon plant in Houston buckled in the middle
while workers were unloading it.
   Officials said about 10,000 gallons of the non-hazardous
material spilled into the river about 35 miles southwest of Baton
Rouge.
   GSX Land Treatment, a division of the same firm as GSX Chemical,
was being paid to dispose of the waste, said to be 90 percent
water, 7 percent alcohol, and 3 percent oil.
   The barge was to be towed up river to Baton Rouge where any
fumes in the compartments would be removed so it can be inspected,
Davis said.
   He said the simultaneous unloading of tanks on either end of the
barge apparently had caused it to collapse in the middle, rupturing
the remaining tank.
   The spill, which occurred on the edge of a large marshland
called the Atchafalaya Basin, killed some fish, but authorities
said it was quickly contained.

   Neo-Nazi skinheads ended a weekend
rally Sunday without confronting anti-racist marchers nearby who
outnumbered them by more than 10 to 1.
   Thirty to 40 skinheads gathered at the 20-acre rural compound of
white supremacist Richard Butler for most of the three-day meeting,
which included a cross-burning and lectures by Ku Klux Klansmen.
   The only arrest came Sunday after two skinheads spun their car
out of the compound and swerved into a ditch. Officers handcuffed
the driver, identified as Wyatt J. Brook, 19, and charged him with
driving with a suspended license.
   Kootenai County Sheriff's captain Tom Dickson said officers
found a .30-caliber carbine rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun in the
car's trunk. Dickson said officials didn't know whether the
firearms were legally owned.
   On Saturday night, from a police command post set up in a field
a half-mile from the compound, the lights of torches could be seen
bobbing through the trees during the cross-burning.
   Shouts of ``Hail Victory!'' and the strains of German martial
music floated through the night air.
   About 500 anti-racist demonstrators from around the Pacific
Northwest marched seven miles down a highway near the compound on
Saturday.
   They rallied in a field two miles from Butler's compound,
carrying banners proclaiming ``Friends Come In All Colors'' and
``Northwest Nazi Homeland? Never!''
   ``They are not just going to go away if we ignore them,'' said
Spencer Hamm, a black man from Spokane, Wash., who found an 8-foot
cross burning in his yard last August. ``We have to march. We have
to oppose them at every turn.''
   Attendance at both the conference and counterdemonstration was
much lower than predicted.
   At one point, officials were bracing for up to 250 skinheads and
up to 2,000 marchers.
   The small band of stubble-headed, black-jacketed youths who
showed up is evidence of Butler's inability to attract recruits,
local civil rights activists said.
   Butler, 71, has said he envisions the Pacific Northwest as an
all-white homeland, but his Aryan Nations church has been weakened
by arrests of followers and opposition from activists.
   Though skinhead links to established hate groups appear to be on
the rise, the level of organization still seems low, said Tony
Stewart, president of the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious
Harassment.
   ``This weekend is a good sign that other hate groups have not
been able to organize and rally the skinheads,'' Stewart said.
   The coalition was one of several civil rights groups to boycott
the anti-racist march, saying it would give the racist groups
publicity.
   Idaho State Police and Kootenai County Sheriff's patrol cars
screened the marchers as they walked down a paved bicycle path
alongside the northern Idaho highway. A police helicopter hovered
overhead.
   The marchers represented such groups as gay and lesbian
activists, the Washington state Rainbow Coalition and People
Opposed to South African Apartheid.
   During the march Saturday, about two dozen participants in the
white supremacist gathering goose-stepped down the 200-foot road
leading to their compound to meet with reporters. Earlier, they
canceled a march of their own, saying skinheads did not want to
catch AIDS from the demonstrators.
   A shaven-headed youth who identified himself only as ``White
Man'' said the skinhead gathering, though small, should not be
taken lightly.
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of racists out there,'' he
said. ``We're the spark that will start the flame.''
   There are an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 neo-Nazi skinheads in 30
states, an increase in both numbers and geography since a 1988
report, said Marvin Stern, regional director in Seattle for the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
   Many skinhead organizations do not espouse neo-Nazi beliefs, but
the conference demonstrates right-wing leaders' attempts to recruit
them, he said.

<TEXT>
   The surviving daughter of accused
murderer Ramon Salcido looked forward to ice cream and cake at a
festive third birthday party Monday as she recovered from a slashed
throat allegedly inflicted by her father.
   Authorities at Petaluma Valley Hospital planned the celebration
for Carmina Salcido, and for surviving relatives and hospital staff
who have cared for her since she was discovered in pajamas,
bleeding and crying for her mother in a Sonoma County dump April 15.
   Her sisters, Sofia, 4, and Theresa, 1, were found dead nearby on
the garbage heap, their throats slit.
   A newspaper reported Sunday that, contrary to initial accounts,
investigators believe the three girls were the first of Salcido's
victims during the April 14 rampage.
   The Santa Rosa Press Democrat, citing unnamed law enforcement
sources, said Salcido slashed his daughter's throats about 6 a.m.,
then drove to Cotati to kill his mother-in-law and her two
daughters. He returned to his home in nearby Boyes Hot Springs to
slay his wife and went to Grand Cru to fatally shoot his co-worker,
Tracy Toovey.
   The killing spree ended a few minutes later when Salcido shot
and wounded another worker, Kenneth Butti, and tried to shoot
Butti's wife, Terri, the newspaper reported.
   It said Salcido gave investigators details of the spree while he
was en route back to Sonoma County last Thursday.
   Salcido's daughters weren't found until Saturday afternoon, more
than 30 hours after he left them at the dump, according to the
newspaper's account. He was arrested Wednesday in Mexico and
deported to the United States.
   Salcido has said the murderous rampage was triggered by his
belief that his wife and Toovey were having an affair.
   He is scheduled to enter a plea to the seven murder charges on
May 5.
   While her father read Louis L'Amour novels under 24-hour suicide
watch at the Sonoma County jail, Carmina was pronounced in good
condition Sunday by hospital spokeswoman Fran Adams.
   Another spokeswoman, Mary Frost, said Carmina has received many
birthday cards and more than 500 toys from throughout the country,
along with clothes, antique dolls and other gifts.
   Her favorites so far are a pair of white Reebok shoes with
hearts on them, and a pink stuffed bear, Frost said.
   Surgeons on Friday inspected her wound for infection. A feeding
tube, inserted in a tracheotomy, remains, and doctors have not said
when she will be able to speak.
   Carmina is expected to remain hospitalized for another four or
five weeks. Her grandfather and a few other family members have
been her only visitors so far.
   At funeral services last week, her grandfather, Bob Richards,
and three uncles from New York indicated they want the child to
live with family members when she is released from the hospital.
   Jail officials, meanwhile, said a large metal plate has been put
up to keep other inmates from looking into Salcido's cell.
Weather-stripping has been applied around the cell door to prevent
anyone from slipping things inside.
   When Salcido is moved from his cell for showers, exercise or
court dates, the other 50 inmates on the floor are locked down
until the move is over. Salcido is always escorted by at least
three guards, the officials said.
   Jail official Todd Hart said Salcido's only requests as of late
Saturday had been for a toothbrush, cigarettes, his next court date
and something to read.
   ``He's been real quiet,'' Hart said.
   At Grand Cru Winery, business resumed Saturday for the first
time since the slayings.
   Tasting room manager Alan Wastell said he was uncomfortable with
accounts that portrayed Salcido as a ``homicidal maniac'' prior to
the spree.
   ``They want to believe that he looked and acted like a monster
at all times,'' Wastell said. ``As disturbing as the thought may
be, he was not a raving lunatic.''

<HEAD>Frustrated Police Ask Psychics To Help Search For Bundy's Victims</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `Bones and...,' to restore dropped word `south'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sheriff is relying on two psychics to
lead him to the site where serial killer Ted Bundy allegedly buried
a victim, following fruitless searches for her remains and those of
two other teen-aged girls.
   ``It's a long shot, but really that's all we've got left,'' said
Wayne County Sheriff Kerry Ekker. ``I'm not prepared to rule them
out because once in a while they have success stories.''
   In his eleventh-hour confession before execution in Florida's
electric chair Jan. 24, Bundy said he had buried Nancy Wilcox near
Capital Reef National Park, some 200 miles south of Salt Lake City,
in Wayne County.
   Bones and bits of clothing were recovered in March just outside
the boundaries of Capitol Reef National Park, about 200 miles south
of Salt Lake City, but they turned out to be animal bones, Ekker
said. Bundy also said he buried Debi Kent and Sue Curtis in
isolated areas about 150 miles south of Salt Lake City.
   Frustrated in their searches for the bodies of the three girls,
Ekker and officials in two other southern Utah counties are
beginning to wonder if Bundy was getting in a last, morbid laugh.
   Ms. Wilcox and Ms. Kent disappeared from the Salt Lake City area
in 1974. Both were 17 at the time. Ms. Curtis was 15 when she
disappeared in 1975 from a conference at Brigham Young University,
in Provo.
   ``We've dug up all kinds of animal bones, but we haven't found
anything human,'' said acting Carbon County sheriff Jim Robertson,
who is searching for Ms. Curtis' remains.
   Bundy, executed for the 1978 murder of 12-year-old Kimberly
Leach, confessed to dozens of killings in several Western states,
including eight in Utah. He identified only three of the Utah
victims.
   In Colorado, investigators are searching for the body of Julie
Cunningham, a ski instructor who disappeared in 1975 and whom Bundy
claims he killed.
   Robertson questioned the credibility of Bundy's last-minute
burial confessions.
   ``It just seems to me his history is the kind that he left a lot
of people dangling _ even as he went to the chair,'' said
Robertson. Bundy may have been ``getting the last laugh,'' he said.
   In Sanpete County, Sheriff Wallace Buchanan said officials were
ready to look for the body of Ms. Kent in an area that previously
had been covered in snow.
   Buchanan said his office also had received many calls regarding
``Bundy trees'' carved with Bundy's name or initials. Some may have
been carved by joking hikers, Buchanan said.
   The FBI held a weeklong conference in Quantico, Va., in
February. About 20 law enforcement officers from around the country
analyzed Bundy's confession and tried to help each other determine
which victims could be tied to the serial killer.

   Zhao Ziyang, general secretary of China's
Communist Party, is making a visit to North Korea that is his first
trip aboard since taking office in November 1987.
   The official Xinhua news agency said Monday that Zhao left
Sunday by special train for Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on
a goodwill visit.
   It did not say when Zhao would return or give details about his
agenda.
   Zhao began the trip as Chinese university students pressed their
campaign for democratic reforms after a week of rallies in Beijing.
   Xinhua said Zhao is to be the guest of President Kim Il Sung and
was accompanied on the trip by Vice Premier Wu Xueqian.
   China sent in troops to help North Korea during the 1950-53
Korean War. The two communist countries remain close political
allies but in recent years China has pursued growing trade links
with capitalist South Korea.
   China has declared that it has no plans for official ties with
the South Korean government, and Zhao is expected to reassure the
North Koreans that China remains a steadfast ally.
   China publicly supports North Korean proposals for easing
tensions on the divided peninsula and unification proposals. At the
same time it maintains contacts with the United States on how to
avoid violence between the rival Korean governments.

   Two moderate earthquakes far apart shook
Alaska on Sunday, but there were no immediate reports of damage or
injuries, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said.
   The first quake was centered 40 miles east of Kobuk, which is
260 miles northwest of Fairbanks, said geophysicist Bill Zitek. The
location was ``somewhat unusual,'' he said.
   Most of the many earthquakes recorded each year in Alaska are
much farther south.
   Zitek gave the preliminary magnitude of the quake as 5.5 on the
Richter scale, a temblor that can cause considerable damage. He
said the 11:21 a.m. quake was felt strongly in Kobuk.
   About six hours later, a 5.0 quake centered about 40 miles west
of Homer rocked the Cook Inlet area and was felt as far away as
Anchorage, 150 miles to the north, spokesman Alec Medbury said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.

<TEXT>
   The scarred battleship USS Iowa made a
somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family
members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an
explosion that killed 47 sailors.
   Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the
huge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 at 5:41 p.m.,
just one minute later than Navy officials had estimated. Twenty
minutes later, families started filing aboard the ship, exchanging
tearful embraces with the returning sailors.
   ``They wanted to get here on schedule and were anxious to get
home,'' said Capt. Steven Karalekas.
   The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun
turret, which extends six decks down into the ship. There were 11
survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder
from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.
   Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the
fire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full
crews on the ship's two other turrets, the Navy said.
   The No. 2 turret was in the same position as when the explosion
occurred, facing right with the left and right guns elevated. The
center gun, where the blast occurred, was depressed.
   When the 887-foot vessel first appeared there were scattered
cheers by those on the dock, but all remained silent as the ship
pulled into the pier. The somber mood was heightened by the lack of
bands, and few waves were exchanged as the ship docked.
   Adm. Powell Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet,
was on the dock to greet the vessel. As it docked, three Marines
raised a flag to half-mast at the stern of the ship.
   The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families,
and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or the
crewmen.
   The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an
amateur videotape released by the Navy on Sunday. The tape was made
by an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the
firing of the big guns.
   The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like
rubber ``bloomers'' that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed
by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of
the gunhouse.
   The videotape cut immediately to damage control firefighters
spraying heavy streams of water onto the turret.
   Throughout the Norfolk area, churches dedicated prayers Sunday
morning to the families of Iowa crewmen.
   ``We have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way,'' said Cmdr.
John L. Fitzgerald, a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk Naval
Air Station. ``Our faith helps us to handle what science cannot
answer, the mystery of death.''
   A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book
containing the names of the dead were taken to the altar.
   Fitzgerald said the Iowa tragedy and that of a recently lost
Soviet submarine ``put political differences aside and unite the
human family as one.''
   On Monday morning, President Bush will lead a memorial service
in a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people.
   The families of the victims were invited, but Navy officials
said they did not know how many would attend. None of the victims
listed the Norfolk area as their hometown.
   The explosion occurred during exercises off Puerto Rico. The
Pentagon said it happened before the middle 16-inch gun of the
three-gun turret had been fired. The guns, the largest on any ship
at sea, use six 110-pound bags of black powder to fire a
2,700-pound projectile up to 23 miles.
   The Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion,
which damaged only the inside of the turret.
   But Navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the
blast found the No. 2 gun's breech open and undamaged, with the
practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there, The
New York Times reported Sunday.
   This indicated the explosion occurred while the powder bags were
still being loaded into the gun, the Times said, citing
unidentified sources.
   Navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the
bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, the
newspaper said. They said flame and hot gases from the blast went
down the hoist to the lowest deck; if the transfer of powder to the
guns had been complete, the hoist would have been sealed off.
   The Iowa and its sister ships, the battleships Missouri, New
Jersey and Wisconsin, were commissioned during World War II and
mothballed after the Korean War. They were recommissioned by the
Reagan administration in the 1980s.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that the
administration plans to keep all four battleships in the fleet
despite the explosion.
   ``They are effective, they were relatively cheap to bring back
into the service compared to new ships, they are good cruise
missile platforms, so I think they do have a role to play,'' Cheney
said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
   Critics have charged that the battleship's 16-inch guns are
antiquated and dangerous; gunners say they are among the most
accurate available.

   A jumbo jet approaching John F. Kennedy Airport
missed a commuter plane by 100 feet Sunday, while in another
incident a commercial jet reported coming within 400 yards of a
private plane near a suburban airport.
   In the first near miss, a TWA 747 jumbo jet on a flight from
London came within 100 feet of a turboprop commuter plane, said
Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   Both planes were being monitored by air traffic controllers and
preparing to land at Kennedy, she said.
   About 45 minutes later, a Pan American jet en route from
LaGuardia Airport to Boston experienced a near miss with a small
Cessna plane near the Westchester Country Airport, she said.
   No injuries were reported in either incident and Bergen said
they ``were totally unrelated and happened miles and miles apart.''
She said investigators did not know yet how the planes drew so
close to each other.
   Westchester County Airport is about 35 miles north of Kennedy
Airport.
   In the earlier incident, TWA Flight 701 from London's Heathrow
Airport was flying at 1,900 feet about five miles southeast of
Kennedy when the captain reported that Pocono Flight 7636 passed
him about 100 feet above and to the right, Bergen said.
   A nearby Air France jet also was preparing to land at the same
time, Bergen said. The Pocono craft was instructed to land after
the TWA plane, which was scheduled behind Air France, she said. The
Air France jet had just landed when the Pocono plane flew by the
TWA jet, Bergen said.
   She declined comment when asked if the Pocono pilot may have
confused the TWA and the Air France jets.
   The commuter craft was a Merlin SW-4, a turboprop that carries
about 16 passengers, she said. Bergen did not know where the Pocono
flight originated and there was no answer at the airline's Queens
office.
   Bergen said the TWA pilot did not take any evasive action. The
Pocono flight was ordered to abort its landing so the TWA flight
could land first.
   ``This is very unusual for the New York area,'' said Bergen.
   The second incident occurred about 10 miles southeast of
Westchester County Airport at an elevation of 10,500 feet, Bergen
said. It involved Pan Am shuttle Flight 542, a 727, and a small
Cessna 414 bound for Bedford, Pa., that was not under the direction
of traffic controllers, she said.
   The 727 had been cleared by air controllers to climb to 17,000
feet and had just passed 10,000 feet when the Pan Am captain took
evasive action to avoid the Cessna, which can seat between four to
six people, Bergen said.
   ``The (Pan Am) captain reported that the Cessna was 400 yards
away and had a vertical separation of 200 feet,'' said Bergen,
adding that the captain did not say if the Cessna was approaching
below or above the commercial jet.
   ``The (Pan Am) captain turned and climbed in the opposite
direction'' to avoid the Cessna, Bergen said.
   She said the captain's reports will be studied along with audio
tapes and other materials to determine who erred.

   University students throughout Beijing marched on
campuses Monday to begin an indefinite class boycott, one of a
series of protests to press for democratic reform.
   Virtually all of Beijing University's 15,000 students appeared
to be taking part. Students at at least four other universities
also participated.
   At Beijing Normal University, students waving their department
flags marched around campus chanting ``boycott class.''
   Leaders said they believed there was total participation in the
boycott. At Beijing University, a few dozen students were sitting
in one classroom but said they were not there to attend class.
``Our slogan is `boycott classes but don't boycott studies,'''
several students said.
   A student wearing a red armband identifying him as one of the
strike organizers said: ``All the students are taking part in the
strike.''
   He said, however, that if any student wants to go to class the
strikers will only use ``democratic methods'' _ not force _ to
persuade them to boycott.
   ``If our goal is democracy, we must solve our problems
democratically,'' he said.
   A poster in one classroom building said: ``Teachers, please
understand and support our strike. I love my teachers but I love
the truth more.''
   Posters supporting the strike and proclaiming the student
demands for democratic reforms covered many buildings in the center
of campus. Sheets of notepad paper bearing the character ``strike''
were plastered over classroom windows.
   One poster, an appeal to the National People's Congress, or
parliament, and the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, an advisory body, for tolerance of the student actions,
was signed by 143 teachers.
   Students at Beijing Normal University said they were trying to
contact schools nationwide to persuade them to join.
   Outside the campus, students carried mimeographed sheets of the
first edition of their independent newspaper, posting them on
lampposts.
   The newspaper contained accounts of alleged police beatings of
students during demonstrations last week.
   On Sunday, the students took their appeal for democracy to the
streets, making speeches to passers-by and plastering walls and
sidewalks with posters.
   School authorities made no attempt to interfere Sunday. No
police or soldiers were seen.
   The protests in Beijing have been well organized and generally
peaceful, in contrast to marches Saturday in Xian and Changsa,
where rampaging mobs looted stores, burned cars and seized a
government building. Scores were reported hurt.
   The unrest was perhaps the most violent since demonstrations
began April 15, when the death of reformer Hu Yaobang stirred
anti-government sentiments and an organized protest campaign by
university students.
   Many students also called for Premier Li Peng's resignation and
hung posters on campus mocking him.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Monday's People's Daily
newspaper contained a commentary that warned: ``Social turmoil can
only do good to an extremely small number of people with ulterior
motives.''
   About 150,000 people joined Saturday in one of the biggest
protests in Communist China's 40-year history, holding a 15-hour
rally at Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Authorities allowed the
protest, but students alleged Sunday that police beat several and
injured one seriously.
   Worse violence was reported Saturday in Xian and Changsha. The
state-run Xinhua News Agency said rioters in Xian, a popular
tourist city and capital of northwestern Shaanxi province, forced
their way into the provincial government compound and burned
buildings and vehicles.
   It said 130 security officers were injured and 18 people were
arrested. Xinhua said the melee began after students who had been
mourning Hu left the scene.
   A student contacted by telephone said at least 30 people were
arrested.
   Another student, speaking on condition of anonymity, saw about
50 youths began ``ripping limbs off trees and throwing anything
they could,'' including rocks, at a truck of security forces. He
said hundreds of armed security forces in riot gear closed off the
area by nightfall.
   In Changsha, capital of Hu's home province of Hunan, rioters
looted 28 shops, Xinhua said. It said an unspecified number of
police were injured, one seriously, and about 100 people were
arrested.
   No deaths were reported in either riot.
   Foreign sources in Changsha said about 1,000 students from Hunan
University had marched to provincial government headquarters in
memory of Hu. They commandeered a truck and bus on the way.
   But thousands of young street toughs joined the marchers and
began breaking store windows, the sources said. They fled when nine
trucks of security forces appeared.
   Peaceful student marches have been held in Shanghai, Tianjin,
Chengdu, Nanjing and Canton, Western witnesses and Chinese sources
say.

   Gamblers lined up Sunday with dreams of
winning the world's biggest lottery jackpot, but a psychologist
says the chances are nearly 10 million to 1 that many will wind up
with nothing but a bout of depression.
   Tickets were selling at a rate of 750,000 an hour by 5 p.m.
Saturday at the state's 3,312 lottery outlets, according to the
last report from a computer monitoring system, and more than 13
million had been sold since Thursday morning.
   Officials say the Pennsylvania Super 7 jackpot drawing Wednesday
night will be larger than the record-breaking $69.9 million won by
four Illinois ticket-holders April 15.
   ``It's a chance to buy a very large, life-changing prize with a
very small amount of money,'' said Lottery Executive Director James
Scroggins.
   But a psychologist who studies the public appetite for the
lottery warned that many players are in for a major downer when
reality catches up with their dreams.
   ``This lottery fantasy syndrome really heats up when the lotto
jackpot climbs over $50 million,'' said Robert R. Butterworth, a
researcher at Contemporary Psychology Associates Inc. in Los
Angeles. ``People purchase a ticket, ignore the odds and start
thinking of the impossible.''
   Danger signs include spending more than $20 a month on the
lottery, becoming depressed over losses, and sacrificing other
purchases to buy tickets, Butterworth said.
   The odds of winning are calculated at one in 9.6 million per
ticket.
   ``They're out there freezing,'' said Gary Conklin, manager of
Beavers Restaurant in Great Bend, where thousands waited outside in
the northeastern Pennsylvania cold to buy tickets.
   The restaurant called in a police officer to help control the
line that totaled as many as 500 at a time.
   The dreams of the gamblers were as varied as their hometowns and
professions.
   Mary Jo Miles, 32, of Binghamton, N.Y., said she'd pay her
tuition at Yale University. Loretta Chandanais, 21, of Endicott,
N.Y., standing in line with her 8-week-old daughter, said she'd buy
a house and beauty salon.
   ``It's exciting just to see them come in here,'' said Carlene
Haggerty, 40, a waitress at Beavers. ``They all have a dream.
Everybody has a dream.''
   Participants select seven numbers out of 80 in the Super 7
Lottery. The player wins if those seven numbers are among the 11
the state draws.

   An opposition leader on Sunday blasted
as inadequate a new communications law that abolishes prior
censorship and indefinite closures of the print and broadcast media.
   ``It is abominable from every point of view,'' Erick Ramirez,
president of the opposition Social Christian Party, said in a
telephone interview. ``It buries whatever vestige of press freedom
exists in Nicarauga.''
   Ramirez said the new law, touted as one of President Daniel
Ortega's new democratic reforms, fails to authorize private
television stations, something opposition groups have long sought.
   Instead the new law ``guarantees equal access to social and
political groups'' on government-run television.
   The Association of Independent Journalists of Nicaragua also
criticized the new law, saying it would prevent free expression.
   The Sandinista-controlled National Assembly approved the law
Friday and Ortega signed it into law on Saturday.
   Before leaving for a two-week tour of Europe on Saturday, Ortega
proclaimed: ``In no other country in the region are there more
guarantees for jouranlists than in Nicargua.'' The rest of Central
America, he said, ``has exercised terrorism against journalism.''
   Ortega introduced the law as part of democratic reforms he
promised to institute in his country following a meeting of the
five Central American presidents in El Salvador in Feburary.
   He also agreed to move up presidential elections by 10 months,
to February 1990.
   The presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica
and Honduras additionally agreed to come up by mid-May with a plan
for dismantling the Nicarguan rebel force, known as the Contras.
About 11,000 Contra rebels, along with their families, live in
Honduran camps near the Nicaraguan border.
   The new law establishes sanctions for disseminating information
deemed contrary to the interests of the state, for ``altering''
government press releases, communiques and other statments and for
the ``transmission, diffusion, publication or projection of
injurious, defamatory or false information.''
   Although it abolishes prior censorship and indefinte closure of
newspapers and broadcast stations, the new law will allow the
Interior Ministry to order closures of up to four days and gives it
the power to order an offending broadcaster or publisher to issue a
retraction, clarification or correction.
   Broadcasters and publishers will have the right to a hearing
before sanctions are applied.
   Under previous practice, the ministry had the power to order
indefinite shutdowns without hearings.
   The opposition daily La Prensa said in an editorial this
weekend, ``Ortega also did not fulfill his promise to allow private
television broadcasts in Nicaragua, condemning for always the
Nicaraguan people to state television that transmit the Oretegist
image every minute.''
   ``His law, which he dares to describe as the best in Central
America, continues to contain grave threats to the excercise of
liberty of expression in Nicargua,'' La Prensa said.

<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emilio G. Segre, a nuclear physicist who
shared the Nobel Prize in 1959 as co-discoverer of the antiproton,
died of a heart attack while walking near his home, it was
announced Sunday. He was 84.
   Segre died Saturday near his home in Lafayette, about 25 miles
east of San Francisco, officials at the University of California at
Berkeley said.
   ``Professor Segre was a scientist of great integity, dedication
and conscience,'' UC Berkeley Chancellor Ira Heyman said Sunday.
``His discoveries will forever rank among the great contributions
in physics, and his life will be a model for the best in science.''
   Segre, a faculty member at UC Berkeley for almost 50 years and a
scientist at the university's Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, with
fellow Berkeley physics professor Owen Chamberlain accepted the
Nobel Prize in 1959, along with co-authors Clyde Wiegand and Thomas
Ypsilantis.
   He gained attention in the 1930s for discovering technetium
(element 43), the first artificially produced element, and astatine
(element 85).
   A pioneer in chemical separation of nuclear isomers, Segre also
was the first to observe the ``Zeeman effect'' in so-called
``forbidden spectra.'' The ``Zeeman effect'' is the splitting of a
spectral line when a light source is put in a magnetic field and
indicates the atoms' changed energy levels.
   Segre became the first student to earn a doctoral degree in
physics under professor Enrico Fermi's sponsorship at the
University of Rome in 1928.
   He was director of the physics laboratory at the University of
Palermo from 1936 to 1938, but he and his first wife were of Jewish
descent and Mussolini's racial decrees made it impossible for them
to remain in Italy after 1938.
   They came to the United States, where Segre worked with Ernest
O. Lawrence and others with cyclotrons that Lawrence invented. He
became a group leader at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico,
became a U.S. citizn 1944 and accepted a professorship at UC
Berkeley's physics department in 1946.
   Segre once recalled his research with Chamberlain as they hunted
for the antiproton that was predicted in earlier physics theory.
They designed a maze through which only antiprotons could pass, and
initially detected just 60 antiprotons.
   ``We had to sort them out and weigh them within much less than a
millionth of a second,'' he said. ``If we had wanted to have them
for a longer time, we would have had to dig a tunnel in the
Berkeley hills to run after them.''
   The antiproton is the opposite counterpart to the positively
charged proton. It contains a negative electrical charge and
opposite magnetic properties to the proton, but has the same mass.
   Although Segre retired to emeritus status in 1972, he stayed
active in research, lecturing and writing. Friends said that in
recent weeks he had inquired about the possible ``cold fusion''
discoveries in Utah.
   Segre was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, was
decorated with the Great Cross of Merit of the Republic of Italy
and was given appointment as physics professor at the University of
Rome in 1974.
   He is survived by his wife, Rosa Mines; a son, Claudio, a
history professor at the University of Texas at Austin; daughters
Amelia Terkel of Tel Aviv, and Fausta Walsby of England; and five
grandchildren.
