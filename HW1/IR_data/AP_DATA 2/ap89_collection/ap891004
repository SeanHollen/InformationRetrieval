   The captain of the USS Iowa and three
subordinates were charged with dereliction of duty for violating
administrative procedures aboard the battleship on which 47 men
were killed in an explosion, the Navy said Wednesday.
   The actions against the four men, ranging from ``administrative
corrective measures to punitive letters of admonition,'' resulted
from admiral's mast hearings conducted earlier this week on board
the Iowa in the Mediterranean by Vice Adm. Joseph S. Donnell III.
   None of the men was relieved of his duties.
   ``Each person was charged with a dereliction of duty under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice as a result of administrative
deficiencies found in the USS Iowa investigation,'' the Navy said.
   Despite violations of procedure, the Navy said, ``None of the
discrepancies resulted in or contributed to the explosion'' on
April 19.
   A Navy investigation concluded that gunner's mate Clayton
Hartwig ``most likely'' caused the explosion in the battleship's
No. 2 gun turret by inserting a detonator between two powder bags.
   The report, which has come under congressional scrutiny, turned
up numerous lax procedures, including experimentation with
extra-strength gunpower and projectile loads, the Navy said. Those
allegations prompted the admiral's mast hearings.
   As a result of the hearings, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, commander
of the battleship and the only man publicly identified by the
service, and his operations officer, Cmdr. Robert Finney, were
subject to ``administrative corrective measures,'' the Navy said.
Navy sources identified Finney and the other two men cited in
hearings.
   A Navy source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Moosally
and Finney will not have letters that affect their potential
promotions placed in their files, although they will be given the
letters.
   However, the source said their annual fitness reports will
reflect the problems on the Iowa and their careers are likely to be
damaged.
   Stiffer disciplinary action was given to the weapons officer and
the fire control gunner, who were given punitive letters of
admonition. The weapons officer was fined $2,000 and the gunner
$1,000, but the fines were forgiven.
   The weapons control officer has been identified as Cmdr. Robert
J. Kissinger, while the gunner was Master Chief Petty Officer
Stephen Skelly.
   The service said the action against Moosally was less severe
because ``subordinates were held accountable for deficiencies in
their specifically assigned duties.''
   Kathy Kubicina of Cleveland, Hartwig's sister, said she was not
surprised by the Navy action.
   ``They got merely a slap on the wrists. If they would have
gotten something harsher, the Navy would have had to admit their
own guilt. I was prepared for this, which is absolutely nothing,''
she said.
   Donnell based his punishment on what he concluded was
appropriate for each person, the Navy said, insisting that the
administrative deficiencies had nothing to do with the explosion.
   ``It should be stressed that although deficiencies in the Iowa's
training documentation, weapons handling requirements and adherence
to safety procedures were found within the weapons department, the
investigation determined that these shortcomings did not cause or
contribute to the explosion,'' the Navy said in a statement.
   In deciding on the punishments, Donnell was ``required to
separate the larger tragedy from the process of determining
accountability for administrative training, safety and
ordnance-handling deficiencies,'' the Navy said.
   All four men can appeal for a review of the actions.

   Authorities seized almost 18,000 pounds
of cocaine Wednesday in what could be the second-largest amount in
U.S. history and arrested five people, officials said.
   ``We think it's the second-largest cocaine seizure in the U.S.,
second only to the 40,000 pounds seized last week in (Los
Angeles),'' said Mike Cox, a spokesman for the state Department of
Public Safety in Austin.
   The 17,950 pounds of cocaine _ nearly nine tons _ were seized
and the five were arrested fat a rural residence just west of
Harlingen, said DPS Sgt. Tony Garcia.
   Seven men were arrested last week in Los Angeles and Las Vegas
after a record 20-ton cocaine seizure connected to the Mexican leg
of a major smuggling operation that brought the drug from Colombia.
   Federal investigators have linked a warehouse in El Paso and
three homes across the border in Ciudad Juarez to the Los Angeles
cocaine stash. Drug agents said the cocaine apparently came into
the country via El Paso and was then shipped to Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
   Health officials are blaming contaminated food for
an outbreak of salmonella poisoning that killed seven residents of
a geriatric hospital and sickened 160 others.
   The preliminary findings released Wednesday by France's public
hospital authority indicated food preparation at the Charles Richet
hospital in suburban Cergy Pontoise was not the cause of the
outbreak.
   Salmonella poisoning struck nearly one quarter of the hospital's
670 patients shortly after a Sept. 28 dinner of a soup including
ground beef, followed by an omelette, with rice pudding for dessert.
   Since Friday, two women and five men aged 85 to 93 have died
from food poisoning. The remaining 160 infected patients are not in
life-threatening danger, the health authority said in a statement.
   Residents at the hospital are long-term patients suffering
serious illness or handicaps, the health authority said.
   An investigation conducted by the Pasteur Institute will attempt
to pinpoint the exact cause of the poisoning, the health authority
said. The results will not be known for several days.
   The mass poisoning is the second in France in three months. Nine
patients at a retirement home at La Rochelle in western France died
over a one-month period after eating salmonella-infected rice
pudding July 9.
   There were 6,000 reported cases of salmonella poisoning in
France during 1988, health officials said.

   A rare pottery character jug modeled
after Winston Churchill, which the World War II leader disliked so
much that production was stopped, sold for $26,400 at auction,
Sotheby's says.
   London dealer Tom Power bought the 7{-inch tall jug of
Churchill's head against competing bids from the United States and
Canada telephoned to the sale room this northwestern town.
   Christopher Proudlove, the auction house spokesman, said only
three of the jugs are known to exist.
   ``Royal Doulton made a few in 1940 before production was stopped
when Churchill said he didn't like the way his features were
portrayed. The jugs were meant as a tribute to his leadership
during the Battle of Britain but none was sold,'' he said.
   The sellers were an unidentified English couple who did not say

   One of two men who bombed three abortion
facilities here on Christmas Day 1984 is free and the other is
scheduled to be paroled next month, federal officials said
Wednesday.
   James Simmons and Matthew Goldsby, both 26 and from the
Cantonment community north of Pensacola, have served about half of
the 10-year prison sentences they received for the Christmas Day
bombings.
   The bombings in this Florida Panhandle city, followed by three
more in the Washington, D.C., area the next week, refocused
national attention on the abortion issue.
   Simmons was transferred from the Tallahassee Federal
Correctional Institution to a work-release program in Pensacola a
couple months ago.
   He was released from there 59 days early on Sept. 25 under the
federal curfew parole program, said Tom Kowalski, regional
administrator for the U.S. Parole Commission in Atlanta.
   Although free, he must observe a curfew until his regular parole
date of Nov. 28, Kowalski said.
   Goldsby is scheduled for release Nov. 21. His initial release
date was May 21, 1990, but George Rast, the regional parole
commissioner, moved it up two years ago because Goldsby was
credited with superior program achievement, which could include
good conduct, work performance and educational advancement.
   Simmons, a glass company employee, and Goldsby, a construction
worker, were convicted of planting homemade pipe bombs at a clinic
and two doctors' offices where abortions were performed. The
building in which one office was located was demolished by the
explosion and ensuing fire and the other office was seriously
damaged.
   Damage at the clinic, The Ladies Center, was less severe and it
soon reopened, becoming the target of numerous anti-abortion
demonstrations.
   One doctor at the bombed-out clinic retired and the other
discontinued abortions because insurance companies refused to cover
his new office, fearing it also might be attacked as long as he
continued that part of his practice.
   Simmons' wife, Kathren, and Goldsby's former fiance, Kay
Wiggins, were convicted on conspiracy charges and placed on
probation.
   All four had attended the First Assembly of God Church in
Pensacola and said the two men were driven by religious conviction.
   Feminist leaders criticized the sentences are being too lenient
to begin with. The terms were the shortest given to people
convicted of bombing or torching abortion clinics up to that time.
   The case drew wide public attention when it went to trial in
April 1985 with defense lawyers portraying their clients as
idealistic ``knights in shining armor'' or ``Tom Sawyer and Huck
Finn.''

   President Bush's approval rating remains high,
although a majority feel his administration is lagging in the war
on drugs, the budget deficit and pollution, according to a
Washington Post-ABC News poll.
   Bush's approval rating as president stood at 76 percent among
the 1,535 adults interviewed at random for the survey, which was
conducted between Sept. 28 and Oct. 3 and reported on in Thursday
editions of the newspaper.
   Other recent polls have show similar high approval ratings for
Bush.
   In the war on drugs, 56 percent said the administration is not
doing all it can, 68 percent held a similar view on the budget
deficit and 71 percent said not enough was being done to combat
pollution.
   However, 61 percent approved of the way Bush is dealing with the
nation's environmental problems and 72 percent approved of his
handling of foreign affairs.
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage
points.

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of ethnic Turks line up daily
at the Turkish Embassy in Sofia, besieging officials for visas to
enter Turkey. But about 20,000 who got visas in past months have
come back, unable to find good jobs or housing in Turkey.
   The Turks have been fleeing a sometimes-violent campaign by
Bulgarian authorities, going back to 1984, to force them to use
Bulgarian names, curtail their Moslem religious rites and stop
speaking Turkish in public.
   Diplomats in Sofia say many of the Turks who have returned face
prosecution, although they have no details of such cases. They also
say the Turks often are forbidden to return to their previous jobs
and homes, partly due to an acute labor shortage in some areas that
has prompted authorities to shift manual labor to crucial
construction projects and industries.
   The official Bulgarian news agency, BTA, has reported the return
rate at 500 to 1,000 a day.
   A Turkish diplomat in Sofia said, however, that ethnic Turks
``still want to leave Bulgaria as vigorously as before.''
   ``You can see for yourself. There are some 2,000 people waiting
around our consulate every day,'' he said.
   About 320,000 of Bulgaria's 1.5 million ethnic Turks began in
mid-year to leave for Turkey. Bulgaria deported some of them.
Others emigrated under new liberalized passport regulations. Many
had their possessions seized before leaving, and their arrival
strained Turkish abilities to absorb them.
   On Aug. 22, Premier Turgut Ozal of Turkey closed the border to
the ethnic Turks, requiring them to obtain regular visas. His move,
part of an attempt to persuade Bulgaria to safeguard the property
of those seeking to settle in Turkey, was widely seen as a
diplomatic victory for Bulgaria's Communist government over Turkey,
which had asserted at one point that it would welcome any Bulgarian
Turk facing persecution.
   Now that Turkey is no longer absorbing large new groups of
ethnic Turks, the situation of people wanting to emigrate has
become even more precarious. About 25,000 would-be emigrants are
stranded in Bulgaria. Most have sold their houses and other
belongings.
   A Turkish diplomat said his mission now is to issue visas only
for family reunification and other urgent case.
   ``In all, we are interviewing about 800 people a day,'' he said.
Only a handful, perhaps a dozen or so, receive visas each day.
   ``With the numbers we have given out for visa applicants, we are
already in the mid-1990s,'' he said of a waiting list for
interviews.
   Long lines reportedly also have formed outside the Turkish
consulates in Varna on the Black Sea and the southern industrial
town of Plovdiv.
   Several diplomats in Sofia asserted that 500,000 more ethnic
Turks may want to emigrate to Turkey.
   But Bulgaria continues to balk at a new emigration accord with
Turkey that would set out in detail such things as property rights
and social security claims.
   ``Such a new immigration agreement would limit the free movement
of our people under the Helsinki accords'' on human rights, said
Chavdar Mladenov of the Foreign Ministry. Bulgaria has come under
heavy Western criticism over the issue.
   Officially, Bulgaria has stopped referring to a Turkish minority
in the country. Officials and newspapers now invariably speak of
``Bulgarian Moslems.''
   Maldenov asserted flatly that there are no Turks in Bulgaria.
   Turks indeed have left some of the villages in the Razgrad area,
270 miles northeast of Sofia.
   ``Of 400 families, 300 left'' for Turkey, said one of the
handful of farmers in one village.
   In Mortagonovo, another predominantly Turkish village, a frail
man in his late 70s sat on a bench, his prayer beads gliding
through his fingers.
   He was asked if he planned to leave.
   ``I was waiting in a camp down south for 15 days. Then they
closed the border,'' he said in halting Bulgarian. ``I sold my
house before I left. Now I'm staying with my son.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was asked over
lunch with foreign journalists how she'd run a political campaign
against Margaret Thatcher.
   Her reply:
   ``I wouldn't. I'd vote for her.''
   This instant response on Wednesday showed the British prime
minister in full, combative cry as she goes into the 1989-90
political season, with three consecutive election victories behind
her and every indication she will go for a fourth.
   Autumn in Britain means the annual party conventions, where
political leaders take stock of the year and promise victory next
time.
   Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives convene next week. The opposition
Labor Party is halfway through its convention, buoyed by opinion
poll leads and a conviction that after a decade of Thatcherism, the
British are ready for a change.
   Mrs. Thatcher obviously disagrees, but she does so with the zeal
and enthusiasm of a first-time candidate rather than a senior
stateswoman who turns 64 this month and is the longest-serving
leader of a Western democracy.
   She has been to Poland and talked to farmers who can't get
permits for equipment to grow crops. Last month she was in Siberia,
watching Soviets selling vodka to her press party, strictly for
hard currency. She had her sixth meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and was struck once again, she says, by the enormous risks of
switching rapidly from communism to a free market.
   Her conclusion is characteristically simple: ``There is no
revision, refashioning or reform of socialism that is possible.
There's only rejection of it.''
   This unwavering conviction that she is right is a Thatcher
hallmark, and any suggestion of second thoughts is quickly slapped
down.
   Lately, attempts are being made to penetrate the Thatcher
mystique through long-distance psychoanalysis. Leo Abse, a former
Labor lawmaker, has just published a 288-page book whose central
thesis is that Mrs. Thatcher suffers from narcissism caused by an
unloving mother.
   On Wednesday, The Independent newspaper said Mrs. Thatcher plans
to block her official residence with 10-foot-high railings. It said
psychiatrists believed it was a sign of the stress caused by 10
years at the helm.
   Mrs. Thatcher probably would scoff at such notions. She believes
she simply represents basic human instincts.
   ``Thatcherism is a lot older than me,'' she said.
   Referring to Britain's bumpy passage into the brotherhood of
European nations, she said she merely wanted to make sure the
European Economic Community followed Thatcherite principles, namely
not to tie free enterprise down in bureaucracy.
   ``Because we approached the whole of Europe in the same way as
we do at home, we don't wish it to be tied up with unnecessary
regulations,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher likes to illustrate her points with mundane
examples, like the Polish farmers last year. She had asked them why
they couldn't grow enough food. They told her it was because of the
difficulty in obtaining farming equipment from officials.
   ``And then it suddenly dawned on me,'' Mrs. Thatcher said,
``that it is the whole network of intricate controls which will
stop people from being able to make maximum use of their property.''

<TEXT>
   A B-1B bomber with
crippled landing gear flew halfway across the continent Wednesday
and made a successful touchdown on the Mojave Desert lake bed where
the space shuttle lands.
   The $280 million aircraft, with its four-member crew unable to
unlock its nose landing gear, refueled in the air and landed at
6:15 p.m. after 11{ hours in the air that began as a training
flight in Texas.
   The big bomber trailed a plume of dust as it rolled down the
12-mile-long runway after touchdown, slowly lowering onto its nose.
   ``There were no injuries,'' said Tech. Sgt. Donn Clarius, a
spokesman at Edwards Air Force Base. ``The flight crew came out
just fine.
   ``There was no fire or explosion or anything.''
   He said the bomber suffered some damage, which was being
assessed by ground crews as darkness fell.
   Dale Punter, an aerospace buff who monitors military frequencies
from his home in Lancaster, listened to radio traffic between the
pilots and controllers.
   Just before touching down the pilot said, ``It's been a great
day for flying, except for a few glitches,'' Punter reported.
   Just after the landing, Punter said he heard the pilot say, ``It
was real nice. Structure looking good.''
   During the landing, the massive bomber skidded on its nose for
more than half a minute, yet it did not break up. No flames were
seen.
   ``It's one of the safest areas to land,'' said base spokeswoman
Dottie Spiegelberg, adding that the hard clay surface means there
are no sparks and minimizes the chance of explosion or fire.
   The aircraft, flying out of Dyess Air Force Base in Texas,
wasn't carrying bombs. ``There are no nuclear weapons,'' said Lt.
Anu Sjaardema, an Edwards public affairs spokeswoman.
   An 18-unit disaster preparedness team was mobilized at Edwards,
including explosives experts, a mortuary services officer, an
environmental officer and fire department personnel, the lieutenant
said.
   ``They route a lot of emergencies to our lake bed, both military
and civilian. We have a team to respond to that all the time,''
said Sjaardema.
   The flight crew was Capt. Jeffrey K. Beene, 30, aircraft
commander, of the 337th Bombardment Squadron at Dyess; Capt. Vernon
B. Benton, 30, co-pilot; Capt. Robert H. Hendricks, 31, offensive
systems officer and Lt. Col. Joseph G. Day, 38, an instructor and
offensive systems officer with the 338th Combat Crew Training
Squadron.
   The crippled plane was refueled by a tanker plane before flying
to Edwards, about 1,200 miles away.
   The B-1B, with a maximum speed of 1,000 mph and range of more
than 7,000 miles, is 147 feet long and 137 feet wide when its
swing-wings are extended. It weighs 477,000 pounds when fully
fueled and armed.
   Maj. Mary Beth Kilgore at Dyess said the plane started circling
Dyess at about 9:30 a.m. PDT. It left for California five hours
later.
   Mechanics from Dyess and the plane's manufacturer, Rockwell
International, worked with the plane's crew to try get the nose
gear down. The plane's rear wheels were down while it circled
Dyess, located at the western edge of Abilene, a city of 100,000 in
west Texas.
   The plane took off from Dyess at 6:38 a.m. PDT on a training
mission.
   The plane was originally tested at Edwards AFB and Ms. Kilgore
said Dyess officials believed someone there could figure out the
problem.
   Dyess is one of four bases in the United States where B-1
bombers are stationed.
   In March 1986, the variable-sweep wings became stuck on the
second production model of the B-1B during a training flight out of
Dyess AFB. The pilots successfully made a high-speed landing at
Edwards when the wings were swept back. The plane stopped after
using 13,000 feet of runway.
   There have been three B-1B crashes and the crash of a B-1
prototype. The most recent crash was in November 1988 at Ellsworth
Air Force Base in South Dakota. All four crew members ejected
safely.
   The three crashes left the Air Force with 97 of the B1-B planes,
the first bomber added to Strategic Air Command in about 25 years.
Production has been completed, for $20.5 billion. The plane was
killed by President Carter in 1977 and resurrected by President
Reagan in 1981.
   In February, the GAO said problems persist in performance of the
plane _ range and payload _ and fuel leaks probably could not be
corrected. Fixes could cost $400 million per aircraft if the Air
Force decided to do them all, the GAO said.

   The Bogota newspaper that was bombed bcause of
its coverage of Colombia's drug trade is now losing money and may
have to close, its president is quoted as saying.
   A car bomb that exploded near the offices of El Espectador on
Sept. 2 did $2.5 million worth of damage, according to the
president, Luis Cano, in remarks at a luncheon with editors and
reporters of The Washington Post on Wednesday.
   A report on the luncheon appeared in Thursday editions of the

   Advertisers have been threatened, and some smaller ones have
left the newspaper, Cano said. But among employees, ``no one
abandoned the paper,'' he said.
   ``If we don't receive some support, we cannot continue,'' Cano
was quoted as saying.
   Cano said his company, which employs about 1,000 people and
publishes the second-largest daily in Colombia with a circulation
of 200,000, is seeking a long-term, low-interest loan from
Colombia's central bank.
   He is touring the United States, in part to seek support from
news organizations.

   Del Wood, The Grand Ole Opry's ragtime
pianist whose 1951 recording of ``Down Yonder'' sold more than 3
million copies, died Tuesday at a Nashville hospital following a
stroke. She was 69.
   Miss Wood became a member of the Opry in 1953 and was the only
person regularly featured at the Grand Ole Opry keyboard.
   Minnie Pearl is the only woman who has been on the famous
country music show longer than Miss Wood, said Opry spokesman
Gerald Strobel.
   Miss Wood suffered a stroke last week and was in intensive care
at Baptist Hospital until her death Tuesday night, said Pat Harris,
a family friend.
   Known as ``The Queen of the Ivories,'' her real name was
Adelaide Hazelwood. In an interview with the Associated Press in
1984, she said she still practiced about three hours a week.
   ``I'd never go on the Opry without first doing a run-through. If
I live to be 100, I'm going to do the best I can,'' she said.
   Grand Ole Opry star Roy Acuff said Miss Wood was a fine pianist.
   ``I don't know of any we've had on the Opry better on the piano
than she was. She made a very fine reputation for herself in
country music,'' he said.
   Miss Wood's parents gave her a piano on her fifth birthday and
she was schooled in classical music until ragtime _ a
jazz-influenced style of pop music _ became her passion as a
teen-ager.
   ``Ragtime has so much get-up-and-go that it's infectious; it's
part of our heritage,'' she said.
   After graduating from high school in Nashville, she worked
playing sheet music for customers at a dime store and as a payroll
clerk for the state Health Department while pursuing her music
career on weekends and at night.
   She cut a record featuring ``Mine All Mine,'' for RCA and with
``Down Yonder'' on the flip side. ``Down Yonder'' was second on the
pop charts for 27 weeks and was also a country hit.
   Miss Wood also played five songs in the movie ``Rhinestone,''
which starred Dolly Parton and Sylvester Stallone.

   The annual Top Performance awards of the
Associated Press Managing Editors association have been presented
to the AP's Beijing bureau, National Writer Fred Bayles, Science
Writer Daniel Q. Haney and AP photographers Jeff Widener of
Bangkok, Liu Heung Shing of Seoul and Scott Applewhite of
Washington.
   The organization also named Boston newswoman Leslie Dreyfous
winner of the ninth annual John L. Dougherty award for excellence
by a young AP writer.
   The Top Performance awards recognize outstanding work by AP
reporters and photographers in the previous 12 months in two
reporting categories _ writing on deadline and feature writing _
and two photography categories _ spot news and feature photography.
   The winners were awarded $1,500 and a plaque at the APME
convention here Tuesday.
   The AP Beijing bureau was honored for coverage of the
suppression of the student-led democracy movement in China. Those
specifically cited were Jim Abrams, Kathy Wilhelm and John Pomfret
of Beijing, Terril Jones of Tokyo and Dan Biers of Hong Kong. Jones
and Biers were on assignment in Beijing.
   Bayles and Haney, both of the AP's Boston bureau, were chosen
for a three-part series, ``Six Miles Up and Sleepy,'' about the
risks caused by fatigue among airline pilots.
   Widener and Liu were selected co-winners for their photo
coverage of the student demonstrations and subsequent government
crackdown in Beijing. Applewhite was singled out for a photo of
President Bush and Lee Atwater, the Republican National Committee
chairman, mugging while accompanying a band during the presidential
inauguration.
   The John L. Dougherty award is named for a former APME leader
and managing editor of the Rochester, N.Y., newspapers who had an
abiding interest in good writing and helped young writers improve
their skills. He died in 1980. Ms. Dreyfous received a $1,000 cash
award and a plaque.
   Additional awards for excellence in the Top Performance
reporting competition went to:
   _ Maureen Johnson of London, and Earleen Fisher and Sharon
Herbaugh, both of New Delhi, for coverage of the Soviet troop
withdrawal from Afghanistan and its aftermath;
   _ John-Thor Dahlburg, Andrew Katell, Mark Porubcansky, all of
Moscow, Sydney Rubin of Paris, and Carol J. Williams of Bonn, for
coverage of the catastrophic earthquake in Soviet Armenia;
   _ Nancy Shulins, AP Newsfeatures, for her story ``Lost
Innocence,'' about two elderly Vermont brothers whose peaceful
lives were shattered by a violent robbery;
   _ AP Latin America staff members Kevin Noblet, Monte Hayes, Todd
Lewan, Peter McFarren, Susana Hayward, Harold Olmos, Eduardo
Gallardo, Bruce Handler and Ed McCullough, and Lisa Genasci of the
New York Foreign Desk, for their periodic series, ``Continent in
Crisis,'' about the economic, political and social turbulence in
Latin America;
   _ David Foster, Scott McCartney and Tad Bartimus, all AP
regional reporters, and Hal Spencer of Olympia, Wash., for ``Course
of Doom,'' an examination of the years of errors that made the
Exxon Valdez oil-spill disaster inevitable.
   Awards for excellence in photography were given to:
   _ Boris Yurchenko of Moscow for his work in the aftermath of the
Armenian earthquake and for a photo of Mikhail Gorbachev checking
his watch while Margaret Thatcher spoke in London in April;
   _ Katsumi Kashahara of Tokyo for a picture of Greg Louganis
hitting his head on the diving board at the Seoul Olympics;
   _ Jack Smith of Portland, Ore., for a closeup of an oil-covered
bird after the Alaska spill and for a photo of native Alaskans
tending to a gray whale trapped in the ice;
   _ Amy Sancetta of Philadelphia for her photo series documenting
the progress of a young Armenian boy undergoing surgery and therapy
for injuries incurred in the Armenian earthquake.

<HEAD>Despite Difficulties, Pope Strives for Better Relations with Moslems</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<HEAD>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With his travels to Africa and Asia, his
peace initiatives and calls to forget the painful past, Pope John
Paul II has made unprecedented openings to the Moslem world.
   But the road to dialogue is dotted with obstacles, and the
Vatican is keeping a wary eye on challenges to the church in
Islamic countries.
   Over the past two decades, and especially during John Paul's
11-year pontificate, the Roman Catholic Church has sought to erase
the image of medieval crusades fought in the name of faith.
   ``Moslems and Christians have generally understood each other
badly and sometimes, in the past, have exhausted each other in
polemics and wars,'' he said in Morocco four years ago as the first
pontiff to set foot on Arab soil as an official state guest.
   He said dialogue was essential between the Catholic church and
Islam, the two largest religious groups in the world.
   But the spread of Moslem fundamentalism has raised alarm,
especially for isolated minority communities of Christians. The
danger of Moslem-Christian rivalries has been dramatized by the
bloodshed in Lebanon.
   The pope's concern over the Lebanon fighting recently led him to
make the first direct appeal by a pontiff to the Islamic world,
saying there can be no winners in such a struggle.
   He also repeated his desire to visit the country torn by 14
years of civil war, despite threats against him from Moslem
extremists.
   On Oct. 9, John Paul begins a visit to Indonesia, the world's
largest Moslem country with an estimated 140 million Moslems and a
tiny Roman Catholic minority of 5 million. He will be there until
Oct. 14.
   The pope has previously stopped in such predominantly Islamic
countries as Turkey and Bangladesh as well as several African
countries with large Moslem populations.
   The era of dialogue was spurred by the Second Vatican Council,
which also opened the way to improved relations between Catholics
and Jews.
   ``Upon the Moslems, too, the church looks with esteem,'' said
the 1965 declaration Nostra Aetate. ``They adore one God, living
and enduring, merciful, and all powerful, maker of heaven and earth
and speaker to men.''
   Vatican officials are pleased that its efforts have led to
stepped-up exchanges of visits between church representatives and
Moslem theologians.
   The Vatican also maintains diplomatic relations with a number of
predominantly Islamic countries, including Egypt, Iraq, Syria,
Iran, Turkey and Indonesia.
   John Paul's calls for a homeland for the Palestinians have won
him appreciation in the Moslem world while his meetings with PLO
leader Yasser Arafat drew protests from Israel, a country with
which the Vatican has refused to establish formal diplomatic
relations.
   The church has generally been cautious to avoid offending Moslem
sensibilities. Officials note that on Islamic issues, it often has
to deal with governments, not religious leaders.
   ``It's something like the church in Eastern Europe, where
diplomacy is the best method. We like to do things quietly,'' said
a Vatican official speaking on the usual rule of anonymity.
   During the height of the fury earlier this year over Salman
Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' the Vatican's newspaper
said millions of Moslems had found the novel offensive. It
condemned ``whatever is irreverent and blasphemous'' in the book
but said the author should not be killed, as the late Iranian
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, demanded.
   According to church surveys, the amount of religious liberty and
pluralism varies considerably in the Moslem world.
   In some cases, the Catholic minorities ``live in a state of
tension and of concern at the possibility of new restrictions,''
said Fides, a press service at the Vatican's missionary office.
   The Vatican is worried about the spread of Moslem fundamentalism
in countries such as Sudan ad in Nigeria, where rivalries between
Christians and Moslems led to the burning of churches and mosques
in the northern part of the country in 1987.
   In an unusual public criticism, the Vatican in a major document
on racism issued in February condemned the imposition of the
Sharia, or Islamic law, on non-Moslems.
   Catholicism's fastest growing church is in Africa, but it is
subject to special pressures.
   During a visit to Rwanda in 1982, Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi declared ``Africa is not Christian'' and called for a holy
war to help spread Islam on the continent.
   Vatican officials consider Indonesia a generally tolerant
country, but Indonesian Catholics say they are worried about a
government bill presented to Parliament that would give legal
recognition to several hundred Islamic courts.
   Religion and politics are also intertwined on East Timor, a
former Portuguese colony with a large Catholic population forcibly
annexed by Indonesia in 1976. Church officials report that a number
of Moslems have been converting to Catholicism as a political
statement of their opposition to Indonesian rule.

   Mikhail Baryshnikov gave an exciting performance
in ``American Document'' at the opening night gala of the Martha
Graham Dance Company.
   Baryshnikov danced as though born to the Graham technique,
although his training is in ballet, which is much different.
   Cecilia Peck, a student at the Graham school and daughter of
actor Gregory Peck, narrated the dance, a celebration of democracy
which Miss Graham choreographed originally in 1938 and revised this
year.
   The 95-year-old choreographer took bows with the company after
the performance Tuesday night at the City Center, and the audience
responded with a standing ovation.
   Baryshnikov and Maxine Sherman danced the roles of an
``everyman'' couple who move through the history of America. Both
were modest but eager, stalwart and optimistic. Their duets _ from
embattled through proud to beautifully romantic _ were a high point
of ``American Document.''
   In the original production, the parts were danced by Miss Graham
and Erich Hawkins.
   Joyce Herring, in red, danced the counterpart to the narrator.
In revising the dance, Miss Graham changed the chorus from the
original all women to nine women and eight men. She also integrated
the speaking and dancing more smoothly and she changed the music
``American Document'' is danced to from a score by Ray Green to
``Concerto for Oboe and Orchestra'' by John Corigliano.
   Bert Lucarelli was oboe soloist and Stanley Sussman conducted.
   The evening began with ``Night Chant'' from 1988 and ended with
``The Rite of Spring'' from 1984, both choreographed by Miss Graham.
   The company will dance at the City Center through Oct. 22.

<HEAD>`Last Temptation' Controversial for Cable Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The uproar that surrounded ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' at
the box office was renewed when it hit cable television this week,
with some groups vowing to cancel subscriptions and others
protesting local blackouts of the film.
   Several cable companies around the country refused to show the
movie, transmitted on the Cinemax pay cable network, prompting
outcries of censorship, while others broadcast disclaimers
beforehand.
   The movie portrays the life of Jesus Christ and includes scenes
of a fantasy Jesus entertains in the movie about being married to
Mary Magdalen.
   Its box-office opening last year was followed by protests
nationwide, with some theaters canceling showings because of bomb
threats.
   In West Memphis, Ark., about 300 members of eight churches vowed
to cancel their cable television subscriptions for six months after
the movie was shown Monday night on Cinemax.
   ``We know there are many other forms of what we would call
sinful viewing, but we feel the line must be drawn somewhere,''
said the Rev. Gary Hair, pastor of Calvary Baptist Church. ``We
know that people are free to watch what they want, and by the same
token we're free to make an appeal. We believe the message of
Christ is being blasphemed.''
   Cable companies across the country, including at least three in
Arkansas and two in Pennsylvania, were blacking out the movie to
their subscribers, but the manager of American Cablevision in West
Memphis said he refused to.
   ``One, we believe we're not allowed to censor the programming
under our contract with Cinemax; and, two, a basic First Amendment
reason _ we might not agree with what the movie has to say, but
we're not going to censor it because one element of the community
asks us to.''
   Officials Home Box Office, the parent company of Cinemax, said
they would have no comment on the controversy.
   Some of the protests were against the cable companies' decision
not to show the movie.
   In Jonesboro, Ark., more than 30 people carried signs that
``Stand Up Against Censorship'' as they marched outside East
Arkansas Cablevision. man confused over his identity and purpose,
and subject to sexual temptation.
   In Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Service Electric displayed a message on a
blue screen: ``The management of Service Electric have decided not
carry this film because of strong content objections voiced by
various groups when the movie was initially released to theaters.
We do not believe it is responsible to offer a movie, even on a
paid channel, which was not generally shown in general theaters
because of sensitive content.''
   ``I went to Vietnam to fight against this kind of thing,'' said
Richard Tattersall of Wilkes-Barre. ``I came home and was taking my
boots off to go to bed when I switched on the TV. I don't even want
to watch the thing; I'm just angry they're censoring it.''
   A 73-year-old Oklahoma man has sued Multimedia Cablevision for
$1 million for allegedly violating his constitutional rights by
pre-empting the movie.
   ``I'm a World War II veteran, and I treasure our Constitution
and all the provisions of it, and I say if we don't protect it then
we deserve to lose it,'' Felix Olim said.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Horace G. Alexander, a Quaker who served as
an intermediary between Mahatma Gandhi and the British government
during India's struggle for freedom, has died. He was 100.
   Alexander died of natural causes Saturday at Crosslands
Retirement Community in Kennett Square, a suburb of Philadelphia,
said his stepdaughter, Cecilia Bradbeer Sibinga.
   Gandhi once described Alexander as ``British in nationality but
Indian in heart.'' Alexander was with Gandhi in Calcutta Aug. 15,
1947, when India gained its freedom from the United Kingdom.
   In 1984, India honored Alexander for his contribution by
awarding him one of the country's highest decorations, the Padma
Bhushan Award, roughly translated as ``outstanding human being.''
   Two years after his first wife, Olive Garaham, died in 1943,
Alexander made his first visit to the United States. He moved to
Swarthmore with his second wife, Rebecca Biddle Bradbeer, in 1969.
   In a 1984 interview, Alexander said he continued to believe in
the non-violent principles of Gandhi.
   ``I try to be hopeful about the future, but it is rather
difficult, isn't it? But there are a lot of people in the world who
are trying to take non-violence seriously, so maybe in the course
of time, it will begin to affect national policy,'' he said.
   ``People have a great capacity for good things as well as evil
things, and I suppose each of us has to go on doing the little bit
he can.''
   In addition to his stepdaughter and second wife, Alexander is
survived by a son, James Biddle Bradbeer.

<HEAD>Different Cast, But `Different World' Premieres in Top 10</HEAD>

   Television viewers were indifferent to cast
changes in ``A Different World'' as the NBC comedy series without
Cosby kid Lisa Bonet placed fourth in the latest A.C. Nielsen Co.
ratings.
   ABC's ``Roseanne,'' elbowed aside the previous week by the
season premiere of ``The Cosby Show,'' regained first place and
``Cosby,'' with Miss Bonet back in the family fold, went to No. 2.
   ``Cheers'' was rated third, followed by the season premiere of
``A Different World'' and ``The Golden Girls,'' all on NBC. CBS'
``Murder, She Wrote''' was in sixth place, followed by the season
premiere of NBC's ``Empty Nest.''
   A preview showing of ABC's ``Living Dolls'' on Tuesday night
earned eighth place in the ratings.
   ``Dear John'' on NBC was No. 9, and the season premiere of CBS'
``60 Minutes'' was in 10th place.
   NBC remained the top network for the 67th week in a row. Its
average prime-time rating last week was 14.6 with a 25 average
share. ABC's averages were a 13.4 rating and 23 share and CBS 12.9
and 22.
   The ratings are the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million
homes with television sets in the United States. The share is the
percentage of the sets in use.
   The share for all three networks last week was 69.4, down from
the previous week's 72.
   In Sunday night movie competition, ``The CBS Sunday Movie''
narrowly beat ``Night Walk,'' a mystery starring Robert Urich and
Lesley-Anne Down. The show had a 16.3 rating and 27 share for 21st
place.
   In 22nd place was ``The ABC Sunday Night Movie,'' ``Indiana
Jones and the Temple of Doom.'' Long available on videocassette,
the broadcast of the film nonetheless drew a 16.1 rating and a 27
share.
   But ``Sweet Bird of Youth,'' a broadcast version of the
Tennessee Williams play starring Elizabeth Taylor and Mark Harmon
came in at No. 40 for the ``NBC Sunday Night Movie.'' The
television movie had a 13 rating and a 21 share.
   Comic Jackie Mason's ``Chicken Soup'' on ABC went from No. 14 to
11th place in the ratings, while another ABC show, ``Doogie Howser,
M.D.,'' went up six notches from 33rd to 27th place in its regular
time slot.
   The highest rated Fox Broadcasting Co. show was ``Married...With
Children,' in 50th place.
   In the news category, ``The CBS Evening News'' took first place
with a weekly average rating of 9.7, followed by ``ABC World News
Tonight'' with 9.6 and ``NBC Nightly News'' with 9.3.

   Israeli soldiers killed two guerrillas in a
firefight in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southern
Lebanon, and one soldier was slightly hurt, an army spokesman said.
   He said Tuesday's clash occurred nearly two miles north of the
border, in a deep, vegetation-covered ravine near the Lebanese
Shiite Moslem village of Bayt Lif.
   The spokesman, speaking anonymously under army regulations, said
a patrol encountered a guerrilla group at close range and attacked
it.
   It was not immediately clear whether more than two guerrillas
were involved or to which organization they belonged.
   Israel carved out the six-to-10 mile security zone when it
withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in 1985 following a
three-year occupation.

   What's hot for 1990? Try ``wet'' beer on the
rocks, New Age radio, shorter hair on women and longer hair and
wider ties on men, says the author of ``The American Forecaster
1990.''
   Also hot, says futurist Kim Long, will be the ``smart toilet,''
a Japanese invention that checks a seated person's blood pressure,
pulse, urine, temperature and body weight and displays its findings
on a built-in monitor.
   New Age radio took off so quickly that it is a major trend, said
Long.
   ``It's been called musical wallpaper, at its most disparaging.
It's somewhere between jazz and soft rock, and it has the potential
to not offend a fairly wide proportion of the population,'' he said.
   ``Wet'' beer, a heavier brew served on the rocks, will debut in
1990 along with lower-proof liquor, but low-alcohol beer will
continue to founder, Long said.
   White will be the fashionable color in clothing for women, who
will favor shorter hair, he said. Men will grow their hair longer
and wear wider ties, the Forecaster predicts.
   Long, 40, a Denver free-lance writer who began the Forecaster in
1983, claims an 80 percent accuracy rate. He also predicted a
Dukakis presidency and the demise of television's ``Dallas'' and
``Dynasty.''
   Long's book sells fewer than 10,000 copies despite all the
interest it stirs up in the future.
   ``A popular phrase some futurists are using is that life has the
potential to move forward very rapidly because 80 percent of all
the scientists and engineers who have ever lived are alive today,''
said Long.
   ``The corollary to that is that 80 percent of all the artists,
crackpots and loonies who have ever lived are alive today,'' he
said.

   An 8-year-old boy stuck a message
in a bottle, threw it into the ocean and waited for a response. He
got one five years later _ from England.
   ``Hello Tommy,'' wrote 15-year-old Anya Leeds. ``I don't know
whether you remember sending your note in a bottle. We just found
it on the other side of the Atlantic.''
   ``We were royally shocked,'' said Tom Mote, of Dania, whose son
Tommy put the bottle in the ocean in July 1984. ``I couldn't
believe that bottle had been around for five years.''
   The bottle was found by 10-year-old Gareth Wildman on a beach in
Penzance, on the southwest tip of England. He gave it to Anya, who
worked with her friend, Emma Prowse, 14, to reassemble the message.
   ``The note crumbled to the touch, but we pasted it together,''
Anya said in a telephone interview with the Sun-Sentinel of Fort
Lauderdale. ``It was pretty special to see something so old.''
   Tommy, who's now 13, has become a pen-pal to the two British
girls, his father said.

   Fearing they might miss the last
train to the West, hundreds of East Germans scuffled with
Czechoslovak police to get to the West German Embassy. Many
refugees were injured.
   The desperate struggle came hours before East Germany sought to
curb the exodus of refugees on Tuesday, banning its citizens from
traveling to Czechoslovakia without a visa.
   However, East Germany also decided Tuesday to permit the about
10,000 East Germans around the embassy compound to emigrate to the
West.
   Hundreds of East Germans overturned a police barricade and
scaled facades, rooftops or a 6-foot spiked fence in an effort to
reach the crowded embassy compound, which had been closed earlier
Tuesday.
   Police swung their nightsticks and ``clubbed like mad,'' one
Czechoslovak witness reported. Many refugees were left
blood-spattered.
   More people from the waiting crowd surged toward where the
beatings took place. Refugees quickly built ``a human ladder'' to
help many clear the fence, witnesses said.
   Some became caught on the fence's sharp spikes, while others
jumped or fell head-first to the ground. Some were later seen lying
unconscious inside the compound, the witnesses said.
   Outside the embassy, families with small children were unable to
get inside.
   ``This is pandemonium,'' said a Red Cross assistant handling
injured refugees on the embassy grounds.
   Thousands of other East Germans had packed into the embassy
grounds earlier, and Red Cross officials feared sanitation problems.
   Later Tuesday, young men were seen climbing the embassy facade
from a truck. Refugees inside the compound pulled them in through
windows.
   The crowd of East Germans flocking to the embassy continued to
swell during the day. More newcomers joined them after dark,
shivering in freezing weather as their promised departure by East
German trains was delayed.

<HEAD>Kemp Announces HUD Reform Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is winning support
in Congress for much of his broad plan to curb political influence
in distributing housing subsidies.
   Kemp on Tuesday unveiled a 58-point plan to clean up the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, which would eliminate
spending at the secretary's discretion and impose new management
and ethics regulations.
   ``Many past funding decisions were, frankly, based on political
influence rather than merit,'' Kemp said. ``Under my stewardship,
no decisions will be made at HUD for the political advantage or
personal gain of any one person or of a political party.''
   Kemp, in announcing his program, said he did not believe the
appointment of a special prosecutor was necessary to investigate
allegations of past influence-peddling at the agency.
   Kemp's predecessor, Samuel R. Pierce Jr., and three of Pierce's
former top assistants have refused to testify before Congress,
citing their constitutional rights against self-incrimination.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the chairman of a House subcommittee
that is investigating fraud and mismanagement at HUD during the
Reagan administration, said he supported most of Kemp's plan.
   ``I believe Secretary Kemp is on the right track,'' Lantos said
after meeting with Kemp.
   But Lantos said he was not ready to go along with Kemp's
suggestion that there is no need for the Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation Program. The program has been at the center of the
HUD scandals, and Lantos says it was plundered by political
insiders during the Reagan administration.
   ``It's extremely important we do not allow the scandal during
the previous administration ... to drive us into giving up the
goal, which is to provide affordable, safe, healthy, reasonable
housing for tens of millions of American families,'' Lantos said.
   Lantos' reluctance reflected the program's past support among
congressional Democrats. Although Republicans have been accused of
abusing the program under Pierce, the Reagan administration had
recommended the program be killed and it was congressional
Democrats who annually kept it alive.
   Kemp's proposed changes range from regulatory and administrative
steps he can take immediately to more complex changes that will
require congressional approval.
   Many of the proposals mirror those in a largely ignored 1984
General Accounting Office report to Congress, while others were
molded after more recent proposals in Congress and by Kemp aides to
limit the role of lobbyists and consultants in government funding
decisions.
   Kemp proposed killing another program, HUD's Title X land
development insurance, citing use of the money to build upscale
projects such as a condominium-golf complex in California.
   He said he was committed, however, to maintaining HUD's
co-insurance program, which has been the source of nearly $1
billion in sour loans to date. The program allows private lenders
to approve HUD-insured mortgages and was a major part of the Reagan
administration's efforts to contract federal work to private
contractors.
   ``The problem was not the idea,'' Kemp said. ``The problem was
in the implementation of the idea.''
   Kemp barred from HUD work one company, DRG Funding Corp., which
has had defaults on $709 million of the $1.1 billion in HUD-insured
loans it approved.
   Other highlights include:
   _Appointment of a HUD chief financial officer and a separate
comptroller for its Federal Housing Administration, whose loan
programs have been troubled by fraud and mismanagement believed to
have cost more than $4 billion.
   _Requiring all lobbyists and consultants who work on HUD
proposals to register with the department and disclose their fees,
which HUD could deduct from any funding awards. Kemp asked Congress
to impose civil fines of up to $10,000 for violations of the
registration requirement. He also proposed similar fines for HUD
employees who disclose funding decisions prior to public
announcements.
   _Publishing all HUD funding decisions and waivers in the Federal
Register. Many projects cited in the April audit received waivers
allowing them to receive rent subsidies above HUD limits.
   _Allocating up to $100 million for monitoring HUD housing and
community development programs. Kemp said the department spends
less than $25 million to track annual grants totaling nearly 10
times that amount.
   _Increasing the staff of the department's inspector general and
granting the office the power to subpoena witnesses for its
investigations.

   ``I had to go on television in Europe to refute newspaper

   Ms. Jones, who traveled from Los Angeles to her homeland only to
find the prosecutor failed to show up Tuesday, complained
vehemently of the cost of returning to the Caribbean island for
each new trial date. She traveled from Paris, Madrid and Rome for
previous trial dates that were postponed because prosecutors were
not familiar with the case, judges failed to show up or witnesses
were missing.
   Ms. Jones is charged with possessing 0.007 ounce of cocaine
while vacationing in Kingston. A new trial was set for Oct. 26.

   Former baseball star Steve Garvey's ex-wife,
Cynthia, was released from jail a day after refusing him
court-ordered visits with their two daughters.
   A sobbing Ms. Garvey refused to speak to reporters as she left
the Sybil Brand Institute on Tuesday with her lawyer. The state's
2nd Court of Appeals said the Superior Court ``abused its
discretion'' by not granting bail and ordering her to jail for
contempt of court.
   ``It remains her position that she is not guilty of contempt and
she intends to continue defending herself,'' said attorney Gerald
Margolis.
   Superior Court Judge Frances Rothschild convicted Ms. Garvey of
43 counts of contempt for violating a December 1988 order requiring
daughters Whitney, 13, and Krisha, 14, to spend every Tuesday
afternoon and two weekends a month with their father. Rothschild
ordered her to spend five days in jail and set a Nov. 3 hearing on
a sentence of up to 126 days in jail and two years' probation.
   The Garveys were divorced in 1981 and Garvey recently remarried.
Earlier this year, he admitted fathering the children of two other
women, one of whom is suing him.
   Garvey's attorney, Dennis Wasser, said Garvey was ``somewhere in
Southern California'' with the daughters and would stay with them
through the week.

   Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh has adopted a
new name _ Osho _ and given his followers a change of habit.
   Osho is a Japanese word that means ``the whole man, the fully
awakened one and respectfully symbolizes a man of peace, grace and
love upon whom Existence is showering all its blessings from every
direction,'' according to a statement from the sect's Oregon press
service dated Sept. 15 and received in the mail Tuesday.
   Disciples also have begun wearing maroon robes during the day
and white robes during evening meditations at the commune in Pune,
India, the release said. In the years when the commune was based in
Oregon, Rajneeshees wore various shades of red, but the 58-year-old
guru later advised them to drop the practice to avoid harassment
and discrimination.
   The self-described ``rich man's guru,'' who teaches meditation
as a means to enlightenment, returned to India four years ago after
pleading guilty to U.S. immigration charges.

   Prince Charles says playing polo renews
his mental and physical strength and is good for his image, but he
won't force his sons to play the game.
   ``I do believe it's very important to be seen not to be a
chicken, to be leading from the front, showing you're prepared to
do perhaps some of the more dangerous things,'' the heir to the
British throne said in an interview in Polo Life magazine, a
semiannual publication of Fleet Street Publishing Corp. of
Gaithersburg.
   He says he almost never loses his temper in a match but admits
to some violations of the Queen's English: ``I swear occasionally,
not too loud. On the whole, I remain reasonable.''
   Charles says he hopes his two young sons take up the sport,
although he won't force them to play the game.
   ``What I've really got to do is find an old pony that they can
ride around and try and hit the ball. They've got little sticks and
occasionally we potter about. Yes, it would be lovely if they could
do it because it's lots of fun playing with your own children.''

   Comedian Pat Cooper says his caustic

   For the past 10 years, Cooper has hustled jobs for himself in a

   A leading Hispanic group and the alcohol and
tobacco industries are dismissing claims that beer, cigarette and
fast-food ads are jeopardizing Latinos' health.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a
publication called ``Marketing Disease to Hispanics'' that Latinos
suffer from an increasing number of health problems related to
drinking, smoking and high-fat fast foods.
   The Beer Institute, a trade association, said Tuesday's report
had no scientific basis and rejected suggestions that the beer
industry is promoting alcoholism among Hispanics.
   Institute president James Sanders said money contributed by the
industry to the Hispanic community benefits public health, literacy
and cultural programs as well as economic development.
   ``Problems of nutrition and substance abuse in the Hispanic
community are real, and they deserve real action and real
solutions,'' Sanders said. ``Taking down billboards and shuttering
hamburger stands won't help these very real problems.''
   Anheuser-Busch spokesman Jesse Aguirre said his company's
advertising promotes responsible beer drinking and discourages
alcohol abuse. He called the report ``irresponsible, patronizing.''
   It ``assumes that Hispanic American citizens cannot make sound,
educated consumer decisions just like other segments of the
American public,'' Aguirre said.
   Walker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, a
trade association for the cigarette industry, agreed: ``Anybody who
sees an advertisement for a product is capable of making a decision
about whether to use it.''
   Dr. Carlos Molina, a member of the center's board and president
of the Latino Caucus of the American Public Health Association,
said Hispanic groups have been silent on the issue largely because
they receive about $1 million a year from alcohol, tobacco and
``junk-food'' companies.
   ``That support ... muzzles our national leaders on vital health
issues,'' he said.
   However, the National Council of La Raza, a leading non-profit
Hispanic service organization with affiliates in 26 states,
rejected that conclusion. Susan Herrera, vice president of the
council, estimated the group gets 2 percent of its funding from
beer or tobacco companies.
   ``We don't feel compromised,'' she said. ``If we can't take
people's money and do what we need to do then we shouldn't have any
business taking that money.''
   The council has ``been in the business of drug and alcohol abuse
programs, and we're still operating them,'' she said.
   The report cites studies showing:
   _Men of Mexican heritage have a 40 percent higher risk of death
due to cirrhosis of the liver than white men.
   _In Colorado, lung cancer rates among Hispanic men increased 132
percent between 1970 and 1980, compared with a 12 percent increase
among white men. In New Mexico, lung cancer deaths nearly tripled
for Hispanic men from 1958 to 1982, while doubling for white men.
   _Obesity, linked to adult-onset diabetes, among Hispanic women
over age 18 was about 25 percent more prevalent than among white
women.
   The report calls for higher excise taxes on alcoholic beverages
and cigarettes, a ban on cigarette vending machines and a ban on
all alcoholic beverages and cigarette advertising that links those
products with health and youthfulness.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest is a non-profit
organization that focuses on health and nutrition.

<HEAD>Newspapers Urged to Develop ``Customer Obsession''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newspaper industry, faced with a
decline in readership, must develop ``customer obsession'' to
reverse the slide, the president of the Associated Press Managing
Editors told the APME convention.
   ``Readership surveys can be useful, but they aren't enough,''
said Paul Janensch, editor and general manager of The Rockland
Journal-News in New York City's suburban Rockland County, N.Y.
``Surveys can't halt sliding readership unless the editor and the
editor's staff are fanatical about getting close to the community.''
   Opening the annual APME convention on Tuesday, Janensch said
steadily declining readership ``confronts us with the most serious
problem facing newspapers today'' and that it even hits markets
where the economy is booming.
   ``If you are lucky enough to be in a growing market and your
circulation is going up, you may think you don't have a problem,''
he said.
   ``Wrong. Even where circulation is going up, net newspaper
penetration is going down. There are no exceptions.''
   ``In 1967, about 73 percent of U.S. adults said they read a
newspaper every day,'' he said. ``Last year, the number was down to
51 percent.''
   ``Call it what you will _ customer obsession, putting the reader
first, serving the constituents _ we must do it better,'' Janensch
said. ``I firmly believe that if we build a strong rapport with our
communities, we will prosper. If we don't, we will fade away.''
   While many are captivated by national news and big-name events,
most of America's newspapers survive by providing residents of the
community with information they need in their daily lives, he said.
   ``Is your newspaper first and foremost a local newspaper?''
asked Janensch. ``Do you care as much about the expansion of a
local business as you do about the national trade deficit?''
   In addition to building community ties, Janensch said, a
newspaper's staff must reflect the paper's market.
   ``Does your staff at all levels reflect the racial and ethnic
diversity of your target readership?'' he asked the editors. ``Are
about half of your staffers women? Do your staffers have roots in
the community?''
   Also as the convention opened, a military historian dismissed
suggestions that negative reporting of the Vietnam War damaged the
war effort. Accounts of the Vietnam War often served as a warning
flag for top commanders, who often weren't aware of problems in the
field, said William Hammond, a historian at the Army Center of
Military History in Washington.
   ``Sometimes the commander high up the chain of command is the
last one to find out anything,'' Hammond said.
   ``In this case, media coverage actually extended the vision of
the commander, and he was able to make a response that was very
important to the overall goal of the American military in
Vietnam,'' he added.
   Major stories that would have bruised the Army's image went
largely unreported, including the persistent problems of the M-16,
the primary infantry weapon used in the war, he said.
   Far from aiding the war effort, he said, the lack of reporting
left officials with little incentive to improve.
   ``The press in Vietnam did not pick up the story with any
consistency,'' Hammond said. ``What happened? The military never
had any kind of a prod to do much about repairing the weapon.''
   His book ``The Military and the Media'' stirred controversy when
he said that, overall, news accounts of the Vietnam War gave a
better picture of that conflict than official reports.

   Through a combination of cunning, ruthlessness
and old-fashioned good fortune, Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega has survived yet another challenge to his rule.
   But whatever sense of triumph Noriega felt Tuesday after the
defeat of a military uprising against him, most experts believe he
is weaker now than at any time since assuming the command of the
Defense Forces more than six years ago.
   The Panamanian economy is a wreck, Noriega's base of support has
never been narrower, his diplomatic isolation is almost complete
and he rules over one of the most alienated populations anywhere in
the hemisphere.
   Noriega has won points among some Panamanians by surviving the
unrelenting hostility of the United States. And among this group,
Noriega's ability thus far to win the test of wills with Washington
may have left him standing taller than ever.
   But how far can Noriega continue to coast on his
anti-Americanism? At some point, it appears the combination of
pressures against him eventually will oust him.
   Those pressures are formidable indeed. In early 1988, after
Noriega deposed yet a second president in two years who showed an
independent streak, the Reagan administration moved decisively
against him.
   It froze all Panamanian assets in the United States, withheld
payments to the government relating to Panama Canal operations and
imposed trade sanctions against the country. All this has
contributed to Panama's impoverishment.
   After a period in which the United States looked to Noriega for
help in its effort to bring down Nicaragua's leftist government,
Washington has since done virtually everything in its power to
remove him short of invasion. President Bush insisted Tuesday that
the United States was not behind the anti-Noriega insurrection.
   Besides pinching him hard economically, the administration has
campaigned tirelessly against him internationally and tried to
intimidate him by expanding the size of the U.S. military
establishment based in Panama.
   At a different level, Panama's image was sullied by the U.S.
drug trafficking indictments against Noriega and was damaged even
more by the elections in May when government authorities tossed out
the returns rather than acknowledge the defeat of the pro-Noriega
candidate. For good measure, government agents assaulted opposition
candidates 10 days after the balloting.
   Even the Organization of American States, not known for taking
decisive stands, blamed Noriega for the ``abuses'' surrounding the
elections and called for a democratic transfer of power.
   The OAS effort has since been suspended but Noriega's
international acceptance appears to be at an all-time low. The most
recent blow occurred on Sept. 1 when the Noriega-controlled council
of state named a Noriega crony as president of Panama. It was the
second time in 18 months that Noriega engineered the appointment of
a president with no visible qualifications for the job.
   There is little support around the hemisphere for overt U.S.
military action against Noriega. After all, there is no apparent
danger to the operation of the canal and beyond that, there is
strong support in the hemisphere for the notion that outsiders
should not intervene in the internal affairs of any nation.
   But Noriega is testing the patience of countries which are the
most enthusiastic supporters of that principle. Even Mexico, whose
president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was with Bush when word of
the uprising in Panama reached here Tuesday, is keeping its
diplomatic distance from Panama.
   Although Mexico keeps an ambassador in Panama City, Mexican
officials have told U.S. diplomats they intend to raise their
concerns about Noriega's continued rule with Panamanian authorities.

   When it comes to Manuel Antonio Noriega,
American presidents make no secret of their distaste.
   Ronald Reagan said he wanted Noriega ``out of there.'' His
administration indicted the Panamanian strongman.
   President Bush said the will of the Panamanian people ``should
not be thwarted by this man and a handful of his Doberman thugs.''
He urged the Panamanian people and defense forces to toss him out.
   Jimmy Carter accused Noriega of stealing last year's election.
   But simply walking away wasn't Noriega's way.
   Just as he resisted other efforts to dislodge him, Noriega
apparently succeeded in unhorsing Tuesday's coup attempt by the
very troops he commanded and who kept him in power.
   All manner of ways had been tried to rid Panama of Noriega, but
they all had failed.
   Last year, in February, Noriega was indicted in Miami, then
Tampa, on drug-running charges. The United States wanted to bring
him to trial, but Noriega remained.
   The president of Panama, Eric Delvalle, announced he had fired
Noriega, who put him in office in the first place. But it was
Delvalle who left, fired by the National Assembly.
   Every effort seemed to fail. A coup by Defense Forces officers.
Anti-Noriega marches. An economic squeeze by the United States.
Bargaining for Noriega's departure.
   Nothing worked.
   Last May, Panama held elections. It was clear that the
opposition had won despite massive fraud but still Noriega remained.
   Among the international observers was Carter. He said Noriega
was guilty of thievery and said the election tabulations he looked
at were ``patently counterfeit.''
   Bush said at the time that although Noriega had ignored U.S.
demands for a year, he would leave ``because there has been a
massive voice of the people heard.''
   The president called on foreign leaders to ``urge Gen. Noriega
to honor the clear results of the election,'' and told reporters:
   ``I would like to think that he will heed the call of the people
and that he would listen to the international outcry that is
building and that he would step down from office.''
   In that case, said Bush, ``the relations with the United States
would improve dramatically and instantly.''
   It didn't happen that way.
   The United States long looked the other way when it came to
Noriega, the man with the pockmarked face called La Pina, ``The
Pineapple,'' by his countrymen.
   The Panamanian people had for years heard rumors of what Noriega
was doing: the rigged elections of 1984, the dealing in drugs, the
laundering of money.
   But not until 1987 did they receive confirmation when Col.
Roberto Diaz Herrera, Noriega's No. 2 man, was fired and spilled
the beans.
   Yes, said Diaz Herrera, Noriega had fixed the election; yes,
said Diaz Herrera, Noriega had sold visas; and yes, said Diaz
Herrera, Noriega had engineered the murder of Hugo Spadafora, whose
headless torso was found in August 1985 stuffed in a canvas U.S.
mail bag.
   Until the former aide talked, no one in the Panamanian
military's tight inner circle had accused Noriega of so much as
fixing a traffic ticket.
   But Diaz Herrera's charges spawned the National Civic Crusade,
rebelling at the military's heavy presence. The Crusade called a
strike, followed by mass protests, and Noriega sent soldiers and
riot police to break up a mass rally.
   The United States began paying attention when pro-Noriega forces
attacked the U.S. embassy, splattering it with red paint. The
Reagan administration suspended all military and economic aid.
   Then, the following February, came the indictments, which
accused Noriega among other things of helping Colombia's notorious
Medellin Cartel by providing safe airstrips for its cocaine
shipments.
   Delvalle, scorned by the opposition as a puppet, ordered Noriega
dismissed, but the strongman arranged for the Legislative Assembly
to remove the president.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Noriega is Bush's Political Albatross</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is a longstanding
political albatross for President Bush, and Tuesday's failed coup
attempt in Panama only prolongs the president's burden.
   Bush just can't seem to get Noriega from around his neck, or
from power in Panama, no matter what.
   ``Nothing's changed, our policy remains the same,'' a
disheartened White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
as he confirmed what had already been widely reported _ that the
latest effort to oust Noriega had failed.
   The roller-coaster relationship between the United States and
the Panamanian strongman haunted Bush as a candidate, and the
inability to wrest Noriega from power plagues him as president.
   While denying that Tuesday's failed insurrection was ``some
American operation,'' Bush had all but invited a coup.
   In May he called on the Panamanian people and defense forces to
drive Noriega ``and his Doberman thugs'' from office.
   Yet, Noriega has resisted 2{ years of U.S. efforts to oust him,
survived two coup attempts and harsh U.S. economic sanctions,
evaded drug-dealing indictments, and even emerged from an election
that was _ in Bush's words _ ``blatantly stolen.''
   At a succession of public appearances on Tuesday, Bush was
grim-faced and testy, despite some early reports suggesting Noriega
had been overthrown _ reports that produced fleeting ebullience in
some White House aides, if not in the president.
   Bush insisted to reporters that the United States was not behind
the coup attempt.
   When told that the coup had failed, the president's reaction,
Fitzwater related, was subdued. ``He said OK and went into another
meeting.''
   As a presidential candidate, Bush, then the vice president, was
attacked repeatedly by Democrats for his relationship with Noriega,
particularly regarding when he first learned of Noriega's alleged
involvement in drug trafficking.
   Noriega has had a history of assistance to the CIA and covert
support for the Nicaraguan Contras, although the Reagan
administration became disenchanted with him in the mid-1980s.
   Bush, the former CIA director, insisted he knew nothing of the
drug connection until Noriega's indictment in February 1988 by two
federal grand juries.
   His denial came despite testimony by a former Bush aide, retired
Adm. Daniel Murphy, who told a Senate subcommittee that Bush was
told in CIA briefings as long ago as 1983 that Noriega was
suspected of drug money-laundering.
   Bush continued to deny any advance knowledge of drug dealing by
Noriega _ as he does today.
   In the spring of 1988, reports surfaced that the Reagan
administration was engaged in plea-bargaining negotiations, with a
U.S. proposal to drop charges in return for his relinquishing power.
   Bush tried to distance himself from the negotiations with
Noriega and, in one of his few early breaks with Reagan, said he
would not ``bargain with drug dealers'' at home or abroad.
   Still, Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis told
campaign audiences almost daily: ``I'm not going to be making deals
with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.''
   Bush had little difficulty defeating Dukakis; ridding himself of
Noriega has proved far more difficult.
   The Reagan-Bush administrations considered a wide range of
tactics to topple Noriega _ allegedly including luring him to the
Dominican Republic and kidnapping him _ before settling on economic
sanctions that damaged Panama's economy but barely inconvenienced
Noriega.
   Then, as president-elect, Bush said, ``There must be no
misunderstanding about our policy: Noriega must go.''
   As president, in the aftermath of the violence that followed the
May elections, Bush accused Noriega stealing the vote and declared
he would love to see Noriega ``out of there right now.''
   But, when asked Tuesday night by reporters at a state dinner if
he was disappointed now that such a coup had failed, Bush's
response held none of his former bravado.
   ``I want to see democracy in Panama succeed,'' he said simply.

<HEAD>House Plans Vote on Catastrophic Care Repeal</HEAD>

   The House heads for a showdown today on
whether to repeal catastrophic health insurance, with architects of
the year-old program conceding their highest expectation is to
salvage a only small piece of it.
   Whatever the House vote _ and even backers admitted they
expected a full repeal to prevail _ a final decision on the program
must await negotiations with the Senate later in the fall. A House
vote had been planned Tuesday, but it was delayed amid protracted
debate on other bills.
   There was heavy sentiment in the Senate for repeal, too, but
Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, was seeking
consensus for saving at least the framework of the program, which
was the largest expansion of Medicare since the Great Society
program was created two decades ago.
   The catch has been a bipartisan agreement last year that the
cost of the expanded benefits must be born fully by the 33 million
elderly and disabled people covered by Medicare.
   Congress structured the increased fees so those in higher income
brackets would pay a larger share in proportion to their tax
liability _ up to a maximum of $800 this year.
   But that financing feature generated a firestorm of protest and
overshadowed the big expansion in benefits for hospitalization,
doctor bills and other costs.
   The cry for repeal came mainly from three quarters:
   _Retirees who complained their former employers were already
giving them additional benefits they were being forced to purchase
from Medicare.
   _Upper-income retirees who objected to having to pay a
disproportionate share of the costs to make up for the modest
$4-a-month assessment on the estimated 56 percent of Medicare
beneficiaries who don't have enough money to owe any income taxes.
   _Those who complained that the program did not address the main
need of elderly Americans: insurance for nursing homes and other
long-term care.
   With repeal or a massive rollback a virtual certainty,
congressional health policy leaders said they anticipate even
greater difficulty in the future in winning support for expanded
health programs for the elderly.
   ``Future programs are going to have to be more carefully
considered,'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley told reporters Tuesday.
   Formally called the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, the
program was designed to protect the elderly and disabled from
financial ruin in the event of a prolonged hospital stay or other
high medical costs.
   It would pay for unlimited hospitalization after a once-a-year
deductible of $560 in 1989. Previously, Medicare charged a
deductible for each hospital stay during a year and provided full
payment of hospital bills only up to 59 days a year.
   The plan also would cap, starting Jan. 1, the amount that
beneficiaries must pay for physician services and, beginning Jan.
1, 1991, would phase in a new prescription drug benefit.

   The Marine Corps says a drill instructor is
responsible for the slogan ``kill, rape, pillage, burn'' used by a
group of recruits during basic training at Parris Island, S.C.
   ``This is not a normal occurrence and I would consider this an
isolated incident,'' Capt. J.R. Mill, public affairs officer at
Parris Island, said Tuesday.
   The investigation began after Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
received a photograph of a recently graduated platoon that showed
recruits holding a sign with the slogan and a skull and crossbones.
   Another sign in the picture showed a naked woman.
   Mill said the signs ``were done in bad taste, which represents
neither the policy nor the philosophy of this command or the United
States Marine Corps and we are taking corrective action concerning
this situation.''
   He said the signs ``were made under the supervision and approval
of a drill instructor.''
   The photograph identifies the drill instructor in charge as
Staff Sgt. Kirkpatrick.
   The public affairs office said there was a Staff Sgt. Brian
Kirkpatrick on the base. There was no answer at Kirkpatrick's
office phone Tuesday.
   ``It's outrageous. The Marines ought to be ashamed,'' said
McCain, a highly decorated retired Navy captain who spent 5{ years
as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.
   The 8x10 color, formal photograph showed the men standing at
attention on risers with the officers who trained them in the
foreground. The parents of one of the recruits sent McCain the
photo Monday.
   As part of training, recruits often make signs or pennants with
designs and slogans, but Mill said the ``kill, rape, pillage,
burn'' slogan should not have been condoned.
   Recruits, he said, are schooled in a code of conduct that has
strict rules about humane treatment of civilians, the enemy and
property.
   ``I was in the service 22 years and never saw anything like
this,'' said McCain, blaming the officers in charge. ``It shows a
lack of supervision. We are paying those officers with taxpayers
dollars. We want them to be honorable fighting men.''
   After receiving the photograph, McCain wrote to Marine
Commandant Gen. Alfred Gray.
   ``It is my feeling that ... the signs that the recruits are
holding are inappropriate and do violate the values which Americans
expect their Marines to carry with them in defense of the nation,''
McCain wrote.
   ``While platoon mottoes are important to motivation and morale
in the boot camp environment, the high standards of the Marine
Corps demands a philosophy, a set of values, a dedication and a
resolve with which the enclosed photograph is simply incompatible.''
   McCain asked Gray to ensure that the commanders of the platoon
in the photograph ``understand and embrace proper Marine Corps
values.''
   McCain also asked Gray to make sure the recruits in the
photograph were contacted and ``that they understand why this type
of conduct is inconsistent with the Marine Corps values and
tradition.''

   Pretty and smart, Lori Esker was
president of her high school and the Future Farmers of America
chapter, and was involved in many other activities. But friends say
she was devastated when her romance with a handsome young farmer
broke up.
   Now, she's in jail, accused of strangling the woman he planned
to marry.
   The charge shocked acquaintances in central Wisconsin's quiet
farm country. ``I have never seen her with a temper,'' said Lisa
Steebs, a friend with whom Ms. Esker lived briefly earlier this
year. ``She never swore. She never got mad at anything.''
   Ms. Esker, 20, was charged with first-degree murder Monday in
the Sept. 20 strangulation of 21-year-old Lisa Cihaski. Her body
was found in her car at the motel where she worked near Wausau.
   Ms. Esker admitted killing Ms. Cihaski after an argument over
Bill Buss, but claimed it was in self-defense, according to court
records. A bail hearing is scheduled Thursday in Wausau.
   Broad-shouldered, over 6 feet tall and dark-haired, Buss worked
Tuesday on his family's farm near Eland, about 25 miles east of
Wausau, but said he did not want to discuss the case.
   ``It is a sadness for three families,'' his mother said.
   Friends said Ms. Cihaski planned an engagement to Buss, who
previously dated Ms. Esker.
   When he and Ms. Esker broke up in June, she was devastated, Ms.
Steebs said.
   ``But in the last month, she was over it,'' Ms. Steebs said.
``She had gone out with a couple of other guys. We thought, `Good,
she is getting on with her life.'''
   Ms. Esker lived with Ms. Steebs and her husband for about 45
days last summer.
   ``I could only say something good about her,'' said Swede
Larson, owner of a grocery store in Eland. Larson said he knew Ms.
Esker from years of driving her school bus and from seeing her in
his store this past summer.
   ``It must have been some temper that all at once took ahold of
her,'' he said.
   A family member who answered the door at Ms. Esker's home near
the town of Hatley said the woman's parents would not comment on
the case.
   People in the farming area east of Wausau said Ms. Esker, the
reigning Marathon County dairy princess, was quick to make friends.
She was described as a solid student at University of
Wisconsin-River Falls, where she was majoring in agricultural
journalism.
   At Wittenberg-Birnamwood High School, Superintendent Gerald
Jackson recalled Ms. Esker as a leader in the 440-student school.
She was president of the student body in 1986-87, her senior year.
   The 1987 yearbook listed many activities: president of the
Future Farmers of America, treasurer of the Wisconsin Junior
Dairyman's Association and Future Business Leaders of America, a
member of the National Honor Society, the track team, the debate
team and Students Against Drunk Driving.
   Ms. Cihaski graduated in 1986 and Buss in 1982, the
superintendent said, adding he recalled seeing Buss date both girls.
   Friends say Ms. Cihaski, an assistant manager of sales and
catering at Howard Johnson's Motor Lodge, attended church every
Sunday and regularly bowled with her grandmother.
   ``She was just a sweet, caring, pleasant person, and she was
that way to everybody,'' said Judy Boda, a guidance counselor at
the high school.
   A statement filed with the criminal complaint said Ms. Esker
told investigators she traveled the 150 miles from the university
to Wausau to see Buss and Ms. Cihaski and ``get things straightened
out.''
   While talking in Ms. Cihaski's car in the motel parking lot, Ms.
Esker ``kind of implied'' she was pregnant by Buss, the statement
said. Ms. Esker said Ms. Cihaski then grabbed her throat and she
grabbed Ms. Cihaski, court records say.
   ``I thought she was going to kill me or really hurt me,'' Ms.
Esker's statement said. She said she then grabbed a belt and ``put
it around her neck.''
   When she realized Ms. Cihaski wasn't breathing, she said she
thought, ```Oh my God, I killed her.'''
   Authorities have not confirmed if Ms. Esker is indeed pregnant.
Ms. Steebs said she believes she isn't.
   Sheriff Deputy Randall Hoenisch's report states that Ms. Esker
re-enacted the killing during an interview Friday.
   ``At no time was she hesitant or reluctant to re-enact the
incident,'' Hoenisch wrote. ``In my opinion, Lori Esker is a strong
and powerful woman.''

   Civil libertarians and members of the arts
community seem to be accepting House-passed limitations on federal
aid to ``obscene'' art as restrictions they can accept.
   The House voted 381-41 Tuesday to send the Senate a spending
bill containing the guidelines after adopting them on a voice vote.
Senate approval is expected this week, and President Bush is
expected to sign the measure.
   The restrictions are a retreat from a stricter ban that Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other conservatives fought for over the
last three months.
   The language the House sent the Senate, worked out last week by
House-Senate negotiators, bars the National Endowment for the Arts
and the National Endowment for the Humanities from issuing grants
for exhibitions they consider ``obscene.''
   Included are works depicting sadomasochism, homoeroticism,
sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts.
   To deny financing, endowment officials must also find a work
lacks ``serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.''
   Helms had sought to prohibit federal aid for obscene or indecent
art, and for works offensive to a religion, ethnic group, race, age
group or the disabled.
   ``Given the uproar and general mood these days, probably the
outcome is something we could live with,'' Geoffrey Platt Jr.,
lobbyist for the American Association of Museums, said Tuesday.
   ``When one melds together principle and politics here, the
ultimate result was gratifying,'' said James F. Fitzpatrick,
president of the Washington Project for the Arts.
   Fitzpatrick's organization is among those that have exhibited
one of the shows that sparked the conservative attempts to impose
restrictions on federal arts assistance. It included photographs,
by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, of homosexual acts and of children
in erotic poses.
   The other show contained a photograph by Andres Serrano of a
Christ figure in a jar of urine.
   First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams and American Civil Liberties
Union attorney Barry Lynn said they believed the language is the
first time government aid to art would be limited based on a work's
content.
   ``But it's a compromise, and it's a vast improvement over the
initial language,'' Lynn said.
   ``We reached an agreement that if I had my druthers I'd rather
not have seen,'' conceded Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., who led the
bargaining for the opponents of Helms' proposal. ``But concessions
had to be made.''
   The restrictions would last one year while a newly created
commission studies endowment procedures and considers if permanent
standards should be imposed for federally supported art.
   ``The NEA and the institutions it supports should have higher
standards than the local porno store,'' said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher,
R-Calif., who lost a fight in July to eliminate the NEA's $170
million budget.
   The legislation also requires the NEA to notify Congress 30 days
before issuing grants to the Southeastern Center for Contemporary
Art in Winston-Salem, N.C., which showed the Serrano picture, and
the Institute for Contemporary Art at the University of
Pennsylvania, which exhibited the Mapplethorpe photographs.
   Jack Duncan, counsel to the American Council for the Arts,
called that provision ``a method of intimidation.'' The NEA spent
$45,000 for the two exhibits.
   Many lawmakers had privately expressed a desire to adopt some
restrictions, fearing failure to do so would leave them vulnerable
to election opponents accusing them of favoring pornography.
   After the July fight on Rohrabacher's proposal, the Republican
National Committee sent press releases to the districts of 21
Democrats, accusing them of supporting ``sexually explicit and
anti-religious works of art.''
   The NEA is required by law to support materials that ``in the
experts' view foster excellence, are reflective of exceptional
talent, and have significant literary, scholarly, cultural or
artistic merit.''
   The $11.2 billion measure for the Interior Department, cultural
and other programs is for fiscal 1990, which began Sunday.
   The legislation also extends for another year a ban on the
leasing of offshore tracts for oil and gas drilling; imposes new
restrictions on lobbyists who seek federal money for clients; and
allows lumber companies to cut timber on federally owned land in
the Northwest while protecting areas inhabited by the rare spotted
owl.

   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan wants federal
parks free of throw-away plastic and Styrofoam cups, plates and
utensils.
   Lujan told National Park Service officials this week he would
like the concessionaires in the parks to ban all non-biodegradable
containers, packages and utensils.
   A spokesman said later that Lujan would not object in some cases
to an exception to the rule as long as the plastic items are
disposed of through a recycling program.
   Most plastic utensils and containers made of polystyrene foam _
such as cups and fast-food containers _ are not biodegradable,
meaning that when buried in a landfill they don't disintegrate for
perhaps hundreds of years.
   Environmentalists have complained that the widespread use of
such products has added considerably to the problems of waste
disposal as cities are running out of room for landfills.
   California's Yosemite National Park already has curbed the use
of such items, substituting paper items, and in some cases using a
recycling program for plastic items.
   ``This voluntary initiative, modeled after the successful
program implemented (at Yosemite) will stress the desirability of
utilizing reusable recyclable or degradable products,'' Lujan said
in a memorandum to all Interior Department employees.
   James Ridenour, director of the National Park Service, is
scheduled to discuss Lujan's proposal at a meeting later this week
with about 300 concessionaires who operate everything from
restaurants to snack shops at the parks, according to an Interior
spokesman.
   Of the 350 million visitors to the parks each year, half eat or
drink from a container that is not biodegradable, said Park Service
spokesman George Berklacy.
   Lujan, who has been criticized by environmentalists for not
being a good steward of the public lands, told employees they
should be role models in the area of waste recycling.
   He also ordered the Interior Department cafeteria at the
headquarters building in Washington stop using, whenever possible,
containers or utensils that are not biodegradable unless they can
be recycled.
   Interior spokesman Steve Goldstein said that was a first among
federal departments and agencies.
   ``Although this action may be only a small first step toward
improving our environment,'' Lujan said in the memo, ``we should
set a public example.''
   ``Hopefully by this action we will help foster a new
environmental ethic aimed at conserving the vital natural resources
which we have a duty to manage for all future generations.''

<TEXT>
   Like any good American politician, Soviet
Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov knew what to do when he finished his
private talks in the Oval Office with President Bush.
   Yazov strode out the West Wing doors, past the ever-present
Marine guard, and marched right up to the bank of cameras and
microphones in the driveway Tuesday to offer a personal message of
peace to the American people.
   ``The Soviet people are cherishing the best sentiments and
feelings toward the Americans,'' said the burly, beribboned general.
   ``We were comrades at arms during the Second World War and we
succeeded in winning a great victory. And now we have no grounds,
no reason whatsoever, to go into confrontation (against) each
other.''
   The Soviet general is touring the United States as the guest of
his American counterpart, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   His meeting with Bush was delayed for a half-hour as the
president received an intelligence briefing from national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft on the attempted coup in Panama.
   Bush learned only after the 30-minute session with Yazov that
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's forces apparently had prevailed.
   Reporters were allowed to witness the opening moments of Bush's
meeting with Yazov, and the president broke from his customary
practice by fielding two questions about the coup. Bush
emphatically denied it was ``some American operation.''
   The president asked Yazov to ``pay my respects to President
Gorbachev,'' and said recent talks with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze were ``very fruitful.''
   ``We are satisfied. We've got some problems still,'' Bush said,
but ``things are moving in the direction we wanted.''
   Out on the driveway, Yazov gave a ringing endorsement of the
U.S.-Soviet rapprochement.
   ``The main point of my discussions with the U.S. president was
the question of arms control, the question of reducing conventional
armed forces and weapons and the question of promoting a
relationship between our two militaries and our two nations.''
   Asked if his meeting with Bush had advanced the prospects for an
arms pact, Yazov smiled and said, ``Well, I don't think I could
really assure success at the negotiations within half an hour.''
   But he added, ``Our negotiating teams are working in Geneva. I
think we are moving forward step by step to the ultimate conclusion
of agreements on the questions. Anyhow, we are counting on
progress.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said afterward that
Bush had ``reiterated his support for perestroika,'' and expressed
hope for early agreements on conventional forces in Europe and on
chemical weapons as well as nuclear arms.
   Yazov displayed no pique at being left to cool his heels in the
Cabinet Room and then having events in Panama intrude on the Oval
Office meeting.
   Asked about Noriega, he replied diplomatically.
   ``I am not prepared to talk on the issue because I am not aware
of what happened in Panama. ... We have not talked about it at
all.''
   Yazov said he and Cheney hoped to reach agreements on further
steps to promote U.S.-Soviet military exchanges and ``a whole
program ... designed to promote better understanding between our
two militaries and between our peoples.''
   Earlier, Cheney took Yazov, a Civil War buff, to see the
Gettysburg, Pa., battlefield where Union troops repulsed Gen.
Robert E. Lee's Confederate soldiers in a turning point of the war
between the states.
   Yazov's itinerary included stops today at Camp Pendleton, a
Marine training base in Southern California; Luke Air Force Base in
Arizona on Thursday; and Fort Bragg, N.C., on Friday. He will
return to the capital Friday for a news conference with Cheney.

   Nine of 10 Americans think the country's
traffic problems aren't getting any better, leading many people to
alter their travel plans, a survey said.
   ``Motorists' freedom of mobility is being restricted by
congested roads in all sections of this country and the problem is
not just limited to major urban areas,'' said Kay Aldous, vice
president for public and government affairs for the American
Automobile Association.
   ``Many suburban roads also are being affected,''
   The second annual ``hassle index,'' released Tuesday, was based
on a nationwide survey of 1,743 adults by the U.S. Travel Data
Center in Washington. The results were discussed at a conference in
Hollywood of the Travel Association of America.
   The study showed that 92 percent of drivers believe traffic is
worse or hasn't improved since last year, compared with 86 percent
who felt that way in 1988.
   Nine percent said they wouldn't travel because of congestion,
the same as last year.
   ``This has serious implications for the whole travel industry,''
said Jerry Cheske, a AAA spokesman.
   Forty-eight percent of motorists surveyed said local roads are
more congested than a year ago and 44 percent said it was unchanged.
   Five percent said congestion has eased and the rest were
undecided.
   The biggest concerns about traffic were in the West and
Northeast, where more than 95 percent of respondents said roads are
as bad or worse than last year. The figure for the Southeast was
only 86 percent.
   The survey, which gave no margin of error, found that 83 percent
of respondents who took a vacation trip 100 miles or more by car or
planned to take one this year felt auto travel was worse or at
least as bad, up from 80 percent in 1988.
   Sixty-seven percent said they left earlier to avoid traffic, up
from 59 percent. Twenty-nine percent drove at least 10 miles out of
their way, the same as last year.
   To ease traffic problems, the AAA recommended the federal
government release $10 billion in the Highway Trust Fund to
construct and improve roads, particularly interstate bypasses
around congested metropolitan areas.
   The ``hassle index'' is compiled from AAA's travel attitude
monitor, a report on auto and air transportation that will be
released later this year.

   Leaders of the National Right to Life
Committee say they are stepping up efforts to persuade state
legislatures to restrict abortions.
   David O'Steen, executive director of the group, on Tuesday
rejected claims by pro-choice groups that their political strength
has increased since the Supreme Court ruling last spring allowed
greater leeway for state regulation of abortion.
   O'Steen, at a news conference concluding a two-day strategy
conference, said anti-abortion candidates have won seven of 10
special elections for state legislative seats since that ruling in
a Missouri case.
   Although some polls suggest majority support for abortions,
O'Steen argued that support is only for abortions under narrow
circumstances.
   ``Most Americans think ... abortion is wrong,'' he said.
   The group has prepared model bills that can be introduced by
state lawmakers. However, it declined to release copies of the
proposed state legislation.
   Leaders said the legislation would restrict abortions in a
number of ways, including ``as a form of birth control.'' It also
would call for parental consent in cases of minors seeking
abortions, detail a father's rights in an abortion decision, ban
the use of public funds and ban abortion used for gender selection.
   The broadest prohibition would involve abortions used for birth
control, a term that O'Steen contended describes the purpose behind
93 percent of all abortions.
   Burke Balch, state legislative director of the organization,
said the group would focus on a handful of states where abortion
could become an issue in legislatures during the remainder of 1989.
He said those states were Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida,
Illinois. Texas and Ohio might also be targeted he said.
   Most state legislatures have already adjourned for the year.

   Investors are prepared to help distribute an
abortion pill in the United States if it becomes available, the
developer of the drug says.
   They are ``ready to create a new company for distributing the
drug in the United States and elsewhere if authorized,'' said
Etienne-Emile Baulieu.
   But Roussel-Uclaf, the French company that holds the patent on
the pill, is refusing to license the pill for sale in the United
States or to sell it here on its own, he said.
   The pill also would have to gain federal approval before it
could be sold in this country.
   Baulieu, a biochemistry professor at the University of Paris
School of Medicine, spoke in an interview Tuesday after addressing
an American Medical Association science reporters conference.
   He did not name the investors interested in the pill, which is
called RU 486.
   Baulieu also said he believes that his winning of a major
medical award last week should help prospects for the pill's
introduction to the United States.
   Legislators, judges and others will ``consider that the opinion
of such a prestigious (award) jury gives additional credibility to
the use of such a compound,'' he said.
   Americans ``who are confident in the progress of science with
conscience ... will find ways to have it distributed here,'' he
said.
   Baulieu won the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award
for his work on hormones and for developing RU 486. Anti-abortion
activists criticized the Lasker jury's decision.
   In the interview, Baulieu said he believed the award might help
persuade Roussel-Uclaf to allow American distribution and help
promote American public support for its use, which he called a key
factor in its chance for distribution.
   In France, Baulieu said, the pill has been given to 25,000 women
with a 96 percent success rate. The pill makes the uterus expel the
embryo.
   Baulieu said the pill can save the lives of some 200,000 women a
year who die from botched abortions around the world.
   The pill, which should be taken under medical supervision, also
can ``give more privacy to the decision of pregnancy
interruption,'' he said.

   Drug slogans are meaningless when children
learn substance abuse at home, young people told a pair of House
panels.
   ``There's a lot more than `Just Say No!''' said Serena Peterson,
17, of Newark, Ohio, who described herself as a recovered alcoholic
and drug user who learned substance abuse from her parents.
   ``If I asked for a beer, I got it,'' she said.
   She and others spoke Tuesday before a joint meeting of the House
Budget Committee Task Force on Human Resources and the Select
Committee on Children, Youth and Families.
   Also appearing were educators, doctors and children's rights
advocates who discussed ways to make the budget responsive to
children's needs. But the young people stole the show.
   Keisha Stith, 16, of the Bronx, N.Y., said she ``wasn't even a
teen yet'' when she became pregnant. The mother of a 3{-year-old
son, Kevin, said ignorance was to blame.
   ``This education has to start from the lower grades,'' she said.
   The youngsters also said drug education needed to begin earlier.
   ``When signs are put in front of schools warning that this is a
drug-free zone, the situation has already gone too far,'' said
Freida Dyson, 17, of Harrisburg, Pa., one of nearly three dozen
children invited to Washington to take part in National Children's
Day observances Sunday.
   ``We have to have older students reaching the younger
students,'' said Susan Schneller, an 11th grader from
Lawrenceville, N.J. She said stress is the reason for drug abuse,
sexual experimentation and suicide among teens.
   ``Before they go out and deal with early sex or with drugs, they
have to be able to deal with these pressures,'' she said.
   Jennifer Gamble, 14, of Martinsburg, W.Va., described her work
trying to help the homeless, including raising money for can
openers.
   ``Many of the homeless were being housed in motels,'' she said.
``These people had ample food which had been donated, but they had
no means of opening the cans.''
   Marie Vollestedt, 16, of Bend, Ore., said she started a support
group for children from foster homes after family abuse forced her
into such a home.
   ``All of us need a stable environment,'' she said. ``Foster
children need this even more. In the eyes of many foster children,
the world is full of pain.''

<HEAD>Court Decisions, Crackdown Make Criminal Lawyers Rethink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drug crackdown and a U.S. Supreme Court
decision allowing prosecutors to seize money and property earmarked
for attorneys' fees may chase some of the nation's top defense
lawyers out of criminal law.
   Racketeering laws, they complain, give the government so much
power to confiscate assets that the Sixth Amendment right to choose
one's own attorney may effectively vanish because suspects are left
penniless before trial.
   In June, the high court approved that power, ruling 5-4 that
prosecutors may even seize assets set aside to pay an attorney.
   The power applies to all racketeering suspects, not just accused
drug traffickers, said Neal Sonnett, president of the 15,000-member
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
   ``In this hysteria of getting tough on crime, there seems to be
a feeling that it's OK for the war on crime to become a war on the
Constitution,'' he said.
   The association has made it a policy to help attorneys who are
targeted by aggressive prosecutors, Sonnett said, but many defense
lawyers are discouraged.
   ``I have received communications from attorneys who are
articulating severe gloom, several of whom are saying they may
leave the practice,'' he said.
   One who abandoned criminal law was Miami attorney Joel
Hirschorn, who left private practice after 22 years and joined a
firm to try civil law.
   ``What's going on here is that government, every time I tweak
its nose, can go after my fees,'' Hirschorn said. ``Prosecutors
have the right to shut off the cash flow _ and I have mortgages to
pay.''
   But Miami U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said seizure destroys
the profit motive and can break up a drug ring more effectively
than jail sentences. He said lawyers have no right to argue they
are somehow exempt from the law.
   ``It was very important that the Supreme Court ruled that
defense lawyers are not under a different standard,'' he said.
   Lehtinen said that in his district no lawyer need fear
prosecutors going after fees unless the attorney has taken an
active part in laundering drug money.
   But some attorneys said the threat of seizure is abused in other
districts.
   ``They may start with the drug dealers, but they are going to go
all the way down,'' said Jose Quinon, who defended Medellin Cartel
boss Carlos Lehder Rivas last year.
   ``The final result is that the adversarial system as we have
known it is gone _ the government will choose your lawyer,'' said
Quinon, president of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers.
   Defense attorneys already face the difficult determination of
whether prosecutors will freeze their client's assets. In many
cases, the line between legally and illegally obtained assets is
impossible to draw, they say.
   Edward Shohat, who also worked on the Lehder case, said trying
to figure out prosecutors' intentions is almost impossible.
   ``There is no pattern to it,'' Shohat said. ``I've had cases
where you would have thought they would act, but there was no
seizure, while in other cases, you wonder why they did.''
   That means that a defense lawyer must first spend his time and
his client's money just defending his fee, instead of preparing a
criminal defense.
   Joseph Beeler, who participated in the Supreme Court case that
led to the ruling, said prosecutors use of seizure to scare off
lawyers, a use of the Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations
Act that Congress never intended.
   On a personal level, Beeler said, ``I've certainly turned down
business _ and I hate to do it _ because the government has made it
impossible for them to defend themselves.''
   One result of private attorneys balking at taking criminal cases
will be an increasing load on already overworked public defenders,
said Robyn Blumner, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Florida.
   Sonnett said attorneys have been sounding out Congress about an
exemption for attorneys' fees, but he acknowledges the political
climate makes it difficult for Congress to appear as if somehow
supporting drug dealers.
   For now, many lawyers say they will continue their criminal
practice, but the days of an elite group of top criminal attorneys
may be numbered.
   `In the next couple of years, you will see some of the best and
the brightest leaving criminal practice,'' Quinon said. ``People
are already beginning to handle civil cases. That was unthinkable a
short while ago.''

   The army twice blocked journalists from meeting
Palestinians, and a leading Palestinian activist called the actions
signs that Israel is losing its battle against the 21-month-old
uprising.
   Also Tuesday, debate intensified in Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's coalition government over whether to accept Egypt's offer
to arrange peace talks. Israel's two main parties headed for a
possible showdown at an inner Cabinet meeting Thursday.
   The army on Tuesday barred Palestinian activists from holding a
news conference in predominantly Arab east Jerusalem and halted a
U.N.-sponsored press tour of Palestinian refugee camps in the
occupied West Bank.
   Palestinian activist Faisal Husseini told reporters at a police
barricade that by banning the news conference Israel was showing
that it is failing in efforts to quell the uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We believe that we can win and what you are seeing now it is
the signs of the beginning of the end of the occupation,'' he said.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek complained about the closure on
Israel radio, saying: ``They did not ask us, did not inform us of
the reasons ... I think this arrangement is wrong and I plan to
clarify that with the chief of command. The question is whether it
could be justified by security reasons, because it's becoming a
routine and this is not good.''
   Police showed reporters an order issued by Maj. Gen. Yitzhak
Mordechai of the army's central command declaring the scene of a
news conference a ``closed military area.''
   The news conference had been called to protest an army crackdown
on the Christian town of Beit Sahour, which has mounted a civil
disobedience campaign, refusing to pay taxes and boycotting Israeli
products.
   Olivier Rafowitz, a spokesman for the army-run West Bank
government, said the army would this week begin auctioning goods
confiscated in tax raids on Beit Sahour. About $500,000 worth of
televisions, cars and furniture have reportedly been seized.
   About 45 foreign reporters and photographers traveling in a U.N.
bus were turned back by the army at a West Bank checkpoint while
hundreds of private vehicles were allowed to pass, including those
of Jewish settlers carrying weapons.
   A statement issued by the army spokesman's office in Tel Aviv
criticized the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for failing to
coordinate the visit in advance and said the army feared the
presence of journalists would incite violence.
   More than 580 Palestinians have died in clashes with soldiers
and Israeli civilians during the uprising. Forty Israelis have been
slain. At least 123 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs
as suspected collaborators.
   Differences in the coalition Cabinet focus on Shamir's
objections to a Palestinian delegation for peace talks that would
include deported pro-Palestine Liberation Organization activists.
   The talks would be over holding elections in the occupied
territories.
   The United States and Israel's left-leaning Labor Party favor
the proposed Cairo talks. But Shamir's Likud bloc fears that any
meeting with the expatriate Palestinians would be seen as implicit
recognition of PLO demands for the right of 5 million Palestinians
to return to land that is now part of Israel.
   Yossi Ben-Aharon, a Shamir aide, suggested a compromise may be
possible under which Egypt, Israel and the United States would
convene for exploratory talks on the composition of a Palestinian
delegation.
   President Bush on Monday told Shamir that he was willing to try
to arrange a summit with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.

<TEXT>
   The union representing 57,000 Boeing Co.
employees went on strike early Wednesday in its first strike
against the world's largest aerospace company in 12 years.
   Machinist union members in Seattle, Portland, Ore., Wichita,
Kan., and elsewhere began the walkout at 12:01 a.m. local time,
union officials said.
   In Seattle on Tuesday, the union overwhelmingly rejected what
Boeing said would be its final contract offer.
   Union leaders had said they would notify a federal mediator, who
joined negotiations last weekend, that they would be willing to
consider resuming negotiations.
   But Tom Baker, president of the Machinists' District Lodge 751,
said the union would not be in favor of extending the midnight
strike deadline.
   Boeing issued a statement several hours after the strike vote,
expressing disappointment but vowing to continue operations with
supervisors and non-striking workers.
   ``Our airline customers have been notified of a strike and our
intention to support deliveries to the best of our ability,'' the
Boeing statement said. ``It is impossible to make a general
statement on all defense and space programs since they are at
various stages of development and production.''
   Baker said the main reason for the strike vote was a feeling
that Boeing workers deserved a greater share of the company's
record prosperity.
   Boeing, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, is
enjoying its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders, with
carriers and leasing companies ordering 736 planes worth $38.5
billion so far this year.
   ``We have gone through the hard times with this company,'' Baker
said. ``We just want to go through the good times with them as well
as the hard times.'' Boeing offered an immediate raise of 4
percent, with 3 percent raises in 1990 and 1991. The proposed
three-year contract also contained annual bonuses of 8 percent of a
worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent the next, insurance
improvements and reduced compulsory overtime requirements to 160
hours a quarter.
   Workers filling more than half of the 65,000-seat Kingdome
jeered the offer and folded summaries of it into paper airplanes
that sailed through the stadium.
   Boeing Machinists voting in Seattle, Wichita, Portland, and
elsewhere were asked to decide whether to accept the contract, a
simple majority vote, and whether to strike, which requires a
two-thirds majority of members voting.
   Union leaders told the Machinists, who last struck Boeing in
1977 for two months, the time was right to demand more.
   ``If you aren't tough enough to secure a decent contract this
time you'll never get one,'' said Justin Ostro, general union vice
president and bargaining coordinator.
   ``If you turn tail and run, don't come back in three years''
expecting great change, he added. ``There is no good time to
strike. There is only the right time.''
   Though Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business, one
division, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, has a backlog of nearly
1,600 jets worth about $70 billion and deliveries extending well
into the mid-1990s.
   For 1988, profits were $614 million on $16.96 billion in sales.
Boeing also is holding $3.66 billion in cash and short-term notes.
   Baker said a strike could last ``a week. It could be months.''

<HEAD>Fairness Doctrine Included in Budget Reconciliation Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House is trying once again to write a
fairness doctrine to require broadcasters to air opposing
viewpoints on controversial issues.
   On a 261-162 vote Tuesday, the House refused to strip the
fairness provision from a budget reconciliation bill.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said opponents of the fairness
doctrine had used the threat of a presidential veto as a ``red
herring.''
   ``The threat of a veto does not exist,'' said Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., who as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
has been the main backer of the move to codify 40-year-old rules
the Federal Communications Commission abandoned in 1987.
   The FCC said the doctrine violated the First Amendment and no
longer served the public interest in an era of numerous media
voices.
   Congres wrote the doctrine into law last year, but it was vetoed
by President Ronald Reagan. President Bush has indicated he would
follow suit if such a bill reached his desk, but he hasn't said
what he would do if it were contained in a reconciliation bill,
which contains Bush's hard-won capital gains tax reduction.
   The Energy and Commerce Committee added the fairness doctrine
provision to the reconciliation bill earlier this year, giving the
FCC new authority to impose fines on stations found to be violating
the doctrine.
   Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, offered an amendment Tuesday to
delete the fairness doctrine from the reconciliation bill, saying
the committee added the civil fines only to make the provision
germane to budget legislation.
   Oxley said the FCC never administered fines while the fairness
doctrine was in effect from 1949 to 1987 and never sought the
authority to do so.
   ``What this amounts to is simply government intrusion on free
speech and government micromanagement of the news,'' Oxley said.
   But Markey said the fairness doctrine would assure that
broadcasters cover important community issues ``in a fair and
balanced manner.''
   A Senate fairness doctrine bill was approved in April by the
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee but has not come to
the floor for a vote.
   If a fairness doctrine passes Congress and Bush signs it, a
Supreme Court test is likely, based on what opponents say is the
doctrine's unconstitutional infringement on broadcasters' rights.
   A federal appeals court earlier this year ruled that the FCC had
the authority to scrap the doctrine, but the court sidestepped the
issue of the doctrine's constitutionality.
   Many broadcasters, particularly small-station owners, oppose the
fairness doctrine, saying the threat of lawsuits is enough to make
them ``just play music'' instead of discussing controversial issues.

<TEXT>
   The disappearance of six children of dead
polygamist leader Ervil LeBaron dims hopes of breaking two decades
of religious violence in which more than 20 people were slain,
authorities say.
   The six fled foster homes in Salt Lake City on Friday and may be
headed to a family hideout in Mexico, authorities said.
   ``It's sad,'' said Dave Schwendiman, assistant U.S. Attorney for
Utah, who heads a ``LeBaron Crime Family'' task force. ``You think
maybe you have a chance to stop the violence and give these kids a
chance for a normal life ... and then it blows up on you.''
   The children were identified as Norma LeBaron, 18; Nikki
LeBaron, 17; Jessica LeBaron, 15; Jerod LeBaron, 14; Daniel
LeBaron, 13, and Joshua LeBaron, 12.
   Authorities believe LeBaron's eldest surviving son and clan
patriarch, Andrew, may have organized their escapes, Salt Lake
County Attorney's Investigator Lt. Dick Forbes said.
   Andrew, 29, and brothers Aaron, 22, and Heber, 25, are believed
to have led the clan in a recent series of killings that followed
the practice of blood atonement preached by their father,
authorities said. Heber and Aaron are in custody.
   Relatives believe the three brothers are executing a hit list
written by their father, who founded the violent Church of the Lamb
of God and was convicted of ordering the 1977 slaying of a rival
Utah polygamist.
   LeBaron, who had a dozen wives and fathered more than 50
children, died of a heart attack in 1981 at age 56 in the Utah
State Prison. Authorities and relatives describe his ``Book of New
Covenants,'' written in prison, as a blueprint for revenge against
those LeBaron believed abandoned him after his arrest.
   The clan is a radical offshoot of the Mormon Church, which now
bans polygamy.
   The six children were placed in foster homes after being
subpoenaed along with other family members by the U.S. Attorney's
Office in Salt Lake City for a grand jury investigation into the
Oct. 16, 1987, killing of Daniel Ben Jordan, a Colorado polygamist
and former LeBaron lieutenant.
   Authorities said the children refused to cooperate with the
investigation out of fear of retribution from other family members.
   The clan has been dealt a series of blows in the past two years
with the arrests of more than a dozen members.
   Heber LeBaron and four others are in prison in Arizona,
convicted of operating a truck theft ring to finance the family.
Heber also is wanted in Houston for attempting to kill a guard in a
credit union holdup.
   Aaron LeBaron and two other members are being held in Chicago on
federal charges of possessing false identification papers.
   Andrew may have sought to gather remaining family members and
regroup in Mexico, said Forbes, who has tracked the clan for more
than a decade.
   The three brothers remain suspects in the killings of three
former LeBaron followers and the daughter of one of the victims in
Houston and the Dallas suburb of Irving on June 27, 1988. They also
are suspects in the disappearance of former LeBaron apostle Leo P.
Evoniuk near Santa Cruz, Calif., in May 1987.
   Other members are in hiding, believing they are on the hit list,
Forbes said. They include Rena Chynoweth, a former wife of Evril
LeBaron, and her mother, Thelma, who were trying to adopt the six
youngsters when they disappeared.
   Rena's brothers, Mark and Duane Chynoweth, were killed in
Houston, along with Duane's 8-year-old daughter, Jennifer.
   ``They killed my brothers and my sister and my niece,'' said
Glenn Chynoweth, Rena's brother, who lives in Sunset. ``I wanted to
break that chain so we don't have some up and coming young ones to
be trained in violence.''

   Tens of thousands of people are arriving in
the nation's capital to urge Congress and the Bush administration
to lift the homeless from the streets and make housing more
affordable for all Americans.
   Organizers wouldn't say Tuesday what turnout they expect for
three days of activities culminating in a ``Housing Now!'' march
Saturday on the national Mall.
   But the breadth of their sponsorship, coupled with a massive
planning effort dating to early in the year, could produce one of
the largest demonstrations Washington has seen in years.
   ``We're saying enough is enough,'' said Washington homeless
activist Mitch Snyder. ``Today the streets in Boston, New York and
Washington look like those in Calcutta. This demonstration is to
provide some will and some backbone to the administration and
Congress.''
   Activists complain the Reagan-Bush administrations cut the
budget authority for federal housing assistance programs by 77
percent _ from $32 billion to less than $8 billion a year _ and
cite that as the principal reason for the growing numbers of people
who are without homes.

   Can't Fly

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The health of a terminally ill Defense
Department employee may have deteriorated too much to allow him to
take advantage of offers from volunteers to fly him for free back
to his Massachusetts home.
   The offers were made after the Defense Department refused a
request from the wife of Avram Brody, to fly him on an Air Force
air-ambulance flight from Palmdale, Calif.
   Amy Brody said her husband, a three-year Defense Department
computer operator, wanted to return to Massachusetts where he was
born and raised so he could be among relatives and friends for the
last weeks of his life.
   Brody, 25, was diagnosed last year with terminal brain cancer.
It would have cost roughly $29,000 to hire a private air ambulance.
   Air Force officials refused a transcontinental flight, even when
congressmen and a White House aide were enlisted to help Brody.
   Mrs. Brody said Tuesday she did not know if her husband's
condition might improve enough to make a flight offered by private
citizens possible. Brody has already outlasted the life expectation
given by doctors by several months.

<NOTE>Bentsen Includes `Tight Sands' Tax Incentive in Bill</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is asking the Senate to
reinstate a tax benefit for the natural gas industry that he says
would result in hundreds of new wells being drilled in Texas and
thousands more across the country.
   Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates indicate the
tax break would cost the U.S. Treasury $40 million in 1990 and $180
million by 1994.
   Bentsen, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the
so-called ``tight sands'' tax credit is an incentive for producers
willing to explore for natural gas in difficult geological
formations such as the Carthage Valley in East Texas and the Cisco
Canyon area of West Texas.
   ``These formations contain small pockets of gas rather than the
more common large pools which have been developed in prior years,''
Bentsen, D-Texas, said Tuesday. ``These small pockets of gas are
difficult to find and expensive to produce.''

<HEAD>Panama's Wily, Ruthless Defense Forces Chief Savors a Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who once
called his opponent's bullets ``kisses,'' is a shrewd and ruthless
survivor who revels in power and in thumbing his nose at what he
calls ``the colossus of the North.''
   On Tuesday, elements of the 15,000-man Defense Forces he
commands claimed they had deposed him. But once again, he dodged
the bullet and showed up Tuesday afternoon to accept the rebels'
surrender.
   It is known that ``Tony'' Noriega enjoys a crisis, and events of
the last 18 months would have driven a less determined man into
retirement.
   Many Panamanians want him out. The United States, which indicted
him on drug-trafficking charges in February 1988, has tried
everything short of military force to remove him. The international
community has condemned him.
   But Noriega, who comes from El Chorrillo, the Panama City
district where Defense Forces headquarters is located, has survived
and created a mystique.
   It is said he thrives on pressure and would prefer death to
losing power. That is part of machismo that won him the nickname
``The Man,'' the English word his initials spell.
   Noriega has wrapped himself in nationalism, saying it is part of
the historic mission of his generation to take control of the
Panama Canal. Under an accord with the United States, Panama is to
take over the canal by the year 2000.
   During his last crisis in May after the opposition swamped his
candidate in presidential elections that were annulled by the
government, Noriega was seen standing alone before the tomb of his
patron, Gen. Omar Torrijos.
   The epitaph on the tomb is: ``I don't want to enter heaven. I
just want to enter the Canal Zone.''
   Torrijos, who seized power in a 1968, signed the 1977 accord
with former President Carter to turn over the canal. Torrijos was
killed in a plane crash in 1981, and Noriega became commander of
the Defense Forces in 1983. The position has allowed him to control
the government.
   Noriega says his enemies are fomenting a plot to abrogate the
canal pact.
   The general was raised by foster parents and joined the Defense
Forces in 1962. His ascent began when he caught the attention of
Torrijos, then an ambitious young officer.
   In his climb to the top, he dealt with everyone from the CIA to
Colombian cocaine cartels.
   Less than a year after Torrijos gained power in 1968 coup, he
made Noriega, then an obscure major, chief of intelligence with the
rank of lieutenant colonel.
   It was like having the keys to the city. Noriega immediately
began assembling dossiers on everyone who counted in Panama.
   Noriega's job also put him in close contact with U.S.
intelligence agencies, and he formed powerful alliances.
   One U.S. official who dealt with Noriega at the time, on drug
enforcement efforts, said Noriega was polite but when it came to
something he wanted, he was ``the coldest man I ever met.''
   After Noriega became the Defense Forces commander, he acquired a
fleet of expensive cars and a home in an exclusive neighborhood.
   He reportedly is involved in a vast array of businesses
including hotels, casinos, a television station, radio stations,
maritime services, duty-free liquor stores and prostitution.
   Rumors about his personal life are plentiful, but there are few
facts. Even his age is in dispute. The general says he is 51, but
the date in his high school yearbook would make him 54. He is
married and has a daughter who lives in the Dominican Republic.
   Although his private life is that of a rich man, he worked hard
to develop a populist image modeled on the revered Torrijos,
spending weekends meeting with residents of towns and villages in
this nation of 2.2 million.
   Noriega often speaks of his humble origins and characterizes his
domestic opponents as rich and white.
   ``The humble, the poor and the blacks, they are the utmost
authority of the people,'' he once said.
   As the standoff with the United States dragged on in past
months, Noriega enjoyed underlining Washington's helplessness,
despite the 12,000 troops it has stationed in Panama.
   Noriega exercises his power with ruthless assurance. He has
closed newspapers for months at a time, and presidents served at
his pleasure.
   Rumors of opposition inside the Defense Forces _ such as the
March 16, 1988 coup attempt _ were met with purges and
reorganizations.
   ``Kisses,'' was how he described the bullets fired in that
attempted coup.
   The United States, long his ally, began to distance itself after
the headless body of one of his opponents, Hugo Spadadora, was
found in a U.S. mailbag in Costa Rica in 1985.
   A full break came in February 1988, when two federal grand
juries in Florida indicted Noriega on drug-trafficking and
money-laundering charges.
   The domestic opposition began to intensify its campaign against
Noriega and Washington imposed crippling economic sanctions.
   Noriega didn't budge.
   Shortly after the indictments in Floria, Noriega delivered a
speech. He brandished a machete above his head, then brought it
crashing down on the podium.
   ``Not one step back!'' he shouted.

<HEAD>Coast Guard: Overworked Captain Still Should Have Avoided Grounding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tanker captain was sleepless,
distracted and had no lookout when his ship hit a reef and spilled
289,000 gallons of oil, but he still should have avoided the
accident, a Coast Guard investigator says.
   ``I think he knew where he was,'' Capt. David H. Whitten said
after listening to 2{ hours of testimony Tuesday from Iakovos
Georgoudis, captain of the World Prodigy.
   The ship hit a reef off Newport on June 23, spilling the heating
oil.
   The captain's workload contributed to the accident, Whitten
said, but ``you can't regulate that. He's expected to handle
distractions.''
   Georgoudis told Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety
Board investigators he had been in control of the ship for 36
hours, catching at most two hours of sleep the morning before the
accident. Georgoudis said he stayed on the bridge that long because
of poor visibility, which did not clear until that morning.
   Georgudis said he sent his chief officer below to do
calculations for unloading the cargo at Providence after the
shipping agent messaged the Greek tanker that there might be a
second, previously unscheduled stop.
   Georgoudis said that when the chief officer took longer than
expected, he called for a second officer to help him, but the
message apparently never was relayed.
   He also said he had sent his lookout to help a harbor pilot
board and was alone with a helmsman when the ship hit Brenton Reef.
   ``I was everything'' at that point, trying to handle radio
traffic, navigation and various calculations, Georgoudis said.
   Georgoudis said he saw a buoy warning of the reef about 30
minutes before the accident, but he could not explain the grounding.
   ``That's my big question,'' Georgoudis said. He said he noticed
he was on the wrong side of the buoy only ``when the buoy was very
near my bow.''
   The captain said he discovered only moments before the accident
that he was northeast of where he was to have met the harbor pilot.
He said he heard no radio warnings from the pilot boat until the
World Prodigy hit the rocks at about 10 knots.
   The captain acknowledged that Ballard Shipping Co., the tanker's
owner, and Greek regulations required a lookout when entering a
harbor. Georgoudis said he had been in Providence harbor once
before, in 1987, on a different ship.
   Defense lawyer Peter DiBiase refused to let Georgoudis, 43,
answer questions after the hearing and said the captain would
return immediately to Greece.
   Georgoudis agreed to testify after pleading guilty Friday to one
misdemeanor count of violating the federal Clean Water Act and no
contest to a state pollution charge. He was fined $30,500.

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors contended that PTL founder
Jim Bakker solicited money for lifetime partnerships at his
Heritage USA retreat and used the money for his own benefit rather
than for the lodging he promised. The defense said Bakker was a
victim of circumstance, a devout minister who was not blessed with
good business sense.
   Here is a look at some key points raised by the prosecution and
defense.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PROSECUTION: Bakker hid information from the PTL board of
directors and did not give the board a true financial picture of
PTL's problems.
   DEFENSE: Bakker said the board was aware of cash flow problems
and voted to borrow funds to pay for them.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PROSECUTION: The Bakkers used PTL funds to support their lavish
lifestyle, receiving more than $3 million in bonuses in the
mid-1980s, often during periods of financial trouble for the
ministry when many PTL employees were laid off.
   DEFENSE: Bakker said the board members voted for bonuses ``of
their own free will,'' adding that he accepted $3.1 million, less
than 1 percent of what he raised for the ministry.
   __
   PROSECUTION: Bakker was creating ``a false sense of urgency'' in
1984 when he told viewers that 50 percent of the 25,000
partnerships at Heritage Grand Hotel were taken when computer
records showed fewer than 4,000 had been bought.
   DEFENSE: Bakker said PTL's computers typically ran six months
behind.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PROSECUTION: Former top Bakker aide David Taggert testified that
Bakker had him relay instructions to divert Lifetime Partnership
money to PTL's general expenses.
   DEFENSE: Bakker said Taggert was lying.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PROSECUTION: Bakker fleeced followers by overselling ``lifetime
partnerships.'' Lifetime partners paid $1,000 for an annual
guarantee of three night and four days at Heritage USA.
   DEFENSE: Partnerships were not sales transactions and the
payments were gifts to the ministry. The ministry had adequate
facilities to handle more than 150,000 partnerships already sold.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PROSECUTION: Called witnesses who said they were turned away
when they tried to use their lodging benefits.
   DEFENSE: Countered by calling to testify ``lifetime partners''
who said they never had trouble getting space in Heritage USA
facilities.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PROSECUTION: Backing the contention that Bakker dipped into PTL
funds for personal use, former PTL executive Richard Dortch
testified that Bakker authorized a $265,000 payoff in PTL funds to
Jessica Hahn to keep her quiet about their sexual encounter.
   DEFENSE: A former builder for PTL, Roe Messner, who handled the
payment to Miss Hahn, testified that when he asked Dortch if Bakker
knew about the payment, Dortch replied: ``No, I'm acting on my
own.''

<HEAD>First Sign of Uprising: Gunshots At 7 a.m.</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Elements of Panama's military attempted to
overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega for the second time in 18
months Tuesday, but loyalist troops defeated them. Here is an
account of the failed coup, compiled from reports by Associated
Press reporters on the scene and in Washington:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>___</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first sign of the uprising comes
at 7 a.m., when gunshots sound through the poor, crowded Panama
City neighborhood of El Chorillo.
   The Urraca battalion, entrusted with the security of Panamanian
Defense Forces headquarters, is in revolt.
   The sounds are heard at the headquarters of the U.S. Southern
Command, less than a mile away.
   Hundreds of people living near the embattled headquarters leave
or are forced from their homes, some fleeing with pets and all the
household belongings they can carry.
   Police, armored personnel carriers and water cannon block the
streets, keeping journalists and the curious away. Shops pull down
their shutters.
   At 7:20 a.m., the Southern Command puts its troops and civilians
on the highest alert. President Bush, in Washington, is informed.
   Gunfire crackles through the morning. Stray bullets hit
buildings in the neighborhood, but no civilian injuries are
reported. The Red Cross says doctors have been called to the
compound.
   U.S. troops in combat gear take up positions 600 yards from the
Defense Forces headquarters, between the gunfire and U.S. bases.
However, they take no part in the fighting.
   U.S. helicopter gunships and Blackhawk troop carriers fly over
the installations. U.S. troops and armored personnel carriers close
the Bridge of the Americas, which crosses the Panama Canal west of
Panama City.
   As the morning wears on, National Security adviser Brent
Scowcroft briefs Bush and visiting President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari of Mexico.
   Former Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, also in Washington,
says discontented officers who were passed over for recent
promotions were attempting the coup.
   Meanwhile, troops loyal to Noriega are moving out of their
barracks. Battalion 2000, named for the year Panama is to gain
control of the Panama Canal, leaves Fort Cimarron, 25 miles east of
the city; the Machos de Monte come from Rio Hato, 55 miles west.
   At 11:30 a.m., as sporadic gunfire continues, the rebels issue
their first and only communique in the name of Maj. Moises Giraldi
Vega, commander of the Urraca battalion.
   In a radio broadcast, the rebels say Noriega and six of his top
colonels have been ousted. The rebels call on other Defense Forces
units to join them and say they will call elections soon.
   Opposition supporters hit the streets to celebrate, waving flags
and blowing whistles, but half an hour later officers loyal to
Noriega call a television station and say they are fighting back
``ready to give their lives.''
   Troops loyal to Noriega have climbed to the rooftops outside the
compound to bombard rebel soldiers with mortars, grenades and
gunfire. The Urraca unit returns the fire.
   At about 12:30 p.m. machine gun, bazooka and mortar fire rips
through the neighborhood. A rocket crashes into a building, setting
it afire, and anti-aircraft weapons fire wildly.
   People run screaming in the street. The sound of the crossfire
is punctuated by a man who yells, ``Stop sinning. Christ is the
salvation.''
   Noriega's forces are in control by about 1 p.m., although
sporadic firing in the area continues for at least three hours.
Captured rebel soldiers are lined up with their hands on their
heads; one is almost stripped naked.
   In Washington, Bush says the United States has good relations
with the Defense Forces and its only argument is with Noriega. He
also says the coup attempt is not ``some American operation.''
   By 3 p.m., Noriega spokesmen say the coup attempt has been put
down and the Defense Forces have confirmed their loyalty to the
general. Defense Forces spokesman Maj. Edgardo Lopez says several
people were wounded but says there were no deaths. He says at least
60 soldiers and four or five officers have been detained.
   The government announces an 8 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew. People flock
to grocery stores, stocking up on supplies in case the situation
deteriorates.
   Bush admits he is disappointed that the coup failed.
   At about 4 p.m., Noriega and tells a national television
audience the coup attempt was part of the United States'
``permanent aggression'' against Panama. He says all parts of the
country are under control.
   As darkness begins to fall, Noriega emerges from the
headquarters compound and waves to reporters. The fate of the
rebels is unknown.

   I was in an apartment building
overlooking the Defense Forces headquarters, trying to get a
telephone line to report on the coup attempt against Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   After waiting half an hour, I finally got a line, but then there
was a loud explosion. People began screaming and throwing
themselves onto the floor. An old woman hugged her poodle. The
telephone line went dead.
   About 100 yards away, troops loyal to Noriega had reached
Defense Forces headquarters, captured five hours earlier by
dissident troops trying to oust him.
   At 12:30 p.m. Tuesday, they began exchanging fire with machine
guns, bazookas and mortars.
   Some loyalist troops were behind roadblocks along the normally
busy street in front of the bayside barracks. Others advanced
through a graveyard on one side of the barracks, hiding behind the
tombstones.
   The shooting went on for half an hour, and the sky filled with
gunsmoke.
   The sound of the battle was punctuated by a religious fanatic
who kept crying: ``Sin no more! Christ is salvation!''
   Residents who had not evacuated the crowded slum apartment
buildings in the El Chorrillo neighborhood screamed in panic. Some
officers ordered them out, but others told them not to go outside.
They didn't know what to do.
   About 10 minutes after the battle began, I looked out the window
and saw a rocket crash into a nearby building. Shrieking people
were running down the sidewalk.
   Then the shooting stopped. One soldier was captured by loyalist
troops on the street outside the long, low wall that surrounds the
Defense Headquarters compound.
   They took away his weapon and stripped him almost naked before
taking him inside, hands on his head.
   Life slowly returned to the Avenue of the Martyrs.
   ``Chicha, chichime,'' cried a soft drink vendor, peddling fruit
drinks only an hour after the heavy firing had ended.
   I looked to where the roadblocks had stood. They had disappeared
as if by magic. There was still some shooting in the neighborhood,
however.
   A few hours later, Noriega strolled down the bullet-pocked steps
of Defense Forces headquarters.
   He raised his right hand, smiled and waved.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined against the Japanese yen today
amid apparent massive dollar-selling by central banks, while the
key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose slightly.
   The dollar closed at 140.60, down 0.05 yen from Tuesday's close.
It had opened at 141.05 and climbed as high as 141.85 yen at one
point. The day's low was 140.50 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average rose 16.43 points, or 0.05 percent, to
35,382.80, reversing its fall in the morning. Volume was 850
million shares.
   The dollar's early gains in Tokyo followed an upswing on
overseas markets overnight, traders said.
   In the morning, banks from Singapore bought West German marks
for yen, sending the dollar upward, while traders virtually ignored
Bank of Japan intervention aimed at keeping the dollar down, said
Minori Takeuchi, a trader at Chemical Bank.
   ``But in the afternoon, the Bank of Japan again intervened and
there were rumors of intervention by the Bank of England and the
(German) Bundesbank, causing the dollar to decline gradually,'' she
said.
   ``We think the central banks sold huge amounts of dollars,'' she
said.
   Japan's central bank does not comment on its exchange market
activities.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei average lost 13.41
points, falling to 35,352.96 within the first 15 minutes of morning
trading. It had lost 256.60 points the previous day.
   The index rose gradually in the afternoon, but dealers said
there was no clear direction.
   Takahide Furuhashi, head of analysis at DB Capital Markets, said
that across the board, companies with large capitalization were
sold in favor of smaller companies.
   He said buyers were ``looking for low price-earnings multiples.''
   Companies holding land in Osaka and Nagoya, where land prices
have been rising, were popular issues, he said.
   ``The market is still watching interest rates. Yesterday, the
market was worried about an interest rate hike in West Germany, and
I think it is still concerned today,'' said Takeshi Yamamoto, head
of research at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities.
   He said shares of companies thought to have hidden assets, such
as warehousing firms and private railways, were doing well, while
retailers were still slumping following Tuesday's announcement by
Shuwa Corp. that it was selling its shares in the Life store chain.
   ``Supermarkets had been bought heavily on merger and acquisition
stories, led by Shuwa,'' which earlier this year made highly
publicized bids for smaller chains, Yamamoto said.

<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European foreign ministers have backed a $650
million package of aid for the struggling economies of Poland and
Hungary.
   ``The process of political and economic reform in Poland and
Hungary has progressed considerably,'' said the ministers of the
12-nation European Community.
   ``However, the process remains fragile and could be weakened by
economic difficulties,'' they said in a statement issued Tuesday at
the end of daylong talks on foreign policy issues.
   The aid package was unveiled last week as part of Western
efforts to help the Eastern European countries reform their
economies.
   British Foreign Secretary John Major said it was ``very
desirable'' to help the two countries, but said they must make
economic reforms to sustain their societies.
   The West wants to encourage the push in both countries for
broader economic and political reforms.
   In July, President Bush and heads of other leading democracies
asked the European Community to coordinate economic aid for Poland
and Hungary. They also urged emergency food shipments for Poland.
   At Tuesday's meeting, the foreign ministers endorsed a plan by
the European Commission, the trading bloc's executive body, to add
about $220 million to next year's budget to help the two countries.
   They also supported other elements of the plan, which included
agricultural aid, reducing trade restrictions, direct investment,
professional training and pollution control.
   Half of the $650 million cost of the plan would be paid for by
the community nations, and half would come from the other 12
nations including that United States that are taking part in the
drive.
   The foreign ministers also urged that higher-level officials of
the 24 nations meet soon ``to ensure that sufficient momentum is
maintained'' in the Poland-Hungary push.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland sent a letter in July to
community officials asking for 685,000 tons of beef, pork, powdered
milk, butter, oils, wheat, corn, rice and sugar in the coming
months.
   He also said Poland would need at least 3.7 million tons of food
next year and again in 1991.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $100 million libel trial of Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh is nearing its end after a
federal judge denied a defense motion to dismiss the case.
   Closing arguments were expected to begin this morning, said
Michael Nussbaum, one of Hersh's attorneys.
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Charles Norgle denied a request
to drop the case brought by former Indian Prime Minister Morarji
Desai. The judge ruled that Desai's attorneys had presented enough
evidence to allow the six-member jury to decide the case.
   Desai contends Hersh, 52, libeled him in his 1983 book on former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, ``The Price of Power.'' Hersh
wrote that Desai was a paid informant for the CIA and a valuable
``asset'' to the U.S. government during the Johnson and Nixon
administrations.
   To prove libel, Desai's attorneys must convince the jury that
Hersh knowingly printed false, negligent or malicious material
about Desai.
   Desai, 94, is seeking $100 million in damages. He is too ill to
attend the trial, however. Videotaped excerpts from his 81-hour
deposition were shown to the jury.
   Hersh testified that six ``high level'' U.S. government sources
told him Desai was a CIA asset.
   Kissinger testified Monday that he didn't believe Desai was a
CIA informant. But under cross-examination by Hersh's attorneys, he
acknowledged he couldn't be sure of that because he wasn't told the
names of the agency's informants.
   Hersh won his Pulitzer for international reporting in 1970 for
his coverage of the My Lai massacre in Vietnam.
   Desai, a bitter political rival of the late Indian Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi, headed the country's government from 1977
to 1979.
   In his book, Hersh contends that Desai supplied information to
the United States because he opposed Mrs. Gandhi's policy of
maintaining close ties with the Soviet Union and plans for the 1971
invasion of Pakistan.

   A second type of deadly AIDS virus has
reached the West Coast, where it was found in a West African man
who often failed to wear condoms when he had sex with 20 to 40
women here since 1979, officials say.
   ``This is the first case of HIV-2 to our knowledge in the
western United States,'' said Dr. David Ho, director of the AIDS
virology laboratory at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   HIV-2 _ or human immunodeficiency virus type 2 _ is common in
West Africa, but very rare in the United States, where almost all
of more than 105,000 AIDS cases were caused by the HIV-1 type.
   The infected man, a Los Angeles resident who moved here from
Sierra Leone in 1979, hasn't developed AIDS, and chances are low
that he infected his lovers, said Dr. Peter Kerndt, AIDS
epidemiology director at Los Angeles County's Department of Health
Services.
   Until now, only seven cases of HIV-2 infection had been
confirmed in the United States: three in Massachusetts and one each
in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Florida and New Jersey, said Dr.
Thomas O'Brien, an epidemiologist at the national Centers for
Disease Control. Three of those people developed AIDS.
   Six other people believed to be infected with HIV-2 have been
identified in New York state, including five in New York City,
O'Brien said by phone from Atlanta. Almost all the patients
imported the virus from West Africa, he said.
   Kerndt said the HIV-2-infected Los Angeles man had 20 to 40
sexual contacts since moving here. But Kerndt and Ho said the
possibility the man infected his partners is relatively low because
he has low levels of HIV-2 in his bloodstream.
   The man, whose identity was withheld, ``had multiple unprotected
sexual contacts over a long period of time'' with one woman, Kerndt
said. Yet she has been tested and is not infected with the virus.
``That is reassuring,'' Kerndt said.
   A second woman also is uninfected, but officials expect to
locate only two or three more of the women, Kerndt said.
   The man is in his 30s, works full-time and attends school
part-time. He has refrained from sex since learning three months
ago he might be infected with HIV-2, Ho said.
   ``This man is a pretty decent person,'' he added. ``He's had a
couple of traceable contacts and they are negative (AIDS-free). But
he had multiple other non-traceable contacts _ one-night stands.
He's fully cooperative, but he doesn't know these other women he
had casual sex with. ... He used condoms occasionally, but on other
occasions he didn't.''
   A private doctor referred the man to Cedars-Sinai for AIDS
testing, but he wasn't hospitalized, Ho said.
   HIV-2 was first described in 1985 in West African prostitutes
who had no symptoms, then reported in 1986 in two West Africans who
suffered AIDS, O'Brien said. HIV-1 and HIV-2 both can cripple the
body's ability to fight disease, leading to fatal infections and
cancers.
   O'Brien said that just because the second type of AIDS virus is
appearing in the United States ``doesn't mean there is going to be
a second epidemic. HIV-2 is very rare in this country and probably
will remain so in relation to HIV-1.''
   Kerndt said the infected Los Angeles resident never donated
blood, ``has not used drugs intravenously, nor has he engaged in
any homosexual activity.''

<TEXT>
   A powerful bomb exploded in a congested
shopping district of the capital today, killing five people and
injuring 13, police said. Two of the dead were young sisters.
   The blast that rocked the Sadar Bazaar in northern New Delhi
apparently stemmed from a land feud that has been simmering between
two families for more than a quarter century, residents said.
   Four of the victims belonged to the family of Abdul Razak, the
65-year-old operator of a motor scooter stand who owns the land.
   His wife, sister and two granddaughters, ages 4 and 8, died in
the blast. The other victim was not immediately identified, but
authorities said he was probably a customer.
   Meedan Bee, the mother of the two children, beat her chest as
she repeatedly cried: ``Allah, I lifted the bodies of my two
daughters with my own hands. One didn't even have a face.''
   The bomb was concealed in a plastic container, wrapped in cloth
and hidden under a wooden canopy where Razak's relatives were
sitting, police said. It exploded at about 10:05 a.m., they said.
   ``It was terrible. I saw ears, limbs and necks strewn around,''
said Satish Saxena, a local politician who went to inspect the
scene.
   A blood-soaked plastic doll that was partially burned lay at the
end of the parking lot. A canvas thatch over the scooter stand had
come down. The wooden canopy, shattered into pieces, was black.
   A sobbing Razak said the land dispute probably triggered the
blast. He said a neighboring shopkeeper has been trying to occupy
the land and that the feud has been in court for 25 to 30 years.
   Police could not confirm the allegation. But a senior official
said, ``We are investigating all angles.''
   Today's explosion was the second to rock the capital in four
months.
   A powerful bomb exploded in the capital's main railroad station
in June, killing eight people and injuring 53. Police blamed Sikh
militants demanding a separate homeland in northern Punjab state.

<TEXT>
   Three black men convicted in
separate murder cases were hanged today at Pretoria Central Prison,
raising to 42 the number of executions in South Africa so far this
year.
   None of the killings had been depicted as having political
overtones, although anti-apartheid activists and human rights
lawyers have been campaigning for a moratorium on all executions.
   Two mixed-race men were hanged on Friday, the first executions
since mid-July and the first approved by President F.W. de Klerk
during his seven weeks in power. One of them, Mangena Jeffrey
Boesman, was a member of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement, and was hanged despite a clemency appeal from
the United Nations.
   Two of the prisoners hanged this year were white, the rest black
or mixed-race. The number of executions is far lower than in
previous years, such as 1987, when a record 164 people were
executed.
   The government says 54 condemned prisoners have received
reprieves this year. More than 200 prisoners, nearly all of them
black men, remain on Death Row.

<HEAD>Ex-Navy Flier Under Investigation, Says He's Not Involved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ex-Navy flier is under investigation in
the bombing of a van driven by the wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers
III, but said he isn't responsible for act, the Los Angeles Times
reported today.
   ``I didn't do it and I don't know who did it,'' said H. George
Marxmiller a commercial pilot for Eastern Airlines who now lives in
Lake Oconee, Ga. ``But they suspect I know who did it. (Yet) to
think I would do something like this is utter nonsense. It's so out
of character. It doesn't compute.''
   The interview was conducted earlier this week in Georgia, the
newspaper said.
   As skipper of the USS Vincennes, Rogers gave the July 1988 order
to shoot down what turned out to be an Iranian jetliner. All 290
people aboard the plane were killed.
   Rogers later was exonerated on grounds he had reason to believe
his ship was under attack as it patrolled the Persian Gulf during
the Iran-Iraq War.
   Investigators originally believed the March 10 bombing of
Rogers' van in San Diego was done by terrorists in retaliation for
the attack.
   Roger's wife, Sharon, narrowly escaped injury when the pipe
planted in the van exploded at a busy intersection.
   Federal investigators changed their thinking on the case when
Marxmiller's name emerged, the Times said.
   It reported that multiple sources had confirmed that Marxmiller
is now the leading individual under investigation in the case.
   The special agent in charge of the FBI in San Diego has refused
to comment on the investigation.
   Marxmiller and Rogers said they had met only once, several years
ago, and that they had not seen each other since.
   ``I dimly remember the guy,'' Rogers said. ``I have no idea why
he would be involved in this thing. And I have no other comment.''
   Marxmiller adamantly denied having a personal vendetta against
Rogers or a desire to hurt him or his family. ``I don't have
anything against the guy,'' he said.
   Marxmiller said he had taken two polygraph tests since the
summer and was asked whether he was involved in the bombing.
   Marxmiller said he believed he failed a question in the second
test about whether he had planned the bombing or knew who placed
the bomb under the van.
   He said the FBI also has asked for his fingerprints and a
photograph and has interviewed his brother extensively about their
whereabouts around the time of the bombing.
   FBI officials also seemed interested in the fact that Rogers'
name is among three dozen people listed as witnesses on behalf of
Marxmiller's wife, Rebecca, who is suing for divorce in Georgia,
according to the newspaper.
   Neither H. George Marxmiller nor Rogers could explain why
Rogers' name was listed as a witness.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze is in Nicaragua for talks, but an official report said
he and President Daniel Ortega would not discuss Soviet aid to the
leftist government.
   Shevardnadze arrived Tuesday for the 24-hour visit, saying he
brought a message for Ortega from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and the Soviet leadership. He did not immediately disclose its
contents.
   ``We attribute great importance to these conversations ... in
Managua, at such a transcendental stage when a new era, a peaceful
era for the Nicaraguan revolution is to begin,'' Shevardnadze said.
   ``We support it, and the Soviet Union would like to contribute
to this historic cause.''
   Shevardnadze, the highest-ranking Soviet official to visit
Nicaragua, was scheduled to meet today with Ortega and the
leadership of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, which
seized power in a 1979 revolution from rightist President Anastasio
Somoza.
   Barricada, the Sandinista newspaper, quoted a government
official as saying Shevardnadze's visit would be ``strictly
political.''
   ``The topics of bilateral cooperation will be broached in
November,'' when a Nicaraguan-Soviet economic meeting is scheduled,
Barricada said.
   The newspaper listed Soviet aid to Nicaragua at $11.2 billion
from 1980 to 1988. According to U.S. government figures, the Soviet
Union has been giving Nicaragua $1 billion a year, half of it in
military aid.
   The Soviet Union also provides about 40 percent of Nicaragua's
annual consumption of 760,000 tons of petroleum and Soviet bloc
countries provide the rest. Mexico and Venezuela quit supplying the
leftist Sandinista government with oil in 1981 because of
non-payment.
   Shevardnadze is expected to discuss Nicaragua's general
elections set for Feb. 25.
   In August, Ortega moved up the date of the 1991 elections and
promised a free press and open and honest balloting.
   In return, he and other Central American presidents agreed to
disband the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, by December and
to quit allowing them to operate from neighboring countries.
   Observers from the United Nations, the Organization of American
States, the European Parliament and a delegation led by former
President Carter will monitor the elections.

<TEXT>
   A small dog facing a ``death penalty'' for
biting a man has been released after a judge ruled that even
canines have constitutional rights.
   Marion County Circuit Judge Richard D. Barber ruled Tuesday that
the dachshund terrier named Blue Two should go free after spending
75 days at the Humane Society of Willamette Valley.
   Barber said the county has a right to confiscate a dog in the
interest of public safety but that right ``cannot be exercised with
total disregard of what we consider to be due process of law.''
   Bob Cannon, the county's legal counsel, predicted the ruling
will prevent the county from enforcing state law in all future
dog-bite cases.
   But the defense attorney for the dog's owners said the decision
shows that county animal control ordinances need to be changed.
   ``Blue Two obviously was not one of those dangerous dogs,'' said
attorney Walter Todd, who represents Vic and Karen Parkison.
   Karen Parkison greeted her pet with tears in her eyes. She said
the dog had turned gray and lost weight.
   ``I'm just happy and relieved to have him,'' she said, adding it
was ``75 long, long days of waiting.''
   The dog had bitten a man July 13. The victim said he did not
want the dog put to death, but the county proceeded with a hearing.

Paper</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dr. David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize winner who
helped write a research paper that has been challenged as
fraudulent, has been offered the presidency of Rockefeller
University.
   Some ``very strong members of the faculty'' criticized the
choice, said Richard M. Furlaud, a co-chairman of a committee of
Rockefeller University trustees that searched for a new president.
   Baltimore, a 51-year-old molecular biologist who shared the 1975
Nobel Prize in medicine for cancer research, has not been accused
of wrongdoing in the paper.
   He would succeed Dr. Joshua Lederberg as head of the graduate
university, which specializes in biomedical research and training.
Lederberg will turn 65 years old, the mandatory retirement age, in
May.
   The National Institutes of Health and the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations were investigating charges that a
paper signed by Baltimore and five other authors was not supported
by the data.
   The research was done in a Massachusetts Institute of Technology
laboratory and not by Baltimore.
   Since 1982, Baltimore has directed the Whitehead Institute for
Biomedical Research, a private group in Cambridge, Mass.,
affiliated with MIT.
   ``We have looked very carefully into the whole NIH investigation
and the report of error in the paper, and we are absolutely
convinced that as far as he is concerned, there is not a scintilla
of evidence of fraud, misconduct or anything else,'' Furlaud said.
   Baltimore said he planned to meet today with faculty members and
planned several more visits in coming weeks. However, he said
topics of discussion probably would not include the paper but
rather ``where Rockefeller is going to go, what the needs of the
university for science are for the next decade and whether they
feel I can lead the institution in the right directions.''
   He said he had not decided whether to accept the position.

   More than 8,000 people proclaiming
themselves the voice of the unborn rallied at the Capitol after a
legislator introduced a measure that would impose broad
restrictions on abortion in Pennsylvania.
   ``I was told last week it was a Catholic issue. I was told last
week it was a women's issue. I was told last week it was a
Bible-belt issue,'' state Rep. Gerard Kosinski told the crowd,
referring to a smaller rally by pro-choice activists a week earlier.
   ``The bottom line is it's a human issue.''
   Earlier Tuesday, Rep. Stephen Freind unveiled a bill designed to
challenge the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Roe vs. Wade ruling that gave
women the right to abortion.
   Among other things, it would require a 24-hour waiting period
before an abortion; ban all abortions after the 24th week of
pregnancy except to save the woman's life; ban abortions used for
choosing the sex of a child; and require that a husband be notified
before a woman has an abortion in most cases.
   Freind's bill, backed by Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey, could
be the first to be adopted in the nation since the high court in
July endorsed Missouri's right to put more modest restrictions on
abortions.
   At a news conference, Freind said the bill could give the
Supreme Court a chance to overturn Roe.
   Later, the Republican lawmaker was cheered at the rally by about
8,500 people, including activists from New York, New Jersey,
Virginia and Maryland. They held signs saying ``The unborn need
freedom too,'' and ``Pro choice means pro murder,'' and closed the
rally by launching red, white and blue balloons.
   Maggie D'Alesio, a Philadelphia nurse who said she witnessed the
death of an aborted fetus that lived for 90 minutes after the
operation, said one person can make a difference.
   ``These unborn babies have no one but us to cry out for them,''
she said. ``Let us make sure we are heard.''
   Freind's bill has the support of more than 70 co-sponsors, some
of whom joined him at the news conference and rally. He said he
expected his proposal to pass the General Assembly and move to the
governor by early next month.
   Also Tuesday, abortion rights advocates formally introduced
their legislative package. It includes a proposed constitutional
amendment outlining a woman's right to have an abortion.
   The package also would restore government funding for poor women
who have ``medically necessary'' abortions, and weaken a state law
requiring parental notification or a court order before a minor can
obtain an abortion. That provision is not in effect because it is
being reviewed by a court.
   In Madison, Wis., a legislative committee recommended approval
of a measure to repeal an obsolete Wisconsin law establishing
prison penalties for women who have abortions and doctors who
perform them.
   On the other side of the issue, Florida Gov. Bob Martinez on
Tuesday proposed criminal penalties for individuals who operate
abortion clinics without a license. He also wants to give the state
health department authority to close and fine clinics that are not
in compliance.

   Actor William Hurt expressed thanks after a
judge ruled against his ex-lover, who claimed half of his wealth as
his common-law wife. But her attorney vowed an appeal, saying the
female judge was ``madly in love'' with Hurt.
   Tuesday's ruling was ``a vindication of everything I have
said,'' the 39-year-old Oscar-winning actor said in a statement.
   He said he went to court because ``I felt that I simply could
not continually give in to the pressures that have been constantly
put on me for more and more money and other accommodations from
Sandra Jennings and others.''
   In an interview published today in The Middlesex (Mass.) News,
Jennings blasted Judge Jacqueline Silbermann, who issued the ruling.
   ``I think she was star-struck and I think she didn't use her
intelligence,'' said Jennings, a native of Framingham, Mass.
   Jennings, 32, based her lawsuit on four of the 10 weeks she
spent with Hurt in Beaufort, S.C., during the winter of 1982-83
while he was there filming ``The Big Chill,'' a hit movie about a
reunion of 1960s-era college chums.
   Common-law marriages were abolished in 1933 in New York state,
where Jennings and Hurt lived, but South Carolina is one of 13
states, along with the District of Columbia, that recognize such
unions.
   Silbermann, of the trial level state Supreme Court, ruled that
although Jennings lived with Hurt and had a child with him, living
together did not constitute a marriage.
   Jennings met Hurt in Saratoga in 1981 when he was a 31-year-old
rising star and she a 24-year-old dancer with the New York City
Ballet. Less than a year later, she was pregnant.
   The couple arrived in Beaufort on Oct. 31, 1982, and Jennings
contended that a common-law marriage existed between Dec. 9, when
Hurt learned Mary Beth Hurt had divorced him, and Jan. 10, when
Jennings and Hurt left the state.
   She said Hurt resisted formalizing the union, telling her they
had a ``spiritual'' marriage and were ``married in the eyes of
God.''
   Jennings' lawyer, A. Richard Golub, said he would immediately
appeal the decision, claiming Silbermann was ``madly in love'' with
Hurt.
   ``Let five judges who are all men decide this, not one woman who
is impressed by a movie star,'' Golub said.
   Silbermann last year presided over Golub's divorce from actress
Marisa Berenson, a settlement he has said he was happy with.
   Silbermann's ruling in the Hurt-Jennings case came about three
months after a two-week, non-jury trial that was punctuated by
angry outbursts, and more than five years after Jennings walked out
on Hurt.
   In court and in impromptu corridor news conferences, Jennings
said Hurt was physically and emotionally abusive. She told
reporters Hurt had beaten her, spat on her and called her vulgar
names.
   Silbermann's decision did not deal with financial support for
Jennings and the couple's 6-year-old son, Alexander Devon Hurt.
Hurt pays $60,000 to $65,000 a year to Jennings and the boy. Before
the trial, he refused to increase the amount and Jennings
petitioned for $16,000 a month, which Silbermann rejected.
   Had the case gone in Jennings' favor, she would have been
entitled to a hearing and ruling on how much Hurt should give her
from his assets _ up to half of what he has earned since the time
they were together.
   In addition to ``The Big Chill,'' Hurt has starred in ``Body
Heat,'' ``Children of a Lesser God,'' ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,''
``Broadcast News'' and ``The Accidental Tourist.'' He won an Oscar
in 1986 for ``Spider Woman.''
   Last March, Hurt married Heidi Henderson, daughter of bandleader
Skitch Henderson. They had a son, Sam, in August.

   The dollar was lower in Europe this morning,
pressured by renewed rumors of central bank intervention in East
Asian markets. Gold prices rose.
   Traders said there were rumors that the Bank of Japan, Bank of
England and Deutsche Bundesbank sold dollars in several regional
East Asian markets.
   The rumored central bank intervention was the only thing that
was preventing the U.S. currency from going higher, dealers said.
   Traders said investors were prepared to sit out today and part
of the Thursday trading session waiting for the outcome of the West
German central bank's Thursday policy-setting meeting.
   Many traders were expecting the central bank to increase
interest rates.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.05 yen to a closing 140.60 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 140.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8735 West German marks, down from 1.8865
   _1.6245 Swiss francs, down from 1.6350
   _6.3580 French francs, down from 6.4005
   _2.1201 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1195
   _1,371.75 Italian lire, down from 1,380.50
   _1.1750 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1763
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6100 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6055 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $365.95 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $365.50. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $366.05.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $366.10 compared with $365.25 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed unchanged at $366.50.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.23 a troy
ounce, up from Tuesday's $5.22.

   New state rules requiring donors to sperm
banks to undergo two AIDS tests and barring homsexual men and
intravenous drug users from donating were welcomed by the director
of one bank.
   ``In order to minimize the risks of transmission and increase
the safety to recipients, we have to get some controls over who the
sperm donors are,'' said Dr. Grace Centola, who runs a sperm bank
at the University of Rochester Medical Center.
   The first question asked by patients seeking sperm from an
anonymous donor is invariably about the danger of contracting
acquired immune deficiency syndrom, she said Tuesday.
   The regulations that took effect Monday also require for the
first time that sperm banks be licensed by the state.
   Donors are required to undergo two separate AIDS tests, the
second one six months after the sperm has been donated and frozen,
said Mary Anne Gardineer, Health Department associate director for
regulatory affairs.
   The regulations exclude a person from donating if he's had any
homosexual activity, intravenous drug use or sex with a person
thought to be at high risk for AIDS since 1977.
   The same people already are barred from donating blood,
Gardineer said.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control have documented no cases of
transmission of the AIDS virus through donated sperm in the United
States, a spokesman said.
   Gardineer said there's been one case of an Australian man who
tested positive for the AIDS virus after donating sperm to eight
women. Four of the women later tested positive for the virus, but
three of their babies born through artificial insemination were
healthy, Gardineer said. The fourth pregnancy never came to term.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
most often through sex, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   New York state's 25,000 confirmed AIDS cases is about
one-quarter of the nation's total.
   Geoffrey Knox, a spokesman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, said
he had no problem with the prohibition against homosexual men.
   In 1987, about 30,000 women in the United States were
impregnated through the use of anonymous donor sperm, Centola said.
   Gardineer couldn't be sure of just how many sperm banks there
are in the state because they haven't been licensed in the past.
   The new rules don't apply in cases where a person is donating
sperm for a specific person, such as his wife.

   City Clerk Pam Ferris got the surprise
of her life when the man at the microphone at the City Council
meeting asked for her hand in marriage.
   Lou Droesch, a mortgage broker, walked to the microphone as
Tuesday night's meeting neared its end.
   ``I'm crazy about your city clerk,'' Droesch told the council.
``And I ask that the city fathers approve my asking for her hand in
marriage.''
   Mayor Herm Fauson knew about the proposal and rescheduled an
executive session so the proposal could be made.
   Before giving his approval, Fauson said, ``One of the conditions
that we might ask that you include in the proposal is that you
don't try to take her away from the city.''
   Droesch agreed and promptly got down on one knee and asked
Ferris to marry him. She accepted.
   Droesch, who lives just outside town, said he will leave the
time and place to Ferris.
   ``First I thought he was going to ask to be annexed to
Louisville,'' Ferris said, who had no prior knowledge of the
proposal.
   The couple and the council celebrated with champagne after the
meeting was adjourned.

<HEAD>Snow in Western Mountains; Windy, Cool in Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Windy and unseasonably cool weather persisted in the Northeast
today, while light snow was expected on top of at least 6 inches
that covered mountain passes in Idaho and Montana.
   Early morning temperatures were in the 30s and 40s from New
England to Pennsylvania and across the Great Lakes to the northern
Plains.
   Gale warnings were in effect today for Lake Ontario and
small-craft advisories were posted along the Atlantic coast. Clouds
covered much of the Northeast, with showers likely and snow showers
possible in higher elevations.
   In the West, Monida Pass along the Montana-Idaho border reported
6 inches of snow at mid-afternoon Tuesday, and West Yellowstone,
Mont., reported a cover of five inches. Light snow continued
falling into the night.
   The upper-level weather disturbance responsible for the snow
also produced strong winds across parts of Arizona and Nevada, with
gusts as high as 38 mph at Kingman and Winslow, Ariz., Tuesday
afternoon.
   Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms extended from southern
Arizona across northern New Mexico into Colorado Tuesday evening,
and it rained this morning in lower elevations in Montana.
   It was cloudy this morning across much of the Plateau and Rocky
Mountain region into the northern and central High Plains.
   Fair skies prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   Tuesday's high temperature in the Lower 48 states was 98 degrees
at Presidio, Texas, while Miami, at 92, tied a record high set in
1977.

<HEAD>Men Fail to Open Bank Safe, Getaway Car Crashes; Suspect Captured</HEAD>

   Three men with an M-16 rifle, a
grenade, a pistol and a knife robbed a bank, but police captured
one suspect after he rammed a stolen car into several other
vehicles, authorities said today.
   Lt. Col. Supavith Chuunak said the three entered a branch of the
Thai Farmers Bank at midday Tuesday shouting ``This is a robbery''
and firing warning shots.
   Supavith said the robbers tried to open the bank safe but
failed. They fled the bank with $4,000 from the bank counter and
customers.
   According to the police account, one man ran from the bank
wielding the M-16 and tried to steal a car outside the bank.
   The car owner fought the man, wresting away the M-16 before the
suspect drove off with the car.
   About a half mile from the scene, the car crashed into at least
four cars and stalled. The suspect tried to run away, but
passers-by, thinking he was trying to flee the scene of an
accident, grabbed and held him police arrived.
   The other suspects remained at large.

   About 500 students, angry at what they said were
racist remarks by a history teacher, rampaged at their high school
and forced the administration to close it early, police said.
   One police officer was injured and four students were charged
with disorderly conduct Tuesday after the incident at Eastern
District High School in Brooklyn.
   About 100 police officers were summoned to help send students
home when more than 1,000 students milled in front of the building
after officials closed it.
   A policewoman was hit in the head with a thrown bottle and
slightly injured, police said.
   ``They were kids and they were a little hot under the collar,
but by and large, they were an easy group to deal with,'' Deputy
Chief Thomas Gallagher said.
   Nick Gonzalez, 16, David Turpin, 16, Deshane Smart, 18, and a
15-year-old student whose identity was not released because of his
age were charged with disorderly conduct, Gallagher said. Smart
also was charged with resisting arrest.
   Damage in the school consisted of ``a couple of display cases
that were broken and a few fluorescent light bulbs that were
broken,'' Gallagher said.
   The students were angry over a remark allegedly made by Jeffrey
Goldstein, a white social-studies teacher.
   Noel Kriftcher, superintendent of Brooklyn and Staten Island
schools, said Goldstein told his class last Thursday that American
blacks, while concerned about racism in South Africa, were less
concerned about the plight of blacks in West African nations.
   ``Then he said something about blacks being backward in those
countries,'' Kriftcher said.
   The United Federation of Teachers released a statement by
Goldstein saying he lectured about atrocities committed by East
African dictators on blacks and that ``no students objected at the
time to the lesson.''
   Students said Goldstein used racial slurs when addressing
students. ``He always made racist remarks,'' said Nelta Cajigas, 17.
   About 75 percent of the school's 3,100 students are Hispanic and
22 percent are black, said Board of Education spokesman Frank
Sobrino.
   About 50 students met with the school's principal in the
auditorium Tuesday to voice their dissatisfaction. Eventually, the
group grew to about 500 students who began rampaging through
hallways breaking glass, Gallagher said.
   Schools Chancellor Bernard Mecklowitz toured the school and
directed that Goldstein be re-assigned to a district office pending
an investigation, Sobrino said.

   Eighteen East German refugees
have sought refugee at the U.S. Embassy in Communist East Berlin,
seeking passage to the West, a U.S. diplomatic source said today.
   ``They have been there since yesterday afternoon,'' said the
source at the U.S. Embassy in Bonn. ``There are 10 adults and eight
children.''
   The source spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of not
being further identified.
   West Germany's ZDF television network also reported that 18 East
Germans were in the U.S. Embassy, and that a solution was being
sought for the standoff.
   The Associated Press tried repeatedly to call the U.S. Embassy
in East Berlin, but was unable to get a telephone line through on
the country's overcrowded circuits.
   East Germany banned unrestricted travel to Czechoslovakia on
Tuesday after reluctantly agreeing for the second time in a week to
safe passage to the West for thousands of East German refugees who
had thronged at West Germany's embassy there.
   West Germany closed its diplomatic offices in East Berlin to the
public in mid-August after East Germans trying to get to the West
sought refugee there.

<HEAD>Falwell Says Bakker Wrong to Blame Him for PTL Troubles</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bakker Trial, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rev. Jerry Falwell said evangelist Jim Bakker
shouldn't blame him for the collapse of PTL because the damage to
the bankrupt ministry took place before he assumed control, a
newspaper reported.
   In an interview in today's editions of The Dallas Morning News,
Falwell said he met Bakker for the first time when the PTL founder
called him to Palm Springs, Calif., to turn over the ministry.
Bakker resigned in a sex-and-money scandal in 1987.
   ``I don't know a thing about the gentleman,'' Falwell said. ``I
thought he was a joke.''
   Falwell made the comments in response to Bakker's testimony at
his fraud trial in Charlotte, N.C., on Monday in which he accused
Falwell of cheating PTL followers.
   Bakker also said Falwell and his attorney, Norman Roy Grutman,
``threatened'' board members by telling them they ``might be liable
to a civil suit.''
   Falwell said that after he and his associates arrived at PTL and
realized the situation, Grutman told the PTL's board of directors
``they had best get directly involved because they had personal
civil responsibilities.''
   Falwell said he never met any of the PTL directors. But he said
he called in Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., the accounting and management
consulting firm, brought in attorneys and appointed ``a blue-ribbon
panel'' of directors from across the country.
   ``I told them to conceal nothing, to tell the truth, to release
all financial papers to the press and to immediately expose any
inequities or illegal activity,'' Falwell said. ``And they did it.''
   Bakker is accused of plotting to swindle followers out of $158
million and of using at least $3.7 million to support a lavish
lifestyle. The ministry has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection from creditors.
   Falwell, an evangelist from Lynchburg, Va., was in Dallas for a
speaking engagement Wednesday.

   A gunman ambushed and killed the leader
of Belgium's Jewish community, and authorities today were
investigating whether the attack was anti-Semitic.
   Israel's ambassador to Belgium speculated that neo-Nazis were
behind the shooting of Dr. Joseph Wybran Tuesday evening.
   ``This was a terrorist attack. There is no doubt about that,''
said a police official on condition of anonymity. He did not
elaborate.
   Wybran, 49, was shot in the head as he got into his car outside
Brussels University Hospital, where he headed the immunology
department, police said. A hospital spokesman said he died early
today.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the slaying.
   ``It is impossible to determine the precise motive,'' for the
shooting, Michael Peytier, a spokesman for the Brussels
prosecutor's office, told reporters. ``But given the nature of his
(Wybran's) activities, it cannot be excluded that this was a
political attack.''
   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, in a statement, called the act
``revolting and wretched'' and expressed his ``indignation at
violence and intolerance.''
   In addition to heading the country' Jewish community, Wybran
chaired of the Belgian Auschwitz Committee. The committee recently
urged Poland's Roman Catholic primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, to
remove an order of Carmelite nuns from a convent on the perimeter
of the former Auschwitz death camp in Poland.
   Wybran had recently returned from Poland, where he urged
authorities to publicly oppose racism and anti-Semitism.
   Jewish leaders complained the convent and its religious symbols
were offensive at a site where 2.5 million Jews were killed as part
of Adolf Hitler's campaign to exterminate European Jews during
World War II.
   Police said they have found no witnesses to the attack.
   Israel's ambassador to Belgium, Avi Primor, told Israeli army
radio he has been in touch with authorities to discuss the attack
and security for embassy staff and Jews in Belgium.
   He speculated that among those behind the shooting were
neo-Nazis.
   ``These of course have a lot of reason to be angry with
Professor Wybran,'' Primor said. ``He was one of the initiators of
the campaign to remove the Carmelite monastery from Auschwitz.''
   Police said Wybran was apparently ambushed by a gunman from
behind Wybran's car in the hospital parking lot. He had been on his
way to a ceremony at the university's Martin Buber Institute, a
Jewish Studies school.
   In December, Wybran became head of the Coordinating Committee of
Jewish Organizations in Belgium, which represents about 30,000 Jews
from 30 different groups. Until last year, he was head of the
Brussels chapter of B'nai B'rith, the Jewish charity and social
organization.
   There have been several anti-Semitic attacks in Belgium in
recent years. In July 1980, a grenade exploded as 50 Jewish
teen-agers were about to take a bus to summer camp. One teen-ager
died.
   On Oct. 20, 1981, two people died when a van packed with
explosives blew up outside an Antwerp synagogue. On Sept. 18, 1982,
four people were injured when gunmen sprayed a Brussels synagogue
with automatic gunfire.

<TEXT>
   The Cabinet today endorsed the ban on
burying Ferdinand Marcos' body in the Philippines after the defense
chief briefed them on an alleged plot to assassinate President
Corazon Aquino, officials said.
   Presidential spokesman Adolfo Azcuna said the ``sensitive
information'' on reputed security threats to the government was
discussed during the Cabinet session, but he refused to elaborate.
   Economic Planning Secretary Jesus Estanislao said, however, that
Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos briefed members on the security risks
facing the government if Mrs. Aquino allowed the body of the former
president to be buried in the Philippines.
   Marcos, 72, died in Honolulu Thursday. He had lived in exile in
Hawaii since he was toppled in a civilian-military uprising that
propelled Mrs. Aquino to power in February 1986.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow the body to be brought back to
the Philippines for burial and also forbade the late president's
widow, Imelda, and their three children to come back.
   ``There are destabilization threats,'' Estanislao told The
Associated Press. ``He (Ramos) presented intelligence reports,
including the possible assassination of the president.''
   Estanislao would not say whether Ramos provided details of any
alleged plot, nor whether the defense chief identified those who
allegedly were behind it.
   ``One thing you must realize is that there are parties abroad
who are very interested in destabilization, including Mrs.
Marcos,'' he said. ``And there are parties here who are interested
in destabilization. These two parties can act together.''
   In a news conference after the Cabinet meeting, Ramos refused to
confirm or deny Estanislao's disclosure, saying what was taken up
during the briefing was ``highly classified.''
   ``We are still trying to measure if this is an empty threat or
not,'' Ramos added. ``We cannot afford this kind of hysteria
because we are trying to attract investments in the country.''
   Marcos' followers have been linked to several of the six armed
attempts to topple Mrs. Aquino. But since Marcos' death,
demonstrations by his followers have been relatively small and
peaceful.
   Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said the Cabinet was
unanimous in its support for the controversial decision, despite
growing public pressure to allow Marcos' remains to come home.
   ``We have supported the president since the beginning on her
stand,'' Dominguez said. ``There is no question in the Cabinet as
to the position we are taking.''
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court agreed to consider a petition from
Marcos' supporters to overturn the ban and gave the government 10
days to respond.
   Mrs. Aquino says she will abide by the court's decision but
claims Marcos' burial in the Philippines could lead to civil unrest
and discourage foreign investment.
   Mrs. Marcos has been prohibited from leaving the United States,
where she is to be tried in New York in March on charges of
embezzling government money and investing some of it in the United
States. The Marcoses were indicted in October and Mrs. Marcos is
free on $5 million bond.

   A woman who had been acting strangely
for months fatally stabbed her two young daughters, then died after
ordering her 8-year-old son to stab her with the same kitchen
knife, police said.
   A state social worker interviewed each family member last month
after Marie King's husband, Christopher, said she threatened to
poison the children, Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services spokesman Ruben Betancourt said.
   The caseworker found no signs of child abuse and King refused
further intervention, saying he needed his wife at home to take
care of the children while he worked, Betancourt said.
   The attacks began Tuesday afternoon when Mrs. King, 32, became
enraged at her 3-year-old daughter, police said.
   ``The mother ... called the little girl, Sara, into the bedroom
and stabbed her, and then called her other little girl, the
4-year-old, Grace, into the bedroom, stabbed her, and they both
died on the scene,'' said Metro-Dade Police spokesman George Reyes.
   ``She then turned the knife over to her son ... and told him to
do to her what he had seen the mother do to the two little girls.''
   Reyes said the boy, who was shivering in fear when police
arrived later, initially refused his mother's command.
   ``Then, when he was admonished by his mother and told to do as
he was told, he complied, and he stabbed his mother to death in the
same bedroom that the two little girls were killed in,'' Reyes said.
   The 8-year-old then dialed 911. Police and firefighters who
arrived at the house north of Miami found the three bodies.
   Mrs. King had exhibited unusual behavior toward her family for
several months, police said.
   A 6-year-old son also was in the home during the stabbings, but
the father was not at home, police said.
   The boys and their father were taken to police headquarters for
questioning. Reyes said no charges would be filed against the
8-year-old.
   ``Unfortunately, he did something that his mother told him to
do, as any boy would do,'' Reyes said. ``He responded as his mother
told him to respond ... and obviously it just hit him that he had
done maybe something wrong.''

   Here is a chronology of the exodus of
East Germans to the West.
   Sept. 10 _ Budapest announces that all East Germans vacationing
in Hungary can go to the West across its border with Austria if
they choose to do so. More than 12,000 East Germans take advantage
of the newly opened passage during the first two days. The number
jumps to more than 25,000 in less than a month.
   Sept. 11 _ East Germany denounces Hungary's action as
``illegal'' and charges that its Warsaw Pact ally ``under the guise
of humanitarianism is engaging in organized smuggling of humans.''
East Germany also alleges that West Germany is luring its citizens
away.
   Sept. 13 _ Hungary says it will keep the channel to the West
open. Meanwhile, East Germans visiting Czechoslovakia and Poland
have been flocking to Bonn's embassies in Prague and Warsaw hoping
to join the exodus.

<TEXT>
   An explosion at a student hostel that
may have been caused by a gas leak killed one person and seriously
injured five others today, the Edinburgh Fire Brigade said.
   Assistant Divisional Officer Graham Stevenson said rescuers were
still searching for one person who was unaccounted for but faced
difficult problems ``because of the high concentration of gas in
the area.''
   The inside of the five-story stone building in central Edinburgh
collapsed in the 7:30 a.m. explosion, but the roof remained
hanging, held on by the two adjoining buildings, he said.
   Four people were taken to the hospital shortly after the
explosion with serious injuries and the fifth was rescued 3{ hours
later, he said. The body of the unidentified victim was then
removed, he said.
   Deputy Fire Master Colin Cranston said rescuers were using their
hands and heat-seeking cameras rather than heavy equipment for fear
the roof and the exterior of the building would collapse on them.
   He said the rescue effort was ``very risky'' and could take
several hours.
   Stevenson said ``there is a report of other people in the
building,'' but when asked how many said ``we've no idea, really.''
   Neighboring buildings were evacuated and the area sealed off by
police. Passers-by were being warned not to light matches or smoke
cigarettes which could ignite gas still in the air.

<HEAD>Philippine Consul Raises Possibility of Marcos Viewing at Consulate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philippines' consul general here has offered
to allow Ferdinand Marcos' body to lie in state at the consulate if
his widow makes the request in writing and Philippine President
Corazon Aquino consents.
   In an ironic twist, the body would lie in state in a room
dedicated to Mrs. Aquino's husband, whose 1983 assassination led to
Marcos' downfall in a 1986 uprising that lifted Mrs. Aquino to
power.
   Consul General Tomas ``Buddy'' Gomez made the offer Tuesday
after a shouting match on the consulate steps with Marcos
supporters angry because the Philippine flag was not lowered to
half-staff after the former Phillipine president died in exile here
at age 72.
   Gomez said he didn't order the flag lowered because he had no
instructions from Manila to do so.
   The request for a lying-in-state at the consulate was made by
Joe Lazo, president of the Friends of Marcos. He said the Marcos
family would agree to having Marcos' body in the pavilion named for
Marcos rival Benigno Aquino Jr.
   ``Joe, you put that in writing and have that signed by the
widow,'' Gomez responded, adding he would make a personal request
to Mrs. Aquino.
   Gomez also said he would allow Marcos to be buried temporarily
at the consulate if he had Philippine and local government approval.
   This would satisfy the family's wish not to have Marcos buried
in American soil since the consulate legally is an extension of the
Philippines, Gomez said.
   Aquino was gunned down in 1983 at the Manila airport as he
returned to the Philippines from self-imposed exile in the United
States. The slaying, which many Filipinos blamed on Marcos and his
supporters, galvanized the opposition.
   Plans are going ahead to have Marcos' body temporarily entombed
here in hopes the Philippine government eventually will allow him
to be buried in his homeland, a family spokesman said. Mrs. Aquino
has refused to allow Marcos' body to be returned to his homeland,
saying it could provoke unrest.
   The Philippines Supreme Court has agreed to consider a petition
from Marcos supporters to lift the ban.
   Marcos' body has been on display at the family's mansion in
Makiki Heights, overlooking Honolulu. Hundreds have visited to view
the body, which will be taken Friday to a Roman Catholic cathedral
for a funeral Mass.
   ``There's one point I want to make perfectly clear and that is,
the final resting place of my father is going to be Ilocos Norte,''
Marco's home province, said his son, Ferdinand ``Bong Bong'' Marcos
Jr.
   Entombing Marcos above ground would serve a symbolic purpose for
the family in that the former president would not be buried in U.S.
soil, said Gomez.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers from both parties are criticizing
President Bush for not offering U.S. military aid to an attempted
coup in Panama, but a Senate Republican said today the only
American option is ``to let things take their course.''
   ``Once again we have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,
and I think it's an outrage,'' Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said
Tuesday.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said U.S. intervention could
have made a difference in the attempted coup against Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   ``We have the absolute unilateral right to use force,''
DeConcini said.
   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said of the complaints: ``It's
very easy to be an armchair general.''
   ``The president finally has to think about our treaty
obligations, our personnel, our relations with other countries in
the Latin American hemisphere and the future of democracy in
Panama, which can flow only from the Panamanian people making
choices,'' he said today on the NBC ``Today'' program.
   Although the U.S. military forces in Panama were on alert,
American officials said they only observed the fighting Tuesday
between members of the Panama Defense forces, standing by to help
any Americans who might be in danger.
   Lugar, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged
continued economic and diplomatic pressure on Panama, saying the
coup attempt indicated growing discontent inside that country with
Noriega.
   ``I have no doubt that there are going to be further attempts,
there is going to be further pressure. This is not over by a long
shot,'' he said. ``We have only that choice _ to let things take
their course.''
   Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., also urged continued economic
pressure without force.
   ``To simply send in troops is not how democracy should be
restored in Panama,'' Torricelli, a member of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program.
``It will happen and will be done the right way without causing a
backlash against the United States.''
   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla., was
bitter after emerging from an hour-long classified CIA briefing
Tuesday on the coup attempt.
   ``Here you have brave people in Panama ... trying to rid
themselves of a drug dealer and a thug who's taken over their
country,'' Boren said.
   ``And for the United States, with all of our strength and force
and all of our belief in democracy, to stand by ... and do nothing
and allow these people to fail, personally I think is wrong.''
   Boren said he had been notified early Tuesday that the coup was
in progress and followed its progress throughout the day. He said
200 to 300 rebel troops had seized the Panamanian Defense Forces
headquarters compound with Noriega inside, and had the leader
``trapped and pinned down.''
   But later in the day, about 500 troops loyal to Noriega
surrounded the compound and freed him. The fate of those who led
the revolt was unclear.
   No American troops or citizens were involved, Boren said.
   ``I'm just sorry it didn't succeed. I'm sorry there was not some
way, apparently, for the United States to help make it succeed,''
Boren told reporters.
   He cited failures by the Reagan administration to use force to
help Eric Arturo Delvalle when he sought to remove Noriega from
power, and to help maintain order when Noriega later overrode
national elections to retain power for himself.
   Asked whether military force should have been used Tuesday,
Boren said:
   ``My personal view is that we should have, and we didn't. ... We
certainly knew at that moment where (Noriega) was. He was in a
physical location where perhaps he could have been served with that
warrant for his arrest.''
   Noriega has been indicted in the United States on drug charges.
   ``I think it's one thing for the United States to go into any
other country ... and try to impose its will from the outside,''
Boren said.
   ``It's quite another thing when the people of Panama have very
clearly spoken in their free elections, and overwhelmingly want to
rid themselves of this ... corrupt dictatorship. ... I don't think
it is improper at all for the United States then to offer a helping
hand to the Panamanian people.''

<HEAD>Japanese Cooperative, Ethiopians Win `Alternative Nobel Prize'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese housewives organization,
Ethiopian scientists and campaigners for tribal peoples today won
the Right Livelihood Award, sometimes called the Alternative Nobel
Prize.
   The Seikatsu Club Consumers Cooperative, started by a group of
housewives, was awarded the prestigious honorary prize, which
carries no cash award.
   Four others, Dr. Melaku Worede of Ethiopia, the British
organization Survival International, and Ethiopian doctors Aklilu
Lemma and Legesse Wolde-Yohannes, shared the $120,000 cash prize.
   The awards will be presented in the Swedish Parliament on Dec.
9, the day before the Nobel Prize ceremonies.
   Jacob von Uexkull, a Swedish-German national, sold his valuable
stamp collection and founded the prize 10 years ago to encourage
practical solutions to everyday problems.
   He said it was largely ``thanks to the work of Survival
International that we in the West no longer see Indians and
Aboriginals as a primitive remnant.''
   The laureate organization, with 5,000 members in 60 countries,
was cited for its ``success in fostering public awareness of the
importance of traditional people's knowledge for the future of
humanity, as models of sustainability and survival.''
   It works to assist tribal peoples worldwide and its aim is to
``secure the rights, livelihood and self-determination'' of tribal
peoples. Uexkull said one of its successes was that ``now at least
the World Bank pays lip service'' to respecting tribal people's
right when awarding loans.
   Lemma and Wolde-Yohannes of Ethiopia were cited for their
scientific work on the use of the entod plant to combat a chronic
and eventually fatal Third World disease, bilharzia, which afflicts
more than 200 million people in 74 countries. The disease is caused
by parasites that invade blood vessels.
   Worede, an agronomist and Ph.D. graduate from the University of
Nebraska, was recognized for his creation of the Plant Genetic
Resources Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   His work has included establishing ``Strategic Seeds Reserves''
of traditional seeds that can be released to farmers for planting
in times of drought when other seeds are unlikely to thrive, the
Right Livelihood Socity said.
   The Seikatsu Club Consumers' Cooperative was cited as ``the most
successful model of production and consumption in the
industrialized world, aiming to change society by promoting
self-managed and less wasteful lifestyles.''
   It traces its foundation to 1965 when a single Tokyo housewife
organized 200 women to buy 300 bottles of milk to reduce their
price.
   It now involves 170,000 families, or about half a million
people, and a business enterprise with a turnover of $287 million
that will not handle products detrimental to the members' health or
the environment, the Right Livelihood Organization said.
   The club has also entered Japanese politics, paving the way for
women in a traditionally male field, on a largely ecological,
anti-nuclear platform.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two gunmen fatally wounded a
man several yards from a primary school in north Belfast today, and
the Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the attack.
   The IRA statement to Belfast news media claimed the victim was a
top member of an unidentified Protestant paramilitary group.
   The man was walking along a park in the mixed Protestant-Roman
Catholic area when he was shot repeatedly in the head and chest and
collapsed in the street, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   He was not immediately identified.
   ``He was lying face down on the pavement, which was covered in
blood. I could feel a weak pulse, and then it faded away before the
ambulance arrived,'' said Maeve Boyle, a nurse who rushed to the
victim's aid.
   Alban McGuinness, a Belfast city councilman representing the
Social Democratic and Labor Party, the province's main Catholic
party, said:
   ``The fact that the shooting appears to have been carried out
before the horrified gaze of young children going to school speaks
volumes for the sick mentality of the murderers.''
   Twenty years of violence have claimed 2,758 lives in Northern
Ireland, 47 of them this year.
   The chief constable of the Royal Ulster force, meanwhile,
dismissed as ``nonsense'' a claim that a secret conspiracy existed
inside his force to counter government policies that are
objectionable to the province's Protestant majority.
   Hugh Annesley said in a statement Tuesday night that since he
took office in June, all officers of the 13,000-member force ``have
given me their unqualified loyalty and support.''
   He was reacting to a Belfast newspaper report that its deputy
editor talked with a man identifying himself as spokesman for ``the
Inner Circle,'' an alleged secret society inside the constabulary.
   The paper, the Irish News, said the unidentified man displayed
secret lists of Irish Republican Army suspects which could only
have come from intelligence agencies.
   The paper said the ``Inner Circle'' claimed to be dedicated to
``the removal'' of IRA suspects and the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement,
which went over the heads of Protestants to give the Irish Republic
a say in the running of Northern Ireland.
   Annesley said that despite his skepticism, he had asked for the
claim to be investigated by English detectives who have been called
in to conduct an independent inquiry into a series of recent leaks
of intelligence documents.
   The almost exclusively Catholic IRA is fighting to push the
British out of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, join it with
the Republic of Ireland and set up an all-Ireland socialist state.

   By a 17-vote margin, residents have
lifted a major barrier to plans to cut a $250 million highway
tunnel under the Berthoud Pass to this ski resort.
   The proposed, 4.1-mile tunnel would spare motorists from having
to drive the zigzag road over the breathtaking, 11,315-foot gap and
would cut 20 minutes off the 90-minute, 55-mile trip from Denver to
Winter Park.
   Residents voted 110-93 Tuesday against a measure that would have
prevented the city from extending its borrowing powers to the
tunnel building authority. More than a third of the town's 600
permanent residents are registered to vote.
   The Berthoud Tunnel Building Authority, created by the Town
Council, will now proceed with a $2 million study of the project
and its environmental impact. The authority can issue bonds to be
paid off with tolls.
   Proponents of the tunnel say many tourists are afraid to make
the drive over the pass. Supporters also argue it will spur
development by bringing more skiers to Winter Park, one of the
nation's largest ski resorts.
   Opponents say that the tunnel would disrupt the quiet lifestyle
that attracted many people to the area and that the price tag is
too high.

   The former disbursing officer on the USS
Tuscaloosa has disappeared along with $247,500 of the government's
money, the Navy says.
   Investigators are searching for the officer, Lt. j.g. Bradley
Scott Darr, 31, who has been declared a deserter, Navy spokesman
Cmdr. David Dillon said Tuesday.
   No charges have been filed against Darr, who is from North
Carolina but whose hometown wasn't immediately available, said
Dillon.
   A routine Navy audit last month revealed the discrepancy in the
accounts of the San Diego-based tank-landing ship, which has a crew
of 244, Dilon said. Darr already had been ordered to another post
when the audit was completed.
   Under the orders issued July 30, Darr was supposed to report to
the Naval Air Station in Sigonella, Italy, by Aug. 23, but he never
showed up and was declared a deserter on Sept. 22, the commander
said.
   As disbursing officer, Darr was the ship's banker. ``He's making
deposits, meeting the payroll and handling all the financial
transactions on the ship,'' Dillon said.

   Guerrillas claimed today that
they captured another key town in northwestern Cambodia during a
massive offensive launched as Vietnam withdrew the last of its
troops.
   Meanwhile, Cambodian government troops shelled two refugee camps
run by guerrillas just inside the Thai border, forcing the
evacuation of relief workers.
   Gen. Dien Del, acting commander of the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front, said his troops had captured the town of Kandoul
after two days of attacks and were still advancing on another, Svay
Chiek.
   ``Kandoul is a very big victory, we will for sure now take Svay
Chiek,'' he said.
   The towns were among the objectives the guerrilla group cited
Saturday when they announced a ``general offensive'' against the
pro-Hanoi government in Phnom Penh.
   Western sources in this border town, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they believed Kandoul, 10 miles from the Thai
frontier, had been taken.
   Dien Del also claimed his non-Communist guerrilla group, along
with its coalition allies, had taken two government positions in
the Ampil District of Oddar Meanchey Province.
   Western relief staff today were evacuated from Site 2 and Site 8
refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian frontier because of nearby
shelling, said a U.N. official in Bangkok. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Site 2, about 30 miles north of Aranyaprathet, has a population
of 140,000. It is the largest of the string of refugee camps on the
Thai frontier that shelter about 300,000 Cambodians.
   It is controlled by the National Liberation Front.
   Site 8, about 60 miles south of Site 2, is controlled by the
radical communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
   The relief worker said that as far as he knew, no shells had
fallen into either of the camps.
   The National Liberation Front, which claims to field more than
16,000 fighters, is loosely allied with the more powerful Khmer
Rouge and a group loyal to coalition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The Western sources said no government reinforcements had
apparently arrived along Highway 69, which runs parallel to the
Thai frontier. Towns along the highway have been the major target
of the guerrilla offensive, which began after the pledged
withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces from Cambodia.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978 and had fought the
guerrillas, says it withdrew the last of its troops last week.

   The South African ambassador has a few
questions for Americans, who he admits harbor ``a certain amount of
hostility and antagonism'' toward his country.
   Thousands of Americans are receiving letters from Ambassador
P.G.J. Koornhof, along with a questionnaire and a reprint of a
Reader's Digest article arguing against U.S. economic sanctions on
South Africa.
   ``What is your opinion of the South African government's reforms
to eliminate apartheid?'' is one of the 12 questions.
   Another one asks: ``In your opinion, will punitive U.S.
sanctions promote positive political change in South Africa?''
   Then there is this one: A recent editorial ``concluded that
sanctions against South Africa have increased U.S. dependence on
the Soviet Union for strategic minerals. Does this concern you?''
   ``This is routine activity for the press section,'' said Delarey
Van Tonder, the embassy's press and information counselor. ``We try
to keep our mailing list updated.''
   The questionnaire also asks respondents whether they would like
more information about South Africa, divided into four categories:
social, labor, business and political. ``We try to provide
objective and balanced information about our country'' when people
indicate an interest, Van Tonder said.
   South Africa and the United States ``share the ideals of
democracy and freedom,'' Koornhof's letter said, noting that both
are committed to a free market economic system.
   ``We have both confronted the bitter legacy of racism,
segregation and racial segregation in our societies. Like the
United States, we are working to correct the mistakes and
injustices of our past,'' the letter said.
   Several thousand letters have gone out in recent months to
academics, politicians, business people and public figures, he said.
   ``Your opinion is important to me, to my government and to South
Africans _ black and white _ who are striving to build a truly open
and democratic society in South Africa,'' Koornhof wrote.
   Koornhof noted that while he has ``not been surprised to find a
certain amount of hostility and antagonism toward South Africa'' he
has also found ``a considerable reservoir of good will.''
   The hostility is based ``upon the widely held misperception that
my government remains committed to preserving apartheid,'' he said.
``This is not true'' as evidenced by the abolition of more than 50
discriminatory measures since 1980, Koornhof said.
   The newly elected government of South Africa, headed by
President F.W. de Klerk, is advocating reform that would grant the
country's black majority more freedom but would stop short of
giving them the right to vote.
   Herman J. Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African
Affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday
that events in South Africa are sufficiently encouraging to
preclude additional U.S. economic sanctions ``at the present
time.'' But in a shift from the position of the Reagan
administration, Cohen did not rule out sanctions if additional
progress is not made by next June in bringing about power-sharing
talks between blacks and whites.
   ``If, after the next parliamentary session (next June) there is
very little to show for it,'' Cohen said, the administration will
consult with its foreign allies and with Congress about what
sanctions are appropriate.
   External and internal pressures are helping convince the South
African government that it must ``move beyond its current position
and accept fundamental change,'' he said.
   And in an admission never made by officials of the Reagan
administration, Cohen added that the sanctions imposed by Congress
in 1986 despite a veto by President Reagan ``have played a role in
stimulating new thinking within the white power structure.''

   Federal officials announced civil suits or
fines today against 11 cities where local authorities allegedly
allowed untreated toxic industrial wastes into public sewage
systems.
   The Justice Department lawsuits on behalf of the Environmental
Protection Agency were filed against nine cities, including
Detroit, Phoenix and San Antonio, Texas, charging violations of
federal water pollution laws.
   In addition, San Antonio and two other cities agreed to pay
fines totaling $349,000 as part of separate consent agreements
involving past violations that stemmed from the illegal discharges,
EPA officials said.
   The cases announced today involved lawsuits filed this week _
four of them today _ in federal courts in Massachusetts, Michigan,
Texas, Arizona, New York and Pennsylvania.
   The new actions brought to 61 cities in 21 states against which
either administrative penalties have been sought or civil suits
were filed this year because of improper releases of toxic
industrial wastes.
   So far, the cities have agreed to pay more than $2.1 million in
fines. The EPA is seeking another $1.9 million in penalties in the
two dozen cases that remain open, a figure that could increase once
proposed penalties are included from the latest round of lawsuits.
   Nearly two-thirds of the 61 cases were initiated during the past
two months. In some cases the actions were taken by the states
involved after violations surfaced during EPA inspections of
records, officials said.
   In the largest case, the EPA and Denver reached a settlement in
August in which city officials agreed to pay more than $1.1 million
in penalties for alleged violations of clean water laws in
connection with toxic discharges through the municipal sewage
treatment plant.
   ``These lawsuits and penalties ... are designed to send a
message to city and county officials,'' said EPA Administrator
William Reilly.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the lawsuits reflect the
Bush administration's ``determination not to sit idly by while our
waters continue to be befouled.''
   ``We simply cannot allow harmful pollutants to reach our rivers
and streams untreated. ... Local officials have a legal and moral
responsibility to those they represent and to other users of our
nation's waterways to make sure local industries abide by the
rules,'' Thornburgh said.
   The federal lawsuits and EPA administrative enforcement actions
allege that the cities failed to adequately identify the industrial
discharges, allowed discharges in some cases without proper
permits, didn't screen samples of the wastewater to determine if
industrial plants were in compliance, and failed to take action
against polluters violating the pre-treatment requirements.
   The EPA said more than 870 million pounds of toxic industrial
chemicals _ including cyanide, arsenic and hazardous heavy metals
such as cadmium and lead _ were dumped into public sewage treatment
plants in 1987, the latest year for which figures are available.
   These wastes combine with normal sewage and after treatment are
released into open waters. But the treatment for normal sewage
isn't enough for the toxic wastes, so federal law requires that if
such chemical wastes are to be released through the sewage system
they must first undergo pre-treatment at the industrial plant.
   But according to EPA estimates, as many as one-third of the
1,500 municipal sewage treatment facilities don't adequately
monitor such pre-treatment or take action against violators to
ensure that the toxic wastes undergo treatment before entering the
sewage system.
   Civil lawsuits were filed this week against Gloucester, Mass.;
Dunkirk, N.Y.; Easton and Punxsutawney, Pa.; Detroit; Beaumont, El
Paso, and San Antonio, Texas; and Phoenix, Ariz.
   The EPA said consent agreements for past violations also were
reached this week with Nacogdoches, Texas, $60,000 fine;
Bellefonte, Pa., $64,000 fine; and San Antonio, $225,000 fine.

   Negotiators broke a five-month deadlock and
agreed on a tentative contract early today, averting a strike by
43,000 workers at more than 60 not-for-profit hospitals and nursing
homes in the New York City area.
   Representatives of Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health
Care Employees Union said they expected the rank and file to ratify
the three-year contract Thursday.
   The union represents some of the lowest-paid workers in the
health industry _ nurses' aides, laboratory technicians, X-ray
technicians, orderlies, clerks and social workers. Weekly wages are
generally $300 to $400.
   The contract would grant raises of 7.5 percent the first and
second years and 5 percent plus a $500 bonus the third year, said
Dennis Rivera, union president. Employees also won a 3 percent
boost in medical benefits, he said.
   William J. Abelow, president of the League of Voluntary
Hospitals, called the contract ``generous, expensive and fair.''
   He said the health-care institutions in the group will have to
``scrape up, ask for and insist on more money'' from the state and
insurance companies to pay the raises.
   A deadlock reached in May was cracked 75 minutes before the 5
a.m. strike deadline when federal mediator Brian Flores persuaded
Rivera and Abelow to meet. The two sides agreed to stop the clock
and keep talking.
   Both sides said the key to the settlement was allowing the
suspension of employer payments to an overfunded pension fund.

<HEAD>Lebanese Lawmakers Agree on Equal Moslem-Christian Split</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lebanese legislators agreed to create
a Parliament with an equal number of Moslems and Christians but
remained split today over other aspects of a new government for
their war-torn land.
   Conference sources said the political system that had given the
Christians, especially Maronite Catholics, most government posts
continued to be the focus today of the closed-door talks among 63
deputies.
   The legislators, under the auspices of the Arab League, have
been discussing since Saturday a proposed blueprint for a unified
government, one that would give Moslems an equal say.
   The old covenant, in force since independence from France in
1943, gave greater power to Christians. It gave the premier's post
to the Sunni Moslems and the Parliament speakership to the Shiite
Moslems.
   Maronites, then the majority of the population, held the
presidency and dominated the government, army, Parliament and
judiciary.
   Moslems now make up 55 percent of the population of 4 million.
   Under the proposed new system, jobs will be filled on ``merit,''
rather than sectarian basis.
   The Parliamentarians agreed on Tuesday to expand the 99-member
Parliament to ensure equal distribution of seats between Christians
and Moslems.
   Initially, an Arab League committee charged with mediating a
settlement in Lebanon had proposed that the number be increased to
128.
   But the conference sources, insisting on anonymity, said the
parliamentarians agreed Tuesday to add only nine more seats to the
present chamber, giving them all to the Moslems to make them equal
to the Christians.
   However, no agreement was reported in the debate over
presidential powers, which Moslems want curtailed to give the
Moslem premiers and house speakers a wider role in the
decision-making process.
   The Arab League committee is made up of officials from Saudi
Arabia, Morocco and Algeria. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud
al-Faisal has attended the sessions, often intervening to defuse
heated arguments.
   ``To abolish political factionalism is easier said than done,''
one deputy said, requesting anonymity. ``It indeed is an issue too
explosive for the parliamentarians to handle without prior consent
of the warlords,'' whose militias control the streets of Lebanon
after government authority has been eroded by 14 years of civil war.
   Two of these militia chiefs, Walid Jumblatt, a Druse, and Nabih
Berri, a Shiite, flew to Iran this week where they criticized the
Taif meetings, indicating they would not endorse any accord.
   ``The deputies may well agree on a new formula, but the test of
implementation will certainly prove more difficult. The Maronites
are not going to go down willingly,'' he said, alluding to the
Lebanese Forces coalition of right-wing Christian militias.
   The Lebanese Forces have not openly vetoed the reforms demanded
by Moslems as the basis for a settlement of the civil war.
   But they support the Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun,
who opposes completing any political reforms until Syrian agrees to
a timetable for withdrawing its troops in Lebanon.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate, but Aoun says it has lost its credibility
because it fought alongside Moslems in the civil war.
   Aoun and the Syrians fought bloody artillery duels for six
months before a cease-fire mediated by an Arab League committee on
Lebanon took hold 11 days ago. The 14-year conflict has killed
150,000 people.
   The Parliament meetings in Taif were not expected to produce a
final charter, but a blueprint to be ratified in a session in
Beirut tentatively scheduled for Oct. 21.

<HEAD>Soviets Could Visit Star Wars Labs This Year, U.S. Envoy Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet arms experts could visit U.S. laboratories
doing research on space-based missile defenses before the end of
the year, an American official said today.
   Henry Cooper, chief U.S. negotiator on defense and space at the
Geneva arms talks, urged Moscow to agree to regular annual
exchanges of visits to such labs as a confidence-building measure.
   He said he believed the Soviets would accept an invitation to
tour two U.S. sites, made by Secretary of State James Baker III
when Baker met with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
last month.
   Arrangements could be set during the current round of superpower
arms talks, Cooper said in an interview with the U.S. mission's
daily bulletin. The round is expected to end by early December.
   The U.S. invitation covers equipment being developed at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and a commercial testing
plant in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. Both are involved in high-tech
research for the U.S. Strategic Defense Invitiative, or Star Wars,
a project launched by former President Reagan to provide space
defenses against incoming ballistic missiles.
   Moscow has complained about the two facilities in the past, and
visits would show ``that we are serious about opening our
laboratories and increasing predictability about ballistic missiles
defense capabilities,'' Cooper said.
   Early research, which can be monitored only on-the-spot,
``provides the greatest insight into where the sides are going,''
he said.
   In the Geneva talks, the Soviets have already agreed to annual
exchanges of data on both sides' research into space-based missiles
defenses, he said.
   The U.S. offer to open SDI to Soviet experts was one of several
arms control moves at the ministerial meeting, where Shevardnadze
announced that Moscow would no longer let its objections to SDI
block the eventual signing of a treaty cutting long-nuclear forces.

<HEAD>China Criticizes Hong Kong for Allowing Swimmer to Leave</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China sharply criticized Hong Kong today for
allowing a top Chinese swimmer who defected to fly to the United
States.
   A spokesman for the local Xinhua News Agency branch, which is
China's de facto embassy in the colony, said Hong Kong had set a
bad precedent in its handling of the case and had harmed
cooperation between the governments.
   Yang Yang, 20, the No. 2 swimmer in China, left Hong Kong for
San Francisco Tuesday after being released from a detention center
under a discretionary section of the immigration code. He was
arrested Sept. 23 for having an expired visa.
   The swimmer earlier had sought political asylum in Hong Kong,
saying he feared Chinese authorities would jail him for
participating in pro-democracy marches in this British colony, but
the asylum request was denied.
   ``This has not only marred cooperation between the two sides in
this respect but will for sure adversely affect the normal contacts
between the residents of the mainland and Hong Kong,'' the
unidentified Xinhua spokesman said in remarks issued by the news
agency.
   Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents visit China each
year, with border crossings particularly heavy during the
traditional Chinese holidays.
   The agency, in paraphrasing the spokesman, said the case ``will
also cast its shadow over the cooperation between the two sides in
other fields. Only the Hong Kong government should be responsible
for all the consequences.''
   A week earlier, Xinhua issued a statement saying Chinese who
participated in pro-democracy activities in Hong Kong would not
face reprisals after returning to China.
   The incident comes at a particularly sensitive time for Hong
Kong, which reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. China has
promised the territory can retain its capitalist system for 50
years and enjoy a ``high degree of autonomy.''
   But confidence in the territory's future suffered a serious
setback when the Chinese army suppressed the pro-democracy movement
in Beijing. Tension between China and the Hong Kong and British
governments tends to exacerbate the problem.
   Local media reported that Yang was granted a non-immigrant visa
giving him permission to stay in the United States for six months.
   He could later travel to Taiwan, where he has been offered
refuge as part of the Nationalist government's plan to grant
residence to Chinese who played important roles in the
pro-democracy movement in China or elsewhere.
   The pro-Beijing New Evening Post today reported that Yang said
after arriving in San Francisco that he would not seek political
asylum in the United States and that he does not know whether he
will go to another country.

   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said
today that his country will not normalize relations with the United
States unless Washington stops aiding Angolan rebels.
   Speaking to reporters at his Futungo de Belas residence outside
Luanda, dos Santos said that despite promising peace initiatives
``war continues in Angola and Mozambique and it is caused by
foreign interference.''
   He indicated Angola would make no more concessions in its quest
for U.S. recognition of Luanda's Marxist government.
   Angola signed a truce with the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola on June 22, but peace talks with the
U.S.-backed guerrilla group broke off after military clashes
continued.
   Western diplomats in Luanda say dos Santos is disappointed by
U.S. officials, who dangled the carrot of recognition to forge
regional peace accords signed in December by Angola, Cuba and South
Africa, and then to get the Luanda government to sit at the
negotiating table with Angolan guerrillas.
   U.S. officials say diplomatic ties will be withheld until Luanda
agrees to free elections.

<HEAD>Only Two Guns Formally Rejected For Sale in Maryland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state panel set up last year under a
first-in-the-nation gun control law aimed at ridding Maryland of
Saturday Night specials has banned only two weapons and approved
627.
   An additional 34 pistols, including several small, two-shot
Derringers, have been tentatively rejected for sale or manufacture
in Maryland by the Handgun Roster Board.
   The approved list includes a semi-automatic Uzi pistol from
Israel and the Glock 17 from Austria that has some plastic parts
that don't show up on airport X-rays.
   Among other weapons approved are all handguns made by major
manufacturers such as Colt and Smith &amp; Wesson, as well as handguns
approved for importation by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
   ``The people who were advocates of the law may be disappointed
that more guns weren't excluded from the list,'' said Simon Atlas,
a member of the board. ``But that's the way the law is written.
Certainly, the worst fears the National Rifle Association had have
been laid to rest.''
   The NRA vigorously opposed the law last year when it was before
the Legislature. Among those who campaigned for the law were Sarah
Brady, wife of presidential press secretary James Brady, who was
shot and wounded along with President Reagan in 1981.
   The law makes it illegal beginning in 1990 to sell or
manufacture handguns in Maryland not approved by the nine-member
board of gubernatorial appointees. Guns made prior to 1985 are
excluded from the ban.
   Under law, the panel must consider nine criteria in weighing a
particular weapon, including concealibility, accuracy and quality,
to weed out Saturday Night specials _ the small, cheap, low-caliber
handguns often used in street crimes.
   Sanford Abrams, president of the Maryland Licensed Firearms
Dealers Association, said the criteria used by the board are
inexact, but he added, ``I think they're doing a good as job as can
be expected under the circumstances.''
   The only two weapons formally banned are .25-caliber and
.32-caliber guns made by the L.W. Seecamp Co. of New Haven, Conn.
The company no longer makes the .25-caliber model. The .32-caliber
gun, only 4[ inches long, was not considered safe enough to meet
the requirements of the handgun law.
   Larry W. Seecamp, owner of the company, called the board's
action ridiculous. He said the guns cost about $350, are well-made
and are favored by women because they are light. The company also
sells to judges, he said.
   Board member Matthew Fenton, who was shot with a handgun several
years ago, said he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the board to
ban some handguns with ``assault-type features,'' such as the Uzi
9mm semi-automatic.
   ``I asked why couldn't we just allow those for law enforcement
agencies?'' Fenton said.

   Former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson recaptured the job he
reluctantly left eight years ago, while a Mississippi Democrat won
a spot in a runoff for the state's only Republican seat in the U.S.
House.
   In Cleveland, voters took the first steps Tuesday toward
replacing popular Mayor George Voinovich, who is stepping aside to
seek the Republican nomination for governor. The city council
president and a state senator took the top two places in a mayoral
primary, boosting them into the Nov. 7 general election.
   Phoenix re-elected its incumbent Democratic Mayor Terry Goddard
but rejected the downtown baseball stadium he wanted. And
Albuquerque, N.M., Mayor Ken Schultz lost his bid to become the
first mayor to be elected to back-to-back terms since the city
switched to a mayor-council form of government 15 years ago.
   In Atlanta, Jackson overwhelmed City Councilman Hosea Williams
and four little-known candidates to recapture the job he
relinquished to Andrew Young in 1982. The law prohibited both men
from seeking a third consecutive term, and Young is weighing a race
for governor next year.
   ``Tonight, Atlanta has given me a mandate. A mandate to fulfill
the promise of our great city,'' Jackson told about 2,500 cheering
supporters. ``The future of Atlanta began tonight. A city whose
heart is stronger and whose mind is sharper begins tonight.''
   In final, unofficial returns, Jackson had 54,897 votes or 79
percent. Williams received 11,1116 votes or 16.5 percent. Four
other candidates shared 4.5 percent of the vote.
   Jackson, 51, said his new term would be different from his
previous eight-year hitch. ``Some issues will be tougher,'' he
said. However, he noted with pleasure that his margin of victory
was the largest he'd received in five tries for election in Atlanta.
   In Mississippi, where Democrats want to capture a House seat
that has been Republican for nearly 17 years, Republican Tom
Anderson muscled his way into an Oct. 17 runoff with Democratic
state Sen. Gene Taylor.
   The winner will succeed Rep. Larkin Smith, who died in a plane
crash Aug. 13.
   State Attorney General Mike Moore, a Democrat and the most
familiar name in the race, was left behind. Moore came in third and
lost even his home county where he served as district attorney for
12 years.
   Complete but unofficial returns showed Taylor with 51,383 votes
or 42 percent, to 45,623 or 37 percent for Anderson, a longtime
aide to Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss. Moore received 25,497 or 21
percent.
   Anderson received strong support from Lott, while Taylor had the
advantage of having run a strong race against Smith last year.
   Moore was criticized during the campaign for wanting to abandon
the attorney general's job that he had won just 21 months before.
   City Council President George Forbes had been considered the
frontrunner in Cleveland, and he proved the pollsters right by
easily leading the field of five candidates. State Sen. Mike White
narrowly defeated Court Clerk Benny Bonanno to take the second
runoff spot.
   Forbes received 46,493 votes or 37 percent, followed by White
with 31,440 or 25 percent. Bonanno had 28,268 votes or 23 percent,
Cuyahoga County Commissioner Tim Hagan had 11,799 votes or 9
percent and school board President Ralph J. Perk Jr. had 5,891
votes or 5 percent.
   In Phoenix, Goddard won a fourth term, defeating state
Republican Party Chairman Burton Kruglick by a 2-1 margin, 89,386
votes to 46,277. Real estate broker Norris Inman was a distant
third. But the stadium, which was intended to lure a baseball
expansion team to Phoenix, lost 88,516 to 61,455.
   ``I don't know what the message is,'' Goddard said. ``Obviously,
that's one of the things we'll have to spend a lot of time trying
to analyze.''
   In Albuquerque, Democrats Louis Saavedra and Pat Baca will face
each other in a runoff election for mayor after blocking Schultz's
re-election bid.
   With all 156 precincts counted, Saavedra, the retired former
president of the Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute, led
nine candidates with 25,584 votes, or 33 percent. Baca, a longtime
member of City Council and retired educator, finished second but
made the runoff with 18,044 votes, 23.2 percent.
   Schultz finished with 8,370 votes, for just 10.7 percent.
   In Escondido, Calif., abortion rights advocate Tricia Hunter won
a special election for a state Assembly seat, defeating her
Democratic opponent and a fellow Republican who mounted a strong
write-in campaign and opposes abortion.

   Seven more killings were
reported today in Natal Province, where the failure of peace talks
between black factions has been accompanied by some of the worst
bloodshed of a 3-year-old power struggle.
   The feud has claimed at least 15 lives so far this month, and
monitoring groups say more than 95 people were killed last month,
when negotiations between leaders of militant anti-apartheid groups
and the more conservative Zulu political organization Inkatha
reached an impasse.
   The anti-apartheid alliance, in a statement today, suggested
that Inkatha leader Mangotuthu Buthelezi has misused the peace
process to seek political gain. The alliance also accused police of
bias against its followers.
   More than 2,000 blacks have been killed since factional fighting
began on a sustained basis in late 1986.
   The current peace initiative started in June, and the monthly
death toll dropped by more than half, to about 40, as both sides
issued positive statements. But Inkatha last month suspended its
participation in the talks because it felt the other side remained
hostile.
   Opposing Inkatha are supporters of the United Democratic Front,
a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition, and the Congress of South
African Trade Unions, the largest black labor federation. Both
groups favor militant anti-government protest actions and endorse
the political views of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement.
   Inkatha, which claims 1.5 million members, rejects the ANC's use
of violence and opposes hard-line protest strategies such as
boycotts, general strikes and economic sanctions.
   At a news conference, leaders of the United Democratic Front and
the labor federation suggested Buthelezi was more interested in
enhancing his political position than in achieving peace.
   ``A peace process must be initiated with or without Inkatha,''
the two organizations said. ``We cannot resolve the violence by
continually stressing our differences and by attempting to
politically embarrass each other.''
   In preliminary talks, negotiators proposed a formal peace
conference involving 10-member delegations from Inkatha, the ANC,
the United Democratic Fron and the trade union congress.
   However, Inkatha's leadership declared last month that there
should only be two 10-member delegations, its own and one
representing all the other groups. Inkatha also said it wants a
personal reply from the ANC in response to a letter Buthelezi sent
regarding arrangements for the talks.
   The unrest report issued today by police headquarters said six
men and a woman were killed overnight in four separate incidents in
Mpumalanga and Taylor's Halt in central Natal. Following standard
police practice, no details were given about the affiliations of
those involved.
   A clash involving roughly 800 men was reported in Mpumalanga on
Monday, and several houses in the area have been burned down by
attackers.
   Also today, an opposition political leader challenged the
Pretoria city council to follow the example of Johannesburg, Cape
Town and other cities by ending segregation of public facilities.
   Tertius Spies, the regional leader of the anti-apartheid
Democratic Party, said municipal buses, libraries, parks and
swimming pools were off-limits to blacks in the nation's capital,
despite claims by the governing National Party that apartheid was
dead. The National Party controls Pretoria's city council, which
Spies said was ``dragging its heels.''

   The approximately $3 million agreement was to be signed today in

Housing Authority in 1988.
   Under the settlement, the largest group of people eligible for
up to $2,500 each in damages comprises 1,058 families who say they
applied for apartments in predominantly white housing projects in
the Charlestown, South Boston and East Boston neighborhoods over
the last decade but were passed over for white applicants.
   ``We hope this sends a message to the institutions that
discrimination costs,'' said Dianne Wilkerson, chairwoman of the
housing committee of the Boston chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
   About 450 other families are eligible for damages of $1,000 to
$3,000 each.
   Under the settlement, the city admitted no wrongdoing.
   The settlement also requires the BHA to create a $500,000 fund
to make grants to encourage integration in the city's public
housing.

   A Lebanese hijacker lured into U.S. custody
was sentenced today to 30 years in federal prison for comandeering
a Jordanian airliner in 1985 and holding its crew and passengers
hostage for 30 hours.
   U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson sentenced Fawaz Younis
to 30 years in prison for taking hostages, 20 years for aircraft
piracy and five years for conspiracy. The sentences are to run
concurrently.
   Robinson could have imposed a term of life imprisonment, but he
noted that no one on the plane had been killed. He said, however,
that a lengthy prison term is required because time ``will never
wipe out what is in the minds'' of the passengers and crew
subjected to the hijacking.
   Younis, who has spent the past two years in custody, could be
eligible for parole in eight years, U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said
after the sentencing.
   Stephens said the term is ``fair'' and ``substantial'' and that
it sends ``a clear message'' to people ``who would engage in acts
of international terrorism.''
   At his sentencing, the convicted hijacker asked the judge for
leniency, saying he is not a terrorist and that he treated the two
Americans aboard the airliner as ``friends.''
   Younis was convicted March 14 of storming the Jordanian airliner
in Beirut with four other gunmen and holding the 70 passengers and
crew hostage for 30 hours. All aboard, including two Americans,
were freed before the plane was blown up.
   In 1987, Younis was lured aboard a yacht in the Mediterranean on
the pretext of a drug deal and grabbed by undercover FBI agents.
U.S. officials have hailed the case as a strong signal that the
United States will take whatever steps necessary to deal with
terrorists.
   Younis was found innocent of threatening violence against
passengers, destroying a civilian aircraft and carrying explosive
devices aboard the plane.
   ``Why does the American government want to depict me as a
terrorist, and believe that I am a threat to it?'' Younis asked in
a letter to the judge last week.
   He said there is ``a huge difference between me, and those
others'' involved in terrorism.
   Younis, a member of the Amal movement, said he was instructed by
his superiors to hijack an aircraft and fly it to Tunis, Tunisia,
where a meeting of Arab League representatives was in progress.
   During the hijacking, he read a declaration demanding the league
decide that one Arab nation allow all Palestinians to settle in the
country and that Palestinians be removed from Lebanon.
   ``The thorny problem for this court is that Mr. Younis has
previously stated and continues to believe that his actions were
political in nature,'' his lawyer, Francis Carter, said in court
papers.
   In a memo to the judge last week, the U.S. attorney's office
said Younis was one of the members of Amal who held American
hostages in Beirut in connection with the hijacking of TWA Flight
847, days after the hijacking of the Jordanian airliner.
   In the TWA hijacking, Navy diver Robert Stethem was murdered.
   Younis admitted he had been among the first to enter the TWA
airliner when it landed at Beirut Airport, said the government's
sentencing memo.
   Carter said Hezbollah terrorists, not the Amal movement,
hijacked the TWA plane. The Amal, at the request of the U.S.
government, worked to negotiate the release of the hostages, taking
custody of some to prevent all the passengers and crew from falling
into the hands of Hezbollah, Carter said.
   ``No one from the Amal movement was aboard the plane when ...
Stethem was killed,'' Carter said.

   A United Airlines jet preparing for an emergency
landing dumped 330 gallons of fuel over a suburb, spraying a group
of children and new cars.
   The Boeing 727 carrying 83 people returned safely to O'Hare
International Airport on Tuesday after a faulty air duct activated
a fire warning light on takeoff for Salt lake City, authorities
said. No evidence of fire was found.
   Anne Tartol, a bicycle safety instructor, was teaching 32
8-year-olds in Mount Prospect when the jet passed overhead.
   ``I looked up. We felt a spray, like a mist. There was smoke
around the plane. Our sunglasses filmed over. We smelled awful,''
she said. ``The kids started saying it was snowing.''
   Mount Prospect Fire Department Lt. Art Felski said the exposure
was probably only minimal and that there was little health risk for
the children.
   Ordinarily, a jet making an emergency landing dumps it fuel over
an uninhabited area or from a high enough altitude that evaporates
before reaching the ground.
   A car dealership also reported being sprayed by the fuel.
   ``There's an oily film over all of the cars and trucks out here,
about two-thirds of my inventory,'' said David Schmerler, a Ford
dealer.
   ``I called United and they said they had an emergency landing
situation. I told them that now I've got an emergency business
situation.''

<HEAD>Mexican Leader Promises US Congress Action on Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
told a joint meeting of Congress today his country intends ``to
eradicate drug trafficking at its very roots'' but he said the war
against drugs globally is being lost.
   Salinas, who is here on a state visit, also stepped up his
campaign for greater access for Mexican products to U.S. markets,
descibing as an ``inequitable paradox'' the relative openness of
Mexico to foreign imports compared with the United States.
   While pledging a continued all-out effort to curb drug
smuggling, Salinas ruled out joint U.S.-Mexican military operations
to fight the traffickers.
   ``Mexico intends to eradicate drug trafficking at its very roots
in the sphere that falls under its responsibility,'' Salinas said,
speaking in Spanish while his listerners read from copies
translated into English.
   ``This world fight is also our own,'' he said. He added that
mutual finger pointing about who is to blame for continued drug use
wastes time and effort that should be spent attacking the common
enemy.
   Salinas received a warm welcome from the assembled gathering
when he entered the House chamber, a reflection of the marked
improvement in U.S.-Mexican relations since he assumed the
presidency 10 months ago.
   But, consistent with most addresses by foreign leaders before
joint meetings of Congress, only a small percentage of the 535
voting members actually were present. Most of the seats were filled
by congressional pages.
   Salinas, who met on Tuesday with President Bush, said there is a
``mature and responsible understanding'' of the links in the ``drug
chain of terror.'' He added that there is greater acceptance in the
United States regarding the importance of giving greater emphasis
to reducing demand for drugs.
   Previously, the United States put much of its focus on reducing
the supply through interdiction and other efforts.
   While stressing Mexico's willingness to cooperate, Salinas said
the struggle worldwide against drug use has suffered setbacks.
   ``When we see the magnitude of the fight against drugs, we must
honestly ask ourselves: are we winning or losing the war? I think
that, at the world level, we are losing and that is unacceptable.''
He said the solution lies in more cooperation among governments.
   On trade, Salinas said Mexico needs ``greater reciprocity'' to
ensure that it will continue to be one of the most open economies
in the world.
   ``Our country is practically free of (trade) barriers, but we
continue confronting them in the United States,'' Salinas said.
``Let us resolve this inequitable paradox. We seek greater access
to the textile and steel markets and the Generalized System of
Preferences. We want a bilateral agreement that will break down
trade barriers, sector by sector.''
   U.S. officials have expressed irritation with Salinas' portrayal
of the United States as a protectionist nation. They point out that
two-thirds of Mexico's exports come to the United States and that
Mexico had a $2.7 billion surplus in its U.S. trade last year on
total two-way trade of about $44 billion.

   Wilbur Trammell's bid to become Buffalo's
first black mayor has been set back by a court ruling invalidating
his independent party petitions.
   The former judge said he would appeal the decision reached
Tuesday night.
   The ruling could keep Trammell off the November ballot and allow
James D. Griffin to run with no ballot opposition for an
unprecedented fourth four-year term.
   In its unanimous decision, the appellate division of State
Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that petitions to place
Trammell on the ballot as an independent were invalid because he
failed to have a document notarized.
   Trammell said if his appeal fails, he will run as a write-in
candidate.
   ``Let the people of Buffalo, not the court, make a decision
about the mayor of Buffalo,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Urged to Overturn Dallas Ordinance on Sexually Oriented Businesses</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 15 grafs new with arguments; picks up 4th graf pvs, The
1986 ordinance.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A skeptical Supreme Court was urged today to
overturn a Dallas ordinance that imposes strict licensing
requirements for sexually oriented businesses.
   John H. Weston, a Beverly Hills, Calif., lawyer representing the
businesses, said the Texas city's ordinance imposes ``a prior
restraint'' on free speech that violates the Constitution.
   Under the ordinance, ``one may not disseminate speech one has
chosen to disseminate absent a permit,'' Weston said. The local law
``permits the city to do indirectly what it can not do directly,''
he said.
   ``We're not dealing with nuclear power plants,'' Weston added in
arguing there is no lawful ground for such strict rules.
   But the justices repeatedly challenged Weston's assertions.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, addressing one of the
lawyer's main arguments, said there is no precedent for giving
special consideration to bookstores seeking licenses to do business.
   ``There is no (Supreme Court) case close to suggesting that,''
Rehnquist said.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in frequently barbed questioning, said
to Weston, ``You mean that every bookstore cannot be subject to
normal business licensing?''
   Dallas City Attorney Analeslie Muncy said the ordinance is a
vital weapon against crime and urban decay.
   The licensing rules are aimed at businesses that ``are 100
percent sexually oriented,'' she said.
   She added that nothing prevents the business owners from
distributing their wares in other ways.
   ``They can sell the same material through the mails, door to
door or on a street corner,'' she said.
   The justices are expected to announce a ruling by July,
providing new guidelines on how far communities may go to limit
sexually oriented businesses.
   The Dallas ordinance is being challenged by owners of adult
bookstores, motion picture theaters, nightclubs and motels.
   The law also applies to nude-model studios and sexual-encounter
establishments. But no such businesses were represented in today's
case.
   The 1986 ordinance requires sexually oriented businesses to
obtain a license issued by the city police chief.
   Such businesses must permit inspection of their premises during
operating hours. No one convicted of a variety crimes, including
promoting prostitution, may obtain a license.
   The ordinance also bars motel owners from renting rooms for less
than 10 hours, a provision intended to discourage prostitution.
Establishments offering sexually oriented entertainment must be
open to surveillance by authorities without search warrants.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the local law. The
appeals court said the city's campaign against urban blight, crime
and declining property values provides ``compelling justification''
for the regulations.
   ``The city need only show that a (criminal) conviction and the
evil to be regulated bear a substantial relationship'' to justify
that aspect of the ordinance, the appeals court said.
   It also said that the discretion given the police chief to
issue, suspend and revoke licenses is not impermissibly broad.
   The Supreme Court in 1986 upheld a Renton, Wash., ordinance
restricting the location of adult theaters.
   The Dallas ordinance also contains strict zoning rules. But the
justices rejected a challenge to those provisions in the Dallas
law, leaving them intact.
   Several groups have joined the Dallas business owners in
attacking the ordinance. They include the American Booksellers
Association, the Association of American Publishers, the National
Association of College Stores and the Freedom to Read Foundation.
   Citizens for Decency Through Law and the American Family
Association lined up to support the Dallas ordinance.

still stand, extradition of reputed drug dealer pending. Pickup 12th pvs,

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has upheld President
Virgilio Barco's decree allowing extradition of accused drug bosses
to the United States but overturned his order to seize their
ranches, mansions and other property.
   The government, meanwhile, was preparing to send another alleged
drug trafficker to the United States.
   The court met Tuesday to rule on constitutional aspects of
decrees Barco issued as part of a 7-week-old crackdown on
Colombia's drug cartels.
   The decisions by the 24-member Supreme Court preserve Barco's
main weapon in his government's unprecedented crackdown on cocaine
traffickers, who have used murder, bribery and intimidation to
thwart Colombian efforts to bring them to justice.
   But the court ruled that a Barco decree allowing property
seizures did not specifically cite drug traffickers and threw it
out on a technicality.
   However, Barco today made a statement saying he issued another
decree a year ago that specifically did cite drug traffickers. The
court now must rule on that decree.
   Meanwhile, military raids are expected to continued. The
government already has seized 1,056 homes, ranches, mansions and
other properties belonging to drug barons.
   U.S. officials say that because Colombian cocaine bosses are
unable to intimidate U.S. judges the traffickers fear extradition
more than any other measure against them. Since 1981, about 50
Colombian judges have been killed in attacks blamed on the drug
gangs.
   Traffickers of the Medellin cocaine cartel said last month in a
letter to Barco that they prefer a grave in Colombia to a U.S. jail.
   On Sept. 6, Colombia extradited Eduardo Martinez, an economist
thought to work for the Medellin cartel. Martinez was sent to
Atlanta to face federal charges of laundering millions of cartel
drug dollars.
   U.S. and Colombian authorities have begun extradition procedures
against another drug suspect, Ana Rodriguez de Tamayo, indicted in
1983 in Miami on conspiracy and drug trafficking charges.
   Authorities last week notified Ana Rodriguez de Tamayo that her
extradition was pending, and her five-day appeal period expires
Thursday.
   Rodriguez de Tamayo was indicted in Miami in 1983 on conspiracy
and drug trafficking charges. The national radio chain Caracol said
today that the government had taken final legal steps toward her
extradition, making that possible at any time now.
   The United States also wants extraditon of two other purported
traffickers, Bernardo Pelaez Roldan and Guillermo Bueno Delgado,
recently captured by Colombian authorities.
   Tuesday's court ruling on the extraditions backs the Barco
administration at a time when the conflict shows no signs of
abating.
   Since Barco declared the crackdown hours after the assassination
of a leading presidential candidate Aug. 18, authorities have
blamed drug traffickers for at least 142 bombings.
   By ruling extradition constitutional, the court helped allay
fears that the justice system would undermine Barco's campaign.
   The court has a history of resisting Barco's efforts to use
state of siege powers to fight leftist guerrillas and drug
traffickers. In 1984, the high court, ruling on a technicality,
declared extraditions to the United States unconstitutional.
   In apparently unrelated violence, a Defense Ministry source said
leftist guerrillas kidnapped and killed a Catholic bishop in the
northeastern state of Arauca.
   The source said the National Liberation Army had kidnapped
Bishop Jesus Emilio Jaramillo on Monday and that the church
official's body was found Tuesday near the town of Arauquita on the
border with Venezuela.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was
no indication why the bishop may have been murdered.
   The National Liberation Army is headed by a defrocked priest,
Manuel Perez. The Defense Ministry source said the bishop was
killed by another defrocked priest serving under Perez.

   Riot police fired tear gas today to
disperse university students protesting the arrest of two student
leaders.
   An estimated 4,000 students boycotted classes and many fought
running battles with baton-wielding riot squads, a student
spokesman said.
   Stones were thrown at police, and the windows of a limousine
used by the Zimbabwe University vice chancellor, Professor Walter
Kamba, were smashed by rioters, said the spokesman who requested
anonymity.
   Sporadic clashes continued throughout the day, and the
semi-official Zimbabwe Inter African News Agency said more than 50
protesters were arrested.
   It was not clear whether students were injured.
   Deputy Police Commissioner Douglas Chingoka was quoted as saying
that the unrest was ``very well under control.''
   The news agency said university officials were scheduled to meet
with President Robert Mugabe to discuss the student protests.
   In a leaflet distributed before the start of classes today,
student leaders called for a meeting on campus to discuss the
arrests today of student council members Arthur Mutambara and Enock
Chikweche.
   The leaflet said police surrounded and stormed a campus
residence and Mutambara was ``profusely bleeding'' after jumping
from a second-floor window in an effort to escape from police who
broke down the door of his bedroom.
   ``The notorious riot police have struck,'' said the leaflet. It
described student action in response as ``a matter of life and
death.''
   Student leaders said they believed Mutambara's arrest was
prompted by a statement he issued Oct. 2 criticizing the government
and university authorities.
   That statement said police banned a student meeting scheduled
for Sept. 29 to mark the first anniversary of a student
demonstration organized in 1988 to protest official corruption.
   In the past year, college students have staged several
demonstrations in which they accused the government of stifling
free expression and curbing academic freedoms.
   Education minister Fay Chung labeled students ``hooligans and
drunkards'' and said they were being manipulated by political
opponents to attack the government.

<HEAD>Baker Says US Reserves Right to Use Force In Panama</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines urgent series; Edits throughout; Includes Pentagon
comments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today the United States reserves the right to use military force
against Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, and
dismissed ``armchair generals'' who faulted the administration for
failing to support Tuesday's failed coup with American troops.
   ``The United States retains the option to use American forces.
That option has never been ruled out,'' Baker told the Senate
Finance Committee. ``But if you're going to risk American lives,
it's the president's view that you do so on your own timetable.
   ``You do so based on your own plans. At a time of maximum
opportunity and advantage. You don't do so on the basis of someone
else's plans and in response to rapidly changing circumstances,''
he said.
   At the Pentagon, one official said various military options were
discussed Tuesday with President Bush as the coup unfolded. Another
official said: ``When it appeared as though Noriega might have been
dethroned ... there were several options considered, none of which
was going in and getting him.'' Both spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   Baker deftly sidestepped whether the administration played any
role in the failed coup attempt, but he implied that the United
States had kept its distance because the rebels had little chance
of ousting Noriega.
   A number of members of Congress, including Sen. David Boren,
D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee criticized
the Bush administration after the short-lived coup for what they
said was failure to support members of the special security unit
that tried to take over Noriega's central command post.
   ``It's easy to be an armchair general,'' Baker said, without
informing the committee members whether the rebels had at least
tacit assurances of U.S. support, as some reports have suggested.
   Baker said President Bush acted immediately to do two things _
to safeguard American lives and to assure the security of the
Panama Canal, just as the United States is obligated to do under
the Panama Canal treaties.
   The treaties call on the United States to turn control of the
American-built canal at the end of the century and to maintain the
neutrality of the waterway.
   U.S. troops at the Southern Command in Panama said the situation
today is calm but troops and civilians remained under a Delta
advisory, which means they are to avoid unnecessary travel outside
U.S.-controlled areas, the Pentagon said.
   Officials acknowledged Tuesday they had advance word of a coup
attempt, but the president said the United States did not engineer
it.
   ``We had some indications this sort of thing was in the works,''
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, ``but until it
happens, you never know.'' He characterized the prior information
as ``rumblings.''
   But Baker provided no details of the precise steps taken by the
White House while events unfolded on Tuesday in Panama. He said
they were breaking rapidly.
   ``It is easy after the fact in one of these situations to
second-guess the events by arguing that the United States should
have done something differently,'' Baker said.
   He told the committee the administration considered Noriega's
government ``an outlaw regime'' and would continue pressuring for
him to give up power.
   ``Our policy has been to apply relentless pressure on the
Noriega regime. Across the board _ diplomatically, economically and
to defend American lives and United States rights under our Panama
Canal treaties,'' he said.
   Some members of Congress said Bush could have provided military
support to the rebel forces which tried to depose Noriega. The
general is sought in the United States on drug trafficking charges.
   ``Once again we have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,
and I think it's an outrage,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, ranking
Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee. Boren said
Tuesday it was wrong for the United States, with its 12,000
military personnel in Panama, ``to stand by ... and do nothing, and
allow these people to fail.''
   But Vice President Dan Quayle had said, ``We're not going to be
involved in any kind of a coup attempt in Latin America,'' and this
morning Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, a moderate Republican,
dismissed the criticism. ``It's very easy to be an armchair
general,'' he told NBC.
   The Washington Times today quoted congressional sources as
saying that in advance of Tuesday's attempt, American military
officers in Panama led the rebels to believe they would get U.S.
military help.
   An unidentified senior administration official told The
Washington Post that rebel leaders had passed word at least three
times this week that an effort to topple Noriega was imminent. One
official told The New York Times that the United States had agreed
to tae custody of Noriega if the rebels captured him. Another
official told the Times that before it became clear Noriega had not
been captured, the United States had asked to have him turned over
and the rebels refused.
   ``I want to see democracy in Panama succeed,'' Bush insisted
after it became apparent Tuesday that Noriega had squashed the coup.
   ``Am I disappointed that Noriega is still there? Yes I am,'' he
said later.
   ``Nothing's changed. Everything remains the same. We'll continue
to press for Noriega's removal'' and his arrest to stand trial in
the United States, said Fitzwater.
   Bush turned aside further questions Tuesday night at a state
dinner for visiting Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   But Quayle said, ``I`m not sure what we could have done'' to
help the anti-Noriega forces. ``This is a situation that is going
to be handled within Panama. We're not going to be involved in any
kind of a coup attempt in Latin America ... This is Panama's
problem.''
   Earlier Tuesday Bush gave verbal support to the still-battling
coup leaders in comments to reporters. He said the administration
has ``no argument'' with Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces, only
with the dictator himself. Bush has made similar comments over the
past several months, in what some saw as barely disguised goading
for the PDF to mount a coup.
   Saying he hoped his words would be ``conveyed instantly'' to
Panama, the president said, ``Our argument has been ... with Mr.
Noriega who aborted the democratic will of the people of Panama,''
a reference to Noriega's invalidation of last May's election that
observers said was overwhelmingly won by his opposition.
   ``There were rumors around that this was some American operation
and I can tell you that is not true,'' Bush told reporters at an
Oval Office photo session.
   ``We did not take any action that would have constituted direct
involvement,'' said Fitzwater, adding that U.S. helicopters
observed the fighting and troops were stationed ``around one of the
causeways there to protect access and rights and so forth.''

<HEAD>Calls for Multiparty System in Yugoslavia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Ante Markovic called for a
multiparty system as a solution for the country's growing economic
and political problems and charged that conservative Communists are
blocking his reforms.
   ``The logic of pluralistic ownership, which demands a system of
its own, will have to demand and open the society to a multiparty
system,'' he said in a television interview Tuesday night.
   Markovic's statement challenged a Communist Party ruling that
allows existence of multiple parties only under the the Socialist
Alliance, a Communist-dominated umbrella group.
   Despite growing calls for change, the Communist Party has so far
blocked the multiparty systems gradually being embraced by Warsaw
Pact allies Hungary and Poland.
   Markovic, however, said that the ``new socialism'' he has sought
to introduce as part of his market-oriented economic reforms is
meeting with growing resistance of the Communists.
   He said that opponents to his economic reforms expressed concern
that state property would become ``threatened'' by the planned
economic liberalization.
   ``I expect now an intensification of the conflict between
ideology and (reforms),'' Markovic said.
   Yugoslavia's annual inflation rate hit an all-time record of
nearly 1,200 percent, mostly due to sharp increases in the prices
of vital staples and services, such as electricity, meat and bread.
   Officials in the country's largest republic, Serbia, have said
they will demand Markovic's resignation if his program does not
quickly curb the rampant inflation.
   In a speech when he became premier in March, Markovic called an
open-market economy ``an ultimate achievement of mankind for which
no alternative has yet been found.''
   He demanded urgent introduction of stocks and bonds, private
initiative and entrepreneurship in the Yugoslav economy and an end
to state interference in the running of businesses.
   Other segments of the radical market-oriented economic reforms
underlined by Markovic would include the reshaping of the banking
system along Western lines, creation of a capital market, and an
end to state subsidies for loss-making enterprises.
   In addition to Europe's highest inflation rate Yugoslavia is
burdened by a $19 billion foreign debt, a 17 percent unemployment
rate and growing labor and ethnic unrest.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own government and party structure. Serbia
is dominated by hard-line Communists.
   The decentralized system of government and collective federal
presidency were devised in 1974 Constitution to prevent one
republic from gaining sway over the others, but it has resulted in
an ineffective government by compromise.
   In Yugoslavia, the federal government is generally responsible
for economic policy while the collective presidency, which appoints
the premier, dictates defense and foreign policy.
   But the bulk of political influence in the country is
concentrated in the Communist Party, with power dispersed in eight
often fractious central committees reflecting the administrative
division of the country.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Votes to Liberalize IRAs</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs. Inserts grafs 6-7 with Bush renewing call for capital gains
cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An evenly divided Senate Finance Committee
refused early today to reduce the tax on capital gains, voting
instead to liberalize Individual Retirement Accounts in an effort
to encourage saving.
   The 10-10 vote was split nearly along party lines, but both
sides agreed the battle will be fought again on the Senate floor,
perhaps later this week.
   The vote came on an amendment by Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., to
substitute a capital gains cut for the expanded IRAs that Chairman
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, had written into the bill. The Bush
administration supports Packwood's plan.
   The tie vote retained Bentsen's plan to liberalize IRAs.
   Each side argued that the other's plan was more beneficial to
those with higher incomes, but there was little of the emotional
debate that marked House passage of a different capital gains cut
and rejection of the same IRA proposal a week earlier.
   President Bush today prodded the Senate to follow the House's
example and sharply reduce the capital gains tax. The House version
would cut the tax on capital gains, now 28 to 33 percent, to 19.6
percent for two years, then index it to inflation.
   Bush, addressing a group of minority small business people,
said, ``This is a tax cut for all, a way to channel investment back
into new growth and new jobs. ... It is a job-oriented tax cut.''
   The vote against the capital gains cut came as the committee
completed work on a bill whose chief purpose is to reduce the 1990
federal budget deficit by about $8 billion. The bill was approved
on a voice vote early today.
   Most of the deficit reduction would come from a package of
relatively minor revenue increases, including permanent extension
of the 3 percent tax on local and long distance telephone service.
   The biggest single money-raiser in the bill is a $3.6 billion
reduction in government Medicare reimbursements for doctors and
hospitals.
   The remainder would come from a potpourri of relatively minor
tax changes, mostly affecting corporations.
   Numerous provisions that have no relation to deficit reduction
were tacked onto the bill. One of the biggest was a
$1-billion-a-year saving for Social Security recipients between the
ages of 65 and 69 who continue to work past the traditional
retirement age.
   With all nine Republicans and Democrat David Boren of Oklahoma
in opposition, the committee voted to allow all workers to take a
tax deduction for half an IRA contribution of up to $2,000 a year.
   Most of the tax saving on that change would go to workers making
more than $50,000 a year, since those below that income level
already are permitted fully or partially deductible accounts.
   Workers at all income levels would be allowed to take
penalty-free withdrawals from their IRAs to make the down payment
on a first home or to pay for a college education.
   Under Packwood's amendment, the longer a share of stock, land or
other investment was owned, the less its profits would be taxed
when sold. For example, 95 percent of the profit would be taxed if
sold after one year; after six years, 70 percent would be taxed.
   The legislation includes several miscellaneous tax cut
provisions, in addition to expanded IRAs, that have nothing to do
with reducing the budget deficit.
   Those include new assistance for rural hospitals and extension
of several expiring tax breaks, including those for employer-paid
education assistance; first-time homebuyers and corporations that
increase spending for research.
   It would increase to $14,500 a year the amount that people
between the ages of 65 and 69 may earn without losing any of their
Social Security benefits. The ``earnings limitation'' this year is
$8,880; for each $3 earned above that level, the beneficiary loses
$1 of Social Security.
   The bill would repeal a scheduled decline in the 8 percent
airline passenger ticket tax; the completed-contract method of
accounting that permits big builders and defense contractors to
defer taxes; and a lucrative tax benefit for some corporations that
borrow to fund an employee stock-ownership plan.

<HEAD>Six Police Officers Indicted on Civil Rights Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six police officers have been indicted on civil
rights charges in the December beating death of a suspected drug
dealer who allegedly had put out a murder contract on one of them.
   A federal grand jury Tuesday indicted the six members of the
Miami police force's elite street narcotics unit. They face a
maximum of life in prison if convicted.
   Four of the officers were arrested and the others had
surrendered by early today.
   Leonardo Mercado, 35, a small-time crack dealer, died Dec. 16
after police received an anonymous tip that he had put out a
contract on Officer Pablo Camacho.
   Mercado was beaten at a relative's house. Witnesses said the
officers took Mercado inside the home, shut the door and pulled a
curtain closed. Rescue workers took him to a hospital, where he
died a short time later.
   Camacho and Officers Charlie Haynes, Ronald Sinclair, Thomas
Trujillo, Nathaniel Veal and Andy Watson were each charged with
four civil rights violations, said Diane Cossin, executive
assistant to U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   The six were relieved of their duties soon after the death.
   The Police Department was rocked earlier in the decade by
charges that 15 officers stole drugs from smugglers and resold
them. The 15 were blamed for the drownings of three drug boat
guards, who leaped into the Miami River in a 1985 raid.

   A 56-pound weight fell from a building's
17th-floor scaffolding and hit a court officer in the head, killing
him, authorities said.
   Sgt. John Dauway, 48, was the second person killed by an object
falling from the office building in the Brooklyn Heights section. A
lawyer was killed in 1982 by a chunk of decorative terra cotta that
fell from the 16th floor.
   The weight that hit the 19-year state Supreme Court officer had
anchored a scaffold and beam that held construction pulleys. The
building was being renovated.
   Construction worker Sammy Santiago said he saw the weight fall,
miss the protective structure erected over the sidewalk and hit
Dauway.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on chemical weapons:
   If hypocrisy was an international crime, the United States would
be guilty.
   On one hand, the nation is building a stockpile of chemical
weapons.
   On the other, it condemns countries such as Libya and Iraq for
producing chemical arms.
   Intellectual conflicts like that aside, the world's superpowers
and other nations finally seem positioned to make major progress
toward a ban on chemical weapons.
   Encouragingly, President Bush's condemnation of such weapons
last week before the United Nations General Assembly was well
received.
   Bush offered to cut U.S. stocks of chemical weapons by more than
80 percent if the Soviet Union would do the same.
   The Soviet Union, in turn, said it would radically reduce or
completely destory its chemical weapons, halt nuclear tests and
stop making weapons-grade plutonium and uranium if the United
States would do the same.
   Bush's proposal would require that the Soviet Union make deeper
cuts than the United States, because the Soviets have more chemical
weapons. That might be a stumbling block toward further progress.
So will the very breadth of the Soviet proposal, which also would
affect nuclear weapons.
   But some of the biggest obstacles had to be overcome just to get
this far. Continued progress is welcome, whether it is wrapped in
hypocrisy or not.

   Seattle Post-Intelligencer on Colombia:
   The cocaine-beseiged president of Colombia, Virgilio Barco, made
some eminently reasonable requests of the United States on his
visit to Washington last week.
   Barco, who is trying to get tough with the drug lords who all
but run his country, did not come seeking more financial aid.
Instead, he asked for help of a different sort than merely throwing
money at the problem.
   Barco rightly enough wants the U.S. to restore a coffee-export
quota system that favors Colombia. When the U.S. blocked renewal of
the quota agreement last July, world coffee prices plummeted. The
effect of this in Colombia is to turn more coffee farmers into
cocaine farmers, a development that is not in this nation's
self-interest.
   Barco also asked President Bush to curtail the export from the
U.S. to Colombia of chemicals used to manufacture cocaine and to
limit production of the automatic weapons used by the drug lords.
   And Barco asked members of Congress for greater efforts to
educate Americans against the use of drugs to help shut off the
market.
   In taking on the drug lords, Barco is risking his life. The
least this government can do is support policies that make Barco's
unenviable task less daunting.

   The Providence (R.I.) Sunday Journal on the capital gains tax:
   In retrospect, it is hardly surprising that President Bush's
capital gains tax cut should win so handily in the House of
Representatives last week.
   Politicians can scarcely resist voting for a plan to get
something for nothing, and despite all the rhetoric to the
contrary, that is just what this tax cut offered. ...
   The ``rich'' that (Majority Leader Richard) Gephardt insists
will be the only beneficiaries of a capital gains tax cut include
low- and middle-income earners who would benefit only after cashing
in their investments. ...
   Many of these same people voted for George Bush last November,
and (the) unexpectedly lopsided vote on capital gains may indicate
that their interests are being recognized by a growing number of
legislators.
   This trend, if it spreads to related tax and budget issues,
could provide the president with a working majority in Congress,
similar to the one forged by Ronald Reagan in 1981.
   We believe the economic policies that would emerge from Capitol
Hill under those circumstances would be good for the country.

   Hobbs (N.M.) Daily News-Sun on mail and telephone frauds:
   Careless about who spends your money?
   You are if you give out your credit card numbers to strangers
who solicit your business over the telephone, and you are if you
send out checks to ``official looking'' contest companies who
inform you that you can collect a fat prize if you will only send
them money to pay for processing your award.
   These scams and hundreds more just like them are literally
flooding the U.S. mails today, going out to countless millions of
unsuspecting Americans, and there is little difficulty in these
rip-off artists reaching almost everyone with a post office address.
   It's a crying shame that billions of dollars are being bilked
out of millions of Americans by reason of an all-out assault on
them through the mails and via telephones; and two things make it
possible: Federal regulations are not sufficiently strict to
prevent massive mail and telephone fraud, and too many people (the
victims) still believe there is a free lunch.
   We urge Congress to devise effective anti-fraud laws for the
nation's communications systems to prevent the robbery of innocent
people.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on the lack of AZT for children:
   Hundreds of kids are suffering and dying because they are unable
to obtain azidothymidine, the most effective treatment against AIDS.
   Burroughs Wellcome Co., the manufacturer, says it's moving as
fast as it can to make AZT available to kids. But the assurance
rings hollow since the company has yet to apply for government
approval to market the drug to children under 12.
   Critics say the company is dragging its feet because the
potential market among children is small.
   Until the drug receives FDA approval for the children, the
insurance companies and the federal government will not pick up its
cost ... about $6,000 a year _ which many parents cannot afford.
   In addition, the adult formulation of AZT is too strong for
children. The capsules must be broken and smaller amounts of the
foul-tasting medicine mixed with juice or another liquid.
   The situation is absurd. The company should file an application
as soon as possible and develop a dosage that is appropriate for
childern. AIDS doesn't discriminate against children. Neither
should Burroughs.

   The Jackson (Mich.) Citizen Patriot on plans to redesign coins:
   Tinkering with the U.S. monetary system is an itch that Congress
can't seem to scratch enough. So, would someone do our fearless
leaders a favor and send a gallon or two of anti-itch oil?
   In recent months, a majority of senators and representatives in
Congress have supported legislation to change the basic designs of
all of our coins. As one advocate put it, Congress believes that
Americans want new coins that aren't so ``fixed in the past.''
   Congress would have us remove the ``old baldie,'' the American
eagle. It would be farewell to TJ's fabulous digs at Monticello and
Abe Lincoln's multi-columned memorial.
   Replacing them would be more contemporary designs on themes of
the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. The heads of JFK, FDR and
other presidents would still adorn the ``heads'' sides of coins,
but the likenesses would be updated.
   We've got no objection to modernizing things that need to be
modernized. But where's the hue and cry arising for modernized
coins? From coin collectors who don't have enough diversity?
   It's hard to understand why Congress, so laden down with real
money problems, must go out of its way to correct perceived money
problems. As harmless as it seems, redesigning coins does strange
things to the Americans psyche.
   If you don't buy that, then 300 million stockpiled Susan B.
Anthony silver dollars argue otherwise.

   The News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on Braniff's Chapter 11:
   Braniff Airlines is too much like the Phoenix that crashed in
flames, only to rise again from the ashes. Only this bird has tried
the same trick twice at the expense of consumers and employees.
   After leaving hundreds of customers stranded, after moving
hundreds of employees to Kansas City (Mo.), after laying off 2,700
employees, the airline says it expects to fly again despite its
filing for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11.
   Braniff fell victim to its own stupidity.
   The final proof came (Sept. 27) when airline officials simply
canceled all but four flights without explanation pending a
confirmation announcement that came (the next day).
   It is difficult to imagine, after such a repeat performance, why
anyone would trust Braniff for a future flight.

<TEXT>
   The Cabinet on Wednesday backed the
ban on burying Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines after the
defense chief reportedly warned legislators of threats against the
government.
   Also Wednesday, a government agency said it might help the
former president's widow, Imelda, with her legal problems if she
returns some assets acquired with money allegedly embezzled by
Marcos during his rule.
   Marcos, 72, died in Honolulu on Thursday. He had lived in exile
in Hawaii since he was ousted in a military-civilian uprising that
catapulted Corazon Aquino to power in February 1986.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow the body to be brought back
here for burial, citing possible civil unrest.
   Economic Planning Secretary Jesus Estanislao said Defense
Secretary Fidel Ramos told Cabinet members the country faced a
number of security risks if Marcos' body were returned.
   ``There are destabilization threats,'' Estanislao told The
Associated Press. ``He (Ramos) presented intelligence reports
including the possible assassination of the president.''
   Ramos refused to confirm or deny Estanislao's disclosure, saying
the briefing was ``highly classified.''
   Ramos said his department has been constantly receiving reports
about possible attempts against the government. He said the
20-year-old Communist insurgency remains the most serious threat.
   Marcos' followers have been linked to several of the six armed
attempts to topple Mrs. Aquino. But since Marcos' death,
demonstrations by his followers have been relatively small and
peaceful.
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court agreed to consider a petition from
Marcos' supporters to allow Marcos to be buried in his homeland and
to allow his widow and three children to attend. They also are
barred from entering the Philippines.
   In a speech Wednesday, Mrs. Aquino repeated her concerns about
allowing the Marcos family in.
   ``I know the threat that this man poses to the country I am
sworn to protect, yet I know the loneliness of exile and the pain
of being struck by death without setting foot on one's native
soil,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   Imelda Marcos has been banned from leaving the United States
pending her trial in New York in March on charges of embezzling
Philippine government money and investing some of it in the United
States. The Marcoses were indicted last October, and Mrs. Marcos is
free on $5 million bail.
   Augusto Villarin, a deputy chief of the Presidential Commission
on Good Government, said if Mrs. Marcos surrendered a substantial
portion of the ``hidden wealth,'' the government might intercede
with U.S. authorities to drop the charges.
   ``My common sense tells me that if the victim, which is the
Philippine government, has been satisfied that the stolen wealth
has been returned, maybe we can request the U.S. government to be
lenient,'' Villarin said.
   The commission was appointed to recover the estimated $10
billion the Marcoses allegedly stole during his 20-year rule.
Marcos denied the charges.

<HEAD>Two Leading Opposition Members Jail in Abortion Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two leading members of Burma's opposition
movement were ordered jailed for three years for allegedly
sheltering a man whose girlfriend had an illegal abortion, official
media reported Wednesday.
   The Working People's Daily said the opposition leaders, Win Tin
and Ngwe Hlaing, of the National League for Democracy, were accused
of sheltering 22-year-old Soe Thein.
   Soe, his girlfriend and two doctors who performed the abortion
have since been sentenced to 10 years in jail, the newspaper said.
   It said Soe and his girlfriend are members of the youth wing of
the National League for Democracy, the most popular opposition
group to emerge from a pro-democracy uprising last year.
   Win Tin was a member of the National League's nine-man central
executive committee, and Ngwe Hlaing was an organizer for the group
in Rangoon. They were arrested July 4.
   ``It is in keeping with the line that none are ever persecuted
for their political activities _ only for breaking the law in some
way _ that they have chosen to come down extremely savagely on an
alleged abortion,'' said a Rangoon-based Western diplomat in a
telephone interview from Bangkok. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Abortion is illegal in Burma, but prosecution has been rare.
   In July, the military government began a general clampdown on
the National League and other active opposition groups.
   On July 20, Aung San Suu Kyi, the general secretary of the
league, and its chairman, Tin Oo, were put under house arrest on
charges of subversion. Since then, Western diplomats say several
thousand other activists have been detained.
   The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon says that it has ``credible''
reports that many of those arrested have been tortured, some until
death.
   Gen. Saw Maung's government seized power in Sept. 1988 after a
series of bloody crackdowns on dissent.

   About 130 East Germans, some telling
desperate stories about swimming rivers and evading border police,
arrived at the West German embassy Wednesday seeking refuge and
passage to the West.
   The newcomers brought to about 400 the number of people waiting
in Poland for word on their bid to reach West Germany.
   A West German diplomat urged the refugees to be calm and not to
fear giving accurate information as they were registered, even
though some had crossed the border illegally.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said in a
radio interview that he expected Poland ``to keep its word not to
send any refugees back to the GDR (East Germany) against their
will.''
   An Interior Ministry spokesman said there were ``mass scale''
attempts by East Germans to enter Poland illegally and that border
guards had turned back some East Germans before they reached Poland.
   There have been no confirmed reports of East Germans being
handed back over to East Germany once they are on Polish soil.
   Many East Germans said they headed for Poland after learning the
border to Czechoslovakia had been closed. However, East Germans
need permits from their government to travel to Poland, and several
said these were now unavailable.
   Genscher said he expected a solution would be found for the
refugees in Poland, although none was announced when permission was
given Tuesday night for about 11,000 East Germans to leave Prague.
   When the two Germanys reached their first agreement about
refugees, about 800 left Poland for West Germany by train early
Sunday, following thousands of others from Prague.
   Among those waiting for a second solution to the crisis are some
who missed the weekend release by minutes.
   One father said that as his family drove up Sunday to learn they
were too late, ``We panicked. We didn't know what would be.''
   ``But we were sure we wouldn't go back,'' he said. ``And then it
turned out we were not alone.''
   Wednesday's arrivals huddled outside a kiosk near the West
German Embassy in a residential section of Warsaw, filling out
forms and waiting for buses to transport them to hotels 24 miles
from the capital.
   Some trembled in clothing wet from their overnight swim across
the Neisse and Oder rivers that form the border. An embassy
official brought a carload of blankets.
   Reports circulated of soldiers massing at the border, and some
refugees told of hiding from guards.
   Some said Polish border guards had chased refugees. Earlier
groups of East Germans had said Polish authorities appeared to make
little effort to stop the crossings.
   Col. Andrzej Sadlinski, the spokesman for the Interior Ministry,
confirmed that many East Germans had tried to cross the border
illegally. He said Poland was obligated to prevent such crossings.

   Statesman-Journal, Salem, Ore., on Dr. Elizabeth Morgan:
   It doesn't take a sharp legal mind to figure out that something
went wrong with our justice system when a mother who wouldn't tell
the court where her daughter is must spend more time in jail than
drug dealers and rapists.
   Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, (arguing that her ex-husband sexually
abused her 7-year old daughter), refused to produce Hilary for
court-ordered visits. Morgan (spent) 759 days in jail for contempt
of court.
   It took a public outcry and an act of Congress to free her. But
the case isn't finished, and she could be jailed again for
continuing to defy the court. ...
   The law that tries to force a person to obey legitimate legal
orders, especially when it involves a youngster, is sound. It's the
procedure and the judge's interpretation that are out of whack. ...
   Custodial interference cases of this sort demand a different
kind of justice and punishment. And now that Congress has seen the
injustice of sentencing Morgan to an indeterminate sentence ...
without a trial or a conviction, maybe it will change the laws on
contempt of court.

   Santa Barbara (Calif.) News-Press on education vs. apathy:
   When President Bush invited the nation's governors and educators
to Charlottesville, Va., last week to establish broad educational
goals, they were there _ along with 900 newspaper and television
reporters. It was a happening.
   Two weeks ago, when the Santa Barbara Council on Alcoholism and
Drug Abuse invited 7,500 parents to attend a presentation intended
to help them keep their children in school and out of the clutches
of chemical dependency, organizers were justifiably stunned and
bewildered when only 30 people attended. For them it was a poignant
moment _ a stark realization that this essential ingredient in the
formula for educational success is often missing.
   In convening the nation's governors for only the third time in
U.S. history, President Bush, who has vowed to be the ``education
president,'' implored parents to become full partners in the
education of their children. ...
   For the United States to regain its standing in a rapidly
changing world as the best and brightest, it will not be a measure
of George Bush or the 50 governors. It will be a measure of
individual commitment to do better.
   If Johnny can't read or write, or add and subtract, the solution
ultimately lies in the living room and the classroom with each and
every parent, student and teacher _ interested, engaged and
determined.

   Lawrence (Kan.) Journal-World on a national education curriculum:
   Gov. Mike Hayden (of Kansas) is on the right track with his
opposition to a national education curriculum. Some of the current
problems in the U.S. education system probably can be attributed to
an increasing lack of local control over schools.
   When teachers and administrators get too tied up with fulfilling
state mandates or measuring up to federal standards, they find it
harder and harder to provide the kind of education that may be
needed in their individual communities.
   To say that schools in inner-city Chicago should teach the same
classes that are taught in rural Baldwin (Kan.) is to ignore the
socio-economic and cultural differences that exist between those
two areas.

   A time bomb exploded in a crowded market
Wednesday and police said four people were killed, including three
members of a family involved in a land dispute.
   Police reported four other people wounded in the explosion in a
parking area at the Sadar Bazaar in northern New Delhi. Residents
of the area said 13 people were hurt.
   Those killed included the wife and two granddaughers, aged 4 and
8, of Abdul Razak, who operates the parking lot on the disputed
land. The fourth victim was a customer.
   At least four scooters in the lot were badly damaged and many
were spattered with blood.
   Razak, 65, his white T-shirt stained with blood, said the
bombing probably resulted from a land dispute with a neighboring
shopkeeper that has been in court more than 25 years.
   Police did not confirm the allegation, but a senior official
said they were ``investigating all angles.'' No arrests were
reported.
   Investigators searched the debris for clues and remnants of the
bomb, the police said.
   A senior officer at the site, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the bomb was put in a plastic jug wrapped in cloth
and hidden under a wooden platform where Razak's relatives were
sitting. A canvas thatch over the parking area was blown down when
the bomb went off just after 10 a.m.
   A member of the bomb disposal squad said: ``It was a crude bomb
but had a powerful blast.''

   Army engineers raised a bridge dangling
at a 45-degree angle in the water today in an effort to restore the
link to two islands cut off from the South Carolina mainland by
Hurricane Hugo 13 days ago.
   High tide this morning helped lift the 500,000-ton bridge, and
workers used a crane to restore it to its stand.
   Officials said they hoped to have the ends of the Ben Sawyer
Bridge connected to the road later in the day so that it could be
inspected and reopened to traffic Thursday to hurricane-devastated
Sullivan's Island and the Isle of Palms.
   Without the bridge, building and cleaning supplies have had to
be flown or ferried over in boats.
   ``The people just wanted to get back in their homes and get
started digging out,'' said Melvin Anderegg, mayor of Sullivan's
Island. ``Everywhere you look over there, people are cleaning up
and moving things.''
   The Coast Guard had to turn away dozens of boaters who filled
the waterway to watch the bridge repair. Officials nevertheless
were eager for the public to know that life is returning to normal
in an area that boasts 60 miles of beaches and attracted 10 million
visitors last year.
   More than 1,000 truckloads of debris a day are being removed
from Charleston, the city where the Civil War began.
   ``We've bounced back from Hurricane Hugo and visitors should not
cancel their plans to come to Charleston but should come right
ahead,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., who wore a T-shirt saying
``Charleston S.C. We're Going Strong.''
   The mayor said Tuesday that 90 percent of the city's hotels have
reopened, and a 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew should be lifted shortly.
   Criticism of federal relief efforts continued along with the
recovery.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., called for the General Accounting
Office, Congress' watchdog agency, to investigate the
``incompetent'' work of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   Hollings again complained that the agency has not opened enough
offices in the 22 South Carolina counties declared a federal
disaster area. There are about 10 offices opened in those areas.
   FEMA spokesman Bill McAda said he would welcome an
investigation, and said the agency was fulfilling its role of
aiding long-term recovery.
   ``I believe we're doing that and under the circumstances doing
it as fast as it can be expected to be done,'' he said.
   That view was seconded by Marilyn Quayle, the vice president's
wife, who helped at disaster and American Red Cross centers in
Charleston on Tuesday.
   ``From what I've been able to observe, FEMA, very frankly, got a
bum rap,'' she said.
   The agency has 350 workers in South Carolina to process
applications from people seeking low-interest loans and grants to
rebuild homes and businesses.
   Hurricane Hugo roared into the South Carolina coast Sept. 21,
leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless, 270,000 jobless, and a
swath of damage extending into North Carolina. In all, 29 people
were killed on the U.S. mainland.
   Damage in South Carolina alone has been estimated at at least $3
billion.
   In the community of Murrells Inlet about 10 miles south of
Myrtle Beach, author Mickey Spillane examined the wreckage of his
home and office, where he has written detective novels since 1963.
   One section of a wall was gone, and first editions of his books,
including ``I, The Jury,'' and ``My Gun is Quick,'' had
disappeared, as well as a manuscript in progress. But the author
wasn't too upset.
   ``Hey, not to worry,'' he said. ``I'll make (the manuscript) up
in two weeks, ... maybe three. That's how long it takes to write a
book.''

   President Saddam Hussein was so shocked by
the dirty bathroom and dirty towels in a district governor's office
that he fired him, an official announcement said Wednesday.
   ``If the governor himself is not clean and tidy, how will we
manage to raise the standard of our people,'' Saddam was heard
saying on television earlier in the week while visiting the office
of the governor of Darbandikhan, 188 miles northeast of Baghdad.
   He was shown at the time inspecting the private bathroom in the
office of the governor, Mustafa Fatah.
   Television viewers heard Saddam angrily rebuking Fatah because
the facility and the towels were dirty and declaring that the
government would fire any governor who failed to look after his
district's hygiene.
   A decree issued Wednesday by the ruling Revolutionary Command
Council confirmed Fatah's early retirement and demotion to a lower
grade pension.

   Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko and
President Bush met today in efforts to bolster the faltering truce
accord between Angola's government and its U.S.-armed opposition.
   Mobutu, in New York to attend the United Nations General
Assembly, made a quick trip to Washington for the meeting as part
of intensive behind-the-scenes U.S. efforts to prevent the collapse
of the agreement reached through Zairean mediation in June.
   The two leaders met for nearly 45 minutes. Mobutu declined to
answer reporters' questions as he left the White House.
   Also in Washington today were Jonas Savimbi, the rebel who leads
the Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and Pedro
van Dunem, the foreign minister of Angola's Soviet-backed
government.
   U.S. officials have ruled out a meeting among all three sides
but not a possible reconciliation meeting between Savimbi and
Mobutu. Savimbi is scheduled to meet Bush on Thursday.
   Mobutu, who has served as the major conduit of an estimated $40
million in U.S. arms and other supplies to UNITA annually, is
supporting the Angolan government's interpretation of the June
accords. President Eduardo dos Santos contends Savimbi agreed to
temporary exile and to integrating his forces into the Angolan
armed forces.
   At a news conference here Wednesday, Van Dunem accused Savimbi
of not being ``willing really to commit himself to a process of
peace.'' He told reporters the United States should support the
agreement reached last June, including Savimbi's exile and the
integration of his forces into the government military.
   Van Dunem said he had conveyed these thoughts to members of the
House of Representatives subcommittee on Africa and would tell
secretary of state James Baker the same thing when he meets him,
probably next week.
   On Tuesday, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. complained at a hearing of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Mobutu had cut the flow
of U.S. arms to Savimbi's forces, asking Herman J. Cohen, assistant
secretary of state for African affairs, why that had been done.
   Cohen said that while it was an ``open secret'' that the United
States has been aiding Savimbi in his struggle against Angola's
Marxist government, details of the operation are classified.
   Helms said his question was not based on classified material and
added: ``I can say publicly that the supply lines have been cut and
you and I know why and who did it.'' Helms asserted that ``Mobutu
got his hackles up because Savimbi wouldn't knuckle under'' to the
terms of the peace plan.
   This week, both sides are currying U.S. support in meetings with
administration officials, members of Congress and the media.
   Savimbi is arguing for continued U.S. aid _ he already gets one
of the largest sums of covert assistance _ and for support of free
elections that would allow UNITA to share power.
   Angola is asking primarily for U.S. recognition, arguing that it
has fulfilled Washington's main demand by agreeing to the
withdrawal of more than 50,000 Cuban troops by 1991. U.S. officials
say the Cuban pullout from Angola is proceeding as planned but that
diplomatic recognition will be withheld until the government agrees
to free elections.
   Angola is backed by a coalition of advocacy groups that has
organized media briefings and demonstrations against Savimbi this
week.
   Half-page ads this week in The Washington Post and The New York
Times, paid for by the Angolan government, said Savimbi was a
``dictator'' here to press for more covert aid.
   UNITA is represented by a prestigious array of lobbyists and
public relations experts.
   UNITA supporters on Tuesday released the content of a letter
written by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asking Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to investigate a major Angola supporter, the TransAfrica
lobbying organization.
   Hatch said TransAfrica may have violated the Foreign Agents
Registration Act by accepting more than $2,000 from the Angolan
mission to the United Nations.
   Randall Robinson, the director of TransAfrica who just returned
from a fact-finding trip to Angola, said the money went to buy
tickets for the organization's annual dinner in which some 50
African and Caribbean countries took part.
   A Justice Department spokesman said the Hatch request had been
forwarded to the Criminal Division.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega patrolled quiet streets today after crushing a coup
attempt, and a military spokesman said two coup leaders had taken
refuge at a U.S. Army base.
   A lawyer for Noriega said the general was not detained or
injured in Tuesday's uprising and had been away from the Defense
Forces headquarters in Panama City when the fighting began.
   It was the second failed attempt in 18 months by dissidents in
the military to oust Noriega, the Defense Forces chief and de facto
leader of Panama.
   Noriega was quick to blame the revolt on the United States,
which has been trying to oust him for more than 1{ years and bring
him to the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges.
   ``The proof is that American troops closed access routes to the
barracks, just as they closed the Pan-American Highway,'' Noriega
said on nationwide television several hours after the failed coup
by what appeared to be a small group of soldiers.
   At the United Nations in New York today, Panama's president,
Francisco Rodriguez, also claimed that U.S. troops blocked roads
during the attempted coup. ``There is proof, evidence of all kinds
that there was such support which the U.S. armed forces in Panama
gave,'' he told reporters. He said photographs will be released
later showing U.S. tanks blocking the highways.
   Raul Ossa, the second vice president of the opposition Christian
Democrats, was arrested following the coup attempt, according to a
telex the party sent today to Panamanian exiles in Miami. The
statement did not say precisely when the arrest occurred or whether
it was part of a larger roundup.
   A Defense Forces spokesman, Maj. Edgardo Lopez, said two coup
leaders, including Capt. Javier Licona, head of the Cavalry
Squadron, had taken refuge at Fort Clayton, a U.S. Army base in
Panama City. In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman said he was unable
to confirm Lopez's account.
   President Bush denied any role in the rebellion, but he
reiterated that the United States would still like to see Noriega
ousted.
   ``I want to see democracy in Panama succeed,'' Bush said in
Washington Tuesday night. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said the Bush administration had some advance word that a coup
attempt might be afoot.
   Some U.S. congressional leaders said the United States should
have helped the rebels.
   ``Once again we have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,
and I think it's an outrage,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States
reserves the right to use force against Noriega, but he dismissed
``armchair generals'' who criticized the administration's response.
   Noriega was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in the
United States in February 1988, but he maintains those charges are
part of a U.S. plot to keep possession of the Panama Canal, which
reverts to Panama at the end of the century.
   He also annulled May elections after international observers
said his slate of candidates had lost by a landslide.
   The coup attempt began at the headquarters of the Defense Forces
at about 7 a.m. Tuesday, with the sound of gunshots and explosions
echoing through the poor, crowded downtown neighborhood. Police,
armored personnel carriers and water cannons blocked the
surrounding streets. Some residents grabbed their belongings and
ran.
   Sporadic shooting continued for several hours and the rebels
read a communique on national radio saying they had toppled
Noriega. Loyalist troops later surrounded the headquarters compound
and more fighting broke out.
   Noriega was away from headquarters at the time, said Raymond
Takiff, one of several attorneys in Miami representing Noriega on
drug charges. Takiff said he spoke with Lopez today by telephone
while Noriega stood at Lopez's side.
   Coup leaders ``knew he was not (there), so why they moved is a
mystery,'' Takiff quoted Lopez as saying.
   U.S. troops moved into position only a few hundred yards from
the fighting and temporarily closed the main bridge over the canal,
but U.S. spokesmen said those were only security measures.
   The U.S. troops did not take part in the fighting.
   About 50,000 Americans live in Panama, including more than
12,000 U.S. military personnel attached to the U.S. Southern
Command.
   The United States never considered kidnapping Noriega, said a
top Pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``When it appeared as through Noriega might have been dethroned
... there were several options considered, none of which involved
going in and getting him.'' He declined to say exactly what options
were weighed.
   The pro-government newspaper Critica said six members of the
Defense Forces died in the coup attempt. Defense Forces spokesman
Lopez would say only that a number of soldiers were wounded and
refused to be more specific.
   Former opposition vice presidential candidate Guillermo Ford
said at a New York news conference that Noriega was not getting any
stronger despite the crushing of the coup.
   ``The mere fact that a group of officers, young officers, have
attempted to overthrow him, in my opinion, is important enough that
he must be getting the message loud and clear,'' Ford said.
   Although Ford reported some civilian discontent, he also
admitted it was quickly put down. ``I personally believe, and I say
this with a lot of sorrow, that the Panamanian people are highly
intimidated by the regime,'' said Ford, who was beaten bloody by
thugs during a demonstration after his ticket won the May 7
elections.
   Tuesday's coup attempt was more serious than a failed coup on
March 16, 1988, but it appeared that only elements of the Urraca
battalion, which is in charge of security at Defense Forces
headquarters, were involved.
   Although the rebel's only communique was signed by the battalion
commander, Maj. Moises Giraldi Vega, Lopez said ``more than 60''
soldiers and four or five officers were being held prisoner, far
less than a full battalion.
   Noriega controls the country through his command of the Defense
Forces, and the failure of any other units to respond to the rebel
call served to underline his control.
   ``Absolutely all'' other Defense Forces officers remained loyal
to Noriega, according Lopez.
   That loyalty was visible in the swift reaction by the elite
Battalion 2000 and Macho de Monte units, which moved into Panama
City to put down the uprising from bases respectively 25 and 55
miles away.
   At one point the rebels announced by radio that they had ousted
Noriega, and a few hundred members of the civilian opposition went
into the streets to celebrate. But within half an hour Noriega
loyalists replied that the rebels were bluffing, and the good cheer
faded.

   Eight Pakistani sailors were
rescued by an Indian crew after jumping into the Persian Gulf to
escape their flaming cargo ship, the vessel's owners said Wednesday.
   The wooden 450-ton Jameel was gutted by the blaze, its owner,
Sultan Ahmed Hareb, said.
   The Orient Pride, owned by the Indian Orient Express line,
picked up the sailors Tuesday, 12 hours after the Jameel caught
fire, Hareb said. It brought them to the southern gulf port of
Dubai.
   The fire broke out after the Dubai-registered Jameel experienced
engine problems in the Gulf of Oman. It was returning home with a
cargo of fertilizer and onions from Karachi.
   The U.A.E. coast guard was expected to start a search Wednesday
for the remains of the $400,000 vessel, Hareb said.

   Fire engulfed part of a historic hotel being
restored in central London today and one fireman was injured when a
section of roof collapsed, the Fire Brigade said.
   Firemen called off a search for two plumbers after they were
found outside the building, said a brigade spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   One hundred firefighters and more than 15 fire trucks with
aerial ladders tired to control the blaze at the old Langham Hotel.
The top four floors and roof of the 10-story building were ablaze,
and it took two hours to put out the fire, the spokesman said.
   One firemen was taken to University College Hospital with a
possible broken leg after part of the roof collapsed while he was
inside, the spokesman said.
   The Langham Hotel on Portland Place, built in 1864, was the
forerunner of London's grand hotels, constructed in the style of a
Florentine palace with plaster-relief ceilings and mosaic flooring
by Italian craftsmen.
   More than 2,000 people attended the gala opening including the
future King Edward VII. The hotel remained a favorite of the rich
and famous including the exiled French emperor Napoleon III,
Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini and American author Mark Twain.
   Between World War I and World War II, as the center of
fashionable London moved west and more luxury hotels were built,
the Langham declined in popularity but still retained many of its
aristocratic patrons.
   It suffered extensive damage in 1940 from a German land mine and
was forced to close. It is now being refurbished as a 400-bed hotel
and conference center.

   The Agriculture Department said Wednesday that
the net income of farm cooperatives last year rose to nearly $1.7
billion, continuing a rebound from the sharp declines of the
mid-1980s.
   Combined business volume of cooperatives in 1988 was reported at
$66.3 billion, up 10.3 percent from $60.2 billion in 1987. The
record was $73 billion in 1984.
   The $1.7 billion for net income was up 13 percent from $1.5
billion in 1987 and was almost two-and-a-half times the 1986 level
of $688 million. Last year's net income was exceeded only by $1.9
billion in 1980 and $1.8 billion in 1976.
   Randall E. Torgerson, administrator of the department's
Agricultural Cooperative Service, attributed the 1988 growth
primarily to drought-induced higher prices for grains, oil-bearing
crops and feed. Production of feed grains and soybeans dropped
sharply because of last year's drought.
   Total cooperative business volume includes the value of products
sold by marketing co-ops; the sales of farm supplies such as
fertilizer, chemicals, fuels and feed to members and other
customers; and receipts from services such as trucking, storage,
ginning and drying.
   Despite business increase, the total number of co-ops and
members continued a long-time downward trend in 1988.
   Torgerson said the number of co-ops dropped to 4,939 from 5,109
primarily as the result of reorganizations through mergers,
consolidations and acquisitions. Memberships totaled 4.19 million,
down 5.6 percent from 1987.
   The number of co-op memberships is larger than the number of
farms in the United States _ less than 2.2 million _ because many
farmers belong to more than one cooperative. Memberships averaged
848 per association, compared with 869 in 1987.

<HEAD>Thatcher Says Britain Won't Take Millions of Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Wednesday
that it is impossible for Britain to take in millions of refugees
from Hong Kong, and she urged China to take steps to reassure the
colony.
   That confidence was shaken by the crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing last June, she said, and ``it's really up
to the Chinese government do everything they can to take the
requisite action to restore that confidence.''
   Answering questions at a meeting with foreign journalists, Mrs.
Thatcher said: ``We are looking at a scheme to have some people
from Hong Kong, but it couldn't be anything like the total
number... There is no question of that.''
   ``There will be some key people who it is important should stay
in Hong Kong to keep the prosperity and security going,'' she said.
   Hong Kong is to revert to Chinese rule in 1997.

<HEAD>Haig Recommends Increased Western Contacts With China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Alexander M. Haig Jr., a former U.S. secretary of
state, said Wednesday the West must not drive China into isolation,
and recommended that a freeze on new credit be lifted.
   Haig, the most prominent American to visit China since the army
crackdown on pro-democracy protests June 3-4, said meetings with
Chinese leaders reassured him China is serious about keeping its
doors open to the world.
   ``Regardless of your point of view,'' Haig said in an interview
shortly before his departure, ``we simply must continue to
communicate with Chinese leaders.''
   While in Beijing for a business symposium, Haig met with Premier
Li Peng, President Yang Shangkun and Jiang Zemin, the new Communist
Party chief. He spoke briefly with senior leader Deng Xiaoping on
the rostrum of Tiananmen Gate.
   Haig, who heads a private consulting firm, said the ``overriding
imperative'' of Western governments now ``is to avoid driving China
into resentful and angry isolation.''
   He praised President Bush for showing ``restraint on excessive
overreaction'' but said the time had come to reconsider the policy,
backed by most Western countries and Japan, of freezing action on
new credit by such international lending institutes as the World
Bank.
   Withholding of new loans ``could affect the people of China,''
he said, and ``I don't think that should be restrained too much
longer.''
   Most Western nations have halted high-level official contacts
and suspended arms sales, as well as cutting off new credit, to
show their outrage over the Chinese government's violent
suppression of dissent.
   The former secretary of state said the message to China should
be: ``We were mad, we reacted, but we've got to go on.''
   Haig said Chinese-American contacts, resumed 18 years ago, have
been ``fundamentally advantageous'' to world peace and regional
stability.
   U.S. businesses must assess the risks of investing in China,
which in addition to political turmoil is undergoing an economic
austerity program to combat excessive growth and serious gaps
between supply and demand, Haig said.
   He added, referring to businesses already here: ``I would not
advise them to pick up stakes and pull out. ... I still think
there's a lot of good business to be done in China.''
   Noting that 20-25 percent of China's gross national product is
directly related to international commerce, Haig said: ``Even if
there were an intention to reverse that, it could not be done
without serious repercussions, which I don't think any leadership
in China would risk.''
   China blames the United States for the current strain in
relations, contending that a nation's relations with others should
not be affected by its domestic policies.

   A man was awakened when a stranger jumped
into his bed and police followed to yank the intruder out.
   ``Basically, I think the guy was just trying to hide,'' said
Officer Tim McCarty. The man did not know the people in the house,
authorities said.
   Officer K.J. Winger stopped the man's car for speeding early on
Monday. When the man was unable to produce a driver's license or
identification, the officer asked him to step into his squad car.
   Instead, the man ran.
   Winger gave chase, and McCarty saw the man trying to enter the
house. He grabbed at the man, but the man pushed his way into the
house, McCarty said.
   The woman who owns the house said the stranger ran through
several rooms before charging up a staircase and into her
20-year-old son's room. The startled resident looked on as police
pulled the man out of bed.
   The man was arrested on a charge of burglary because he entered
the home without permission, McCarty said.

<HEAD>Nibbling, Not Gorging, Good for Cholesterol Level</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Release at 6 p.m. EDT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to holding down cholesterol, when
you eat may turn out to be as important as what you eat.
   A study has found that people who nibble all day instead of
eating three square meals have signficantly lower blood cholesterol
levels.
   The researchers said this means that cholesterol levels ``may be
lowered by increasing meal frequency alone, with no alteration in
the nature or amount of the food eaten.''
   However, they said they did not advocate putting people on the
diet they tested, which they described as ``an extreme model of
nibbling.''
   In the study, conducted at the University of Toronto, seven men
ate 2,500 calories a day. For one two-week period, they got their
food in three ordinary-size meals. But for another two weeks, they
got the same amount of calories in 17 snacks eaten once an hour.
   The nibbling diet lowered their total cholesterol levels by 9
percent and their levels of hazardous low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, or LDL, by 14 percent.
   Nutritionists generally discourage people from eating this way,
because snackers tend to take in more calories over the course of
the day and put on weight. However, some population studies suggest
that those who eat frequently rather than gorging on one or two
meals a day have healthier hearts.
   The researchers said that what they found ``is consistent with
the claim that increasing meal frequency while maintaining a
constant caloric intake may have a role in the prevention of heart
disease.''
   Why this might be is unclear. The researchers speculated that
nibbling might somehow help by lowering insulin levels or prompting
the liver to make less cholesterol.
   The study, directed by Dr. David J.A. Jenkins, was published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.

takeover laws; PICKS UP 12th graf pvs, `This summer ...'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state seized control of Jersey City's
28,000-student school system today, making it the biggest urban
district in the nation to be taken over for failing to do its job.
   State officials charged that the school system in the gritty,
impoverished community across the Hudson River from New York City
is academically bankrupt and rife with corruption, mismanagement
and patronage.
   At least four other states have school takeover laws, and two _
New Mexico and Kentucky _ have seized districts deemed failures.
   The state Board of Education gave final approval to the takeover
and appointed Elena J. Scambio to a three-year term as
superintendent. Under New Jersey law, the state has five years to
make improvements.
   The move gives the state extraordinary power in Jersey City, the
state's second-largest district and the first to be taken over by
the state. Ms. Scambio can fire administrators, abolish the local
board of education and set policy.
   The Jersey City school system has a staff of 3,322 and a budget
for the current year of about $180 million.
   Enrollment is 44 percent black, 34 percent Hispanic and 13
percent white. Fifty-five percent of the students are involved in
compensatory, bilingual or special education programs.
   Today's decision was expected and ends a long process that was
strongly pushed by Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who has billed himself
``the education governor.''
   Ms. Scambio, who will give up her job as Essex County schools
superintendent, has vowed to make Jersey City a national model of
urban education. But her immediate plans were unclear.
   State board Vice President Robert A. Woodruff, reading a
resolution, said the district's problems were ``deep-rooted and
endemic. The Jersey City board of education totally failed to meet
its obligations.''
   There are ``severe long-standing, deep-rooted deficiencies
permeating all aspects of the school system,'' the resolution said.
   The state had cited political intrusion in hiring, poor test
scores, failure to provide a safe and clean environment, violations
of bidding laws, failure to provide for handicapped children and
unauthorized use of funds.
   ``The idea of takeover does not come easily to me,'' said
Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman. ``I've always believed the
role of the state department is to help others help themselves.''
   Cooperman said the state is initiating the takeover ``not
because we want to. It's because we have to. If not us, who? If not
now, when?''
   National education groups say they will closely monitor the
takeover.
   Jean McDonald, a researcher for the National Governors
Association, said Kentucky, South Carolina, Texas and New Mexico
have laws allowing state takeovers of failing districts.
   She said laws in Illinois and Arkansas let the state eliminate
deficient districts, an Ohio law allows the state to revoke a
troubled district's charter and Georgia may impose heavy financial
penalties on such districts.
   This summer, an administrative law judge agreed state officials
had the power to take over the district. He noted that some of the
district's textbooks are more than 30 years old.
   Jersey City officials bitterly fought the takeover, saying the
problems were caused by a prior administration and that the state
trumped up its case against the district.
   Opponents also question whether the state can improve conditions
in Jersey City, saying New Jersey's system of funding schools has
crippled urban districts.

<HEAD>`Simple Little Bill' Now Loaded Down With Tax Goodies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It began as a simple little bill to reduce the
budget deficit by $5.3 billion. But as Tuesday night faded into
Wednesday morning, the bill ballooned into a multibillion-dollar
package of tax goodies for a parade of special interests.
   It was tax time at the Senate Finance Committee and there were a
lot of winners: lower-income parents, some of the nation's
wealthiest retirees, oil producers, owners of tuxedo rental
companies, timber growers, banana farmers, rural hospitals,
first-time homebuyers, the self-employed, parents who adopt
handicapped children.
   And, of course, workers who want to use Individual Retirement
Accounts to shelter income from the taxman. In the biggest fight of
the day, liberalized IRAs, favored by most Democrats, won out over
a cut in capital-gains taxes, which Republicans preferred.
   That issue will be fought another day on the floor of the
Senate, perhaps as early as Friday.
   When the deficit-reduction bill with all its attached amendments
is debated by the Senate, Republicans will try to strike the IRA
provision and substitute a capital-gains cut for individuals and
corporations. They failed by a 10-10 tie vote to do that in
committee.
   The GOP plan provides that, the longer an individual held a
piece of property, stock or other investment, the less of the
profit would be taxed when sold. For example, 95 percent of the
profit from property sold after a year would be taxed; 70 percent
would be taxed if sold after six years.
   That plan is patterned after President Bush's proposal but
considerably different from the one that the House, with Bush's
endorsement, adopted last week.
   However the fight over capital gains and IRAs is decided _ and
the final bill could contain parts of both _ most of the direct tax
saving would go to people with incomes above $50,000 a year.
   While those issues will command the attention of the Senate,
many other parts of the big deficit-reduction bill will not even be
mentioned in public debate.
   ``This bill as it has progressed has become increasingly more
troubling,'' Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., groused as the panel wound
up action on the legislation just before 2:30 a.m. Wednesday. ``We
end up raising $37 billion (in taxes over five years) to meet a
$5.3 billion'' deficit-reduction goal, he said.
   Here are some of the scores of provisions that were tacked onto
the bill by the committee:
   _New assistance to rural hospitals, many of which are
financially stressed because federal Medicare reimbursements favor
urban facilities.
   _Expanding the oil-depletion allowance for owners of wells that
produce fewer than 15 barrels a day. Producers whose natural gas is
in ``tight sand'' formations would get an additional incentive
totaling $685 million over five years.
   _Permitting banana and pineapple growers to use a more
advantageous system of accounting, a $25 million benefit.
   _A liberalized package of tax-related aid to lower-income
families with children, including a new credit for health insurance
and supplements for families with children under age 4.
   _Raising from the current $8,880 to $14,520 the annual amount a
person age 65 through 69 may earn without losing a portion of
Social Security benefits. This would help fewer than 10 percent of
beneficiaries _ those whose earnings exceed $8,800 _ at a cost of
$1 billion a year.
   _Reducing from five years to two years the minimum time period
over which owners of rental tuxedo firms may depreciate their
inventories, saving owners $29 million over five years.
   _Permitting deduction of certain costs of adopting hard-to-place
children.
   _Extending through 1991 expiring tax benefits for employer-paid
legal and educational assistance, and for health insurance costs
for the self-employed; and making permanent credits designed to
help first-time homebuyers, corporations that increase research
spending and investors in low-income rental housing.
   _Restoring the income-averaging benefit for farmers; they could
use losses from bad years to offset taxes owed in good years.
   _Allowing timber growers to avoid a 1986 requirement that they
``materially participate'' in managing a timber crop before using
losses from such activity to offset taxes on other income.
   _Granting amnesty from 1985 backward to taverns that have failed
to pay an annual occupational tax.
   _Allowing the use of tax-exempt bonds to construct private spots
stadiums.
   _Requiring the Social Security Administration to mail annual
statements of earnings and benefits to all people 60 and older,
starting in 1995. Beginning in 1999, annual statements would have
to be mailed to every worker.
   _Ensuring that the Internal Revenue Service notify taxpayers who
are entitled to refunds but neglect to claim them.

   Apparently following the call of the
not-so-wild, coyotes are being sighted in New York City's northern
suburbs, officials say.
   Anthony Cazzari, supervisor of the town of Kent, said Tuesday
night that when he walked out of his house that morning, he found
``a strange-looking dog'' staring at him.
   On a second look, he said, he realized there was a coyote in his
yard. He ran inside to get a camera but the animal was gone when he
came out.
   Coyotes are small wolves native to America's western prairies.
They grow up to 4 feet long.
   The supervisor said police told him they had seen coyotes in the
Gypsy Trail and Farmers Mills sections of town and two coyotes were
killed by cars in the last few nights.
   Cazzari said no one had been attacked, but said residents should
be careful.

<HEAD>Group Says Western Export Policies Sometimes Hurt Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new educational group said Wednesday that
the agricultural export policies of the United States and the
European Economic Community are linked to Third World development,
sometimes to the disadvantage of poor countries.
   The Trade and Development Program was recently established to
help educate Americans about the importance of farm and trade
policy to the Third World.
   ``We all need to make these vital connections between our food,
farmers and trade policy,'' said the program's chairman, Walter
Grazer of the U.S. Catholic Conference. ``Education of our citizens
is critical, so they can make informed decisions and join in the
policy process.''
   The non-profit, Washington-based program is sponsored by 10
church and farm organizations and is funded by a grant from the
W.K. Kellogg Foundation.
   Educational materials, including video tapes, have been prepared
for use by farm, church and community groups to ``explore the
linkages'' between trade policies and Third World development.
   Atherton Martin, former agriculture minister of the Commonwealth
of Dominica, a Caribbean island nation, said measures to help U.S.
and European farmers, such as export subsidies on grains, have
damaged the fragile economies of developing countries.
   The export push was stepped up by the 1985 farm law, in which
Congress created export ``incentives'' or subsidies to sell more
U.S. commodities overseas, partly in response to similar incentives
in Europe, he said.
   As a result, the subsidized lower prices have helped consumers
but often have hurt farmers and slowed agricultural development in
many nations, Martin said.
   In a report outlining its goals and some of the challenges, the
program said no attempt will be made to reach a consensus or to
advocate specific trade and agricultural policies. However, it said
sponsors share a number of views:
   _Agricultural trade policies should be more sensitive to the
interests of farmers, farm workers, consumers and poor people
throughout the world.
   _Broad participation in community, national and international
decision making is crucial.
   _Individual and community stewardship, supported by sound public
policies, is critical in the care and preservation of global
resources.
   The common goals also state that ``maintaining U.S. family
farmers and vital rural communities is important to the fabric of
the nation'' and that these are important resources throughout the
world.
   ``Moderate-sized farms, development projects or trading
enterprises are generally preferable to large-scale undertakings,''
the report said.
   The sponsors are Bread for the World Institute on Hunger and
Development, the Center for Rural Affairs, the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America, the Friends Committee on National Legislation
Educational Fund, the National Catholic Rural Life Conference, the
National Farmers Organization, the National Farmers Union, the
National Grange, the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the U.S.
Catholic Conference.

<TEXT>
   PERTH-ANDOVER, New Brunswick (AP) _ A U.S. Air Force tanker jet
exploded in the air just above the American border today, killing
at least three crewmen, authorities said. The fourth crewman was
missing and feared dead.
   ``I've never seen anything like it _ it was like fireworks,''
said Paul McNally, a resident who said he saw the explosion before
dawn.
   The KC-135 was returning to Loring Air Force Base in Limestone,
Maine, from a refueling mission when it went down around 6 a.m. and
set woods on fire near Perth-Andover, a community of about 1,900,
the Air Force said.
   Loring spokeswoman Capt. Kellie Rebscher said that the plane
exploded in the air and that a military-civilian panel would seek
to determine the cause.
   Rebscher said the crew had been in radio contact with the Loring
control tower minutes before the explosion but gave no indication
of trouble. She said the plane had no ``black box'' cockpit voice
recorder.
   Three crewmen were confirmed dead, and a search was on for the
fourth, said Air Force Sgt. Darlene Bailey. The Air Force said in a
tape-recorded statement that there was a ``low probability of any
survivors.''
   The KC-135 Stratotanker is a Boeing 707 reconfigured as a tanker
for refueling fighters and bombers in the air. It has no ejection
mechanism, but has emergency exits.
   Rebscher said she did not know how much fuel the plane was
carrying or its altitude at the time of the explosion.
   ``The noise! My whole house shook _ windows and everything,''
said Anita Davenport, who lives across from the crash site.
   Ray Gamblin, who owns the woods where the debris landed, said he
was on the scene in less than five minutes and saw no sign of
survivors or parachutes.
   He said chunks of twisted metal and other debris were scattered
over a half-mile radius around his farm.
   ``The flight pattern goes right over our house all the time,''
he said. ``If it had been a few seconds later, it would have been
right in our yard probably.''
   Sgt. Charlton Ritchie, a Loring spokesman, said the four crewmen
were experienced and were training to keep their skills sharp.
   An Alaska National Guard KC-135 exploded and burned Sept. 20 at
Eielson Air Force Base, killing two people. On Jan. 31, all 19
people aboard a KC-135 died when it crashed on takeoff from Dyess
Air Force Base in Texas. A KC-135 crash in 1988 killed six crewmen
at Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Michigan.

<TEXT>
   It isn't tough to find a lawyer in Rhode
Island _ the state bar association says there's one for every 265
residents. But for people in jail, waiting two years or more for a
trial, criminal defense lawyers are almost an endangered species.
   Around the country, those involved in the criminal justice
system say the story is the same: Lawyers are fleeing criminal
defense work for more lucrative business, letting defendants
languish in jail while the overworked attorneys who remain in the
field are tied up on other matters.
   ``It's very difficult, when one lawyer has 60 cases, to dispose
of those cases when he's on trial for two or three months'' in one
of them, said Thomas F. Fay, chief justice of the Rhode Island
Supreme Court.
   Samuel Dash, former chief counsel to the Senate Watergate
committee and now a Georgetown University professor, chaired an
American Bar Association committee studying problems in the
nation's criminal court system.
   ``The system is entirely snarled. There are not enough defense
lawyers, prosecutors, police officers and judges,'' he said.
   And more lawyers might give up their defense work, especially in
drug cases, because the U.S. Supreme Court said the government may
seize lawyers' fees if the money came from their clients' illegal
drug sales, said Neal Sonnett, president of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
   ``A lot of lawyers find themselves not litigating in defense of
their client, but in defense of their own fees,'' Sonnett said.
``I've had lawyer after lawyer tell me they just don't want the
hassle.''
   Too few criminal lawyers can lead to hasty and poorly conceived
plea bargains that let dangerous criminals go free, or repeated
trial delays that keep people in overcrowded prisons, Dash said.
   James Ryan, chief of criminal prosecution in the Rhode Island
attorney general's office, said victims also become more reluctant
to testify as time passes, leading to more dismissed cases.
   Sixty-seven felony cases went to trial in 1988 in Providence
County, which contains 60 percent of the state's population. The
average time between indictment and verdict was 863 days, or 2.3
years, Ryan said.
   The state Supreme Court in 1987 unanimously overturned a robbery
conviction because a 2{-year delay caused largely by a cumbersome
court scheduling system had robbed the defendant of his
constitutional right to a speedy trial.
   Fay said the lawyer shortage is the main source of delays now
that the scheduling system has been changed.
   The United States has 725,574 actively practicing lawyers,
according to the ABA, or approximately one for every 340 people.
Sonnett estimated fewer than 50,000 of them are defense lawyers,
including public defenders.
   No one keeps tabs on how many of Rhode Island's 3,700 lawyers do
criminal defense work, but several lawyers estimated the state has
fewer than 20 private defense attorneys plus 32 in the public
defender's office.
   Low salaries, unpredictable hours and a lack of social status
all drive young law school graduates away from criminal work, Rhode
Island defense lawyers say.
   Edwards &amp; Angell, Rhode Island's largest corporate law firm,
pays newly minted lawyers $55,000 a year, and some New York firms
offer more than $80,000.
   The public defender's office, where many criminal defense
lawyers begin their careers, pays slightly under $30,000, said
Public Defender Richard M. Casparian.
   Indigent Rhode Island defendants are represented by
court-appointed private lawyers if the public defender cannot take
their cases because of a conflict of interest. Lawyers said those
appointments would be a good way to help young defense attorneys
get started if the fees _ $20 an hour out of court and $30 an hour
in court _ were not so low.
   ``There are plumbers who make more than that,'' said defense
lawyer John A. MacFadyen.
   Criminal lawyers also find their lives subject to unpredictable
schedules of witnesses, lawyers and judges to a much greater extent
than civil lawyers, said lawyer Peter A. DiBiase.
   ``You've got to get the court's permission to take a day off,''
he said.
   Criminal work also carries the stigma of guilt by association.
Pawtucket Mayor Brian J. Sarault, a former defense lawyer, spent
part of his re-election campaign this year deflecting questions
about a 9-year-old state police affidavit linking him to two drug
suspects he once represented.
   ``Who wants to dirty themselves by going out to the prison or
representing someone who's accused of some heinous crime?'' said
John F. Cicilline, defense attorney in several high-profile
organized crime cases.

<TEXT>
   About 10,000 East German refugees
began leaving Prague for the West today, and thousands of others
reportedly lined the train route hoping to join their historic
exodus.
   On Tuesday, for the second time in a week, East Germany's
Communist leaders agreed to safe passage to the West for thousands
of its citizens who had thronged West Germany's Embassy in Prague,
the capital.
   Later in the day, the leaders banned unrestricted travel into
Czechoslovakia in a desperate bid to stop the embarrassing exodus.
   Fourteen buses carrying the East Germans from the embassy
compound to Prague's Lieben train station left about 4:30 p.m.
   The first train carrying 1,000 East Germans departed Prague
about two hours later, reporters at the station said.
   Fifteen trains were made available by the East German state
railroad for the transfer. The trains were to travel through East
German territory via Dresden to the West German border town of Hof.
   The trains were originally scheduled to leave earlier today, but
they were repeatedly delayed. One report suggested that was because
would-be emigres were jamming train stations along the route,
hoping to join the mass transfer.
   The Prague refugees waited through Tuesday night in near
freezing weather, huddled in and around the embassy, many in tents
on the embassy garden, which is roughly the size of a football
field.
   ``We couldn't survive a second night like this,'' said a Red
Cross official, who requested anonymity.
   In Communist East Berlin, police scuffled today with 50 East
Germans attempting to gain entry to the U.S. Embassy, witnesses
said. Earlier, officials said 18 East Germans entered the embassy
seeking passage to the West. Witnesses said about 100 East German
police scuffled with the would-be refugees in front of the embassy.
There were no reports of injuries. Witnesses said police also
cleared the area of 200 bystanders.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of
the situation at the U.S. Embassy: ``We're talking to the East
Germans about it and trying to get them to help resolve the problem
through their emigration policies.''
   Diplomatic sources also said that four East Germans were seeking
asylum in the West German mission in East Berlin.
   There were reports that thousands of would-be emigres in East
Germany were lining the route that trains carrying the refugees
from Czechoslovakia were to travel en route to West Germany.
   Hungarian radio said the railroad station in Dresden, East
Germany, was jammed with hundreds of people hoping to jump aboard
the special trains but that East German police cleared the station.
   However, in Frankfurt, the Hessische Rundfunk radio said young
East Germans, their bags packed, had jammed other train stations
along the route.
   The radio quoted Bavarian border police as saying the massive
numbers in the stations were believed to be responsible for the
delay in getting the East German trains into Prague to pick up
refugees there.
   East Germany agreed to have trains leaving Czechoslovkia pass
through East Germany before heading West, a face-saving measure for
hard-line ally Czechoslovakia, which had vowed not to let the East
Germans cross its borders to the West.
   In Bonn, a West German Foreign Ministry spokesman, Peter Rothen,
said today: ``We have no reason to believe the (train) delay is due
to anything other than technical difficulties.''
   However, a West German government spokesman, Hans Klein, said on
ZDF television today that the would-be emigres lining the train
route could be a reason for the delay in picking up Prague refugees.
   ``That would be a plausible reason _ that some people perhaps
would have wanted to jump on the trains going by,'' he said. ``That
would be normal in the current situation.''
   Meanwhile, more East Germans flooded the West German Embassy in
Warsaw, Poland, bringing to 400 the number there who were demanding
passage to West Germany.
   Many of them, their clothing still wet, said they swam rivers
and hid from police as they made their way to reform-minded Poland,
hoping to join the historic flight from East Germany.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said in a
radio interview that he expected a solution for the refugees in
Poland as well.
   West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper reported that
four East Germans had fled to the West German Embassy in Sofia in
Communist Bulgaria.
   East German leader Erich Honecker accused West Germany of trying
to ``destabilize'' his country by encouraging the exodus, which has
severely drained its labor force of young, skilled workers.
   The rejection of its Communist system is embarrassing East
Germany's leaders as they prepare to commemorate 40 years of
statehood this weekend in ceremonies Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is to attend.
   Bild reported today that Gorbachev had pressured Honecker into
reaching a solution to the crisis. The newspaper, quoting no
sources, said that ``Gorbachev let Honecker know he was willing to
come to the East German 40th anniversary celebrations only if the
refugee problem were solved.''
   East Berlin's curb on free travel effectively cuts off easy
escape routes for East Germans, who also had reached the West via
Hungary after that country's liberal leaders opened their western
border in mid-September.
   Hundreds of East Germans stormed through police lines and
climbed facades and rooftops to get inside the embassy compound on
Tuesday after crowding prompted West German officials to close it
to more asylum-seekers.
   It is the latest wave of an exodus that this year already has
seen more than 120,000 East Germans reached West Germany, where
they are granted automatic citizenship.

<HEAD>Bush Proposes $200 Million Grant to Poland</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 9 grafs new with Bush proposal; picks up 4th graf pvs, Democratic
leaders.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

   The Bush administration, under heavy pressure
from Congress to do more for the new government of Poland, today
proposed a $200 million grant to help that country restructure its
economy.
   The aid, which would require congressional approval, would be in
addition to $219 million in economic and food aid previously
announced by the administration.
   The proposal came as House and Senate Democrats proposed even
larger sums of aid to the new Solidarity-led government than sought
by Bush _ and invited the labor union's leader, Lech Walesa, to
address a joint meeting of Congress on Nov. 15 to outline his hopes
for Poland's future.
   Bush, meanwhile, invited both Poland's new prime minister,
Tadesz Mazowiecki, and communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski to
Washington for consultations, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
in announcing the new aid.
   The White House announcement follows agreement by the 12-nation
European Community to back a $650 million package of aid for Poland
and Hungary.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. grant would complement the European
package _ and would go toward a Polish request for a $1 billion
loan from the West. However, Fitzwater said the administration
favored a grant as its share rather than a loan so as not to add to
Poland's already staggering debt.
   ``The dramatic changes in Poland over the past two months have
lent new urgency to our efforts,'' the spokesman said. ``What
Poland is doing is historic, in the largest sense of the word.''
   Fitzwater said the money would be disbursed only after the
Polish government reachs agreement with the International Monetary
Fund on an economic restructuring plan.
   The United States also plans to send a team of experts, business
leaders and administration officials to Poland ``so that we can
provide the most effective help,'' Fitzwater said.
   Democratic leaders of both chambers joined Tuesday to dismiss
again Bush's $219 million package of initiatives in Eastern Europe
as ``grossly inadequate'' and ``timid.''
   They unveiled an aggressive Democratic legislative program of
grants and loans with a potential economic impact of more than $3.7
billion.
   The three-year Democratic package would be composed of loans
from international financial institutions, U.S. loans and grants,
and a five-year halt in Polish payments on its $2.5 billion U.S.
bank debt.
   ``Bold action today will be far less costly than timidity,''
said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``For if we
hesitate, and the opportunity is lost, we will be paying for it for
a long, long time _ in an escalating arms race.''
   Gephardt said it was ironic that a government that doubled U.S.
military spending to respond to a Soviet military threat, ``now
seems curiously paralyzed, unable to respond to the possibility of
economic freedom, democracy and peace breaking out in Eastern
Europe.''
   But Raymond Seitz, assistant secretary of state for European
affairs, denied such paralysis exists, saying Poland's new plan for
restructuring its centralized economy is ``in many respects a
declaration of economic independence.''
   Seitz told the House Foreign Affairs European subcommittee a
Polish request for a $1 billion loan to stabilize the economy is
``under very active review at very high levels. There will be a
response to that shortly.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the subcommittee, said
the Bush administration has established a ``clear pattern'' when it
comes to aid to Poland and Hungary.
   ``The president puts forward a proposal that is seen to be
inadequate, pressure builds up to do more, and the president puts
forward another inadequate proposal,'' Hamilton said.
   ``He is only moving in that direction because he is being
pressured by the Congress.''
   The invitation to Walesa to address a joint meeting of Congress
was extended by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who said the Solidarity
leader has come to represent ``the yearning for freedom and
economic opportunity that people feel in Eastern Europe and the
world over.''
   ``Guiding Solidarity to negotiate a transition toward free
elections and then achieving a sweeping mandate from the people and
then to take responsibility for the Polish government is close to a
modern political miracle,'' Mitchell said.
   The Democratic aid package includes $887 million in new U.S.
economic and food assistance to Poland and Hungary, of which it is
contemplated that $415 million would be appropriated for use in the
1990 fiscal year that began Sunday.
   Democrats said the U.S. funds would be obtained by trimming
appropriations for other programs but didn't identify what specific
programs would be cut.

<HEAD>Triple Crown Winner Secretariat is Destroyed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretariat, who in 1973 became racing's first
Triple Crown winner in 25 years, was destroyed today at age 19
because of a painful hoof ailment.
   ``Of course, I'm terribly sorry to lose an old friend,'' said
owner Helen Chenery. ``As long as he was alive, his memories had
more immediacy. The dream is over.''
   Secretariat had an incurable inflammation known as laminitis. He
was put down at Claiborne Farm, where he had been put out to stud,
said Gus Koch, the farm's assistant manager.
   Koch said Secretariat's condition rapidly worsened on Tuesday
and put the chestnut stallion in extreme pain for the first time.
   Secretariat was to be buried at the farm today, close to
stablemate Riva Ridge, who won the 1972 Kentucky Derby and Belmont
Stakes.
   Secretariat became the ``people's horse'' when he won the Triple
Crown with a 31-length victory in the Belmont, setting records
there and at the Kentucky Derby. The other Triple Crown race is the
Preakness.
   Not since Citation in 1948 had a horse won all three races.
   ``Red,'' as farmhands referred to the horse, was something of a
disappointment in the breeding shed. He ranked No. 25 among leading
active sires.
   ``Everybody still wants him to duplicate himself, and I just
don't think that will happen,'' said John Sosby, manager of
Claiborne Farm.

<TEXT>
   A Lebanese hijacker convicted of commandeering
a jetliner in Beirut in 1985 with two Americans aboard was
sentenced Wednesday to 30 years in prison.
   Fawaz Younis, grabbed by FBI agents aboard a yacht in 1987 and
brought to the United States to stand trial, told U.S. District
Court Judge Aubrey Robinson that ``I am not a member'' of any
terrorist group.
   Younis said the two Americans on the Jordanian airliner were
``treated as friends'' by the hijackers during a 30-hour ordeal
over the Mediterranean Sea that ended with the 70 passengers and
crew members being freed. The hijackers then blew up the aircraft.
   The judge ordered Younis to serve 30 years for hostage taking,
20 years for aircraft piracy and five years for conspiring to take
hostages, following his March 14 conviction by a jury on three of
six criminal charges. The sentences are to run concurrently.
   After the sentencing, Younis's attorney, Frank Carter, promised
to appeal the case on ``20 different issues.'' He said that the
question of U.S. jurisdiction is a critical one and that ``I don't
think it (the hijacking) had anything to do with Americans
whatsoever.''
   Assistant U.S. attorney Ramsey Johnson urged Robinson to impose
a sentence of life imprisonment, but the judge said he wouldn't
because no one was killed in the hijacking. Jordanian sky marshals
aboard the plane were beaten, but there was testimony at Younis's
trial that he ordered the violence stopped.
   But the judge said a lengthy sentence must be imposed because
time ``will never wipe out in the minds'' of the passengers and
crew the ``terror'' they experienced.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens called the sentence ``substantial''
and ``fair,'' adding that it ``vindicates the victims'' and sends a
``clear message'' to anyone ``who would engage in acts of
international terrorism.''
   Having spent the last two years in custody, Younis will be
eligible for parole in eight years, said Stephens.
   But Carter predicted that Younis ``will never be paroled'' and
that he will have to serve at least 20 years of his sentence, with
credit for the two he already has served. Federal prisoners
generally serve out two-thirds of their terms unless paroled.
   Carter said the federal law giving the government authority to
prosecute Younis focuses on taking into custody someone who has
``slipped into the United States'' after committing an illegal act
abroad. In this instance, the FBI ``reached out and dragged'' him
here, said Carter.
   Younis was lured aboard a yacht in the Mediterranean on Sept.
13, 1987, with the prospect of a drug deal and a party, according
to testimony at his trial.
   A member of the Lebanese Amal movement, Younis told the judge he
had been ``kidnapped'' by FBI agents. He carried out the hijacking
because he ``received an order'' from his military commander, who
is ``neither a terrorist nor a blood-thirsty beast,'' Younis said
in a statement he read to the judge.
   ``I exerted maximum effort to guarantee safety and return'' to
Beirut, said Younis.
   At his trial, Younis testified that he was instructed by his
superiors to fly the plane to Tunis, Tunisia, where a meeting of
Arab League representatives was in progress.
   During the hijacking, he read a declaration demanding the league
decide that one Arab nation allow all Palestinians to settle there
and that Palestinians be removed from Lebanon.
   ``Had I been with the Contra forces in Central America, would
that be terrorism'' or would he be considered one of the
``freedom-fighters?'' Younis asked the judge.

   Fire swept through a mobile home early
Wednesday, killing the brother of singer Bobby Vee and the man's
young son, police said.
   The bodies of Ron Velline, believed to be in his 40s, and his
son Ronald, about 9, were found in the burned-out shell of their
mobile home by police Capt. David Bruckner.
   The elder Velline's brother, Bobby Velline, otherwise known as
Bobby Vee, is a singing teen idol of the early 1960s who now lives
in St. Cloud, Minn.
   Bruckner said he was on his way to work when he discovered the
blaze at the Brookwood Mobile Home Park.
   ``I opened the door and yelled in but I didn't hear anything,''
Bruckner said. ``The flames and smoke were too much. I couldn't see
anything.''
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, but police said
the possibility of arson was being investivated because Velline had
filed reports of break-ins at his trailer in recent weeks.

<TEXT>
   An Oregon couple who lost an environmental
lawsuit against their county on a technicality won some sympathy,
at least, at the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
   During an hour-long hearing, the justices showed little
inclination to restore the victory it took Olaf and Mary Hallstrom
three years and $95,000 to win.
   ``Your case is an appealing one,'' Justice Antonin Scalia told
the Hallstroms' lawyer but noted that asking the court to interpret
a federal law contrary to its clear language is risky business.
   The Hallstroms' victory was overturned because their lawyer had
failed to notify federal and state environmental officials, as
required by the law under which they sued, before filing the 1982
suit.
   That lawyer, Kim Buckley of Portland, urged the justices
Wednesday to ``look at the spirit'' of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act, one of at least a dozen federal environmental
laws that gives private citizens the right to sue for enforcement.
   At issue is a narrow, but potentially significant, point of
environmental law _ one that may affect the success of private
citizen enforcement.
   The Hallstroms' suit contended that a county landfill adjacent
to what's left of their 200-acre dairy farm caused or contributed
to the pollution of their water supply.
   The couple's lawyer informed the county of their intention to
sue well before the 60-day period required by the federal law. But
Buckley did not give the same required notification to the federal
Environmental Protection Agency or the Oregon Department of
Environmental Quality.
   A federal judge, however, allowed the lawsuit to proceed and in
1985 ordered the county to remedy federal environmental law
violations within two years.
   The judge turned down the Hallstroms' request for $95,000 in
attorney fees, and the couple appealed.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1987 ruled that the
Hallstroms' suit should have been dismissed before any trial
because of the failure to notify.
   That left the Hallstroms at square one _ with the option of
filing a new lawsuit.
   ``It's just not fair'' to make the Hallstroms ``jump through a
judicial hoop that has no purpose,'' Buckley told the nation's
highest court.
   He argued that reinstating the Hallstroms' victory ``would
effectuate the will of Congress'' to protect the environment.
   But several justices voiced concern over straying from the
clearly worded notification requirement that Congress included in
the law.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy spoke about the need for ``a rule
that everyone can understand.''
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, while noting that interpreting the
law as written ``results in an unfortunate situation in this
case,'' said the law ``is workable as written.''
   The court was urged by I. Franklin Hunsaker, a Portland lawyer
representing the county, to uphold the circuit court's ruling so
government agencies can assess environmental messes before lawsuits
are filed over them.
   Hunsaker said treating the 60-day notice provision as mandatory
assures ``predictability and even-handedness in the administration
of this law.''
   Bush administration lawyer Brian J. Martin said the EPA agreed
that ``dismissal (of the Hallstroms' suit) is required.''
   A Supreme Court decision is expected by July.
   The case is Hallstrom vs. Tillamook County, 88-42.

   East Germans jammed Western
embassies, swam rivers and lined railroad tracks in at least four
Warsaw Pact nations Tuesday in a desperate bid to catch what could
be the last freedom trains to the West.
   The flood of would-be East German emigres in Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Bulgaria and East Germany came as the beleaguered
government in East Berlin said it would allow one more exodus of
disillusioned citizens.
   The statement covered an estimated 11,000 weary refugees who had
converged on the West German Embassy in Prague, but there were
reports thousands of others throughout the East bloc were hoping
take part.
   In Prague, the first of 15 trains began carrying East Germans to
the West on Wednesday evening.
   ``We knew it was our last chance,'' one of the East Germans told
reporters before departing. ``We were right, now the border is
closed.''
   East Germany, hoping to end the embarrassing exodus of its
young, skilled citizens before the Communist nation celebrates its
40th anniversary this weekend, on Tuesday closed its border with
ally Czechoslovakia to keep its people home.
   Because Czechoslovakia was the only nation where East Germans
could travel without receiving special permission, thousands had
streamed here to seek asylum.
   The clampdown on travel also was likely to severely curb the
number of East Germans going to reform-minded Hungary, which
spurred the exodus last month by allowing thousands of East Germans
to pass through. The shortest route to Hungary from East Germany is
through Czechoslovakia.
   West German border guards noted that only 500 had arrived via
Hungary on Tuesday, compared to 700 the day before and 1,000 the
day before that.
   East Germans were frantically trying other avenues to catch what
they feared would be their last chance to reach West Germany, where
they are granted automatic citizenship.
   In East Berlin, police Wednesday scuffled with about 50 East
Germans trying to enter the U.S. Embassy, witnesses said. Eighteen
others made it inside the compound Tuesday, U.S. diplomatic sources
said.
   ``This is our last hope,'' said one refugee in the group of 10
adults and eight children. ``We're not going to budge until we know
we'll be able to leave.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
Bush administration was talking to East German diplomats to resolve
the crisis.
   In East Germany in general, there were reports of thousands of
frantic citizens lining the rail route that the weekend freedom
train had taken.
   Police beat people with truncheons to disperse a defiant crowd
of 5,000 that packed a Dresden train station and lined the tracks,
chanting ``We want out!'' witnesses told The Associated Press.
   The trains were to travel through East German territory via
Dresden to the West German border town of Hof. The detour through
East Germany was requested by East Berlin authorities so that the
refugees could be formally expelled from their country.
Czechoslovakia had vowed not to let East Germans emigrate to the
West across its borders.
   According to reliable East German sources, four East Germans
still were seeking asylum in the West German mission in East Berlin.
   There were also unconfirmed reports that four East Germans had
sought asylum in Bonn's embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria.
   In Warsaw, Poland, the number of East Germans seeking asylum at
the Bonn Embassy swelled to 400. About 130 arrived Wednesday. Many
_ their clothing still wet _ told of swimming rivers and evading
border police to get to the embassy.
   East Germany's state railroad provided 15 trains to transport
the 10,000 East Germans who had crowded the Prague embassy and the
streets just outside it.
   The trains had been scheduled to leave Tuesday night but were
repeatedly delayed.
   West German officials first said technical difficulties appeared
to be the reason. However, later they said it could have been due
to the East Germans lining the tracks in their own country hoping
to join the exodus.
   ``That would be a plausible reason _ that some people perhaps
would have wanted to jump on the trains going by,'' West German
government spokesman Hans Klein told the ZDF television network.
   Refugees in and around the baroque palace that houses the
embassy fought the bitter cold with hot tea, huddling under
blankets or wrapping themselves in jackets sent out by those who
had found a place inside the building.
   Parents cradling children sat in the littered street outside.
Inside the embassy garden, about the size of a football field, the
trim lawns were trudged to a sea of mud.
   Police in the West German border town of Hof said about 1,000
young East Germans were waiting along the tracks near Plauen, an
East German town near the Czechoslovak border.
   Hungarian and West German media reported thousands more had
crowded other spots along the route the trains were expected to
take.
   On Sunday, about 7,000 East Germans arrived in West Germany
after East Germany allowed thousands crowded in embassies in Prague
and Warsaw to leave. Many of those who arrived said they had jumped
on board as the trains passed through their homeland.

   The nation's only university was closed
Wednesday after thousands of students protesting the arrests of two
student leaders clashed with hundreds of riot police. Fifty
students were arrested.
   All 8,000 students were ordered to leave the University of
Zimbabwe campus by noon Thursday. Police sealed off entrances to
the campus as darkness fell. Riot squads barred students from
entering the campus.
   The violence began after the arrests of student council
officials Arthur Mutambara and Enock Chikweche. In a leaflet
distributed before the start of classes, student leaders called for
a meeting to discuss the arrests.
   The leaflet alleged police surrounded and stormed a campus
residence and that Mutambara was ``profusely bleeding'' after
jumping from a second-floor window in an effort to escape police.
   Student leaders said they believed Mutambara's arrest was
prompted by a statement he issued Oct. 2 criticizing the government
and university authorities.
   The University of Zimbabwe's vice chancellor, Walter Kamba,
announced the closing at a news conference after conferring with
President Robert Mugabe.
   Kamba called the move ``regrettable and sad'' and said it was a
university decision and not the government's.
   But student leaders, who requested anonymity, told The
Associated Press they believed Mugabe had personally ordered the
shutdown because of widespread student disillusionment with the
leadership over top-level corruption.
   About 4,000 students boycotted classes and many fought running
battles with baton-wielding riot squads through the day, a student
spokesman said. Rioters threw stones at police and smashed the
windows of a limousine used by Kamba.
   Sporadic clashes continued throughout the day and the
semi-official Zimbabwe Inter African News Agency said more than 50
protesters were arrested. They could face up to five years in
prison. Students said police injured several protesters.
   In the past year, college students have staged several
demonstrations in which they accused the government of stifling
free expression and curbing academic freedoms. They also have
protested official corruption.
   Education minister Fay Chung has called students ``hooligans and
drunkards'' who were being manipulated by political opponents to
attack the government.

   Police can't find the owner of a 4-foot,
fiberglass squirrel that appeared on a football field, but they
suspect the animal is a fugitive from a miniature golf course.
   The hollow figure dubbed Squinky showed up Monday on the 50-yard
line of a school playing field. Police and school officials figure
it was a prank, but they can't find anyone to claim the squirrel.
   Police have been calling miniature golf courses to no avail. The
search for Squinky's owner continued Wednesday.
   ``I've got a lot of squirrels in my barn, but none that are
pre-fabricated,'' said James Beerer, a high school principal. ``If
there's no takers, I'm willing to adopt the squirrel.''

   With a flip of a stripe, an artist
accidentally turned the West German flag into the Belgian flag on
31,000 T-shirts, mugs and other souvenirs for the city's
Oktoberfest.
   ``This could be an international incident,'' City Council member
David Mann said Tuesday.
   The graphic artist hired by organizers of the festival held
Sept. 16-17 said he moved a vertical red stripe from the middle to
the right side of the German flag to keep the color from blending
with the event's red logo.
   The resulting black-orange-red combination is the Belgian flag.
   Kelly Pharmer of Decatur, Ill., who came to Cincinnati to visit
friends, noticed the problem and wrote the City Council.
   ``It's one thing to mess around with words, but not a country's
flag,'' she said Tuesday.

<HEAD>Court Urged To Allow Cities To Crack Down on Sexually Oriented Businesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An apparently sympathetic Supreme Court was
urged Wednesday to bolster communities' power to crack down on
adult bookstores, X-rated movie theaters and other sexually
oriented businesses.
   Several justices vigorously challenged claims that a Dallas
licensing ordinance violates the Constitution's free-speech
guarantees, while they seemed to react more warmly to arguments by
a lawyer for Dallas supporting the ordinance.
   John H. Weston, a Beverly Hills, Calif., lawyer representing the
sex trade in Dallas, said the ordinance's broad authority to deny
licenses is an unlawful ``prior restraint'' on free expression.
   The local law goes well beyond traditional government regulation
of public health and safety, Weston argued during a 60-minute high
court hearing. ``We're not dealing with nuclear power plants,'' he
said.
   The law means ``one may not disseminate speech one has chosen to
disseminate, absent a permit,'' he said. It ``permits the city to
do indirectly what it cannot do directly.''
   The court previously has empowered cities to use zoning laws to
limit the locations of sexually explicit businesses, requiring them
to be concentrated in one area or spread out. But a ruling in the
Dallas case, expected by July, could give communities enhanced
control through licensing laws.
   The ordinance, which took effect in June, requires sexually
oriented businesses to obtain a license issued by the city police
chief, who has broad discretion to deny one. Licenses are denied to
anyone convicted of various sex crimes, such as obscenity and
promoting prostitution.
   Weston argued that bookstores, and other businesses engaged in
disseminating speech, should be given special consideration. He
said that they should be granted licenses to operate within a
reasonable time unless public officials can prove there is a good
reason to deny them a permit.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said there is no precedent
for giving special consideration to bookstores that seek business
licenses.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in frequently barbed questioning, said
to Weston: ``You mean that every bookstore cannot be subject to
normal business licensing?''
   Dallas City Attorney Analeslie Muncy defended the ordinance as a
key weapon against crime and urban decay.
   The licensing rules are aimed at businesses that ``are 100
percent sexually oriented,'' she said.
   She said nothing prevents businesses from distributing their
wares in other ways.
   ``They can sell the same material through the mails,
door-to-door or on a street corner,'' she said.
   Several justices questioned whether the ordinance goes too far
in denying licenses also to anyone living with someone previously
convicted of a sex crime.
   But Scalia came to Mrs. Muncy's aid by suggesting that provision
legitimately would ``prevent evasion'' of the law by an ex-convict
who wants to transfer ownership of the business to a roommate or
live-in lover.
   The ordinance is being challenged by owners of adult bookstores,
motion picture theaters, nightclubs and motels, but it also applies
to nude-model studios and sexual-encounter establishments.
   The ordinance also bars motel owners from renting rooms for less
than 10 hours, a provision intended to discourage prostitution. And
establishments offering sexually oriented entertainment must be
open to surveillance by authorities without search warrants.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the local law,
saying it is a lawful attack on urban blight, crime and declining
property values.
   Several groups have joined the Dallas business owners in
attacking the ordinance. They include the American Booksellers
Association, the Association of American Publishers, the National
Association of College Stores and the Freedom to Read Foundation.
   Citizens for Decency Through Law and the American Family
Association lined up to support the Dallas ordinance.
   The case is FW@PBS vs. Dallas, 87-2012.

   Rescuers in boats and helicopters
searched the Gulf of Mexico today for eight people whose fishing
boat struck a natural gas pipeline, causing an explosion and
fireball that killed three other crew members.
   Three of the North Umberland's 14-member crew were injured when
the 160-foot metal-hulled boat hit the pipeline just before dark
Tuesday, a half-mile offshore.
   Four Coast Guard boats and several private vessels searched
today, and the agency launched a helicopter after fog lifted. Coast
Guard and private helicopters with searchlights swept the area
through the night until fog set in.
   The pilot of a privately-owned helicopter spotted the third
victim just after noon today. The Coast Guard recovered the body.
   ``It was just a boom and big ball of fire went up into the air
about 300 feet,'' said Allen Willett, a helicopter pilot for a
company that ferries crews and gear to offshore drilling rigs. ``As
soon as I saw what it was, I radioed back in and they notified the
Coast Guard.''
   The spectacular explosion was heard by Port Arthur police on
shore. ``It made a pretty big noise,'' Sgt. T.K. Donnell said.
   Willett said the boat was on fire when he reached it and spotted
three survivors and two dead.
   ``We got three life rafts in the water and I hovered low over
the water,'' Willett said. ``My mechanic jumped in. ... He got the
one in the most distress, got him inside the life raft. The other
two made it on their own.''
   The mechanic, Dennis Brooks, and the injured men were brought to
shore with Coast Guard assistance.
   The gas line was shut off early today and the fires were put out
on the pipeline and the boat, said Coast Guard Lt. Scott
LaRochelle. Coast Guard spokesman Don Merwin said he did not know
who owns the underwater pipeline.
   Mike Benson, spokesman for the National Transportation Safety
Board in Washington, said the agency was sending a team to
investigate.
   Coast Guard Capt. Michael Collan said the Cameron, La.-based
North Umberland was equipped with a fishing net, but it was not
known if the net snagged on the pipeline and broke it.
   The North Umberland made daily runs for menhaden, a small fish
commonly known as pogy and used for poultry feed, said Barney
White, spokesman for Houston-based Zapada Heynie Corp., which owns
the boat.
   Three injured men were taken to Baptist Hospital of Southeast
Texas in Beaumont. A 53-year-old man from Sulphur, La., was listed
in critical condition with severe burns over 68 percent of his body.
   A 28-year-old Cameron man was listed in serious condition with
burns on his face and arms, and a 31-year-old man from Lake
Charles, La., was in shock, but listed in good condition.
   Names of the injured and dead were not immediately available.

   The Panamanian rebels who tried to oust Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega had him ``in their clutches'' for several
hours, according to some U.S. officials who said today they are
mystified as to why the insurgents let him go.
   The spokesman for President Bush said, ``We don't' really know
if that was the case,'' and an attorney who represents Noriega
disputed the account.
   The officials, asking not to be identified, said Noriega was in
the custody of the rebels for four to five hours after taking over
the Defense Force headquarters Tuesday.
   ``It's crazy, I don't understand it,'' one official said when
asked why the insurgents decided to free Noriega.
   The account was disputed by one of Noriega's Miami-based
lawyers, Raymond Takiff, who said the general was away from the
headquarters when the fighting began. Takiff said he spoke with
Defense Force spokesman Edgardo Lopez while Noriega stood at
Lopez's side.
   Shortly before the rebellion was put down Tuesday afternoon,
Jose Blandon, a former Noriega aide, told reporters in Washington
that he was informed by one of the leaders of the insurrection by
telephone that Noriega had been wounded while in rebel custody.
   But when Noriega made a brief public appearance after the
rebellion was defeated, there was no obvious indication of any
injury.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today that the
rebels on Tuesday ``indicated they had Noriega'' in custody, but
``We don't' really know if that was the case.''
   He said these individuals, whom he described as low-level, also
``made it clear they weren't willing to give up Noriega,'' to face
drug trafficking charges in the United States, the spokesman added.

around the world via fax Wednesday, lighting in Amsterdam,
Jerusalem and Tokyo to commemorate the 320th anniversary of the
artist's death.
   ``Rembrandt would have liked this,'' said Max Alexenberg, the
American artist responsible for the electronic event, saying the
master was himself something of a technology buff, using the latest
equipment and techniques then available.
   ``I feel like I'm painting on a global canvas,'' said
Alexenberg, a foThen, he enlarged the computer's stark rendition of the
drawing
into a 6 by 4 foot angel, divided into 24 sections to fit into a
fax machine.
   ``This `FaxArt' event reminds us that the electronic revolution
is the most far-reaching in human history,'' Alexenberg said in a
written statement defining his work. ``It is reshaping our
experience of space and time and redefining art.''
   While Americans now fax everything from restaurant orders to job
resumes, few probably realize that a crude telegraphic prototype of
what eventually became the fax machine was invented in 1842 by
Alexander Bain, a Scottish physicist and clockmaker, according to
AT&amp;T.
   The machine's popularity slowly increased over the past three
decades, then went wild in recent years.
   Laura Abbott, an AT&amp;T spokeswoman, said industry experts predict
the number of fax machines installed will triple worldwide, from 3
million in 1989 to 9 million in 1992.

<HEAD>LOS ANGELES: 13 murders.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The unanimous recommendation is subject to approval by Superior
Court Judge Michael Tynan, who can instead sentence the 29-year-old
from El Paso, Texas, to life in prison without parole.
   Ramirez, dressed in black and minus his usual dark sunglasses,
rocked in his chair as the judge read the jury's recommendation of
death down the list of murder victims.
   The jury, which decided Ramirez's fate in its fifth day of
talks, deliberated 22 days before convicting the shaggy-haired
defendant Sept. 20 of 13 murders and 30 related felonies in a
string of satanism-tinged attacks.
   His crimes were gruesome. One victim's eyes were gouged out. In
another case, a woman was raped beside the body of her dead
husband. Occult symbols were scrawled on walls, and Ramirez ordered
victims to pray to Satan.
   California has 265 inmates on Death Row but hasn't executed
anyone since 1967.

<HEAD>First Six Months of Pittston Strike Costly to Union, Company</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers strike against
Pittston Coal Group is growing more divisive and expensive to both
sides as it turns 6 months old Thursday, but the costs are
remarkably even.
   Contract talks are on hold and the union leadership has raised
the stakes of the strike by using mass demonstrations to choke off
coal shipments.
   The UMW, with a $100 million national strike fund, has been
fined $25.4 million for illegal strike activities, mostly for
efforts to disrupt coal production by replacement workers.
   The union also has been paying each of Pittston's 1,695 union
employees from Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky $200 a week
from the fund since they went on strike April 5.
   In the first three months of the strike, the second financial
quarter, Pittston reported losses of $3.6 million compared with $9
million in profits the same quarter in 1988.
   UMW research director Mike Buckner said financial statements
from the next three months coming out in a few weeks will show the
company losing at least as much in potential revenue _ or $25.2
million over six months.
   Pittston also has a strike kitty _ a $100 million line of credit
the company received in late 1987, Buckner said.
   ``We have charged that that is a strike breaking fund,'' he said.
   A Russell County judge is expected to take away more UMW chips
by once again fining the union, this time for taking over
Pittston's main coal preparation plant for four days in late
September, the most dramatic act of civil disobedience of the
strike.
   UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts said similar unarmed invasions
and occupations to cut off coal shipments will be mounted soon,
regardless of the cost.
   ``This strike has been very expensive already,'' Roberts said.
He added, ``We're prepared to do whatever it takes to win.''
   The union has said all along that money has little to do with
this labor dispute. The main issues are not wages but job security
and health benefits for retired workers.
   ``If we have to spend money to win this strike then we're going
to spend it,'' Buckner said.
   Asked whether the union could afford the drain on the strike
fund, Buckner said, ``The question is, can we afford not to protest
Pittston's actions?''
   Pittston President Mike Odom declined to discuss specifics of
production or financial losses. But he said, ``The violence and
blatant violation of our rights under the law has cost the company
a substantial amount of money during the six months of the strike.''
   The union claims Pittston's production is about one-third of its
normal output. Tax records in the counties where Pittston has mines
show substantial decreases in the amount of coal coming out of the
ground.
   However, records at Virginia ports show little change in coal
shipments since the strike began. Shipments by all companies using
the ports has increased 20 percent through August, from about 25
million tons to about 30 millions tons, said John Randolph,
director of the Virginia Center for Coal and Energy Research.
   ``There is little data to show any dramatic effects on Pittston
operations or on Virginia production,'' he said.
   Buckner and coal industry analysts say that is because Pittston
is buying high-priced coal from other companies to fulfill its
contracts.
   ``That is indicative of the severity of the economic
difficulties the company is having with this strike,'' Buckner said.
   To block coal shipments the union contends were bound for
Pittston's preparation plants, UMW President Richard Trumka ordered
selective strikes that began early Monday at two mines in Kentucky
and five in West Virginia.
   About 350 UMW employees walked off their jobs Monday and a union
official said there was no way to tell how long that would last.

<HEAD>Senators Criticize Bush Choice for Agriculture's Top Natural Resources
Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Agriculture Committee chairman on
Wednesday criticized President Bush's choice for a top natural
resources job as more concerned about pleasing special interests
than protecting the public trust.
   ``In government, the public interest has to come first,'' Sen.
Patrick Leahy told James Cason, the nominee for assistant secretary
of agriculture for natural resources and the environment during
confirmation hearings.
   Cason, 35, has been a high-ranking official in the Interior
Department since 1982 and is acting head of Land and Minerals
Management.
   Leahy said as a government official, Cason's one assignment has
been to protect the public interest.
   ``Time and time again, he has failed that assignment,'' said
Leahy, who grilled Cason during two days of hearings on decisions
he made at Interior.
   ``When it came to protecting the spotted owl, Mr. Cason chose
timber interests over the public welfare,'' the senator said in his
closing statement.
   ``When it came to getting tough on oil and gas companies who
were not paying their fair share of royalties, the decisions were
made behind closed doors. Key parties were excluded from meetings.''
   Leahy said Cason tried to stop the government from collecting
oil royalties, even where evidence of collusion or underpayment
among companies existed.
   During questioning, Leahy said Cason changed an audit system
when the oil industry reacted negatively to it, even though it was
designed to collect millions of dollars in underpaid royalties owed
the Indian tribes and the state and federal governments.
   Cason stopped audits of any leases negotiated before 1980, but
allowed oil companies to continue collecting overpayments from the
government for those leases, said Leahy.
   Cason said that by concentrating on audits of leases after 1980
and eliminating the ones that came earlier, the department was
merely making the best use of its audit staff.
   In addition, Cason said the government could make more money
through the post-1980 audits.
   Leahy chastised Cason for not consulting with the states or the
Indian tribes before eliminating the pre-1980 audits.
   ``It's like a judge in a divorce case locking the wife out of
the courtroom and dealing only with the husband,'' said Leahy.
   Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., questioned Cason's management
abilities, saying a General Accounting Office report showed that a
system under Cason's jurisdiction for finding mining law violators
has been defective for four years.
   Cason blamed the computer system and said the problems were
being worked out.
   Daschle said ``it says something about management'' when after
four years ``it didn't get better.''
   Cason assured Leahy that if confirmed, he would work with the
committee to set Agriculture Department policy.
   ``We have a plethora of statutes that require us to do some very
difficult things,'' he said. ``During the confirmation process I
have learned a lot. I have been exposed to new opinions.''

<HEAD>Suits, Fines on Industrial Waste Announced Against 11 Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency announced
lawsuits and penalties Wednesday against 11 cities, including
Detroit, Phoenix and San Antonio, accusing them of allowing
untreated toxic industrial chemicals into public sewage systems.
   The action is the latest in a stepped up effort by the EPA in
recent months to force municipalities to take action against
industrial plants that do not pretreat toxic chemicals before
discharging them into public sewers.
   The latest suits brought to 61 the number of cities that have
been targets of either administrative fines or civil lawsuits this
year for violations of federal water pollution laws in connection
with the toxic industrial discharges.
   ``We are sending a message, a very clear message,'' declared EPA
Administrator William Reily. ``No individual, no industry, no
municipality will be allowed to violate environmental laws without
the risk of sanctions and penalties.''
   He said the enforcement actions reflected cases that long have
been under scrutiny from the EPA and where ``consistent problems''
exist in gettng local officials to assure that all industrial toxic
wastes are pretreated before being allowed into public sewage
systems.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who joined Reilly at the news
conference announcing the latest lawsuits, said the actions reflect
``our determination not to sit idly by while our waters continue to
be befouled.''
   ``We simply cannot allow harmful pollutants to reach our rivers
and streams untreated,'' continued Thornburgh, adding that the
lawsuits are not likey to be the last such actions.
   According to EPA estimates, there are more than 870 million
pounds of toxic industrial chemicals _ including cyanide, arsenic
and hazardous heavy metals such as cadmium and lead _ dumped into
public sewage treatment systems each year.
   These wastes, which are combined with normal sewage and after
further treatment are released into open waters, are legal as long
as the toxics are pretreated at the source. When not pretreated
they can damage public sewage treatment equipment, pose hazards to
workers, interfere with the degradation of biological wastes
already in the system, and contaminate fish and shellfish in open
waters, officials said.
   Nevertheless, the EPA estimates that one-third of the public
sewage treatment facilities covered by federal law don't adequately
monitor such pretreatment or take adequate action against violators.
   The four lawsuits filed Wednesday were against Detroit, whose
city-run sewage treatment facility treats wastes from more than 400
industrial users; Phoenix, Ariz., where public sewage systems carry
wastes from 100 industrial plants; and San Antonio and El Paso,
Texas, which together have about 130 industrial users. San Antonio
agreed as part of the suit to pay $225,000 for past violations,
officials said.
   Officials said other lawsuits filed earlier this week were
against Beaumont, Tex.; Dunkirk, N.Y.; Easton and Punxsutawney,
Pa.; and Gloucester, Mass. In addition, consent agreements were
reached this week with Nacogdoches, Tex. and Bellefonte, Pa. for
$60,000 and $64,000 penalties respectively.
   The federal actions allege that the cities have not adequately
identified the industrial discharges, allowed discharges in ome
cases without proper permits, didn't screen samples of the
wastewater to determine if industrial plants were in compliance,
and failed to take action against polluters violating the
pretreatment requirements.
   Jessica Landman, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, praised the EPA and Justice Department action, but
maintained it was only a first step in getting reluctant
municipalities to get tough with industrial polluters.
   Often, she said, ``it's like putting the fox in charge of the
henhouse'' because in many cases the industrial polluter also is a
significant political and economic power in a community.
   Last April a report of the practices of 502 municipal sewage
treatment plants by the General Accounting Office, the
congressional watchdog agency, also concluded that many cities are
reluctant to take strong action against industrial polluters
because of local political pressure and fears the companies might
move elsewhere.
   The GAO findings came before the EPA began its stepped up
enforcement program aimed at city-run sewage treatment facilities
nationwide.
   Of the 61 cases _ including the 11 begun this week _ where
administrative action or lawsuits have been initiated this year,
about a third ended with fines totaling more than $2.1 million,
including a $1.1 million civil penalty paid last August by Denver.
   The EPA is seeking another $1.9 million in penalties in the two
dozen cases that remain open, a figure that will increase when
proposed penalties are added from the latest round of lawsuits,
officials said.
   But some environmentalists question whether even those fines _
some as low as $2,000 _ are enough, noting the maximum allowed is
$25,000 per violation, a sum that in some cases could mean millions
of dollars in fines against a city.

   Character assassination is what Mayor
Carolyn Robinson calls her city's ranking at the bottom of a
333-city list of U.S. metropolitan areas.
   The upcoming edition of the ``Places Rated Almanac,'' which
rates U.S. metropolitan areas of 50,000 or more, reportedly has
Pine Bluff at the bottom, but the publisher declines to confirm the
rating.
   ``It's sort of like blackmail or something, a violation of
character,'' Mrs. Robinson said. ``It's like a character
assassination of your city.''
   When the last almanac appeared in 1985, Pine Bluff was second to
last among 329 places. The new edition, to be published by Prentice
Hall in New York, hits the sales racks Nov. 1.
   The ratings are based on cost of living, climate,
transportation, education, crime, jobs, arts, recreation and
health, and the environment.
   Mrs. Robinson and civic leaders publicly challenged the 1985
rankings, but time around, she said she won't defend Pine Bluff
because that only seemed to draw more attention to the ranking.
   Pat Lile, vice president for community development of the
Greater Pine Bluff Chamber of Commerce, said the ratings are just
``the sizzle that sells the book.''
   ``How can you compare Pine Bluff, with a 63,000 population, with
a city of New York's size? It's like comparing apples and
oranges,'' Mrs. Robinson said.

   Cher quietly arrived in this picturesque
village to begin filming scenes for the movie ``Mermaids.''
   About 150 people gathered Tuesday on Main Street to catch a
glimpse of Cher, who emerged briefly after finishing interior shots
in an office.
   The movie is described in publicity literature as ``a comedic
rendering of a realistic coming-of-age story centering on a
free-spirited mother who hasn't really finished growing up, and her
two individualistic daughters who yearn to settle down.''
   Cher portrays the mother.
   The crowd waited most of the day. Cher appeared dressed in an
aquamarine-with-black-polkadots dress, sporting a bee hive hairdo.

   Amar studied videotape of Jordan on the court.
   ``I'm amazed at the way Michael moves so effortlessly through

   Choreographer Gus Giordano created the dance at the urging of
his son, Patrick, a Jordan fan. Giordano uses five dancers from his

   Actor Tom Selleck said he didn't pay much
attention to a release he signed before shooting scenes for his new
movie at a maximum security prison.
   ``I don't remember it specifically, but I think it meant if we
die in there, we're not gonna hold the company responsible,''
Selleck said.
   The movie, ``An Innocent Man,'' included scenes filmed at Nevada
State Penitentiary in Carson City. Some inmates were extras on the
film.
   ``We did sign a release. I didn't pay much attention to it,''
Selleck said in a taped, two-part interview to air Thursday and
Friday on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Selleck portrays a fictional airplane mechanic, Jimmie Rainwood,
who is wrongfully accused of cocaine possession and goes to prison
for three years. Rainwood and his wife work to clear his name after
his parole.
   Selleck said he learned a thing or two about prison life.
   ``You don't avoid eye contact with people, but you don't stare
at people because that's assaultive,'' Selleck said. ``If you avoid
eye contact, that's inviting trouble. You look at people, and you

   Mayor Coleman Young said he created a $150,000
trust fund for his only son, whose mother sued for paternity, to
ensure the boy receives a good education.
   Young publicly discussed 6-year-old Joel Loving for the first
time Tuesday, the day after he agreed to pay $225 in weekly child
support and set up the trust fund.
   ``I intend to see to it that any son of mine is well taken care
of, and not only until he reaches the age of 18,'' said the
71-year-old Young.
   Young said he wants to make sure the child is ``given an
opportunity to learn a profession, to learn a trade to enable
himself to look out for himself in later life.''
   Young had no children during two marriages that ended in divorce.
   In a court settlement, Young agreed to provide Joel with $10,000
a year from age 19 through 24 and $90,000 when he turns 25.
   Joel's mother, Annivory Calvert, is a former executive in the
Detroit Department of Public Works. She sued Young in January
before moving to Fontana, Calif., to direct its public works
department.

   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
told a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday his nation intends
``to eradicate drug trafficking at its very roots.''
   But Salinas, who is on a state visit to the United States,
warned that ``at the world level, we are losing.'' He said that was
unacceptable, and called for greater cooperation between
governments to turn the tide.
   While vowing an all-out effort to curb drug trafficking, Salinas
firmly ruled out joint U.S.-Mexican military operations to fight
the traffickers.
   ``The responsibility for the fight in our country is exclusively
ours,'' he said. ``There will be no joint military operations on
our soil.
   ``Mexico intends to eradicate drug trafficking at its very roots
in the sphere that falls under its responsibility,'' Salinas said,
speaking in Spanish while his audience of senators and House
members read from English translations.
   Drug smuggling and the alleged corruption of many Mexican law
enforcement authorities have led to complaints in Congress that
have at times been so strident they have been dubbed ``Mexico
bashing.''
   Salinas appeared to be appealing for an end to this, saying,
``The time has come to build a new relationship free of myths and
distrust, abuses and recriminations.''
   He said that the worldwide fight against drug trafficking also
is shared by Mexico but that mutual accusations about who is to
blame for the multibillion scourge waste time and effort.
   ``In Mexico, we now affirm that drug-trafficking is a threat to
national sovereignty ... because, as in other nations, it corrupts
whatever it touches,'' Salinas said.
   Later, in a speech at the National Press Club, Salinas said
Mexico will provide ``no haven and no sanctuary'' for narcotics
trafickers.
   ``We will hit them where it hurts, in the pocket and in their
personal liberty,'' he said.
   The Mexican president also used his speech to Congress to renew
his appeal for greater Mexican access to U.S. markets, saying that
while Mexico has eliminated most non-tarrif barriers to U.S.
products, ``we continue confronting them in the United States.''
   Salinas described this as an ``inequitable paradox'' and said
Mexico must have ``greater and more secure access to the world's
greatest market, the United States'' to obtain the economic growth
that is needed to improve the lot of its people.
   U.S. officials disagree with Salinas' portrayal of the United
States as a protectionist nation. They say two-thirds of Mexico's
exports come to the United States and that Mexico had a $2.7
billion surplus in its U.S. trade last year on total two-way trade
of about $44 billion.

   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher on Wednesday rejected charges from East Berlin that Bonn
sparked the exodus of East Germans to the West to destabilize
Communist East Germany.
   ``They believe in West Germany that they can destabilize East
Germany with a broad-based attack. But it will not work,'' East
German leader Erich Honecker said in a speech earlier this week.
   The state-run Berliner Zeitung in the Communist capital accused
West Germany of trying to ``provoke conflict and increase tension
in Europe'' by allegedly luring the refugees.
   Genscher rejected those charges in a radio interview Wednesday
and again called for reforms rejected by East Berlin's Communist
leadership.
   ``A reform movement can only be carried out with political
stability,'' Genscher said in an interview with Norddeutsche
Rundfunk. ``The federal government is opposed to any
destabilization by words or deeds.''
   Government officials in Bonn also have denied East German
allegations that West Germany is attracting the refugees with false
promises.
   Still, West German employers and government officials have made
no secret of their delight in having the refugees, whose numbers
have topped 43,000 since Hungary opened its borders to the West on
Sept. 11.
   Most of the refugees are young, skilled workers, who ordinarily
would form the backbone of the East German economy. East Germany
already has admitted that the country's dissatisfied work force is
suffering.
   Genscher made it clear Bonn has no intention of changing course
to placate East Germany.
   ``The West German embassies will stay open,'' Genscher said.
   The latest arrivals headed to Bavaria from the West German
Embassy in Prague.
   Despite the war of words between the two countries, numerous
questions remain as to whether West Germany has an ulterior motive
in welcoming newcomers to one of Europe's most densely populated
countries.
   The latest wave in the exodus comes just days before the 40th
anniversary of the founding of East Germany, and some East German
officials say Bonn is trying to embarrass it during the planned
celebrations.
   Many politicians in Bonn also are looking ahead to the era after
the rule of Erich Honecker, the 77-year-old leader of East Germany.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has vowed to continue pressing
East Berlin to make political reforms, even though there are no
indications that Honecker's successor will be interested in
undertaking them.
   Beyond that, West German leaders are looking forward even more
eagerly to their goal of reunification with East Germany, which
they say can only come about if the two countries are joined in a
Western-style democratic system.
   East Germany also has accused West Germany of supporting the
growing opposition movement within the Communist country.

   A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed the
core of the nation's largest ``comparable worth'' lawsuit, a claim
that California deliberately underpaid thousands of women in
female-dominated state jobs.
   U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ruled that the California
State Employees' Association had failed to prove deliberate sex
discrimination in state salaries.
   She allowed CSEA to submit new arguments on a claim that state
policies had the effect of illegally holding down the salaries of
female state employees. But that type of lawsuit, without proof of
intent, has been made much more difficult to prove by a recent
Supreme Court ruling.
   CSEA sued in 1984 on behalf of 60,000 or more past and present
secretaries, clerks, nurses and other people in predominantly
female state jobs. The lawsuit contended those jobs had been
deliberately underpaid for decades because the employees were
women. It sought hundreds of millions of dollars in back pay.
   The union described the lawsuit as a sex discrimination case and
resisted the label of ``comparable worth,'' the doctrine that jobs
of equal skill, effort and responsibility deserve equal pay.
   But the case has been generally described as a comparable worth
lawsuit because it is based on pay disparities between different
types of jobs, rather than claiming that women were paid less than
men in the same job.
   The state denied discrimination and said any differences in pay
levels reflected market rates. Lower pay for female-dominated jobs
based on prevailing market levels was declared legal in 1985 by the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in an opinion by future Supreme
Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.
   The crucial issue in Wednesday's ruling was whether the state
deliberately discriminated against women in the 1930s, when state
pay scales were revised. CSEA contended that the effects of unequal
pay levels for men and women in those revisions persist today.
   But Patel ruled that documents from a 1931 salary revision,
containing staff comments suggesting lower pay for some
female-dominated jobs, failed to prove deliberate and systematic
discrimination, and that the effects of any bias were largely
eliminated in a further reclassification in 1937-38.

<HEAD>Expert: Healthy Women Need Fewer Prenatal Doctor Visits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a federal panel of experts
said Wednesday that healthy women could get by with fewer visits to
the doctor during pregnancy, but women at high risk need more and
better prenatal care.
   Dr. Mortimer G. Rosen, panel chairman and head of obstetrics and
gynecology at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in New
York, said healthy women whose fetuses are at no apparent risk now
visit a doctor about 14 times during pregnancy.
   Eliminating or reducing some laboratory tests and procedures
could cut five to seven visits from this schedule, according to the
recommendations of Rosen's panel, whose report was issued by the
Public Health Service this week.
   The report emphasizes the need for preconception counseling to
warn women about the dangers of smoking, drinking and drug use
before they become pregnant and recommends that this counseling be
covered by insurance plans.
   It also recommends prenatal care be available to all women,
though it did not estimate what that would cost.
   More than 25 percent of women receive poor prenatal care or none
at all, Rosen said, resulting in a high infant mortality rate for
the United States.
   For women at low risk for problems during pregnancy, ``some of
the visits (to their doctor) don't at least obviously contribute to
the prevention of illness and the medical health of the mother,''
Rosen said.
   For example, he said, healthy women don't need to be tested for
protein in their urine at every prenatal visit and women who have
had a Pap test within the past year don't need another just because
they become pregnant. He also said blood pressure measurements
aren't necessary during every visit and more than one pelvic exam
during pregnancy often is not needed.
   Ultimately, the schedule of visits should be determined by the
patient and her physician, he said, adding that ``some women might
want more contact (with their physician) and that is their right.''
   Rosen said he expected some physicians will dispute the panel's
recommendation for healthy women, but he added: ``Let the people
who feel this is wrong test it.''
   The panel did not estimate the savings that could result from
less prenatal care for healthy women or the costs for additional
care for women with fetuses at higher risk. But it expected
considerably more public funds would be needed since many women who
need better prenatal care live near or below the poverty line.
   However, providing more care before a child is born will save
costs in the long run, Rosen said.
   ``Prenatal care must be accessible to all women,'' Rosen said.
``Front-loading of prenatal care is going to be more expensive, but
... by improving the outcome you'll have fewer babies in intensive
care and they will become more productive members of society.''

   The national police said Wednesday they
had fired 2,075 officers, many for having links to drug
traffickers, and the government urged Colombians to rally behind
its 7-week-old war on cocaine cartels.
   The appeal by President Virgilio Barco's government was issued
Tuesday after the Supreme Court approved an emergency decree that
allows those accused of trafficking by the United States to be
extradited.
   Roman Catholic bishops issued a statement calling the murder of
a Bishop Jesus Emilio Jaramillo, reportedly kidnapped by leftist
guerrillas, ``vile, sacrilegious and pitiless.'' His death
apparently was not connected to the drug war.
   Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla, the national police chief, began an
anti-corruption drive in the 80,000-man force in February, soon
after taking over from a general who was forced out because of
connections with drug traffickers.
   El Tiempo, a Bogota newspaper, said in a story published
Wednesday that 2,075 policemen had been dismissed or forced to
resign for taking bribes from traffickers.
   It said hundreds of others had quit because of low pay or other
complaints. Starting policemen receive about $150 a month.
   Col. Alfredo Salgado of the national police told The Associated
Press the story was accurate.
   The paper quoted Gomez, the police chief, as saying infiltration
by drug rings made the dismissals necessary. El Tiempo said the
general noted ``the drug traffickers' great capacity to bribe at
all levels of national life.''
   In its appeal, the State Security Council _ President Barco,
five Cabinet ministers and the attorney general _ urged Colombians
to resist pressure from the traffickers. It cited bombings,
assassinations and other terrorist acts intended to turn people
against the government.
   The statement said traffickers were trying to create the
impression that the government, by refusing to negotiate with them,
was indirectly responsible for the violence.
   Although there has been no public demand for negotiations with
the drug rings, the subject has become a daily topic of discussion
and many Colombians support such talks.
   Barco and the others said they would not yield to threats and
terrorism and repeated previous vows not to negotiate with the
cartels.
   Reports said the government was preparing to extradite another
drug figure.
   Caracol, a national radio chain, said authorities had completed
the paperwork on Ana Rodriguez de Tamayo, wanted by a federal court
in Miami on charges of conspiracy and drug trafficking. It said she
could be extradited at any time.
   Army Col. Fernando Gonzalez said in an interview broadcast
Tuesday that Bishop Jaramillo was kidnapped Monday in northeastern
Colombia by the National Liberation Army.
   He said the guerrillas apparently wanted to use the bishop to
carry a message to the government, but the colonel did not say why
he thought they killed the cleric.

   Cancer patients who lose hope when standard
treatments fail are fighting to force insurance companies to pay
for drugs and procedures that the insurers call experimental and
beyond their coverage.
   The companies argue that they should not pay for unproven
treatments ordered by researchers investigating new cures.
   The issue has brought together doctors, insurers, lawyers and
judges to determine who gets what kind of care for potentially
fatal diseases.
   The dilemma took on a human face Wednesday when a federal judge
here heard arguments on whether to force a health maintenance
organization to pay for a $75,000-to-$125,000 bone marrow
transplant for a 22-year-old truck driver with testicular cancer.
   Doctors said Dean Weeks of Bernardsville needed the transplant
immediately. Minutes before testimony was to begin, Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute agreed to pay for the treatment
out of charitable funds.
   U.S. District Judge John Bissell said he would hold a hearing on
whether the HMO, Healthways Systems Inc. of Woodcliff Lake, should
be required to reimburse Sloan-Kettering.
   Weeks was diagnosed a year ago and chemotherapy failed to stem
the cancer.
   ``Hopefully, I'll get cured,'' said Weeks, who sat next to his
fiancee during the hearing. ``I don't know what to say. I'm just
glad to have the treatment.''
   His lawyer, Kevin Kovacs, said forcing the hospital to pay for
Weeks could deny a future uninsured patient the chance for
treatment.
   HealthWays' attorney, Jeffrey W. Pagano, argued that forcing the
HMO to fund experimental treatments could harm the quality of basic
care for all its members. Kovacs said the HMO never defined
experimental.
   Weeks needs an autologous bone marrow transplant, in which his
blood cell-producing bone marrow would be temporarily removed so
high levels of chemotherapy can be applied that otherwise could
kill the bone marrow.
   The procedure is considered non-experimental for certain kinds
of cancers, but not others, including testicular cancer. It is used
when standard treatment fails.
   In a parallel case in the same courthouse last spring, U.S.
District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise forced Prudential Insurance
Co. and another firm to pay for the procedure for Nicholae Dosza,
60, of Jefferson Township.
   Some companies have also balked at paying for interleuken and
LAK, or ``killer cell'' therapies, which stimulate the body's own
response to cancer, said John Wingard, an associate professor of
oncology at Johns Hopkins University who treated Dosza.
   The problem is the same for AIDS treatment, in which insurers
lag behind federal approvals for new therapies, said Tom Stoddard,
executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund.
   The insurance industry's cautious approach to new treatments is
not based on monetary concerns, argued Susan Pohli, a Prudential
Insurance Co. spokeswoman.
   ``The issue isn't money, the issue is safety,'' she said.
   Insurers are justified in having a say in whether a treatment is
effective or properly documented, said Jude Payne, a senior policy
analyst for the Health Insurance Association of America.
   A key problem arises when doctors vary drug dosages, or even
uses, beyond uses approved by insurance companies.
   ``It really boils down to what is standard medical practice and
what can be documented as effective,'' said Ms. Payne. ``I think
sometimes there's a little bit of tension there.''
   The insurers also argue that drug-makers seeking profits and
researchers needing data should help pay for experimental
treatments.
   ``It may very well be that in life-threatening situations where
there's no alternative, an exception should be made'' for insurers
to foot the bill even if a therapy is still being investigated,
said Ms. Payne.

   Exiled Panamanians said Wednesday the failed
attempt to topple Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga shows his position is
weakening and vowed the battle will continue.
   All agreed that in the short run at least, the victorious
Noriega will crack down even more on those who defy his authority.
   ``From this point on, there is going to be a lot of oppression
against unallied military officers and against opposition people,''
said Luis Endara, cousin of opposition presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara. ``This is going to be an excuse for Noriega to
retaliate.''
   He said his cousin, now reportedly in hiding somewhere in Panama
City, will continue his highly publicized hunger strike and push
for an economic boycott of the Noriega regime by the people of
Panama.
   Exile groups here say they are receiving desperate messages from
Panama that other civilian political figures, including Raul Ossa,
a vice president of the Christian Democratic Party, are being
rounded up by security police.
   Endara was careful to draw a line between the authors of the
coup attempt and the opposition. He noted the insurgents never
mentioned recognizing the opposition slate as the legitimate
government of Panama, despite unanimity among international
observers that Guillermo Endara won the last presidential election.
   The coup does show that Noriega is losing control of the
military, Endara said.
   ``Over 300 military people are in prison in Panama now,'' Endara
said. ``Obviously, the man is terrified because right now he
doesn't know who is really with him.''
   The coup attempt was the second in 18 months, noted Aurelio
Barria, former head of Panama's Civic Crusade, which organized last
year's domestic opposition to Noriega. He now leads an exile aid
group here.
   ``He hasn't gained support in this period. He has been losing
support,'' Barria said. ``The military institution is
self-destructing.''
   He cautioned, however, that the officers who staged the latest
coup attempt seemed more interested in internal military disputes
than democracy.
   ``It proves that isolated actions are not the solution,'' Barria
said.
   Barria said he did not think the United States should have
intervened directly. But he said his contacts in Panama were
angered that broadcasts from U.S. bases in Panama failed to provide
the populace with information on what was happening, which could
have sparked more public support.
   Endara went further, saying a show of force by U.S. troops could
have tipped the balance in favor of the coup. He said officers on
the fence would have sided against Noriega if they had seen
evidence of military support by the United States.
   They agreed, however, that Noriega's days are numbered.
   ``The fight for democracy is not over yet,'' Barria said. ``And
Noriega has two strikes agaisnt him.''
   To the average Panamanian political exile, the coup failure was
devastating.
   ``My heart fell to my feet,'' said Rita Conte, who said her
excited family had been planning to return home when they thought
the coup was successful.
   While most Panamanians here strongly oppose Noriega, one of his
Miami attorneys, Raymond Takiff, said no one should count the
general out.
   Takiff, who represents the general in his fight against a Miami
drug indictment, said he spoke early Wednesday to the military
ruler's aide Maj. Edgardo Lopez, who had Noriega at his side.
   Takiff said Noriega dismissed talk about dissension in the
military, and he also said the general, contrary to reports
Tuesday, was never hurt or in the custody of the dissidents.

<TEXT>
   PERTH-ANDOVER, New Brunswick (AP) _ A U.S. Air Force tanker jet
exploded in the air Wednesday over Canada, killing at least three
of four crew members, authorities said.
   A panel of military and civilian officials was being assembled
in an attempt to determine what caused the four-engine jet to blow
up and crash, setting fire to woods near this border town, Air
Force officials said.
   The KC-135A tanker was returning from a refueling mission to
Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, Maine, less than 20 miles from
the crash site.
   ``Three bodies have been recovered, but not the fourth,'' said
Capt. Kellie Rebscher, a spokeswoman at Loring.
   Rebscher confirmed that the plane exploded in the air and that
it was not equipped with a ``black box'' that could have recorded
crew members' final words. She said the crew was in radio contact
with the Loring control tower ``a few minutes before the explosion
and they never indicated anything was wrong.''
   Efforts to locate the missing man continued many hours after the
predawn explosion, which witnesses said looked like fireworks and
felt like an earthquake. People living nearby said they heard saw a
flash of light, then smelled burning rubber and diesel fumes.
   ``The noise! My whole house shook _ windows and everything,''
said Anita Davenport, a nearby resident.
   Chunks of twisted metal and other crash debris were scattered
over a wide area, said those who reached the scene before the Air
Force seal it off. The tail of the jet was fairly intact, coming to
rest about a half-mile from the fuselage, which landed in a ravine.
Cold winds dusted the wreckage with a light snow.
   The plane was returning from a refueling mission when it went
down at around 6 a.m. in a heavily wooded valley north of this
community of about 1,900 people, just across the border from Fort
Fairfield, Maine, the Air Force said.
   The jet, which Rebscher said was 25 years old, is a Boeing 707
reconfigured as a tanker for refueling fighters and bombers based
at Loring. An aircraft needing fuel moves in behind the tanker
plane and nuzzles a fuel-receiving arm into a long boom protruding
from a KC-135.
   Rebscher said she was uncertain whether the Loring plane had
unloaded its refueling tanks prior to the explosion. She also said
she did not know the altitude at which the explosion occurred.
   The victims' identities were being withheld pending notification
of relatives.
   Wednesday's explosion was the third crash involving a KC-135
this year.
   On Sept. 20, an Alaska National Guard KC-135 exploded and burned
while taxiing to park at Eielson Air Force Base, killing two
people. On Jan. 31, all 19 people aboard a KC-135 died when it
crashed on takeoff from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. A KC-135
crash in 1988 killed six crewmen at Wurtsmith Air Force Base in
Michigan.
   Ray Gamblin, who owns the woods where the debris came down, said
the plane was ``coming towards our place'' when it exploded.
   ``When you think it could have been one of the planes that carry
nuclear bombs, well, that's pretty scary,'' Gamblin said. ``If it
had gone down 10 seconds later, it would've been right in our
house.''

   Frederick Paxton, a Royal Air Force
aviator who broke the trans-Atlantic speed record in 1945, died of
a heart attack. He was 74.
   He died Tuesday at North Miami Medical Center.
   Paxton was born in New Brunswick, Canada, with a hip disability
and spent his first 12 years bedridden in a body cast. He was left
with a limp.
   ``The war came along and it gave him the opportunity to excel
and be involved,'' said son John Paxton. ``He overcame all his
handicaps by flying.''
   Paxton and Capt. J.G. Naz shaved a minute off the previous
record in May 1945 by flying a twin-engine Mosquito bomber the
2,184 miles from Gander, Newfoundland, to Prestwick, Scotland, in 5
hours, 37 minutes.
   They were delivering the newly built bomber to the front in
World War II. The record would soon fall with the introduction of
jets.
   ``But it was still pretty good,'' said Fred Hotson of the
Canadian Aviation Historical Society. ``The Mosquito bomber was the
fastest thing around the first 2{ years after it was flown for the
first time.''
   Paxton retired to Miami in 1958.
   Survivors include his wife, Vera Viola, and sons John and David
of Hialeah. Private services were planned.

   Engineers replaced a faulty rocket
computer Wednesday, and NASA officially set Oct. 12 for the launch
of space shuttle Atlantis with a nuclear-powered planetary probe.
   Shuttle managers had expected to select that date on Tuesday but
delayed the decision because of a problem in one of two computers
on a rocket intended to boost the Galileo spacecraft toward Jupiter
after it is released in orbit by Atlantis' astronauts.
   The bad computer was replaced by a spare, and NASA reported
initial tests showed it was working fine and that there was no need
to delay the launch. Oct. 12 had been the unofficial date for
several months.
   Liftoff was set for 1:29 p.m.
   Officials said the two computers were supposed to ``talk the
same language'' but they did not because one had a software problem.
   Because Galileo will be powered by two generators fueled by
radioactive plutonium-238 dioxide, three anti-nuclear groups last
week sued in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., in an attempt
to stop the launch.
   The organizations filed briefs with the court Wednesday. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration is scheduled to file
its reply on Friday. Judge Oliver Gasch has set an Oct. 10 hearing.
   The opponents contend that a launch accident could spread
poisonous plutonium over heavily populated east-central Florida.
   NASA says that in tests the plutonium containers have been blown
up, shot at and burned to determine how they would survive
accidents. They have withstood pressures far greater than those
generated in the 1986 explosion of Challenger, the agency said.
   Even if there were a release, NASA said, it ``would have no
appreciable adverse health effects on the population.''
   If they lose the lawsuit, the anti-nuclear activists said they
will try to physically halt the liftoff by trying to infiltrate the
Kennedy Space Center on launch day.

   The owner of the historic Bedford
Springs Hotel said Wednesday he had been notified that a bank will
take control of his debt-ridden, 185-year-old resort.
   Asher Sky, president of Sky Group International Inc., told the
Bedford Gazette that Union National Bank of Pittsburgh told him
Monday that it would take the hotel's title in lieu of foreclosure.
   Donald Malecki, attorney for the bank, declined to comment.
   Sky was unable to meet the Sept. 30 deadline for paying back
$4.8 million to the bank. The money was spent out of a $7.5 million
loan in 1987 for renovations never completed because of a dispute
between owners that ended up in federal bankruptcy court.
   The resort's clubhouse, 244-room hotel and golf course closed
Friday.
   The hotel and 2,300 acres of mountain land were put on the
auction block Sept. 21, but Sky rejected the high bid of $5.3
million as not enough.
   The hotel is a stately stretch of three- and four-story
buildings in the Allegheny Mountains. In its glory days, it
attracted notables including six presidents.

   Two months after his first choice was rejected
by lawmakers, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is still looking for
someone to be the Justice Department's civil rights chief, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
   ``We don't have a short list of candidates,'' said David Runkel,
press secretary for the attorney general. ``It's a difficult
position to fill.''
   The delay in finding a candidate raises the possibility that
President Bush would not have a new nominee for the position before
Congress adjourns later this fall.
   ``The last guy who was nominated for that position took a few
knocks, there are not a lot of people volunteering,'' Runkel said
of the Senate Judiciary Committee's refusal to approve William
Lucas to be assistant attorney general for civil rights.
   About a half-dozen people have been interviewed for the job
since the panel voted Aug. 1 to kill the nomination on a pair of
7-7 votes, Runkel said.
   After those votes, Thornburgh said Lucas was a victim of ``raw
politics'' and accused the Senate Judiciary Committee of
establishing a ``litmus test'' that anyone nominated for the job
must oppose recent Supreme Court decisions on job discrimination.
   But critics contended that Lucas was professionally unqualified
for the job, having never tried a court case and lacking lengthy
experience as a lawyer.
   During his confirmation hearing in July, Lucas stumbled several
times when discussing civil rights cases, confessing at one point
that he was ``new to the law.''
   Several Democratic senators also expressed dismay that Lucas
would not criticize the high court rulings, which civil rights
lawyers say will make it harder to win discrimination cases.
   Lucas stuck close to the Bush administration's policy, saying he
would monitor the impact on those decisions to determine if
legislation were needed to overturn them.
   Justice Department aides argued that Lucas was a victim of
timing as much as anything because he was forced to defend Supreme
Court decisions that were handed down shortly before his
confirmation hearing.
   They argued it was absurd to expect Bush to nominate someone who
didn't agree with his civil rights policies.
   Thornburgh quickly appointed Lucas to head the Justice
Department's Office of Liaison Services _ a post that did not
require Senate confirmation. Lucas' duties include dealing with the
very same civil rights groups that opposed his confirmation.
   On Wednesday, Runkel argued that the rough treatment Lucas
received during his confirmation hearing has hampered efforts to
recruit a new nominee.
   ``It's not an easy position to fill and part of the reason was
the way Bill Lucas was treated,'' Runkel said.
   ``I couldn't accept the notion that Lucas' demise in the
committee makes it difficult to fill the job,'' said Washington
civil rights attorney William Taylor, who lobbied against the
nomination.
   ``There are hundreds of lawyers with civil rights experience in
the country who would not have any difficulty passing muster with
the committee,'' Taylor said.
   The department, which conducts interviews and makes
recommendations to the White House, has not asked the FBI to
conduct background checks on anyone who has been interviewed,
Runkel said.
   The FBI conducts such background checks, which routinely take
several weeks, before a nomination is approved by the White House.
   Once the nomination is made, the Senate Judiciary Committee's
own investigation can delay a vote by the panel and the full Senate
for several weeks, perhaps months.
   The spokesman declined to say whether the difficulty in finding
a candidate means that Bush wouldn't have a nominee ready for
Senate consideration before Congress adjourns this fall.
   The civil rights division, which initiates criminal and civil
cases to enforce anti-discrimination laws, is being run by Acting
Assistant Attorney General James Turner, who took over after the
departure of William Bradford Reynolds, who headed the division
during the Reagan administration.

   An amnesiac was reunited Wednesday with
her Ohio family after a 10-month disappearance but said that for
now she prefers to stay in Nashville rather than return home.
   ``I have a family now. They are very warm people, but I still
have no memory of them,'' said Ruth Ellish, who took the name
``Kitty Jordan'' from a slip of paper she found in her coat pocket.
   Ms. Ellish, of Akron, who still prefers to be called Kitty, met
with her mother and sister at the women's shelter where she has
stayed since arriving mysteriously in Nashville in December.
   She was identified as the 50-year-old divorced mother of three
after relatives saw national news stories about her.
   She plans to return to Nashville after a brief trip to Akron in
two weeks.
   ``I have a family here,'' she said in a news conference at the
Family Life Center, where she has worked as a cooking supervisor.
``They're very supportive. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to
make it. I've been living here, just trying to find a life and a
Social Security number.''
   Ms. Ellish disappeared from Akron on Dec. 8. Two days later,
Kitty awoke in a Nashville motel with a headache and bruises on one
eye, her arms and legs. She did not know how she got to the motel
and could not account for a 24- to 48-hour period.
   Her mother, Irene Christ and sister, Elise White, flew to
Nashville on Wednesday after police matched a missing-person report
from Ohio and the relatives heard her voice on the telephone
earlier this week.
   ``I feel better than I have in the last 10 months,'' Ms. Christ
said after the three spent some time by themselves, looking at
family photographs. ``I never broke down.''
   ``Time will take care of everything,'' Ms. White said. ``We want
her to come home, but we want what's best for her.''
   Ms. Ellish said she did not recognize Ms. Christ and Ms. White
but did not doubt they were her relatives.
   ``I can't put this into focus. It doesn't all register,'' she
said. There's still that feeling of `Why don't I remember?'''
   At the time of her disappearance Ms. Ellish, a telephone company
computer analyst, was having personal problems with her 18-year-old
daughter and was being treated for migraine headaches and stress,
her sister said. She also has two sons, ages 20 and 29.
   Ms. Ellish said doctors told her the memory loss was caused by a
traumatic event and that her memory may return, either gradually or
in a flash.

<HEAD>President Repeats Support For Cutting Capital Gains Tax</HEAD>

   President Bush renewed on Wednesday his push
for a lower capital gains tax, saying it is not ``a tax cut for a
few'' but a way to help ``millions'' of Americans find jobs.
   Bush made the pitch at a Small Business Administration ceremony
honoring minority entrepreneurs.
   He urged the Senate to follow the lead of the House and ``cut
the capital gains tax now.''
   It is not ``a tax cut for a few but ... a tax cut for all, a way
to channel investment back into new growth and new jobs,'' said the
president.
   The major beneficiaries will not be the rich but people
``looking for their first job or perhaps their second job,'' said
Bush. ``It is a job-oriented tax cut.''
   The House last week voted to cut the capital gains tax, now 28
percent to 33 percent, to 19.6 percent for two years and then
provide inflation indexing for new assets subject to the levy.
   Congressional tax experts have said 80 percent of the benefits
would go to people with incomes over $100,000 a year. It would
boost federal revenues in the next three years by $9 billion, but
lose $21 billion over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on
Taxation.
   But Bush disputes those estimates, arguing that by freeing money
for investments, a lower capital gains tax would spur economic
growth and generate more tax revenues.
   Bush said the measure will ``raise employment and raise millions
of our fellow Americans to a new threshold of opportunity.''
   ``The business of America is not businss; the true business is
opportunity,'' he told 150 people at the gathering in the Old
Executive Office Building. No government program ``can match the
opportunity created for all Americans by those special people that
we call entrepreneurs.''
   Bush drew loud applause by promising ``to restore and
reinvigorate the vision behind the Office of Minority Business
Enterprise.''
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and SBA Administrator Susan
Engeleiter joined Bush in presenting awards to:
   _Ronald Thompson, head of General Railroad Equipment and
Services, Inc., of East St. Louis, Mo., as Minority Entrepreneur of
the Year. His company has grouwn fivefold in seven years and now
employs 300 people.
   _Teresa McBride of Albuquerque, N.M., as SBA Minority Small
Business Person of the Year. Her retail consumer electronics
business, McBride Micro Source, has sales of $8.6 million a year.
   _Roy and Rudolph Terry of Terry Manufacturing of Roanoke, Ala.,
as the Graduate of the Year from the SBA's 8a program to help
minority-owned firms get off the ground. Terry, one of three
national uniform suppliers for McDonald's, employs nearly 300
people and has sales exceeding $12 million.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought 100,000 metric
tons of soybean meal and an additional 200,000 tons of corn for
delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The meal and corn were on top of an order for 2 million tons of
corn announced Tuesday. The seventh year of the long-term agreement
between the two countries began Oct. 1.
   U.S. grain sales to Moscow in 1988-89, the sixth year of the
agreement, were a record of more than 21.7 million tons, including
more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4 million tons of
wheat.
   In addition, the 1988-89 sales included 442,500 tons of
soybeans, 1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons
of grain sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 200,000 tons of
corn would be about 7.88 million bushels.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department. No selling prices or further details were released.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.22 per bushel at the
farm, according to USDA's five-day average, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $17.5 million.
   Soybean meal has been selling at wholesale in Illinois at an
equivalent of around $220 per metric ton. That would make the
latest Soviet purchase worth around $22 million at the U.S. plant.

<HEAD>Bush Urges Mobutu to Settle Difference with Angola's Rebel Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday urged Zaire's
President Mobutu Sese Seko to settle his differences with Angolan
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi amid reports that Mobutu has disrupted
the flow of U.S. arms to Savimbi's guerrillas.
   Mobutu was summoned to the White House from New York to discuss
the deterioration in his relations with Savimbi and the faltering
June cease-fire which Zaire mediated between the rebels and
Angola's Soviet-backed government, who have been fighting for 14
years.
   Mobutu, Savimbi and Angola's foreign minister, Pedro van Dunem,
were all in Washington on Wednesday, but none of them met.
   Mobutu returned to New York where he addressed the U.N. General
Assembly on Wednesday afternoon. During Mobutu's speech at the
United Nations, U.N. guards hustled six people out of the visitors'
gallery after they shouted ``Murderer'' at him.
   Savimbi, who leads the Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), is to meet with Bush on Thursday.
   During Bush's 30-minute meeting with Mobutu, ``The president
reiterated the strong U.S. support for UNITA and our appreciation
of President Mobutu's efforts to try to help bring about national
reconciliation in Angola,'' said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   ``The president urged President Mobutu to work out any
differences which he might have with UNITA so that the goal of
national reconciliation can be met,'' he said. Bush will also
``urge him (Savimbi) to work with Mobutu and all the parties
involved.''
   The problem is that UNITA and the Angolan government have
differing views of what reconciliation means. The sides have
refused to sit in the same room. Instead, they have used Mobutu,
other African leaders and the United States as go-betweens.
   Van Dunem, who came to Washington for one day Wednesday to
counter Savimbi's visit, told reporters his government wants
Savimbi to step down and to integrate his forces into the Angolan
armed forces. Once that happens and the civil war ends, multiparty
elections can be discussed, he said.
   ``A multiparty system now is unthinkable,'' he said.
   Van Dunem contended that Savimbi agreed to go into temporary
exile during a closed-door meeting in June with Angolan President
Eduardo dos Santos held in Gbadolite, Zaire, the same place where
they openly agreed to a cease-fire.
   However, Savimbi denied the claim during a news conference,
saying, ``If there was a secret agreement, it was a secret to me
too.''
   He said the first step for Angola must be free elections that
would give UNITA a role in running the country.
   Van Dunem accused Savimbi of reneging on the Gbadolite
agreements, saying Savimbi had come to the United States to ask for
more weapons to augment an estimated $40 million in arms he already
gets annually.
   He said Mobutu, the main channel for American arms supplies to
Savimbi, told the Angolan government he had stopped shipping U.S.
weapons to UNITA before the June accords.
   On Tuesday, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. complained at a hearing of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Mobutu had cut the flow
of U.S. arms to Savimbi's forces, but neither Fitzwater nor Savimbi
would discuss the matter. Mobutu did not talk to the news media
during his brief visit to Washington.
   During his previous visit to Washington in June, Mobutu told
administration officials that U.S. aid to UNITA and Soviet aid to
the Angolan government should both stop to give the Gbadolite
agreements a chance to work.
   But the truce agreement collapsed soon after it was signed, and
Mobutu has been siding with the Angolan government which demanded
that Savimbi step down.
   Mobutu has promised to ask Savimbi to sign a commitment of
temporary exile before an upcoming summit of African leaders in
Gabon, van Dunem said.
   He urged the Bush administration to support the Gbadolite
accords as interpreted by Angola, Mobutu and other African leaders
_ that Savimbi go into exile _ saying he planned to press his case
with Secretary of State James Baker III. Baker has agreed to meet
with van Dunem although the United States and Angola have no
diplomatic relations.
   Van Dunem also accused the administration of reneging on a
promise by former Secretary of State George Shultz that the United
States would establish diplomatic links with the Angolan government
once Angola agreed to the withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops
stationed there.
   The Cuban pullout was agreed to in a U.S.-sponsored agreement
signed last December and about half have left thus far.
   The State Department has denied such a promise was made, saying
the United States would withhold official recognition of Angola
until national reconciliation with UNITA is achieved.

<HEAD>Israeli Soldiers Kill Two Masked Palestinians, Wound Others in Gaza</HEAD>

   Israeli soldiers fired on masked Palestinians
in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, killing two and wounding others,
the army said.
   Arab reporters said some soldiers were disguised as laborers and
drove a private car. The army spokesman's office said the soldiers
were in uniform.
   Also Wednesday, three Palestinians suspected of collaborating
with Israel were reported killed by fellow Arabs. The army
confirmed two of the deaths, one in an Israeli prison camp, and
said it was checking further.
   Sixteen Palestinians in all were reported wounded by Israeli
gunfire in the occupied territories Wednesday.
   Arab reporters in the Gaza Strip said soldiers, operating under
cover, came upon a gang of masked Palestinian youths in Bureij
refugee camp and fired.
   Residents of Bureij identified the dead as Mahmoud Abu Shamala,
22, and Maher Mohammed Al-Makadma, 18, raising to 583 the number of
Palestinians killed by Israelis since the uprising began in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 21 months ago. Forty Israelis
also have died. In addition, 126 Palestinians were killed by fellow
Arabs.
   New army firing orders allow soldiers to fire live ammunition at
masked Palestinians after shouting a warning and firing in the air.
If warnings go unheeded, soldiers can fire at suspects' legs.
Earlier, troops could fire at masked men only if the men were armed.
   In politics, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said he expected Prime
Minster Yitzhak Shamir and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak to hold
a long-awaited first summit. He said no date was set.
   His comment preceded a crucial government meeting on Middle East
peace prospects. The two divided parties in the coalition Cabinet
met separately to outline their strategies for a session of the
inner Cabinet Thursday on Mubarak's offer to arrange an
Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Cairo.
   U.S. officials urge acceptance of Mubarak's efforts as a way to
further Israel's own plan for Middle East peace, including
elections in the occupied territories taken from Jordan and Egypt
in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Israel's left-leaning Labor Party accepts Mubarak's proposal.
   But after senior ministers in Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc met
Wednesday, officials said Likud stood by its rejection of Mubarak's
main ideas.
   Likud rejects Mubarak's call for Israel to accept the
U.S.-backed formula of trading occupied land for peace. Labor,
which arranged to meet Wednesday night in Tel Aviv, supports
land-for-peace and talking to Palestinians outside the occupied
territories.
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon urged Wednesday that at least 300
more Jewish families move into the Moslem quarter of Jerusalem's
Old City, Israel radio reported.
   Sharon, who owns a house in the quarter, made the comment at a
ceremony opening a ``security center'' for self-protection by the
30 Jewish families living there. Sharon's house is under 24-hour
police guard.
   The Old City is part of the territory Israel captured from
Jordan in 1967.

<HEAD>Six Officers Indicted in Dealer's Beating Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six members of Miami's street narcotics unit were
indicted Wednesday on charges they allegedly chased down a drug
dealer and beat him to death after an anonymous tip indicated he
had a murder contract on one of them.
   The federal indictment charged the officers with civil rights
violations resulting in the Dec. 16 death of Leonardo Mercado. Two
of the officers also were accused of beating Mercado about six
weeks before the fatal attack. And all six were charged with
attacking Mercado's stepson, Jose Soto, on the night of the killing.
   State Attorney Janet Reno would not respond when asked if her
department was pursuing state charges.
   A federal magistrate ordered the six officers, who were relieved
of duty after Mercado's death, to post $200,000 personal surety
bond and appear for arraignment Oct. 16.
   The six entered court manacled to each other amid applause from
relatives and friends outside. If convicted, each faces life
imprisonment and a $750,000 fine.
   ``It's a sad day when a federal grand jury must indict six
police officers for intentional use of unreasonable force,'' said
U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   ``This case reminds us that everyone _ president, police
officers, the average citizen _ is subject to the law and will be
prosecuted for deliberate violations of the law,'' he said.
   Miami police cooperated with the federal investigation and
expected the indictment.
   ``We're saddened by the experience, but we must go out and
perform our duties in a professional manner and continue to serve
the community,'' said Police Chief Perry Anderson.
   The indictment alleges that about six weeks before the fatal
attack, officers Pablo Camacho and Andy Watson beat Mercado, 35, at
a game room near his apartment. It then alleges that all six
officers were on their way to a drug sting on Dec. 16 when they
allegedly detoured to Mercado's apartment and attacked him and his
stepson. Mercado died hours later.
   Reports had been circulating around the department for a few
days that an anonymous tip indicated Mercado had targeted Camacho
for murder.
   All six officers were charged with conspiracy to threaten and
intimidate Mercado by use of unreasonable force under color of law
and civil rights violations in the death of Mercado and the attack
on Soto. Camacho and Watson were charged with a civil rights
violation in the November beating of Mercado.
   The officers charged and their experience with the department
are: Camacho, 42, 13 years; Charlie Haynes, 30, 10 years; Ronald
Sinclair, 46, seven years; Thomas Trujillo, 31, nine years;
Nathaniel Veal Jr., 31, eight years; and Watson, 32, nine years.
   The indictment of the six officers is the second scandal within
the Miami Police department in five years. A band of 15 officers
was charged with running a drug-ripoff ring that was blamed for the
drownings of three drug boat guards in 1985.

<HEAD>Bridge Linking Islands and Mainland Lifted Out of Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bridge that is the only land link
between the mainland and homes on two barrier islands on Wednesday
was hoisted out of the Intracoastal Waterway, where it was dumped
by Hurricane Hugo.
   Officials of hard-hit Charleston put out the word that they want
tourists to start coming back to the historic city.
   Officials hoped to open the Ben Sawyer Bridge to traffic by
Thursday, giving residents of the Isle of Palms and Sullivan's
Island land access to their homes for the first time since the
killer storm struck on Sept. 21.
   Hugo's 135-mph wind wrenched the 500,000-ton swing bridge,
leaving it tipped at a 45-degree angle, leaning on its center
support pier with one end submerged in the water.
   The bridge was lifted out of the water by a crane mounted on a
barge.
   Highway officials said they would inspect the bridge before
declaring it safe for traffic. Since the storm, the only access to
the islands has been by boat or helicopter.
   Dozens of spectators watched the bridge operation in small boats
stopped in the waterway.
   Others watched from the shoreline at the Toler's Cover marina
and condominium complex, where the storm ripped the roofs off some
units and tossed boats around the parking lot.
   Among them was Melvin Anderegg, mayor of Sullivan's Island.
   Residents were again living on the island and power and water
has been restored, although the water has not yet been approved for
drinking, he said.
   ``The people want to get back to their homes and get started
digging out,'' Anderegg said. ``Everywhere you look over there are
people cleaning up and moving things.''
   The mayor estimated that between 100 and 150 of the
approximately 850 houses on the island are not habitable. Many of
them are rental and vacation homes.
   The South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. said about two-thirds of
the utility's 158,000 customers in the metropolitan Charleston area
had power restored by late Tuesday. Power was restored by Wednesday
to almost all customers in other areas of the state, power company
officials said.
   Hurricane Hugo slammed into the South Carolina coast Sept. 21,
killing at least 18 and damaging and destroying homes, businesses,
schools and municipal buildings as far inland as Sumter and north
to North Carolina. In all, 29 people were killed on the U.S.
mainland.
   Damage in South Carolina has been estimated at $3 billion or
more.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened two additional
disaster assistance centers Wednesday in South Carolina, making a
total of 16 centers where people can apply for emergency grants and
loans. In addition, it is now operating a telephone hotline and
applications may be submitted over the phone, said Paul Hall,
FEMA's coordinating officer for the hurricane recovery.
   The Red Cross announced Wednesday that only seven storm
evacuation shelters housing 454 people remain open around the
state, down from 10 shelters Tuesday. Since the storm approached,
453 shelters have housed 87,230 people.
   Even while the cleanup continued, officials urged visitors to
return to historic Charleston.
   ``We plan to go to every city in America that sent aid to
Charleston and go on their media and thank them and tell them
Charleston is open for business,'' said Tom Blazer, chairman of the
Charleston Trident Chamber of Commerce.
   Ninety percent of the area's hotels and restaurants should be
open by mid-October.
   The tourism industry is worth $4.9 billion to the local economy,
Blazer said.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. also urged visitors to return.
   ``We've bounced back from Hurricane Hugo and visitors should not
cancel their plans to come to Charleston but should come right
ahead,'' the mayor said. A 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew should be lifted
soon.
   Meanwhile, a coalition of Charleston area groups announced plans
to begin replacing millions of acres of trees devastated by Hugo.
The effort, dubbed Lowcountry Releaf, will collect funds to buy
seedlings and distribute trees between Thanksgiving and Arbor Day,
Dec. 1.

<HEAD>Old-Time Cajun Fiddler Dead at 96</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EUNICE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dennis McGee, a master fiddler who played on
some of the earliest recordings of Cajun music, has died of natural
causes. He was 96.
   McGee performed on the radio show ``Prairie Home Companion'' and
often played at festivals and on college campuses around the
country well into his 90s.
   The Eunice resident died Tuesday in Savoy Medical Center in
Mamou. Funeral services were scheduled for Thursday at Emanuel
Baptist Church in Eunice.
   McGee played with such Cajun artists as Amede Ardoin, Joe Falcon
and Amede Breaux when the music was first being recorded in the
late 1920s.
   ``He was very well-known and very much respected in lots of
different circles around the country and none of that affected
him,'' said Barry Ancelet, a chronicler of the Cajun culture and
history.
   ``Dennis McGee was around when what we now call Cajun music was
invented, or was developing,'' Ancelet said. ``Because of how he
learned and who he learned from, he was one of the last living
links to our musical past.''

   The principal tasks of the nearly 13,000 U.S.
military forces in Panama are to protect both the Panama Canal and
the estimated 40,000 American civilians living in that country.
   These forces are precluded from involvement in Panamanian
internal affairs but Panamanian officials have said U.S. troops
frequently have been used in maneuvers designed to intimidate the
government.
   Under the Panama Canal treaties, U.S. forces are allowed to
patrol only their own bases and areas under joint U.S.-Panamanian
jurisdiction.
   There were about 10,800 U.S. military personnel in Panama early
this year but President Bush augmented that number by 2,000 after a
post-election outbreak of violence in Panama.
   The U.S. Southern Command, responsible for all U.S. military
activities in Central and South America, is headquartered at Quarry
Heights, one of 10 major military installations in Panama.

<TEXT>
   Cypriot President George Vassiliou conferred
with President Bush on Wednesday and said he is willing to
demilitarize Cyprus if Turkey withdraws its troops from the island.
   Vassiliou met in the Oval Office with Bush, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and
Bush's special Cyprus negotiator, Nelson Ledsky.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said afterwards
that Bush reaffirmed U.S. support for U.N. efforts to negotiate a
solution to the Cyprus problem. Bush ``expressed his hope that the
talks will be resumed at the earliest possible date,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Vassiliou, speaking with reporters on the White House driveway,
called it ``an extremely good meeting. ... I'm extremely
satisfied.''
   He said Bush ``made it quite clear ... that he does not consider
the status quo as a solution.''
   Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 and in 1983 Turkish Cypriots
declared a breakaway republic in their third of the eastern
Mediterranean island. Turkey still has 30,000 troops on the island,
where U.N. peacekeeping forces help keep the peace between the
majority Greek Cypriots and the Turkish minority.
   Vassiliou said his government has been building up its military
for defensive purposes, but he insisted its army of 10,000 to
12,000 conscripts is no match for the Turkish forces.
   He repeated a challenge first delivered earlier in the day in a
speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
   ``I challenge the Turkish government. If they're really worried
about our building up our defenses, let's demilitarize. We are
ready to do that any moment,'' he said.
   ``Let's start: they withdraw their armies, we dismantle our army
and also give away all our guns, and let's have Cyprus
demilitarized under any kind of guarantees.''
   Vassiliou called upon leaders of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots
to ``stop making difficulties and sit down and talk.
   ``I would like to give this message to the Turkish people: It's
an anachronism to have the Cyprus issue open. It helps nobody. It
causes pain to all of us. And it costs a lot of money that we could
use much better for the benefit of our people.
   ``Cyprus with its problems would be a good friend of Turkey,
would be a place where Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots would
feel happy and will contriute significantly to peace in the
region,'' he said.
   He said the impoverished Turkish Cypriot community had the most
to gain from a solution.
   Vassiliou gave Bush a gift of an ancient vase from Cyprus,
dating to 600 B.C.
   ``Six hundred B.C.!'' exclaimed Bush, displaying the heirloom
for cameras.
   ``Six hundred B.C., yes,'' said Vassiliou, joking, ``It's maybe
580 or 620.''
   ``It looks like about 590 B.C.,'' cracked Bush.

<TEXT>
   A coalition of citizens' groups sought a court
order Wednesday to delay the scheduled Oct. 12 launch of a
nuclear-powered probe from the space shuttle.
   The danger of plutonium contamination from a shuttle disaster is
far greater than the government has admitted, the Florida Coalition
for Peace and Justice and two other organizations said in U.S.
District Court.
   The groups, which filed suit Sept. 28, made formal requests for
a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to stop
the launch of the Shuttle Atlantis which is to carry the Galileo
probe into space.
   In a 37-page court brief, the groups said a number of scientists
are counseling against making the launch.
   Richard Cuddihy, a leading expert on radiation poisoning, wrote
the White House last month, saying the launch puts large numbers of
people at risk, the court papers said.
   Cuddihy also is a member of the Interagency Nuclear Safety
Review Panel which is composed of representatives of NASA, the
Department of Energy and the Defense Department.
   Cuddihy estimated the cost in human lives and cleanup of a
Galileo explosion would be many times higher than that admitted by
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   He recommended that these types of missions be launched on
unmanned rockets from remote locations.
   The court filing also said that:
   _ Robert Weatherwax, a leading authority on the dangers of the
space shuttle, has called the Galileo launch irresponsible. He
estimates the possibilities of an accident and a deadly plutonium
release from Galileo are 1-in-350.
   NASA says the highest probability of launch area release of
plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 1-in-2,500.
   _ Horst Poehler, a longtime consultant for NASA contractors, has
challenged the risk assessments of NASA. Poehler said NASA has not
made public for comment the assumptions and details of the agency's
calculations for nuclear release or individual per person doses of
radiation for various types of accidents.
   Once in orbit, Galileo is to rocket itself on a round-about
voyage to Jupiter. Powering the craft are two radioisotope
thermoelectric generators. Each of the RTGs are energized by 24.7
pounds of plutonium-238.
   The suit said the Galileo project will condemn thousands of
eastern Florida residents ``to a wholly unnecessary and virtual
certainty of contracting cancer'' if a shuttle launch accident,
similar to the one that destroyed Challenger in 1986, caused the
plutonium to be vaporized and spread over the area.
   Joining the filing of the suit were the Foundation on Economic
Trends and the Christic Institute.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with refugees leaving the U.S. Embassy, diplomats
saying East Berlin promises to look favorably on their requests to leave.

   Eighteen East Germans who occupied the U.S.
Embassy in an effort to flee to the West left the compound late
Wednesday with assurances their government will look favorably on
their emigration requests, diplomats said.
   Earlier in the day, East German police cordoned off the embassy
in East Berlin and scuffled with about 50 other refugees also
hoping to gain sanctuary there.
   Elsewhere, thousands of other East Germans lined railroad tracks
with packed bags and children in tow, hoping to jump aboard trains
carrying their countrymen to the West from Prague, Czechoslovakia,
witnesses said. The trains were to pass through East Germany on
their way to Hof, West Germany.
   East Germany reluctantly agreed to allow the exodus, the second
in the last four days, after thousands of its citizens flooded
embassies in Prague and Warsaw, Poland.
   Wednesday's scuffle in East Berlin came a day after the 18 East
Germans moved into the embassy and refused to leave until they were
given permission to emigrate from their Communist homeland.
   According to a statement from the U.S. Embassy, those 18 agreed
to leave the mission Wednesday night and went home. East German
officials have promised to ``examine ... with goodwill'' their
emigration applications, the statement said.
   Western diplomats in East Berlin said they assume the group will
soon be permitted to leave for West Germany, though it was not
clear if East German authorities explicitly made such a promise.
   After agreeing to the latest rail exodus, the hard-line East
Berlin government on Tuesday closed its border with Czechoslovakia.
That is the only country where East Germans could freely travel
without government permission.
   That closure and the sanctioned exodus from Prague has triggered
a flood of other East Germans desperately trying to take part in
the mass transfer.
   Witnesses said about 100 East German police scuffled with about
50 would-be emigres in front of the U.S. Embassy, preventing their
entry. There were no reports of injuries.
   Western reporters saw at least 12 people taken away in police
vans, among them a young mother and three wailing children.
   The embassy was circled by police, and passers-by were checked
for documents and told to leave the area. On the corner of the
nearby central thoroughfare, Unter den Linden, scores of onlookers
gathered to watch.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Verner said the 18 East Germans _
10 adults and eight children _ were holed up in the embassy since
late Tuesday.
   Before leaving, the refugees were staying in a cramped room just
off the embassy entrance lobby. They were mostly couples in their
20s and many had small children and babies in strollers and baskets.
   ``This is our last hope,'' one refugee had said. ``We're not
going to budge until we know we'll be able to leave.''
   Diplomatic sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said four East German refugees fled to the West German diplomatic
mission in East Berlin.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of
the refugee influx: ``We're talking to the East Germans about it
and trying to get them to help resolve the problem through their
immigration policies.''
   Hungarian and West German media reported that thousands more had
crowded other spots along the route the trains are taking through
East Germany. Many had their belongings packed and were hoping to
jump on the trains, as many did during last weekend's exodus.
   In Dresden, witnesses said police used truncheons to clear about
5,000 East Germans from the city's central station who gathered
since Tuesday in hopes of climbing on the western-bound trains.
   After being forced out of the station, witnesses said more then
5,000 people stretched in a line along the tracks. The crowd
dispersed by early Wednesday after learning the trains from Prague
were delayed.
   During last weekend's exodus of about 7,000 East Germans,
several managed to board a train in Dresden as it passed.
   Police officials in the West German border town of Hof, where
the refugees were to arrive, said about 1,000 young East Germans
were waiting along the tracks near Plauen, an East German town near
the Czechoslovak border.
   The embarassing exodus comes as East German plans a weekend
celebration of its 40th anniversary, to be attended by Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

<TEXT>
   A Cypriot oil tanker leaked
about 350 barrels of oil into the Indian Ocean that on Wednesday
had formed a slick 14 miles long off southern Africa, news agencies
reported.
   The independent South African Press Association quoted Capt.
P.H. Kroon of the Transport Department's marine division as saying
a strong southerly current would keep the slick away from the coast.
   It quoted R.C. van der Krol, port captain of East London, as
saying the tanker Pacificos spilled the oil about 25 miles south of
East London and that he did not know the ship's port of origin or
its destination.
   Government television said the oil was leaking from a 50-foot
gash just above the water line in the midsection of the 26,800-ton
tanker, but did not say how or when the damage occurred.
   It said the captain notified authorities Wednesday afternoon and
a coast guard plane flew over the slick, which the television said
was three miles wide at some points.
   SAPA quoted a spokesman for Pentow Marine, a Cape Town salvage
company, as saying a coast guard anti-pollution vessel was in the
vicinity and another was on its way. The spokesman, not identified,
said the tanker was carrying 10,000 tons of oil and that a salvage
tug was to reach it by Thursday afternoon.

<HEAD>Florida Blood Bank To Begin Reporting AIDS Carriers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-AIDS-Blood, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blood bank plans to start reporting the
names of AIDS carriers to health authorities who in turn will try
to trace the patient's sexual contacts, officials said.
   ``We don't want people with AIDS or people at high risk for AIDS
donating blood,'' said Ken Wiebeck, spokesman for the Southwest
Florida Blood Bank. ``It's not right, it's not safe. The safety of
the public is of primary importance.''
   Also, the blood bank wants to discourage people from using
donations as a way to get a free, confidential AIDS test.
   ``One of our fears is that people may be donating blood to get a
confidential test for AIDS,'' said Dr. Paul Schmidt, director of
the blood bank and a recent past president of the American
Association of Blood Banks.
   A spokesman for AIDS patients advised caution in reporting names.
   ``Passing along names would scare people,'' said Chuck Kuehn,
executive director of the Tampa AIDS Network. ``They would have
achieved their purpose but I don't agree with their tactics.''
   The Tampa blood bank is considered among the most aggressive in
the country in trying to prevent AIDS carriers from donating blood.
In March 1988, the bank became one of two in the United States to
start interviewing donors to identify high-risk applicants. A San
Bernardino, Calif., blood bank was the other.
   Donors will be told of the policy and asked to sign a form
acknowledging they were so advised. If tests show young donors, 17
or 18, carry the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the blood bank will notify
their parents or guardian.
   Dr. Don Kwalick, director of the Hillsborough County Health
Department, said his employees intend to follow the same procedures
they use in tracing contacts of patients with other sexually
transmitted diseases. Names from the blood bank would be used as
one source of information in tracing contacts.
   He said recently passed laws let the department include AIDS
patients in the tracing, but that state Health and Rehabilitative
Services officials have to give their permission.
   The Health Department offers anonymous and confidential AIDS
testing.
   The blood bank has been identifying between one and two donors
that test positive for the AIDS virus for every 10,000 units of
blood donated. That is about what would be expected nationally,
Wiebeck said.
   In the interview process, potential donors are asked a series of
questions instead of simply being asked to complete a form saying
they do not fall into high-risk categories.
   The Tampa data showed 62 donors out of the approximately 36,000
seen since the questioning began were ``deferred'' because they
gave a positive response to a question.
   The questions include:
   Have you had sexual contact with prostitutes in the past six
months?
   Have you had clinical or laboratory evidence of AIDS infection
or had sexual contact with someone who has?
   Have you engaged in male homosexual activity or had sexual
contact with someone who had?
   Two additional questions ask about intravenous drug use and
whether the donor has immigrated from Haiti or west or central
Africa since 1977 or had sexual contact with an immigrant from
those regions.

<HEAD>State School Board Approves Jersey City Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MARTELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JAMESBURG, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state superintendent took control of
Jersey City's faltering public schools Wednesday, completing a
five-year legal struggle that ended in the nation's largest state
takeover of an urban school district.
   Jersey City students have been subjected to ``educational child
abuse,'' said Gov. Thomas H. Kean. ``Now the community can put
politics and patronage aside, and get on with the business of
learning.''
   The state had cited political intrusion in hiring practices,
poor test scores, failure to provide a safe, clean environment for
students, violations of bidding laws, failure to provide for
handicapped children and unauthorized use of state funds as some of
the reasons for the takeover.
   On Wednesday, the state Board of Education in Jamesburg gave
final approval to the takeover and formally appointed Elena J.
Scambio to a three-year term as superintendent of the school
district.
   Ms. Scambio's first act was to abolish the jobs of seven top
administrators in the district, including that of school
Superintendent Franklin Williams. The state board's action also
officially disbanded the Jersey City Board of Education.
   A new board is expected to be appointed by state Education
Commissioner Saul Cooperman by December.
   Ms. Scambio, a former Essex County school superintendent who has
been preparing for the transition since August, promised to
``unravel the quagmire that exists in Jersey City'' and make the
city a national model of urban education.
   Under New Jersey's takeover law, the state has five years to
make improvements. National education groups say they will closely
monitor the progress of the takeover.
   The move gives the state extraordinary powers in Jersey City,
the state's second largest district with 28,000 students.
   Ms. Scambio said other immediate changes may include trimming
from 100 to 150 staff positions, streamlined management, physical
improvements to schools and better community relations.
   The Jersey City school system has a staff of 3,322 and a budget
for the current year of about $180 million. Enrollment is 44
percent black, 34 percent Hispanic and 13 percent white.
   The board's decision was expected and ends a bitter legal battle
by the state to take over the schools, a process strongly pushed by
Kean, who has billed himself as ``the education governor.''
   State board Vice President Robert A. Woodruff, reading a
resolution, said ``the district's problems were deep-rooted and
endemic. The Jersey City board of education totally failed to meet
its obligations.''
   This summer, Administrative Law Judge Kenneth Springer agreed
with the argument of state officials in his decision to grant the
state power to take over the district.
   Springer noted that some textbooks used in Jersey City
classrooms are more than 30 years old.
   Jersey City officials bitterly fought the takeover effort,
saying the problems were caused by a prior administration and that
the state trumped up its case against the district.
   Williams, who was relieved as school superintendent but can
still teach in the district, released a statement Wednesday
criticizing the takeover effort.
   ``In a society that offers little enough to bolster the
self-confidence of urban children, the campaign to take over the
Jersey City schools has only further lowered the self-image of our
students,'' Williams said.
   Williams said test scores have climbed in recent years, and one
of the district's high schools was one of only five in the state
with a 100 percent passing rate on the high school proficiency test.
   Local officials had at first sought to rally public opinion
against the intervention but found little political support. Former
Mayor Anthony Cuccio, who opposed the takeover, lost his seat in
May to Gerald McCann, who said he would not oppose the move.
   ``It should have happened much sooner, I think,'' said Samir
Skular, 31, a 31-year-old city resident with two daughters in the
public schools. ``It was just politicians trying to protect their
jobs and not thinking about kids.''
   Jean McDonald, a researcher for the National Governors'
Association, said Kentucky, South Carolina, Texas and New Mexico
have laws allowing state takeovers of failing school districts.
   In Kentucky, the state school board has taken limited control of
three county districts under an ``academic bankruptcy'' law enacted
by the General Assembly in 1988.

<TEXT>
   Heckled by Iran, Lebanese legislators
met on Wednesday and debated scrapping a 46-year-old pact that
divides government jobs along sectarian lines.
   They agreed earlier to revamp Parliament with an equal number of
Moslems and Christians in an effort to end the 14-year-old civil
war.
   Any agreement, however, must win the support of powerful
warlords who have controlled much of Lebanon since fighting began
in 1975. Moslem militia leaders Nabih Berri and Walid Jumblatt
reportedly gave negative assessments of the Taif efforts on
Wednesday.
   Militia leaders have been kept away from the meeting.
   The conflict is a battleground for conflicting Arab interests as
well as for Lebanese factions. The war has killed at least 150,000
people and turned much of the capital, Beirut, into rubble.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani warned the legislators
Wednesday not to surrender to domination by Maronite Catholics.
   ``If they give in, they have done a great treason to the
Lebanese people, and should be seriously confronted,'' the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted Rafsanjani as saying.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati earlier Wednesday
rejected decisions taken by the legislators on grounds they failed
to hand over the bulk of political power to Moslems.
   In Beirut, two foreign passenger jets _ an Aeroflot flight from
Moscow and a French airliner _ landed at the airport Wednesday, the
first since the airport reopened nearly two weeks ago after a
cease-fire that ended six months of shelling duels between Moslem
and Christian militias.
   Thirty-three Christian and 30 Moslem legislators, representing
all but 10 of the body's surviving 73 members, met for a fifth day
to discuss reforms aimed at ending the war.
   They agreed Tuesday to expand the 99-seat Parliament and to
ensure an equal distribution between Christians and Moslems.
   The last official census conducted in 1932 showed Christians
made up a majority of the population, but later estimates say
Moslems make up 55 percent of Lebanon's 4 million people.
   On Wednesday, the deputies talked of using a merit system to
fill government jobs.
   Sources at the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said all deputies opposed continuing the present sectarian system
but differed on how and when to change it.
   Some Christian speakers made reform conditional on a withdrawal
of Syrian forces from Lebanon, the sources said.
   Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal and other mediators
met Christian deputies, apparently to try to persuade them to drop
this condition.
   Deputies also discussed possible expansion of the premier's
powers at the expense of the president.
   Under an unwritten 1943 national covenant, power was shared by a
Maronite Catholic president, a Sunni Moslem premier and a Shiite
Moslem Parliament speaker, with top government, army and public
administration posts going to the Maronites.
   One Parliament member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
abolishing political factionalism ``is an issue too explosive for
the parliamentarians to handle without the prior consent of the
warlords who control the Lebanese arena.''
   Iran's state-run news agency IRNA said Rafsanjani's statement
came after he met in Tehran with four Lebanese Moslem leaders:
Berri, leader of the Shiite Amal movement; Jumblatt, the Druse
chieftain; Sheik Subhi Tufaili, a leader of the Shiite Hezbollah,
or Party of God; and Sheik Saeed Shaaban, head of a Syrian- and
Libyan-backed Sunni fundamentalist faction.
   Velayati told a news conference in Tehran ``we can place no hope
in the Taif meeting,'' Iranian TV reported.
   ``Since the majority of the Lebanese people are Moslems, it is
natural that the principal rule in Lebanon must be in the hands of
Moslems,'' he said.
   ``If any decision is made at Taif or elsewhere that contradicts
this basic principle ... it will not be accepted by the Moslem and
nationalist forces, and it will be rejected by Iran and Syria,''
Velayati said.
   The broadcast and IRNA dispatch were monitored in Cyprus.
   Jumblatt and Berri say Syrian troops are needed to guarantee a
settlement.
   Iranian TV said Amal issued a statement saying the Taif meeting
will not reach a just solution to Lebanon's crisis.
   In Beirut, the Christian-run Voice of Lebanon quoted Jumblatt as
saying a cease-fire that began late last month was just an
``intermission'' in the war.
   Iran is a major backer of Shiites in Lebanon, who are estimated
to be the largest sect there.
   Supporters of Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun, a Maronite,
demand a timetable for a pullout of Syria's 40,000 troops from
Lebanon before considering political reforms.
   If agreement is reached on reforms, the Lebanese parliament
would convene in Beirut to ratify them formally, with a tentative
date set at Oct. 21.

   Members of the Irish Republican
Army on Wednesday shot and killed a Roman Catholic after mistaking
him for a Protestant gunman, police said.
   The victim, 52-year-old James Henry Babbington, was shot
point-blank by two men outside a primary school, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said.
   In a statement to local news media, the predominantly Catholic
IRA claimed it killed a gunman who was involved in several attacks
against IRA members. The IRA statement gave a name of the purported
victim, but it was not Babbington.
   ``The victim was an entirely innocent man who was on his way to
work,'' the Constabulary said in a statement late Wednesday.
   ``The fact that the shooting appears to have been carried out
before the horrified gaze of young children speaks volumes for the
sick mentality of the murderers,'' said Alban McGuinness, chairman
of the Social Democratic and Labor Party. It is the largest
predominantly Catholic party in the province.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said the man
identified by the IRA was taken into protective custody. A
Constabulary press officer declined to comment on that report.
   The outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force, an extremist Protestant
group, claimed responsibility for another shooting Wednesday in
north Belfast. The victim, who suffered shoulder and leg injuries,
was related to a prominent member of Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal
political wing, police said.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the 60 percent Protestant province with the 95 percent
Catholic Irish Republic.
   Twenty years of violence have claimed 2,758 lives in Northern
Ireland, 47 of them this year.

<HEAD>Jackson `Ready to Roll' in Atlanta; Phoenix Mayor Ponders Mixed Message</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlanta Mayor-elect Maynard Jackson prepared to trade places for
a second time with Mayor Andrew Young, while Phoenix Mayor Terry
Goddard pondered the mixed message contained in his landslide
re-election.
   ``We're ready to roll,'' Jackson said after his own overwhelming
victory Tuesday, which made him the city's first three-term black
mayor. ``I'm eager to get to it.''
   Goddard said he would try to figure out why voters rejected his
plans for a downtown baseball stadium even as they returned him to
office for a third term.
   Atlanta's city charter prohibited Young, the former United
Nations ambassador, from seeking a third consecutive term as mayor,
just as it prohibited Jackson from seeking a third straight term
eight years ago.
   Young plans to run for governor next year, while Jackson will
resume leadership at City Hall. He was in Chicago on Wednesday, but
campaign officials said he would announce the members of his
transition staff on Thursday.
   Jackson won Tuesday by a nearly 5-1 margin over civil rights
activist Hosea Williams. In final, unofficial returns, Jackson had
54,897 votes, or 79 percent, to 11,1116, or 16.5 percent, for
Williams. Four other candidates shared 4.5 percent of the vote.
   Goddard beat his nearest rival in Phoenix, state Republican
Party Chairman Burton Kruglick, by nearly a 2-to-1 margin, while
voters spurned the proposed baseball stadium by a 3-to-2 margin. It
was the latest in a series of rejections for large public works
projects that Goddard has supported.
   Goddard conceded that he was responsible for selling his
projects to the public. ``Obviously, we haven't done that,'' he
said.
   The Phoenix and Atlanta elections were among several Tuesday.
Among the others:
   _ In Mississippi, a Democratic state senator and a Republican
political aide are gearing up for an Oct. 17 runoff in their race
to fill the seat left vacant by the late Rep. Larkin Smith, who
died in a plane crash.
   Democrat Gene Taylor claimed 42 percent of the vote Tuesday and
Republican Tom Anderson received 37 percent to win spots in the
runoff. State Attorney General Mike Moore trailed with 21 percent.
   _ Albuquerque, N.M., Mayor Ken Schultz was turned out of office,
prompting one of the candidates who beat him, Louis Saavedra, to
say that voters ``are fed up with all the politics that go on at
City Hall.''
   Schultz received just 10 percent of the vote in his defeat at
the hands of Saavedra and Pat Baca, who will face each other in a
runoff that must be held within 30 days. No mayor has been elected
to back-to-back terms since Albuquerque enacted a mayor-council
form of government in 1974.
   _ Cleveland voters will elect the city's second black mayor on
Nov. 7 after City Council President George Forbes and his youthful
former protege, state Sen. Mike White, defeated three rivals to
advance to a runoff.
   _ In Escondido, Calif., pro-choice advocate Tricia Hunter won a
vacant state Assembly seat by defeating a Democratic opponent and
turning back a strong write-in campaign by an anti-abortion
advocate she beat in the Republican primary.

<TEXT>
   A woman who fatally stabbed her two young
daughters, then forced her 8-year-old son to kill her with the same
knife had threatened last month to poison all four of her children,
a social services lawyer said Wednesday.
   The allegation came to light in a Juvenile Court custody hearing
the day after Marie King killed her 3- and 4-year-old daughters
with a 10-inch kitchen knife and ordered her son to stab her,
investigators said.
   The woman's husband, Christopher King, called the state
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services last month, saying
she had threatened to poison all four children, said Pablo Perez, a
department lawyer.
   Mrs. King, 32, denied the threat when confronted by social
workers, Perez said.
   Christopher King then refused state services, saying he needed
his wife at home to take care of the children while he worked, said
Ruben Betancourt, a spokesman for the department.
   The department's investigation remained open, and Betancourt
said agency procedures were followed.
   ``We started an investigation at the father's request on the
accusation that the mother was threatening the children. We went
and talked to the mother, talked to the father, talked to the
children, who were happy, well-fed,'' Betancourt said.
   Neighbors said Mrs. King rarely left the two-bedroom house since
the family moved in a few months ago. Her husband attended two
neighborhood Crime Watch meetings, and the children frequently were
seen playing outside.
   Judge Seymour Gelber said the agency's handling of the matter
was appropriate. ``It appears HRS did what it should have done,''
he said. ``So this was not a case where HRS failed to follow up.''
   The state agency went to court Wednesday for custody of the
8-year-old and his 6-year-old brother after the father refused to
allow medical and psychological evaluations of the boys, Perez said.
   The judge granted the agency custody, and the boys were placed
in a temporary state shelter, Betancourt said.

   A jury Wednesday began deliberating the
fraud and conspiracy charges against PTL founder Jim Bakker and
must decide if he is the ``world-class'' con man prosecutors
contend, or the victim of circumstance his lawyers say.
   Bakker is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million in PTL
money to live in high style, buying Rolls-Royces, lavish homes, raw
diamonds, an air-conditioned doghouse and furnishings ranging from
mirrored walls and gold-plated swan bathroom fixtures to motorized
bedroom drapes and gigantic walk-in closets.
   ``I feel fine,'' Bakker said as he and his wife, Tammy Faye,
left the federal courthouse. Asked if he was worried about the
outcome, Bakker responded, ``No I'm trusting God.''
   ``Last night, we had a great dinner together,'' he said. ``We
slept like babies,'' Mrs. Bakker added.
   The jury returned to the courtroom several times after getting
the case Wednesday morning. One of the jurors' requests was for
evidence relating to wire fraud charges.
   The jury also asked U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter for
clarification of a charge, two boxes of government exhibits and an
explanation of federal statutes relating to mail and wire fraud and
conspiracy.
   The jury recessed its deliberations at 6 p.m.
   Bakker, 49, is charged in U.S. District Court with 15 counts of
wire fraud, eight counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy
to commit wire and mail fraud.
   Prosecutors contend that Bakker solicited money for ``lifetime
partnerships'' at his Heritage USA retreat near Fort Mill, S.C.,
but used the the money for projects other than the lodging he
promised. Lifetime partners typically paid $1,000 for the promise
of three nights and four days annually at the theme park. Bakker
raised $158 million through partnership sales.
   He resigned from the ministry in 1987 amid a sex and money
scandal.
   Potter instructed the jury Tuesday night after closing arguments.
   ``You can't lie to people to send you money _ it's that
simple,'' prosecutor Deborah Smith told the jury.
   ``You can't tell half-truths. If you do it, if you use the
postal service and the public airwaves you will find yourself in
federal court answering charges of mail and wire fraud. That's why
we're here today, because that's just what Mr. Bakker did.''
   Bakker's attorneys said he was a victim of circumstances and a
minister worried about the survival of his church.
   ``I think 95 percent of the evidence in this case by the
government is circumstantial,'' said defense attorney George Davis.
   ``The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defendant had specific intent to commit fraud,'' Davis said. ``He
was conducting a ministry. He was doing what he thought was vital
to the survival of his ministry.''
   Smith insisted that the case was about money, not religion:
``What unfolded before you over the past month was a tale of
corruption _ immense corruption. ... What was revealed here was
that Mr. Bakker was a world-class master of lies and half-truths.''
   If convicted on all counts, Bakker faces up to 120 years in
prison and more than $5 million in fines.

   U.S. troops in Panama were ordered to restrict
their movements for a second day Wednesday although streets were
calm following a failed attempt to oust Panamanian leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Maj. Kathy Wood, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the order
requiring American troops to stay on U.S. facilities remained in
effect as a precautionary measure.
   The 12,000 troops are ``going about their normal business'' to
the extent possible under the restrictions, put in place Tuesday
when rebel forces within the Panamanian Defense Forces tried
unsuccessfully to depose Gen. Noriega.
   Meanwhile, Pentagon officials said the routine military
exercises have been conducted all week on thoroughfares in Panama.
``We're exercising our troops,'' said one official, asking to
remain anonymous. The exercises include convoys and troop workouts.
   As required, U.S. officials always notify the Panamanian Defense
Forces about the movements, the official said.
   Reconstructing events of Tuesday, U.S. officials confirmed that
the U.S. Southern Command had moved ``forces in a position to
secure'' a causeway and a bridge on the Pan American Highway, which
leads to the area where both the Panamanian Defense Forces and the
U.S. Southern Command are located.
   The command's headquarters at Quarry Heights is about one-half
mile from the main PDF barracks, the scene of gunfire and mortar
attacks during Tuesday's coup attempt.
   ``We did move forces in a position to secure the causeway and
the bridge of the Americas as a means of protecting U.S. citizens
who were on the base. Those are the major access routes to our
base,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The primary mission of the U.S. troops in Panama is the
protection of American citizens. The action also was taken to
protect the American-built Panama Canal, the main reason U.S.
troops remain in the country.
   Under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties, the United States is to
maintain the neutrality of the waterway, which is to be turned over
to Panama at the end of the century.
   Armed American troops took up positions, including in front of
the Defense Department-operated Balboa School, which was closed
Wednesday.
   Wood said U.S. troops had also blocked the road that leads to
Howard Air Force Base to the west of the command's headquarters.
   Under the terms of the canal treaties, the United States is to
turn over to the Panamanians on Dec. 31, 1999, all its military
sites along the 50-mile waterway.

   A jury recommended Wednesday that convicted
``Night Stalker'' Richard Ramirez die in the gas chamber, and the
devil-worshiping serial killer snarled: ``Big deal, death always
went with the territory, see you in Disneyland.''
   Ramirez, convicted of 13 savage murders, rocked in his chair and
peered around at courtroom spectators seated behind him as Superior
Court Judge Michael A. Tynan read aloud the jury's recommendations,
count by count.
   Jurors found Ramirez deserved the death penalty on 19 special
circumstances attached to felony convictions that included multiple
murders, burglary and sex crimes.
   State law requires a separate jury finding of special
circumstances before the death penalty can be imposed. As of Oct.
2, there were 265 inmates on death row in California.
   Tynan will consider the jury's recommendations before he
formally sentences Ramirez on Nov. 7. The facts of the case,
however, made it unlikely the judge would reduce the sentence to
life in prison without the possibility of parole, the only other
possible sentence.
   Under California law, the death sentence will be automatically
appealed.
   Ramirez made no comment in the courtroom but uttered his
``Disneyland'' remark to reporters while being taken back to jail.
He apparently was referring to his lawyer's contention to the jury
that life in prison was sufficient. ``He will never see Disneyland
again,'' lawyer Ray Clark had said.
   The judge thanked the jurors profusely for the year they had
spent on the case. ``I'm very proud of you,'' he told them. ``I
know you had a tough time of it. ... It was a very emotionally
charged case. I want to thank you for the public. God bless you.''
   ``I have nightmares all the time about the crimes,'' said juror
Cynthia Haden. ``I'll get over it, but I'll never be the same. I'll
never look at people the same.''
   ``How are you going to return to a normal life after going
through something like this?'' asked another juror, Bonita Smith.
   The jury's deliberations lasted five days in the death penalty
phase of the trial. The jurors did not look at Ramirez as the word
``death'' was pronounced 19 times by Tynan, but they answered in
firm voices, ``Yes, your honor,'' when the judge polled them
individually.
   Juror Alfredo Carrillo said there was little dissension among
jurors over whether to recommend the death penalty. The panel took
its time simply because there were so many counts.
   ``It took a lot of thinking,'' he said. He added about Ramirez,
``I think he's a pretty crazy man.''
   ``He got what he deserved,'' said Deputy District Attorney P.
Philip Halpin, who had urged the death penalty, describing Ramirez
to the jury as ``a miserable human being'' who killed for
self-gratification. Defense attorney Ray Clark had pleaded for
mercy.
   ``I think all human beings are deserving of our sympathy and
should not have their lives taken in the streets, in the courts or
in the gas chamber,'' said defense attorney Daniel Hernandez,
adding he does not think Ramirez wants to die.
   ``There's no punishment that could fit this crime,'' Judi
Arnold, daughter of Night Stalker victims Maxon and Lela Kneiding,
said tearfully after the verdicts. She said Ramirez should die.
   ``I have to live the rest of my life seeing my parents (as
murder victims) and what Mr. Ramirez did to them.''
   Jurors ruled Sept. 20 that the 29-year-old native of El Paso,
Texas, was the demonic killer who broke into homes through unlocked
windows and doors in the summer of 1985.
   As the pattern of satanic crimes unfolded, investigators found
men murdered in their beds, and women raped and beaten as the
assailant demanded money and jewels.
   Ramirez was convicted of 13 murders and 30 related felonies
ranging from rape and sodomy to burglary. In one murder, a victim's
eyes were gouged out. In another, a woman was raped beside the body
of her murdered husband.
   Satanic symbols were left at some murder scenes and some victims
were forced to ``swear to Satan'' by the killer, who held Southern
California in a grip of terror during his rampage. At a preliminary
hearing Ramirez held up a hand inscribed with a pentagram, a symbol
of devil worship, and said, ``Hail Satan.''
   For jurors, the penalty recommendation ended more than a year of
jury service during which they endured the murder of one of their
own panel members, likely to become a point of appeal.
   Juror Phyllis Singletary was found slain at her home Aug. 15 in
the midst of jury deliberations on Ramirez's guilt or innocence.
Her live-in boyfriend committed suicide a day later and left a note
admitting he had killed her.
   Ramirez, sullen through most of the trial, usually hid his eyes
behind dark glasses. At the end of the guilt phase he refused to be
present in court and was allowed to listen through a speaker in a
nearby cell.
   Confronting photographers after his conviction, he flashed a
two-fingered ``devil sign'' and muttered the word: ``Evil.''

   The Coast Guard seized a ship carrying 11,500
pounds of cocaine _ the largest maritime cocaine seizure in
history, Coast Guard officials said Wednesday.
   The Zedom Sea, a 185-foot offshore supply vessel reportedly
headed from Colombia but flying the Panamanian flag, is being
escorted to New Orleans, said Rear Adm. William F. Merlin. Nine
people aboard were arrested and will be turned over to the Drug
Enforcement Administration, he said.
   ``We are not sure we have found all the cocaine,'' Merlin said
at a news conference at regional Coast Guard headquarters here.
``We are turning it over to Customs.''
   The vessel was seized Monday when the crew of the cutter Cushing
boarded it in the Gulf of Mexico, off the Yucatan Peninsula, Merlin
said. It was expected to dock early Thursday.
   The cocaine was hidden on the deck in huge shipping containers
the size of railroad box cars, Merlin said. It was mixed among a
cargo of portland cement and in fake walls of the containers, he
said.
   Merlin said the Coast Guard has been patrolling the western Gulf
on the lookout for possible smugglers and found the ship headed due
west about 60 miles northwest of Progreso, a port on the Yucatan.
   ``All ships in the Yucatan Channel are suspect to us at this
time,'' Merlin said.
   He said the boarding crew became suspicious because the vessel
was listed as hauling cement and gelatin, described as an unusual
cargo. In addition, he said, the ship's registry gave its
destination as Vera Cruz but the captain said it was going to
Tampico.
   The ship was reportedly coming from Baranquilla, Colombia, said
Lt. Pat Philbin.
   In Washington, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson called it the
``largest maritime cocaine seizure in history'' and added, ``This
gives us a pretty good run.''
   Last weekend, he said, the Coast Guard seized 2,000 to 2,500
pounds of cocaine in a ship near Puerto Rico and, on Monday, seized
about 1,000 pounds of the drug from an air drop near that island.
   ``In this fiscal year,'' which began Sunday, ``we've gotten
about as much as we got all last year,'' he said.
   In fiscal 1989, the Coast Guard seized a total of about 12,000
pounds of cocaine, he said.
   ``We had a real lull after things in Colombia went crazy,''
Simpson said, referring to the Colombian government's crackdown on
drug traffickers that began Aug. 18 after the assassination of a
leading presidential candidate.
   ``For a long time, we didn't see anything,'' he said, until
Sept. 10, when the Coast Guard seized about 1,200 pounds of cocaine
offshore from Miami. ``After a long lull, things are moving again.''
   The latest seizure follows by less than a week the largest
cocaine seizure in history _ about 20 tons found in a warehouse in
Los Angeles. The only seizure close to that was nearly 12 tons in
Colombia.
   The largest previous maritime seizure of cocaine occurred in
November 1987 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where officials found more
than 8,700 pounds of cocaine in hollowed-out lumber that had been
cut for patio furniture.

   Officers trying to depose Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega held him hostage for up to five hours, but let him
go after loyal forces told his captors they would ``face the
consequences'' if any harm came to the general, a Noriega aide said
Wednesday.
   Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, director for the Panamanian Defense
Forces Security and Defense Committee, told journalists that during
the coup attempt on Tuesday, Noriega ``had tried to calm his
captors during the time he was held, trying to avoid a bloodshed.''
   Lower-ranking officers attempting the coup were defeated after
loyal forces surrounded Defense Forces headquarters and
counterattacked.
   ``The surrender came when the loyal officers took command of the
combat units and gave the rebels a last chance to release the
commander and members of his staff or face the consequences,''
Castrejon said. ``The general was a hostage for four hours.''
   Later Castrejon said Noriega was held for five hours. It was not
clear if Noriega was released before or after the final violent
assault on the headquarters that led to the rebel forces' surrender.
   ``He was confident that elite forces and the special forces and
rest of the officers and soldiers of the Defense Forces were going
to solve the problem immediately, as it happened,'' Castrejon added.
   Castrejon spoke briefly to reporters in front of Defense Forces
headquarters Wednesday and did not say who coordinated the rescue
and counterattack operation.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in
Washington, said they were mystified by the decision to let Noriega
go.
   ``Noriega was in their clutches,'' said one U.S. official
Wednesday.
   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since February
1988, when he was indicted on drug trafficking and money laundering
charges in Florida.
   If things had gone right for the rebels, ``Noriega would have
been at night court in Miami listening to a judge telling him he
was being detained without bail,'' one U.S. official said wistfully.
   However, U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said U.S.
officials didn't know how long Noriega had been held and told
reporters, ``Clearly they (his captors) were not of a mind to turn
him over to us.''
   In Panama City, neighbors said they saw Noriega enter Defense
Forces headquarters with members of his staff Tuesday morning, and
that the shooting began about 10 minutes later. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   During the fighting Castrejon made a television announcement
saying Noriega was in an undisclosed location and was in radio
contact with his troops.
   Later, Maj. Edgardo Lopez, a Defense Forces spokesman, said
Noriega had personally taken the rebels' surrender, meaning he was
on the spot when the fighting ended.
   The headquarters building is a four-story structure that
occupies an entire city block. The Urraca company, whose soldiers
were involved in the coup attempt, is located in barracks across a
small patio in the same Defense Forces compound that extends for
several hundred yards along Panama Bay.
   Jose Blandon, a Panamanian defector once close to Noriega, said
in Washington he had been told by a coup leader over the telephone
during the uprising that the general had been wounded, but when
Noriega appeared before television cameras later there was no sign
of an injury.
   Asked why the rebels would decide to free Noriega, one U.S.
official said, ``It's crazy. I don't understand it.''
   The U.S. officials said they are concerned that the rebels face
a bleak future in detention. The sources said some of the
insurgents involved in the March 1988 uprising are still being
tortured.
   U.S. officials have refused to comment on reports that some of
the rebels took refuge at U.S. Southern Command headquarters in
Quarry Heights, a few hundred yards from the fighting.
   Asked if anything positive occurred during Tuesday's events, the
officials said Noriega had tried hard through purges to ensure the
loyalty of the Defense Forces but was still unable to head off an
uprising.
   Tuesday's coup attempt also was much closer to succeeding than
the 1988 insurrection, the officials said, adding that Noriega's
own behavior Tuesday evening indicated how close he had come to
being deposed.
   Noriega was ebullient after riding out the earlier coup and was
far more subdued this time, they said.
   By Wednesday, however, Noriega leaned out a window to wave to a
cheering crowd of supporters outside his bullet-pocked headquarters.

   The third act of ``The Godfather'' films
begins next month in Italy with Francis Ford Coppola directing Al
Pacino as the powerful underworld don Michael Corleone.
   Paramount's ``The Godfather _ The Continuing Story'' starts
filming in Rome on Nov. 15 from a script written by Coppola and
Mario Puzo, who first chronicled the Corleone saga in the
best-selling novel ``The Godfather.''
   In addition to Pacino, nominated twice for Academy Awards in the
previous two films, Diane Keaton will return as the ex-wife of
Pacino's Corleone and Talia Shire, Coppola's sister, reprises her
role as sister Connie Corleone.
   New faces in the trilogy will be Andy Garcia, who portrays an
illegitimate Corleone son, and Eli Wallach as a friend of the late
Don Corleone.
   ``We hope to do something in the tradition of the others,''
Coppola told Daily Variety in Wednesday's editions. ``If all three
were put together, we would like to feel they're all part of one
`Godfather' project.
   ``This is very much a third act.''
   The original ``Godfather'' movie was released in 1972; the
sequel two years later garnered 16 Oscar nominations. Each won the
coveted best picture Academy Award.
   The two ``Godfather'' movies have grossed more than $700 million
worldwide.

   The District of Columbia Court of Appeals
refused Wednesday to block the extradition of a juvenile facing a
possible death sentence in Alabama in connection with a 1988
firebombing that killed a 14-month-old boy.
   A three-judge panel of the court ruled that the district must
honor an interstate agreement governing the extradition of
juveniles, despite the district's own ban against capital
punishment.
   ``If our city, through its courts, does not respect its
obligations to other jurisdictions, then they will not respect
theirs to us,'' Associate Judge Frank E. Schwelb wrote in a
concurring opinion.``Under the compact, the district's word is its
bond.''
   The youth, identified only by the initials O.M., has been held
by district authorities since last December, when he was arrested
in connection with a warrant issued by Gadsden, Ala., authorities,
charging him with arson and murder in the death of Tamel Jackson.
   The infant was killed when a firebomb was hurled into a Gadsden
apartment. Alabama authorities also have charged two uncles of O.M.
with arson and murder in the case. One of the uncles, another
juvenile identified by the initials S.T., was arrested by district
authorities in August and is fighting extradition.
   The appeals court ruling dissolves an order that had been
blocking O.M.'s extradition. One of the boy's lawyers, James Klein
of the district's public defender's office, declined to comment on
whether new legal challenges will be filed.
   Detective Lt. Jeff Wright of the Gadsden Police Department said
he will make travel plans to pick up O.M. and return him to Alabama
as soon as the department is notified officially of the ruling.
   The case has attracted widespread attention because of
contentions by O.M.'s lawyers that he cannot get a fair trial from
the predominantly white judicial system in Etowah County, Ala.,
where both his father and another relative died while in police
custody.

   Actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith are

   The baby girl, named Dakota, was born Wednesday in Austin,
Texas, where Johnson is filming the Dennis Hopper-directed movie
``Hot Spot,'' said publicist Elliott Mintz.
   ``Mother and baby are fine,'' said Mintz.
   Johnson, star of the popular long-running series ``Miami Vice''
married Miss Griffith for the second time last June, was present

   Johnson 39, and Miss Griffith, 31, previously were married in

Tune</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The former chairman of the high school music
department has sued claiming he was demoted because the band played
Willie Nelson's romantic ballad ``Always On My Mind'' in a town
Memorial Day parade.
   Robert J. Harris was teaching Wednesday and could not be
immediately reached for comment. He contended in his Superior Court
lawsuit that his demotion ``constitutes unlawful intimidation,
coersion and harassment.''
   Harris is suing for back pay and restoration as chairman.
   Brian Riley, an attorney for the Massachusetts Teachers
Association, which is representing Harris, said the dispute stemmed
from Harris' choice of the ballad for the 1988 Memorial Day parade.
   ``He was criticized at the time by school officials as the tune
was felt not to be appropriate military marching music,'' Riley
said. ``We felt it was appropriate music and this reprisal violated
his rights to academic freedom.''
   Superintendent of Schools James P. Kelley, whose memos
criticized the selection ``an embarrassment,'' did not return
telephone calls to his office. School attorney Spencer Tobin said
Harris' demotion had nothing to do with musical selection.
   ``We are all Willie Nelson fans here,'' Tobin said from his
Boston office. He said the school committee voted in August 1988 to
eliminate Harris' stipend as department chairman, effective June
30, 1989, in an attempt to cut costs.

   Panama's provisional president on
Wednesday blamed the aborted coup against Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega on a small group of disgruntled soldiers backed by the
United States.
   In remarks to reporters, Provisional President Francisco
Rodriguez asserted Tuesday's attempted coup ``was fostered and
supported by the government of the United States'' but that it
``found no resonance of any kind within the ranks of the defense
forces or citizens.''
   He asserted there was no widespread dissatisfaction in the
Panamanian military. Noriega, the Defense Forces chief, uses his
official position to maintain de facto control of the government.
   In Tuesday's coup attempt, rebel forces attacked and seized the
Defense Forces headquarters in Panama City and claimed to have
ousted Noriega. But forces loyal to Noriega counterattacked and
took back the compound several hours later.
   The Panamanian military said about 65 rebel soldiers were
detained.
   In his comments, Rodriguez claimed videotapes show U.S. tanks
and ``U.S. contingents in combat readiness blocking roads in our
country in order to prevent contingents of the Defense Forces from
having access to the headquarters.'' He said film and photographs
would also be release as proof.
   President Bush has denied the United States engineered the
attempt to overthrow Noriega, but White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said U.S. officials had advance knowledge of it.
   U.S. officials said American forces moved into positions near
the fighting for security reasons.
   Rodriguez was asked why a superpower like the United States
would not be able to topple Noriega if it really wanted to support
a coup.
   ``It is clear that overt aggression backed by actual troops of
the U.S. Army would make everything too clear, and they really
wanted to cover up their ambitions in this area. But there is clear
evidence, photographs and so on, that there was support from the
U.S. Army stationed in our country,'' said Rodriguez.
   He said his provisional government will ``evaluate'' whether to
hold national elections some time after March but that Panama
cannot hold free and fair elections until the United States ends
its ``military and economic aggression.''
   The U.S. government has been trying to force out Noriega since
two federal grand juries in Florida indicted him on
drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges last year.
   U.S. efforts have included diplomatic pressure and trade and
economic sanctions against Panama.
   But the steps have not budged Noriega, whose government annulled
May 7 presidential elections. International observers said
opposition candidate Guillermo Endara won the presidency by a
landslide.
   Rodriguez, a longstanding associate of Noriega, was installed as
a provisional president after the election was nullified.

   Tens of thousands of Boeing Co. Machinists,
angered by what they called a stingy wage offer from the aerospace
giant, hit the picket lines Wednesday and said they would remain on
strike until they got a better offer.
   Pickets walked in 45-degree weather outside one of Boeing's
Seattle plants, waving signs as motorists and truck drivers honked
horns.
   ``The attitude's good,'' said Machinist Brian McTighe. ``People
are willing to picket, willing to do whatever it takes. The
attitude seems to be militant.''
   The Machinists union, which represents 43,000 Boeing workers in
the Puget Sound area, 12,000 at Boeing's Wichita, Kan., plant,
1,700 in Portland, Ore., and smaller numbers in a half-dozen other
locations, struck at 12:01 a.m. PDT when its contract expired.
   Federal mediator Douglas Hammond, who joined the talks over the
weekend, said he wanted negotiations to resume quickly between the
two sides because of the number of people affected and the
potential impact of a long strike at Boeing, Washington's largest
private employer.
   No talks were announced, although both sides indicated Tuesday
they were willing to resume negotiating.
   Members of other unions reported to work Wednesday, and Boeing
continued production work in the Seattle area with management and
non-union employees.
   Boeing spokesman Russ Young said the strike began peacefully
with no reports of friction at any of the company's plants.
   However, at the request of Boeing lawyers, a federal judge in
Wichita issued an injunction limiting the number of pickets at
Boeing gates and prohibiting pickets from speaking in an abusive or
intimidating manner to employees trying to report for work.
   The order was granted after pickets stopped each vehicle headed
toward the plant, attempting to persuade the occupants to honor
strike lines. Traffic was snarled, with delays of three hours or
more reported.
   Boeing's contract offer included an immediate raise of 4 percent
with 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, plus annual bonuses of
8 percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent the
next.
   Workers haven't had an increase in base wages _ which determine
pensions and other benefits _ for six years, although Boeing paid
bonuses of 12 percent in 1986 and 5 percent in 1987 and 1988.
   The proposal also would have reduced compulsory overtime from
200 hours a quarter to 160 hours and boosted some benefits and the
cost-of-living adjustment.
   For the average Machinist making $13.39 per hour, the offer
would have meant an additional $13,800 in income over the next
three years.
   The Machinists have declined to disclose their exact bargaining
position. However, members have indicated they were disappointed by
the proposed pay raise from Boeing, which is enjoying record
prosperity, and were upset the offer did not end mandatory overtime.
   ``Most people we talked to were basically insulted by the
contract,'' said picket Bryce Bushby.
   Worldwide, Boeing employs 144,725 people, including 106,000 in
western Washington. The company posted a profit of $614 million on
$16.96 billion in sales last year.
   The strike hits Boeing in its fifth consecutive year of record
jetliner orders as airlines update aging fleets. The wave of orders
has caused huge backlogs, pressuring Boeing to maintain delivery
schedules and forcing workers to put in heavy overtime.
   Although Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business for
Boeing's other divisions, Boeing Commercial Airplanes has a backlog
of nearly 1,600 jets worth about $70 billion and deliveries
extending well into the mid-1990s.
   The Machinists union represents the bulk of the company's
production workers, who perform tasks ranging from riveting, wiring
and plumbing in aircraft to quality inspections and machine-tool
maintenance.
   Young declined to say how the strike would affect Boeing's
aircraft deliveries and said there were no immediate plans to bring
in outside workers.

   Senate Democrats put the brakes on a bill to
ban flag desecration late Wednesday, saying a pair of
Republican-sponsored changes in the wording would leave it
vulnerable to a Supreme Court challenge.
   ``The one thing we are required to avoid doing, or giving the
court an excuse to suggest we are doing, is to proscribe any
communicative ideas ... any speech,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
said as the Senate postponed action.
   He said, however, that the court might well interpret the
proposed changes as an effort to limit freedom of speech.
   Sponsors had expected to pass the bill Wednesday afternoon but
instead ended up hoping to win approval on Thursday.
   The bill is a response to the uproar that followed a decision by
the Supreme Court that overturned a Texas flag-burning ban last
June.
   Lawmakers also acknowledged that the bill represents a move to
head off a proposed constitutional amendment against flag-burning,
set to come before the Senate in mid-October.
   A number of senators, mainly Democrats, say amending the
Constitution is not the proper way to deal with the issue, but many
other lawmakers say it is the only way to get around the court
decision.
   President Bush has called for a constitutional amendment against
flag burning, as have many congressional conservatives.
   At issue were only three words that Republicans sought to add to
the House-passed legislation.
   One amendment offered by Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., would
make it clear that flag desecration was banned only if it occurred
``publicly.''
   The other, sponsored by Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., would make
it illegal to ``physically defile'' the flag.
   The Supreme Court in the Texas case ruled in effect that
flag-burner Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted not for setting a
flag afire but because he was engaging in political protest. It
said that limited his freedom of speech and overturned the law on
that ground.
   Bill sponsors want the measure to avoid that problem by banning
any flag desecration, regardless of whether it involves political
protest.
   Debate over exactly what the Republican amendments would do
meandered into semantic thickets unusual even for the Senate floor.
   Biden said drily it was too bad former Sen. S.I. Hayakawa,
R-Calif., a noted authority on semantics as well as a politician,
was not still around to help out with the debate.
   The bill differs only slightly from an existing federal law
against flag burning.
   Current law bans any action that ``knowingly casts contempt upon
any flag of the United States by publicly mutilating, defacing,
defiling, burning or trampling upon it.'' It provides for penalties
of up to a $1,000 fine and a year in jail. The Texas law had a
similar wording.
   ``The statutory approach in my opinion is a futile and
ineffective gesture which will not pass the constitutional test at
all,'' Hatch said.
   Some critics said that there is no wide outbreak of flag burning
in the United States and that the bill would encroach on freedom of
speech as a means of fighting a danger that does not exist.
   ``It's not needed for the maintenance of democratic freedom,''
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. said.
   ``Of all things, today in the United States of America we need
to encourage our people to be less afraid, speaking what they
believe, letting their minds and hearts give rise to what they
truly think ought to be done,'' Kerrey told the Senate.
   Kennedy also said provisions of the measure designed to make
sure it would not be interpreted as an attack on dissent would be
difficult to deal with. For example, the measure would ban flag
desecration in private.
   ``It will criminalize a great deal of relatively trivial
behavior,'' he said. ``It will change the flag from a treasured
symbol to a government-regulated icon.''
   Lawmakers made it clear from the outset, however, that the bill
was popular enough to guarantee overwhelming approval.
   ``I am going to vote for this,'' Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C.
said. ``The people of my state are for it.''
   ``The flag represents the very heart of what it means to be an
American and it would be a tragedy for us to let its power be
undermined through legal desecration,'' Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.,
said.

   Anger mounted on Capitol Hill Wednesday among
both Democrats and Republicans at President Bush's handling of the
failed coup attempt in Panama, with one senior GOP lawmaker saying:
``We blew it.''
   But others, after being briefed by Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, said they agreed with the administration's caution in the
face of weak intelligence flowing in from Panama during the
uprising on Tuesday.
   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., likened the situation to the failed
attempt by exiled Cubans to invade at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, when
U.S. support was withheld at the crucial moment.
   ``Why have 12,000 troops in Panama who are highly motivated and
trained, and not use them in either a military or a paramilitary
manner?'' asked Skelton, a member of the House Armed Services
Committee.
   ``We had full knowledge they were going to do this. I'm afraid
it's a matter of cold feet,'' Skelton said in an interview. ``It
was a conscious decision (by Bush) not to assist ... I'm furious
about it.''
   On his way to the briefing, Cheney told reporters the
administration believes Noriega was in the control of the rebels
for a time, though it had not been clear during the uprising this
was the case.
   ``Clearly they were not of the mind to turn him over to us,''
Cheney said.
   Noriega is under federal indictment in Florida for drug
trafficking.
   Later, after the hour-long Cheney briefing, Skelton said the
administration's doubts weren't sufficient justification for
inaction. ``They wanted certainty. Well, you do not get an engraved
invitation to a coup... They just lacked boldness.''
   ``We look indecisive, vacillating and weak,'' said Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill. ``The consequences from this could be profound.''
   ``We blew it,'' said Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, the
senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   ``It's a major setback for our foreign policy. It raises
questions whether people down there can ever have confidence in the
United States.''
   Broomfield said if the White House had advance knowledge of the
coup plans and had called in senior congressional leaders, the
administration would have found ample support for a limited
military response to the uprising.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., who attended the closed briefing
conducted by Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, for members of the Senate, raised questions about
the United States' intelligence capability in Panama.
   ``It would appear to me that we would have better intelligence
sources in Panama than we have,'' Sasser told reporters. ``The fact
that this coup materialized, we don't have notice of it sooner than
we did, we could not have reacted quicker to it, I think it's some
indication that our intelligence sources in Panama are not as
adequate as we have a right to expect them to be given our long
presence in that country.''
   Asked after the Senate briefing what the coup attempt means for
Noriega, Cheney said: ``If I was in General Noriega's shoes, I'd be
a very nervous man tonight. Here's a guy whose got to have doubts
given the fact that one of his close supporters tried to run a coup
on him. That can't give him great confidence about his own
security.''
   There were some lawmakers supportive of Bush's decision, as well.
   ``The president was absolutely correct,'' said Rep. Joseph
McDade, R-Pa. ``We're not an invading force. We'd like to see
General Noriega out, but I support the president in what he did.''
   ``They deserve credit for the coolness and calmness they
displayed under very difficult circumstances,'' said Rep. Stephen
Solarz, D-N.Y.
   Opponents of Bush's inaction were far more vocal.
   Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said the
administration apparently has decided on a policy of not using
force in Panama.
   ``Any disturbance like this should have provided the necessary
cover and opportunity to move with military force against
Noriega,'' Aspin said. ``We ought to be ready at any opportunity
... They did not seize the moment.''
   ``This is laissez-faire diplomacy and it's outrageous,'' said
Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., a member of the House Intelligence
Committee. He said it would apparently have been relatively easy to
support the rebels, but the administration ``blinked.''
   ``Yesterday makes Jimmy Carter look like a man of resolve.
There's a resurgence of the wimp factor,'' McCurdy said.
   ``There is a role for force in our foreign policy. Bush would
have come off as a hero in America, and probably throughout Central
America. Now, instead, we have a major credibility problem.''
   Lack of U.S. support for the rebels makes it even more remote
that any members of the Panamanian military will risk another
uprising, he said. ``Who's going to volunteer to do this now?''

anti-Stalinist revolution that was crushed by Soviet tanks,
government spokesman Zsolt Bajnok said Wednesday.
   ``The government's intention is to have Oct. 23 declared a day

communist leadership declared in February that the uprising was a
legitimate popular uprising, not a fascist-inspired

<TEXT>
   Human rights activists and the leaders of
democratic forces in communist Eastern Europe were high on the list
of 90 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize, to be announced
Thursday.
   The Peace Prize is given by a five-member committee chosen by
the Norwegian parliament and the other Nobels are awarded by the
prize committee in Stockholm, Sweden.
   Candidates included Abbe Pierre, a French Roman Catholic priest
nominated for humanitarian work; Bruno Hussar, who set up an
Israeli-Palestinian peace village in Israel, Nelson Mandela, the
imprisoned black South African leader, and the International Scout
Movement, celebrating its 100th year.
   Sources who have been reliable in the past said the Dalai Lama,
exiled god-king of Tibetan Buddhists, had a chance of being chosen,
but the ferment in eastern Europe caused speculation that the prize
would go a democratic leader in the region.
   Often in recent years, the Peace Prize has been used to
encourage trends considered worthy and to build international
support for peace efforts.
   The 1987 award to President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica was
considered a major boost to his Central American peace plan, which
was adopted by the five presidents involved. Last year, the prize
went to the U.N. peacekeeping forces.
   Dagbladet, an Oslo newspaper, put two Czechoslovak dissidents,
writer Vaclav Havel and Jiri Hajek, foreign minister in the
reformist government of Alexander Dubcek at the time of the 1968
Soviet-led invasion, among the leading candidates for 1989. They
were signers of the Charter 77 human rights manifesto in communist
Czechoslovakia.
   Members of Sweden's parliament collectively nominated the Baltic
republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which were independent
when the Soviet Union absorbed them in 1940.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and former
President Ronald Reagan were early nominees for their 1987
agreement to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles. Nominations
close on Feb. 1 and the accord came too late for last year's prize.
   The first Peace Prize was awarded in 1901, but in 19 years none
was given. Nobel prizes this year are worth three million Swedish
kronor _ $469,000 at the current exchange rate.
   Prizes for peace, chemistry, literature, medicine and physics
were established by the estate of Alfred Nobel, who invented
dynamite and made a fortune. A sixth prize, in economics, was added
later and financed Sweden's central bank.
   Members of the Norwegian committee are Egil Aarvik, a retired
journalist and Cabinet minister; former Prime Minister Odvar
Nordli; history professor Francis Sejersted, the Rev. Gunnar J.
Staalsett, a Lutheran minister, and author Gidske Anderson.

   Moscow on Wednesday suggested turning its
``hot line'' with Washington into a worldwide party line.
   Saying hot line expansion would reduce the risk of war, the
Soviets proposed linking the line between the Soviet and U.S.
capitals also with Beijing, London, Paris, the U.N. headquarters
and nations belonging to the non-aligned movement.
   Vladimir Petrovsky, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, said
that idea and other ways of averting wars in the making were
submitted to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Wednesday.
   Petrovsky, who leads the Soviet U.N. delegation during the
General Assembly, said previously that Moscow hopes this year to
begin implementing practical aspects of its sweeping proposals to
improve world security.
   The Soviet Union has discussed its ideas with many nations, he
said, including the United States, where Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze broached the subject with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   He said the U.N. Secretariat ``could establish a military risk
reduction center as a link between the U.N. headquarters and the
Security Council members' capital cities and the chairman of the
non-aligned movement.''
   The 102-member non-aligned movement is made up of nations
without formal military alliances with East or West.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security forces arrested three
members of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's general staff and about 35
other soldiers after a failed coup, according to a ``war
communique'' read over national radio Wednesday.
   Panamanian officials also said rebelling troops held Noriega for
several hours during the attempted coup Tuesday but that the coup's
leader was killed during the fighting.
   The communique did not give any reason for the arrests of Col.
Guillermo Wong, the head of state security, and two other members
of the 20-member High Command, the Panamanian equivalent of a
general staff.
   If members of the High Command were implicated in the coup,
however, it would mean the plotting against Noriega extended much
higher than the lower-level officers involved in the rebellion.
   In those clashes, rebel soldiers captured the headquarters in
Panama City, but troops loyal to Noriega recaptured the compound
several hours later.
   Wednesday's government communique said 10 rebels were killed in
the fighting and 26 people were wounded. There were 18 wounded in
forces loyal to Defense Forces chief Noriega, three from the rebel
forces and five civilians, it said.
   The communique also said five coup leaders had taken refuge at
Fort Clayton, a U.S. base a few miles from Panama City. U.S.
officials have refused comment on that report.
   The other two arrested members of the High Command were Col.
Julio Ow Young and Col. Armando Palacios Gondola. Both had recently
served as Defense Forces representatives when the
Noriega-controlled government held talks with the civil opposition
in August.
   In addition, Palacios was a member of the combined staff of U.S.
and Panamanian officers that deals with Panama Canal security and
defense issues.
   Defense Forces spokesmen were not available for comment on the
arrests, according to people who answered phones at headquarters.
   The communique read by an announcer did nothing more than list
the names and ranks of those arrested, wounded or killed.
   Earlier, Maj. Edgardo Lopez, a Defense Forces spokesman, said at
least 60 soldiers and four of five officers had been arrested
shortly after the fighting.
   The arrest of Ow Young was puzzling because the officers who
mounted Tuesday's coup effort had named him as an officer to be
forcibly retired.
   One report said the lower-level officers who rebelled were
disgruntled over not being promoted. In their only communique, the
rebels said they were discarding the entire high command. That
communique was signed by a major and tw captains.
   The other 20 officers arrested ranged in rank from second
lieutenant to captain. About 15 sergeants, corporals and enlisted
men were also under arrest, the communique said.
   The communique also said 10 rebels, including nine officers,
died in the shooting Tuesday. It said the dead included Maj. Moises
Giroldi Vega, commander of the Urraca company, which was blamed for
the revolt. The unit is in charge of security at defense
headquarters.
   Around Panama City, government troops patrolled lightly traveled
streets Wednesday while U.S. helicopters watched from overhead.
   ``The gringo piranhas want to do away with me,'' the general
said during a brief tour of the street outside Panamanian Defense
Forces headquarters. Noriega has accused the United States of
supporting the attempted coup.
   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega for almost two
years, but the Bush administration denied any involved in Tuesday's
coup attempt.
   Later in the day, several thousand people, many of them public
employees, demonstrated in front of the building to show their
support for Noriega. The general leaned out a second-story window
and waved through iron bars.
   A Noriega aide said Wednesday that rebel officers trying to
depose Noriega captured him and held him for several hours Tuesday
but released him after loyal forces warned the rebels would ``face
the consequences'' if he was harmed.
   Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, director for the Defense Forces
Security and Defense Committee, told reporters that while being
held Tuesday, Noriega ``had tried to calm his captors ... trying to
avoid bloodshed.''
   ``The surrender came when the loyal officers took command of the
combat units and gave the rebels a last chance to release the
commander and members of his staff or face the consequences,''
Castrejon said. ``The general was a hostage for four hours.''
   Later, however, Castrejon said Noriega was held five hours. It
was not clear if Noriega was held when the final assault was made
by loyal troops.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in
Washington, said earlier Wednesday they were mystified by the
decision to let Noriega go.
   The United States has been imposed economic sanctions and tried
other measures to oust Noriega after he was indicted on U.S. drug
trafficking and money laundering charges in Florida in February
1988. Noriega denies the charges.
   In Panama City, neighbors said they saw Noriega enter Defense
Forces headquarters with members of his staff Tuesday morning, and
that the shooting began about 10 minutes later. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   During the fighting, Castrejon made a TV announcement saying
Noriega was in an undisclosed location and was in radio contact
with his troops.
   Later, Lopez, the Defense Forces spokesman, said Noriega had
personally taken the rebels' surrender, meaning he was on the spot
when the fighting ended.
   Many Panamanians chose to stay home Wednesday and U.S. bases
were shut under condition Delta, which restricts movement of
personnel. About 12,000 American soldiers are stationed in Panama.
   The uprising ``aggravated the Panamanian crisis in every
dimension and makes it more dangerous,'' opposition leader Ricardo
Arias Calderon told a news conference. He said the military regime
``is divided against itself and rejected by the great majority of
the people.''
   Civilian foes of Noriega denied involvement.
   U.S. sanctions have damaged the economy, but Noriega remains. He
annulled the opposition's election victory May 7 and has put down
two coup attempts.
   After the battle Tuesday, Noriega replaced the 350-member Urraca
company, with the Machos de Monte, or Wild Boars, a unit that
joined the counterattack.
   At the United Nations in New York, President Francisco Rodriguez
told a news conference the coup was attempted by a small group of
soldiers ``fostered and supported by the government of the United
States ... that found no resonance of any kind within the ranks of
the Defense Forces or citizens.''

   Police said Wybran, 49, was shot once in the head from close
range at about 6 p.m. Tuesday as he approached his car outside
Brussels University Hospital, where he headed the immunology
department. He underwent emergency surgery but died early Wednesday.
   No one claimed responsibility.
   Wybran, head of a coalition of Jewish groups, was a moderate in
the Israeli-Arab conflict. He campaigned for removal of a Roman
Catholic convent from the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp
in Poland.
   Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet told a radio station
Wednesday, ``This cold-blooded murder committed with such
efficiency points to a terrorist act, probably linked to the role
Dr. Wybran played at the head of the Jewish community _ even worse,
because of his moderation.''
   There were no witnesses. Police made a nationwide appeal for
information.
   Police were investigating whether the killing was anti-Semitic
or political.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel said Wybran would ``go
down in history as an example of a Jew who fought for the sake of
his people.''
   A statement from the Israeli Embassy said Wybran had no personal
enemies, and ``it is therefore evident'' that he ``was assassinated
in cold blood because he was a Jew.''
   Michel Peytier, a spokesman for the Brussels prosecutor's
office, said, ``Given the nature of his activities, it cannot be
excluded that this was a political attack.''
   He added that ``at first sight it is very unlikely, not to say
beyond probability'' that Wybran was killed for private reasons.
   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens issued a statement expressing
``indignation at violence and intolerance.''
   Wybran headed the Coordinating Committee of Jewish Organizations
in Belgium, which represents about 30,000 Jews in this
overwhelmingly Catholic country of 9.9 million.
   He also served as chairman of the Belgian chapter of the
Auschwitz Committee, which has pressed for removal of an order of
Carmelite nuns from the site of the former Nazi death camp.
   On a recent visit to Poland, Wybran urged authorities to
publicly oppose anti-Semitism and other forms of racism.
   Jewish leaders say the convent and its religious symbols are
offensive at place where 2.5 million Jews were killed.
   The church has said it will move the convent to an interfaith
center to be built nearby.
   Israeli Ambassador Avi Primor told Israeli army radio Wednesday
that neo-Nazis might have been behind Wybran's murder because of
his involvement in the Auschwitz matter.
   In 1980, one youngster was killed in a grenade attack in
Brussels on 50 Jewish teen-agers bound for summer camp. Three
people were killed the next year when an explosives-laden van blew
up outside an Antwerp synagogue and, in 1982, attackers sprayed a
Brussels synagogue with automatic weapons fire, wounding four
people.

<HEAD>New Wire Transfer Regulations in the Works</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department is planning
regulations aimed at money-laundering by international wire
transfer, a Treasury official said Wednesday night.
   Another initiative soon will require banks to report domestic
currency deposits of more than $10,000 on computer tapes, this
official said.
   The current reports of those large deposits are made on paper
forms. The banks ``file millions of those, year in and year out. It
creates an avalanche of paper'' that is extremely difficult to
handle by law enforcement agencies trying to track drug profits,
the official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was
summarizing testimony earlier in the day by Salvatore R. Martoche,
assistant secretary of the treasury for enforcement, before the
Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and
international operations.
   Just as they report large domestic deposits, banks report
transfers of large sums of cash to and from foreign banks. But
there is no requirement to report international wire transfers,
used increasingly by drug traffickers to move profits to safe
havens.
   ``It is very difficult to draft regulations in this area,'' the
official said. ``We will be looking very carefully at what can be
done.''
   The official declined to say what the substance of international
wire transfer regulations might be.
   ``We had meetings six weeks ago with foreign countries in Paris.
We do have some discussions under way and further discussions will
be held. As to what comes out of them, you will have to check back
in a few months,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Prosecution and defense attorneys rested
their cases Wednesday in the 3-year-old McMartin preschool
molestation trial, setting the stage for closing arguments to begin
next week.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders, who often expressed fear
that the case would end in a mistrial, scheduled lawyers'
summations to begin Oct. 12 and said he expects the matter to go to
the jury by Nov. 1.
   Pounders said he expects the balance of the case, including jury
deiberations, to take up to three months. ``I've got three months
to keep 12 jurors together and that makes me nervous,'' he added.
   The trial is the longest criminal proceeding in U.S. history.
Its cost of $15 million has made it the most expensive case ever
tried in Los Angeles.
   Raymond Buckey 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62,
are charged with 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of
conspiracy involving alleged molestations of 11 children at their
family owned school.
   ``This is almost as exciting as the day we started jury
selection,'' Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson said after both
sides had rested.
   Defense attorney Danny Davis said he believed the case could
have been tried in four months if the prosecution had trimmed the
number of charges and witnesses. He said that by now jurors
probably do not remember much of the voluminous evidence. But he
predicted a swift verdict acquitting the Buckeys.
   ``My prognosis is within two weeks after we submit it to the
jury we'll have a verdict. You can't come to the same room for two
years and not form an opinion on what you're going to do.''
   The case began in 1983 as the largest child molestation
prosecution ever. Seven teachers at the prestigious McMartin
Pre-School in Manhattan Beach were arrested and it was alleged that
hundreds of children had been molested during a five-year period.
   But after an 18-month preliminary hearing, charges were dropped
against five defendants by District Attorney Ira Reiner, who said
there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them.
   By then, the number of children allegedly involved had also
dropped.
   Since the trial began in April 1987 the jury of 12 with a backup
panel of six alternates has dwindled due to illness and employment
problems. The last alternate was used recently to replace an ailing
juror. A panel of 12 is required for a verdict in a criminal case.
   The prosecution's initial presentation of evidence took 14
months and the defense took 10 months. The prosecution also
presented about a month of rebuttal testimony.
   In April, the trial became the longest in California and U.S.
history, surpassing the two-year record of the Hillside Strangler
case.

   More than 100 Coast Guard personnel
were joined by park rangers Wednesday in the search for eight
people missing after a fishing boat struck a gas pipeline and
exploded in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Three people were killed and three others injured in the
accident, which happened just before dark Tuesday. The
20-square-mile search was hampered by the suspected presence of
hazardous chemicals.
   ``If they were presumed dead, we wouldn't be searching,'' Coast
Guard Lt. Scott LaRochelle said. ``The probability is high but
there is still a possibility (of survivors). There's always a
hope.''
   Two hazardous waste material experts boarded the boat later
Wednesday but found no missing crew members or dangerous chemicals,
officials said.
   The search was suspended later Wednesday but was expected to
continue Thrusday.
   Mike Benson, spokesman for the National Transportation Safety
Board in Washington, said the agency was sending a team to
investigate. The five-member team was expected to arrive in nearby
Port Arthur late Wednesday.
   A small fire continued to burn 18 hours after the 160-foot
``North Umberland'' apparently hit the 16-inch natural gas
pipeline, triggering a spectacular blaze that sent flames hundreds
of feet into the air, LaRochelle said.
   The main fire burned itself out Wednesday morning after the
pipeline was turned off.
   Officials speculated that nets being trawled by the boat snagged
the submerged pipeline and ruptured it, triggering the explosion.
   As divers stood by to inspect the ruptured pipeline and burned
boat, Coast Guard officials kept everyone 700 yards away from the
wreck. They were concerned about the possible presence of anhydrous
ammonia, a flammable coolant used on board fishing boats to
preserve the catch.
   The Coast Guard dive team of hazardous material experts was sent
from Mobile, Ala., with equipment to test the air and water in the
area.
   Texas Parks and Wildlife Department personnel, meanwhile,
inspected 5 miles of beaches because prevailing currents would send
survivors or victims toward the shore, the Coast Guard said.
   ``We're hoping to find some concrete evidence that will give us
some hope that some people are still alive,'' LaRochelle said.
   Two victims and three survivors were spotted by private
helicopters Tuesday night. A third was found just after noon
Wednesday.
   The three injured survivors remained hospitalized in nearby
Beaumont.
   Lori Kerr, a spokeswoman at Baptist Hospital, said names of the
victims were not being released immediately.
   She identified them as a 53-year-old man from Sulphur, La., with
burns over 68 percent of his body. His condition was listed as
critical.
   The other two, both in good condition, were identified as a
28-year-oid from Cameron, La., suffering burns to his face and
arms, and a 31-year-old from Lake Charles, La., suffering from
shock.
   The Cameron, La.-based ``pogy boat'' caught pogy or menhaden,
fish used for poultry feed and fertilizer, said Barney White,
spokesman for Houston-based Zapada Heynie Corp., which owns the
boat.

<HEAD>Soviet Union To Continue Suspension of Arms Shipments to Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will keep withholding
arms shipments to Nicaragua to encourage the United States to take
similar steps in Central America, officials announced Wednesday.
   The announcement was made in a Nicaraguan government statement
at the end of a 24-hour visit by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze. The Soviet official told reporters it amounted to a
joint statement.
   The communique said the suspension ``is a contribution Nicaragua
and the Soviet Union are making toward a total solution to the
conflict in the region and a decided support of the Central
American presidential agreements.''
   President Daniel Ortega and the presidents of four other Central
American countries signed an agreement Aug. 7 calling for
demobilizing the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels based in border
camps in Honduras.
   In exchange, the leftist Sandinista government agreed to make
democratic reforms, including allowing free campaigning by the
opposition for elections advanced to February 1990.
   The temporary halt to weapons shipments ``opens great
opportunities,'' Shevardnadze said. He said a total and permanent
suspension in weapons shipments would have to be ``reciprocated''
by the United States.
   However, he said the region also needs a way of setting limits
on combat forces in the Central American countries.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told President Bush in May
that the Soviet Union had suspended weapons shipments to Nicaragua
at the end of 1988.
   Soviet aid totaled $11.2 billion from 1980 to 1988, half of it
in military assistance. Though it says it has cut off supplies of
weapons, the Soviet Union has still sent Ortega's government $500
million in various forms of military aid this year.
   The United States has supported the Nicaraguan Contra rebels,
who have fought to overthrow the Sandinistas. However, it halted
weapons shipments to them in February 1988 while continuing such
aid as uniforms, food, vehicles and other supplies.
   However, the Sandinistas want the United States to cut off all
aid to the rebels.
   Washington also provides military and economic aid to the
Salvadoran government in its 10-year-old war against a leftist
insurgency.
   On the battlefront, Contra rebels attacked a military patrol in
western Nicaragua on Wednesday, killing six soldiers and wounding
six, the Defense Ministry said.
   In a news release, the ministry said the attack occurred near
the village of Puerto de Paris, 110 miles west of Managua. It gave
no details of the fighting.
   The government radio, the Voice of Nicaragua, called the attack
``cowardly and treacherous,'' noting that the government has called
a unilateral cease-fire in an effort to end the war.
   Also Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said two election
officials were kidnapped by Contras near the town of San Nicolas,
about 80 miles north of Managua. Its news release gave no details.

<TEXT>
   British comedian Graham Chapman, a
founding member of the ``Monty Python's Flying Circus'' TV series,
died Wednesday of cancer at Maidstone General Hospital, aged 48,
the hospital announced.
   Don Epstein, Chapman's manager, said in New York that Chapman
was rushed to the hospital from his home near Maidstone in
southeast England, 30 miles from London, on Tuesday. The hospital
announced the death in a statement early Thursday.
   The 6-foot-2, pipe-smoking star told reporters in August that he
had been diagnosed as having cancer of the tonsils which apparently
spread to his spine.
   Epstein said family members and friends, including other members
of the Monty Python team, were with Chapman when he died.
   Chapman was educated at Cambridge University and began his
career as a physician before the Monty Python group was created in
1969, bringing together the talents of Chapman, John Cleese, Eric
Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam.
   It was a fast-paced revue of sketches and blackouts pegged on
absurd themes with a distinctly British bent.
   The show premiered on British Broadcasting Corp. television on
Oct. 5, 1969, in a slot previously filled by a Sunday religious
discussion. The last original show in the weekly TV series was
broadcast in December 1974.
   The group's zany and often violent brand of comedy was an
international hit, including in the United States, and influenced
many other comics.
   Last February, Idle, Jones and Gilliam attended the opening in
New York of the Museum of Broadcasting's 20th Anniversary Salute to
Monty Python, a 10-day retrospective marking the comedians' first
appearance on British TV.
   Chapman played the leads in the troupe's first and second films:
King Arthur in ``Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' issued in 1979,
and Brian in ``Life of Brian,'' a parody on the life of Jesus
issued the same year that shocked many Christians.
   One critic wrote of ``Life of Brian'' at the time: ``This Monty
Python religious parable will probably offend every denomination
equally, but it shouldn't. The story of a man whose life parallels
Christ is the funniest and most sustained feature yet from
Britain's bad boys.''
   The group's last film, ``Monty Python's Meaning of Life,'' was
released in 1983.
   The group celebrated its 20th anniversary three weeks ago by
filming a television special to be released later this year.
   In an interview with the British newspaper The Sun two weeks
ago, Chapman said he believed he had beaten cancer. ``It's just a
matter of time before I'm fully well again,'' the paper quoted him
as saying then.
   He said earlier that his loss of weight to 168 pounds was due to
a healthy diet.
   The troupe had planned a big anniversary party at Prominent
Features, a movie production company in northwest London owned by
some of the Pythons, to start Wednesday night and continue into
Thursday. It was canceled Wednesday morning when it became apparent
Chapman was seriously ill, said Nancy Lewis, who represents the
Pythons in the United States.
   Since ``Monty Python's Meaning of Life,'' the members had gone
their separate ways.
   Chapman starred as a cranky old knight in an English comedy
television show called ``Jake's Journey.''
   Recently, Chapman had been writing for television and film in
the United States, Epstein said, and a comedy film Chapman produced
and wrote was about to go into preproduction.
   Chapman is survived by a son who lives in London, a brother and
nephews.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

   Gunmen thought to be leftist guerrillas
kidnapped prominent TV executive Hector Delgado Parker on Wednesday
after shooting up his armored-plated car, killing his driver and
badly wounding his bodyguard, police said.
   Police said pamphlets from the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement were found at the site. Witnesses said some
of those involved in the abduction were disguised as police
directing traffic.
   Delgado, the senior news executive of the major Channel 5
television station, served as an adviser to President Alan Garcia
before resigning two years ago in disagreement with Garcia's
efforts to nationalize Peru's banks. His family has controlling
interest in the station.
   Delgado may have been wounded in the shooting, witnesses said.
He was seized six blocks from Channel 5 in the middle-class suburb
of Lince.
   Witnesses told police another automobile cut off Delgado's car
at a street corner and that three men jumped from a second car that
was following the executive's vehicle and opened fire with
submachine guns.
   Delgado's car was hit at least 30 times, its windows shot out,
its tires punctured and deflated, police said.
   His driver was hit at least 12 times and died on the way to a
hospital. his bodyguard returned fire, but was struck by at least
seven bullets, police said.
   Witnesses said that up to eight kidnappers took part, including
three dressed as police who steered traffic away after Delgado's
car was intercepted.

   Hamburg officials ejected a group
of Gypsies occupying a former Nazi death camp site near this
northern port city, police spokesman Peter Michael Wenig said
Wednesday.
   Police moved in on Monday after city cultural officials, who own
and oversee the former Neuengamme concentration camp, filed a
trespassing complaint, Wenig told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview.
   He said police ordered 60 Gypsies occupying a building at the
camp to leave, adding, ``They decided to leave peaceably, we didn't
have to drag anyone or push anyone out. There was no force used.''
   The Gypsies have accused Hamburg police of using force to eject
them. Gypsy spokesman Yaron Matras told reporters in Hamburg on
Tuesday the police action ``makes a farce of claims that everyone
can live freely in West Germany.''
   The Gypsies and set up house trailers and built campfires there
Sunday to protest rejection of some of their applications for
asylum in West Germany.
   They demand that all be allowed to stay in West Germany and none
be forced to return to their Yugoslav homeland. A decision on
possible deportation is pending.
   The Gypsies now are staying at a Protestant church community
center.
   About 500,000 Gypsies were exterminated during the the Nazi era.

   The 10-10 vote was split nearly along party lines, but both
sides agreed the battle will be fought again on the Senate floor,
perhaps later this week.
   The vote came on an amendment by Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., to
substitute a capital gains cut for the expanded IRAs that Chairman

   The Supreme Court has upheld President
Virgilio Barco's decree allowing extradition of accused drug bosses
to the United States but overturned his order to seize their
ranches, mansions and other property.
   The decisions Tuesday preserve Barco's main weapon in his
government's unprecedented crackdown on cocaine traffickers, who
have used murder, bribery and intimidation to thwart Colombian
efforts to bring them to justice.
   However, the decision on confiscation of property eliminates the
military's power to raid such property at will.
   The 24-member court's ruling means the government may have to
return more than 1,000 confiscated homes, ranches, mansions, office
buildings and other property said to belong to cocaine kingpins.

   The drug crackdown and a U.S. Supreme Court
decision allowing prosecutors to seize money and property earmarked
for attorneys' fees may chase some of the nation's top defense
lawyers out of criminal law.
   Racketeering laws, they complain, give the government so much
power to confiscate assets that the Sixth Amendment right to choose
one's own attorney may effectively vanish because suspects are left
penniless before trial.
   In June, the high court approved that power, ruling 5-4 that
prosecutors may even seize assets set aside to pay an attorney.
   The power applies to all racketeering suspects, not just accused
drug traffickers, said Neal Sonnett, president of the 15,000-member
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

   Workers in plants in at least seven states _ including Boeing's

to go through the good times with them as well as the hard times.''
   More than 57,000 Machinists, including 43,300 in the Seattle

contract offer and reaffirm the strike deadline. The union
represents the bulk of the company's production workers.

   His work doesn't appear in glossy
architectural magazines and he draws no raves reviews for his
timber frames, collar beams and squat designs in bare concrete.
   But the American John Beynon wins praise in Asia for designing
schools that can stand up to cyclones, floods and earthquakes.
   ``No regrets,'' said the 53-year-old ``disaster architect'' when
asked if he ever thinks about skyscrapers and glamorous homes he
might have created.
   ``Here, we're dealing with very real, urgent problems and these
you find in the poorest and remotest areas. There's more work than
one can handle in a lifetime.''
   Over the last few years a greater and more organized effort has
been made in Asia on minimizing the blows of natural forces. Part
of the impetus has come from massive disasters as the 1985 cyclone
that killed 10,000 people in Bangladesh and last year's earthquake
in Armenia, where 25,000 people died.
   ``As someone pointed out after the Armenian earthquake,
`Earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do,''' Beynon said.
``There are very few natural disasters which should inevitably
destroy a building.''
   The U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), where Beynon serves as principal architect, is focusing
on disaster-proofing school buildings in nearly 20 Asian nations
including Bangladesh, India, the Philippines and Vietnam.
   ``When there is a cyclone, go to the school,'' UNESCO advises
Asians in villages where the school building is a safe structure
and homes tend to be flimsy. If it survives a natural disaster, the
school _ often the largest building of the community _ serves as
the obvious center for shelter and relief.
   Conversely, rural children may suffer disproportionately high
casualties in classrooms when natural disasters strike because the
most densely populated area in an Asian village is likely to be the
school, and it's often not safe enough.
   ``We don't like to talk to officials in the capitals,'' Beynon
said. ``We go to the end of the line.''
   In Nepal this meant trekking for days to remote Himalayan
hamlets where he learned that while iron and concrete may make for
the best earthquake-proofing these are hardly the materials to be
carried in on the backs of porters. Material available in the area
has to be used.
   ``My first approach is to listen and learn from the people,''
Beynon said. ``During the first week you forget everything you know
and look at the problem through their eyes and skills and then you
try to improve on this. The greatest disaster is the instant
expert.''
   Beynon tries to persuade planners that for only a little added
to a school's total cost _ 3 percent to 15 percent in the case of
cyclone protection _ they can save lives as well as money in the
long term.
   He tries to get local ``barefoot architects'' to provide ideas
and skills. UNESCO gives assistance and training in the concepts of
disaster architecture.
   To resist cyclones, a general term for typhoons, hurricanes and
tropical storms, structures must be designed from the top down. The
great wind force of a cyclone tends to lift buildings upwards so a
system of special attachments running from roof to foundation must
be incorporated to figuratively chain them down.
   To minimize earthquake damage, schools are designed to move
with, rather than against, the various motions unleashed by seismic
disturbances. Structures must be flexible yet also held together by
encompassing ``bands'' of iron, wood or other materials.
   Schools in flood-prone regions are best set above the ground.
They should include a waterproof room where equipment can quickly
be secured as well as cooking and toilet facilities for those who
take shelter. Since the school could serve as a final refuge and a
platform for relief supplies from the sky, the roof must be built
flat and strong.
   Beynon accumulated his skills at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where he studied architecture, and while working for an
American foundation sponsoring innovative work in educational
design.
   He joined UNESCO in 1964 in Paris, moving in 1980 to its Asian
headquarters in Bangkok where his team includes another architect,
a civil engineer and a furniture designer.
   Beynon was called to the island of Tonga in the Pacific in 1982
after more than 10 percent of its schools were razed by Tropical
Cyclone Isaac. Since cyclones strike Tonga in 20-year cycles, there
had been little sense of urgency.
   With Beynon's help cyclone-proof schools were designed and put
up. Prefabricated construction was used for schools on outer
islands that lacked skilled craftsmen.
   ``We'll have to wait another 15 years to see how good our work
was,'' he said, referring to the 20-year cycles.

<HEAD>Despite Oil, Saudis Look to More Abundant Sunshine for Power</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Saudis have oil reserves that
will easily last 100 more years, but they're looking for a more
abundant resource for their energy _ sunshine.
   The sun, which raises temperatures to 120 degrees in summer,
disappears behind clouds only a few days a year and that's mainly
in some of the higher plateau regions.
   A $26 million ``solar village'' with 160 photovoltaic solar
generators each containing 251 solar cells is operating in the
desert 32 miles northwest of Riyadh, the capital.
   Built in 1982 as part of a $100 million Saudi-U.S. solar
research cooperation agreement called Soleras, it is the largest
facility of its kind in the world and one of 10 in existence.
   U.S. involvement in the project ended two years ago, but Saudi
solar research continues.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is hardly
desperate for an alternative energy source, but it is trying to
lessen its economic dependence on oil.
   Solar energy is still prohibitively expensive and relatively
inefficient.
   Current technology can convert only about 12 percent of the
sun's energy to electricity. Storage of the energy in solar
batteries, which last five to seven years, adds about 30 percent to
the production costs.
   But officials at King Abdul-Aziz Center for Science and
Technology, a quasi-governmental organization that spearheads solar
research, are not discouraged.
   ``We knew it would be expensive at first,'' said Fahad Huraib,
the center's solar research program director.
   ``But most of the money went into research. It helped in
promoting this type of technology. To develop an energy source
takes from 50 to 100 years.''
   The solar village contains a sophisticated solar laboratory,
where environmental effects on the efficiency of solar energy can
be simulated and measured.
   The village's original purpose was to use a concentrated
photovoltaic system to convert the sun's rays into 350 kilowatts of
direct current electricity a day.
   The beneficiaries are the 4,000 residents of three nearby
villages. They received solar-generated electricity for five years,
their first source of reliable power.
   The villages are now hooked into Riyadh's main power grid, which
is also suppled by the solar village.
   Saudi authorities hope that, in time, solar energy will be used
to bring electricity to all isolated villages.
   Huraib said that could encourage people to stay in their
villages and help curb mass migration to the cities.
   In other parts of Saudi Arabia, solar projects are already
running. They include a water desalinization plant in the Red Sea
industrial city of Yanbu.
   ``It produces 200 cubic meters (52,600 gallons) of water a day
from indirect freezing techniques using solar energy,'' Huraib said.
   Concentrated heat from the sun produces steam that powers the
refrigeration equipment for the system. As seawater is chilled,
fresh water crystallizes and forms ice which is then washed and
melted.
   In southern Saudi Arabia, highway tunnels through mountains are
illuminated by on-site photovoltaic collectors.
   Huraib said the Ministry of Transportation and Communications is
studying the possibility of lighting all remote tunnels in this
manner.
   The kingdom's giant oil company, Saudi Aramco, is using solar
energy to provide cathodic protection for some of its pipelines in
the eastern province.
   At the King Abdul-Aziz Center in Riyadh, solar thermal water
heaters service all staff housing.
   Yassen al-Saedi, site manager at the solar village, said that
next year the center will begin experimenting with solar-generated
irrigation on a half-acre vegetable plot.
   But the most ambitious of the center's plans is a Saudi-West
German research and development project to produce hydrogen through
solar energy.
   ``Hysolar will be the largest project of its kind in the
world,'' al-Saedi said.
   Financed by the center and several West German government
organizations, the project will use the solar village's
photovoltaic solar generators to produce hydrogen by splitting
water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.
   ``It's the fuel of the future,'' Al-Saedi said.
   Three major Saudi universities are also participating in the
research.
   The plan is to experiment with several possible consumer
applications, such as running internal combustion engines and as a
fuel cell to produce electricity.
   Huraib does not rule out the possibility of exporting hydrogen.
   ``It could be transported through the pipeline as a natural
gas,'' he said.

<HEAD>Flash Cadillac Still Majors in Fun</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLEN MILLER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The members of Flash Cadillac have
worked hard for their Ph.Ds in fun.
   ``We've been going to every college in the West for 20 years but
never go to class,'' said Kris Moe, the keyboard player.
   They abandoned the traditional quest for national rock stardom
after six miserable years in Los Angeles, even after hitting gold
and platinum with the soundtrack to ``American Graffiti,'' because
Los Angeles just isn't their kind of town.
   ``When we left Boulder for L.A., I called my mom,'' said Warren
Knight, the bass guitar player. ``She said, `Do what you want to
do, but don't go out there and become one of those people.' We
didn't.''
   Knight's mom, by the way, has been known to occupy her time
protesting nuclear weapons and calling her kids for bail money.
   So Flash Cadillac left California in the mid-'70s and moved back
to Colorado. While they're not getting rich, they're getting by,
and just about anybody who attended a college in the Rocky
Mountains during the past 20 years knows who they are.
   So does the National Association of Broadcasters, where Flash
recently did a gig, and the Beach Boys, who've tried to take back a
crowd after Flash warmed up. And so does American Bandstand.
   But getting back to Colorado was the band's goal. They, like
many other residents of the mountains, figured the tradeoff of less
money for a better life was an easy call.
   ``It's great to spend all day in the recording studio and walk
out into paradise instead of on a street corner in L.A.,'' Moe said.
   Their headquarters is a ranch above Woodland Park, about 30
miles west of Colorado Springs in clear view of Pike's Peak. They
call it Freedonia, The Ranch, a name taken from the Marx brothers'
movie ``Duck Soup.''
   The place has a main house, extensively remodeled, a trout pond,
state-of-the-art recording studio and other homes as well. Moe and
Linn Phillips live there, while the other four members live in
Colorado Springs to be closer to offspring.
   There's a duck or two in the pond and a neighbor grazes some
cows on the property. Flash Cadillac used to own livestock _ a cow
by the name of Pot Roast _ but ducks and pet fish are easier.
   The band plays rock 'n' roll _ anybody's rock 'n roll _ and has
a reputation for being about the best party band around. Even
Rolling Stone magazine once gave them that honor.
   They do have fun. They talk of how they really don't remember
what their first official appearance was in 1969 in Boulder,
because their rehersals were so much fun they can't distinguish
between those and their stage acts.
   They made headlines in Boulder almost right off the bat when
they were banned from that hard-partying college town in 1971. The
ban came at a time when the University of Colorado was ranked as
the nation's top party college by Playboy magazine.
   ``It wasn't that we were really gross or out of line, but they
decided we didn't put in enough effort to keep things under
control,'' Moe said.
   The band had been playing bar gigs in Boulder. Tulagi's, a
saloon of some note in those years, initially booked Flash Cadillac
for a ``drown night,'' allowing students to drink unlimited amounts
of beer for $1.75.
   A few weeks later, Tulagi's compounded the problem by holding a
``drown night'' the same time as ``gross night,'' and things got
out of hand.
   Police had to be summoned. CU grads say there was beer an inch
deep in the place. The prizes for the ``no skin, no win'' dance
project were, in a word, gross.
   Flash has cleaned up its act since then, but not the fun
quotient.
   ``That's why we left L.A.,'' Moe said. ``All anybody does out
there is spend all day yelling and screaming and arguing. So you
waste all your time and they end up calling the shots. They take
all of the credit and most of the money.
   ``If you really want to play music, you have to get away and do
it. We were all going nuts in L.A.''
   Flash Cadillac hasn't given up trying for national success. The
band is working on a couple of recordings, one aimed at what they
believe is a budding country-rock blend suited to their style.
   ``If we operate at a reasonable regional level, we can stay in
business and play music,'' Moe said. ``We're living where we want
to live. Go national? Sure, but not at the expense of living in
L.A. or traveling around the country as an itinerant jukebox.''

<HEAD>Mission Officials Address Attitudes Toward Native Cultures</HEAD>

   ``Take up the white man's burden
   Send forth the best ye breed,
   Go, bind your sons to exile
   To serve your captives' need.
   _ Rudyard Kipling (1899)

   They no longer speak of their task as ``the
white man's burden,'' but some missionaries, perhaps influenced by
a decade of self-indulgence and national boosterism, are said to be
exporting self-righteousness with religion.
   The organizer of a conference on racism and ethnocentrism among
missionaries said mission officials have noticed some evangelists
are heading overseas with a diminishing respect for native cultures
and beliefs.
   ``The Reagan years, I don't know how else to say it, have
lessened the sensitivities and commitment to this,'' said Paul
Yount of the National Council of Churches. ``We'd thought we'd made
some headway into this, but now we're not so sure.''
   Daniel Romero, a mission director for the United Church of
Christ, recalled being shocked when a missionary couple referred to
Third World people as ``heathens.''
   ``To have that terminology used now, I think, is an insult to
the religious communities around the world,'' said Romero, general
secretary of the mission program of the Board of World Ministries
of the United Church of Christ.
   Mission officials discussed issues of racism and ethnocentrism
in missionary selection in a workshop earlier this week at Stony
Point, N.Y. The meeting was sponsored by the Overseas Personnel
Office of the Division of Overseas Ministries of the national
council.
   Member churches of the national council had some 4,300
missionaries overseas in 1985, slightly more than 10 percent of the
total 43,000 Protestant missionaries, according to Yount.
   Yount, director of overseas personnel for the council, noted
that many early missionaries took stands against colonial
authorities and that missionaries have translated the Bible into
almost every language and dialect.
   ``I would stress that the missionary heritage in this is both
positive and problematic,'' he said.
   The conference was called because many mission officials felt
the new generation of missionaries lacked sensitivity toward native
cultures, Yount said.
   ``The climate has changed,'' Yount said. ``There is not the more
widespread concern about the racism within our own culture,
classism within our own culture.''
   Romero, however, said he thought it was some older missionaries
who ``still carry some overtones of the past in which there is a
bit of that white superiority that comes creeping in.''
   He recalled, for example, how several such missionaries had
joked about the odd names they had encountered overseas, despite
being in the presence of natives of those countries.
   ``I don't think they had the slightest notion it affected the
people sitting there,'' he said.
   Julie Brown, vice president of the Division of Overseas
Ministries for the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), said her
experience had been different.
   ``I think the missionaries that the Disciples are sending out
today are less racist than the missionaries we were sending out 20
years ago,'' she said.
   She said many missionaries from her church, appointed for
specific terms and specifically invited by overseas organizations,
speak not in terms of ``making a tremendous impact'' on the places
they visit but of enriching their local churches when they come
back.
   Missionaries who say their only reason for going overseas is
that they feel called by God ``are the first people we weed out. It
usually means they have a paternalistic attitude,'' she said.
   Romero sees hope for the future in the recruitment of younger
missionaries and more minority missionaries.
   ``There is great value to having people who have lived with
racism, who have lived with oppression in their own countries,'' he
said.
   In addition, churches are adjusting to vast shifts in
membership, with congregations swelling in Africa and Latin America
as branches in Europe and the United States remain merely stable
or, in some places, wither.
   Brown noted that the Disciples of Christ will have more members
in Zaire than in the United States by the year 2000, and that the
denomination has cut its corps of overseas missionaries in half, to
110, over two decades.
   Such changes have prompted new attitudes toward mission work,
Yount said.
   Participants at a recent meeting of the World Council of
Churches agreed, he said, that ``if we're really going to have the
sending of missionaries, we really need to have the exchange of
missionaries.''

<HEAD>Arts Controversy Could Lead to Election-Year Reprisals</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of controversy and hours of
debate, an angry congressional argument over federal art subsidies
could boil down to 30 seconds _ the standard length of a campaign
ad on television.
   ``We live in fear of how someone could portray our vote in a
30-second political ad,'' said Sen. Herbert H. Kohl, D-Wis., who
nonetheless voted against sweeping restrictions proposed by Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., on the use of funds by the National Endowment
for the Arts. But for the threat of election-year reprisals, Kohl
said, Helms' proposal wouldn't have been treated as serious
business.
   Helms said the issue was whether taxpayers should be forced to
help pay for dirty pictures advertised as art. His opponents said
it was censorship versus artistic freedom.
   As is customary, both sides overstated the case, at great length.
   ``The definition of art is an issue for the academy, not the
legislature,'' Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., had said when the issue
arose last summer. The legislature proved that point. Coats
supported the Helms restrictions, saying the question was one of
controlling the use of tax dollars, not deciding what is or isn't
art.
   But Congress did take a role in that determination 25 years ago,
when the art subsidy system was created, although it delegated the
job of defining art to panels of experts in the hope it would be
insulated against politics. The arts endowment has made about
85,000 grants, and only about 20 had been called into question
before.
   The insulation broke down four months ago over a $30,000 NEA
subsidy to help finance a showing of 150 photographs by Robert
Mapplethorpe, among them pictures of homosexual acts and of naked
children. The exhibit was assembled by a Philadelphia arts group
after Mapplethorpe died of AIDS early this year. A second
controversy arose over a $15,000 grant to another photographer
whose works included a picture of a crucifix in a jar of urine.
   With those incitements, some congressional punishment was
inevitable. Congress voted to cut a symbolic $45,000 out of the
$171 million NEA budget for next year. They set up a commission to
study changes in the way the arts agency decides who should get
subsidies. And they voted a ban on federal aid to art that is
obscene.
   The latter provision will make it more difficult for the
religious right to proceed with its threat to tell voters that
members who voted against the sweeping Helms amendment are on
record in support of subsidized pornography.
   Helms complained last week that the system has the government
support artists whose work the taxpayers won't support in the
marketplace.
   That's exactly what the system does. Advocates say that is why
it is needed. But this argument is not about support for starving
artists, it is over government aid to exhibits, in this case
photographs, most voters would consider at least vulgar, possibly
obscene, in any case offensive.
   Nobody in Congress defended the photographs that stirred the
dispute. Defenders of the NEA system called support for those works
mistakes in an operation that generally works well.
   ``We fully recognize that no government can call artistic
excellence into existence,'' President Lyndon B. Johnson said when
the agency was created. ``It must flow from the quality of the
society and the good fortune of the nation. Nor should any
government seek to restrict the freedom of the artist to pursue his
calling in his own way.''
   The measure was designed to put the artistic decisions in the
hands of outside experts, not government. But Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., one of the sponsors of the original act, said Johnson meant
freedom, not license.
   The line between the two always has been hard to find.
   Helms wanted Congress to ban arts aid to anything denigrating
religion _ or even ``nonreligion'' _ and to works deemed indecent
or obscene. Those are difficult words to define, but Helms is a
master at reducing complex issues to black and white test votes.
When his amendment was adopted on July 26, without a recorded vote,
Helms said that any senator who wanted the government funding
pornography should vote against him.
   When it was scrapped in negotiations with the House, Helms
revived the issue last Thursday night and forced it to a roll call.
``All I wanted was for the senators to look at the pictures and
then vote as they please and then answer to the folks back home,''
he said.
   ``... Some day, if you vote against this amendment,'' said Sen.
Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., who did, ``... somebody is going to run
that 30-second ad and say `Senator So-and-so supports pornography,
Senator So-and-so wants your tax dollars spent on pornography...''
   Helms' amendment was defeated 62 to 35, and a morning-after
version was revised into the obscenity ban.
   That leaves an issue and sends a message. From now on, the
panels that decide who gets federal arts subsidies are likely to do
their erring on the side of caution.

<HEAD>MTV's Colin Quinn Stars in Comedy Special `Back to Brooklyn'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Well, it's not `Long Day's Journey into
Night' or anything.''
   Comedian Colin Quinn, the star of MTV's ``Colin Quinn Back to
Brooklyn,'' isn't after high art. His comedy special, airing
Saturday at 11 p.m. and Sunday at 7:30 p.m., just wants to have
fun, any weird way it can.
   ``Back to Brooklyn'' is composed of a series of sometimes
bizarre sketches, most of them mocking pop culture icons. The
half-hour show opens with a parody of the pretentious rock
documentary ``Rattle and Hum,'' about the Irish band U2.
   ``The show was a fantasy thing because there was so much freedom
in what we could do,'' Quinn said in an interview. ``MTV is not
like the networks. They just let you do what you want to do. If you
went to a network and said, `We want to parody ``Rattle and Hum,''
' they'd say, `What's that?' And then they'd say, `Well the people
in so-and-so don't know what that is.'
   ``MTV is not like that.''
   Quinn is one of the co-hosts on ``Remote Control,'' MTV's
irreverent, off-the-wall game show that is also a hit in
syndication.
   On ``Remote Control,'' Quinn badly sings pop songs that
contestants have to finish. In ``Colin's Wheel of Torture,''
another of the game's fixtures, players must undergo such tortures
as a Wet Willie (Quinn's wet finger is stuck into the player's ear)
to win points.
   Like ``Remote Control,'' ``Back to Brooklyn'' revels in poking
fun at entertainers.
   The skits include a spoof of a rap rock video and a performance
by a combination lounge act-Catholic priest. ``Like the robe?'' the
priest says of his vestments. ``Got it at the Italian restaurant at
the corner. Used to be a tablecloth. Ouch!''
   In another brief sketch, Quinn returns to his Brooklyn home,
only to be upstaged by an unusual wake for his Uncle Dermott, laid
to rest with his glasses on.
   And in a parody titled ``I Dream of Gina,'' Quinn delivers a
fairly accurate but weird imitation of Robert de Niro as a man
convinced his wife is casting magic spells on all the men she meets.
   ``Everything is getting so serious. There are not enough people
out there trying to break down things,'' Quinn said.
   ``I think audiences are dying for it. I don't know anybody
anymore who watches regular TV and doesn't have a lot of complaints
about it, saying, `I can't believe how bad it is.' It's like
everything getting's so moralistic and formulaic.''
   He acknowledged, ``There are a lot of things in this special
that people won't get. But some people will get some things, and
some people will get other things. The beauty is we don't have to
worry about that.''
   ``Back to Brooklyn'' is presented with the same false
seriousness that has become a trademark of many documentaries these
days.
   ``Basically, what the special is it's me going back to Brooklyn,
coming back in contact with my roots, you know, this kind of
thing,'' Quinn says at the show's start. ``My agent didn't want me
to do it.''
   His fictional talent agent (played by the show's director, Ben
Stiller) is a misguided wheeler-dealer whose clients include diver
Greg Louganis, actor Kirk Cameron and every no-talent in between.
   The agent's ideas include a new movie based on ``Batman'' and
``Do the Right Thing.'' The title: ``Do the Robin Thing,'' where
the Boy Wonder is stuck delivering pizzas.
   ``I just want to do that stuff that's funny. If I could just do
a few more of these, that'd be fine,'' Quinn said. ``We hardly even
made money on this. But I didn't care. I just want to do good
stuff.''

<TEXT>
   In politics, one of the safest, popular,
commendable and perhaps rewarding stances is to be for the poor,
especially through government transfer programs.
   Politically speaking, it is an assumption not to be questioned
that transfers of money from the rich to the poor will, over time,
improve chances of the poor obtaining a larger percentage of the
nation's income.
   But it might not be so. In that respect, the safe, popular and
commendable political stance might also be one of the least
effective, says Professor Dwight Lee in a paper for the Center for
the Study of American Business, St. Louis.
   Lee's position will create controversy, but that's what every
unpopular notion does in the world of economics. It may be true
also that he will never be able to prove the case, but it certainly
will get an airing.
   Indeed, one reason why Lee challenged the assumption was its
casual acceptance not just by politicians and economists, but by
other segments of economic society and the general public. And the
cost, of course, was another reason.
   Lee, who teaches at the University of Georgia, contends that if
government transfer programs were helping the poor then income
distribution would have become more equal as spending on poverty
programs rose over the years.
   It hasn't happened, he says. He refers to studies showing that
income distribution has remained almost stable over the past four
decades. He cites one study of income between 1950 and 1970 that
showed:
   _Households in the lowest 20 percent of income distribution
received 6.4 percent of the national net income in 1950 and 6.7
percent in 1970.
   _Households in the top 20 percent of income distribution
received 39.9 percent of national net income in 1950 and 39.1
percent in 1970.
   That, says Lee, is very little impact for the billions of
dollars spent. It is so little, he maintains, that you might also
assume that to drastically reduce such spending might do little to
worsen poverty.
   How could this possibly be? He believes the answer lies in the
nature of politics and the marketplace.
   Poverty, he says, is thought to result from a marketplace driven
by competition among self-seeking individuals who have little
concern for broad social outcomes. If so, he says, the same is true
in politics.
   ``Is it not at least a plausible assumption,'' he asks, ``that
people are as self-regarding in one setting as another?''
   The political process, like the market process, ``is driven by
competition between individuals who are interested in promoting
their private objectives,'' he says. Some of those objectives, it
seems, don't always help the poor.
   Even altruistic people, Lee claims, too often simply lobby for
or against existing government programs that provide specific
benefits _ rather than the objective of reducing overall poverty.
They might see no alternative.
   Sometimes the poverty advocates are made up of those whose
employment is tied to programs, leading him to point out that:
   ``Poverty professionals have an overriding interest in their
incomes and job security and favor the continuation and expansion
of funding for poverty programs for reasons completely divorced
from any benefits the poor receive.''
   In short, as Lee sees it, the motivation in politics is the same
as in the marketplace. If elimination of poverty is the goal, few
seem interested in determining whether programs do indeed work to
reduce poverty.
   Why don't the poor themselves have more input? For one thing,
the group is always changing; relatively few households remain in
poverty for a decade or so. As a political constituency, poverty
lacks permanency.
   The very small percentage of permanently poor, he says, often
are incapable of being competitive politically, and for the same
reasons they aren't competitive economically. They don't have the
skills, he says.

<TEXT>
   Another kind of combat _ kite fighting
_ draws hundreds of Afghans to the fields on the edge of Kabul on
Friday afternoons.
   They call it ``the game'' and some bet the equivalent of $10 _
the monthly wage of a starting government employee _ on the outcome.
   Kites fly over Kabul all the time, especially in the strong
winds that follow a rainstorm. They are the favorite of most
children because other toys are too expensive and kites are cheap.
All it takes to make a kite are some bright paper, bamboo sticks
and string, usually costing a dollar or two. Those who can't afford
the favored paper from Germany make do with plastic bags.
   ``School children invented kites,'' said Mohammid Nabi Delaghah,
43, one of the kite sellers around the Shor Bazaar who promote the
idea that Afghan children were the first to make kites.
   Told that other accounts have it that kites originated in China
around the time the Great Wall was being built, he concedes that
maybe Afghans only invented fighting with them.
   ``Two people with kites had a war 90 years ago,'' said Delaghah.
``A guy named Osman Bijo got a medal after he won the fight.''
   The rules for ``the game'' call for the competing kites to be
the same size with string from the same country _ supposedly to
assure that both will be of the same strength. But the specialists
say the real strength comes in the amount of crushed glass that is
glued onto the string: too much makes it inflexible; not enough
makes it weak.
   ``It's my specialty, but I won't show anybody how to make good
line,'' said Khan Shareen, a recognized expert on the string.
   When the kites get 900 to 1,200 feet up, the battle starts with
a nod or a shout between the duelers _ men usually in their 30s and
40s.
   A cry goes up from the spectators: ``They're fighting! They're
fighting!''
   A fight takes about 15 minutes.
   Qari Gholam Samih, 35, said he has not lost a kite in two years
of fighting. He said he spent five years just getting ready.
   The trick, he said, is ``to be brave, to have no fear.''
   The real war occasionally intercedes. Last winter a helicopter
came roaring over the field and took down about 50 kites.
   Kites are even part of Afghan literature. A famous short story,
``Word of Honor'' by Akram Osman, made into a movie, centers around
a kite maker from the Shor Bazaar who wants to marry his cousin.
   ``It would've been wonderful if the kites had eyes like yours,''
the kite maker says in the opening scene.
   The cousin's father, however, opposes the union, keeping his
daughter at home and even changing houses when the kite maker
successfully lands a kite that says ``Happy Holidays'' into their
courtyard.
   Then the story takes a certain Afghan twist _ the kite maker
takes up body building and beats the woman's brother at wrestling.
Only then is he allowed to marry the cousin.

<HEAD>Knights of Malta Returning to Island They Once Ruled</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: The knights return Oct. 17-22.</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<HEAD>By TERRY LEONARD</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two centuries after Napoleon's
forces routed them, the Knights of Malta are returning to the
island they got from an emperor in exchange for a falcon and ruled
for 268 years.
   The ``monks in armor'' will be here Oct. 17-22 for a gathering
their leadership hopes will help bolster Malta's economy.
   Officially named the Sovereign Military Order of the Hospital of
St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, the knights are the
oldest order of chivalry and the fourth oldest religious order in
the Roman Catholic Church.
   They ruled this rocky and almost barren Mediterranean
archipelago from 1530, when Emperor Charles V gave it to them for
the price of one trained falcon a year, until 1798 when Napoleon
sent them packing without the treasures they acquired during
centuries of plundering the Ottoman Empire.
   Fra Andrew Bertie, the 78th grand master of the 900-year-old
order, has summoned the knights back and has urged them to help
Malta improve its economy.
   For centuries, membership in the knights required proof of
generations of nobility. Although some ranks today are open to
those without noble ancestry, the rolls are still crowded with the
wealthy and influential.
   The New York financier J. Peter Grace is a member, as are former
U.S. Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig, Premier Giulio Andreotti
and President Francesco Cossiga of Italy and Giovanni Agnelli,
chairman of the Italian automobile company Fiat. Edward Bennett
Williams, the Washington attorney and owner of the Baltimore
Orioles major league baseball team who died in August 1988, also
was a member.
   Such men are one reason the order's Maltese association asked
Bertie to call the knights back to Malta, which in 25 years of
independence from Britain has found the economic road as rocky as
its coastline.
   Bertie, a long-time former resident of Malta, encourged knights
worldwide to attend the first world gathering of the order and
openly solicited their help.
   ``I also urge those of you who are directly or indirectly
interested in facilitating contacts with the development of the
economic life of the island to do so,'' Bertie told the knights
earlier this year in New York.
   Roger de Giorgio, president of the Maltese association of the
ancient order now based in Rome, said about 500 of the 10,000
members are expected to travel to Malta.
   ``We want knights from around the world to exchange ideas about
our hospital work and to rediscover Malta,'' said de Giorgio.
``During the 268 years the knights were here, they introduced new
thinking in architecture, law, medicine and merchant shipping.''
   The knights made Malta a thriving center of Christianity and
trade. De Giorgio said the knights also gave Malta the legal codes
that are the basis for much of its modern law. In 1575, they built
and then operated what then was one of the largest hospitals in
Europe. They gave Malta an architectural heritage of massive
fortifications and magnificent palaces and churches.
   The knights today operate about 200 hospitals and first aid
centers in 90 countries, especially in the Third World and war
zones.
   The order was founded in the late 11th century with the opening
of a hospice for pilgrims in Jerusalem. Its centuries-old
dedication to hospital work began when it treated the sick and
wounded after the army of the First Crusade captured Jerusalem in
1099.
   It first took up arms in the 12th century to defend the pilgrim
routes to the Holy Land.
   In the late 13th century, after the Holy Land fell to the
Moslems, the knights moved first to Cyrpus and then to Rhodes where
they built a navy to fight the Moslem Ottoman Empire.
   Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent defeated the knights and forced
them to leave Rhodes on Jan. 1, 1523, although with huge losses to
his troops.
   Seven years later, the knights resumed the fight from Malta.
Once again Suleiman attacked. This time 600 knights, 1,230 mostly
Spanish soldiers and about 6,000 Maltese militia defeated an
Ottoman army of 40,000. That victory in 1565 marked the beginning
of the end for Ottoman seapower and earned the knights the
gratitude of a threatened Europe.

<BYLINE>After 200 Years, Jesuits Return To Fight for Indians' Rights ^By
PETER McFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN IGNACIO DE MOXOS, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two centuries
after their expulsion by the Spanish crown, Jesuit priests are back
in this tropical outpost to champion the rights of Indians and a
shrinking wilderness.
   ``I always try to think in terms of how the Jesuits of 200 years
ago would have handled a problem,'' said the Rev. Enrique Jordan
Arias, a leader in the local Indians' battle with timber companies
exploiting the mahogany forests.
   ``We try to follow that Jesuit heritage in our fight with the
woodcutters,'' he told a visiting Associated Press reporter. ``San
Ignacio is where the Jesuit tradition is best preserved, and where
it is replanted in terms of modern problems.''
   San Ignacio de Moxos, on the vast eastern Bolivian savannah
called the Beni, was founded by Jesuits in 1689 as part of the
religious order's missionary penetration of South America's
heartland during Spain's colonial period.
   At the mission the Jesuits brought 14 Indian communities
together in a communal society and taught them weaving, carpentry,
cermanics, music and agriculture. They introduced cattle ranching
and coffee and peanut farming.
   One Jesuit priest, Francisco Eder, described the Indians' life
in an 18th century book as one of ``peace and tranquility, with an
abundance of food and clothing.''
   In 1768, the missionaries were forced to abandon San Ignacio de
Moxos, expelled with all members of their order across South
America by a Spanish crown that considered their motives and
technique subversive.
   The outpost survived but even now, with 6,000 inhabitants, it
remains remote. A dirt road winds northeastward for 270 miles to
the capital city of La Paz high in the Andes mountains. It is
impassable in the rainy season and always treacherous.
   ``This town has become a crossroads for lumbermen, merchants,
cocaine traffickers and ranchers,'' Jordan Arias, 50, said.
   His order returned to San Ignacio de Moxos in 1982 with three
priests. They function from a whitewashed church with elaborately
carved altars and furniture painted red, yellow and purple, all
dating back to the Jesuits' original stay.
   They also observe some of the founding traditions, including the
annual procession in which a statue of San Ignacio, the town's
patron saint, is carried around the square by the priests, town
officials, prominent citizens and Indians of the local Moxo tribe.
   Some Indians wear feather headdresses, wooden masks or other
colorful costumes and march to the accompaniment of long bamboo
woodwinds, playing a music taught to their ancestors by the
original Jesuits.
   When the ceremony ends, the European-descended townspeople and
the Indian descendants go their separate ways. This unofficial but
deeply entrenched racial discrimination is as abominable to the
Jesuits now as it was in the 1600s, when they were sharply critical
of the Spaniards' treatment of Indians.
   ``There are two worlds in this town,'' Jordan Arias said. ``They
go to school together, but then the whites go to their social club
and the Indians go to their social and spiritual center.
   ``One notices a great deal of discrimination and hostility
between the white and Indian communities,'' he said. Many Indians
are used as poorly paid laborers by white landowners and merchants.
   The church has published books and pamphlets detailing the rich
cultural heritage of the Moxo Indians and recently helped organize
a national conference on tropical forests and Indian rights that
attracted hundreds of delegates here.
   ``The legacy of the Jesuits is a better civilization and for
people to care for each other as brothers,'' said Antonio Coseruna,
the 36-year-old president of the Moxo Indian Council.
   ``The Jesuits are now teaching us how to defend our rights, and
to demand better pay,'' he said. ``The white men don't like the
Jesuits because ... before it was easy for the white men to cheat
us.''
   The government has given seven timber companies rights to the
vast forests around San Ignacio. But in response to a
Jesuit-sponsored public campaign, it now is considering a law that
would declare part of the wilderness an Indian reservation and
regulate the harvest of mahogany and other valuable hardwoods.
   For years, standard practice has been to remove worthwhile
timber then let settlers burn off the rest of the forest for
farming, which quickly exhausted the thin layer of topsoil. Left
behind are huge tracts of worthless, barren land.
   ``In 10 years, there will be no forests and animals left,''
Coseruna said.
   Not all whites resent the return of the Jesuits. They get high
praise from Ana Maria Ruiz de Antelo, 30, president of the town
council and member of a prominent cattle-ranching family, who has
worked to revive the Indian tradition in handicrafts that
languished after the Jesuits were ousted.
   ``The Jesuits,'' she said, ``have returned to awaken and defend
indigenous people because they have nobody else to protect them.''

<HEAD>Manufacturers Seek a Piece of the Alternative-Fuel Pie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid the morning rush of commuters, the white
Ford Taurus blended well with the hundreds of other cars on
Washington's traffic-clogged six-lane Beltway.
   But as the sedan passed an 18-wheeler at 60 miles an hour, the
driver flicked a switch just below the dashboard and the Taurus
became like no other car on the busy highway.
   It was now running on propane instead of gasoline.
   As Congress moves toward enacting tougher laws to combat urban
pollution and other environmental concerns, including global
warming, the word is out: The 1990s may well become the decade in
which the alternative-fuel automobile with its fewer pollutants
will challenges the conventional gasoline-powered car.
   President Bush has proposed legislation calling for a phase-in
of thousands of alternative-fuel vehicles beginning in 1995 and for
production of at least 1 million such cars a year by 1997 in urban
areas with the worst smog.
   William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
says there is no other way to attain a significant reduction in
urban smog and still acknowledge Americans' love of their
automobiles than to phase in large numbers of cars that use cleaner
fuels than gasoline.
   As a result, there has been a rush to Washington by almost every
conceivable maker and promoter of alternative fuels in an attempt
to carve out a niche in that yet-to-be-defined future market of
motor vehicles.
   The parking lots on Capital Hill were dotted one day recently
with vehicles powered by various fuels from propane to hydrogen.
   Among then were:
   _A transit bus with a specially designed engine powered by
natural gas.
   _A Mercedes-Benz sedan powered by an experimental solar-hydrogen
system.
   _Vehicles from beer and pizza trucks to mid-size sedans all
fueled by propane.
   The propane-powered sedans _ including the white Taurus _ were
equipped with duel-fuel systems that allowed with a touch of a
switch to shift from unleaded gasoline to propane, even at highway
speeds, with hardly a notice.
   But the alternative fuel most talked about for passenger cars _
and cited specifically by Bush _ is methanol, a liquid that comes
from methane, the main component of natural gas. Methanol is in
large supply, requires no pressurization and could be dispensed
from service station pumps alongside those offering gasoline.
   Methanol has been so widely discussed that producers of other
alternative fuels have sent their representatives to Capitol Hill
to complain that it is the only substitute fuel the EPA and the
White House are interested in.
   ``What we're striving for with the EPA and the legislative
(lobbying) is a level playing field,'' said Bob Meyers, executive
vice president for marketing at Petrolane Inc., the country's
largest retailer of propane. He said there is clear evidence of a
``bias'' toward methanol in Washington.
   Top EPA officials do tilt toward methanol and White House
counsel C. Boyden Gray has made no secret of his views on the fuel.
He has been driving a Chevrolet Citation that runs on alcohol for
several years.
   ``Many people have portrayed the administration as being
dominated by methanol junkies,'' Patrick Quinn, the EPA's director
of congressional liaison, told a propane industry group, insisting
that such a characterization is not true.
   In an interview, Quinn acknowleged that methanol appears to be a
``fuel of choice'' as an alternative to gasoline for most passenger
cars. But he said the agency plans to establish pollution standards
for other fuels as well and envisions both propane and compressed
natural gas as eventually gaining significant niches, especially in
such areas as fleet vehicles and transit buses.
   There already are an estimated 350,000 propane-powered vehicles
in use nationwide, almost exclusively in fleet operations.
   Among them are more than 250 taxis in Las Vegas, 160 school
buses in Kansas City, Kan., sheriff's department cars in Sarasota,
Fla., and a variety of delivery trucks. Propane has been used in
farm vehicles for years.
   But propane still is primarily used for heating, with only about
3 percent of sales going to vehicles. ``What we see now is a golden
opportunity (for expansion). The niche we see is really in the
fleet industry,'' says Jerry Schmitt, a marketing consultant for
Ferrellgas, a major propane retailer.
   But all this talk of substitute fuels for gasoline has not
escaped notice of the petroleum industry.
   Atlantic Richfield Co. recently announced it would begin
offering a reformulated, cleaner-burning leaded gasoline for older
cars. Other oil companies reportedly are developing cleaner-burning
unleaded gasoline and plan soon to put them in test markets in
light of the expected tighter air pollution standards being debated
in Congress.
   Meanwhile, the oil industry has unleashed a public relations
assault on methanol, including newspaper ads saying that it is
highly toxic and even small amounts could be fatal if swallowed;
that it releases formaldehyde, an ozone-causing and probably
carcinogenic pollutant; and that it would likely be more expensive
than gasoline.
   The EPA responded with a report on methanol saying that the fuel
remains a sound alternative, that its expected price will be
competitive with gasoline and that its safety risks are no greater
than with other fuels, including gasoline.

<HEAD>Nissan Axxess: Two Sliding Doors Make It a Dream for Parents</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Good news for harried parents of toddlers. The 1990 Nissan
Axxess minivan is especially for you.
   The Axxess is the first small van with a sliding passenger door
on each side of the vehicle, and that makes it easy for parents to
extricate little ones from the back seat.
   Forget about folding yourself in two and climbing inside to get
at the kids. With the Axxess' handy doors, you can just reach in
from either side. Imagine how this could cut down on wailing time.
   And no need to worry about the young ones opening the doors as
you drive. Both doors are fitted with child-proof locks that allow
opening only from the outside.
   This vehicle also should appeal to buyers who want the
versatility of a van and the safety of a car; as Nissan notes, the
Axxess is the first minivan that meets safety standards for
passenger cars.Vans are categorized as trucks under federal
regulations and therefore need not meet the more rigid car safety
guidelines.
   The Axxess, however, has 5-mph bumpers, a high-mounted rear
brake light, side-door beams for protection in side crashes,
passive seatbelts up front and three-point seat belts in back _ all
standard equipment.
   Although available in front-drive mode, the Nissan Axxess offers
even better traction with its all-wheel-drive version, which was
the test vehicle. In a sudden thunderstorm, the Axxess
all-wheel-drive offered surefooted control and peace of mind.
Because of its size _ bigger than a sedan but smaller than other
minivans _ the vehicle also maneuvered easily.
   The all-wheel-drive test model was powered by the standard
2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine that produced 138 horsepower and
was paired with a four-speed automatic overdrive transmission.
   The Axxess wouldn't win acceleration derbies, and I noticed a
couple of jerks as I put it through some paces and the transmission
sought the right gear. But the fuel economy of 18 mpg in the city
and 22 mpg on the highway is close to that of other,
two-wheel-drive minivans.
   For example, Mazda's MPV with automatic transmission is rated at
19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway, while the Plymouth
Voyager automatic with four-cylinder engine gets 21 mpg in the city
and 23 mpg on the highway.
   Nissan expects Axxess buyers to fit the young family profile.
The targeted median age for buyers is the mid-30s, and they are
likely to have some college education. With a household income of
around $38,000, they will be on a fairly tight budget, said company
spokesman E.C. Mueller.
   ``They're not looking for something faddish, they want quality
and style,'' he said. ``Nissan wanted to give them something that's
comfortable, fun to drive, where you don't feel you're stuffed in a
box.''
   That's why the Axxess has so much glass. The dashboard area is
expansive, and there are even tiny windows alongside the curving
dash. The sunroof on the test model added a feeling of space, as
did the headrests with holes cut in the middle. I noted, however,
that all that glass lets in a lot of sunlight and could quickly
make for a hot interior on 90-degree summer days. That's where the
air conditioning came in handy.
   The test vehicle had seating for seven. But rather than the
typical minivan arrangement where two people sit in the middle and
three in the back, the Axxess had a three-passenger seat in the
middle and a two-passenger bench in back.
   To reach the rear-most seat, you must fold forward the seatback
at one end of the middle seat, then lift the entire folded middle
seat forward against the front seat. It took a little getting used
to but worked well once I got the hang of it.
   The rear door opened easily and offered access to a space behind
the third seat big enough for several grocery bags. To get more
cargo room, you must remove the rear seat headrests, flip the seat
cushion forward and the rear seatback down. That, too, took a
little practice.
   Minimum legroom for the rear-most seat made this position
best-suited for children. The middle seat was better, although the
backs of the front seats still hit my legs if they were pushed all
the way back and reclined a bit.
   Nissan expects U.S. sales of about 18,000 in the 1989 and 1990
model years combined. The Axxess made its U.S. debut in late March,
and sales through the first six months totaled more than 2,000. The
Axxess has been sold as the Prairie in Japan since September 1988.
   Because the Axxess is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports magazine
does not list an owner's trouble report.

   Harold Clark Simmons is a busy billionaire, but he
needs to be to reach his goal of leaving more money for medical
research than Howard Hughes.
   ``Money brings a lot of responsibility as to what you're going
to do with it, and I've given quite a bit of thought to that,''
Simmons said in an interview during which he gave a rare insight
into the thoughts and actions of one of the nation's wealthiest
investors.
   ``Basically my decisions have been largely to funnel most of the
funds that I have available for discretionary giving to medical
research,'' said Simmons, who suffers from arthritis, a painful
inflammation of the joints.
   Last year, he gave $41 million to the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas for cancer and arthritis
research and his goal is to at least match the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute.
   Hughes, the reclusive industrialist who died in 1976, had
created the institute 23 years earlier and given it sole ownership
of Hughes Aircraft Co.
   In the mid-1980s, the institute sold Hughes Aircraft to General
Motors Corp. for $5.2 billion. Today, the institute's endowment is
about $6.5 billion, making it the nation's largest private
philanthropic foundation.
   ``I won't cry if I don't make it, or I won't boast if I get over
that,'' Simmons said. ``I think that's a nice round figure. It's
realistic.''
   Simmons, 58, is well on his way, increasing his wealth at an
average of almost $14 million a month in the 12 years since he
cashed the stock he received from selling his Texas drug store
chain to Jack Eckerd Corp.
   He began the chain with $5,000 in cash and a $95,000 loan to buy
a drug store near Southern Methodist University. Through a series
of acquisitions, he built up to 100 stores before selling to Eckerd
for stock worth an estimated $50 million.
   Restrictions on that stock, however, prevented him from selling
immediately. The stock had declined to about $12 million before he
could unload it.
   With that $12 million, the son of two rural Texas school
teachers has built a fortune bumping $2 billion through a
combination of takeovers and stock plays involving some of
American's biggest companies.
   Lately, Simmons has become a more public figure, granting
interviews and disputing his past image among some of his targets
as a bad guy.
   ``I don't think I have a black hat image,'' he said. ``I think
that I'm certainly feared and dreaded, and maybe not highly
regarded by management of public companies that don't own very much
stock in the company.
   ``I'm not trying to change an image, I'm just trying to make
sure that the facts match the image. The facts are basically that
I'm a builder. I have not dissembled any company nor split up any
companies, nor do I ever buy any companies with that intent.''
   While other high-stakes investors are either dormant or prowling
overseas, Simmons has at least two major plays under way. He
continues to buy stock in Lockheed Corp., now holding more than 10
percent, and is awaiting Georgia Gulf Corp. management's response
to his almost 10 percent stake in the company.
   ``I think the thing that I've done well, the thing that I've
been able to make money on, is simply evaluating the public
information ... of public companies,'' Simmons said.
   ``And based on that information, I've made some decisions and
taken some actions that have resulted in most of my wealth, so I
think that's what I have a talent for. It's a fairly narrow talent,
and you're not always right.''
   Simmons claims to be lazy, arriving at the office late and
leaving early. He also likes to play tennis, ride dirt bikes and
fly in his private jet, although in person he displays none of that
energy.
   Instead, he barely moved during an interview at his North Dallas
office, discussing in subdued tones his life as corporate takeover
strategist and unabashed capitalist.
   Since 1977, Simmons has bought and sold stock in 16 companies,
taking profits of $328.9 million, holding the stock from as short
as a month to as long as three years.
   His biggest absolute gain came in 1987 when he sold his 17.9
percent stake in GAF Corp. for $197.9 million three years after
investing $58 million.
   Simmons denies he has ever been a greenmailer.
   ``Greenmail is when you threaten a company and you go sell your
stock to the company so they'll get rid of you and nobody else gets
to sell their stock,'' Simmons said, whereas all stockholders
benefit from his activity.
   ``I definitely have a shareholders' perspective,'' Simmons said.
``I'm not doing that altruistically. I'm doing that because it's in
my own self interest to do it. I think that's good for my other
shareholders because they go along with me: If I do well for
myself, then they do well for themselves.''
   Simmons also has kept a fair share of his holdings, the most
valuable stemming from his 1986 purchase of NL Industries Inc. for
about $300 million. The investment now is worth an estimated $1.2
billion.
   Another key play was the 1982 buyout of Amalgamated Sugar Co. in
a $35 million deal. He later sold an unprofitable joint venture for
$30 million giving him a total cost of about $5 million for the
company. He said he recently turned down more than $330 million in
cash for the sugar beet processor.
   Simmons said his decisions to keep or sell, and whether to take
a company private or leave it public are based on money.
   ``If I had all the money in the world, I wouldn't have any
public companies. The minority interest in NL Industries would cost
about $650 million to $700 million ... so I've got to evaluate that
alternative vs. the alternative of just buying something else. In
this case, my decision is to leave the minority interest in there.
Let them be partners, let them prosper if I do.''
   As for operating a company, ``I very seldom buy, take a major
stock position in, any company that I would not be willing to buy
all that company at the price I'm paying for it,'' Simmons said.
   ``Many people think you just decide there's a company you want
to buy, period, and you want to buy it regardless of what it costs.
I don't.
   ``I want to buy a company if I can buy it for what I think is
less than it's worth to me,'' he said.
   ``If it gets higher than that, I'll sell.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he will nominate former
Sen. Barry Goldwater to be a member of the board of directors of
Communications Satellite Corp.
   The Arizona Republican, 80, is currently a public affairs
professor at Arizona State University in Tempe, Ariz., and resides
in Scottsdale, Ariz.
   If confirmed by the Senate, where he served for 25 years,
Goldwater would succeed E. Pendleton James. The term extends
through 1992.
   The corporation, also known as COMSAT, is a congressionally
mandated corporation that provides communications statellite
services and represents the United States in the international
satellite telecommunications organization.
   Bush, who made the announcement Tuesday, was an active supporter
of Goldwater in 1964 when Bush ran unsuccessfully for the U.S.
Senate and Goldwater ran unsuccessfully for the presidency.

<HEAD>CEO Survey: Most Top Corporate Execs Conservative, White Men</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The typical top corporate executive is a
conservative, white, Protestant male, with a traditional family
life and a military background, according to a nationwide survey.
   The survey by the Wall Street Journal also found that corporate
leaders believe their business practices are more ethical now than
a decade ago, generally would hesitate to promote a homosexual to
management level and believe it's lonely at the top.
   The survey looks at the personal lives and habits of 351 chief
executive officers of the nation's biggest companies and offers a
profile of who's running corporate America. Detailed results will
be published this month in ``The Wall Street Journal Book of Chief
Executive Style.''
   The typical profile of a successful chief is a conservative one,
according to the survey. Results were based partly on interviews
with the chief executives by a team of Journal reporters over the
past year.
   Most of the nation's corporate honchos have three children, have
been married to the same stay-at-home woman for 20 years and have
served in the armed forces, according to the survey. One in four
grew up in the Mid-Atlantic states of New York, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.
   They're mostly college educated but only 35 percent have masters
degrees, and 12.5 percent earned doctorates _ generally at a
non-Ivy League school. About 5 percent have no degree at all, like
Charles Lazarus of Toys R Us Inc., Howard Sells of F.W. Woolworth
Co. or Martin S. Davis of Amerada Hess Corp.
   The CEOs usually work 10 to 12 hours a day, plus weekends, and
take at least three weeks of vacation each year, usually in
Florida. Only 2.8 percent of those surveyed took no vacation in
1986.
   An overwhelming majority, 71 percent, believe that in general
CEOs of major corporations are more ethical in their business
practices today than they were 10 years ago.
   Reflecting their apparent conservatism, some 66 percent said
they would hesitate to promote a homosexual to management-committee
level.
   Although the survey dealt with weighty questions such as ethics
and minority promotions, the Journal book makes only a brief
mention of those issues. Norm Pearlstein, editor-in-chief of the
Journal, said those issues were not explored further because the
thrust of the book was on CEO lifesytles and working habits.
   Despite their salaries and perks, the executives say their
everyday behavior in many areas tends to be similar to that of the
average, middle-class Joe.
   J. Richard Munro of Time Inc. commutes to work in Manhattan
every day on the crowded 6:02 a.m. train out of New Canaan, Conn.,
an area where many CEOs live to avoid the income taxes of
neighboring New York. He also speaks fondly of the pleasures
derived from mowing his own lawn.
   Roger Smith of General Motors Corp. admits that he likes to eat
fast food with the masses. ``Sure we go to McDonald's. I like
McDonald's hamburgers,'' he says.
   But socializing with subordinates is another story. Many said
that after they made it to the top they felt limited in the number
of personal relationships they could maintain, preferring to
socialize with other chief executives.
   ``If you're socializing with one executive and not others,
you're sending messages to those you don't see that they should not
be getting,'' said DuPont's Irving Shapiro.
   CEOs tend to meet each other at private clubs, where they're
likely to dine on seafood instead of red meat and drink as much
wine as they do scotch. About 92 percent of those surveyed said
they drink, but only 3 percent will imbibe at lunch.
   Although 59 percent play golf, only 6 percent cited it as their
favorite sport.
   For clothing, navy blue suits, white shirts and red power ties
were the surveyed executives' preferred attire. Black pinstripe
suits, paisley ties and pink, pastel and yellow shirts are least
favored.
   Many CEOs also have their own brand of ``diplomatic
doubletalk,'' the survey says.
   For example, ``Let me know if I can help,'' could be translated
to, ``Don't bother me.''
   And, ``My door is always open,'' may mean, ``You can try to see
me, but it will cost you some respect and brownie points.''

<HEAD>IBM Announces Supercomputing Software Based on AT&amp;T Advance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. has
announced software for supercomputers based on a patented
breakthrough by a mathematician at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.
   AT&amp;T introduced its own package of hardware and software based
on the so-called Karmarkar algorithm last year and it appears that
IBM's entry Tuesday puts the two technology giants in direct
competition.
   An IBM press release made no mention of AT&amp;T and simply said
that part of its software's power ``stems from a new programming
method which drew worldwide attention when it was introduced a few
years ago.''
   IBM spokesman Denis Arvay, who mentioned the AT&amp;T connection,
said IBM was entitled to use the AT&amp;T patent through a
cross-licensing agreement between the companies.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Bob Ford said he could not find anyone at AT&amp;T
who knew of the IBM product and thus the company had no comment on
it.
   The Karmarkar algorithm, invented in 1984 by AT&amp;T's Narendra
Karmarkar, is a programming method for solving resource-allocation
problems that involve huge numbers of variables, such as scheduling
daily crew assignments for a major airline.
   IBM said its software was able to obtain the best solution to an
airline scheduling problem in less time than a Cray 2 supercomputer
from Cray Research Inc. reportedly took to solve a problem
one-tenth the size.
   IBM's software, known as the Optimization Subroutine Library,
runs on big 3090 mainframe computers that have add-on equipment to
make them work as supercomputers. But IBM said versions of it can
run on smaller IBM computers, even its personal computers.
   The chief creators of IBM's software were John Tomlin of IBM's
Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., and John Forrest of
the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
   AT&amp;T's hardware-software product, Korbx, was introduced in
August 1988 at a price of $8.9 million. So far there are two
customers willing to have their names publicized, the Military
Airlift Command and Delta Air Lines Inc.

<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig and
former House Speaker Tip O'Neill don't usually see eye to eye, but
they do agree on the benefits of flying the Trump Shuttle,
according to a new advertising campaign.
   Haig and O'Neill are one of several odd couples seated together
in the television and newspaper ads for the Northeast airline.
Others include author Norman Mailer with boxing promoter Don King,
and sex counselor Dr. Ruth Westheimer with fashion model Carol Alt.
   ``The Trump Shuttle: the Ultimate Connection'' is the theme of
the campaign, which starts Wednesday in the shuttle cities of New
York, Boston and Washington.
   ``Each commercial focuses on an ironic juxtaposition,'' said
Mark Messing, senior vice president at Scali, McCabe, Sloves, the
ad agency responsible for the campaign. ``We chose personalities
with little in common and asked them to engage in unscripted
conversation.
   ``In most areas _ ideology, culture, politics, style _ they
disagreed about everything, with the one common ground being their
choice of the Trump Shuttle.''
   Trump Shuttle, which developer Donald Trump bought from
strikebound Eastern Airlines in early June and renamed, has been in
a fierce battle for market share with the rival shuttle run by Pan
Am Corp. The start of the new Trump advertising campaign
corresponds with a customary fall increase in shuttle traffic.

<HEAD>Fortune Rates Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City Top Business Metro Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dallas, Atlanta and Kansas City, Mo., are the
best metropolitan areas in America for U.S. businesses, according
to rankings in a Fortune magazine survey.
   The business biweekly said Tuesday it ranked the top 10 of the
nation's largest metro areas based on such factors as labor force,
cost of doing business, economic base, infrastructure and quality
of life.
   Dallas-Fort Worth emerged on top based on its 28 percent
commercial real estate vacancy rate, large pool of ``talented
workers,'' surging population and active night life.
   ``The so-called Metroplex, embracing the suburbs and the area
between the cities, is today's dream location for business, largely
because of surplus office and factory space in the wake of the oil
bust,'' Fortune said.
   The survey results appear in the Oct. 23 issue of the magazine,
which hits newsstands on Wednesday.
   The ratings were based on the magazine's opinions and a
statistical profile compiled by the corporate location consultants
Moran Stahl &amp; Boyer, Fortune said. It also factored in the opinions
of chief executives of big companies as compiled by business real
estate firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield.
   Among the statistical factors were labor supply growth since
1983, rate of growth in taxes, government bond ratings and local
government debt per capita.
   Fortune said No. 2 Atlanta rated highly because of its
appearance, low salaries and other business costs, and because it
has available land for expansion. Drawbacks included a high cost of
living and high crime rate.
   Kansas City scored for its fountains, museums, Frank Lloyd
Wright houses and midtown Country Club Plaza shopping area, as well
as good center city housing and an ample supply of technical and
professional labor.
   The rest of Fortune's top 10, in order: Los Angeles, Baltimore,
New York, California's Bay Area, Pittsburgh, Portland, Ore., and
Minneapolis-St. Paul.

<TEXT>
   Investor Saul Steinberg, one of the biggest
shareholders in UAL Corp., says he is cutting his stake to less
than 5 percent.
   In a filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
a Steinberg-controlled concern said it had sold off 499,000 shares
of UAL Class A common stock since Sept. 5 for a total of $142.8
million.
   Reliance Financial Services Corp., of which Steinberg is
chairman, said in the filing that it sold the shares in blocks
ranging in size from 9,000 to 299,000 for prices of $281.95 to
$292.90.
   The sale cut Steinberg's holdings in UAL to 1.02 million shares,
or 4.7 percent. Previously Steinberg held 6.99 percent of UAL's
shares.
   No reason for the sale was listed in the SEC filing.

   Ford Motor Co. has recalled about 70,000
1988 Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable and Lincoln Continental cars to fix
a potential power-steering problem.
   The company also extended 12-month and 12,000-mile warranty
protection of a seal in the air conditioning system to 24 months
and unlimited mileage for about 108,000 other 1988 Taurus, Sable
and Continental cars.
   Ford said Tuesday in the first action that cars with 3.8-liter
engines were being recalled for replacement of a power-steering
pump pulley. The pulleys in the cars could come off, causing a loss
of power steering and other accessories, the company said.
   In the extended warranty action, Ford said it would cover a
compressor shaft seal in air conditioning systems in cars with
3-liter engines. Failure of the seal could cause the air
conditioner to malfunction.
   Owners of affected cars who have paid for repairs caused by the
problem would be reimbursed, Ford said.

<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. says it
will make available a program that checks for viruses in personal
computers, responding in part to customer worries about an
impending attack.
   News reports about the so-called Datacrime virus, which is
programmed to attack after Oct. 12, have caused widespread alarm
even though experts say the virus is rare and a relatively small
number of personal computers will be harmed.
   ``Up until the recent press hype, our customers had not
expressed any tremendous interest over and above what we already do
in terms of security products and awareness,'' said Art Gilbert,
IBM's manager of secure systems industry support.
   Small companies in the anti-virus field expressed support for
the step Tuesday by the world's largest computer maker.
   ``It's about time one of the big boys realized what a problem
this is and did something about it. To date, all the anti-virus
activity is being done by the mom and pops out there,'' said Ross
Greenberg, a New York-based consultant and author of Flu-Shot Plus.
   ``It's a very important and responsible step,'' said Pamela
Kane, president of Panda Systems in Wilmington, Del., and author of
a new book, ``Virus Protection.''
   IBM said its IBM Virus Scanning Program for computers that run
Microsoft Corp.'s DOS base-layer software would spot three strains
of the Datacrime virus as well as more common viruses that go by
such names as the Jerusalem, Lehigh, Bouncing Ball, Cascade and
Brain.
   The program is available for $35 directly from IBM or from
dealers, marketing representatives and remarketers. Gilbert said
the program will detect but not eradicate viruses. Some other
companies say they have products that will eradicate viruses,
although others say such programs are not reliable.
   Gilbert said installing a virus checker is not a substitute for
safe-computing practices such as making backup copies of programs
and data and being cautious about software of unknown origin.
   The Datacrime virus cripples personal computers' hard disks,
where programs and data are stored, by wiping out the directory
sections known as the partition table and file allocation table.
   Experts who have dismantled copies of the virus say it is set up
to attack computers when their internal calendars go past Oct. 12,
the traditional date for Columbus Day.

<HEAD>Timberland Investments Touted as Hedge Against Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GORDON FAIRCLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Timberland is drawing increased
attention from investors who are rediscovering its value as a
relatively low-risk investment that provides a good hedge against
inflation, experts say.
   ``There is a growing interest by non-traditional investors in
timberlands _ pension funds and individuals _ who are looking at
timber as another asset to diversify their portfolios,'' said Clark
S. Binkley, a professor at Yale University's forestry and business
schools.
   ``The conventional wisdom (has been) that timber stands are
risky investments because of forest fires, insect infestations and
a volatile demand linked to fluctuations in the housing market,''
Binkley said. ``But the reality is that you can store timber on the
stump until demand goes up and only a miniscule percentage will be
lost to fires and disease.''
   Because timberland does not tend to fall prey to the same market
forces as stocks and bonds, Binkley said, it can be a useful tool
in building a diversified portfolio. Investments in timber also can
offer comparable rates of return to stocks and bonds with
considerably less risk, he said.
   Southern pine timberland, for example, has had an annual return
of about 10 percent since 1955.
   Investors are being drawn to timberland because of ``the
diversification and low risk coupled with what we consider very
good returns,'' said Robert Chambers, the Atlanta-based vice
president and manager of timberland for First Wachovia Investment
Management, a division of the First Wachovia Bank.
   Chambers said that pension funds have invested $600 million to
$700 million in timberland.
   While some pension funds, like USX Corp.'s, own thousands acres
on their own, most of these non-traditional investors join with
other investors in timberland investment funds.
   The largest fund is run by John Hancock, the Boston-based
insurance and financial services company. Other insurance
companies, including Mutual of New York, also manage timber funds,
as does First Wachovia Bank, which is based in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   First Wachovia runs the country's only open-ended fund, which
allows investors to increase or decrease the size of their
investments and allows new investors to join each quarter.
   Other funds are closed-ended, with participants investing a
fixed amount and remaining committed to the fund until a pre-set
maturation date.
   First Wachovia's fund has seven investors and owns about 33,000
acres of forest in Georgia, Florida and Mississippi, Chambers said.
   He said he expects ``substantial growth'' over the next three to
five years for timberland funds as they become more accepted by
pension fund managers.
   Binkley, a forestry professor who also has an appointment at
Yale's School of Organization and Management, has been working to
quantify the risks involved in timber investments.
   ``We need to be able to explain timberland to potential
investors in exactly the same terms as stocks, bonds and other
investments,'' he said in a recent interview.
   Binkley said his research shows that Maine timberland presents
the least risk to investors, while Southern woodland is slightly
more risky and timberland in the Pacific Northwest is the most
risky.
   Investments in Pacific Northwest timberland seem to be the most
volatile because of the federal government's controls on the sale
of timber there. Congress sets sales levels for timber in the
region every year, so lumber prices are not simply a function of
market forces, Binkley said.
   Binkley said, however, that as risk increases, so does the
potential for investment return.
   ``I'm not saying that every individual or pension fund manager
should rush to invest in timber. I am trying to provide the tools
they can use to assess whether the investment is right for them,''
he said.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Releases $75 Million to Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troubled Eastern Airlines, striving to rebuild
as a smaller carrier, has received permission to dip into $75
million held in escrow and to sell a $30 million note that it owns.
   At a hearing Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland
granted Eastern's request to use the $75 million, which came from
asset sales, to help run its operations through the end of the year.
   Miami-based Eastern, which was struck by its unions and filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early March, is selling
about $1.8 billion in jets, routes and other assets.
   In a separate action Tuesday, the Senate voted to cut off debate
on long-stalled legislation that would require creation of a
commission to investigate and recommend solutions to the Eastern
strike, which has entered its eighth month.
   David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed bankruptcy examiner for
Eastern, told Lifland he supported Eastern's request for the funds
on the grounds that it needed the cash to keep operating.
   After the $75 million is withdrawn, Eastern will have about $300
million left in escrow from which to repay its creditors or cover
operating expenses.
   The $75 million is necessary for and will be sufficient to
support Eastern's fourth-quarter operations, said Bruce Zirinsky,
an attorney for the airline. He reiterated the company's assertion
that it is exceeding the financial projections made in an operating
plan it released in April.
   In July, Eastern asked for $100 million from the escrow account
for running operations in the third quarter. Lifland agreed to the
release of $75 million at that time.
   Lifland also ruled Tuesday that Eastern could sell an unsecured
$30 million note that it acquired in 1986 from sister carrier
Continental Airlines. The note was originally issued by now-defunct
People Express Airlines, a no-frills carrier that was absorbed by
Continental.
   The judge also postponed until Dec. 15 a hearing on the unions'
request for a special trustee to be appointed to run Eastern in
place of current management. Consideration of the request by the
Eastern pilots, Machinists union members and flight attendants has
been put off several times by the judge.
   Shapiro requested that the trustee issue be postponed until he
can finish an in-depth financial investigation of Eastern,
Continental and their parent Texas Air Corp. Shapiro said he and
more than 20 associates are interviewing current and former
officers of the companies, union leaders and others.
   The examiner told the judge he expected to complete the
investigation by early December, and said his schedule has been
delayed several times by lawyers for the parties involved.
   Bruce Simon, an attorney for the pilots union, which supports
appointment of a trustee, said there was ``informal talk'' that the
investigation could take until next spring.
   Joel Zweibel, a lawyer representing the committee of Eastern's
major creditors, said that group did not believe a trustee should
be named at this time.
   Also Tuesday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it had lowered
its credit ratings on securities issued by Texas Air and
Continental, reflecting the ``high leverage, weak debt protection
and decreasing financial flexibility of the parent and its
subsidiaries.''
   The credit-rating agency said Texas Air's ability to support
Continental has been diminished by the bankruptcy of Eastern, its
other main subsidiary.

<HEAD>Automakers Expect Tighter Market in 1990</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the 1990 model year debuts, automakers are
predicting a smaller U.S. car and truck market, more players in it
and the likelihood of more buyer incentives.
   Nearly 80 million vehicles have been sold during the last five
model years in the United States, or nearly one new car or truck
for every three people in the country. There has been some concern
that the market has been saturated.
   But demand that flagged during the 1989 model year, which
officially ended Saturday, may get a boost in the 1990 model year
as the vehicles on the road get older and closer to trade-in time.
   ``A lot of pessimists love to make the statement that we seem to
be selling cars at a pretty brisk clip for eight years now and who
needs a new car?'' said analyst Charles Brady of the New York
investment firm Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.
   ``If we replace just one of three of the cars 10 years or older,
we'd sell 10 million vehicles,'' he said.
   Final sales figures, due out today, probably will show that just
under 15 million cars and trucks were sold during the 1989 model
year. Experts predict that figure won't be reached this model year.
   Bob Thomas, vice president and general manager of the Nissan
Division of Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., this week predicted 14
million vehicles will be sold this year. General Motors Corp. is on
the high side of 1990 predictions at about 15 million, a slight
change from the 1989 model year.
   Chrysler Corp. expects about 14.2 million vehicles will be sold
in the 1990 model year, while Ford Motor Co. has said the figure
will be lower than the 14.8 million it believed were driven off
dealership lots in the 1989 model year. Ford has declined to make a
formal prediction for 1990 sales.
   During the past year, about two cars were sold for every truck,
and analysts predict that ratio will remain about the same, or
perhaps lean a little heavier toward trucks.
   Like Nissan, analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New
York is forecasting 14 million cars and trucks will be sold in the
1990 model year if incentives remain constant.
   He said that without the rebates that stretched through much of
1989, automakers would have sold 1 million fewer vehicles.
   ``That would have been an 11 percent drop instead of a 5 percent
drop,'' he said, referring to the 15.8 million vehicles sold during
the 1988 model year, the third best year in auto history.
   As the size of the market shrinks, the number of models offered
continues to grow.
   In the popular minivan segment, GM is introducing a trio of
models _ its first minivans with front wheel drive _ that Chrysler
admits will dent its dominance of that market. Chrysler is striking
back in part with an upscale version of its vans.
   On the luxury end of the car market, Japanese companies are
introducing two new lines to the United States this model year.
   Nissan's Infiniti and Toyota's Lexus are marketing two cars
each, ranging in price from just over $20,000 to nearly $40,000.
Jaguar of Britain also is introducing a new car to the U.S. market,
priced lower than its others at $39,700.
   On the less-expensive end of the market, GM's Chevrolet Division
is heavily promoting its Geo line of three cars and a sport-utility
vehicle made either entirely or partly by Japanese companies.
   Chrysler's dated Omni-Horizon models will continue, but with
less marketing emphasis, while Ford will introduce its new
generation of Escort-Tracer cars in mid-1990.

<HEAD>FTC Accepts Tobacco Firm's Settlement on False Advertising Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. has settled a
federal false advertising claim by agreeing ``not to misrepresent
in future advertisements'' the results of a study that linked
smoking and heart disease.
   The Federal Trade Commission was divided 3-1 over accepting the
settlement, which was termed ``conspicuously weak'' by the
dissenter, Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga.
   She said the acceptance ``demonstrates a modicum of interest, at
most, in important issues related to smoking and health'' and
indicates a double standard for deceptive advertising and lenient
treatment for Reynolds.
   Commissioner Andrew J. Strenio Jr. defended the agreement,
calling it ``both justified and commensurately strong.'' He said it
provides ``appropriate disincentives'' against recurrence of the
allegedly unfair and deceptive claims.
   In a statement, the tobacco firm said Tuesday it remains
convinced its advertising message ``constituted an exercise of free
speech'' but that it felt there was no purpose in continuing its
fight with the FTC.
   ``We have decided therefore to accept a settlement that puts the
matter behind the company,'' R.J. Reynolds said.
   The FTC complained that a Reynolds advertisement made false and
misleading claims about a long-term study funded by the National
Institutes of Health.
   ``Reynolds' advertisement falsely claimed that (the study)
provided scientific evidence that smoking is not as hazardous as
the public has been led to believe,'' the FTC complaint said. Also,
said the FTC, the ad falsely maintained that the study ``tends to
refute the theory that smoking causes heart disease.''
   The consent agreement is not an admission that the law was
violated and it can become final, after more commission debate,
after a 60-day comment period by the public.
   Commission chairman Janet D. Steiger did not vote on the order.

   Two Texans credited with revolutionizing
electronics with their co-invention of the semiconductor microchip
were named the first winners of the Charles Stark Draper Prize, the
world's largest award given exclusively for engineering achievement.
   Jack S. Kilby, chief technical officer of the Houston Area
Research Center, and Robert N. Noyce, president of Sematech in
Austin, will share a $350,000 cash award and each will receive a
gold medal, officials announced Tuesday.
   The Draper prize, awarded for the first time this year, is
directed by the National Academy of Engineering, a private
organization affiliated with the National Academy of Sciences. The
prize will be awarded every two years.
   ``We believe that the Draper prize will focus world attention on
the important contributions of engineers in the same way that the
Nobel Prize now focuses attention on the accomplishemnts of
scientists,'' said Robert M. White, president of the National
Academy of Engineering.
   White said Kilby and Noyce are credited with the independent,
co-invention of the single crystal microchip. The microchip has led
to a revolution in electronics and has become a vital component in
machines used in communications, manufacturing, transportation and
computing.
   ``Very few things have changed the world as dramatically as the
integrated circuit,'' White said. ``Like the invention of the
telephone, the light bulb, or the automobile, the creation and
widespread practical application of the integrated circuit has
fundamentally changed our lives.''
   The microchip is used in electronic circuits that are at the
heart of such equipment as calculators, digital watches,
telephones, automatic cameras, personal computers, compact discs
and in the electronics of satellites, airplanes and military
weapons.
   Before the microchip was invented in the 1950s, electronic
circuits depended on transistors, resistors and capacitors that had
to be soldered and wired together to create a desired function.
Microchips, however, are made from a single silicon crystal and the
functions of thousands of electronic components can be built into a
chip about the size of a matchhead.
   Noyce, 62, is president and chief executive officer of Sematech,
a consortium conducting fundamental research in electronics and
computers.
   Kilby, 66, joined Texas Instruments in 1958 where he conducted
the research that led to his co-invention of the microchip. He is
now an independent consultant in Dallas and chief technical officer
for the Houston Area Research Center, a technology development
concern.
   Charles Stark Draper, for whom the engineering prize is named,
was the inventor of inertial navigation, a guidance system that
helped Apollo astronauts navigate to the moon.

<HEAD>FDA Says Generic Drug Review Results in One Recall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says its
ongoing review of the 30 top-selling generic drugs has resulted so
far in the recall of one drug.
   Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. of Denver recalled its antifungal
nystatin tablets because they were found to be below potency, the
FDA said Tuesday.
   Five other companies have recalled drugs since the FDA began
investigating allegations of fraud and corruption within its
generic drug division and among some generic drug makers. None of
the recalled has posed a major safety problem, the FDA said.
   The FDA said the Sept. 27 recall by Pharmaceutical Basics was
``the first recall'' stemming from the testing. It did not say
whether further recalls would be required.
   The FDA said it has analyzed 1,827 samples of the 30 leading
generics for potency, dissolution, composition and other
specifications, and nearly all were found to be within acceptable
specifications. About 1.6 percent of the samples were found to be
deficient in potency or dissolution, which the FDA said is about
the rate it usually finds under normal industry conditions.
   The agency said it has more testing to do, and its findings are
to be released at the end of the month.

   The Senate Finance Committee early Wednesday
defeated a proposed cut in the capital-gains tax and on a tie vote
approved a substitute saving-incentive plan that would allow all
workers to have tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts.
   Nearing final action on a bill whose main purpose is to cut the
federal deficit by about $8 billion in the fiscal year that began
Sunday, the committee formally approved a 63 percent increase in
the amount older Americans may earn without losing any of their
Social Security benefits.
   The $1-billion-a-year change would benefit only the most
affluent 10 percent of Social Security beneficiaries.
   On a 10-10 vote nearly along party lines, the committee retained
a proposal in the bill by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, to
liberalize IRAs. The same vote rejected a cut in capital-gains tax
offered by Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., along lines recommended by
President Bush. Only Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., broke party ranks,
siding with the GOP proposal.
   Packwood's amendment also included some IRA provisions, allowing
workers to contribute to an account without any immediate tax
deduction, but exempting interest from ever being taxed.
   Bentsen said that would simply shift the costs of IRAs to a
future generation. He portrayed his own plan as superior to
Packwood's and to a different capital-gains reduction approved by
the House.
   Republicans made clear they will renew the capital-gains fight
on the Senate floor as early as this week.
   Most of the spending cuts in the bill would affect Medicare
reimbursements to hospitals and doctors. One provision would save
money by overhauling the fee schedule for reimbursing doctors,
basing fees on the time, training and skill required to provide a
particular service.
   Also added to the bill, over objections of the Bush
administration, was a provision removing the Social Security
Administration from the Department of Health and Human Services and
creating it as an indepenent agency. A similar change is awaiting
final action in the House.
   The change in the Social Security earnings limitation, which the
panel had tentatively approved Monday, would benefit only the most
affluent retirees between ages 65 and 69 _ those who earn more than
$8,880 a year in retirement. That would be about one of every 10
Social Security beneficiaries in that age group.
   The committee agreed without discussion or dissent to boost the
limit to $11,700 next year and then to $14,520. On the next $5,000
of earnings _ to a total of $19,520 _ the Social Security recipient
would give up $1 in benefits for each $4 earned.
   Once earnings pass $19,520, the penalty would be $1 for each $3
earned above the limit.
   Present law requires a retiree between the ages of 65 and 69 to
give up $1 in Social Security pension for each $2 earned above the
$8,880 earnings limit. The penalty is scheduled to drop next year
to $1 for each $3 earned above the limit.
   A separate $6,480 limit affecting beneficiaries under age 65
would not be changed by the committee's proposal. Those 70 or older
could continue to earn an unlimited amount without penalty.
   The House has agreed to a more modest increase in the 65-69
earnings limit, to $9,720 next year and $10,440 in 1991.
   The Finance Committee voted to pay for the increase by requiring
that deferred compensation, such as earnings set aside in a 401(k)
retirement plan, be included in the formula that determines
``average total wages'' for Social Security purposes.
   The short-run effect is to increase the amount of wages subject
to Social Security taxes. In the long run, the change would cost
the government more than it brings in, by forcing up Social
Security benefits.
   The committee added to the bill a requirement that, starting in
1995, the government each year send a statement of Social Security
benefits earned sto every person 60 and older. Starting in 1999,
statements would have to be mailed to every worker.

<HEAD>McCaw Buying Half-Interest In NYC Cellular, Selling Southern Properties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After pounding for three months on LIN
Broadcasting Corp.'s front door, McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.
is trying a side entrance in its takeover attempt.
   McCaw said Tuesday it would acquire a half-interest in a New
York City cellular franchise whose other half is owned by LIN
Broadcasting.
   At the same time, McCaw said it would sell its interests in 13
mobile-telephone franchises in Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee to
Contel Cellular Inc.
   McCaw, the nation's largest cellular telephone company, said in
a statement that the New York deal involves an agreement to pay
$1.9 billion in cash for Metromedia Co.'s one-half interest in
Metro One, one of two New York cellular franchises. LIN, which owns
the other half, would have a 45-day right of first refusal to the
deal.
   The Metromedia deal would give McCaw a 50 percent voting
interest and 45.67 percent equity interest in the New York
franchise.
   LIN holds a 50 percent voting interest and 45 percent equity
interest in the franchise, which would be controlled entirely by
McCaw if its proposed acquisition of LIN goes through.
   ``It's a pretty savvy move by McCaw,'' said John Reddan, a stock
analyst for Moran &amp; Associates in New York. ``McCaw is basically
challenging LIN to either put up or shut up in New York.''
   The most immediate question for LIN officials would be whether
they wanted to borrow $1.9 billion to buy out Metro One. Taking on
the additional debt could make LIN less attractive in its own
efforts to merge with BellSouth Corp. in a 50-50 partnership,
analysts said.
   In June, McCaw offered to buy LIN for $5.85 billion. LIN
rejected that offer, but McCaw persisted, and dropped its offer
from $127 per share to $110 per share after a court decision in
July against LIN, which had claimed it owned key cellular franchise
rights in Philadelphia and New York Ciy.
   The $110-a-share offer for approximately 53 million LIN shares
has been extended to Oct. 13 despite LIN's September announcement
that it intended to merge with BellSouth.
   McCaw, LIN's largest shareholder with a 10 percent stake, has
been tendered more than 8 million LIN shares, said Tom Campo at
Adams &amp; Rinehart Inc., a New York public relations agency
representing McCaw.
   The Contel agreement would provide McCaw about $1.3 billion in
cash, or about $205 a ``pop,'' an industry yardstick obtained by
multiplying a market area population by the percentage ownership of
cellular systems serving the market.
   Each market is allowed two cellular franchises, one for the
local telephone company and one for an independent operation like
McCaw.
   The Contel agreement, which is subject to closing price
adjustments, would make the Contel Corp. subsidiary the nation's
seventh-largest cellular phone company, gaining controlling
cellular interests in 13 Southeastern markets, including Louisville
and Lexington, Ky.; Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Johnson City,
Chattanooga and Clarksville, Tenn.; and Birmingham, Tuscaloosa,
Florence, Anniston and Gadsden, Ala.
   The Metromedia deal covers about 6.8 million pops, and works out
to about $275 a pop. The Contel deal is about 6.1 million pops.
Atlanta-based Contel currently has about 14.4 million pops.
   These are ``two more steps toward achieving our longstanding
strategic objective of creating a national cellular network that
will give American consumers an independent alternative to
traditional providers of telephone service,'' McCaw Chairman Craig
O. McCaw said.
   He described Contel as ``a fellow independent with whom we have
had a long and mutually beneficial relationship.''
   McCaw, based in this Seattle suburb, operates in 127 areas with
a total of 50 million pops in 26 states, including major regional
systems along the West Coast and in the Rocky Mountains, Northeast,
Florida and Texas.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union representing 57,000 Boeing Co.
employees went on strike early Wednesday in its first strike
against the world's largest aerospace company in 12 years.
   Machinist union members in Seattle, Portland, Ore., Wichita,
Kan., and elsewhere began the walkout at 12:01 a.m. local time,
union officials said.
   In Seattle on Tuesday, the union overwhelmingly rejected what
Boeing said would be its final contract offer.
   Union leaders had said they would notify a federal mediator, who
joined negotiations last weekend, that they would be willing to
consider resuming negotiations.
   But Tom Baker, president of the Machinists' District Lodge 751,
said the union would not be in favor of extending the midnight
strike deadline.
   Boeing issued a statement several hours after the strike vote,
expressing disappointment but vowing to continue operations with
supervisors and non-striking workers.
   ``Our airline customers have been notified of a strike and our
intention to support deliveries to the best of our ability,''
Boeing said. ``It is impossible to make a general statement on all
defense and space programs since they are at various stages of
development and production.''
   Union leaders said the members were unified and determined to
get a better share of Boeing's recent success.
   ``I'm pleased that the rank and file are as solid as they are
and as united as they are on the issues,'' said Baker, adding the
union would take a dim view of extending the strike deadline.
   Baker said the main reason for the strike vote was a feeling
that Boeing workers deserved a greater share of the company's
record prosperity.
   ``We have gone through the hard times with this company. We just
want to go through the good times with them as well as the hard
times,'' Baker said.
   Baker left a brief news conference with reporters to go to union
headquarters where he said he would attend a briefing for picket
captains.
   The rejected offer for the machinists promised an immediate
raise of 4 percent with 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991.
   The proposed three-year contract also contained annual bonuses
of 8 percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent
the next, insurance improvements and reduced compulsory overtime
requirements.
   Workers filling more than half of the 65,000-seat Kingdome
jeered the proposed contract and folded summaries of it into paper
airplanes which filled the air of the indoor stadium throughout a
loud meeting.

   ``We would certainly have to have more,'' Baker told reporters
earlier as the machinists filed toward the podium to vote. ``We
have told the Boeing Co. what it would take to settle the
contract.''
   Boeing's stock rose $3.12{ to $59.75 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading Tuesday, apparently on expectations that the
contract would be ratified.
   Boeing machinists voting in Seattle, Wichita, Kan., Portland,
Ore., and elsewhere were asked to decide whether to accept the
contract, which required a simple majority, and whether to strike,
which required approval by two-thirds of those voting.
   The union previously authorized a strike at midnight Tuesday,
the same time its three-year contract with Boeing expires.
   Baker said he expected the eventual settlement to set a pattern
for labor talks throughout the aerospace industry.
   Judith Comeau, an aerospace industry analyst for Goldman, Sachs
&amp; Co. in New York, said a strike would not be ``a big issue,
provided it doesn't go much longer than two weeks.
   ``Financially the company is very strong with $3.2 billion in
cash, $5 billion in equity and $200 million in debts. The impact of
a strike probably won't even be measurable,'' Comeau said.
   ``It won't make customers happy because there's already been
some delays in deliveries, especially 747s. Quite simply, they're
just going to have to wait,'' she said.
   Union leaders told the machinists, who last struck Boeing in
1977 for two months, the time was right to demand more.
   ``If you aren't tough enough to secure a decent contract this
time you'll never get one,'' said Justin Ostro, general union vice
president and bargaining coordinator.
   ``If you turn tail and run, don't come back in three years''
expecting great change, he added. ``There is no good time to
strike. There is only the right time.''
   Boeing, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, is
enjoying its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders, with
carriers and leasing companies ordering 736 planes worth $38.5
billion so far this year.
   Though Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business, Boeing
Commercial Airplanes has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth about
$70 billion and deliveries extending well into the mid-1990s.
   For 1988, profits were $614 million on $16.96 billion in sales.
   Baker said a strike could last ``a week. It could be months.''
   He said there was some division among Boeing workers about the
bonuses, with veteran employees content to see all compensation in
their paychecks and newer workers preferring the extra check at the
end of the year.
   The proposed contract also includes a cost-of-living adjustment
that is 99 percent of actual inflation, which is 17 cents per hour
better than the present formula.
   Worldwide, Boeing employs 144,725 people, including 106,000 in
western Washington.

<TEXT>
   The Fair Trade Commission has raided Apple
Computer's major authorized dealers to investigate allegations that
they pressured magazines to drop advertisements for discount stores
selling Apple products, officials said Wednesday.
   On Tuesday, the FTC raided almost 40 sites, including seven
offices of Canon Sales Co. Inc. and Apple Computer Japan, Japanese
headquarters of the California-based Apple Computer Inc., said
Mitsuru Suzuki, an FTC investigator.
   Canon and Apple Computer denied the allegations.
   An official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the FTC could warn, but
not punish, any companies found to have applied such pressure.
   Suzuki said one non-authorized retailer of Apple products had
filed a complaint accusing Canon and Apple Computer Japan of
pressuring some major computer magazines not to publish such
retailers' ads featuring discounted Apple computers.
   ``It's sabotage to free business activities,'' Suzuki said,
``and we suspect Apple might have been cooperating in the action,
which prevents equal opportunity for other competitors.''
   Among the popular Apple products involved are desk-top computers
such as Macintosh Plus and Macintosh SE, printers including Image
Writer II, hard discs and external drives for added memory capacity.
   Akisuke Fukutomi, an executive of Step, one of about 10
individual importers of Macintosh computers, told The Associated
Press that he filed the complaint with the FTC.
   ``Our company is the victim,'' he said.
   He said ``Mac Life,'' a major computer magazine published by
Kawade Shobo and featuring Apple products, carried one
advertisement by Step in April but then stopped.
   The magazine's editor apologized, explaining that Canon and
Apple pressured the magazine, he said.
   The editor could not be reached for comment.
   ``We should be given equal opportunity so that everybody can
compete on the same ground,'' Fukutomi said.
   ``We have no fancy showrooms, nor do we have beautiful
brochures. But our low pricing is reasonable, and what's wrong with
that?'' he said.
   For example, a 4-mega-bite Macintosh SE with Japanese language
capability costs $6,030 through any of the 20 authorized agents,
whereas Step sells it for $4,200, he said.
   Since June, another major monthly magazine, ASCII, has left
blank spaces in Step's ads where there used to be prices.
   Step also carries NEC, Epson and Toshiba computers, Fukutomi
said, adding that it sells some 110 Macs a month.
   Canon Sales Co. was the sole agent for Apple computers in Japan
until Apple's subsidiary was establisheed in 1983. Canon does not
import Apple computers, but distributes 80 percent to 90 percent of
Apple Computers in Japan to about 240 retail stores, said Motoyuki
Fujimoto, a Canon spokesman.
   ``We are innocent, and there is no evidence to merit such
suspicion,'' he said.
   Takashi Fujimura, Canon's managing director, said in a
statement, ``We're in a position to help the FTC investigate, as
well as conducting our own investigation internally.''
   The FTC also accused Apple Computer Japan of refusing to repair
Apple products brought in by customers who had bought them from
non-authorized retailers.
   Apple Computer spokeswoman Keiko Fukushima said the company had
no intention to prevent fair competition.
   ``The reason we cannot fix the machines is that many of the
computers purchased through non-authorized dealers do not have
serial numbers, which is the most important identification of Apple
products for repair,'' she said.
   While some individual importers have been reported erasing
serial numbers to avoid tracing and interference with their supply
sources, Step's Fukutomi said his stores has been using the serial
numbers since Sept. 1, ending the repair problem.

<HEAD>Harley Vows to Stay Independent Despite Possible Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harley-Davidson Inc., the only remaining U.S.
motorcycle manufacturer, says it plans to stay independent despite
a possible takeover bid from an investor group holding a 6.24
percent stake in the company.
   Richard F. Teerlink, Harley's chief executive officer, said the
group headed by businessman Malcolm I. Glazer has had no contact
with the company.
   ``I don't know him or his intent,'' Teerlink said of Glazer in a
statement.
   However, Teerlink said Harley management, which repurchased the
company from AMF Inc. in 1981 and later took it public, wanted to
remain independent. Harley is the last remaining U.S. manufacturer
of motorcycles.
   In a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Glazer said he had purchased 488,200 shares, or 5.7 percent of
Harley's common stock. The filing said Glazer's six children each
controlled 8,500 shares of Harley for a family total of 6.24
percent.
   Glazer, of Rochester, N.Y., is chairman of First Allied Corp.,
which he said has interests in more than 30 companies in 12 states
with assets of more than $200 million.
   ``We invest in companies which we feel are significantly
undervalued, are leaders in their field, have strong brand name
recognition and exhibit tremendous future growth potential,''
Glazer said, adding that Harley had those qualifications.
   Teerlink confirmed that management controls a 10 percent stake
in the company, and he said Harley's anti-takeover measures include
a ``poison pill'' shareholder rights plan.
   When asked if the company would do anything differently to
increase the value of its stock, he replied, ``We think the way we
run the business enhances shareholder value well with a longterm
view.''
   Teerlink said he spoke Tuesday to Harris Associates of Chicago,
Harley's largest stockholder with a 12.9 percent interest, but he
declined to comment on what was discussed.
   Harley stock rose $3.62{ to $42.75 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading Tuesday.
   Harley is best known for its heavyweight motorcycles built for
highway travel and favored by many law enforcement agencies.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices slipped at midday Wednesday as an
initial surge was turned back by nervousness over the pound.
   At 12:15 p.m. local time, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 3.8 points at 2,314.9, off its early surge
of 2,331.1.
   Midday volume totaled 316.5 million shares, compared with 338.1
million the same time Tuesday.
   Dealers said shares were buoyed early by Wall Street's strength
on Tuesday, but jitters over the outlook for sterling got the upper
hand.
   Sterling fell against the West German mark, raising concerns
that the government would push up interest rates to support the
pound.
   The market is awaiting the outcome of Thursday's meeting of the
Deutsche Bundesbank central bank council.
   Many traders are expecting a half-point hike in key West German
interest rates to come out of the meeting, although some analysts
said such a move already was fully discounted by the market.

<HEAD>Unisys Begins Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. said it hopes to see savings
in the fourth quarter from a restructuring plan that will reduce
the work force by 8,000 and annual costs by more than $400 million.
   The cost-cutting moves, originally announced Aug. 18 and begun
this week, are designed to counter weak domestic demand for
computers and defense electronics products and stiffer worldwide
competition.
   Unisys said Tuesday it plans to cut roughly 1,000 more jobs than
originally expected when it first announced the restructuring.
   The austerity measures involve laying off 6,300 people and
eliminating 1,700 positions through attrition and early retirement.
That will reduce the work force by nearly 10 percent to about
80,000 worldwide, the company said.
   W. Michael Blumenthal, Unisys chairman and chief executive
officer, said the restructuring plan was the result of months of
planning.
   ``The actions being announced today will reduce our costs in
1990 significantly, and along with other planned improvements, this
will lead to a substantial lowering of our break-even point,'' he
said Tuesday.
   ``By simplifying our organizational structure and shortening
lines of communication, we will be better able to meet our
customer's needs.''
   Blumenthal said the cost of restructuring would be announced
later this month with the third-quarter financial results. The
company said it expects to take a substantial charge in the third
quarter.
   Unisys has been losing ground in the mainframe and minicomputer
markets lately. In addition, its big defense business has lagged
partly due to slowing growth in the U.S. defense budget and also
because of a three-month suspension in its dealings with the
government tied to the company's involvement in the Pentagon
procurement scandal.
   Unisys is cutting jobs throughout the company, including on the
corporate level, according to Unisys spokesman J. Peter Hynes.
   This week, the company plans to eliminate 3,200 jobs at 250
sites in the United States. An additional 1,200 jobs outside the
United States will be cut by the first quarter of 1990. Unisys, the
nation's No. 3 computer company, will continue cutting 1,900 jobs
later this year and into 1990.
   In addition to layoffs, the plan involves eliminating overhead
and consolidating administrative and technical support functions,
reducing manufacturing overseas and increasing the move toward
in-house production of the company's major microprocessor lines.
   The company said it expects the program to lower the company's
break-even point by more than $1.5 billion, meaning that if it were
to break even on roughly $10 billion of sales it expects to post
for this year, it would be able to break even on $8.5 billion of
sales in 1990.
   Last quarter, the company reported a 67 percent decrease in
earnings, blaming a drop in inventory, pricing pressure from
competitors and a temporary suspension of Pentagon work.
   Hynes said the company's consolidation plans include
transferring the manufacture of computer mainframes from Tredyffrin
to Clear Lake, Iowa, by mid-1990. Unisys will close its St.
Laurent, Canada, plant in 1990 and shift its engineering support to
Rancho Bernardo, Calif.
   Most of the manufacturing at the Unisys Peripherals Group in
Santa Clara, Calif., hardest hit with 350 job cuts, will be
consolidated into other facilities.
   In addition, Hynes said Unisys is implementing a new plan to
strengthen its approach to selected markets and to reallocate
support services. The original plan was adopted in 1986 when Sperry
Corp. and Burroughs Corp. merged.

<HEAD>Executive Predicts Braniff Will Survive as Smaller Airline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deregulation has hurt smaller, independent
airlines while favoring larger carriers, a top executive of Braniff
Inc. told aviation executives as his cash-starved airline tries to
rebuild as a smaller carrier.
   Tom Volz, Braniff's senior vice president for marketing, blamed
the carrier's troubles on the government's 1978 deregulation of the
nation's airline industry. Braniff, based in Orlando, filed last
week for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and protection from
creditors _ its second such filing in seven years.
   Frequent-flier tickets are a particular source of unfair
competition, Volz told about 300 aviation executives attending the
Transport Aircraft Marketing Symposium in Orlando Tuesday.
   Although he said he doesn't favor a return to tight regulation
of the industry, Volz suggested that the government should consider
ordering an end to frequent-flier programs, which he said allow
unfair competition.
   Because of its smaller size, Braniff's frequent-flier program
was not started until after those of the larger airlines, Volz
said, and wasn't able to catch up.
   Volz said small airlines such as Braniff also were damaged by
travel agents he described as being ``locked in'' by the suppliers
of their computerized reservation systems. Those systems, he noted,
either are owned outright _ or jointly _ by the big airlines.
   Between 1978 and 1988, he said, the number of U.S. airlines
dropped from 36 to 28, while the carriers' combined profit fell to
$600 million from $1 billion, and 200 airlines filed for bankruptcy
or halted operations.
   Although Braniff has run out of cash, it hopes to remain aloft
as a smaller airline with hubs in Orlando and Kansas City, Mo., and
reduced service to ``spoke'' cities, Volz said.
   Kansas City will remain the airline's primary hub because of its
central location, Volz said, and Orlando will continue as a hub
because it is one of the fastest-growing areas in the nation.
   Passengers from feeder, or spoke, cities will be flown to the
hubs to catch connecting flights.
   A new Braniff marketing program will start within two weeks,
emphasizing ``a smaller, independent airline with a lower price
range,'' Volz said. ``We'll have to be a boutique airline, offering
more for less.''
   Braniff resumed service this past weekend after halting nearly
all flights last Wednesday, the day before its bankruptcy filing.
The airline announced Tuesday that it operated all 46 scheduled
departures in 11 cities nationwide.
   Braniff also said it will continue to offer $99 one-way bargain
fares to all destinations through Oct. 31. The airline was
``booking up heavily under this deep discount offer,'' Volz said.
   About 2,000 employees out of Braniff's pre-strike workforce of
4,800 were on duty Tuesday. The company's Orlando workforce dropped
from 1,000 to 275.
   In 1982, Braniff filed for bankruptcy reorganization in Dallas,
where it was based at the time. The airline emerged from Chapter 11
protection in 1986.

   More than 57,000 Machinists in at least seven
states struck Boeing Co. today, demanding a bigger share of its
record prosperity and threatening production delays at the world's
biggest aerospace company.
   The union members, including 43,300 in the Seattle area, took to

   At Boeing Military Airplanes in Wichita, Kan., the
second-largest concentration of union members, pickets let
non-strikers' cars through one at a time after sometimes heated
exchanges. Traffic was backed up about a mile.
   The wife of a picket who jumped onto a car entering the plant
fell and suffered bruises, a sheriff's spokeswoman said.
   In Seattle, pickets shivered in 45-degree weather outside Boeing
headquarters.
   ``People are willing to picket, willing to do whatever it
takes,'' said picket Brian McTighe. ``The attitude seems to be
militant.''
   No new talks have been announced.
   The strike hits a company struggling to meet delivery schedules
in the midst of its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner
orders.
   ``We have gone through the hard times with this company,'' said
Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751. ``We just
want to go through the good times with them as well as the hard
times.''
   The Machinists voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to reject a
three-year contract offer. The union represents the bulk of the
company's production workers, who perform tasks ranging from
riveting, wiring and plumbing in aircraft to quality inspections
and machine-tool maintenance.
   The Machinists last struck Boeing in 1977, for two months.
   Airlines and leasing companies striving to replace their aging
fleets and meet a surge in passenger traffic have ordered 736
planes worth $38.5 billion so far this year. Though Pentagon
cutbacks have reduced military business, Boeing's commercial
division has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth about $70
billion, with deliveries extending into the mid-1990s.
   The backlog has caused embarrassing delays in deliveries of the
new 747-400 jumbo jet, Boeing's first in two decades, and forced
workers to put in heavy overtime.
   ``We're working on airplanes,'' said Dave Branson, a worker
outside the Everett plant. ``We shouldn't be working fatigued. They
push for quantity, not quality.''
   Boeing promised to meet delivery schedules ``to the best of our
ability.'' Spokesman Paul Binder said the company was trying to
find supervisors to work assembly lines and keep jets rolling out.
He said there were no plans to bring in outsiders.
   ``This is a negotiating position,'' Binder said of the company's
latest offer. ``It's not a take-it-or-leave-it.'' He refused to
comment further on the company's reaction to the walkout.
   Union spokesman Jack Daniels said it would take two to three
weeks to shut down operations completely because supervisors could
finish some nearly completed planes with parts on hand.
   A shutdown could worsen the U.S. trade deficit. Boeing is the
country's largest exporter.
   Baker said union members were determined to get a better share
of Boeing's record prosperity. The company earned $614 million last
year on sales of $16.96 billion. Boeing also holds $3.66 billion in
cash and short-term notes.
   The company's three-year offer included an immediate 4 percent
raise with 3 percent raises in 1990 and 1991, plus annual bonuses
of 8 percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent
the next.
   Workers haven't had an increase in base wages _ which determine
pensions and other benefits _ for six years, although Boeing paid
bonuses of 12 percent in 1986 and 5 percent in 1987 and 1988.
   The proposal also would have reduced compulsory overtime from
200 hours a quarter to 160 hours and boosted some benefits and the
cost-of-living adjustment.
   For the average Machinist making $13.39 per hour, the offer
would have given an additional $13,800 in income over the next
three years.
   Workers filling more than half of the 65,000-seat Kingdome
jeered the offer Tuesday and folded summaries of it into paper
airplanes that sailed down from the second and third tiers of the
indoor stadium.
   ``If you aren't tough enough to secure a decent contract this
time you'll never get one,'' Justin Ostro, general union vice
president and bargaining coordinator, told the crowd.
   Worldwide, Boeing employs 144,725 people, including 106,000 in
western Washington. In addition to the Seattle workers, the
Machinists represent 12,000 employees in Wichita, about 1,700
workers in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred others in California,
Hawaii, Montana, Utah and some other states.
   Baker said $100 million is available in a strike fund from the
parent union, which has been on strike against Eastern Airlines
since March. Strike pay is a flat $100 a week per union member, he
added.

<HEAD>Poverty Politics Misses The Mark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>

   In politics, one of the safest, popular,
commendable and perhaps rewarding stances is to be for the poor,
especially through government transfer programs.
  tific director since
1985. ``Many of the things that we used to blame on age ... are
indeed modifiable (by lifestyle) and probably add to the life
expectancy and add to the quality of life of people.''
   The BLSA, a component of the National Institute on Aging in the
National Institutes of Health, was founded in 1958 by Dr. Nathan W.
Shock, regarded as the founder of modern research on aging. He
started the first NIH section on gerontology in 1941 at Baltimore
City Hospital.
   ``Dr. Shock wanted to measure such things as the rate of
aging,'' said Fozard. ``As it turns out, this hope sort of
disintegrated and was replaced by a number of more specific
questions.''
   BLSA researchers have studied aging's effects on more than 1,800
people, who are given physical examinations. Tests are done each
visit on all of the organ systems, the condition of the blood,
muscles, bones, hearing and vision. Electrocardiograms and tests
using radiation are given less frequently.
   Volunteers also are tested on their memory, reasoning and
problem-solving abilities, intelligence and personality, a history
of each person's aging that is used in more than 50 studies under
way as part of the overall project.
   Among the findings is that ``there is no single biological
master clock which drives all of the physiological aging that we
see,'' Fozard said.
   Volunteers pay their own way to Baltimore and spend more than
two days every 2{ years undergoing as many as 103 medical and
behavioral tests. ``I know of no other study that makes that kind
of demand,'' he said. ``We ask them for a lifetime'' of commitment,
and many agree to be autopsied after they die.
   The study pays for lodging and meals while volunteers are here,
as well as for the tests, which could total $4,000 at a doctor's
office or hospital.
   The volunteers range in age from 20 to 97. Sixty-five percent
are men, 70 percent are college educated, and half of those have
advanced degrees. Most are middle- or upper-middle-class and only 5
percent are black.
   ``In some of the studies the social class definitely makes a
difference,'' Fozard said. ``In that sense, the study may not be as
representative'' as one with a more varied sample. But ``when you
compare all types of biological results, these things don't vary
much on social class.''
   Scientists who use data from the BLSA say the racial and social
structure of the study is one of its weaknesses.
   ``In an ideal world, we'd have it truly representative of all
groups in the United States,'' said Dr. Hugh Taylor at the Wilmer
Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins Hospital. ``But you have to be
realistic. There is a variety of people there and everybody is
going to die. Everybody gets old.''
   Researchers say the study's history explains its sociological
profile.
   The first subject, Dr. William Wesley Peter, recruited
participants from among family and friends, a practice that
continues among volunteers today.
   The study has a waiting list of about 1,000 people, and
researchers have not made an effort to broaden its base, Fozard
said.
   Paul Kirby's grandfather volunteered shortly after the study
began. Since then, Kirby, 40, of Glenwood, Md., his father, brother
and three sisters became involved. His wife, Pamela, and a sister's
husband also have volunteered.
   The involvement of nine members of a single family could help
the BLSA determine whether heredity determines aging, Kirby said.
``If they can see a trend in different generations of a family,
they might find a genetic link.''
   That genetic link still has scientists baffled, Fozard said.
``We are constantly looking for ways to measure to get a handle on
the genetic component of aging. We think there are only a few genes
involved with aging, but where they are and what they are is still
a mystery.''
   Kenneth J. Nicholson, 86, of Mesa, Ariz., joined the study in
1960. He recently completed his 13th checkup for the study, which
he said has ``made me more cognizant of aging and the aging
population.''
   Nicholson said he also has modified his diet and made other
changes in his lifestyle as a result of information gleaned during
his visit.
   Information on any medical problem detected is given to the
volunteers, and their family physicians are notified so treatment
can be prescribed.
   ``The longer I have cooperated, the more they are providing
information to us,'' Nicholson said. ``They give me good advice and
that is very helpful.''
   Fifteen scientists work with the BLSA full-time, Fozard said. As
many as 10 other scientists collaborate periodically through
agreements with universities around the country. The study has an
annual budget of about $3 million.
   Volunteers say the BLSA's impact on society is enormous.
   ``The longer it can run, the more value they will get out of
it,'' said Nicholson. ``I would certainly hate to see it stopped.''

   The $50 billion Congress earmarked two months
ago to rescue failed savings institutions may not be enough,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman said
today.
   ``It is possible that $50 billion will prove to be an
insufficient amount to deal with potential failures,'' Seidman said
in written testimony presented to the Senate Banking Committee.
   ``But it is really much too early to make a reliable new
prediction of loss,'' he added at the first hearing on the savings
and loan bailout since Congress passed the legislation Aug. 9.
   Also testifying were Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady,
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing Secretary Jack
Kemp, who are members of the oversight board setting policy for the
Resolution Trust Corp., created to close and sell failed thrifts.
   Seidman, whose agency operates the RTC, said the government has
taken control of 283 failed S&amp;Ls with $112 billion in assets. Of
the 283, it has closed 24 small institutions and expects to sell
five large institutions by next week.
   Through August 1992, thrift regulators may turn over another 300
S&amp;Ls to the RTC, bringing the total failures to nearly 600 with
combined assets exceeding $300 billion, he said.
   Those projections ``raise questions about the adequacy of the
$50 billion in RTC funding,'' Seidman said.
   His written comments throw the strongest doubt yet on whether
one installment on the S&amp;L bailout will be enough. However, in his
oral presentation to the committee, Seidman changed his tone
slightly, saying, ``At this point we have no basis with which to
make a different estimate from the ($50 billion) one you've heard.''
   Private analysts have been saying for months that $50 billion
would amount only to a substantial down payment on resolving the
S&amp;L mess. Both Brady and Greenspan told the committee it is too
soon to know if the $50 billion is enough.
   ``I think (it) isn't the point. Maybe we need 52, maybe we need
48. THe point is we've taken a bonfire and tamped it down to the
point where it's embers,'' Brady said.
   Meanwhile, both Seidman and Brady, who heads a cabinet-level
oversight board setting policy for the RTC, reassured lawmakers
they are working to prevent any scandal in the S&amp;L bailout.
   ``Let us assure you that the oversight board is as anxious as
this committee to protect against conflicts of interest, political
favoritism and other improper actions by employees, agents,
independent contractors and all others who perform services for
both the oversight board and the RTC,'' Brady said.
   Members of Congress alarmed by the scandal at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development are trying to prevent similar abuses
from developing at the RTC.
   ``The potential problems at the RTC dwarf the substantial
problems the (Housing) secretary has thus far encountered at HUD,''
said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee.
   The RTC last week issued an interim ethics code governing the
thousands of independent contractors it is expected to hire to
manage the real estate and other assets it is inheriting from the
thrifts.
   So far, the RTC has spent $20 billion: $1.8 billion to close the
24 small S&amp;Ls, $8.3 billion to handle five large institutions by
next week and five smaller not-yet-completed deals, $8.5 billion to
replace high-cost deposits and $1.4 billion as a reserve fund to
handle liquidity problems at thrifts that have failed but are still
open, Seidman said.
   Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson said inability to close
the five big cases by Sept. 30, the last day of fiscal 1989, means
the reported federal budget deficit will be $8 billion higher in
fiscal 1990. However, he said that would not trigger automatic
spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. The 1990 budget estimate
taken for determining those cuts was made on Aug. 15, he said.
   Members of Congress also are looking at the division of the
RTC's management, in which Brady's board sets its policy and
Seidman's agency does the work.
   ``No joint enterprise of any magnitude is without its healthy
frictions, and ours is no exception,'' Brady said. ``But overall we
have gotten off to an excellent start.''
   Meanwhile, the oversight board announced Tuesday that it has
appointed Daniel P. Kearney, a Boston pension fund adviser and
mortgage-backed securities expert, as its chief staff officer with
the title of president.
   Kearney replaces Robson, who was filling the oversight board
post on an interim basis.

<HEAD>Farmers Like `Shoebox' Bookkeeping: Survey</HEAD>
<HEAD>Also moved for PMs. Also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers may be innovative in their crop and
livestock management, but many cling to the old shoebox method when
it comes to bookkeeping, an annual survey by the Agriculture
Department has found.
   Fewer than 3 percent of U.S. farmers use computers to keep
financial records, while 56 percent use general ledgers or
notebooks. About 16 percent use some kind of financial records
workbook.
   Diane Willimack of the department's National Agricultural
Statistics Service said that leaves 25 percent who use ``other
methods'' of keeping records, including 14 percent who use the
proverbial shoebox or similar way of hanging onto receipts,
invoices and bills of sale.
   Although USDA, county agents and private farm management experts
have preached for years about ``the business of farming'' and how
accurate records should be kept, relatively few of the nation's 2.2
million farms have entered the computer age.
   Statistician Willimack based her study on her agency's annual
Farm Costs and Returns Survey for calendar year 1987.
   ``Previously, there had been little documentation of farmers'
actual recordkeeping practices, although much has been written
about how farmers should keep financial records for tax or
management purposes,'' she said.
   Willimack's study was reported in the current issue of Farmline
magazine.
   Some other findings:
   _ Fewer than 12 percent of farmers subscribe to financial
recordkeeping services. Most of those used are provided by
accountants.
   _ Computer usage is not uniform among farmers. Nearly 15 percent
of large farms, those with annual sales of at least $250,000, used
computers, and nearly 40 percent of those used recordkeeping
services.
   _ Use of farm record workbooks was most popular in the Midwest,
with 20 percent to 30 percent of the farmers in the Corn Belt,
Northern Plains and Lake regions using them. The Extension Service
accounted for about 25 percent of the workbooks, and the Farmers
Home Administration 11 percent.
   _ Computer use was greatest in the Pacific region, where they
were used on 4.6 percent of the farms.
   ``This was probably due to the prominence of corporate farms,
and the larger size and greater complexity of farms in this area,''
Willimack said.
   _ One-third of all corporations used a recordkeeping service,
possibly their own paid bookkeepers.
   Willimack said the consistency of general ledger use by 50
percent to 60 percent of U.S. farm operators seemed to suggest that
records are kept primarily for tax purposes, rather than as aids
for making managerial decisions.
   ``Participants in government programs apparently keep more
complete financial records than non-participants,'' she said.
   Also, Willimack noted the use of more advanced recordkeeping by
younger, better educated farm and ranch operators indicates they
adopt such practices as they gain the ability or perceive the need
to use them.
   ``It appears that farm operators are moving up the learning
curve with regard to recordkeeping practices, but there is still
ample room for improvement,'' she said.

   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has bought 2 million metric tons of U.S. corn, the first for
delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement.
   Rumors had been circulating in the grain trade that the Soviets
were in the market for a large order of U.S. corn. The seventh year
of the long-term agreement between the two countries began Oct. 1.
   Officials said U.S. grain sales to Moscow in 1988-89, the sixth
year of the agreement were a record of more than 21.7 million tons,
including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4
million tons of wheat.
   In addition, 1988-89 sales included 442,500 tons of soybeans,
1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 2 million tons of
corn would be about 78.8 million bushels.
   The sales were made by unidentified private exporting companies,
which are required by law to report large sales to the department.
No selling prices or further details were released.
   Arthur K. Homann of the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service said it was the Soviet Union's largest single order of U.S.
corn in at least three years, although there were several orders of
more than 1 million each last year.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.22 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA's five-day average, meaning that the
latest sale could have a farm value of about $175 million.
   The agreement was extended last year until Dec. 31, 1990.
Meanwhile, the United States and the Soviet Union are preparing to
begin preliminary talks in Moscow on Dec. 4 for a new long-term
agreement.
   Under the current agreement, the Soviets are committed to buy at
least 9 million tons of grain annually, including a minimum of 4
million tons each of wheat and corn, and 1 million tons that can be
wheat, corn, soybeans and soybean meal, or any combination of those
commodities.
   The pact also allows Moscow to buy up to 3 million tons of
additional wheat and corn annually without further discussions. If
more than 12 million tons are wanted, however, the United States
must be consulted.

   Cadence Design Systems Inc. has agreed
to buy Gateway Design Automation Corp. of Lowell, Mass., in a stock
exchange valued at more than $72 million.
   San Jose-based Cadence, a growing supplier of software for the
design of integrated circuits, reported sales of $67.1 million last
year.
   Gateway has specialized in software for the simulation of
circuits and testing of electronic designs. Cadence had earlier
this year entered a cooperative marketing agreement with Gateway
and had offered Gateway's simulation software as part of its
overall line of products for electronic design.
   Cadence said Gateway will operate as a division under Prabhu
Goel, Gateway's founder, president and chief executive. Goel will
also serve on the board.
   Cadence said it will issue 4 million shares of stock to buy
Gateway. The merger will increase Cadene's workforce from 750 to
about 900 people. Cadence said it hopes to complete the
consolidation by year's end.
   The merger must still be approved by regulatory agencies and
Gateway stockholders.

<UNK>World Coffee Price Hits 14-Year Low</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee prices plunged to 14-year lows on Wednesday
after an official expressed pessimism about efforts to restore
export quotas.
   On the London market, coffee for January delivery fell by $81.60
from Tuesday's close to $1,062.40 a metric ton, recovering later to
finish the day at $1,088.
   The International Coffee Organization's latest indicator of the
average price of coffee traded throughout the world, released
Wednesday, was 64.31 cents a pound, a level last seen in 1975.
   After accounting for inflation, the price of coffee in real
terms is now at its most depressed level since the 1920s, analysts
said.
   The latest price fall started Tuesday when Jorio Duaster,
Brazil's chief coffee executive, said there was no chance of an
early return of the International Coffee Organization's export
quota system to keep excess world production off the market.
   His remarks while attending a London meeting of the organization
on the problem appeared to dash hopes of early international action
to lift and stabilize the market.

   The stock market gained more ground today,
following through on Tuesday's upsurge to record highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 40.84 points on
Tuesday, rose another 18.24 to 2,772.80 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 820 up, 624 down and
507 unchanged.
   Analysts noted some ``catch-up'' buying by investors who were
caught off guard by the market's revived rally this week.
   The new advance in stock prices was attributed in large measure
to persistent strength in the dollar and declining interest rates.
   Talk began stirring in the financial world early this week that
the Federal Reserve might soon find room to relax its credit policy
further, prompted by slow-to-moderate economic growth and favorable
inflation news.
   Interest rates levelled off in the credit markets today. But
after hesitating for the first two hours of the session, stocks
began forging ahead again.
   Among the blue chips, USX rose 2\ to 38{; International Business

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.22 to 198.06. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.35 at 394.37.

<TEXT>
   Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno and Leona Helmsley
have more in common than a criminal record.
   Salerno was convicted under the criminal side of the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of running a
Godfather-style crime family _ the kind of target the RICO law was
written for 20 years ago.
   After Helmsley was found guilty of tax fraud, the hotel queen
was charged in a civil racketeering lawsuit with taking millions
from her ailing husband _ the type of case RICO opponents say the
law wasn't necessarily intended for.
   For the third time since 1986, Congress is considering a reform
of the civil racketeering law, aimed at stripping provisions
allowing triple damages and exempting the securities and
commodities industries from its scope.
   One of the most contentious issues in business and legal circles
today, the RICO ruckus pits a coalition of big business, labor and
securities firms against consumer groups, state prosecutors and
securities regulators.
   A Wall Street Journal editorial called civil RICO ``the most
abusive legal invention since the Alien and Sedition Laws.''
   Opponents quote cases from a divorce to a dispute over a rabbi.
They say the law has been used to bludgeon large settlements from
defendants, backlogged federal dockets and slandered businesses.
   ``You hate to tell your stockholders you're being sued in
federal court as a racketeer,'' said Kim R. Pearson, a Washington
lawyer representing the National Association of Manufacturers in a
coalition demanding reform.
   Defenders say RICO combats widespread business and securities
fraud by providing a powerful economic deterrent. They reject the
argument it encourages frivolous lawsuits.
   ``Silly RICO cases get thrown out by the courts,'' said Michael
Waldman, director of the consumer group Public Citizen's Congress
Watch in Washington. ``The issue is money. The issue is
white-collar crime.''
   ``They don't want to pay treble damages in the cases in which
people are responsible,'' added Notre Dame law professor G. Robert
Blakey, who helped draft the original racketeering statute.
   RICO was enacted in 1970 to attack organized crime. The civil
side allows plaintiffs who show two racketeering acts in 10 years
to sue for triple damages plus attorneys fees. Nothing limits its
use to mobsters.
   Criminal RICO has received big publicity partly because
prosecutors have used it to attack financial crime. Defendants risk
minimum 20-year prison terms, $25,000 fines per count and
forfeiture of assets before trial.
   A jury recently convicted six defendants in the first-ever use
of RICO against securities professionals, the Princeton-Newport
Partners tax fraud case. Bond financier Michael Milken and dozens
of Chicago commodity traders also face racketeering charges.
   RICO reformers aren't quibbling with these prosecutions. They're
more concerned about its use in inheritance fights or squabbles
between competitors, for example.
   ``Civil RICO has been badly abused,'' said Rep. Rick Boucher,
D-Va., sponsor of the House reform bill.
   ``It was designed to provide a remedy for people who were
victimized by organized crime activities,'' he said. ``It has been
used, however, almost exclusively in the context of ordinary
business disputes.''
   Uncertainty over the law limited the number of civil
racketeering suits to about 500 until the Supreme Court in 1985
upheld the statute and cases multiplied.
   The Administrative Office of U.S. Courts says 1,049 civil RICO
lawsuits were filed from July 1, 1988, to last June 30, about as
many as in each of the previous two years. Still, that represents
less than one-half of 1 percent of the total of 233,293 civil cases.
   Federal statistics show that in the 1987-88 period, the most
recent available, 132 cases were settled without trial. Since 1985,
experts say there have been only about 15 civil racketeering jury
verdicts. Judges have dismissed the bulk of cases or ruled without
a jury.
   Boucher claims the lure of triple damages ``makes civil RICO
irresistible to any plaintiff who can meet the requirements,'' and
that state-court fraud cases wind up in federal court.
   ``What that does is leverage very substantial settlements based
on less than substantial allegations from a defendant who fears
treble damages and also doesn't want to be branded a racketeer,''
he said.
   It's difficult for RICO reformers to identify settlements
reached to avoid a trial or threat of huge awards. Most cases they
cited during congressional hearings this year dealt with allegedly
abusive filings that were dismissed.
   In one, an Illinois rock concert promoter sued another over use
of an arena. Others include a free-lance reporter who sued ABC
Television for failing to give him credit on a story,
landlord-tenant disputes and allegations of fund-raising
irregularities in Walter Mondale's presidential campaign.
   Pending civil cases include a $250 million class action suit and
$1.1 billion government suit against defunct Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association; a $1 billion bond issue fraud suit by the
Washington Public Power Supply System against General Electric Co.;
and suits charging abortion protesters in Pennsylvania disrupted
businesses and damaged property.
   Large settlements include $25 million paid by Ashland Oil Co. in
a case brought by two former executives who claimed they were fired
for protesting alleged bribes to foreign officials, and a $15
million settlement by the accounting firm Laventhol &amp; Horwath after
it was convicted of aiding securities law violations by a financial
promoter.
   Anti-RICO forces maintain that state laws and regulatory
guidelines already cover abuses and protect defrauded consumers.
   ``The securities industry has had this unique case law that has
developed over 50 years that has given these people means of
recovery,'' said Donald Crawford, senior vice president of the
Securities Industry Association. ``There is no need for RICO.''
   Congress Watch's Waldman countered: ``There is a white-collar
crime wave going on in this country. It's hard to imagine how a
lobbyist for Wall Street can say with a straight face that the
existing laws are working well.''
   The reform battle aside, both sides agree the law needs to
better define racketeering.
   ``It's so vague that no one knows until after the fact what they
are required to do to avoid violating the law,'' said New York
attorney Jed Rakoff, who represents Eastern Airlines strikers suing
management for racketeering.
   The Supreme Court earlier this year practically invited a
challenge to the law on grounds of vagueness. In a speech, Chief
Justice William Rehnquist criticized abusive filings and called for
congressional action.
   ``Most of the civil suits filed under the statute have nothing
to do with organized crime,'' he said. ``They are garden-variety
civil fraud cases of the type traditionally litigated in state
courts...
   ``I think the time has arrived for Congress to enact amendments
to civil RICO to limit its scope to the sort of wrongs that are
connected to organized crime, or have some other reason for being
in federal court.''

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been 40 years since Kirk Kerkorian
refurbished a small twin-engine airplane and began shuttling
passengers between a Los Angeles suburb and the fledgling gaming
resort of Las Vegas.
   In the years since then, the shy son of Armenian immigrants has
built a billion-dollar business empire while forging grand designs
in the desert.
   Now he's embarking on his grandest yet _ an entertainment theme
park and his third shot at building the world's largest hotel.
   Kerkorian's announcement Tuesday of plans to build the $700
million project on the Las Vegas Strip is a case of promises kept.
   ``I'll be back,'' Kerkot the eight largest hotels in the world _ three
of them with the Kerkorian imprint.
   Kerkorian said Tuesday his MGM Grand Inc., will build the hotel
on a prime Strip corner now occupied by the Marina Hotel and Casino
and the Tropicana Country Club.
   ``I used the word `bullish' many years ago in talking about Las
Vegas,'' Kerkorian said. ``I'm still bullish on the city.''
   The 115-acre theme park, still in its conceptual and design
stage, will be a family attraction aimed at drawing middle-class
tourists when it opens sometime in late 1992.
   MGM Grand chairman Fred Benninger said his company is confident
the park will cash in on the trend toward family tourism in a town
once dominated by high-rolling gamblers.
   ``I remember the days when Las Vegas lived almost entirely on
the high roller,'' Benninger said Tuesday. ``You can't do that
anymore.''
   Kerkorian's company built the International Hotel, now the Las
Vegas Hilton, and later built the MGM Grand Hotel, now Bally's.
   The International had 1,500 rooms when it opened in 1967 as the
biggest resort in Las Vegas and the MGM surpassed that with 2,100
rooms when it was built in 1973.
   The Las Vegas Hilton now has 3,174 rooms and is the world's
largest hotel. That mark will be broken when the 4,032-room
Excalibur opens next June, across the Strip from Kerkorian's new
site.
   The Hilton's sister property, the Flamingo Hilton, will have
3,600 rooms when an expansion is completed next year. Kerkorian
once owned the Flamingo as well. And he owned the land on which
Caesars Palace was built.
   Kerkorian is expected to spend about $250 million on the new
hotel and $450 million on the theme park, which will include
facilities for film making.
   Some have compared Kerkorian with Howard Hughes, the reclusive
billionaire who once owned nine Nevada hotel casinos and whose
Summa Corp. still has vast real estate holdings in the Las Vegas
Valley. Both men had a penchant for the movie industry, gaming,
flying, Nevada, airlines _ and privacy.
   Kerkorian, the son of poor Armenian fruit farmers in Fresno,
Calif., dropped out of high school to help support his parents and
three brothers. He once attributed his business acumen to growing
up during the Depression years.
   ``I didn't have any really big motivation in my life,'' he once
said. ``First it was simply trying to earn enough to get something
to eat, then enough to buy a car.''
   In the late 1940s he refurbished a small plane and began
carrying gamblers, sightseers and wedding couples from the
Hawthorne, Calif. airport to Las Vegas.
   In 1947 he formed his own airline, Los Angeles Air Service,
which he later changed to Trans International Airlines. He sold the
airline to TransAmerica Corp. in 1968 in a deal that netted him
$104 million.
   By then he was in the hotel business in Las Vegas, the city that
``has always been on the plus side for us.''
   Today, Kerkorian's MGM Grand Inc., a separate company from his
MGM-UA Communications Corp., owns an all-frills Los Angeles-New
York airline as well as the Desert Inn. It also retains rights to a
stylized version of the famous MGM lion logo.
   Kerkorian, 72, had sold and bought back pieces of MGM-UA
Communications for two decades, a period during which he also
traded Las Vegas hotels the way most people buy cars.
   Last month, Australia's Qintex Group agreed to purchase MGM-UA _
including the original lion logo _ for $1.5 billion.
   Kerkorian continues to shun the spotlight and is reluctant to
talk about his business success.
   ``I'm just a small town boy who got lucky,'' he says.

<HEAD>Small Service Stations Squeezed By EPA Rules On Storage Tanks</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A spray-painted tin sign over Aldo Ranieri's idle pumps hangs as
an epitaph to a once-thriving business: ``NO GAS.''
   Ranieri is one of more than 20,000 independent service station
owners nationwide likely to go out of business because of new
environmental safety rules concerning underground storage tanks.
   The potential closures represent almost a fifth of all U.S.
gasoline retail outlets, threatening to significantly narrow
competition and raise prices, particularly in rural areas.
   Federal officials say the rules are aimed at protecting the
environment from underground leaks that could contaminate water
supplies.
   That's no consolation to people like Ranieri, who cannot afford
the enormous cost of replacing and insuring his tanks. ``Help,
that's what I need, help,'' Ranieri says.
   After 25 years of pumping gasoline at the same location in an
affluent Westchester County suburb of New York, Ranieri says state
officials forced him to stop selling gasoline four months ago when
he refused to have his tanks tested at a cost of several thousand
dollars.
   He has since laid off all but two employees, who continue to
repair cars in the garage.
   The federal regulations require service station owners to
replace or upgrade underground tanks by 1998. Before then they must
test their tanks, install leak detection devices and prove, through
pollution liability insurance or other means, that they can pay
damages if there's a leak.
   Oct. 26 is the deadline for owners of between 100 and 999 tanks
to have $1 million in insurance coverage to pay for possible leaks.
   Those who opt not to take the $1 million insurance generally
must be able to show they have a minimum net worth of $10 million
to cover the cost of cleaning a leak.
   With annual premiums more than doubling from an average of
$25,356 in 1986 to $66,064 in 1989, industry officials say many
station owners will not be able to comply by the deadline.
   ``Fifty-five percent of the people who should have insurance by
Oct. 26 won't and the situation is getting worse,'' says Phillip R.
Chisholm, executive vice president of the Petroleum Marketers
Association of America.
   A joint survey by three trade associations representing U.S.
gasoline marketers _ the petroleum marketers, the National
Association of Convenience Stores and the Society of Independent
Gasoline Marketers _ found that about 37,000 retailers with 100,000
tanks will likely miss the October deadline.
   Smaller owners like Ranieri, who own only a few tanks, have
until October 1990 to get coverage. But they face a December
deadline for testing tanks and installing leak detectors.
   Ranieri says he has asked Texaco Inc. for help, since he sells
the company's brand under a franchise, but has been turned down.
He's now seeking a buyer.
   Texaco concedes it has no program to help independent tank
owners.
   ``It's their responsibility,'' said Texaco spokesman Gary
Taylor. He said Texaco is considering assisting wholesalers with
insurance costs.
   The Petroleum Marketers Association estimates that at least
26,250 of the nation's 150,000 gasoline stations could close over
the next few years as a result of the Environmental Protection
Agency rules.
   Ranieri says his tanks are at least 30 years old and need
replacing. He estimates the cost could exceed $200,000 including
compliance with state regulations that require installation of
anti-vapor safety nozzles.
   ``I'm a little guy. For me to survive I have to replace the
tanks. I don't have the money,'' he says.
   Across the street at a Mobil station, business has picked up
since Ranieri's pumps closed. One recent weekday morning, a stream
of cars pulled in and out almost nonstop. The few unwary motorists
who drove into Ranieri's Texaco glimpsed the sign then wheeled over
to the Mobil pumps.
   ``They're busy all the time,'' Ranieri says. ``I'm too small to
fight. I can't fight the big guys.''
   Owners of 1,000 or more tanks such as Mobil Corp., which
operates the Mobil station, had to be in compliance by last
January. Most large oil companies already are self insured.
   Since the rules went into effect last December, all tank owners
are required to start testing the estimated 2 million underground
oil and gasoline tanks nationwide. Up to half are believed to
contain hazardous contaminants such as lead.
   ``Nobody is questioning the need for this,'' says Ron Brand,
director of EPA's underground storage tank program. ``The issue is
who pays, not whether we need it.''
   Older storage tanks are made of carbon steel, which corrodes,
and have typical design lives of 15-20 years. Products stored in
leaky or corroding tanks seep into water and underground wells.
   Tanks installed since 1985 had to be constructed of protected
steel, fiberglass or a sturdy composite, with non-corroding pipes.
   Jim McCormick, director of EPA's Policy and Standards Division
for underground storage tanks, says that leak damage often is
underestimated.
   ``They're not Love Canals, they're much smaller but there are
lots more of them,'' McCormick says.
   Up to 30 percent of the tanks could be leaking, although there
is no reliable estimate of the extent of environmental harm,
McCormick says.
   States such as California and Florida, which started testing
earlier than others, have found evidence of widespread leaks that
range in size from trickles to thousands of gallons.
   EPA officials say they are trying to ease the burden of the new
regulations by phasing in the rules and giving special
consideration to problem cases.
   One provision, for example, enables EPA Commissioner William K.
Reilly to suspend enforcement of the insurance deadline for six
months if coverage is not available, Brand says.
   But tank owners should not depend on the provision, Brand says,
because ``we don't have evidence that it's not available.''
   The petroleum marketers group has asked the EPA to suspend the
compliance date for one year, arguing that many insurance companies
remain reluctant to provide coverage before tanks are upgraded.
Other insurers require $100,000 deductibles, Chisholm says.
   Industry sources say that some banks also are reluctant to lend
money for tank upgrades because they consider it a high-risk loan,
so many tank owners are in a Catch 22 situation.
   While some states are coming to the rescue by establishing trust
funds to help owners upgrade tanks and cover the major portion of
spills, only a few have been approved by the EPA so far.
   ``The way I see it I'm out of business,'' says Ranieri.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, following
through on Tuesday's upsurge to record highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 40.84 points on
Tuesday, rose another 12.35 to 2,766.91 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 7 to 6 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 799 up, 622
down and 496 unchanged.
   Analysts noted some ``catch-up'' buying by investors who were
caught off guard by the market's revived rally this week.
   The new advance in stock prices was attributed in large measure
to persistent strength in the dollar and declining interest rates.
   Talk began stirring in the financial world early this week that
the Federal Reserve might soon find room to relax its credit policy
further, prompted by slow-to-moderate economic growth and favorable
inflation news.
   Interest rates levelled off in the credit markets today. But
after hesitating for the first two hours of the session, stocks
began forging ahead again.
   Among the blue chips, USX rose 2{ to 38}; International Business
Machines 1| to 107|; Sears Roebuck { to 44, and General Electric \
to 58}.
   Microsoft climbed 5{ to 74{ in the over-the-counter market. The
company said it expects to report a 34 percent revenue increase for
its fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 30.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.01 to 197.85. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.43 at 394.45.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 161.94 million shares with an

<TEXT>
   Investor Alfred A. Checchi says he won't get
a new partner to make up the $225 million from KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines that the federal government ruled out as part of the
takeover of NWA Inc. by a Checchi-led group.
   The Transportation Department last week gave Checchi six months
to cut KLM's investment to $175 million from $400 million, which
had been the largest equity contribution to the deal to buy NWA,
the parent of Northwest Airlines.
   The department said it was worried that KLM could control the
airline even though it held only 5 percent of Northwest's shares.
   In an interview with the Los Angeles Times published Wednesday,
Checchi said, ``I'm not entertaining the thought of taking on
another partner. That wouldn't make sense.''
   Instead, the Los Angeles financier said, he plans to repay KLM
the $225 million from Northwest's cash flow, or by issuing
nonvoting preferred stock, or possibly by letting employees buy
into the company.
   NWA already has reduced its takeover-related debt from $3.35
billion to $3.1 billion, said Checchi.
   The group led by Checchi, including KLM and other investors,
bought NWA for $3.65 billion in June. Checchi replaced Steven
Rothmeier as NWA chairman last week.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed

   Corn and soybean harvesting has advanced rapidly during the the

<HEAD>Skinner Defends Order Limiting KLM's Participation in Northwest Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said
Wednesday he was not ushering in new re-regulation of the airline
industry with a consent order restricting a Dutch airline's
participation in the buyout of Northwest Airlines.
   Appearing before House and Senate subcommittees looking into
leveraged buyouts and foreign ownership in the airline industry,
Skinner said his decision to restrict the buyout of Northwest
Airlines by Wings Holdings Inc. _ in which KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
has a major investment _ was based on existing law.
   He defended the influx of foreign capital and the use of buyouts
to ``recapitalize'' a company when the value of assets _ such as
airplanes and various rights _ exceeds the value of company shares.
   ``But when they turn to highly leveraged, that's bad,'' he said.
   In a leveraged buyout, the new owners pay for the company by
borrowing against its assets. To pay off the debt, they often have
to break up the company and sell off parts of it.
   Skinner said that in highly leveraged buyouts, the debt service
can detract from important investments in safety and an up-to-date
fleet.
   Two aviation subcommittees are discussing proposed legislation
that would make it more difficult for airlines to be acquired
through leveraged buyouts. The Senate version addresses foreign
investments as well.
   Skinner, although officially undecided on either House or Senate
proposal, said he felt that the law already gives the department
authority to act when it questions the fitness of the airline to
operate as a result of a takeover.
   Although the Northwest case ``would procedurally have been
cleaner'' had it been done earlier with specific guidelines, too
many laws on the books make it easier for lawyers and entrepreneurs
to find loopholes, he said.
   ``It's more difficult to unwind a transaction that has already
been put together than it is to be there from the beginning,''
Skinner said, but he added that ``it is not our intention'' to
reintroduce regulation.
   He disagreed with a specific proposal in the House bill that
would allow no buyout that raised the debt-equity ratio beyond 1:1
in takeovers, saying the ratio had to be examined individually in
each instance. That ratio doesn't exist with airlines in operation.
   Foreign ownership of airlines is limited under the Federal
Aviation Act. Although the provisions of the KLM-Northwestern deal
did not meet the literal guidelines, Skinner said it was clear that
foreign control was an issue.
   On Friday, the department announced that the new partners in the
deal would cut KLM's interest from 57 percent to 25 percent. KLM
would keep a seat on the 12-member board but would have to excuse
itself from decisions involving competition. Also, the partners
agreed to eliminate a three-member advisory committee that KLM
would have controlled.
   The $705 million leveraged buyout, announced in June, is the
largest in the airline industry, Skinner said, and proposed a
fourfold increase in the company's long-term debt.
   The foreign ownership provision is to protect the ability of
civilian airlines to function in wartime emergencies, such as the
transport of troops. ``It is important if not imperative,'' that
the foreign ownership rule be enforced because of that
consideration, he said.
   Skinner said he was particularly concerned about the idea of
having a KLM board member on the Northwest board when the two
airlines would be technically in competition.

   The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee
and its senior Republican on Wednesday reassured the Federal
Reserve Board that they would oppose efforts to weaken the central
bank's independence.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., the panel's chairman, noted
several proposals introduced in the House that would give the
administration more control of the Fed, which influences the
nation's economy by manipulating interest rates.
   The seven Fed members are appointed by the president. But the
chairman serves a four-year term and can't be removed by the
president. Other members are appointed to 14-year terms.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Joint Economics
Committee, has proposed legislation adding the treasury secretary
to the Fed board. Other House members are proposing other changes,
including adding representatives of farmers, builders, consumers
and small-business people to the board.
   Riegle, at a hearing reviewing the government's savings and loan
bailout, called Hamilton's proposal, ``probably not a sound one.''
   ``I would be reluctant to make any moves politicizing the Fed,''
he told Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   Riegle was backed by Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the senior
Republican on the banking committee.
   ``Let the members of the House fiddle around with it all they
want. Let me suggest there aren't going to be any changes like that
on the Senate side,'' Garn said.

<HEAD>Burroughs Wellcome to Make AZT Available in Syrup Form</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burroughs Wellcome Co. has
introduced its anti-AIDS drug in a strawberry-flavored syrup to
help patients who have difficulty swallowing.
   The syrup form of Retrovir _ the brand name for AZT _ is
expected to be available in pharmacies within four to six weeks,
company officials say.
   ``This new formulation should provide more flexibility in making
dosage adjustments and be particularly useful to patients who have
difficulty swallowing capsules for a variety of reasons, including
lesions in the throat and mouth,'' said Kathryn H. Pattishall,
project leader for Retrovir at Burroughs Wellcome.
   Kathy Bartlett, a spokewoman for Burroughs Wellcome, said the
syrup would also help doctors adjust the dosage.
   AZT capsules were approved by the Food and Drug Administration
in March 1987, and the syrup received approval last month.
   AZT was rushed into production in 1986 after only nine months of
clinical tests, when preliminary results showed 8 percent of
patients died while taking the drug, compared with 40 percent in a
similar test group not given the drug.
   AZT is the only drug approved by the FDA that directly combats

<HEAD>Defense Electronics Should Prosper Despite Pentagon Cuts, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Within 10 years, Pentagon spending will
return to its level before the Reagan administration's defense
buildup, according to a study by leaders of the defense electronics
industry.
   But defense electronics will still get a healthy cut of defense
funds, said officials of the Electronics Industries Association,
meeting in Los Angeles.
   ``Defense electronics, despite a declining overall budget, is
holding its own as a quality enhancer for most weapon systems,''
said Geoffrey K. Bentley, chairman of an EIA subcommittee that
compiled the organization's annual 10-year forecast. ``In fact,
over the 10-year period, defense electronics will show real
growth.''
   Industry officials presented the study Tuesday at the
conference, which attracted more than 350 defense industry
executives and managers from across the country.
   The 90-page study, drawn from interviews with industry
executives, congressional sources, Pentagon officials, academics
and Wall Street analysts, says inflation will outpace the overall
defense budget.
   Although the budget is expected to reach as much as $375 billion
by the end of the 1990s, it will actually shrink 1.5 percent when
adjusted for inflation in 1990 dollars, Bentley said.
   ``We are looking at 12 straight years of real decline, which
will bring us back to the early Reagan years and fiscal 1981,'' he
said.
   Officials warned, however, that a loss of power by Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev and a return by the Soviet Union to
policies of the past could result in a change in the entire
equation.
   Barring such a change, cutbacks in big-ticket items such as
military personnel, missiles, tanks and aircraft appear inevitable,
association officials said. But military spending will remain
strong for defense electronics in areas such as space,
communications equipment, high-tech improvements in missiles and
aircraft and other weaponry.

   The stock market climbed to record highs for the
second straight session today, following through on Tuesday's sharp
gain.
   Analysts noted some ``catch-up'' buying by investors who were
caught off guard by the market's revived rally this week.
   The new advance in stock prices was attributed in large measure
to persistent strength in the dollar and declining interest rates.
   Talk began stirring in the financial world early this week that
the Federal Reserve might soon find room to relax its credit policy
further, prompted by slow-to-moderate economic growth and favorable
inflation news.
   Interest rates levelled off in the credit markets today. But
after hesitating for the first two hours of the session, stocks
began forging ahead again.

   Sales of North American-built cars and trucks by
the nation's Big Three automakers jumped 10 percent in late
September, due in large part to a 45.3 percent rise in General
Motors Corp. truck sales, the companies said Wednesday.
   For the entire model year, which ended Sept. 30, combined sales
of cars and trucks assembled in North America by GM, Ford Motor Co.
and Chrysler Corp. were up a more modest 0.1 percent compared with
the previous year, which proved to be the third-best model year on
record for automakers as a whole.
   The companies said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate
of 42,407 during the Sept. 21-30 period this year, compared with a
daily rate of 38,550 during the same time last year.
   Car sales rose 7.2 percent and truck sales, fueled by the big GM
increase, rose 14.8 percent.
   In September, GM was offering its dealers incentives to sell the
company's trucks, including pickups, sport-utility vehicles and
minivans. That helped push GM's light truck sales for the entire
month up 42.3 percent over September 1988. For the model year, GM
trucks sales were up 6.1 percent over last year.
   For the model year, which began Oct. 1, 1988, truck sales by the
Big Three were up 2.2 percent, offsetting a 1.1 percent decline in
car sales.
   GM also posted strong late-September car sales figures, rising
13.7 percent to an average daily sales rate of 14,660 during the
period this year from a rate of 12,892 last year.
   For the first nine months of the 1989 calendar year, GM's car
sales were down 5.6 percent and for the model year, car sales were
up 3.2 percent.
   While GM was gaining truck sales in late September, Ford was
losing. The nation's No. 2 automaker said its late-September light
truck sales were off 9 percent. For the calendar year, Ford's truck
sales were down 2.1 percent and for the model year, they were off
1.8 percent.
   Ford's car sales were up 6 percent in late September and 0.2
percent for the calendar year. For the 1989 model year, Ford's car
sales were up 3.2 percent.
   Chrysler, like GM, showed an increase in truck sales, but not
nearly as dramatic. Chrysler said its late-September light truck
sales were up 6 percent over the same time last year, and up 0.1
for the calendar year to date. For the model year, truck sales were
up 1.6 percent.
   Chrysler's car sales dropped 12.6 percent in late September,
and, through Sept. 30 of this calendar year, the company's car
sales were off 11.2 percent. For the just-ended model year,
Chrysler's car sales were down 7.5 percent compared with last year.

   Gasoline futures prices tumbled Wednesday after
the American Petroleum Institute said inventories had risen by 4.5
million barrels last week.
   The API report released late Tuesday showed total gasoline
stocks at 223.7 million barrels for the week ending last Friday.
Analysts said the bearish report drove prices downward.
   The November contract for unleaded gasoline on the New York
Mercantile Exchange lost 1.23 cents a gallon to 55.41 cents.
Subsequent months also lost ground, with the December contract
falling 0.91 cents a gallon to 54.17 cents.
   The increase in gasoline inventories was slightly above
expectations, said Andrew Lebow, energy futures analyst for E.D.&amp;F.
Man International Futures Inc.
   Home heating oil futures traded on the mercantile exchange also
fell. The November contract for heating oil was down 0.69 cents a
gallon to close at 58.99 cents. Subsequent months also fell, though
by less.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, gained 2 cents to close at $20.15 per
42-gallon barrel on the mercantile exchange. Contracts for later
months fell slightly.
   Analysts said little influenced the price of crude as the weekly
API report showed an expected increase in stocks of 1.7 million
barrels to 333.3 million barrels.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Sink To New 14-Year Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   World coffee prices sank to new 14-year lows Wednesday amid
deepening pessimism about the prospects for a return to the
price-support measures abandoned by the International Coffee
Organization in July.
   On other commodity markets, sugar futures climbed sharply,
precious metals were higher, energy futures mostly were lower and
grain and livestock futures were mixed.
   Coffee futures settled 2.5 cents to 3.7 cents lower on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange with the contract for
delivery in December at 73.03 cents a pound, the lowest settlement
for a near-month coffee contract since late 1975.
   The International Coffee Organization's latest indicator of the
average price of coffee traded throughout the world, released
Wednesday, was 64.31 cents a pound, also a 14-year low.
   Market analysts called the sell-off a continuation of Tuesday's
steep slide, which was triggered when Jorio Dauster, Brazil's chief
coffee executive, said there was no chance of an early return to an
export quota system designed to keep excess world production off
the market.
   A new coffee agreement is impossible without support from
Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer.
   Coffee futures prices have plunged about 36 percent in the three
months since the ICO suspended the quotas because of
dissatisfaction among its largest consumer members, including the
United States.
   Dauster made his remarks at an ICO meeting in London that is
scheduled to end Friday. Key producer members of the 74-nation
group reportedly were drafting a resolution Wednesday on how to
proceed with negotiations on a new agreement but analysts said they
expected no movement in the near future.
   ``Unless it's radical surgery, it's difficult to see how
anything that comes out of the meeting in London is anything more
than window dressing,'' said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Many analysts predicted prices would drop further. But some said
roaster buying for the winter season, when coffee consumption
reaches its annual peak, should surface within the next two weeks
to slow or halt the slide.
   World sugar futures soared on the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange
amid indications that India had made a major sugar purchase. Sugar
settled .31 cent to .75 cent higher with January at 13.85 cents a
pound.
   Gold and silver futures posted modest gains in quiet trading on
New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 10 cents to 20 cents higher with October at $367 a
troy ounce; silver was 2.8 cents to 3.1 cents higher with December
at $5.328 a troy ounce.
   Gasoline led most energy futures lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in reaction to Tuesday's weekly American
Petroleum Institute report showing increased U.S. supplies of
crude, gasoline and petroleum distillates.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents lower to 2
cents higher with November at $20.15 a barrel; heating oil was .10
cent to .69 cent lower with November at 58.99 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .40 cent to 1.23 cents lower with November at
55.41 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade as harvest-related selling offset buying linked to new export
sales of U.S. wheat and corn.
   Wheat futures settled { cent lower to 2 cents higher with
December at $4.09\ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to { cent
higher with December at $2.39 a bushel; oats were { cent to 1{
cents lower with December at $1.46\ a bushel; soybeans were 1}
cents lower to } cent higher with November at $5.76{ a bushel.
   Profit-taking pressured pork futures on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange while slack beef demand weighed on live cattle futures.
But strong cash markets boosted feeder cattle.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .30 cent lower with October at
71.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher
with October at 83.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .63
cent lower with October at 44.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .33 cent to .88 cent lower with February at 48.17 cents a
pound.

   The dollar was mixed against major currencies in
fairly quiet trading Wednesday with traders cautious ahead of the
meeting of West Germany's central bank.
   Some analysts expect the Bundesbank to raise its key lending
rates when it meets Thursday in an effort to push the dollar lower.
Its discount rate now stands at 5 percent and the Lombard rate is
at 7 percent.
   ``All eyes are watching the Bundesbank tomorrow,'' said Ronald
Holzer, chief currency broker for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   West Germany is one of seven industrial nations, including the
United States, that have joined in a concerted effort to weaken the
dollar.
   Analysts said that if intervention fails the backup plan is for
some countries to raise their interest rates.
   Higher West German interest rates would make mark-denominated
assets more attractive than dollar holdings and would tend to boost
the mark against the U.S. dollar.
   If the Bundesbank decides to raise interest rates other central
banks probably will follow, analysts said.
   ``If the Germans do it, it will be a matter of time before Japan
does it not only to show coordinated effort politically but also to
bolster the yen,'' said Jack Barbanel, currency analyst with First
Global Asset Management.
   Some analysts said the currency markets have already come to
expect a half-percentage-point rise so the Bundesbank will have to
kick rates higher to lower the dollar.
   ``If they raise it only a half-percentage-point it will take a
lot of the sparkle out of the Deutsche mark and other currencies
that it has appreciated against,'' Holzer said.
   Central banks began their intervention more than a week ago
after a meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in
which they agreed that the dollar's recent rise was
``inconsistent'' with longer-run economic fundamentals. They are
the United States, Britain, Japan, France, West Germany, Italy and
Canada.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.05 yen to a closing 140.60 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 141.05 yen. In New York, the
dollar traded at 141.475, up from 141.20 late Tuesday.
   In London, the pound traded at $1.6055, unchanged from late
Tuesday. In New York trading the dollar strengthened as the pound
changed hands at $1.6020, down from $1.6045 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8815 West German marks, down from 1.8865; 1.6290
Swiss francs, down from 1.6350; 1.17475 Canadian dollars, down from
1.17495; 6.3825 French francs, down from 6.4000; and 1,376.75
Italian lire, down from 1,379.65.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday's prices,
included: 1.8770 West German marks, down from 1.8865; 1.6275 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6350; 6.3700 French francs, down from 6.4005;
2.1185 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1195; 1,373.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,380.50; and 1.1742 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1763.
   Gold traded in London late Wednesday at $366.25 per troy ounce,
up slightly from late Tuesday's $365.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $366, up from $365.25 late Tuesday.
Gold closed in Hong Kong unchanged at $366.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $367 an ounce, up from $366.30 on Tuesday.
Republic National bank of New York said gold was bid late in the
day at $366 an ounce, up from $365.50 on Tuesday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.24 a troy
ounce, up from Tuesday's $5.22.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled
at $5.248 an ounce, up from Tuesday's close of $5.217.

   A bill approved by the Senate Finance
Committee early Wednesday would give more than 100 years of amnesty
to fraternal groups, taverns and convenience stores for past-due
levies under a little-known tax on liquor retailers.
   Protests over the tax had grown after a Pennsylvania Elks lodge
got a $9,000 bill for 50 years of non-payment.
   The measure would prohibit the federal government from
collecting unpaid balances and penalties on the 123-year-old tax if
they accrued before Jan. 1, 1985, according to Sen. John Heinz,
R-Pa.
   Heinz, a member of the committee, argued successfully to get the
provision included in a sweeping budget bill. Both the provision
and the bill were approved on voice votes.
   Although the tax has been in the books since 1866, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms says that up to 40 percent of
retailers never heard of it until the agency began a vigorous
collection effort last year. The crackdown began after Congress
raised the yearly tax 363 percent, from $54 to $250 for each
establishment.
   Heinz estimated his amendment would cost the government about $2
million per year in lost revenues through the 1994 fiscal year.
   According to bureau spokesman Jack Killorin, the list of
organizations liable for the tax includes some country clubs,
lodges, limousine operators and even bait and tackle shops _ any
organization that sells beer, wine and distilled spirits directly
to the public. In all, Killorin estimates that 600,000
organizations must pay the ``special occupational tax.''
   Responsibility for collections shifted to jthe Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in 1986 from the Internal Revenue
Service. Killorin said in a recent interview that the bureau was
working with states to make certain retailers aware of their
obligations. He said the agency was willing to negotiate payment
plans so retailers can get their debt paid off.
   Opposition to the collection effort gained momentum in Congress
after Elks Lodge 109 in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., received a bill 11
months ago for $9,776.98 from the bureau, representing unpaid taxes
and penalties back to 1940 when the lodge got its liquor license.
   The Elks, who said they had never heard of the tax, complained
to Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., who said in an interview Wednesday
that he has been fighting for a statute of limitations on the tax
because the establishments being dunned include ``the small tap
rooms, the private clubs _ people who can least afford to pay a tax
they knew nothing about for years and years.''
   Bureau spokeswoman Dot Koester said Wednesday that the agency
was taking no position on the Senate committee action. ``Whatever
Congress passes, we'll enforce. It won't be a problem for us,'' she
said.
   The Pennsylvania Elks lodge, which is celebrating its 100th
anniversary, recently settled with the bureau for $844.12, lodge
attorney Peter Paul Olszewski said Wednesday. The lodge argued that
it had not been open and functioning during part of the period for
which it was being taxed.
   But if the committee-passed provision becomes law, Olszewski
said the lodge might petition ATF for a refund.
   ``You can call this the `Elks Lodge Bill.' I think there would
be a tremendous amount of satisfaction to see Congress remedy an
administrative problem,'' Olszewski said
   Heinz's amendment was included in a sweeping bill designed to
make changes in the law to achieve the budget target set by
Congress at the beginning of the fiscal year. Heinz said in a
statement Wednesday that the provision ``provides reasonable relief
to many retailers, most of whom are small businesses and had no
intention of evading a tax.''
   The House Ways and Means Committee failed to include a provision
similar to Heinz's in its corresponding bill. Assuming passage by
the Senate, the matter would be resolved by a House-Senate
conference committee.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Dip</HEAD>

   Government bond prices finished slightly lower
Wednesday as trading slowed in advance of an important economic
report later this week on employment in September.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 1-16 point, or about
63 cents for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield held steady at
8.16 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday.
   Corporate issues also dipped, but tax-exempt municipals advanced.
   Market watchers said dealings were listless for most of the day
as traders were reluctant to make large commitments to either buy
or sell bonds in advance of Friday's scheduled release of the
September employment report.
   Some analysts were looking for payroll growth of about 275,000
compared with growth of about 110,000 in August.
   That would suggest continued vitality in the economy and some
analysts said they doubted that the Federal Reserve Board would
adjust its monetary policy as a result of that type of figure.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of
short-term, intermediate and long-term governments were all down by
between 1-16 point and 3-32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial
information service reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, lost 0.72 to 1,174.05.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities
of five years or longer, fell 0.08 to 329.70.
   But in the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40
actively traded municipal bonds rose 3-16 to 92[. The average yield
to maturity fell to 7.38 percent from 7.40 percent late Tuesday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.04 percent as the
discount gained 3 basis points to 7.78 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.30 percent as the discount advanced 4 basis points
to 7.87 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.38 percent as
the discount rose 2 basis points to 7.79 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8\ percent, down from 9 percent late Tuesday.
   But analysts said the relatively low funds rate was due to
technical conditions in the short-term market for bank borrowings
as Wednesday marked the end of a bank reserve reporting period.

   Integrated Resources Inc., a financial services
company struggling because of heavy debts, said Wednesday it has
agreed to sell its United Resources subsidiary to the Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co. for an undisclosed amount.
   Announcement of the sale marked another step in Integrated's
plans to sell its businesses in order to raise cash for debt
obligations. In August, the company said it was selling four other
subsidiaries to the family-owned Whitehall Financial Group
partnership for about $310 million.
   United Resources provides retirement and financial programs to
more than 3,000 institutions and more than 70,000 individuals
employed in public school systems, colleges, nonprofit
organizations and the health care industry.
   In a statement about the sale, Met Life said that it also was
acquiring a segment of Integrated's flexible annuity operation,
with assets totaling $565 million, also for an undisclosed price.
   Integrated, a former high-flying real estate and insurance
concern, has faced increasing troubles repaying its debt, which
totals about $1.75 billion. In June the company defaulted on $955
million in short-term obligations and declared a moratorium on all
debt payments while it restructured.
   Met Life is one of the biggest U.S. insurance and financial
service concerns, with more than $125 billion of assets under
management.

<HEAD>Times Herald Asks FCC to Revoke Belo Station's License</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dallas Times Herald turned to federal
regulators Wednesday in its war with rival Dallas Morning News,
asking them to revoke the license of a television station owned by
the parent company of The Morning News.
   The Times Herald asked the Federal Communications Commission to
revoke WFAA-TV's license because of A.H. Belo Corp.'s ``naked and
unjustifiable'' actions in stripping the Times Herald of 26 popular
features it had been purchasing from Universal Press Syndicate.
   Belo General Counsel Michael McCarthy declined to comment on the
action, citing the Times Herald's pending lawsuit on some of the
same issues. ``We fully expect to be vindicated in trial,'' he said.
   As part of a joint venture between Belo and Universal Press, the
larger Morning News won exclusive right in the Dallas market to the
syndicate's features, which include Doonesbury, Erma Bombeck and
Dear Abby.
   The Times Herald has lost previous attempts in federal and state
court to block the action, and most of the features have begun
appearing in The Morning News. A trial on the Times Herald's
antitrust suit against Belo and Universal is pending in state
District Court.
   ``Belo has used its newspaper-television combination to engage
in conduct that severely undermines competition between the Dallas
Morning News and the Dallas Times Herald,'' says the petition to
the FCC.
   The FCC has outlawed joint newspaper-television ownership since
1975, but allowed such ownership to continue in Dallas and other
cities where it already was in place.
   WFAA is the leading television station in the Dallas-Fort Worth
market.
   Under the joint venture announced in August, Belo and Universal
agreed to explore television programming possibilities for some of
the syndicate's features, and Belo President James P. Sheehan
described the exclusivity clause as ``really secondary.''
   The Times Herald's FCC petition said the joint venture ``is
nothing more than a sham to cover Belo's real agenda, the
elimination of its only competitor in the Dallas newspaper market.''
   The petition says Belo's $1 million payment to Universal Press
for the features ``suggests that Belo is paying not for the right
to produce new video products, but rather for a monopoly of the
Dallas newspaper market.''
   Times Herald Publisher John Buzzetta said the petition was filed
reluctantly.
   ``We like competition, but we want to compete fairly and
honestly and insist that our competitor do the same,'' Buzzetta
said in a news release.
   The two papers have fought bitterly during the past few years,
even challenging each other's circulation figures in court.
   Edyth Wise, chief of the complaints and investigations branch in
the enforcement division of FCC, said ``we operate totally on a
complaint basis. Every action (on revocation) is on the basis of a
complaint, by listeners and frequently by competitors.''
   A complaint by a newspaper against a television station,
however, ``frankly that's unusual,'' she said, ``although they're
free to do it.''

<HEAD>Lorenzo Says Eastern Rebuilding into Better Airline</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto HT1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said
Wednesday that Eastern Airlines is continuing to recover from a
bitter strike and will emerge from bankruptcy proceedings as a
better carrier.
   ``The rebuilding of Eastern is on target,'' Lorenzo said at the
annual Airport Operators Council International Conference.
   Eastern's Machinists, pilots and flight attendants went on
strike March 4, forcing the Miami-based carrier to file for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection. Eastern and Houston-based Continental
Airlines are both subsidiaries of Texas Air, which also is based in
Houston.
   ``We're bringing Eastern back sounder, stronger and better than
it's been in years,'' Lorenzo told a luncheon at a Houston hotel.
   Next year ``will be a great year for Eastern,'' he said. ``Its
reorganization will be behind us. The airline will be providing
aggressive, competitive service up and down the East Coast, in and
out of Atlanta and throughout South America.
   ``This past weekend we added another 100 flights, bringing us to
about 70 percent of the pre-strike Eastern Airlines, or about 700
flights a day,'' he said. ``And I don't mind telling you that by
December, we'll be over 80 percent of the pre-strike airline.''
   But of the estimated 3,000 pre-strike pilots, Lorenzo said,
``there's probably going to be 2,000 pilots who may never see
Eastern Airlines again because they were misguided and brainwashed
by a national organization that has refused to face up to where we
are today, and indeed, has tried to take over control of Eastern
Airlines in an illegal way.''
   Lorenzo also discussed the domestic airline industry, and the
need for carriers to be free to finance their needs. There is an
important link, he said, between the globalization of U.S. airlines
and the current concern by some over leveraged buyouts and foreign
investment in American carriers.

<HEAD>Seasoned Textile Executive Buys Dan River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANVILLE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan River Inc., a textile company with
7,000 employees and four plants in the Danville area, is being sold
to an investment group headed by Joseph Lanier, officials announced
Wednesday.
   Lanier, a veteran textile executive from West Point, Ga.,
declined to name the price paid for Dan River. The company, more
than 100 years old, is saddled with an estimated $50 million debt
from an attempted hostile takeover in 1983 that forced the company
to purchase its own stock and become privately held.
   Lanier and Lester Hudson, president and chief executive of Dan
River, issued a statement saying an all-cash transaction was agreed
to by the company, the trustee of the employee stock ownership plan
and an acquisition company headed by Lanier.
   They plan to complete the sale of Dan River by the end of the
month.
   Hudson said the transaction ``will provide the company with the
capital necessary to further modernize and expand our Danville
facilities.'' Dan River began a $25 million home fashions
modernization at its nearby Schoolfield plant last year.
   Hudson said Lanier, 57, has a proven record of success with West
Point-Pepperell Inc. Lanier built West Point-Pepperell into the
owner of some of the textile and apparel industry's most famous
brand names before he was ousted as head of the company in February
during a hostile takeover by Farley Inc.
   Lanier, the fourth generation of his family to run what began in
1890 as West Point Manufacturing Co., said of Dan River: ``It is a
fine company with a good name and has a dedicated group of
employees. The future of Dan River is bright.''
   Both men said the company name will not be changed and that Dan
River will continue to be based in Danville.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before a background that included jewelry
and a clock purportedly made of a dismantled SS-20 missile, the
Soviet Consulate was the setting Wednesday for the announcement of
a joint venture to put Soviet products on sale in exclusive shops
in both countries.
   ``This is an attempt to show that working for peace is
profitable,'' Soviet Consul General Valentin Kamenev told a crowd
of reporters nibbling on cabbage-stuffed piroshikis out of the
consul's kitchen. ``We are going in the right direction.''
   Kamenev and San Francisco socialite Pat Montandon, who has been
waging a U.S.-Soviet peace movement of her own for eight years,
said the ``make peace profitable'' venture will install
``perestroika'' shops around this country to exclusively handle a
variety of products from the U.S.S.R.
   ``The climate for that, in Soviet-American relations, has never
been better,'' remarked Kamenev.
   Pat Montandon and Associates and the Soviet producers are to
share in any profits from the sale of the goods that will be
available in both countries, she said. The flagship shop of 3,000
square feet is scheduled to open in San Francisco in the spring and
investors are being sought, she said.
   At one point Montandon modeled a decorated woman's jacket made
from the top of a Red Army uniform.
   In a self-financed program called ``Children as Peacemakers,''
Montandon estimated she has escorted some 200 youngsters to the
Soviet Union in 22 trips since 1982.
   The announcement reported that three ventures, the first
involving the 150-branch Soviet Peace Committee of the U.S.S.R.,
will do business with the Montandon group, called PMA.
   PMA and the committee, she said, plan to bring to the United
States goods including Soviet Army uniforms and artifacts
manufactured from weapons disarmed by U.S.-Soviet agreement.
   Another agreement involves the manufacture of a line of
cosmetics and health-care products to satisfy needs of Soviet
women, she said.
   The cosmetics, declared Montandon, will include ``a secret
Soviet ingredient from the Caucasus, where it is common for people
to live more than 100 years.''
   The third pact involves Soviet sculptor Zurab Tserteli, who has
agreed to allow the Montandon group to be his agent in the United
States. The artist, winner of the Lenin Prize, is to make available
for export art work of his colleagues in the Georgian Union of
Designers.
   Montandon made an impassioned plea for the United States to
lower tariffs on Soviet imports. She said current U.S. policy
amounts to a trade barrier to Soviet-American business
relationships.
   There are currently more than 900 joint ventures between the
Soviet Union and other countries. Less than 40 of them are with the
United States.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday
named a former commodities enforcement official as its new
president.
   R. Patrick Thompson, who was the executive vice president of the
exchange, succeeds Rosemary T. McFadden, who resigned in July.
Thompson had served as chief of staff since McFadden's resignation.
   Nymex Chairman Z. Lou Guttman said the Nymex board selected
Thompson for his ``extensive operational and regulatory management
skills and expertise.''
   Thompson, whose appointment is effective immediately, formerly
was an attorney with the New York regional office of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission's enforcement division.
   The CFTC is an independent federal agency charged with
regulating the nation's commodities markets in New York, Chicago
and other cities.
   Thompson also has served as an executive for the exchange's
compliance division and as general counsel.
   Nymex, the world's largest energy futures exchange, is one of
several commodities exchanges that has come under scrutiny in the
last year for alleged trading practices violations.
   More than 40 traders and brokers at the Chicago Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest
commodities exchanges, were indicted in August after a 2{-year
undercover investigation in which FBI agents posing as traders
taped conversations.
   In May, the government subpoenaed more than 50 traders from four
of New York's five commodities exchanges, including Nymex, about
trading practices by firms and individuals. Nymex officials have
said they do not know the scope of the investigation, which is
continuing.
   The Commodity Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and
the New York Cotton Exchange were the other New York exchanges
targeted by federal investigators.
   Nymex recently announced it is seeking CFTC approval for new,
stricter rules aimed at reducing trading violations.
   One rule would make suspension mandatory for anyone engaging in
``fraud or deceit in connection with the customer order'' and would
raise the fine for major offenses to $250,000 from $100,000.

<TEXT>
   The $50 billion Congress voted two months ago
to rescue failed savings institutions may not be enough, a top
regulator said Wednesday, raising the possibility that taxpayers
could be asked for a second bailout.
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman,
whose agency is in charge of disposing of bankrupt thrifts, told
the Senate Banking Committee it is much too early to reliably
predict the cost of the bailout.
   But, he said, ``it is possible that $50 billion will prove to be
an insufficient amount to deal with potential failures.''
   His comments, included in written testimony to the panel, which
is taking Congress' first look at the bailout since it was enacted
Aug. 9, are the strongest yet from a government official. Private
analysts have been saying for months that the $50 billion likely
will prove to be only a down payment.
   Seidman said the Resolution Trust Corp., operated by the FDIC to
dispose of failed S&amp;Ls, expects losses on the 283 seized by
regulators so far to total $35 billion.
   By the time the bailout ends in August 1992, regulators may have
seized as many as 300 more dead S&amp;Ls, bringing the total to nearly
600, he said. Those projections ``raise questions about the
adequacy of the $50 billion in RTC funding.''
   However, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who heads an
administration board overseeing the RTC's performance, said ``I
know of nothing that's occurred since the bill passed to change my
mind'' that $50 billion likely is sufficient.
   That ``isn't the point. Maybe we need 52, maybe we need 48. The
point is we've taken a bonfire and tamped it down to the point
where it's embers,'' Brady said.
   Seidman, answering questions from senators, softened his tone a
bit, emphasizing the impossibility of making a certain loss
estimate. Nevertheless, he said, ``there's no way we can say for
sure that $50 billion is enough.''
   On a related matter, he said the RTC may have to borrow $25
billion or more, in addition to the $50 billion, to provide working
cash until it can recover money by selling loans and real estate
once owned by failed S&amp;Ls.
   Congress authorized the extra borrowing, but Sen. Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the banking committee, said $25
billion was far more than envisioned.
   So far, the RTC has run through $20 billion: $1.8 billion to
close 24 small S&amp;Ls, $8.3 billion to handle five large institutions
by next week and five smaller not-yet-completed deals, $8.5 billion
to replace high-cost deposits and $1.4 billion as a reserve fund to
handle liquidity problems at thrifts that have failed but are still
open, Seidman said.
   Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson said the inability to
close the five big cases by Sept. 30, the last day of fiscal 1989,
means the reported federal budget deficit will be about $8 billion
higher in fiscal 1990.
   However, he said that would not trigger automatic spending cuts
under the Gramm-Rudman law. The 1990 budget estimate taken for
determining those cuts was made on Aug. 15, he said.
   Meanwhile, both Brady and Seidman reassured committee members,
alarmed by the scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, that they are working to prevent similar abuses from
developing at the RTC.
   ``I think we've learned from the mistakes of the past,'' added
Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, a member of Brady's oversight panel.
   Seidman said the RTC last week issued an interim ethics code
governing the thousands of independent contractors it is expected
to hire to manage the real estate and other assets it is inheriting
from the thrifts.
   Both Brady and Seidman said the RTC and the oversight panel
chaired by Brady were working well together despite initial
tensions.
   ``No joint enterprise of any magnitude is without its healthy
frictions, and ours is no exception,'' Brady said. ``But overall we
have gotten off to an excellent start.''
   At a separate hearing held by a 17-member House Banking task
force, Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., complained about RTC projections
that it would swell from 1,150 employees currently to between 5,000
and 10,000.
   ``No one intended this legislation to create a big bureaucracy.
... (That's) the last thing in the world I want,'' he said.
   RTC Executive Director David C. Cooke said his agency likely
will handle in excess of $300 billion assets, about a third of that
difficult to sell. If the RTC eventually has as many as 10,000
employees, that's only one employee managing every $10 million in
assets, he said.

<TEXT>
   United Airlines' largest union, the
Machinists, on Wednesday formally rejected an offer to join the
proposed $6.75 billion pilot-management buyout of United's parent
company.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers had repeatedly expressed its opposition to the proposed
leveraged buyout of Chicago-based UAL Corp. by its employees and
management, saying it could endanger the nation's second-largest
airline. But it had not issued a formal answer until the
announcement from vice president John Peterpaul.
   ``After a thorough study of the proposed plan and after meeting
with company officials, the IAM will go forth with normal
negotiations as it would with any other carrier,'' Peterpaul said.
``We do not feel that IAM members' interest would be well served by
participating in the ESOP (employee stock ownership plan) program.''
   The Machinists union represents 25,000 of UAL's 70,000
employees. Its contract becomes amendable at the end of this month.
   United said in a statement that the Machinists' decision was
consistent with its ``previously announced and often repeated
position.''
   But the company said the IAM decision ``does not change the
benefits that flow to United's employees from ownership of their
company _ benefits we hope will be shared by all employees.''
   And the company indicated it would continue to woo Machinists
members, saying ``we would welcome the participation of our
employees represented by the IAM, and are prepared to continue to
explore ways to achieve that objective.''
   The $300-a-share plan calls for UAL workers to own 75 percent of
the company. A management group headed by UAL Chairman Stephen M.
Wolf would own 10 percent and the remaining 15 percent would be
held by British Airways PLC.
   The total cost of the buyout, including financing charges, could
reach $9.45 billion, according to documents filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission by pilots and management.

   Stock prices reached record highs for the second
straight session Wednesday, riding the latest wave of the powerful
advance that began almost a year ago.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.53 to
2,771.09, stretching its gain since the start of the week to 78.27
points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
831 up, 656 down and 506 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 194.59 million
shares, up from 182.55 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 231.99 million shares.
   Analysts noted some ``catch-up'' buying by investors who were
caught off guard by the market's rerurgent rally this week.
   The new advance in stock prices was attributed in large measure
to persistent strength in the dollar and declining interest rates.
   Talk began stirring in the financial world early this week that
the Federal Reserve might soon find room to relax its credit policy
further, prompted by slow-to-moderate economic growth and favorable
inflation news.
   Interest rates levelled off in the credit markets Wednesday. But
after hesitating for the first two hours of the session, stocks
began forging ahead again.
   Since last Nov. 16, when the Dow Jones industrials settled back
to 2,038.58, the average has soared 732.51 points, or 35.93 percent.
   USX, the day's most active issue, made a big contribution to the
Dow's gain with a 2{ rise to 38}. Financier Carl Icahn, who owns
about 11 percent of the company, was widely rumored to be
increasing his stake in a move to enhance the return on his
investment.
   International Business Machines gained 2\ to 108\, rebounding
from a recent slide that greeted disappointing earnings news from
the company.
   Elsewhere among the blue chips, Eastman Kodak rose 1 to 48};
General Electric ] to 58~; Procter &amp; Gamble 1[ to 125}, and United
Technologies \ to 56}.
   But McDonald's, faced with heightened price competition in the
fast-food business, dropped { to 30.
   Microsoft climbed 6{ to 75{ in the over-the-counter market. The
company said it expects to report a 34 percent revenue increase for
its fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 30.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $19.11 billion, or
0.55 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.14 to 197.98.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.60 to 407.04, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.23 at 356.94.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
2.04 to 479.32. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 394.36, up 1.34.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Goldsmith Bid To Block Review of BAT Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Sir James Goldsmith lost another round
Wednesday in his attempt to block state regulators from reviewing
his $21.1 billion bid for BAT Industries PLC, the British parent of
Farmer's Group Insurance Inc. and several U.S. retailers.
   U.S. District Judge John A. Nordberg refused to block the
Illinois insurance director's review of the hostile takeover
attempt, said Farmers spokesman Jeffrey Beyer.
   Los Angeles-based Farmers, the 15th-largest insurance holding
company in the United States, operates in nine states. Insurance
regulators in those states are reviewing BAT's proposed takeover to
assure it is in the best interest of policyholders.
   Federal judges in California, Idaho, Kansas, Texas and
Washington have denied similar requests by Goldsmith's company,
Holyake Investments, for preliminary injunctions blocking review in
those states.
   Goldsmith contends state regulators have no constitutional right
to review a foreign takeover. His spokesmen have said he intends to
appeal the rulings.
   As part of Goldsmith's proposal, Farmers Group would be sold to
Ax Midi Assurance, a large French insurer, for $4.5 billion.

   Two former researchers at a Johnson &amp;
Johnson subsidiary have charged the company withheld vital
information about a painkiller that was linked to severe reactions
and at least nine deaths before it was pulled from the market in
1983.
   In a lawsuit filed in state Superior Court in New Brunswick, the
former McNeil Pharmaceutical division researchers allege Johnson &amp;
Johnson engaged in ``a corporate conspiracy to get drugs on the
market even if they were medically inadequate'' and to ``maximize
sales of the same regardless of consequences.''
   Dr. Edward Lemanowicz, McNeil's former assistant director of
regulatory affairs, and Dr. James Dale, former assistant director
of medical research, also contend they were forced out of McNeil
for refusing to take part in the alleged coverup.
   Zomax, a prescription painkiller developed in the 1970s, was
pulled from the market in March 1983 after more than 2,000 reports
of violent reactions and at least nine deaths.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson, based in New Brunswick, issued a one-page
statement Wednesday that refuted the accusations.
   ``Zomax was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 1983
because of an increase in reports of allergic reactions,'' it said.
   ``There is no basis for their charge that Johnson &amp; Johnson and
McNeil Pharmaceutical falsified or delayed reporting any data about
Zomax or any other drug,'' the statement said. ``Both of these
former employees were treated with respect and consideration by
McNeil and neither was asked to say or do anything inconsistent
with the highest professional standards.''
   Allan Kanner, an attorney representing the researchers, said his
clients sued because practices that allowed Zomax to be approved by
the Food and Drug Administration and mass marketed despite
potentially deadly side effects were never reformed.
   ``This is not a suit solely about Zomax,'' he said. ``This goes
to the nature of what a corporation does. The reality is that the
people who get promoted there are the people who care more about
the result of sales than protecting the public's health.''
   Kanner said Dale, a physician who objected several times during
the drug's development and the FDA approval process, was concerned
that testing was insufficient, that evidence of possible long-term
kidney damage was discounted by the company and that warning labels
for prescribing doctors were insufficient.
   Once on the market, the suit alleges, McNeil mishandled and
understated telephone reports of adverse reactions that were made
to the drug maker.
   Kanner said Dale took several calls about patients who
reportedly died after taking Zomax.
   He said Dale's superiors at Johnson &amp; Johnson rewrote the
reports to hide the severity of the reported reactions and then
destroyed Dale's source notes. The reports were then sent to the
FDA.
   Kanner said neither of his clients was fired but instead ``were
sent into a kind of corporate Siberia.'' He said the doctors were
seeking compensation for lost wages, lost tenure and possible
punitive damages.
