   Early unofficial returns Wednesday
night showed conservative Fernando Collor de Mello leading Brazil's
first free and direct presidential election since 1960.
   With about 8 percent of the votes counted, Collor de Mello, who
led most exit polls with 30 percent, had 2,225,909 votes, followed
by left-wing populist Leonel Brizola with 1,628,735 votes, said
Globo TV, the nation's largest network.
   Late Wednesday the government announced a 12-hour delay in the
official count, reportedly because of computer problems.
   In third place was Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the
Marxist-oriented Workers' Party with 1,561,739 votes, trailed by
Sen. Mario Covas of the left-of-center Brazilian Social Democracy
Party with 1,345,248 votes but with surprising leads in two of the
country's largest cities, the network said.
   Covas, a dark-horse candidate, held a strong lead in Sao Paulo,
the nation's most populous city, and was a solid second in Belo
Horizonte, the TV network said.
   The network said some 130,000 people voted for popular TV
game-show host Silvio Santos, who tried to enter the race two weeks
before the election but whose candidacy was thrown out by the
Electoral Court.
   More than 82 million people were eligible to vote for a
successor to President Jose Sarney, who was chosen by an electoral
college when the generals relinquished power in 1985 after two
decades' rule. Voting was mandatory for Brazilians aged 18-69.
   The chief of Brazil's federal police, Romeu Tuma, said there
were ``no significant incidents to mar the voting. We are very
pleased with how calm the day was.''
   Final results are not expected until Saturday and, on the
assumption no one gains a majority, a runoff between the two
leaders is planned for Dec. 17.
   The first official results announced were from a relative
handful of Brazilians who cast ballots in embassies and consulates
in 19 countries, with Collor de Mello leading followed by Covas and
da Silva.
   Collor de Mello, a 40-year-old former state governor, has been a
harsh critic of Sarney. Leading in the polls since April, his
dapper good looks and anti-corruption platform made Collor de Mello
popular with the poor, a majority in the Brazilian electorate.
   Sarney is widely blamed for official corruption and an annual
inflation rate of at least 1,300 percent.
   The Superior Electoral Court first announced results would start
being released at 8:00 p.m. local time, just three hours after the
polls closed. However, that time was pushed back to 11:00 p.m. and
then to Thursday.
   An election official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told a
reporter there was a problem with computer links between Brasilia
and far-off voting precincts.
   Parties ranged from the Communists to one formerly backed by the
military entered candidates.
   Fully 73 percent of the Brazilian electorate had never voted for
president. Lines lines of voters began forming before dawn, hours
before polls opened at 8 a.m., from the Amazon jungle in the north
to the southern pampas.
   The results showed the candidates leading in their regional
strongholds _ Collor de Mello led in the federal capital of
Brasilia, in northeastern Maceio and southeastern Curitiba.
   Da Silva, an ex-labor leader, held wide leads in southeastern
Belo Horizonte and the two northeastern Atlantic coastal cities of
Salvador and Recife.
   Brizola, of the Democratic Labor Party, led in the southern
capital cities of Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's
second-largest city.
   Promotional spots on nationwide television said that whereas in
1960 it took three months to count the votes, this year, with
modern computer technology, the results would be announced as
quickly as possible.
   The federal electoral court promised results by 8 p.m. but that
was postponed several times for reasons not explained.
   Election officials directed that ballots cast at the 250,000
voting stations in the nation's 4,445 counties be flown to Brasilia
after local counting.
   Several candidates raised the possibility of fraud. Roberto
Rosas of the Superior Electoral Court responded on Wednesday:
   ``Many candidates are setting up parallel vote-counting, for
fear of fraud, but fraud is impossibe and there is no `virus' or
`microbe' that can affect our computers.''
   Collor de Mello voted early in Maceio and flew back to Brasilia
to follow the count for president, who will serve five years and
cannot seek re-election.
   The election took place on a national holiday, the 100th
anniversary of the republic that ended the reign of Emperor Pedro
II.
   In Rio, many Brizola sympathizers wore red bandannas, the
candidate's trademark. In Brasilia, election officials delayed
voting for two hours and ordered the bandannas removed.
   The penalty for not voting is a fine of up to 20 new cruzados,
about $3.30.
   A 1988 constitutional reform also enfranchised citizens aged 16
and 17, but voting is not compulsory for them.
   Liquor sales were forbidden from midnight Tuesday to 6 a.m.
Thursday.
   Janio Quadros won Brazil's last free and direct presidential
election, in 1960. He resigned after seven months and the ensuing
confusion led to a military coup in 1964.
   The army canceled direct presidential elections, although they
permitted some regional elections.
   Sarney, 59, said this election ``concludes the transition to
democracy.''
   ``There has never been so much freedom in the country,'' he said
Tuesday night. ``In homes, at work, in the streets, opinions are
divided and no one is afraid, because we know democracy exists.''
   He did not publicly support any candidate, and described his
role in the election as a ``magistrate.''

<TEXT>
   Members of Congress have written to President
Bush asking about industry reports that the administration plans
heavy cuts in research in high technology financed through the
Defense Department, a congressional aide said Wednesday night.
   A White House spokesman, Steven Hart, said he was not sure the
letter had been received and could give no response. ``I have
nothing for you on that,'' said Hart.
   Among the signers of the letter were Reps. Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., the Democratic majority leader in the House, and Rep. Mel
Levine, D-Calif., according to Michael Wessel, an aide to Gephardt.
   An aide who spoke on condition that he not be identified said
sources in the semiconductor industry with access to classified
documents had been alerting congressional offices to what they
described as an administration plan for sharp cuts.
   Among programs that might be affected, he said, were Sematech,
the consortium now conducting semiconductor research with the aid
of $100 million in federal money every year; a planned program in
X-Ray lithography that could increase the capacity of computer
chips, and high-definition television or HDTV.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher lost a bid in September
inside the administration to launch a major effort to capture world
leadership in HDTV.
   As the aide described the letter, the members were ``asking
information about what they heard about possible cuts in high-tech
research and urging that no cuts be made.''

   Peace talks between Nicaragua's leftist
government and the Contra rebels fell into disarray Wednesday night
with the two sides offering sharply differing assessments on the
progress of the negotiations.
   The Contra delegation stunned the Sandinista negotiators in
early evening by asking for a week-long recess just when,
Sandinista officials said, an agreement seemed within reach.
   The chief Nicaraguan government negotiator, Vice-Foreign
Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco, described the Contra proposal as ``a
total surprise'' because he said the two sides had made ``a lot of
progress'' earlier in the day.
   The talks took a bizarre twist when, according to Tinoco, the
Contra delegation disappeared at 8 p.m. after members said they
wanted to talk among themselves.
   ``We don't know where they are,'' Tinoco told reporters shortly
after 10 p.m. ``They are somewhere in this building.''
   Tinoco and other members of the Sandinista delegation then
returned to their hotel.
   An hour later, the Contra delegation reappeared and told
reporters they planned to return late Thursday morning to discuss
with the Sandinistas the timing for the resumption of the
negotiations.
   They left the impression that they might rescind their earlier
request for a seven-day recess.
   Earlier, rebel spokesman Bosco Matamoros disagreed strongly when
he was informed that an American member of the Sandinista
delegation, Paul Reichler, had given an upbeat account of the
discussions.
   ``Unfortunately there was not any flexibility on the part of the
government to reach a cease-fire,'' Matamoros said.
   Informed that Reichler had said that the two sides were on the
verge of an agreement, Matamoros replied, ``I would say Mr.
Rickler's perception is not accurate.''
   Still earlier, Tinoco said his government offered a major
concession in cease-fire talks with the Contras by dropping its
demand that the rebels demobilize.
   As its price for restoring the cease-fire the government allowed
to lapse Nov. 1, Tinoco said the government is insisting only that
Contra forces in Nicaragua return to their base camps in Honduras.
   ``We think that is a very important change in our position,''
Tinoco told a news conference at the Nicaraguan Embassy a few hours
before the peace talks reconvened at the Organization of American
States.
   Tinoco maintained that while the Sandinistas are willing to make
concessions, the Contras have shown ``not an inch of flexibility''
in four rounds of talks starting last Thursday at the United
Nations.
   There was no immediate response by the rebels but administration
officials said the Contras have told them evacuation from
Nicaraguan territory is not feasible.
   As part of a cease-fire agreement, the rebels would be willing
instead to relocate in designated ``enclaves'' in Nicaragua where
their activities could easily be monitored by international
observers, the Contras have told U.S. officials.
   If they return to Honduras, it is possible they could be
prevented by international monitors from returning to Nicaragua,
the Contras have argued.
   In addition, they said, since the Contras are Nicaraguans, it
makes more sense for them to remain inside their own homeland
rather than in a neighboring country.
   There are an estimated 5,000 rebels in Nicaragua, about 2,000 of
whom have infiltrated from the Honduran base camps in recent weeks.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega declined to renew the cease
fire on Nov. 1, drawing widespread international condemnation.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Monday that the
suspension of the truce had created ``a militarized election
atmosphere.'' Ortega defended his decision by saying the rebels had
been engaging in terrorist activity.
   While allowing the truce to lapse after 19 months, Ortega
simultaneously called for a resumption of discussions with the
resistance.
   Hoping to prod the negotiators toward a settlement were
representatives from the United Nations and the Organization of
American States. They are members of the International Commission
for Support and Verification, which was set up to oversee the peace
process.

   President Bush called El Salvador's president
Wednesday to express solidarity with the rightist government in the
face of a fierce guerrilla attack that has left upwards of 500
people dead and more than 1,000 wounded.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush commended
President Alfredo Cristiani for the efforts of the Salvadoran armed
forces ``to avoid causing casualties to the civilian population.''
   The spokesman said Bush also pledged the United States would
continue to speak out about Cuban and Nicaraguan support for the
guerrillas, ``which flies in the face'' of regional peace accords.
   The four-day-guerrilla offensive appeared stalled as government
troops drove the rebels from working-class neighborhoods in fierce
combat. The armed forces' air power and numerical superiority
combined with lack of popular support for the guerrillas appeared
to tilt the battle for the capital in favor of the government.
   In Friday editions, The New York Times said U.S. officials were
accelerating deliveries of munitions and other aid scheduled for
delivery to El Salvador.
   Fitzwater said Bush told Cristiani he stands behind the
Salvadoran government. ``The president said that the (rebel force)
bears full responsibility for this tragedy and that he wanted to
express the solidarity of the American people for the great
suffering in Sal Salvador and elsewhere.''
   The press spokesman said Cristiani thanked Bush for his support
and reported that the armed forces were having increasing success
against the guerrillas.
   Further, Cristiani told Bush that the government ``would
continue to give the highest priority to protecting the civilian
population in military operations against those guerrillas that
remained,'' Fitzwater said.

   The nation's oldest air passenger service, whose
seaplanes carried celebrities, outlaws and at least one fleeing
dictator in its 70 years, may be grounded by financial losses and
competition from modern jets.
   Unless a buyer is found, the final island-hopping Chalk's
International Airlines' flight will splash down Dec. 15 on Biscayne
Bay off Miami.
   ``It's a very sad moment. This is an item of living history that
may bite the dust,'' said Harold Rifas, an attorney for financially
troubled Resorts International Inc., which has owned Chalk's since
1974.
   ``It was an exciting, thrilling way to move people,'' said
Rifas. ``It's really a depressing thing for me to handle this.''
   Rifas said losses have been ``very, very substantial'' at
Chalk's, whose 17-seat seaplanes were featured on the opening
credits of the former hit series ``Miami Vice.''
   Resorts reported losses of $2.3 million for the first half of
1989 for its airline operations, including Chalk's and Paradise
Island Airlines, which carries travelers to Resorts' Bahamian
casino complex.
   Chalk's dropped its Paradise Island route last month and now
operates three daily flights between Miami and the Bahamian island
of Bimini.
   Resorts itself is struggling with mounting debt and falling
values of junk bonds used by Merv Griffin to finance acquisition of
the company from developer Donald Trump last year.
   The possible demise of Chalk's would end a direct link with
Miami's flamboyant past as a mecca for such pioneer aviators as
Amelia Earhart, Eastern Airlines founder Eddie Rickenbaker, Pan
American Airways founder Juan Trippe and Glenn Curtiss of Curtiss
Aviation.
   In 1919, barnstormer and stunt pilot Arthur ``Pappy'' Chalk took
a Curtiss F flying boat to Miami and tied up along the bayfront,
where he pitched an umbrella and began offering $5 sightseeing
flights.
   During the next decades, Chalk's Caribbean island flights
carried everyone from sunburned tourists to shady Prohibition-era
rumrunners. Passenger manifests also included names such as Ernest
Hemingway and Errol Flynn.
   In 1933, a hail of bullets followed a Chalk's plane whisking
deposed Cuban dictator Geraldo Machado into exile.
   In 1972, a Chalk's crewman and pilot were wounded by two gunmen
who commandeered an aircraft to Cuba. The crew and passengers
returned to Miami the next day.
   Five years later, 88-year-old Chalk died after falling from a
tree he was trimming.
   The only accident involving a Chalk's aircraft and resulting in
an injury occurred in 1985, when a Grumman Mallard crashed after
takeoff from Cat Cay south of Bimini. One the 12 passengers was
injured.
   ``When you talk about amphibious aircraft you are going back to
the origins of international air travel,'' said Donna Corbett at
the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington. ``It's
really a look back to the beginnings.''
   The museum is exhibiting a former Chalk's Grumman Goose, the
forerunner of the Mallards now operated by the airline.
   Ms. Corbett said 63-year-old Northwest Airlines in Eagan, Minn.,
outside Minneapolis, is officially the nation's oldest passenger
``airline,'' a designation that requires posted schedules and a
federal license.
   But she said Chalk's, which received airline status in the 1940s
after years without firm, posted schedules, may lay claim to being
the oldest passenger ``service'' and the last surviving scheduled
seaplane operation in the United States.
   Catalina Flying Boats discontinued seaplane service last year
from Long Beach, Calif., to Catalina Island.
   Like other seaplane services, Chalk's has been unable to compete
with faster and larger jets.
   Several airlines, including Pan Am, Eastern and Midway Airlines,
have service to the Bahamas. Paradise Island Airlines now uses
50-seat Dash 7 planes to its private airstrip.
   Resorts reported it lost $48.5 million for the first six months
of 1989 on revenue of $223.7 million.

   A ``little half-pint'' size waitress pregnant
with twins chased and helped catch a man who police say stabbed one
of her regular customers at the restaurant.
   ``I didn't know what I was going to do if I caught him,'' said
Karen Hoyle, who is 4{ months pregnant and just shy of 5 feet tall.
   She didn't have to worry because her screams during Tuesday
afternoon's four-block chase alerted a police officer, who caught
the man.
   The 49-year-old suspect, a drifter from Montana, was being held
pending a charge of aggravated robbery, said Paul Adelmann, a St.
Paul police spokesman.
   The victim, 86-year-old Bernard Young, who was in fair condition
Tuesday night following surgery at St. Paul Ramsey Medical Center,
identified the man as his attacker, said police and hospital
officials.
   Young stumbled out of a restroom at Tin Cup's Place in St. Paul
after he was attacked.
   ``He kind of fell into my arms and said he had been stabbed and
mugged,'' said a cook, Carolyn Lenihan, 45.
   Ms. Hoyle asked which way the attacker had gone.
   ``That's when she took off, the little half pint and her
twins,'' said Mrs. Lenihan, who added she didn't have time to stop
Ms. Hoyle.
   ``It was just an instant reaction to get this guy,'' said Ms.
Hoyle, 24.
   She said when she spotted the man outside, he was walking
casually, until she started screaming at him.
   A restaurant patron joined her in the chase but he couldn't keep
up, she said.
   She said once police caught the suspect, ``I looked at him in
the car and said I hope you didn't kill this guy. He just glared at
me. He never said anything to me. He didn't have a chance. I was
screaming the whole time.''
   She returned to the restaurant in time to tell Young the suspect
was in custody and help Young's wife into the ambulance to join him.
   After that, she went back to waiting tables.
   ``That's Karen. It's like the show must go on,'' Mrs. Lenihan
said.

<TEXT>
   Penthouse magazine sued a religious organization in
federal court Tuesday, accusing the group of using extortion and
racketeering to suppress the sale of adult magazines.
   The lawsuit filed in U.S District Court names the Florida
chapter of the American Family Association. It seeks to recover at
least $25,000 the magazine claims it lost when a grocery store
chain stopped selling Penthouse, according to a statement from
Penthouse International.
   A similar lawsuit was filed against the association two weeks
ago by retailing and publishing companies, including Playboy
magazine and the Waldenbooks book store chain.
   ``These people represent the worst possible element in a free
society,'' Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione said in the statement.
``They will not rest until the public, through its inaction, allows
them to regulate and approve our reading, viewing, listening and
other educational and entertainment activities.''
   A call late Tuesday to the group's state headquarters in Tampa
seeking comment was not immediately returned. A home phone number
for the group's state director, David Caton, was unlisted.
   The lawsuit accuses the association and Caton of distributing a
letter in September to store chains ``threatening them with legal
action and public ridicule unless they agreed to stop selling the
magazines,'' the statement said.
   The letter claimed the stores were violating Florida's obscenity
statute and promised to name those stores as violators and demand
enforcement.
   The publishing companies have said the statute applies only to
publishers. The association acknowledged in a news release that was
included in the earlier lawsuit that the pornography statute
applies only to publishing companies.
   The association has campaigned for years against the sale of
magazines such as Penthouse and Playboy. The association, which has
also backed boycotts of TV programs it considers offensive, most
recently persuaded Matchbox to cancel sale of a Freddy Krueger
doll, based on the ghoulish killer in ``Nightmare on Elm Street''
movies.

   Senior editors at East Germany's state news agency
used to dread the daily phone call from the Communist Party Central
Committee, telling them what to write. Such calls are just a memory
now.
   ``Nobody tells us what to report and what not to report
anymore,'' said Ralf Bachmann, assistant director general of the
ADN news agency. ``It's as if someone had removed the brakes on
us.''
   Bachmann, 59, and others said Tuesday that decades of
restrictions on reporting have been lifted over the last three
weeks in the course of radical changes that toppled the hard-line
leadership of Erich Honecker and culminated in the opening of the
Berlin Wall.
   Bachmann says he sees ADN evolving from a mouthpiece of the
Communist Party into a non-partisan news service ``that is there
for all readers, for all parties, for all newspapers.''
   Acting Chief Editor Hans-Joachim Koppe of the daily Neue Zeit
also perceives the news media moving toward ``a real pluralism of
opinions and parties,'' after shaking off constraints that resulted
in some of the world's most slanted and boring reporting.
   His paper is run by the Christian Democratic Union _ one of four
parties allowed to survive after the Communist Party assumed sole
control in 1949 in exchange for acknowledging Communist supremacy.
   For decades, that tradeoff was reflected in Neue Zeit's
reporting. With the exception of sports on the last page, the
eight-page edition on Oct. 9 was devoted to celebrations of East
Germany's 40th anniversary and the visit of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   A headline from that edition: ``The Idea of Socialism Becomes
More Enriched and is Conducive to Joint Action.''
   Since then, East Germany's peaceful revolution has swept Neue
Zeit's pages clean of such subservience.
   ``The Issue is True Pluralism, of Letting the People Decide,''
read one front-page headline. ``Ninety-Three Percent (of
Respondents) Want a New Election Law,'' read another.
   An editorial criticized the Communists in a way that would have
been unthinkable just three weeks ago, urging ``those who are
guilty to be made accountable to the people.''
   ``It is just that party leaders and ministers are made
accountable to us,'' the editorial continued. ``It is just when
property and privileges gained illegally are confiscated. One
should be made to take responsibility for political mistakes. And
crimes have to be punished.''
   State television also isn't what it used to be. Over the past
three weeks:
   _Chief editor Klaus Schickhelm of the main news program went on
the air to apologize to the public for biased and false reporting
and pledged ``quick and honest'' news presentation.
   _``The Black Canal,'' a rabidly anti-West propaganda program
that enraged East Germans for nearly 30 years, was abruptly
canceled.
   _A Parliament session was transmitted live for the first time,
giving viewers a chance to see suddenly enlivened legislators call
for free elections and criticize the Communist leadership.
   Such changes are appreciated by East Germans, many of whom used
to watch West German television to get a feel of what was happening
in their country and the world.
   ``I never used to watch the Aktuelle Kamera,'' taxi driver Frank
Schimansky said of the main evening news show. ``But now, I watch
it all the time, because I find it keeps me better informed about
what is happening here than West German TV does.''
   The new-found boldness in reporting also has made reading the
newspaper more rewarding.
   ``I used to be through the newspaper in five minutes,'' said the
46-year-old Schimansky, as he dropped off a passenger near the
Checkpoint Charlie crossing point to the West. ``Now, I need about
two hours.''

<TEXT>
   In the grimy birthplace of East
Germany's peaceful revolution, the opening of the Berlin Wall was a
bittersweet victory for the opposition.
   ``We're really afraid of a sellout to West Germany,'' said Falk
Hocquel, a leader of Leipzig's branch of New Forum, the biggest
opposition group.
   ``This opening of the border came too quickly, it was chaotic,''
Hocquel said. ``We see a real danger that the big firms move in
here and East Germany becomes the poorhouse of Western Europe. Our
people will go and work illegally in West Germany for six months to
get hard currency, then come back. We have no interest in being
bought out by big business.''
   Hocquel's ideals strike a chord among many in this polluted
industrial center, East Germany's second-largest city and the
throbbing heart of its astounding popular revolt.
   Many East Germans are proud of what they have achieved in 40
years of communism and are uneasy at the thought of being taken
over by their rich brothers in the West.
   In recent weeks, they have been strongly politicized, but ``they
are nonetheless susceptible to Western wealth. This economically
strong nation is our great danger,'' Hocquel said.
   The opposition thus counted it a victory that, after a weekend
in which 3 million East Germans went West _ many for the first time
in 28 years, at least 200,000 marched in Leipzig Monday night to
demand free elections and shout anti-Communist slogans.
   But the real test of popular belief in New Forum as a political
movement will come Saturday, when the group is host to East
Germany's first legal opposition assembly on Leipzig's market
square.
   ``Before the opening of the borders, I would have said half a
million people would come,'' Hocquel said. ``Now, I don't know. I
hope at least 300,000.''
   New Forum, formed only in September as a national movement, has
said it plans to contest the free elections promised by the
Communists and due in 1991.
   But the group, which is far more organized in Leipzig than in
East Berlin, is trying to put the brake on calls for a vote next
spring. It argues that fall 1990 is the earliest point it and other
parties could stand on meaningful platforms.
   To a foreigner, the call for an orderly, slower reform may sound
typically German. To East Germans baffled by the stunning changes
of one short month, it sounds like a sensible breathing space and a
chance to avoid mistakes.
   Reunification, they feel, should not be high on the political
agenda.
   ``That's not a theme until the people here have really created
something new,'' said Christian Fuehrer, vicar of the Nikolai
church whose weekly prayers for peace became the kernel of a mass
pro-democracy demonstration.
   ``For 40 years,'' Fuehrer said, ``our identity was only three
initials _ DDR (East Germany).
   ``Now, we have to learn our history which for years in schools
here started with the revolution in the Soviet Union in 1917. We
must know what is German. Then, maybe you can talk about
reunification. But it's not something that can just be ordered,
then administered. We've seen where that led for 40 years.''
   The deep disillusionment with four decades of false promises and
hardship comes through far more strongly in Leipzig than in East
Berlin.
   ``Pure frustration drove these people onto the streets,'' said
Uwe Dreilich, 32, a Communist Party member who has taken part in
every Monday demonstration of the past two months.
   ``People were simply sick of being told what to do in every
little thing,'' Dreilich said.
   Leipzig added a special factor to that despair. As second city,
it has always had a great rivalry with Berlin and resented the
resources poured into the capital and denied the provinces.
Residents complain of polluted air and decrepit, peeling buildings.
   Side by side with a vibrant intellectual community are hundreds
of thousands of workers toiling in outdated, polluting factories
and thoroughly discontent with the rewards.
   ``For 28 years, we allowed ourselves to be oppressed,'' said
Maria Mueller, 43, from a small town outside Leipzig. She has been
marching for more democracy for the past eight Mondays.
   ``They exploited us,'' she said of the Communists. ``They
grumble about capitalism, but they are much worse. And when I saw
the police lined up here Oct. 9, I thought we got another 1938
(when the Nazis assumed power). The only difference was the
uniforms.''
   Such strong sentiments feed opposition hopes that the peaceful
revolution can achieve much more than last weekend's massive
East-West border bash.
   ``After 40 years in the ghetto, the lid is off, and of course
the people want out,'' Fuehrer said.
   ``But for me as a churchman, things like the promise to an
alternative to military service, something we fought for for 28
years, are more important than drinking beer on the Kudamm,'' he
said, referring to West Berlin's main street.
   ``The beer goes, but these real changes remain. Every hand and
thinking head is needed here now.''

<HEAD>Open Borders Mean New Economic Hazards for Both Germanys</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The opening of East Germany's borders has exposed
troubling economic hazards for both Germanys.
   The sight of millions of East Germans visiting West Berlin gives
a hint of the onslaught that could result if living standards fail
to rise to meet the growing expectations of East Germans.
   East Germany fears being further impoverished by West Germans
using hard-currency clout to buy up property or subsidized goods in
an accessible Eastern market.
   But Deutsche Bank chairman Alfred Herrhausen predicts that with
market-oriented reforms, ``I'm convinced that East Germany can
reach our Western living standards within the next five to 10
years.''
   Herrhausen's forecast and Bonn's promise of massive aid in the
style of the postwar Marshall Plan demonstrate the strength of West
German interest in rebuilding the East German economy.
   But even with the best of intentions, the East German problems
may be insurmountable.
   East Germans can rarely be reached by phone from the West
because the hopelessly insufficient network is subject to
breakdowns and equipment shortages.
   Consumers wait years to buy smoke-spewing Trabant and Wartburg
cars that are the butt of jokes in West Germany, where the wheels
of preference are the luxury Mercedes and BMW.
   Fresh fruit is seldom more than a memory in winter.
Refrigerators, TVs and VCRs can cost several months' salary and
break down two weeks later.
   Euphoria over travel freedom could quickly give way to
frustration as East Germans discover firsthand the vast difference
between their meager, burdened lifestyles and the prosperity of
Western neighbors.
   And West Germany's constitutionally mandated practice of
granting citizenship to ethnic Germans keeps the door wide open to
permanent settlement in the West.
   More than 200,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany this
year, emptied of hope their nation could ever provide them with the
life available next door.
   The deluge has ebbed considerably since the Stalinist controls
on travel fell Thursday, but Bonn recognizes the risks involved if
reforms should fail.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann on Tuesday offered an aid
package for East Germany if the new leadership converts to a market
system. But a leading East German economist, Karl Morgenstern, said
a free-market system is not the goal of his socialist state.
   Reform-oriented leaders in East Berlin have not indicated how or
when they will consider the critical step toward conversion to a
hard-currency system. Even the most optimistic economists doubt a
convertible East German mark could be achieved before the end of
the century.
   Because the state needs to generate enough hard currency to buy
priority equipment and commodities, it is forced to sell goods for
export at only 15 percent of the cost of production, Finance
Minister Ernst Hoefner disclosed Monday.
   Limited hard currency also puts up an effective ban on travel to
the West in the place of the physical one removed.
   ``In principle the people are free to travel, but in reality
without the funds to do so they are still behind the barriers,''
said Manfred Milzer, an economist with the West German federal
Institute for Economics Research.
   He said the West German government must kick in billions of
marks to a travel fund to take the pressure off East Berlin while
it reforms industries.
   Major West German firms have long eyed the potential for joint
ventures, but most plans hinge on changes that are to far from
socialist principles to be acceptable to the East German
authorities.
   Erwin Flick of Siemens' Berlin division said the electronics
giant would love to work with East Germany to revamp the antiquated
phone system.
   ``But the conditions that have long hindered investment remain.
Absolutely nothing in a legal or economic sense has changed,''
Flick said.
   On the side of optimism, however, the automotive giant
Daimler-Benz plans to send a delegation to East Germany within a
few days to discuss the prospects for joint production of passenger
cars, said spokesman Matthias Kleinert in Stuttgart.
   Some investors fear the exodus of young workers _ a body blow to
the already labor-short state _ further damages the prospect for
improving productivity.
   ``East Germany already had a critical demographic problem of an
over-aged population, and the refugees have sharpened this
development,'' said Wolfgang Stinglwagner, an economist with the
Inter-German Affairs Institute in Bonn.
   Hoefner, the East Berlin finance minister, disclosed the
national debt was the equivalent of more than $70 billion, worse
than Western economists had imagined.
   East German officials and opposition activists alike have
expressed fears that a hard-currency hunger could result in a
two-class system in East Germany: those with foreign money and
those without.
   West German marks already command the best goods on the
shortage-plagued market, and East Germans are worried they could be
``bought out'' unless customs controls are invoked.
   Prime real estate in central Berlin may be opened up on the East
side if the Communist government dismantles the Berlin Wall's
security zone. That could ease the shortage of building land in
both sectors of Berlin.
   But the East has too little money to embark on major new capital
investments, and Western investors still lack the confidence in the
stability of East German reforms to commit funds for construction.

   In a dispatch Nov. 2, The Associated
Press identified 15 ethnic Albanians on trial in Kosovo province as
``separatists'' but neglected to attribute the term to certain
authorities.
   The 15, who include former Kosovo Communist Party leader Azem
Vlasi, are charged with ``counterrevolutionary activities'' in
connection with ethnic Albanian protests in Kosovo.
   The term separatists has been applied to the 15 by some
authorities in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia, of which Kosovo is
part, who claim the ethnic Albanians sought to make the province
part of neighboring Albania. The term should have been attributed
to those authorities.
   About 85 percent of Kosovo's population are Albanians and most
are described as favoring a restoration of the autonomy the claim
they lost with recent constitutional changes. But there is no
evidence that the majority favors separating from Yugoslavia to
become part of Albania.

   Actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg turned 40
and became a grandmother _ all in one day.
   Her 15-year-old daughter, Alexandria Martin, gave birth Monday
to a 6-pound, 15-ounce girl at a hospital in Berkeley, Calif., said
Brad Cafarelli, Miss Goldberg's publicist.
   Miss Goldberg was at her daughter's side when Amarah Skye Martin
came into the world, said Cafarelli.
   ``They are all doing fine,'' he said.
   Last month, Miss Goldberg said she thought the decision of her
unmarried daughter to have a baby was ``the absolute wrong thing.''
   But she said she was happy that her daughter was ``confident
enough in me to tell me'' that she was pregnant.
   Miss Goldberg's disclosure came on ``The Joan Rivers Show,''
according to a news release from the talk show's producers.
   Miss Goldberg, nominated for an Academy Award for her role in
``The Color Purple,'' recently finished the movie ``Ghost'' with
Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore.

   The other actresses performed risque, off-camera
gags to make Dolly Parton laugh during a scene in ``Steel
Magnolias,'' according to Sally Field.
   ``There was one scene where Dolly was by herself, and she was
supposed to be looking off-camera and giggling,'' Field said in
December's Redbook.
   ``To help her laugh, we did things that would have caused us to
be blackmailed forever! ... They should have filmed us and released
the footage to porno shops. The crew crawled away in
mortification,'' she said.
   Parton said the director, Herbert Ross, seemed to have a hard
time adjusting to the predominantly female cast, which also
includes Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis and Daryl Hannah.
   ``I think he was really scared working with all these women _
scared that we'd all have PMS (premenstrual syndrome) at the same
time!'' said Parton. ``Herbert was hard on me because I wasn't as
skilled in acting as the others. He told me I couldn't act.''
   Parton, characteristically, handled the criticism with aplomb.
   ``I said, `Well, hell, I know I can't act. It's your job to
teach me how. You hired me to make money for you.'''

   Actress-exercise guru Jane Fonda is
leading a celebrity entourage at a benefit tonight for an
environmental protection initiative.
   ``We have to find a way to reverse this trend of pollution in
our water and food and air, not to mention in the rest of the
world,'' Miss Fonda said.
   The sold-out event for the Environmental Protection Initiative
of 1990 features performances by Bonnie Raitt and Ry Cooder.
   Those willing to plunk down an extra $250 will be able to rub
elbows with Miss Fonda and the performers during a post-concert
reception.
   The statewide initiative would ban certain pesticides, reduce
the use of gases that deplete the Earth's protective ozone layer,
and prevent oil drilling near the coast.

   Planned Parenthood President Faye Wattleton and
West Point Cadet Corps Brigade Commander Kristin Baker are among
the dozen 1989 ``Women of the Year'' named in December's Glamour
magazine.
   Wattleton was chosen for defending the rights of women,
``especially poor ones, who would not have the money to travel for
a safe abortion if terminating a pregnancy were illegal in their
state.''
   Baker, 21, was honored for ``breaking through one more bastion
of maleness'' by becoming the first female cadet brigade commander
in West Point's 187-year history.
   The others are:
   _Candice Bergen and Diane English, the star and executive
producer of TV's ``Murphy Brown.''
   _The ``Central Park jogger,'' who was nearly killed by marauding
youths April 19 but since has made a slow recovery.
   _Takako Doi, leader of the Japanese Socialist Party.
   _Arlie Hochschild, sociologist and author of ``The Second
Shift.''
   _Iris Long, pharmaceutical chemist and expert in AIDS drug
testing.
   _Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, who spent two years in jail to rather
than hand over her daughter in a custody fight.
   _Euzhan Palcy, director of the movie ``A Dry White Season.''
   _Diane Sawyer, the TV newswoman.
   _Wendy Wasserstein, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright.

   Former porn movie star Harry Reems was placed
on five years' probation and ordered to pay back taxes after
pleading guilty to failing to pay income tax on $35,000 in movie
earnings.
   The star of such films as ``Deep Throat'' and ``The Devil in
Miss Jones,'' also must cooperate with the Internal Revenue Service
in paying fines and interest on the taxes owed, U.S. District Judge
Consuelo Marshall ruled Monday.
   Reems, 41, must take part in an alcohol detoxification program
and undergo psychological counseling, Marshall said.
   Reems, whose real name is Herbert Streicher, said he already has
made progress in an alcohol treatment program in Utah where he now
works as a real estate salesman.
   Reems was indicted in June for failing to file adequate tax
returns for the years 1982, 1984 and 1985.

   Former President Reagan told troubled teen-agers
that everything happens for a purpose _ even bad things.
   ``I know you haven't had it easy,'' Reagan said Tuesday to more
than 120 teen-agers at Covenant House. ``There must have been times
when you wondered if anyone cared.''
   ``People do care,'' he assured them. ``I care about you and
that's why I'm here.''
   Covenant House shelters about 25,000 runaway, homeless or
neglected children each year.
   Reagan told the youths that when he was young his family was
poor and his father was an alcoholic. ``There were nights when I
was angry and frustrated and wondered, `Why?'''
   But he said he was helped by his mother, who insisted
``everything happens for a reason. ... Down the road something good
will happen, and you'll realize it was for the best.''

<HEAD>Cosby Leads NBC to Another Big Ratings Victory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest weekly Nielsen ratings were filled
with smiles as eight comedies, six of them NBC's, were at the top.
   NBC took a big lead for the week, in which the ratings chart
looked like a virtual rerun of the previous week. Eight shows in
the top 10 were repeats from the week before.
   NBC also had the three top-rated shows with ``The Cosby Show''
first, ``Cheers'' second and ``A Different World'' third. ABC's
``Roseanne'' was fourth.
   NBC won the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average prime-time
rating of 15.4 to ABC's 12.7 and CBS' 11.8. Each point represents
the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million homes with televisions.
   NBC also took a lead in the November sweeps. Month-long sweeps
occur three times a year and result in tough competition between
networks. Advertising rates are based on the audience levels during
the periods.
   The ratings for the first 11 days of sweeps: NBC 15.2, CBS and
ABC 12.2, tied.
   After ``Roseanne,'' the rest of the top 10 were: NBC's ``Golden
Girls,'' NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' NBC's ``Dear John'' and ``Empty Nest''
tied, CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries'' and ABC's
``The Wonder Years'' tied.
   ABC's ``Small Sacrifices,'' in which Farrah Fawcett played a
woman convicted of killing one of her own children, was the
top-ranked non-regular show. It tied for 12th place with ABC Monday
Night Football and ABC's ``Who's the Boss?''
   NBC's ``Manhunt: The Search for the Night Stalker,'' up against
``Small Sacrifices'' and CBS' ``The Return of McCloud,'' on Sunday,
was 20th. ``McCloud'' tied for 39th place with ABC's ``Family
Matters.''
   In its final broadcast, ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' tied for 21st
place with NBC's ``Hunter.'' ``Chicken Soup,'' which starred
comedian Jackie Mason, will be replaced next week by the return of
``Coach.'' The time period is pre-empted this Tuesday by the final
chapter of ``Small Sacrifices.''
   The last part of the revolving wheel of the ABC Saturday Mystery
Movie, ``Christine Cromwell,'' made its debut last week in 43rd
place. The show stars Jaclyn Smith.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' kept its lead among the evening
news shows. On Thursday, when the Berlin Wall was opened and NBC's
Tom Brokaw was the only anchorman there, the ratings were ABC 12.0,
CBS 10.3, NBC 10.1. The ratings for the week: ABC 11.1, CBS 10.3,
NBC 10.0.

<HEAD>Navy Has 10 Serious Accidents in Three Weeks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Navy Accidents, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy's order to suspend most training
activities for 48 hours over a three-day period for a safety review
follows 10 serious accidents in less than three weeks.
   The order was issued Tuesday, about six hours after fire broke
out on the USS Inchon, an amphibious assault ship undergoing
maintenance at the shipyard in Norfolk, Va., headquarters of the
Atlantic Fleet.
   Also Tuesday, an F-14 crashed into the Gulf of Mexico 60 miles
northwest of Key West, Fla. The two-man crew bailed out and was not
seriously injured.
   At the same time, a technician at the Naval Surface Weapons
Testing Center in White Oak, Md., was slightly injured when two
grams of an experimental explosive detonated in a laboratory.
   Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said 23
sailors and eight civilians were injured and were taken to six
hospitals from the Norfolk fire. At least one victim was listed in
serious condition.
   Since the run of mishaps started Oct. 29, 10 people have been
killed or lost at sea and at least 53 people have been injured.
   Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 1, the Navy counted 101 ``operation and
training related'' fatalities in the service, including 47 in the
explosion aboard the USS Iowa on April 19.
   The most serious of the recent accidents occurred Oct. 29 when a
jet pilot making his first landing on an aircraft carrier crashed
into the USS Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico. The pilot and four
others on deck the ship were killed.
   Other incidents include:
   _A Navy reserve pilot flying an A-7E jet crashed Nov. 9 into an
apartment complex in Smyrna, Ga., killing two civilians and
injuring two others, including himself.
   _Three sailors and a reported $4 million worth of non-nuclear
missiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier USS
Eisenhower near Cape Hatteras, N.C. on Nov. 1. One sailor was
presumed dead.
   _Nine sailors were treated for burns or smoke inhalation when
fire erupted in the boiler aboard the USS Monongahela, some 500
miles west of Gibraltar on Nov. 1.
   _An F-A-18 pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided missile
cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean, causing minor injuries to
five sailors and blowing a 5-foot hole in the ship's bow Oct. 30.
   _A sailor aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson fell into
the Pacific about 620 miles north of Wake Island Oct. 30 and was
presumed lost.
   _Over the Nov. 11-12 weekend, one man was killed and five were
injured when the USS Kinkaid, a destroyer, collided off the coast
of Malaysia with a 430-foot freighter.

<HEAD>Bill Would Restrict U.S. Military Aid to Cambodian Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has acted to restrict the use of CIA
money to arm the non-communist guerrillas fighting the
Vietnamese-backed government in Cambodia, according to a published
report.
   A bill awaiting final passage would prevent President Bush from
using the agency's contingency funds to send weapons to the
guerrillas unless he first gets approval from Congress, The New
York Times reported in its Wednesday editions.
   Ordinarily, the administration does not need such approval to
use CIA contingency funds.
   The restriction is part of a secret appendix to the military
appropriations bill for the current fiscal year, The Times said.
The bill has emerged from a House-Senate conference committee and
is awaiting final action by both houses.
   The non-communist guerrillas in Cambodia belong to two groups
that are linked in a loose coalition with the Communist Khmer
Rouge, which murdered up to 2 million people when it ruled Cambodia
between 1975 and 1979.
   The United States opposes a return to power by the Khmer Rouge
but favors the non-communist resistance, which Vice President Dan
Quayle has called ``the best hope to see a political settlement
occur in Cambodia.'' The Bush administration has been providing
food, medicine and other non-military aid to the non-communist
guerrillas.
   In September, the State Department said the non-communist forces
should be strengthened as a means of encouraging the Phnom Penh
government to agree to share power. At that time, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher declined to say whether the United States
was attempting to strengthen the rebel groups with military aid.
   Key members of the congressional appropriations committees
strongly oppose any American military aid to the guerrillas, The
Times reported. It quoted Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., as saying
such aid could lead the United States into ``a major new military
involvement in the wars of Southeast Asia.''

<HEAD>New Lease on Life for Strife-Torn Civil Rights Panel Clears Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Civil Rights Commission, torn by
internal feuding and under fire in Congress, would gain a six-month
extension under legislation approved by the House Judiciary
Committee.
   ``The time has come in this country to put the petty bickering
and the waste of the taxpayers' money on the Civil Rights
Commission behind us,'' Rep. James F. Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., told
committee members Tuesday.
   The commission will go out of business Nov. 30 unless Congress
extends it. Republicans and Democrats critical of the strife that
has wracked the panel have so far been unable to agree on the
length of the extension.
   Approved by the committee, 25-9, was a Democratic-sponsored,
six-month extension that would keep on the front burner the
question of how to reshape the commission and end its long-running
internal feuds.
   The committee turned down a Republican plan to allow the
commission to go out of business for one day only, thus allowing
the Bush administration to dump any members it opposes. It then
would be reconstituted for six years.
   The Republican plan, offered by Sensenbrenner, was similar to a
version recommended to the committee by the Bush administration.
   ``We should not ram through a six-year bill in the closing days
of this Congress,'' said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chief
supporter of the Democratic version. He said he had initially
sought a one-year extension but bowed to a proposal by Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill., to cut that time in half.
   Twenty-five years ago, civil rights forces hailed the
commission's hearings across the South, its ringing reports on
racial injustice and its bold legislative proposals. ``It served as
the conscience of the nation,'' says Ralph G. Neas, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   Over the last six years, however, the commission has been
snarled in fierce internal fighting. Lately, Democrats and
Republicans on Capitol Hill have joined in slashing its budget.
   Controversy has dogged commission member William B. Allen, its
former chairman. He most recently came under fire for a speech to a
conservative group. The title was: ``Blacks? Animals? Homosexuals?
What is a Minority?''
   Allen, who is black, calls himself the only conservative on the
commission and says he does ``not believe in coddling people.''
   In a 6-1 vote, the commission branded the speech ``thoughtless,
disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory.''
   ``Frankly, it is a waste of the taxpayers' money to continue the
prattle that has been coming out of the commission for another six
months,'' Sensenbrenner said. ``We would be better off with no
civil rights commission than with this civil rights commission.''
   Hostile exchanges between Allen and Democratic commission member
Mary Frances Berry have been at the heart of the controversy, he
said.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., however, told the committee that
``anyone who was committed to the cause of civil rights who did not
spend a lot of time disagreeing with chairman Allen would be
derelict in his or her duty, since he is one of the more bizarre
public officials in my memory.''
   Sensenbrenner retorted that Berry ``has come up with some
bizarre statements of her own.'' He said it was urgently necessary
to take action to turn around the course of the commission.
   ``They have frankly made themselves into a national
laughingstock,'' he said.

   ``Better safe than sorry'' is the motto of a
public interest group that says Americans should act as watchdogs
for their own pension plans.
   ``Like millions of Americans, a large part of your savings may
be in a pension fund,'' says the Washington-based Pension Rights
Center. ``But a Great Dane or a German Shepherd can't protect the
money in your pension fund.''
   The center publishes a booklet, which costs $6, titled
``Protecting Your Pension Money.'' It outlines your rights, as well
as the rules that your pension plan's administrator must follow.
   Free pamphlets on the same subject are available from the
American Association of Retired Persons and the Labor Department.
   Whether or not you have a pension plan is up to your employer.
Only 46 percent of the nation's privately employed, full-time
workers are covered by private pension plans. And only 40 million
of the 76 million people covered by those plans are insured by the
government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.
   Pensions for employees working in offices or shops with fewer
than 25 employees are not insured by the federal government.
   Retirement benefits are most commonly based on the number of
years worked and final salary. Most plans have age and service
requirements before an employee can participate, and similar rules
for when the pension can be collected.
   The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as
ERISA, sets rules for pension plans.
   All pension plans differ, but overall you have the right to:
   _Find out the overall status of your plan by requesting in
writing from your employer a ``Summary Plan Description'' outlining
your company's plan.
   _Ask your plan administrator for a copy of your employer's
Summary Annual Report, which details your company's finances.
   _Obtain a copy of the company's Form 5500, a more detailed
financial report, available on written request from the Labor
Department.
   Those running your plan must follow a number of rules. Among the
most important:
   _Your plan managers are required to invest the money with your
best interests in mind. They may not make investments to benefit
themselves or your employer, if these conflict with your interests.
   _Administrative costs of running your plan must be reasonable.
   _To hedge against risks, managers can't put all the pension
money into one investment, such as a single stock or one piece of
real estate.
   If it appears the rules have been broken, you should notify the
Labor Department's Pension and Welfare Administration. If you
suspect the administrators have taken loans from the plan or had
conflicts of interest, you should contact the Employee Plans
Division of the Internal Revenue Service.
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation handles cases of kickbacks
and embezzlement.
   ``The most effective way to convince government investigators to
take a look at your problem is to provide them with a short summary
of the problems you have found together with the supporting
documents,'' the Pension Rights Center says.
   ``If you cannot convince a government agency to investigate your
plan, you might want to consider contacting a lawyer,'' it says.

<HEAD>Holiday Turkey Prices Down; Hams More Expensive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of holiday turkeys will be down from a
year ago, but hams are going to be more expensive, the Agriculture
Department says.
   ``Consumers will find adequate supplies of turkey and ham for
the holiday season,'' the department's Economic Research Service
reported Tuesday. ``Prices likely will be lower for turkeys but
higher for hams than last year.''
   Turkey production in the fourth quarter may be up about 12
percent from a year ago, with frozen inventories up slightly. Ham
supplies are expected to decline slightly despite an increase in
cold-storage stocks.
   ``Total red meat and poultry production is expected to set a
record in 1989 and again in 1990,'' the report said. ``Among the
major components, only beef production may decline in 1989,
reflecting the reduced cattle inventory.''
   Looking to 1990, the report said beef production may increase
somewhat because of more cattle going into feedlots before
slaughter, resulting in more ``fed'' beef.
   ``In both years, pork output could remain relatively large,''
the report said. ``Broiler output will continue to grow'' because
of improved profits in recent years.
   ``Turkey production also is expected to grow, but at a lower
rate than broilers because returns are being squeezed.''
   For producers, the report said more meat and poultry in 1990,
along with ``weaker growth in per capita income,'' could put
downward pressure on market prices.
   ``Increased red meats will be about offset by population
growth,'' the report added. ``As a result, prices of choice-grade
steers and (market hogs) should be a little above 1989's average.
However, with higher per capita output, wholesale poultry prices
are expected to decline moderately.''
   Exports of beef and veal in 1989 could rise to a record of 1
billion pounds, up 46 percent from 1988 due largely to
liberalization of the Japanese market, the report said. An
additional increase of 12 percent to 15 percent is expected in 1990.
   Comparatively, total U.S. beef production in 1989 is forecast at
22.8 billion pounds, and pork at 15.8 billion pounds.
   Imports of beef and veal, mostly from Australia and New Zealand,
are expected to decline about 8 percent this year from their 1988
level, mostly due to smaller supplies in Australia. Declines are
likely in 1990 because of smaller New Zealand shipments.
   Pork imports in 1989 are indicated at about 950 million pounds,
down 16 percent from 1988, but those may rise to about 1 billion
pounds in 1990 if Danish production continues to increase, the
report said.
   U.S. pork exports, mostly to Mexico and Japan, are expected to
be about 240 million pounds this year, up from 195 million in 1988.
Those may decline to around 205 million pounds in 1990.
   Broiler exports may rise to a record of around 937 million
pounds this year, up 22 percent from 1988. Most of the sales are
commercial rather than under foreign aid and subsidy programs.
Exports could decline slightly in 1990.

   The number of workers employed by farmers
showed a seasonal decline in October but was up slightly from a
year ago, according to the Agriculture Department.
   A quarterly report said Tuesday that the hired work force on
farms was estimated at 983,000 during the week of Oct. 8-14, down
from 1,197,000 in July. A year ago in October the work force was
976,000.
   Those did not include 308,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. In July, those
totaled 351,000 workers, and in October 1988 they were estimated at
274,000.
   Dry weather throughout most of the nation during the farm-labor
survey week allowed corn and other row crop harvests to make good
progress, the report said.
   The report said the national figures for hired workers had a
sampling error of 3.5 percent.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $5.42
per hour, up from $5.23 in July and $5.18 a year ago, the report
said.
   For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage
rate available, However, workers in California were reported at
$6.41 per hour, compared with $5.80 in July and $6.16 a year
earlier in October 1988. Florida workers averaged $5.15 per hour,
compared with $5.55 in July and $4.98 a year earlier.

<HEAD>Bush Meets With Four GOP Supporters of Abortion Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House says President Bush's
opposition to abortion rights is ``not subject to change,'' though
he will campaign next week for a pair of pro-choice House
Republicans.
   The two, Reps. Lynn Martin of Illinois and Claudine Schneider of
Rhode Island, were among four GOP women who met with Bush on
Tuesday to press their point that the Republican Party should
remain open to those who don't go along with Bush's opposition to
most abortions.
   ``We could see the wheels of thought going through his mind,''
said Schneider. ``I think he heard us.''
   The House, meanwhile, took a step in Bush's direction on the
question of federally funded abortions.
   The Appropriations Committee approved new versions of two
spending bills Bush vetoed last month. The new versions comply with
Bush's demand that they maintain a ban on federal funding for most
abortions, including cases of rape or incest. However, one measure
still could draw Bush's objections by allowing the District of
Columbia to use local money for abortions.
   Abortion rights leaders said they may continue their fight to
loosen the restrictions on abortions for poor women, at least in
the Senate.
   But House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said it was time for the
pro-choice side to accept that Bush will prevail for now and devote
their energies toward another try next year.
   ``Without the votes to overturn that veto, we have to face the
fact that there's going to be a denial of funds,'' Foley said.
``The president has to take responsibility for that decision.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Bush would speak at a fund-raising event Monday for Martin and
Schneider, who are planning 1990 races for Senate seats in their
respective states.
   Both have been advocates of abortion rights. They are among
Republicans voicing concern that the party's anti-abortion platform
and identification with abortion foes hurt it in the odd-year
elections last week and may do more damage in the 1990 elections.
   ``Abortion is not a test of support ... no matter what one's
position is,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The president supports all Republicans,'' Fitzwater said. ``He
supports Republican candidates without regard to specific positions
that differ from him.'' He said Bush's own views ``are based on his
firm moral beliefs and they are not subject to change.''
   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who also attended the meeting, said
the Republicans gained no commitment from Bush and did not expect
him to reverse positions. But, she said, they hoped ``there could
be some gradations in his position'' in the future.
   ``We certainly mentioned the fact we were concerned about the
implications for our party,'' Snowe said. ``We want to avoid
political losses.''
   Also attending was Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut.
   Bush supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw most
abortions.
   The appropriations panel approved without dissent the revised
versions of a $157 billion bill for 1990 spending on labor,
education and health programs, and a bill appropriating $558
million for the District of Columbia government. Bush vetoed both
last month because of their more liberal abortion provisions.
   The House's approval of the larger bill last month marked the
first time in a decade it had voted to loosen a restriction on
federally financed abortions except in the cases where the mother's
life is in danger. But the House failed by 51 votes to override
Bush's veto.
   Abortion opponents said they still objected to the D.C. bill,
however, because it would permit the district government to use
local money to pay for abortions for poor women. Bush objected to
even that financing in his veto message, and Doug Johnson, lobbyist
for the National Right to Life Committee, said the new version
would invite yet another veto.
   On still another abortion front, the House backed away from a
threatened Bush veto on a foreign aid bill that includes $15
million for the United Nations Population Fund, a family planning
effort that opponents charge indirectly supports coerced abortions
in China.

<HEAD>Mitchell Wants Clean Air Bill First on January Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell says he
wants a comprehensive proposal to clean the nation's air as the
first legislation considered by senators when they return from a
recess in late January.
   Mitchell said Tuesday that the scheduling is a response
accusations by President Bush that the Democratic-led Congress of
moving too slowly on the bill.
   Bush introduced his clean air proposal in July, calling it one
of his top priorities and promising the plan would sharply reduce
urban smog, toxic chemical air pollution and acid rain by the end
of the century.
   Bush asked Congress to give him a clean air bill by the new
year, but sponsors of the legislation said from the start that the
timetable likely would not be met.
   Moments after Mitchell, D-Maine, spoke to his colleagues on the
Senate Environment subcommittee on environmental protection, the
panel completed work on clean air legislation and sent it to the
full Environment and Public Works Committee.
   Earlier, members of the subcommittee complained the panel was
moving so fast they lacked time to study last-minute acid rain
proposals.
   The subcommittee, which previously completed work on the urban
smog and toxic chemical portions of the legislation, approved acid
rain language that incorporated much of Bush's proposal.
   The full committee will begin work Thursday. While senators
began their consideration later than the House, they have outpaced
their counterparts. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is
unlikely to take up the bill until next year because lawmakers plan
to begin their recess this month.
   The Senate subcommittee accepted these Bush proposals:
   _A 10 million ton reduction by the end of the century in sulfur
dioxide, the chief ingredient of acid rain.
   _A cap that would prevent any growth of acid rain emissions once
reduction targets are met by Jan. 1, 2000.
   _Placing the cleanup burden on 107 of the nation's dirtiest
coal-burning utilities, mostly in the Midwest.
   _A program of credits for utilities exceeding their reduction
targets, which could then be sold to utilities seeking to expand
capacity.
   Other language, authored by subcommittee chairman Max Baucus,
D-Mont., would go beyond the administration's proposal.
   A second main ingredient of acid rain, nitrogen oxide, would be
reduced by 1 million tons by 2000, while the Bush legislation would
permit a 1 million ton increase. Also, the Baucus legislation's
reduction deadline is a year ahead of the administration date.
   Acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
that mixes in the atmosphere and is carried for hundreds of miles
before falling in rain, snow, fog, mist and as dry particles.
   The pollution makes lakes and streams acidic, killing aquatic
life; destroys trees, and can be harmful to human health. Much of
the pollution comes from utilities that burn high sulfur coal, but
other industrial facilities also contribute to the problem.
   The most controversial language added by Baucus would allow six
states to postpone meeting acid rain reduction targets, and to be
assigned reductions more lenient than the rest of the country.
   The language would apply to states that emitted less than
150,000 tons of sulfur dioxide in 1985, provided their utilities
installed devices known as scrubbers to cut pollution. The break
would go to Baucus' state, Montana, as well as North Dakota,
Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico and Minnesota.
   Another Baucus provision would repeal a 1977 requirement that
new coal-fired utilities install scrubbers. The purpose is to allow
use of low sulfur coal without requiring this expensive technology.

<HEAD>Bidding Process Bypassed to Avert Shutdown of Weapons Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department bypassed the usual
competitive bidding process in granting a $3.6 million consulting
contract to avert a shutdown of key nuclear weapons plants,
according to government records.
   The contract was given to BDM Corp. earlier this month for
``specialized technical and administrative support'' of the
department's effort to handle radioactive wastes generated by the
federal nuclear weapons complex, according to an internal
department memorandum made public Tuesday by Sen. David Pryor,
D-Ark.
   The document said that unless a ``bridge contract,'' or
extension of BDM's original work agreement, was granted for at
least six months starting Nov. 1, at least three weapons production
facilities might have been forced to close.
   Such a closure would have effectively paralyzed the production
of nuclear arms.
   The three sites are the Rocky Flats plant near Denver that is
the nation's only producer of plutonium triggers for nuclear
warheads; the Savannah River complex near Aiken, S.C., the sole
source of tritium to boost the explosive power of warheads; and the
Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, which
recovers enriched uranium from fuel used by naval and research
reactors.
   Pryor sent a letter to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins
outlining what Pryor called excessive use of private consultants to
do government work, including drafting letters to Congress and
writing memos to field office managers. Pryor said this raised
troubling questions about potential conflicts of interest.
   ``I question if DOE as a whole is serious in addressing this
issue,'' Pryor wrote.
   Pryor, who has criticized federal use of consultants and
contractors for years, said he was astounded to learn during an
investigation by his staff that some weapons plants might have been
forced to close if BDM were not kept on the department's payroll.
   A document issued by the department's office of procurement
operations said BDM was ``the only company which can provide the
required continuity'' to carry out the waste management work. It
added: ``Only BDM staff, through their 29 months of constant
contact with the program, is cognizant of the current status of
each project.''
   ``That is total dependency on a major contractor'' for work that
the government's own employees should be performing, Pryor said.
   The Energy Department had no response Tuesday to Pryor's remarks.
   BDM said the appropriate officials to respond to questions were
not available.
   The documents released by Pryor indicate that the Energy
Department had used up its available work hours by BDM faster than
planned. Thus an emergency ``bridge contract'' for 6 to 9 months
was sought to continue the consultants' work on various nuclear
waste projects until a new long-term contract could be awarded.
   The usual competitive bidding process for a new long-term
contract was started July 7, but that process cannot be completed
until at least next March, the documents said.
   A department memorandum to Undersecretary John Tuck, dated Oct.
31, said a decision to grant the emergency contract should take
into account the likely publicity resulting from Pryor's staff
investigation of the BDM matter.
   ``It may be argued that the `emergency' award of a letter
`bridge' contract modification demonstrates Sen. Pryor's point that
the government is being performed by invisible contractors
performing vital federal functions,'' Berton J. Roth of the
directorate of procurement and assistance management said in the
memo to Tuck.
   The memo indicates that Tuck approved the emergency contract on
Oct. 31.

   Surreptitiously, the AFL-CIO smuggled aid into
Poland to keep the spirit of Solidarity alive while Lech Walesa was
under arrest, and publicly _ very publicly _ Walesa is thanking his
benefactors.
   On his visit to Washington, he kept tossing bouquets. He threw a
bear hug around a beaming ``Brother Kirkland'' _ Lane Kirkland,
president of the AFL-CIO _ Tuesday and thanked America for
receiving him.
   He sounded like a happy tourist.
   ``It seems to me that no country has so many trees in the
streets,'' he marveled.
   This shipyard electrician from Gdansk went before the labor
federation to revel in ``the bond of friendship between Solidarity
and the AFL-CIO'' which had been ``shaped over the years, both good
and bad.''
   During Walesa's nine-year ordeal, which has resulted in a
non-communist government peacefully taking power in Warsaw,
Kirkland arranged quietly to provide about $5 million in help.
   The AFL-CIO sent into Poland the printing presses Solidarity
needed to circulate its message. When the authorities discovered a
press and seized it, another would be delivered in the night.
   In repayment, Walesa gave Washington a piece of the action, a
hero to cheer, while history unfolds in Eastern Europe.
   Official Washington is officially cautious about events in the
Soviet bloc, but even President Bush could set aside prudence
Monday night and welcome a teary Walesa as ``the spiritual
godfather of a new generation.''
   To address his colleagues in the labor movement, Walesa stuck a
union button in his lapel. When he arrived, the labor leaders stood
and cheered him for 15 minutes.
   He even brought a historic fact: the ``first strike in American
history, in the Jamestown colony,'' in 1619, was staged by Poles.
   ``Some of my countrymen _ glassworkers,'' he said, recalling
that bit of labor history, ``lit a flame of freedom and human
dignity that is burning to this day at home, in Poland, and here in
the United States.''
   Organized labor here has had its own bad years recently.
Membership growth is stagnant. Fewer than one worker in six is
unionized. The strike against Eastern Airlines has been costly and
ineffective. Praise from an international hero could hardly have
been more welcome.
   At a news conference, Walesa, his words translated sentence by
sentence, pleaded for more help for a Poland that he said is
desperate and ripe for investment.
   Two-thirds of its apartment houses, he said, are slums and its
automobiles are antiques that pollute and ``gulp gasoline like
monsters.''
   ``Our children and grandchildren will laugh at us because we had
poverty, but tanks and missiles _ those were plentiful.''
   If American banks were willing to make loans when it was run by
the communists, he said, they should be willing to help now.
   ``In Eastern Europe, everything is in short supply, even, or
rather first and foremost, time,'' he said. ``No one knows how much
time we have left to reform our economy, but we all feel it is not
much. If we fail to convince people that although things are
changing perhaps too slowly they are nevertheless changing for the
better, then this breeze of freedom I spoke of will soon disappear,
leaving behind only a sense of bitterness accompanying
unaccomplished dreams.
   ``It will result in a defeat for us, but not only for us.''
   When he finished speaking, the union chiefs in his audience _
leaders of the garment workers, the carpenters, the Teamsters, the
musicians, the schoolteachers _ linked arms and serenaded him with
an old union song whose title took on a new twist, ``Solidarity
Forever.''

<HEAD>Industry Group Urges Sales Suspension of L-tryptophan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Makers of L-tryptophan are suspending
distribution and sales of the dietary supplement because of its
possible link to a potentially fatal blood disorder, an industry
group says.
   The Council for Responsible Nutrition called for the temporary
sales halt as a ``prudent and cautious course of action'' even
though no link has been established between the non-prescription
supplement and the disorder.
   Some companies started halting sales soon after the council
called for the action Tuesday afternoon, said J.B. Cordaro,
president of the Washington-based council that represents
nutritional supplement companies, including most makers of
L-tryptophan. He said he expected virtually all makers of the
product to comply with the council's call by Thursday.
   Officials were investigating 81 unconfirmed cases of the
disorder, known as eosinophilia, in 17 states and the District of
Columbia, according to the Food and Drug Administration.
   New Mexico on Monday banned L-tryptophan. Oregon's Health
Division recommended the product be withdrawn, and health officials
in Illinois and Idaho recommended that people avoid using
L-tryptophan.
   The council's action pertains to the food supplement that is
sold in tablet and capsule form, which is used for sleeplessness
and premenstrual syndrome. It does not cover multi-ingredient
products that also contain L-tryptophan.
   ``This action should not be viewed as a product recall but an
interim measure pending clarification of the causes of this
outbreak,'' the council said.
   ``Public health agencies investigating have not been able to
establish a scientific basis or isolate medical evidence that links
L-tryptophan with this disorder,'' the council said. ``In addition,
to date FDA and industry testing of L-tryptophan products have not
identified any product contamination.''
   A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration, Don McLearn,
said the agency was satisfied with the industry's action.
   McLearn said that without a stronger cause-and-effect link, the
FDA has no authority to order a recall. He said the strongest
action the agency could take was announced Saturday when it advised
people taking L-tryptophan to discontinue use of the product.
   At least 12 different brands of L-tryptophan have been
identified as having been used by the individuals who became ill in
recent weeks.
   Eosinophilia is marked by a higher than normal number of white
blood cells known as eosinophils. Symptoms include severe muscle
pain, fever, joint pain, weakness, swelling of the arms and legs
and skin rash.

<HEAD>$3.2 Billion Increase in Drug War Sent to Bush</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An additional $3.2 billion to finance the Bush
administration's war on drugs is heading for the president's desk
after getting final congressional approval from the Senate.
   Under the measure, anti-drug funds would climb to $8.8 billion
this year, $900 million more than requested by President Bush on
Sept. 5 in a nationally televised address outlining his plan of
attack on narcotics.
   Approval of the funds represents the major congressional action
on the drug issue thus far this year. The House and Senate are
forming a fresh conference committee to try to resolve differences
over non-money items, including the administration's so-called
Andean Strategy.
   The funds were included in an overall $12 billion money bill for
the Transportation Department in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The rest of the transportation bill received final congressional
approval from the Senate last week with only the anti-drug money
drawing fire. It was approved Tuesday by unanimous consent without
discussion.
   All but a few details had been worked out between the
administration and Senate negotiators in September. The conference
committee last month dropped all non-money items but made only
minor funding changes.
   The House approved the money Nov. 1 on a voice vote.
   Included in the package is $1 billion for the federal prison
system for buildings, $308 million for law enforcement grants to
state and local governments as well as $727 million for programs
involving alcohol, drug abuse and mental health.
   The House on Monday approved four bills containing the non-money
items that had been detached from the package. The Senate on
Tuesday considered those four bills, substituted its own version
for the language approved by the House and sent the measures to a
House-Senate conference committee.
   The primary measure would authorize military training and law
enforcement assistance for Bolivia, Colombia and Peru under the
administration's so-called Andean Strategy. Mexico and other
countries also would receive aid under the proposal.
   Other measures would expand a drug-free schools program approved
by Congress earlier this year, allow transfers out of the fund for
assets seized from drug dealers and divide the alcohol, drug abuse
and mental health block grant program into separate programs for
substance abuse and mental health.
   The overall transportation bill permanently prohibits smoking
aboard nearly all airline flights within the United States.
   Smoking would be allowed on flights originating in Alaska or
Hawaii or bound for those states and scheduled to last longer than
six hours _ about 28 out of 17,500 daily U.S. flights.
   Currently, smoking is banned on flights lasting two hours or
less. The new rules would take effect 96 days after the measure is
signed into law.
   The same measure provides $12 billion for federal transportation
programs for the new fiscal year. The bill includes $30.7 million
to subsidize air carriers that serve small towns, and a $40 million
down payment to build a new airport in Denver, the first new U.S.
airport in 15 years.

   The Rev. John Dompka and his parishioners
look to the heavens in more ways than one.
   Dompka, 70, a licensed pilot, is pastor of St. Margaret Mary
Roman Catholic Church, located on a hilltop near Greater Pittsburgh
International Airport.
   Many in the congregation of 1,500 families work at the airport,
and Dompka said he sometimes flashes a photo of an airplane on the
audio-visual display screen behind the church altar.
   ``To get their attention immediately, I sometimes use my
aviation experience in my sermons,'' he said.
   The congregation's enthusiasm for flying can be seen on the
church's stationery, which features a picture of an astronaut
conducting lunar experiments.
   On the stationery is this note: ``Saint Margaret Mary Church, a
parish of plane people with a special air about them. Saturday
evening mass at 6:30 to accommodate earthlings.''
   Dompka said he is one of about 150 members of the National
Association of Priest Pilots. He also belongs to the Beaver Valley
Flying Club, whose 60 members share access to three Cessnas and a
Piper Archer.

   Flatnose the tree-climbing dog
disappointed fans in his first public tree-climbing effort since
undergoing surgery to have a pacemaker inserted.
   Panting and slobbering, Flatnose tugged himself a couple of feet
up a pine pole in a demonstration Tuesday at the Mid-Atlantic Farm
Show, but he didn't shimmy like he used to do on ``The Tonight
Show.''
   After four or five tries, with the audience drifting away,
Flatnose went backstage and stretched out on the floor to rest.
   Does it mean his career as ``the world's only tree-climbing
dog'' is over?
   Not according to Barney Odom, the self-described ``old country
boy'' from South Carolina who owns and trains Flatnose. Odom said
the tree set up for Flatnose wasn't thick enough to really grab
with his paws.
   He didn't think the dog was slowed by his September heart
surgery. The pacemaker, inserted at the veterinary school at North
Carolina State University, has helped Flatnose overcome spells when
he would fall on his side with his legs kicking, Odom said.
   ``Old Flatnose is doing right good since his surgery,'' he said.
``I've been exercising him.''
   He said Flatnose scrambled right up a tree in practice recently.

<TEXT>
   Legislation to force federal authorities to
restrict the shipment of food in rail cars or trucks that also ship
garbage or hazardous materials is proceeding through the House.
   The Energy and Commerce subcommittee on transportation, tourism
and hazardous materials approved the legislation Tuesday after
testimony last week described a practice known as ``backhauling.''
   Backhauling, intended to increase the revenues of shippers,
means carrying a cargo on the return trip after making an original
shipment.
   Recent hearings and news reports have documented how shippers
bringing food from the Midwest to the East have carryied return
loads of garbage because eastern landfills are overflowing.
   The bill would require the administration to determine which
cargoes may be backhauled and what procedure are needed to clean
the vehicles when backhauling is permitted.
   Subcommittee chairman Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, said the bill is
intended to give flexibility to regulators.
   ``This is not intended to be a veto or elimination of any
backhauling,'' he said. ``We don't want to foul up or create
blockades within the food distribution system.''
   Luken represents Cincinnati, where Kroger, a major supermarket
chain, has its headquarters.
   The bill is part of larger legislation dealing with hazardous
shipments, including the safety of hazardous chemical shipments by
rail. The spinoff bill was created because of publicity generated
by the hearing.
   Today, the Public Works and Transportation surface
transportation subcommittee is putting the final touches on related
legislation, and the full committee is scheduled to vote on it
Thursday.
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Bill Clinger, R-Pa., forbids
backhauling of municipal solid waste in refrigerated food trucks
and forbids mixed use of tank trucks or cars for hauling both food
and non-food items.

<HEAD>Congress, On Eve of Walesa Speech, Votes Aid to Poland</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress is moving rapidly to reinforce
Poland's dramatic political and economic changes with U.S. dollars,
creating a three-year, $657 million aid program and providing the
first hard cash to back up that promise.
   The Senate voted 99-0 on Tuesday to support new business
enterprises,stabilize currency, provide emergency food and
encourage democratic institutions in Poland, on the eve of
Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa's speech to a joint meeting of
Congress. The measure also included $81 million in aid for Hungary.
   ``Lech Walesa, this is for you and a free Poland,'' said Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., a primary sponsor of the aid measure.
   Both Poland and Hungary have been in the forefront of the wave
of reform sweeping Eastern Europe that includes radical opening of
political institutions and restructuring of economies along Western
lines.
   At the same time, the House moved to put the first dollars into
the new program, voting 324-93 for a foreign aid bill that includes
$293 million in the current year, along with another $240 million
in standby credit and trade insurance.
   The House measure, a $14.6 billion bill providing U.S. aid to
allies around the globe, also offered up to $85 million for El
Salvador's besieged military and $125 million to help Andean
countries fight the drug war.
   But the money bill was the subject of a White House veto threat
because of a provision, growing out of the Iran-Contra scandal,
which would bar use of foreign aid to entice other countries to
carry out policies contrary to U.S. law. The administration
believed the language would tie its hands in dealings with allies.
   Another potentially contentious issue in the $14.6 billion bill
was defused when the House voted 219 to 203 to give President Bush
the right to withhold $15 million for the United Nations Population
Fund if he finds the agency supports forced abortions or
sterilizations in China. The measure now goes to the Senate.
   For Poland and Hungary, major elements of the appropriations
measure included a $200 million grant to help stabilize Poland's
battered economy and $45 million for a private enterprise
development fund. Other money would go for environmental cleanup,
agriculture and educational and cultural exchanges.
   The bill creating the long-term aid program represented an
apparent truce in a game of one-upsmanship between the White House
and congressional Democrats over who could provide the biggest
reward to Poland. Bush had proposed a $455 million program which
was immediately labeled ``timid'' by Democrats, who proposed
upwards of $1 billion in aid.
   As passed by the Senate, the measure offers $200 million in
currency stabilization, $400 million in enterprise funds and $125
million in food aid. Recognizing Poland's serious economic problems
and a reform plan advanced to address them, the bill allocates $657
million for that country over three years. Hungary would receive
$81 million.
   Overall, the foreign aid appropriations bill included $4.7
billion in military aid and $3.2 billion in economic aid for U.S.
friends and allies around the world.
   Among major earmarks for countries in the bill were $3 billion
for Israel and $2.1 billion for Egypt, always the largest aid
recipients because of their participation in the Camp David peace
process.
   Other large recipients included Pakistan, with $460 million in
military and economic aid; Turkey, $500 million in military aid;
Greece, $350 million in military aid; and $63 million in military
and economic aid for Morocco.
   In addition, the agreement provides $160 million for the U.S.
contribution to the Multilateral Assistance Initiative for the
Philippines, $83 million for Afghanistan relief, $83 million for
Jordan and $30 million in military aid to countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa.

   A package of reforms for the scandal-plagued
Department of Housing and Urban Development is heading for the
Senate after winning House approval.
   The House agreed overwhelmingly on a voice vote Tuesday evening
to approve the HUD reform package, which includes proposals from
Secretary Jack Kemp as well as others arising from a congressional
investigation of the department's multibillion-dollar scandals.
   ``I believe the bill allows us to get the HUD scandals behind
us,'' said Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House
committee that approved the measure.
   The action came after his panel, the House Banking subcommittee
on housing and community development, last week stripped away a
larger proposal to revamp federal housing programs. Some Democrats
had hoped to keep the two linked as a way to force congressional
action on the housing program revision.
   The bill requires that consultants and lobbyists working on HUD
programs register with the department and identify for whom they
are working, as well as any fees they receive. Civil penalties
would be imposed for those who fail to comply, and recipients of
HUD grants would have to report their use of consultants and
lobbyists.
   Other provisions:
   _Create a new HUD chief financial officer's position, as well as
a comptroller of the Federal Housing Administration, to oversee
financial management. It includes reforms in the FHA-insured
mortgage program, including a prohibition on loans for second homes.
   _Apply new restrictions on the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation
program, which provided subsidies for renovating low-income housing
that were at the heart of evidence of influence-peddling and
political favoritism in the HUD scandals. The bill limits the
number of housing units that may be subsidized per project to 100.
   _Authorize $25 million for HUD to monitor and evaluate its
programs _ less than the one-half of 1 percent of program spending,
or about $100 million, that Kemp sought.
   _Require full disclosure of HUD funding decisions, and place
restrictions on accounts for which the secretary has discretionary
authority.
   _Increase from 60 percent to 75 percent the amount of assistance
under the Community Development Block Grant that must be used for
projects benefiting the poor. Kemp had proposed an even tighter
requirement that spending go for the poor.
   _Restrict the administration's ability to fire the department's
inspector general.

<HEAD>Hooded Former Drug Dealer Says Destroy Coca Crops</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A convicted drug dealer says the only way to
stop the cocaine trade is to destroy the coca crop in South America.
   ``Cut off the snake's head and the snake will die,'' he said.
``Go after the crop or the chemicals that process the coca. I don't
think anything else will do any good.''
   The witness who wore a black hood to conceal his identity _
``Mr. Witness,'' the congressmen called him _ insisted to a
skeptical House subcommittee Tuesday that stepped up efforts to
interdict the drug flow are fruitless.
   Wiping out the coca crop in Colombia and surrounding South
American nations might result in substitute crops springing up in
other regions of the world, he said, adding that such a move would
buy time.
   ``What we need now is a breather. It would take two to three
years to re-establish a useable crop of coca,'' he said. ``During
that time we could take steps to see that it is not done.''
   Such a move, he said, would be ``more practical than what we're
doing now.''
   The witness, arrested in 1985 after several years of overseeing
huge cocaine shipments from Colombia to Miami, said nothing can
stop the flow of cocaine once the coca crop is harvested and
processed into the drug.
   He said the drug importing cartels can change their tactics
``instantly'' to circumvent U.S. enforcement moves.
   For example, he said if efforts are concentrated on sealing off
borders along the Gulf Coast, the importers say: ``We'll let you
have fun there, we'll bring the stuff through California.''
   The witness was accompanied by a group of federal marshals
during his appearance before the House Banking subcommittee on
financial institutions supervision, regulation and insurance. His
voice was distorted electronically to help protect his identity.
   He said he is convinced the people of Colombia would support
eradication of coca crops if the United States provided economic
aid for poor coca farmers to replace their lost income.
   ``The cartel had the popular support of the people, but not
now,'' he said. ``All these bombings and raids have done more to
hurt the common man than anyone else.''
   He said he didn't ``know anything about money laundering,'' the
subcommittee's main area of jurisdiction in drug laws, but
suggested currency financial restrictions aren't as important as
several subcommittee members believe.

<HEAD>State Department Cites Cuts, But Pentagon Can't Provide Estimate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department says the Soviet Union has
cut its defense spending, but the Pentagon says it can't provide an
estimate until the year is over.
   ``It's too early to give a final estimate of Soviet defense
spending for 1989,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret D.
Tutwiler said Tuesday. ``However, it does appear that Soviet
defense spending this year is less than it was last year.''
   The Bush administration has seen evidence of cuts in Soviet
defense efforts, including reductions in the production of
conventional weapons, she said.
   ``We have also seen withdrawals of conventional weapons and
troops from Eastern Europe and Mongolia,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   CIA estimates of Soviet military spending show a 1.5 percent
decline for this year, and intelligence officials project a decline
of 7 percent for 1990, The Washington Post reported in its
Wednesday editions, citing anonymous sources.
   Last week, at an arms control seminar near Queenstown, Md., a
U.S. official told reporters that the Soviets had cut tank
production and slowed production of Typhoon nuclear submarines.
   The official, who could not be identified under seminar rules,
said there was ``credible evidence'' of a cutback in tank output.
   But Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, echoing statements made
earlier this week by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, disputed
reports the Soviets had slowed the modernization of some long-range
nuclear weapons or had evidence of cutbacks in conventional arms.
   ``There's obviously no way of knowing for sure what spending for
'89 is until 1989 is over,'' Williams said.
   However, Ms. Tutwiler said ``the experts'' believe there have
been reductions.
   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said
two weeks ago that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev had basically
fulfilled his pledge to reduce tank divisions in Eastern Europe.
   Gorbachev promised last December to withdraw six divisions over
two years. Aspin, who recently visited the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe, said regiments amounting to three divisions had been
withdrawn.
   Gorbachev also promised to cut military spending by 14 percent
and to remove 500,000 men from the Soviet armed forces.

<HEAD>Alcohol Warning Labels Ready; Some Complain They're Too Small</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of a law requiring all new bottles
and cans of alcoholic beverages to carry a warning directed at
drivers and pregnant women are complaining that the warning is too
small.
   ``It's almost impossible to read,'' Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.,
said Tuesday, pointing at a sample beer bottle. ``The ATF has
purposely allowed the industry to come up with a label that is
illegible.''
   Gore was joined by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and several
public and private medical officials in lambasting the Treasury
Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for allowing
distillers and brewers to print the warning in small, narrow type _
half the size of newspaper type, in many cases.
   Under the law that becomes effective Saturday, the label of each
can or bottle of alcoholic beverages must carry these words:
``Government Warning: (1) According to the Surgeon General, women
should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of
the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages
impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery and may
cause health problems.''
   Thurmond and Gore said the first part of the warning is
especially necessary, because many Americans remain unaware that
alcohol is the leading recognizable cause of mental retardation in
infants.
   Under the ATF's temporary regulation implementing the law, the
warning may be affixed virtually anywhere on a bottle or can.
   Dot Koester, a spokeswoman for the ATF, took note of the
criticism and said: ``Remember, this is a temporary rule. We hope
to get our final regulations out before the end of the year, and
certainly we'll be considering everybody's complaints.''
   Alcoholic beverages bottled or canned as of Saturday must have
the new warning _ not those already on the shelves. Even for beer,
it could take months for the new labels to turn up in stores.
   Frederick K. Goodwin, administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse
and Mental Health Association, said fetal alcohol syndrome, a
cluster of irreversible birth defects, affects 2.2 of every 1,000
infants born in the United States. It ranks ahead of Down's
syndrome and spina bifida as a cause of mental retardation, he said.
   Goodwin stressed there ``is no known safe level of alcohol
consumption'' for pregnant women.
   James C. Sanders, president of the Beer Institute, an industry
lobbying arm, said: ``We believe the information on the labels
should have little or no impact since the risks of alcohol abuse
are common knowledge to the public. The temporary regulations for
the size and placement of the labels are reasonable; however, we
will comply with whatever final regulations are issued.''

<HEAD>Bush Meets With Four GOP Supporters of Abortion Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House says President Bush's
opposition to abortion rights is ``not subject to change,'' though
he will campaign next week for a pair of pro-choice House
Republicans.
   The two, Reps. Lynn Martin of Illinois and Claudine Schneider of
Rhode Island, were among four GOP women who met with Bush on
Tuesday to press their point that the Republican Party should
remain open to those who don't go along with Bush's opposition to
most abortions.
   ``We could see the wheels of thought going through his mind,''
said Schneider. ``I think he heard us.''
   The House, meanwhile, took a step in Bush's direction on the
question of federally funded abortions.
   The Appropriations Committee approved new versions of two
spending bills Bush vetoed last month. The new versions comply with
Bush's demand that they maintain a ban on federal funding for most
abortions, including cases of rape or incest. However, one measure
still could draw Bush's objections by allowing the District of
Columbia to use local money for abortions.
   Abortion rights leaders said they may continue their fight to
loosen the restrictions on abortions for poor women, at least in
the Senate.
   But House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said it was time for the
pro-choice side to accept that Bush will prevail for now and devote
their energies toward another try next year.
   ``Without the votes to overturn that veto, we have to face the
fact that there's going to be a denial of funds,'' Foley said.
``The president has to take responsibility for that decision.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Bush would speak at a fund-raising event Monday for Martin and
Schneider, who are planning 1990 races for Senate seats in their
respective states.
   Both have been advocates of abortion rights. They are among
Republicans voicing concern that the party's anti-abortion platform
and identification with abortion foes hurt it in the odd-year
elections last week and may do more damage in the 1990 elections.
   ``Abortion is not a test of support ... no matter what one's
position is,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The president supports all Republicans,'' Fitzwater said. ``He
supports Republican candidates without regard to specific positions
that differ from him.'' He said Bush's own views ``are based on his
firm moral beliefs and they are not subject to change.''
   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who also attended the meeting, said
the Republicans gained no commitment from Bush and did not expect
him to reverse positions. But, she said, they hoped ``there could
be some gradations in his position'' in the future.
   ``We certainly mentioned the fact we were concerned about the
implications for our party,'' Snowe said. ``We want to avoid
political losses.''
   Also attending was Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut.
   Bush supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw most
abortions.
   The appropriations panel approved without dissent the revised
versions of a $157 billion bill for 1990 spending on labor,
education and health programs, and a bill appropriating $558
million for the District of Columbia government. Bush vetoed both
last month because of their more liberal abortion provisions.
   The House's approval of the larger bill last month marked the
first time in a decade it had voted to loosen a restriction on
federally financed abortions except in the cases where the mother's
life is in danger. But the House failed by 51 votes to override
Bush's veto.
   Abortion opponents said they still objected to the D.C. bill,
however, because it would permit the district government to use
local money to pay for abortions for poor women. Bush objected to
even that financing in his veto message, and Doug Johnson, lobbyist
for the National Right to Life Committee, said the new version
would invite yet another veto.
   On still another abortion front, the House backed away from a
threatened Bush veto on a foreign aid bill that includes $15
million for the United Nations Population Fund, a family planning
effort that opponents charge indirectly supports coerced abortions
in China.

<HEAD>Tokyo Market Index Hits Record High; Dollar Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended at
a record high Wednesday, while the dollar edged down against the
yen.
   The dollar closed at 143.37 yen, down 0.43 yen from Tuesday's
143.80-yen finish. It opened at 143.23 yen and ranged between
143.18 yen and 143.40 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 83.59 points, or 0.23
percent, closing at 35,852.23, yet another high. The index had
gained 18.52 points for a record closing of 35,768.64 Tuesday.
   ``The index rose following Tuesday's release of the domestic
wholesale price index,'' said a Nomura Securities dealer, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Japan's wholesale price index in October fell by 0.6 percentage
points from a month earlier, the first decline in 11 months.
   The dealer said the decline reassured market players that
Japan's interest rates are no longer likely to rise higher. Lower
interest rates encourage stock buying.
   In currency dealings, the dollar's drop followed a similar
downswing overnight in New York, triggered by steeper-than-expected
slides in U.S. economic data.
   The United States reported Tuesday that the nation's retail
sales fell 1 percent in October, while industrial production
dropped 0.7 percentage points that month.
   Dealers said market players were inclined to sell the dollar and
buy the yen expecting that the U.S. monetary policy will be eased.
   A Bank of Tokyo trader said the U.S. currency will contine to
move narrowly around its opening level until the release of the
U.S. trade figures for September, due out in Washington Thursday.

   An open ambulance speeds down a
narrow street, siren screaming. A bleeding woman in a rose-colored
dress lies sprawled in the back, surrounded by helmeted rescue
workers.
   What is left of downtown street life pauses for a moment as the
war wails past. A woman's hand offering a slice of papaya freezes
in midair. Eyes track the truck's swift passage.
   At the Hospital Rosales, the wounded lie on stretchers lining
the hallways. A wounded child stares vacantly into space. Someone
mops a pool of blood from the floor.
   For the first time in a decade of civil war, the capital is the
battlefield.
   Some people try to carry on, despite the fighting, despite the
rebel traffic ban and despite the government curfew and state of
seige.
   Most simply stay home. The vast majority of businesses have been
shuttered since the offensive began Saturday. Traffic is sparse.
Many of those who venture out carry improvised white flags.
   Dogs bark, rockets whistle, mortars thud and sirens wail. The
sounds are sharp, unmuffled by the usual din of traffic.
   Evening brings a rainbow that arcs from a sunlit volcano into
the cloud-darkened sky. A helicopter gunship makes a pass,
punctuating the scene with the insistence of war.
   Combat intensifies with the darkness. Many areas are without
power after rebels sabotage power lines.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker's sleep is disturbed by the sound
of a nearby rebel assault. The next morning the fence around his
home shows the scars of several bullets.
   Some areas of the city are full-fledged combat zones.
   In Zacamil, one of the neighborhoods on in northern San Salvador
occupied by leftist guerrillas, a stream of people flowed down the
hill Tuesday morning.
   They said they were afraid of another strafing run by government
gunships. They begged reporters to ask the Red Cross to help
evacuate them.
   ``Tell them there are babies here, tell them there are
children,'' one woman cried.
   Other residents stood side by side with rebel fighters.
   ``The people are making their own decision'' whether to stay or
go, insisted rebel leader Claudio Rabindranath Armijo.
   He led a mix of new recruits, some as young as 13, and
battle-hardened fighters from the countryside, the main theater of
war before this offensive.
   The fighters include people, like Armijo, from the top ranks of
the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   The sights and sounds of war have been banned from the airwaves.
All broadcasters were put under the aegis of the national network
when the offensive began and there is a virtual news blackout.
   What is broadcast is carefully selected. The head of the armed
forces general staff, Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, went on television
Monday night to say the rebels controlled no territory.
   But residents of Zacamil, where five-story apartment houses abut
settlers' tin shacks, know differently.
   Food, water and medicine in Zacamil were running short by
Tuesday, but ammunition was not, the rebels said.
   Spent shells and broken glass littered the ground. Fire crackled
from rebel sharpshooters perched in top floors. An air force
helicopter passed high overhead, out of range of rebel groundfire.
   How long, one fighter was asked, would the rebels try to hold
out?
   ``Until we win or die,'' he said.

<HEAD>Upsurge In Sports Cable Broadcasts Defended By Tagliabue, Vincent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Professional football and baseball
commissioners say the move of sports programming to cable is making
games available to more, not fewer, fans.
   National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and
Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent sat side-by-side during a Senate
Judiciary subcommittee hearing Tuesday, and were grilled by
lawmakers about the shift of baseball and football telecasts to
ESPN and other cable networks.
   The National Association of Broadcasters said in a prepared
statement that Congress should get involved because the trend was
``leading to a sports blackout for nearly half of the nation which
does not have cable.''
   NAB President Edward O. Fritts said Congress could direct the
Federal Communications Commission to reinstitute anti-siphoning
rules, which have not been in place since 1977, to assure viewers
access to sports broadcasts.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., asked Tagliabue for a ``flat
commitment'' that fans would not begin to be assessed a flat fee to
view a broadcast of pro football's jewel, the Super Bowl. Such a
``pay-per-view'' arrangement is used for some top-draw boxing
matches.
   ``For the balance of this century, we do not foresee
pay-per-view for the Super Bowl game,'' Tagliabue said. He said he
could not foresee what might happen after that.

<NOTE>Hawkins Flunks Bush as `Education President'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Education and Labor
Committee says President Bush, the would-be ``education
president,'' is blocking the education secretary from doing a good
job.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., told reporters Tuesday at the
National Press Club, ``I feel rather presumptive in grading the
president but I've been asked to do so.'' He then harshly
criticized Bush, who pledged to become the ``education president''
if elected.
   ``There is not a single accomplishment, initiative, or
educational credit with which the president can be identified, even
if the summit is so regarded,'' said Hawkins, referring to the
recent two-day meeting of Bush and the nation's governors that
resulted in a push for national performance goals.
   However, Hawkins was kinder to Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos, noting ``he and I are very, very friendly.''
   ``I think he's a fine, honorable man. I think he has good
motives,'' said Hawkins. ``I think that if he was not restrained,
he probably would do very well. I think under the restraints, he
can't.''
   Hawkins said Cavazos is being hampered by policies pushed by the
Office of Management and Budget and the White House, which ``I
think differ diametrically from his own philosophy.''

<NOTE>Congressman Would Have Coins Pay to Aid Firefighters</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sponsor of a House bill to help
firefighters wants to pay for it by having the government mint and
sell a commemorative coin.
   A bill by Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., to create a ``fireservice
bill of rights'' would be funded though sale of coins minted to
commemorate the bicentennial of the death of Benjamin Franklin.
   The coins had already been planned, and the bill would earmark
25 percent of the money for a Benjamin Franklin National Memorial,
with the rest going to help train and equip firefighters, set up a
hazardous materials communications network, and help the survivors
of firefighters killed in action.
   Weldon insisted at a hearing of the Science, Space and
Technology subcommittee on science, research and technology that
the measure was not a tax. He said the firefighters' foundation
would take private donations as well.
   The administration, through Edward M. Wall of the U.S. Fire
Administration, said such a sale would provide inadequate revenue.

   Plymouth Rock, the boulder marking the
spot where the Pilgrims landed 369 years ago, is in danger of
splitting in two. But a mason says he'll preserve it in time for
Thanksgiving.
   ``I don't look at it as a job, I look at it as a privilege to
preserve something that means a lot to people all over the United
States,'' said Paul Choquette, 42, of South Dartmouth, who planned
to start work on the rock today.
   He bid $1 to win the contract to patch up the historic landmark,
where Pilgrims are said to have first set foot on American land in
1620.
   Ronald Hirschfeld, a geotechnical engineer hired by the state's
Department of Environmental Management to analyze the rock, has
concluded that the rock's crack will worsen if left unattended.
   ``It would look terribly embarrassing if it split in half,''
said Peter O'Neil, a department spokesman.
   The crack first appeared in 1774, when the 6-ton boulder was
dropped during an attempt to move it to the town square, breaking
it in two.
   The smaller piece was used for the town display, but because
tourists kept chipping away at the monument, guardians of the rock
decided to glue it back to its partner in 1880.
   That job has stood up to the tides that occasionally submerge
the rock, which is 14 feet wide and 6 feet long and stands in a
half-enclosed protective structure in the waters off of this
seaside town.
   The mortar, however, is deteriorating. State and town officials
fear water that seeps into the rock will freeze, causing further
fissures or worse.
   The main crack is about 2{ feet long. Choquette said repairs
could be completed in one day.
   He said he's not using high-tech glues or epoxy, because
scientists want to be able to undo his work without damaging the
rock if more substantial repairs become necessary.
   He has prepared a special mortar mixed to match the color and
consistency of the 19th century repairs, but he declined to reveal
his mix, beyond saying it contained ``small pebbles.''
   Choquette, a mason for 22 years, said he also will fix a series
of hairline cracks that have developed within the main fracture and
in some other areas of the rock. The smaller cracks were caused by
the vibrations of the tourist buses that rumble over the road about
5 feet from the landmark, he said.
   Two masons submited bids. Choquette was chosen after the other
mason asked for about $100.
   ``It just makes me feel good,'' Choquette said. ``It's just
knowing what it stands for. It's a symbol of freedom and how
America supposedly started off.''

<HEAD>Medicines Turn Back Damage of Too Much Cholesterol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three studies provide new dramatic evidence
that people with heart disease who cut down on cholesterol can
actually begin to clean out the clogged arteries that threaten
their lives.
   ``All three studies show that whether you use diet or drugs, you
can lower cholesterol dramatically,'' said Dr. Basil M. Rifkind of
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. ``The greater your
reduction in cholesterol, the greater your reduction in heart
disease.''
   Cholesterol kills by plugging up the blood vessels that feed the
heart's own muscle. The latest studies show that when people take
cholesterol-lowering medicines or go on strict vegetarian diets,
they can stop new fatty deposits from building up in their arteries.
   Often they can actually turn back the clock, eliminating some of
the damage of a lifetime of too much cholesterol.
   ``We are excited about these results,'' said Dr. Daniel
Steinberg of the University of California, San Diego. ``They
strengthen our resolve to try to save more lives by lowering
cholesterol.''
   The studies were cited by some of the nation's top heart experts
as they sought to quiet doubts that have been raised about the
wisdom _ or need _ of lowering everyone's cholesterol.
   The three reports were presented Tuesday at the annual
scientific meeting of the American Heart Association, along with a
joint statement by the heart association and the heart institute.
   The report, called ``The Cholesterol Facts,'' was intended to
rebut a September article in Atlantic Monthly.
   In the article, ``The Cholesterol Myth,'' Washington-based
writer Thomas J. Moore argued there is no firm proof that lowering
blood cholesterol levels saves lives or that people live longer by
changing what they eat. The doctors countered that evidence to the
contrary is overwhelming.
   Their point-by-point challenge of Moore's report concluded that
``the evidence more than justifies the current national campaign
for cholesterol control.''
   Six of the nation's most prominent heart experts presented the
joint statement and outlined the case against cholesterol.
   ``If you give the message that cholesterol is a myth, it is
wrong. It is important that we detect and treat it,'' said Dr. John
C. LaRosa of George Washington University.
   Moore could not be reached to respond. There was no answer at
his Washington office, the only location his publisher said he
could be reached at.
   The doctors cited 36 different studies, including several not
mentioned in Moore's article. They said he had ignored some of the
most persuasive data, including animal and population studies, and
misread other research.
   ``There is overwhelming data that in addition to lessening your
heart attack risk in your 40s, 50s and 60s, you will live a little
longer by following a better diet,'' said another panel member, Dr.
William Castelli of the Framingham Heart Study in suburban Boston.
   Two of the studies presented Tuesday relied on medicines to
lower cholesterol in people at a high risk of heart trouble.
   Dr. Greg Brown of the University of Washington put people on two
combinations of cholesterol-lowering drugs. Over five years, the
fatty buildups shrank in 35 percent and got bigger in 23 percent.
   Dr. David Blankenhorn and colleagues from the University of
Southern California also found a significant slowing of the disease
in people treated for four years with cholesterol medicine.
   In the third study, Dr. Dean Ornish of the University of
California, San Francisco, put subjects on strict vegetarian diets
and had them participate in exercise and relaxation programs. After
one year, 82 percent showed overall regression of artery deposits.
   Even though these and many other studies were conducted on
people at the highest risk of heart trouble, the doctors contended
that sensible eating and lower cholesterol are good for everyone.
   ``Not only does diet make a difference, it is the major approach
to cholesterol lowering across the board,'' said Dr. Scott M.
Grundy of the University of Texas in Dallas.

<HEAD>Bad News For Drinkers: Booze Linked With Enlarged Heart</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For those who enjoy a drink or two each day,
the latest news from medical research is bad _ especially if they
are over age 50.
   The research suggests that drinking causes dangerous enlargement
of the heart. And the doctors who conducted the study say it
convinces them that older people should give up booze entirely for
the sake of their hearts.
   The study found an association between alcohol consumption and
enlargement of the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber.
   ``Even the smallest doses of alcohol seem to have some effect on
left ventricular mass,'' said Dr. Teri A. Manolio of the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.
   The findings were based on information from 1,968 men and 2,505
women who took part in the Framingham Heart Study in suburban
Boston.
   ``Age is also a factor,'' said Manolio, ``and our conclusion is
that anyone past the age of 50 or so _ and certainly anyone who
already has an enlarged heart _ would be better off not drinking at
all.''
   Left ventricular enlargement is associated with dangerous
irregular heart rhythms. The more ventricular size increases, the
greater the risk of heart failure and death.
   The link was most pronounced in men. While women's hearts appear
to be less susceptible to the bad effects of alcohol, the
researchers said this may simply be because women typically drink
less than men.
   The research was presented Tuesday at the annual scientific
meeting of the American Heart Association.

<HEAD>`Batman' Fans Line up For Video</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Bat fans fluttered around video
stores early today to swoop in and pick up the first available
copies of ``Batman _ The Videocassette.''
   A spotlight outside the Tower Video store in Los Angeles cast
the Batman logo on the sky above Sunset Boulevard while the
Batmobile rolled up and the Joker jumped out, bearing bags filled
with the coveted Batvideos.
   Fans also lined up elsewhere.
   ``We sold 100 within the first 40 minutes,'' said Todd Gerber,
department supervisor at Tower Video in Nashville, Tenn.
   But as the videocassette was released nationally at midnight
Tuesday, its expected blockbuster sales were making some in the
entertainment industry as grim as the Caped Crusader himself.
   ``Batman'' is still playing in more than 500 North American
theaters, according to the latest box-office figures. The
blockbuster movie's speedy arrival in cassette form could mean
those cinemas are out of luck _ and customers.
   ``You can look at the lines in the video stores and think that
those people would be going to the theaters if that were the only
source for the movie,'' said Randy Hester, an executive of the
640-theater Cinemark U.S.A. chain in Dallas.
   ``The video release will really hurt discount houses, where
`Batman' is now playing,'' said Hester, who couldn't estimate the
revenue loss.
   Warner Home Video is releasing ``Batman'' five weeks ahead of
the usual six-month wait between a film's theatrical debut and
video premiere. ``Batman'' is the fifth-most successful film in
box-office history, grossing mor than $250 million.
   Other 1989 hits such as ``Ghostbusters II'' and ``When Harry Met
Sally ...'' also are being rushed to video ahead of the usual wait.
   The ``Batman'' video carries a suggested retail price of $24.98,
and sales are expected to challenge the all-time record of 15
million copies held by ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.'' Warner Home
Video has refused to say how many tapes it is shipping.
   In Los Angeles, Tower Video has converted the entire store into
a giant ``Batman'' display complete with Gotham City sets. It had
3,000 copies of the video at $16.95 each.

   After replacing a flawed computer on its
last unmanned rocket, NASA set Saturday for the launch of the first
of several satellites that will reveal an ``unbelievable view of
the universe.''
   ``Hold on to your hats because this is going to shake up the
world of science,'' program scientist Larry Caroff said of the
Cosmic Background Explorer spacecraft and four observatories that
will be placed in Earth orbit during the 1990s.
   Saturday's launch of the $150 million Explorer spacecraft _ the
centerpiece of a $400 million mission _ ``is going to begin an
explosion of knowledge about the universe,'' program manager David
Gilman told reporters Tuesday at the space agency's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The 4,850-pound Explorer will provide clues to the development
of the universe by measuring radiation left over from the ``big
bang,'' the explosion scientists say created the universe 15
billion years ago.
   Gilman said the Explorer will be followed by the launches of
what NASA calls its ``great observatories'' _ the Hubble Space
Telescope next March, the Gamma Ray Observatory in June, the
Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility in 1997 and the Space Infrared
Telescope Facility in 1999.
   ``These are going to provide us with an unprecedented,
unbelievable view of the universe,'' Caroff said in an interview.
``We will see things we haven't even imagined.''
   The Explorer is scheduled for launch from Vandenberg Air Force
Base during a 30-minute period starting at 6:24 a.m. PST Saturday,
said Roger Mattson, project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   The launch had been scheduled for Friday, then was delayed until
Sunday because of a malfunctioning rocket guidance computer. But
the computer was replaced so quickly last weekend that the launch
was moved again, said Peter Eaton, a NASA rocket official.
   The solar-powered satellite will be carried into a near-polar
orbit by a 116-foot-tall Delta rocket _ the last unmanned,
expendable rocket ever to be launched by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
   NASA will continue to launch manned shuttles and possibly
unmanned cargo shuttles with reusable boosters. But Air Force or
private companies will charge NASA to launch any payloads that
require unmanned expendable rockets.
   After a 30-day shakedown in orbit, the Explorer will spend up to
two years measuring ``cosmic background radiation,'' which makes up
about 2 percent of the static on a television set. It includes
microwaves, heat and other electromagnetic radiation given off by
the big bang.
   The Explorer will measure ``the collective glow of all the stars
and galaxies and whatever else has been there since the
beginning,'' project scientist John Mather said.
   He said NASA will share information from the mission with the
Soviet Union, which has flown one similar research mission and
plans two others.

<HEAD>Stocks in Tokyo Hit Record High; Dollar Closes Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rose to a
record high today, while the dollar closed lower against the
Japanese yen.
   The dollar ended trading at 143.37 yen, down 0.43 yen from
Tuesday's close of 143.80 yen. The currency opened lower at 143.23
yen and ranged between 143.18 yen and 143.40 yen.
   ``Trading today was totally directionless and boring,'' said a
trader with Mitsui Bank in Tokyo on condition of anonymity. ``Ahead
of the release of the U.S. trade figures, the dollar-yen rate moved
only narrowly.''
   The trader said Tokyo is expecting the U.S. trade deficit for
September to shrink to $8.5 billion. Washington's trade figure
announcement is scheduled for Thursday.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues gained 83.59 points, or 0.23 percent. It ended at 35,852.23,
renewing the record high for the third-consecutive time since
Monday.
   The index, which has been rising since last Wednesday, has
gained more than 580 points.
   The index slowed its upward movement in the afternoon session as
participants sold for profit-taking and arbitrary deals, which
resulted in wild fluctuations in the index, dealers said.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities, said market
players' buying incentive was not strong enough for a larger
one-day gain even after a report that Japan's wholesale price index
fell by 0.6 percentage points from a month earlier. It was the
first drop in the last 11 months.
   ``Investors wouldn't start buying all of a sudden just because
of the wholesale price index, becuase our domestic short term
interst rate hasn't fallen,'' he said.
   ``Market players will increase buying gradually as they make
sure external economic factors are stable enough,'' Nomura added.
   An estimated 1.2 billion shares changed hands on the first
section, up from Tuesday's 900 million. Among the winners were
construction, railway and financial issues.

<BYLINE>Columbia Astronauts Hope to Bring Back Giant ``Christmas Present''
^By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The astronauts aboard next month's
space shuttle mission hope to return home with a bus-size Christmas
present _ a satellite carrying a bounty of space experiments begun
nearly six years ago.
   Columbia's five astronauts, scheduled to begin their 10-day
flight Dec. 18, are charged with the task of retrieving what NASA
calls the Long Duration Exposure Facility.
   The 11-ton, 30-foot-long payload carrying 57 experiments was
placed in orbit during a 1984 shuttle mission. It was to be
retrieved in a year, but that plan was scuttled due to schedule
changes and the Challenger explosion in 1986 that killed all seven
crew members.
   The craft is falling from orbit and is expected to crash back
into the Earth's atmosphere in February if the Columbia astronauts
don't snatch it.
   ``We hope that even though we'll be gone from our families and
loved ones for Christmas, that we'll be able to bring back a great
big Christmas present,'' commander Dan Brandenstein said Tuesday.
   The other crew members are pilot James Wetherbee and mission
specialists Bonnie Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and G. David Low. They
spoke at a news conference and in interviews Tuesday at the Johnson
Space Center.
   More than 200 scientists have been waiting years to see how
their science, technology and materials experiments have fared
during the long exposure to the space environment. Such information
could be used to build a planned space station or other long-term
spacecraft.
   ``The vehicle is invaluable to us,'' said the mission's flight
director, Al Pennington. ``Almost every material known has been
sitting up there in space being bombarded by atomic oxygen and
other space materials for six years.''
   Low said if the crew doesn't snag the satellite, it will be a
loss to science and a blow to U.S. prestige. The crew will attempt
to retrieve the payload on the mission's fourth day.
   ``It's a completely passive satellite and no data has been
transmitted to Earth,'' Low said. ``So it's a complete loss of that
mission if we don't get it back.''
   The chances of satellite chunks hitting anything on Earth are
remote because it flies mostly over oceans, he said.
   ``But I think it's poor form to let something like that come
back,'' Low said.
   The crew also will deploy a Navy communications satellite.
   To track down the old satellite, Brandenstein and Wetherbee will
complete a complex set of maneuvers. Dunbar is in charge of using a
60-foot robot arm to grab it and pull it into the cargo bay.
   Columbia will follow another holiday shuttle flight into space.
A secret Defense Department mission to be flown by a five-man
Discovery crew is scheduled to lift off Nov. 22, the night before
Thanksgiving.

   Rebels today tried to fan the
flames of their 4-day-old offensive into a popular insurrection.
President Alfredo Cristiani called the insurgent push the act of
``a desperate beast.''
   Both Cristiani's rightist administration and the Marxist-led
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front claimed widespread
popular support. More than 500 people have been reported killed and
1,000 wounded in the fighting.
   The government battled guerrillas holding poor districts on the
capital's northern outskirts on Tuesday, the military's helicopter
gunships pouring fire on at least one working-class neighborhood.
   Thousands of residents remained trapped in their homes by the
heavy fighting and civilian casualties were high. The government
declared a 24-hour curfew in seven northern neighborhoods where
guerrilla fighters had dug in.
   Fighting was also reported in eastern provinces, to which travel
is restricted.
   Rebel commander Ana Guadalupe Martinez, speaking early today on
the insurgents' clandestine Radio Venceremos, said the guerrillas
had declared more than a quarter of the Massachusetts-sized country
``liberated.''
   She said revolutionary committees had been set up in dozens of
towns.
   ``We call on the popular committees to give priority to the task
of supporting the combatants ... to form militias, to construct
workshops of popular armament, to collect food, medicine and
bandages and organize the means of getting them to the combat
zones,'' she said.
   Cristiani said the offensive, begun Saturday night, ``has been a
failure'' for the guerrillas.
   ``The harshest blow to them has been the repudiation of the
people,'' he said in a speech broadcast nationwide Tuesday night.
``This (the offensive) is the act of a desperate beast.''
   The combat, a state of siege, a dusk-to-dawn curfew and a
guerrilla-imposed road transport ban made circulation difficult, at
times impossible.
   These conditions hampered efforts to gauge the degree to which
the general population was being swayed toward either side.
   The streets were deserted overnight for the third straight night.
   Red flares dropped by helicopters drifted over the Mejicanos
neighborhood and tracer-laced bursts from the gunships' .30-caliber
machine guns sporadically blasted the working-class district.
   Mejicanos was one of several neighborhoods on the capital's
periphery where insurgents were entrenched.
   The fighting was been the fiercest since the rebels' ``final
offensive'' of January 1981 failed to win them power.
   At least 500 people have been killed in the battle of San
Salvador, with nearly double that number wounded, according to the
military hospitals and morgue reports.
   A 10-year-old civil war between the rebels and a succession of
U.S.-backed governments has claimed an estimated 70,000 people,
most of them civilians.
   Rebel leaders ordered the offensive after announcing they would
not participate in peace talks scheduled for next week in
Venezuela. They said Cristiani's government was not negotiating
seriously and blamed it for the Oct. 31 bombing of a union
headquarters that killed 10 people and wounded 29.
   Two leftist political leaders who had been operating publicly
since late 1987 took refuge in the Mexican and Venezuelan
embassies. The leaders, Guillermo Ungo and Ruben Zamora, have not
asked for asylum, and are described by their hosts as ``guests.''
   Many leaders of union, peasant and student organizations
considered guerrilla fronts by the government have gone underground
this week.
   Cristiani, a rightist who took office June 1, said government
forces had ``neutralized'' insurgents on San Salvador's
southeastern, southern and western periphery, but that combat
continued with dug-in rebels on the northern outskirts.
   ``The army is advancing, but advancing slowly,'' he said. He
accused the guerrillas of holding civilians ``hostage'' and of
using them as ``screens'' against army counteroffensives.
   ``There is no danger whatever of the government being toppled,''
he said.
   Cristiani denied air force planes and helicopters had bombarded
civilian zones where the guerrillas are dug in. He acknowledged
that rebel positions were strafed.
   Gen. Humberto Larios, minister of defense, said helicopters have
fired rockets at guerrilla positions.
   Nearly 100 civilians have been killed and more than 680 wounded
in San Salvador since Saturday night, many reportedly casualties of
air attacks.
   The New York-based human rights organization Americas Watch on
Tuesday called on both the armed forces and the rebels to respect
the articles of the Geneva Conventions obliging belligerents to
take all measures possible to prevent civilian casualties.
   Pedro Varela, spokesman for the Salvadoran Red Cross, said the
local organization had appealed to the International Red Cross in
Geneva to mediate a 72-hour truce between the government and the
guerrilla command.
   He said the International Red Cross agreed to try to arrange the
measure, which would be used to evacuated wounded and civilians
from combat zones.

<TEXT>
   Bernard ``Barnie'' Akers, one of the
original Duncan yo-yo men who died at age 80, was remembered as a
man with a smile on his face and a yo-yo in each hand.
   Akers died Friday at a Huntington hospital. A memorial service
has not been scheduled.
   Akers' uncle, Donald F. Duncan, popularized the toy in America
during the Great Depression and set up an exhibition schedule with
dozens of men traveling from town-to-town, telling stories and
selling yo-yos.
   Stuart Crump, editor of Yo-Yo Times, a Washington, D.C.-based
magazine for yo-yo enthusiasts, said Tuesday that Akers was one of
the best.
   ``He was probably the most important link with the great yo-yo
years,'' Crump said. ``He actually almost single-handedly created
the yo-yo contest,'' a competition designed to increase yo-yo sales.
   ``I will remember him with a smile on his face and two yo-yos in
his hands,'' said Crump, who last saw Akers last winter while in
Charleston to record music to yo-yo by.
   Akers never married. He said in an interview last summer that a
yo-yo man's life, like the toy, is up and down.
   ``I had a few girlfriends, but they didn't realize that if you
do something like this 10 months a year, it gets tiring. I would
travel 800 miles in a day just to get to a new market,'' Akers said.
   ``If you get married, a woman thinks she would like that, like
it was a two-week vacation. Not many would like it. Not for 50
years.''
   Akers had surgery for prostate problems during the summer and
fought lymphoma. He died in the hospital, but his brother,
Franklin, another yo-yo man who left the trade, said he believed
Akers died of a weak heart.
   Barnie Akers didn't like calling the yo-yo a toy, saying it
taught too many skills _ like eye-and-hand coordination and
discipline.
   In his spiels, he used to give a history of the yo-yo, telling
how ancient vases discovered in Greece show wooden knobs suspended
on strings.
   ``Go back before the birth of Christ and you can see how the
string is tied on their fingers,'' Akers said.

   A young boy's screams as he was being
carried from a movie theater led to the arrest of a man on charges
he killed three other youngsters, police said.
   Westley Allan Dodd, a 28-year-old Vancouver resident with a long
history of sexual offenses involving children, was charged with
three counts of first-degree aggravated murder in the deaths of
three young Portland-Vancouver area boys, authorities said.
   Police said Dodd was apprehended Monday night after he carried a
5-year-old boy from a theater restroom in Camas, 15 miles east of
Vancouver.
   ``The boy started screaming, `Help me! help me!''' said the
theater's co-owner, Cathy Asher, ``and we took off running after
the guy.''
   The child was able to escape and was not injured.
   After getting a description of the man's car, William Graves,
the boyfriend of the boy's mother, found that it had broken down a
few blocks away.
   Camas police Lt. Mike Slyter said Graves caught Dodd after a
little struggle. He returned Dodd to the theater, where bystanders
tied a belt around his hands and held him until police arrived.
   ``You have to admire this man,'' Asher said of Graves.
   Police also credited the boy for raising such a fuss as he was
being carried away.
   ``The boy is a hero, I would say,'' Slyter said.
   Dodd is charged with killing 4-year-old Lee Joseph Iseli, whose
nude body was found just west of Vancouver on Nov. 1, three days
after he disappeared from a school playground in Portland, Ore.
   The boy had been strangled. Investigators declined to say
whether he had been molested.
   Dodd also was charged with killing 10-year-old William Neer and
11-year-old Cole Neer of Vancouver, who were stabbed to death on
Labor Day in a park a few blocks from where Dodd lived. At the
time, investigators said there was no evidence the brothers had
been molested.
   In addition, Dodd was charged with first-degree kidnapping in
connection with Monday night's incident.
   Authorities said Dodd had been convicted in 1987 of attempted
unlawful imprisonment after admitting he fondled an 8-year-old boy
in Seattle. Court records show he admitted to having a sexually
deviant interest in young boys. He served about four months in jail
and was sentenced to complete a program on sexual deviancy.
   In 1984, he was convicted of lewd contact with a minor in
Lewiston, Idaho. His 10-year jail sentence was commuted to not more
than a year on the condition that he enter a psychiatric program.
   Police searched Dodd's studio apartment Tuesday.
   His landlady, Vivian Shay, said he worked as a shipping clerk at
a Vancouver paper company and had moved into the apartment about
two months ago.
   ``The little I've talked with him, he's as nice a person as I've
had in here in a long time,'' she said.
   Shay said she had discussed the Neer slayings with Dodd.
   ``He said he thought it was awful that those little boys got
killed in the park,'' she said. ``He said he hoped they found the
guy that did it.''

   Pennsylvania's abortion bill passed the
House 143-58 on Oct. 24 and the Senate 33-17 on Tuesday. Gov.
Robert P. Casey has said he will sign the bill.
   The bill would:
   _Ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy, except in cases
where the mother faces irreversible harm or death. Doctors who
violate the guidelines would be guilty of a third degree felony,
punishable by up to 7 years in prison and up to $15,000 in fines.
   _Require doctors to inform women about the procedure before
performing an abortion, provide her with the likely age of the
fetus and explain risks and alternatives.
   _Prohibit abortions because of the fetus' sex, proving a prison
term of up to seven years with up to $15,000 in fines for doctors
who violate the provision.
   _Establish a 24-hour wait from the time a woman asks for an
abortion until it is performed.
   _Require women to notify their husbands if they plan to get an
abortion, although there are exceptions. A physician who failed to
get a form indicating the husband's notification would be liable
for civil damages to the husband, punitive damages of $5,000 and
suspension or loss of license.
   _Regulate the medical use of tissue from aborted fetuses.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer who began kidney dialysis 18
years ago because he had good medical insurance and was considered
a worthy risk for treatment eventually became a crusader for others
less fortunate.
   But now 48-year-old Paul Feinsmith finds himself in need.
   On Tuesday, he was in Pittsburgh awaiting a liver and kidney
transplant, his only hope against liver cancer. But Medicare, the
federal insurance program that pays medical costs for people with
advanced kidney disease, excludes coverage of liver transplants.
   So after years of working on others' behalf, Feinsmith has to
raise money for himself.
   ``As ill as he is, and has been for years, he still has been
responsible, almost single-handedly, for intervening with Congress
to prevent cuts from (kidney) programs,'' said Spero Moutsatsos,
project director for the End Stage Renal Disease Network of Florida
in Tampa.
   Feinsmith has served as president of the American Association of
Kidney Patients and was the first president of the National Kidney
Foundation of Florida.
   ``If you were white, middle-class, married and insured, you got
on dialysis. If not, you died,'' he said recently at his Hollywood
home, above the noise of a dialysis machine during one of his three
weekly treatments.
   Dialysis gave Feinsmith a chance at a full life. It has allowed
him to watch two teen-age children grow and go on to college at
Duke University and Ithaca College. He also has a daughter, 4, with
his second wife, Alicia.
   Although Medicare usually pays for kidney transplants, the
agency originally denied compensation to Feinsmith because he
needed a double transplant of his liver and kidneys.
   Feinsmith conducted a tireless telephone campaign and enlisted
the aid of political and medical allies to convince Medicare to pay
about $80,000 for the kidney transplant.
   But rather than exult, Feinsmith was enraged.
   ``It's outrageous,'' he said ``If it weren't for me and the
people I know ... some poor shnook who didn't have connections
wouldn't get this.''
   But that wasn't the only battle Feinsmith faced.
   He needed a $100,000 downpayment to be considered a liver
transplant candidate at the University of Pittsburgh, where he was
evaluated. The operation ultimately could cost more than $200,000,
plus extra expenses for transportation, lodging and medication.
   Feinsmith and his father, Sydney, a retired North Miami Beach
cantor, have raised almost $200,000. An undisclosed amount came
from ``an angel, out of the blue,'' who anonymously left a large
check at a North Miami Beach pizza parlor, Feinsmith said.
   He also has gained support from doctors nationwide, said his
doctor, Allan Jacob.
   ``He's unique, he's not just another individual with a difficult
medical problem,'' Jacob said. ``In the area of public policy and
dialysis, he's an expert. Every major nationally reknowned
nephrologist on patient and government issues has rallied around
him.''

<HEAD>Protesters Demanding End To U.S. Food Imports Attack U.S. Air Base</HEAD>

   Students and farmers demanding an end
to U.S. food imports battled police with firebombs and rocks today
in Seoul and other areas as protesters staged a running attack on a
U.S. Air Force base.
   A small group of radical students demanding a ban on food
imports hurled several firebombs and rocks at the main gate of the
U.S. Air base in Kunsan, about 130 miles south of Seoul, police
said.
   Five students were arrested by South Korean police. U.S.
officials reported minor damage to a guardhouse, but no injuries.
   About 2,000 students and farmers hurling firebombs and rocks
battled riot police at Konkuk University in eastern Seoul after
they were prevented from marching into the street to call for the
overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo's government.
   Hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues and black,
visored helmets made repeated charges to drive the protesters back
as armored police vans fired barrages of tear gas bombs.
   ``Drive out the Yankees who enforce the opening of agricultural
markets,'' protesters chanted.
   Police officials said more than 300 farmers and students were
arrested in Seoul for taking part in anti-government protests. The
police said they had no information on injuries.
   Protesters gathered at Konkuk after the government deployed some
7,000 riot police to block a farmers' protest on Yoido Plaza near
the city center. Police banned the rally as a threat to law and
order.
   Farmers' groups called the rally to demand an end to U.S.
imports and also seek an increase in prices for domestic farm
products. The groups claim cheap U.S. imports threaten to drive
South Korean farmers out of business.
   Police blocked the rally after Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon
ordered security forces Tuesday to launch a crackdown to block
anti-government rallies by students, workers and farmers.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said farmers' groups held
protests in other parts of the country, occupying government and
political party offices.
   The agency said farmers fought police in at least a score of
cities and towns, but gave no details.
   About 100 farmers occupied an opposition party office in Naju
near the southern city Kwangju after police stopped them from
leaving for Seoul, Yonhap said. Farmers also occupied a government
headquarters in Haenam.
   Police checkpoints blocked farmers from entering Seoul to take
part in the rally.
   The United States is pressing for greater access to South Korean
markets to help correct Seoul's $8 billion trade surplus with
Washington. The South Korean government is reluctant to open
agricultural markets because of domestic political opposition.
   Radical students are supporting the farmers to try and expand
anti-government forces. But the students have little support and
are not seen as a serious threat to the government.

   Failure to follow regulations proved fatal for
two police officers shot to death while driving a prisoner back to
jail, authorities said.
   ``These two detectives got careless for a minute or two and it
cost them their lives,'' Poice Commissioner Richard Condon said
Tuesday. ``If you make a mistake in this business, it can have
terrible results.''
   Jay ``Stoney'' Harrison, 25, was charged with killing the
detectives and was arraigned Tuesday evening. He later pleaded
innocent and was returned to Rikers Island jail without bail.
   Harrison maintained that the officers were shot during a robbery
by a gunman who freed him, said Assistant District Attorney Bob
Alexander.
   Harrison was arrested late Monday at his girlfriend's home in
the New York City borough of Brooklyn after a 10-hour citywide hunt.
   He had been brought to a district attorney's office Monday to
take a lie detector test and discuss a plea bargain, but a series
of police mistakes allowed him to find a loaded gun in a police
locker with a defective lock, authorities said.
   The errors began when Harrison was left alone in a detectives'
squad room, authorities said. Prisoners kept in the room are
usually handcuffed to a pipe out of reach of the lockers, but
Harrison was left cuffed by just one hand to let him eat lunch,
police said.
   The suspect either wasn't searched or poorly searched before his
return to jail, and he was alone in the back seat of the car, a
violation of police policy, authorities said.
   Asked if the errors had killed the two decorated officers,
Condon replied, ``Yes.'' He announced a policy change that bans
interrogating or holding prisoners in rooms with lockers.
   Killed were Detectives Keith L. Williams, 34, of New York City,
and Richard J. Guerzon, 46, of Merrick. Authorities said Harrison
fired at least five shots from the stolen gun. Both officers were
dead at the scene.
   Harrison was arraigned on four counts of second-degree murder:
one each for killing the detectives and two of felony murder, or
murder in the furtherance of a crime _ escape, said John Hayes,
Queens Criminal Court clerk. Harrison also was arraigned on the
charges of first-degree escape and second-degree criminal weapon
possession, Hayes said.
   The maximum penalty for murder in New York is 25 years to life.
   The Detectives Endowment Association said it would set up a fund
for their families. Guerzon, a 20-year veteran, was married, with
four children; Williams, an eight-year veteran, was married and had
a daughter.
   Gary Schoer, a lawyer temporarily representing Harrison, asked
the judge to appoint a public defender.
   Schoer's law partner, Michael Sileo, is Harrison's lawyer in
other criminal cases but said he had decided not to represent him
in the detective killings, for reasons he would not discuss.
   Harrison's record dates from 1980. In October, he and his mother
were arrested on charges of conspiring to kill a witness against
him in the July slaying of Harrison's girlfriend.

<TEXT>
   After 4-year-old Christopher Hoy was
seriously injured in a two-car accident two years ago, he sued the
driver of the car in which he was riding _ his mom.
   On Tuesday, Christopher won a $75,000 settlement of the lawsuit
against his parents. He also won a $50,000 settlement against the
driver of the second car. Both parties' insurance carriers will pay
the boy the money.
   The case was tried last week in state Supreme Court, and his
mother, Barbara J. Hoy, testified she was not speeding before the
accident, as her son's lawsuit claimed.
   Christopher, who is now 6, was placed in the unusual position of
suing his parents over the accident because the court decided his
mother was partly responsible for the crash, said his lawyer,
Edward Menkin.
   A jury had ruled Barbara Hoy was 30 percent responsible for the
accident, and the other driver, Sharon M. Hawthorne, was 70 percent
responsible.
   Because the court decided the mother was partially to blame, the
boy had to sue both parties, Menkin said.
   Barbara Hoy and her husband, Norman, were pleased when the suit
was settled with the $125,000 going to their son.
   ``We're happy about the result,'' said Hoy, who was named as a
defendant because he owned the car. ``It's common for occupants of
a vehicle to sue the driver. This just happened to be mother and
son.''
   Christopher suffered a broken leg, broken nose and broken back
in the Jan. 5, 1987, accident. He spent nine days in a hospital and
three months in a body cast, and has recovered from the injuries
except for a fused spine, Menkin said.

   U.S. Sen. Claiborne Pell announced he
will seek a sixth term, citing his desire to work on higher
education standards and continue presiding over the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
   ``I've decided after a lot of reflection and thought to present
myself again as a candidate in order to continue my work to
increase the quality of education and to extend college education
to more of our young people,'' the Democrat said Tuesday, squashing
rumors that he would retire.
   ``I also wish to play a part in responding to the changing
political landscape in Eastern Europe,'' Pell said.
   The senator, who turns 71 next week, is best known for the
legislation that created the system of Pell grants for college
students.
   A likely opponent is 42-year-old Rep. Claudine Schneider,
R-R.I., who said Tuesday she hasn't decided whether to run for the
Senate. She has raised at least $325,000; Pell has at least
$444,000.

   A fire that injured 31 people on the
amphibious assault ship USS Inchon apparently was caused by a short
circuit in an electrical compartment, the Navy said.
   Twelve people were hospitalized; the others treated and released.
   The fire, which started about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday and was
extinguished in about 40 minutes, was one of a series of recent
accidents that prompted the Navy later in the day to order a
48-hour halt to all normal operations for a review of safety
procedures.
   In the past three weeks, the Navy has experienced 10 serious
accidents in which 10 people have been killed or lost at sea and at
least 53 have been injured. The recent series of accidents followed
the April 19 explosion on the battleship USS Iowa in which 47
sailors died.
   The Inchon fire broke out as the ship was in the Metroc Machine
Corp. shipyard for routine repair work.
   Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet,
said the blaze apparently was caused by a short circuit and that
most of the damage was to electrical cables and insulation in the
shore power compartment. There also was smoke and heat damage to
the hangar deck.
   The compartment holds cables from the pier bringing electricity
to the ship.
   Lt. Cmdr. John Lloyd, another Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said 23
sailors and eight civilians were taken to area hospitals. The
condition of the 12 admitted for smoke inhalation ranged from
stable to serious, according to the hospitals.
   The 602-foot troop and helicopter carrier has a crew of 675 and
can hold up to 2,000 Marines and 20 helicopters when on deployment.
   The Inchon entered the shipyard Sept. 21 for a four-month
overhaul.

   Thousands of people are expected to
participate in a walk across the 8.5-mile San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge, which lost a 50-foot section in the Oct. 17 earthquake that
tore through northern California.
   The walk Thursday over the Bay Bridge that links Oakland and San
Francisco will cost $5 and feature entertainers Carol Channing and
Tony Bennett. It will be limited to 40,000 people.
   Some of the fees will go to quake relief, but the main purpose
seemed to be to celebrate the bridge's scheduled Saturday reopening
to traffic and the spirit of Bay area residents in dealing with the
quake.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner hailed the cooperation
that mended the bridge.
   ``Bureaucracy has been beaten,'' Skinner told a news conference
Tuesday.
   ``It looks great,'' he said while flanked by the mayors of San
Francisco, Oakland and Alameda on the upper deck's newly installed
concrete.
   He referred to the re-opening as Nov. 17, a month after the
7.1-magnitude earthquake that killed 66 people and caused $7
billion in damage, unaware that the state Department of
Transportation earlier in the day pushed the date to Nov. 18.
   Cars and other vehicles will start rolling across the bridge
``as soon as possible'' on Saturday, said Burch Bachtold, the state
Department of Transportation district director who guided Skinner
during his brief visit to the 53-year-old bridge.
   Department officials said the delay was needed because two days
of damp weather slowed work on the bridge.
   The span's repair represents a ``magnificent effort by state,
local and federal officials,'' said Skinner.

   Identical twin brothers who have
monopolized the mayor's office here for 42 years will continue
their small-town dynasty following a 26-vote election victory.
   ``I'm surprised I didn't win by a greater majority, but a win is
a win,'' Knox Ridley said Tuesday night after being re-elected to a
four-year term.
   Unofficial returns showed that Ridley received 1,185 votes to
Denise Esker's 1,159. Mrs. Esker, a homemaker and former city
employee making her first bid for political office, said she would
decide today whether to seek a recount.
   Ridley, who served on the Rutherford County Court for a
quarter-century and was a justice of the peace, was appointed
interim mayor two years ago to replace his brother Sam, who was
ousted for misusing public money.
   The 70-year-old twins, born 30 minutes apart, are still close.
They dress similarly, wear glasses and have gray, balding hair.
Knox is described by locals as ``the one with the hearing aid.''
   It's little wonder, then, that townsfolk speculate that Sam
Ridley, who held the post for 40 years, still pulls the strings.
Sam became mayor in 1947 but was ousted after the courts found he
misused $11,000 from the city's 1980 budget.
   Knox Ridley doesn't try to distance himself from his brother,
referring to Sam as his ``chief of staff.'' Sam campaigned actively
for Knox.
   The cozy relationship between the brothers was the main issue
for Mrs. Esker.
   ``It's still as crooked now as it was then,'' she said during
the campaign.
   Mrs. Esker said the close vote scared the Ridleys. ``I think
they will have even more people watching them now,'' she said.
   She had hammered on the theme that Smyrna needed a change in
leadership, noting the town outside Nashville had 500 people when
Sam Ridley became mayor. Today, Smyrna is a growing city of 13,000,
boasting a sprawling new plant where Nissan produces light trucks
and cars.
   Knox Ridley agrees the times are changing, but says he _
referrring to himself in the the plural _ has changed, too.
   ``We might have old age, but we have a young heart and a young
mind,'' he said.

   Freezing temperatures settled on the Northern states and the
Rockies this morning after several days of record high temperatures
around the country.
   A cold air mass over Canada was nosing its way into Montana and
North Dakota today, and sharply colder temperatures were expected
by week's end in much of the nation east of the Rockies.
   Warm and moist air ahead of the arctic mass was expected to
bring severe thunderstorms, damaging winds and even tornadoes from
the Mississippi Valley into the Southeast.
   Snowfall totals of 3 to 8 inches were expected today in
northwest Wisconsin, with winds blowing and drifting the snow. More
than a foot of snow was possible in upper Michigan.
   Temperatures dipped below freezing this morning across the
Dakotas and 40 mph winds produced wind chill readings of 15 to 35
degrees below zero.
   Light snow fell Tuesday night over Minnesota, eastern North
Dakota, northwest Wisconsin, and parts of Colorado. Up to 4{ inches
of new snow blanketed some ski areas, with winds of up to 50 mph.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the lower and
middle Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic Coast on Tuesday night.
   Temperatures warmed above 70 degrees Tuesday across the Atlantic
Coast, with highs in the 80s across Florida.
   Nineteen cities _ including Syracuse, N.Y.; Tampa, Fla.; Tulsa,
Okla., and Dallas _ reported new record high temperatures for the
date.
   Temperatures also warmed into the 70s and 80s in the Southwest
but were in the 30s across much of the northern Plains, the upper
Mississippi Valley, and across northern Maine.

<HEAD>Soybean Farmers' Lawsuit Accuses BOT of Illegal Price Manipulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade is denying farmers'
allegations that it illegally manipulated soybean prices with an
emergency order last summer.
   The order led to a 20 percent drop in soybean prices along with
corresponding declines in other commodities, and caused heavy
financial losses among family farmers nationwide, the American
Agriculture Movement says.
   The group, a lobbying organization that represents small farmers
and rural business people in 34 states, and family farmers from
leading soybean-producing states, filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday
against the BOT.
   The lawsuit seeks more than $100 million in damages.
   The complaint stems from the Board of Trade's emergency action
July 11 ordering traders to reduce their holdings in soybean
futures contracts.
   The board's move was widely viewed as an effort to break up an
attempt to corner the market by Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA, an
Italian company and one of the world's largest soybean processors.
   ``The CBOT's order was a bad faith and self-serving action
initiated by the CBOT's dominant grain merchants and futures
traders to create profits for their accounts and for their
clients,'' said Harvey Joe Sanner, AAM's president and an Arkansas
soybean farmer.
   Sanner spoke at a news conference at a downtown hotel,
accompanied by about 25 other farmers from Illinois, Iowa,
Missouri, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, Nebraska, Arkansas, Kansas and
South Dakota _ many of whom said they had been devastated by the
board action.
   ``I'm angry as hell about what has been done to us as producers
of this nation,'' said Corky Jones, a soybean farmer from
Brownville, Neb.
   The BOT, meanwhile, has slapped Ferruzzi's Central Soya unit
with a $1,000-a-day fine for failing to provide documents the
exchange says are needed for an investigation into the Italian
company's actions.
   But a Central Soya spokesman said the company is cooperating
with the investigation and has agreed to provide the documents _
rail contracts between the company and its shippers.
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday names as defendants the exchange, BOT
Chairman Karsten Mahlmann and 21 other directors, along with five
other exchange officials.
   After the news conference, the group _ carrying banners and
buckets of soybeans _ marched five blocks to the Board of Trade.
   BOT spokesman Raymond Carmichael said officials were in
meetings. He agreed to take the soybeans to exchange officials as a
symbol of the complaint.
   In a news release, Mahlmann said exchange officials had not seen
the lawsuit, but are ``confident in the action taken ... by the
board of directors to maintain an orderly liquidation in our July
1989 soybean futures contract.''
   He said board officials ``expect this lawsuit to be proven
frivolous.''

be sent to his friends, Richard and Teri Barnaby.
   ``This is certainly unique,'' said Deputy Secretary of State
Paul Gillies when he heard of the new way of distributing paper
ballots. ``I don't think this has ever happened in Vermont before.
... It's really kind of exciting.''
   The Barnabys had gone to the West Coast on a business trip.
   Facsimile machines allow transmission of printed matter over
telephone lines. But they don't allow the for the sealed envelopes
required for secret ballots, Town Clerk Eva Morse explained.
   Residents were voting for the second time on a $1.05 million
plan to expand the town elementary school. The measure passed
narrowly in September. Opponents gathered enough signatures on a
petition to call for another vote.
   Gillies said Morse called him Monday to ask whether the fax was
a legal way to distribute absentee ballots.
   ``I don't think that the people who drafted the absentee ballot
laws in the 18th century knew about fax machines,'' he said.
   But he said a fax would probably meet the legal definition of a
mailed ballot, and consequently could be allowed.

<HEAD>Crackdown Continues against Sinhalese Extremists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>

   Troops raided a clandestine radio
station and captured its operator in a dragnet that is decimating
the leadership of an extremist group of Sinhalese nationalists,
military officials said today.
   In addition, the bodies of 31 suspected Sinhalese extremists
were discovered at daybreak in the central hills, the officials
said. They blamed the killings on pro-government vigilante groups.
   The government's 2-year-old battle to subdue the People's
Liberation Front took a dramatic turn Monday with the reported
capture and killing of the group's senior leader, Rohana Wijeweera.
   According to a military source, the avowed Marxist ``sang like a
bird'' about the whereabouts of his top lieutenants. In less than
18 hours, Wijeweera and the front's No. 2 and No. 3 men were killed
by security forces, according to government announcements.
   More than 6,000 people have been killed since August 1987 in
violence associated with the People's Liberation Front's
assassination campaign targeting governing officials and supporters.
   The front professed outrage that the Sinhalese-dominated
government made concessions to the Tamil minority, and its battle
escalated into a challenge of the government's right to exist.
   The military officials said the raid on the front's clandestine
radio station was carried out Tuesday night in Boralesgamuwa, six
miles southeast of Colombo.
   The front member in charge of the station, Andreas Costa, was
captured and radio equipment worth $1.3 million seized, according
to the officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   The short-wave radio station was called Voice of the Revolution.
It broadcast three days a week, varying its hours to avoid jamming,
and transmitted Wijeweera's speeches, revolutionary songs and
allegations of government atrocities.
   The front, as well as human rights activists and opposition
politicians, have long accused the government of fielding or
tolerating death squads bent on wiping out the front.
   Some government officials have privately acknowledged that
``excesses'' may have occurred, but they usually blamed the
killings of suspected front members on shadowy vigilante groups.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne claimed Tuesday that six of
the front's seven Politburo members had been killed. But the
military officials said today the Politburo had expanded to nine
members, of whom seven were known to have been killed.
   Although killings blamed on the front have tapered off this
week, it is too soon to say whether the front is finished or simply
regrouping.
   The bodies of the suspected front members were found in two
locations in the center of the island Wednesday.
   Twenty-three badly mutilated bodies were discovered in
Keppitipola, about 65 miles east of Colombo. Eight more bodies were
found in Kandy, 55 miles northeast of Colombo.
   The violence by the Sinhalese extremists erupted after the Sri
Lankan government signed an Indian-sponsored peace accord on July
29, 1987, in an effort to end a Tamil insurrection that started in
1983. The accord spawned a Sinhalese backlash as members of the
ethnic majority accused their government of making too many
concessions to the Tamil minority.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
are mostly Hindus and claim the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese
majority discriminated against them in jobs and education.
   Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population, have
dominated the government and military since Sri Lanka, formerly
called Ceylon, became independent from Britain in 1948.

   The jogger who was gang-raped and badly beaten
in Central Park will spend Thanksgiving at home with her family,
her father said.
   She was released Tuesday from a Connecticut hospital after what
doctors said was a remarkable recovery after being left for dead.
   Her father said he was ``thrilled to have her back,'' and was
preparing a ``quiet Thanksgiving family celebration.''
   In state Supreme Court on Tuesday, the prosecution rested after
four weeks of testimony in a hearing on whether statements six
defendents gave police should be allowed as evidence at their
upcoming rape and attempted murder trials.
   Defense lawyers maintain the statements, in which nearly all the
youths implicate themselves or their co-defendants, were coerced
and therefore illegal.
   A spokesman for Gaylord Hospital in Wallingford, Conn., said the
jogger would continue to be treated there on an outpatient basis.
   ``She continues to have post-traumatic amnesia,'' said spokesman
Gerald Main, ``but she has made good recovery and rehabilitation.''
   Head injuries often lead to post-traumatic amnesia, in which the
victim cannot remember what took place immediately before, during,
and for some time after the injury.
   The jogger, a 29-year-old investment banker, was dragged 200
feet into the underbrush, raped, beaten with a pipe and a rock and
left unconscious April 19. She had been on her nightly run.
   When police found her 3{ hours later, she was in a coma and had
lost almost 80 percent of her blood. She had suffered brain
contusions, two head fractures, broken facial bones and bruises
from head to toe.
   She remained in critical condition at a hospital until May 1,
when she raised her hand and appeared to raise her eyebrows as her
name was called. She was walking a bit when she was moved June 7 to
Gaylord.
   By midsummer, she was reading novels, relearning basic math
skills and calling colleagues at Salomon Bros., where she had
worked before the attack.
   Main said the jogger and her family thanked the public and press
for their support over the past seven months, saying it ``made a
difference in her ability to recover.''
   The family also thanked the news media for respecting her
privacy and anonymity and stressed that the woman's continued
recovery ``is highly dependent'' on these being maintained, Main
said.

<HEAD>Carter: Sandinistas Trying to Smear Foes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter said the Sandinista
government was attemptingm to unfairly tie Nicaragua's civilian
opposition coalition to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   Carter, who will lead an official team monitoring Nicaragua's
Feb. 25 elections, said at a seminar Tuesday at his Presidential
Center that he has complained privately to Sandinista
representatives about a news article in the official Sandinista
newspaper, Barricada.
   The publication attacked Alfredo Cesar, a member of Nicaragua's
National Opposition campaign committee. Carter said the newspaper
``has apparently published a totally fraudulent letter ostensibly
written'' by Cesar.
   Carter said Barricada has tied the opposition coalition ``with
the Contra military activity in a completely illegitimate fashion.''
   Cesar, speaking at the seminar, claimed that President Daniel
Ortega's decision to end a 19-month ceasefire in the war with the
Contras was due to the tight race he faced for reelection against
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the candidate of the National
Opposition Union, a coalition that represents 12 of 21 registered
Nicaraguan parties.
   A new, independent poll of Nicaraguan voters commissioned by a
Miami television station and released Tuesday showed Ortega and
Chamorro in a dead heat. The poll was taken in late October.
   Ortega announced two weeks ago he was canceling the ceasefire,
citing increased attacks by Contras trying to disrupt the elections.
   Cesar, however, cited Nicaraguan government figures showing that
such attacks had decreased in October.
   When the Sandinistas agreed last summer to advance the elections
from November to February, he said, they did not think they would
be seriously challenged.
   ``That equation has changed,'' he said.
   Cesar also accused the Sandinistas of forging documents that
tied the opposition coalition to the Contras. He said the coalition
has condemned violence from all sides.
   Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of Nicaragua's foreign
ministry, said fair and free elections are an issue but so is
sovereignty.
   ``Independence is a prerequisite of democracy. American policy
fails to recognize the link between the democratic process and
self-determination,'' he said.
   ``We are not running these elections to satisfy the United
States,'' he said. He said the United States may ``have to live
with a democratically elected government that is not of its
liking.''
   Carter said he believes the Bush administration will honor the
results and probably lift the 4-year-old trade embargo with
Nicaragua no matter who wins if the independent observer groups
report clean elections.
   Carter said his team will try to monitor voting at about 10
percent of the Nicaraguan polling places and compare the vote
tallied there with the votes turned in to the central counting
point.
   The former president led an official monitoring team at
elections May 7 in Panama. Carter denounced that election as
fraudulent.

   Deeley and his wife, Mary Louise, also 71, had posted signs,
bought classified ads and searched near the airport for Sue Sue.
   One of the signs led Mrs. McCutcheon to the Deeleys.
   Deeley said Sue Sue is his constant companion, but he vowed

   The dollar fell in thin trading in Europe late
this morning. Gold prices rose.
   Currency dealers said the market was waiting for Thursday's
scheduled release of U.S. trade figures.
   ``In Europe, it's quiet again, the movements come only in the
Far East and New York,'' said a dealer at a major West German bank.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.43 yen to a closing 143.37 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 143.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8395 West German marks, down from 1.8540

   Japanese military helicopters rescued all 20
Filipino sailors Wednesday morning after their freighter sank in
rough seas in the East China Sea, but two later died at a hospital,
a local coast guard official said.
   The two dead, deckhands on the 6,034-ton, Panamanian-registered
Tyche, were among eight crew members picked up by a Self Defense
Forces helicopter after they abandoned the flooded vessel 110 miles
northwest of Naha, Okinawa's largest city, said Nagatoshi Naruse of
the Maritime Safety Agency.
   A Maritime Safety Agency helicopter rescued the other 12 crew
members drifting near the accident site earlier in the day, Naruse
said by telephone from Okinawa.
   He quoted an unidentified crew member as saying the ship sank
after it lost timber on board and tilted because of strong winds
and high waves. Winds up to 37 mph were reported in the area at the
time of the accident.
   The Tyche, carrying timber, had been heading for Sakaiminato, a
western Japan port, from a Malaysian port, the official said.

   Eight men dressed as women taunted a city
councilman for his equivocal statements about incest and then
walked out of council chambers to protest his stand against
abortion for victims of rape and incest.
   The men, wearing dresses, floppy hats and heavy makeup, shook
their gloved fingers at councilman Otis Lyons Jr., saying, ``tsk,
tsk, tsk'' as they left council chambers at the first mention of
Lyon's name on Tuesday.
   ``We, Church Ladies for Choice, call upon you to immediately
resign your seat ... publicly apologize to women, especially the
victims of rape and incest, for your crazed and mean-spirited
statements,'' the group said in a letter to Lyons.
   Lyons voted against an Oct. 31 council motion condemning
President Bush's veto of federal abortion funding, saying incest
had ``not been found to be a whole sin'' and quoting passages from
the Bible to support his position.
   He said some of the great men of biblical times engaged in
incest, marrying their sisters.
   ``I don't support incest, but I believe that any form of
abortion is murder,'' Lyons said later.
   Michael Malinchak, one of the demonstrators, said the costumes
were inspired by the ``Church Lady,'' a character from the
``Saturday Night Live'' television comedy show. The demonstrators
were members of local gay and lesbian rights organizations, he said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, concerned by Western powers'
response to the democratic upheaval in Eastern Europe, urged them
not to sour the new spirit of international cooperation by
``exporting capitalism'' to the region.
   He made the comments six days after East Germany's embattled
Communist leaders let their citizens travel freely to the West and
as Western countries appropriate hundreds of million of dollars in
aid for Poland and Hungary.
   Other top Soviet officials joined their president in condemning
any Western attempts to exploit the current instability in the East
bloc and throwing cold water on calls for German reunification.
   In Tokyo, Gorbachev adviser Alexander Yakovlev said he was
surprised by Western commentators who interpret the tumult in the
region as demonstrating the failure of socialism and Soviet policy.
   ``This is an obsolete, archaic way of thinking,'' the Politburo
member told a news conference today. ``We would like to have a
common European house based on freedom. If someone interferes in
that process, we might go back to the time of the Cold War. We are
standing at such a juncture.''
   Gorbachev issued his warning to the West in a Kremlin meeting
Tuesday with Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France.
   ``It is useless to clamor about victory in the Cold War, about
the disintegration of some or other social system,'' Tass
paraphrased Gorbachev as saying. ``Everything should be analyzed
realistically and interests should be balanced.''
   He then urged Western leaders not to practice their own form of
socio-economic imperialism.
   ``When accusations of `exporting revolutions' are replaced with
calls for `exporting capitalism,' we have at hand a dangerous
manifestation of old thinking,'' Tass paraphrased Gorbachev as
saying.
   Gorbachev made the comments as West Germany's economics
minister, Helmut Haussmann, offered to rebuild East Germany's
economy through broad-based investments and joint ventures and to
overhaul the country's moribund communications and transport
systems.
   While not offering details, Haussmann said such aid would occur
only if East Germany carried out a ``thorough change'' of its
centrally planned economy.
   In a June 15 news conference in Bonn, West Germany, Gorbachev
declared the Cold War over but did not take credit for ending it,
as he now apparently is accusing the West of doing.
   The Kremlin has called for negotiating an end to the Warsaw Pact
and NATO as military alliances, turning them into purely political
groups that cooperate more closely. Gorbachev also has called for
cooperation between the European Economic Community and COMECON,
the East bloc's economic alliance.
   On Tuesday, Gorbachev indicated these groups should not be
scrapped but rather transformed into bodies that foster stability.
   ``It is no time to destroy the established international
political and economic institutions. Let them transform themselves
with taking into account internal processes, let them find
themselves a niche in the new situation and interact,'' Tass quoted
him as saying.
   Gorbachev praised the changes that have taken place in
individual Eastern European countries without identifying them.
   In the past several months, dizzying changes have swept through
the East bloc.
   East Germany's ruling Communists ousted their longtime leader,
Erich Honecker, last month and on Thursday opened their borders in
an effort to win credibility with a people demanding free elections
and an end to the Communist monopoly on power.
   Czechoslovakia on Tuesday granted its citizens free travel
abroad.
   On Friday, Bulgaria replaced its longtime Communist leader,
Todor Zhivkov.
   In August, Poland became the first East bloc nation with a
government not led by Communists.
   Last month, Hungary's Communists changed the name of their party
to the Hungarian Socialist Party and endorsed a transition to
parliamentary democracy, promising free elections by June.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and his French
counterpart clashed Tuesday over whether reunification of East and
West Germany is desireable.
   According to Tass, Shevardnadze expressed ``great concern'' with
West German officials pushing for reunification.
   He said such talk encroaches on East Germany's sovereignty. In a
separate speech, the Soviet envoy added that other countries should
not ``profit by the complications, tie on various kinds of advice
or conditions.''
   In his speech, however, Dumas said France and West Germany want
``European unity'' and he called for resolving the ``German
question,'' Tass reported. Dumas said this should not be seen as a
threat, risk or danger by other countries.
   The Soviet Union has about 380,000 troops in East Germany, which
has since the end of World War II been the linchpin in their
European defense corridor.

<TEXT>
   A study at the University of Pennsylvania
indicates stress can worsen skin diseases, giving credence to a
theory long held by doctors, according to a researcher.
   The study, scheduled for publication today in the journal
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows nerve fibers
in the skin release a protein that triggers inflammation, such as
in psoriasis or acne.
   ``There is now some evidence to show that, at least in the skin,
the immune response is controlled to some extent by state of mind
and emotional status,'' said Dr. George Murphy, the study's lead
author.
   ``For dermatologists, this is remarkably significant because of
the observation that has been held for hundreds of years that
anxiety and stress can provoke itching or cause worsening of skin
diseases.''
   Other scientists cautioned that other dermatological research
showed different factors also could trigger the response. They
called Murphy's claims of a stress-immunity link premature.
   The Penn researchers, in studing a series of live skin samples,
found that the protein, called substance P, is released by tiny
nerve fibers in the skin that lie near mast cells.
   As substance P bathes the mast cells, it causes them to release
granules, which secrete a substance that leaks into blood vessels,
according to the study.
   The walls of the blood vessel become sticky and white blood
cells begin to accummulate, inflamming the skin, the Penn study
said.
   Previously, researchers believed the loss of granules from the
mast cells occurred after inflammation, which current treatments
try to suppress.
   Dr. Bruce Wintroub of the University of California in San
Francisco called the mast cell conclusion a ``reasonable
hypothesis.''
   But he hesitated to agree that Murphy's research proves a
stress-immunity link.
   Dr. Alan Lorincz of the University of Chicago said a variety of
substances can stimulate the loss of granules from mast cells.
Earlier research showed that even when the release of substance P
is blocked, some signs of inflammation occur, Lorincz said.
   ``I have no doubt that substance P is involved (in
inflammation), but whether it's a universal key, I would say no,''
Lorencz said.
   The Penn researchers, while using skin as a model, said the
study's results could lead to new forms of treatment for
inflammation in other organs, such as the lungs.

   William Thomas Harris, who started as a
clerk and built a grocery store chain, died Tuesday at age 81 after
giving a speech demanding that a Baptist convention change the name
of a local college.
   Harris had called for Wingate College to be changed to
Cannon-Wingate University to honor Charles Cannon, a textile
magnate who has given millions to the school. Harris had been
embroiled in a year-long dispute with state Baptists over the name
change.
   His motion was defeated after Harris collapsed and was taken
away.
   Harris grew up on a farm in his native Cordele, Ga., quitting
school in the 10th grade and working his way up to become an A&amp;P
grocery store manager before starting his own Charlotte store in
1936.
   His Harris-Teeter Supermarket chain, which has 128 stores in
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, did more
than $1 billion in sales last year.

   Of the millions of East Germans who
rushed to the West when travel barriers were lifted, one man really
hit the jackpot.
   The 40-year-old mechanic, identified only as Guenther, arrived
Friday just in time to buy a ticket for the Lower Saxony state
lottery, the Bild newspaper said. On Saturday night, he learned he
won 1.2 million marks ($650,000).
   ``I saw the numbers drawn on television and knew I had all
six,'' Bild quoted Guenther as saying. Lottery drawings are
broadcast regularly on Saturday evening television in West Germany.
   Guenther contacted the state lottery office on Monday by
telephone and asked what he had won, Bild said.
   ``You have won 1.2 million marks,'' he was told.
   ``What can I buy with it?'' he asked.
   ``A Mercedes, a house, and the rest I can put in the bank for
you and you'll draw 5,000 marks ($2,700) a month in interest after
taxes,'' Bild quoted the lottery official as responding.
   The lucky East German has since returned to his home in Herzberg
where he said he intends to continue to live and work, while making
regular weekend visits to West Germany, Bild said.
   Identities and addresses of lottery winners in West Germany are
not normally made public in order to protect their privacy.

<HEAD>Dukakis Puts Final Nail in `Massachusetts Miracle' Coffin</HEAD>

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis conceded for the
first time that the Massachusetts Miracle that nearly carried him
to the White House is no more.
   But the former Democratic candidate for president said Tuesday
that the formula that produced a white-hot economy in the early
1980s can bring Massachusetts back from the brink of recession.
   ``The miracle of the '80s may be over, but the fundamental
strengths that made it happen are still here _ daring entrepreneurs
and productive workers, great universities and great hospitals,''
the governor said.
   ``I don't plan to spend the next 14 months ... debating whether
or not we're in a recession. I plan to spend that time laying the
foundation we will need to make the 1990s every bit as good or
better than the '80s.''
   Declining revenue has left the state with a $720 million budget
deficit and budget cuts are threatening already strapped social,
construction and educational programs.
   Dukakis' comments came in an address at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in which he outlined his blueprint for
economic success in the 1990s. Dukakis has said he will leave
office when his term is up after 1990.
   The governor called for revitalized state construction,
expansion in manufacturing and the troubled high-tech industry and
aggressive recruitment of international investment to capitalize on
the European Community's economic merger in 1992.
   ``Massachusetts must go international with a vengeance,'' he
said.
   Dukakis was chatty and joking at the outset of his speech, the
first time he was visibly at ease in public since his wife, Kitty,
was hospitalized last week after drinking rubbing alcohol.
   ``I believe in the economic future of this commonwealth because
I believe in the time-tested qualities of the people of this state
_ their creativity and innovation and determination,'' he said.

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil today made a final stride
toward full civilian rule as voters cast ballots in the country's
first popular presidential election in nearly three decades.
   The vote, on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the
Brazilian Republic, follows two decades of rapid economic
development in spite of massive foreign debt and widespread poverty.
   The favorite is a conservative former state governor, Fernando
Collor de Mello of the National Reconstruction Party, but he is not
expected to win enough votes to avoid a runoff with one of two top
two leftist candidates.
   Early reports indicated voting was peaceful across the country.
   In Rio de Janeiro, voters waited good-humoredly in huge lines
that snaked around city blocks, despite a threat of rain. Many
voted early to take advantage of the national holiday, which marks
the 100th anniversary of the founding of a republic that overthrew
Emperor Pedro II.
   Brazilians lined up to vote hours before the polls opened at 8
a.m. (5 a.m. EST). Polls were to close at 5 p.m., with partial
results expected at around 9 p.m. An official projection of the
winner was due Saturday.
   Collor de Mello's attacks on President Jose Sarney for 1,300
percent annual inflation and widespread corruption have struck a
chord with many of the 82 million registered voters, most of whom
earn less than $36 a week.
   In a national TV address Tuesday night, Sarney called the
election ``an extraordinary spectacle'' that demonstrated ``the
flourishing of Brazilian democracy.''
   ``The democratic transition is complete,'' said Sarney, who was
chosen in 1985 by an electoral college after the military ended 21
years of rule. ``God has won in Brazil.''
   Fighting for second place are two leftists _ ex-governor Leonel
Brizola, who pledges West European-style socialism, and Rep. Luis
Inacia Lula da Silva, a former factory worker and strike leader who
wants a ``workers' republic,'' with nationalized banks and
cancellation of Brazil's $110 billion foreign debt.
   If no candidate wins a majority _ and it's doubtful anyone will
_ the top two vote-getters will meet in a runoff Dec. 17.
   Collor de Mello had a comfortable lead, but far short of a
majority in the 21-candidate field, according to two opinion polls
announced Tuesday.
   Many voters wore red bandanas, the symbol of Brizola, who was
about even with da Silva in voter surveys. But in Brasilia, the
capital, election officials made Brizola sympathizers take off the
bandanas to vote.
   Other than Brizola or Lula, only two other candidates were given
any chance of squeaking into the No. 2 spot: center-leftist Sen.
Mario Covas, and rightist Rep. Paulo Maluf.
   The two-month campaign has been marred by some personal insults,
but enthusiastic crowds have gathered at street rallies across this
nation of 150 million people, South America's largest. Silvio
Santos, a television personality, tried to enter the race at the
last minute, but officials ruled he had violated election rules.
   Paper ballots with squares beside each candidate's name were
waiting at 250,000 polling stations, from the southern plains to
the remote jungle villages in the northwestern Amazon region.
   Special stations were set up for the blind and for the estimated
half-million people with leprosy. In some places, voting equipment
had to be carried in by canoe or on mules.
   Federal troops were stationed in 39 of Brazil's 4,445 counties _
mostly in the remote north and northwest _ to keep order and to
prevent last-minute campaigning.
   Brazilians under 47 _ nearly 73 percent of the electorate _ have
never voted for president.
   In the last election in 1960, Janio Quadros won, but he stunned
the nation by saying he was plagued by ``occult forces'' and
resigned after seven months in office. His vice president, Joao
Goulart, took over but was ousted in a military coup in 1964.
   The military regime banned direct voting for president but it
was restored by a new constitution enacted last year. Voting is
mandatory for everyone between age 18 and 69.
   And for the first time in the country's history, 16- and
17-year-olds may vote, though it's not mandatory. Some 3.3 million
_ more than half of those eligible _ have registered.
   The election comes a century after republicans in Brazil
overthrew Latin America's only independent monarchy.

   A proposed ban on rush-hour truck traffic on
all Los Angeles streets won unanimous initial approval from the
City Council.
   The council Tuesday directed the city attorney to draft the
needed ordinances following an 11-0 vote. The ordinances require
final council approval.
   Mayor Tom Bradley proposed the ban, saying trucks are the
biggest contributor to rush-hour gridlock. The ban, fiercely
opposed by the trucking industry, would reduce rush-hour truck
traffic on city streets by 70 percent.
   Exempted would be grocery delivery trucks, trucks carrying cargo
from the harbor and trucks making deliveries of seasonal produce _
with Christmas trees and watermelons specifically mentioned.
   Trucks delivering liquor would not be affected because they are
regulated by the state.

<HEAD>Report: State of Emergency in South Africa May Be Lifted in February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government may lift the
state of emergency and free jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela to coincide with the opening of Parliament on Feb.
2, a newspaper said today.
   Business Day said Cabinet members ``are prepared to concede in
private'' that the two steps are essential if President F.W. de
Klerk is to succeed with his proposals to negotiate some form of
black-white power-sharing.
   The newspaper, which generally reflects the views of liberal
business leaders, said senior government officials ``have accepted
the state of emergency is an obstacle to getting negotiations
started and are pressing for it to be lifted.''
   Mandela, whom many blacks regard as their paramount leader, has
been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for planning
an anti-government sabotage campaign on behalf of the outlawed ANC.
   The state of emergency was declared in June 1986. Emergency
regulations allow police to detain people indefinitely without
trial, outlaw certain forms of protest, and subject the news media
to various restrictions.
   Last month, the government unconditionally freed seven African
National Congress leaders, five of them co-defendants of Mandela.
Their freedom to speak out, even at mass rallies, was been widely
viewed as a move by the government to begin dismantling the
emergency.
   In a related development, the official magazine of the Dutch
Reformed Church _ to which most government officials belong _
called on de Klerk to consider reprieving political prisoners on
Death Row.
   Several ANC guerrillas convicted on terrorism charges are among
the more than 200 prisoners currently facing execution.
   Mandela's release has been demanded by a wide range of black
leaders as a precondition for accepting the government's invitation
to negotiate a new political system.
   Last weekend, however, one of the most powerful moderate black
groups, the Zulu political organization Inkatha, announced that it
was prepared to open talks with the government immediately.
Inkatha's leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in the past had been among
those demanding Mandela's release, but he has expressed annoyance
at the freed ANC leaders for remarks which he perceives as
suggesting the ANC is the sole legitimate voice of South Africa's
blacks.
   De Klerk, who took office in August, has offered to negotiate a
new constitution within five years that extends some form of
political rights to the black majority while providing whites with
some form of veto power.
   Inkatha, in a concession likely to anger the ANC, said it was
willing to negotiate a new system that stopped short of one-person,
one-vote.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Rise, Sales Drop in September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories rose 0.2 percent in
September, while business sales dropped 0.3 percent, the government
reported today.
   The combination of the accumulation of goods on shelves and
backlots rising faster than sales could be bad news for the
economy. If inventories were to pile up excessively, it could mean
cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs.
   The Commerce Department said inventories climbed to a seasonally
adjusted $791.8 billion in September, following a gain of 0.4
percent in August.
   Business sales, meanwhile, dropped to a seasonally adjusted
$524.6 billion after advancing 3 percent in August.
   The September business activity produced an increase in the
ratio of sales to 1.51, meaning it would take 1.51 months to
exhaust inventories at the September pace. The ratio was 1.50 in
August.
   Retailer backlogs were up 1 percent in September and could be
worse in October. The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that
retail sales last month dropped a full 1 percent that included a
5.1 percent decline in car sales.
   On the other hand, manufacturers inventories, which represent
about 45 percent of the total, slipped 0.1 percent and wholesale
backlogs dropped 0.3 percent.
   Manufacturers' sales, on the other hand, fell 1.6 percent in
September. Retailers' and wholesalers' sales both were up 0.7
percent.
   Overall inventories were 6.4 percent above those of a year ago.
Sales increased 6.7 percent over September 1988.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers ordered at least
350,000 Palestinians not to leave their homes in the occupied lands
today, the first anniversary of the PLO's declaration of a
Palestinian state.
   But festivities were held in several towns and refugee camps in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in which youths shot off fireworks,
danced in the streets and carried balloons painted with the colors
of the Palestinian national flag.
   Violent protests occurred in at least five towns where soldiers
fired live ammunition and rubber bullets, injuring 10 people during
stone-throwing demonstrations, Arab reports said. Police said they
arrested seven stone-throwers in East Jerusalem.
   Police also fired tear gas to disperse a protest march by 200
doctors and nurses from two hospitals in East Jerusalem after rocks
were hurled at the troops from behind fences, a spokesman said. No
injuries were reported.
   Troops were under orders to respond firmly to any violence and
were warned that uprising activists had received orders to increase
the use of firearms following the fatal shooting Monday of a
soldier in the Gaza Strip.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told legislators Tuesday that
Arab activists had received secret orders from uprising leaders to
attack Israelis with firearms, rather than stones or firebombs,
newspapers reported.
   The day marks one year since the Palestine Liberation
Organization's parliament-in-exile proclaimed statehood in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which have been under Israeli military
occupation since the 1967 Middle East War.
   About 1.7 million Palestinians and 70,000 Israeli settlers live
in the occupied territories. The Israeli government has ignored the
PLO declaration and refused negotiations with the organization,
which it calls terrorist.
   Since the uprising against Israeli occupation began 23 months
ago, 615 Palestinians and 41 Israelis have been killed.
   Palestinians launched celebrations of the holiday Tuesday night,
setting off fireworks in some towns, where women also danced in
streets.
   In Tilat Al-Haritiya village near Ramallah, children gathered on
the streets Tuesday night singing nationalist songs and draping
displaying photographs of PLO chief Yasser Arafat across
electricity poles.
   The army today curtailed festivities by imposing curfews in more
than 20 towns, villages, refugee camps and cities throughout the
disputed lands.
   At least 350,000 Palestinians were affected.
   Soldiers also blocked transport in the Gaza Strip for a second
straight day. Two Palestinians were shot and wounded during
stone-throwing protests in Nozeirat refugee camp in Gaza, Arab
reports said.
   Also today, a U.N. peacekeeper in south Lebanon shot and killed
an Israeli-allied militiaman and wounded another who tried to force
their car through a roadblock and clashed with U.N. troops,
officials said.
   The incident occurred near the village of Ibil As-Saqy, five
miles north of the Israeli border, inside Israel's self-proclaimed
6-to10-mile security zone in south Lebanon, Timor Goksel, a
spokesman for the peacekeepers said.

   Kitty Dukakis, hospitalized last week after
drinking rubbing alcohol, was undergoing treatment today at a
hospital unit specializing in depression and related disorders.
   The 52-year-old wife of Gov. Michael Dukakis was transferred
Tuesday from Brigham and Women's Hospital to New England Deaconess'
affective disorders unit, the governor's office said. She was in
satisfactory condition today.
   A recovering alcoholic with a history of depression, Mrs.
Dukakis was admitted to Brigham and Women's on Nov. 6.
   Deaconess' 27-bed affective disorders unit treats patients
suffering from mood disorders, such as depression and mood swings.
   Dukakis press secretary Mindy Lubber said Deaconess was chosen
by the Dukakis family and their doctors because ``it was a program
they were very comfortable with.'' She said it isn't known long how
long Mrs. Dukakis will remain there.
   On Monday, the governor said his wife had ``a slip,'' or a
relapse back into drinking, when she swallowed the rubbing alcohol.
Her doctor has said she also suffers from depression, which is
known as an affective disorder.
   She had earlier admitted to being addicted to diet pills, for
which she has also received treatment.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, jumping the gun on anniversary
report cards, is already declaring ``a successful first year''
after just 10 months in office. But his assessment of his own
performance misses a few mileposts.
   For instance, when Bush travels to Rhode Island on Monday to
appear at two Republican fund-raisers, it will be the 30th state he
has visited since his inauguration in January.
   And when Bush goes to Malta for his Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit
with Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, it will be the 14th
foreign nation he will have visited as president.
   Bush has vetoed five bills _ and has not yet been overridden by
Congress.
   By the same token, Bush has received few legislative victories.
Of the nearly two dozen major proposals he has sent to Capitol
Hill, only one _ legislation to rescue the ailing savings and loan
industry _ has been enacted.
   Some 119 of his nominations remain in limbo in Congress. And he
was the first president in recent times to have a Cabinet nominee _
John Tower as defense secretary _ rejected by the full Senate.
   The president has given what the White House considers 27
``formal news conferences.''
   White House pet spaniel Millie, in her first 10 months as first
pup, has killed six squirrels, two rats and one pigeon on the White
House grounds, Bush recently confided to several reporters during
one of his frequent jogs.
   Bush took 15 days in August to catch one fish.
   The president has spent only six weekends at the White House
since taking office. And, while he has made six trips this year to
his family compound at Kennebunkport, Maine, he spends most
weekends at the presidential retreat at Camp David.
   He spends so much time at the retreat in the Catoctin Mountains
in Maryland, in fact, that he told a recent audience ``my son
Marvin has started a modest lobbying campaign for me to change the
name to Camp Marvin.''
   He observed that former President Eisenhower named the retreat
after his grandson, David. But, Bush added, since he himself had
four sons, one daughter and 11 grandchildren, picking a new name
might touch off a fierce inter-family competition.
   In off-year general and special election races, he made campaign
appearances for six Republican candidates. His batting average _
two won, four lost.
   He claims he gets up to 60,000 letters a week ``from children to
our oldest citizens.''
   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank recently suggested that Bush
_ who himself dashes off thank-you notes and letters throughout
each day _ has generated and received more correspondence than any
president in U.S. history at an equivalent point in his term.
   In 10 months in office, in fact, Bush has been responsible for
more correspondence than some presidents generated in their entire
administrations, Frank said.
   Meanwhile, Bush frequently breaks his own self-imposed rule
about answering reporters' questions at picture-taking sessions.
   In fact, he violated it twice on Tuesday _ answering questions
on the easing of travel restrictions in Czechoslovakia in the
morning and on Nicaraguan arms shipments to El Salvador in the
afternoon.
   Bush also continues to stick to his own versions of some places'
and people's names _ often talking about the Middle East nation of
``The Lebanon'' and referring to Polish Solidarity Leader Lech
Walesa's first name as ``Lock.''
   Asked on Tuesday why Bush always called Walesa, his dinner guest
at the White House Tuesday night, ``Lock,'' spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said that when Bush went to Poland as vice president in
1987, ``someone in Poland told him that the correct pronunciation
... was `lock.' And he has used it ever since.''
   Of course, Fitzwater has some trouble with last names himself.
The other day, he turned red-faced after beginning a briefing by
referring to the nation's 41st chief executive as ``President
Mush.''

<TEXT>
   The trial of a Hispanic policeman in the slaying of
a black motorcyclist opened today with the prosecution arguing that
the officer was in no danger and did not have to fire the shot that
set off three days of riots.
   Circuit Judge Joseph Farina cleared the way Tuesday for the
manslaughter trial of Miami officer William Lozano by refusing to
move the case out of Miami. He rejected defense arguments that the
threat of violence hung over the trial and could frighten jurors
into convicting Lozano to avoid another riot.
   Assistant State Attorney Don Horn told the racially mixed jury,
seated after three weeks of questioning, that the 31-year-old
officer failed to act as a prudent policeman should have in the
slaying of Clement Lloyd, 23.
   ``It was not a life-or-death situation. It was not a
split-second decision, and he did not have to shoot,'' said Horn.
   He said Lozano shot Lloyd in the head after taking two steps
into the street and putting himself closer to the path of Lloyd's
speeding motorcycle, which was being chased by a patrol car.
   Defense attorney Roy Black, in his opening arguments, said the
shooting ``had nothing to do with race.''
   ``Officer Lozano did not shoot his gun because he's a Hispanic.
Clement Lloyd was not shot because he is black,'' Black said. But
within moments, he said, ``race had everything to do with this
case'' as a crowd formed in a prelude to a night of rioting.
   The Jan. 16 shooting, which also led to the death of Lloyd's
passenger, exploded into three days of rioting. One looter was shot
to death, 11 people were wounded by gunfire and 13 buildings were
burned down.
   Some black leaders said the jury's ethnic mixture _ two blacks,
one Hispanic and three non-Hispanic whites _ could head off a
repeat of rioting that followed acquittals by all-white juries in
1980 and 1984 of two other officers who had killed blacks.
   ``The fact that the jury resembles the tri-ethnic balance of
this community goes a long way to reducing that level of tension,''
said William Sims of Dade County's Community Relations Board.
   A televised forum Tuesday night in the predominantly black
Overtown neighborhood where the shooting occurred illustrated the
community's continuing anger, as many participants complained that
they were mistreated by Hispanics who arrived in this country only
recently.
   The anger led the defense to enter into the record scores of
items showing that more violence was expected if Lozano was
acquitted.
   The exhibits included violence-threatening posters by the
``Overtown Comrades,'' and documents showing police contingency
plans to combat a riot if Lozano is found innocent.
   Decisions by the judge have sharply limited how much the defense
can reveal to jurors about the slain motorcyclist's police record
and allegations that he was picking up drug profits the night of
the killing.
   ``We have to start out with the the court already excluding 75
percent of our defense,'' Black said Tuesday. ``Needless to say,
we're operating under a great handicap.''
   The shooting took place during the week of the Super Bowl in
Miami. The Colombian-born Lozano and his partner were on an
Overtown street, talking to the victim of a minor crime.
   As they talked, another squad car was chasing down a speeding
motorcycle driven by Lloyd and carrying his friend Allan Blanchard,
24.
   When the motorcycle turned onto the street where Lozano was
standing, the officer fired one shot, killing Lloyd instantly and
sending the motorcycle crashing into a car.
   Blanchard died later. Lozano was charged with two counts of
manslaughter.
   If convicted on both counts, he would face a maximum penalty of
60 years imprisonment.
   Within an hour after the shooting, a mob gathered at the scene
and began pelting officers with rocks and bottles, starting the
rioting.
   Lloyd was found to have high levels of alcohol and THC _ the
active chemical in marijuana _ in his blood at the time of his
death.
   He also had 5.5 grams of marijuana and $1,500 in his pocket,
facts the defense contends showed he was a drug dealer desperate
enough to run down a policeman to avoid arrest.
   The city later set up a commission to examine the roots of the
racial disturbance, the fourth to hit Miami in the 1980s.
   The first occurred in 1980 after an all-white jury in Tampa
acquitted a group of Metro-Dade policemen in the fatal beating of
black insurance executive Arthur McDuffie. The case was moved to
Tampa because of pretrial publicity.
   In 1982, a riot broke out when Miami policeman Luis Alvarez
entered an Overtown video arcade and shot and killed Nevell
Johnson, a black. Two years later, violence broke out again when an
all-white jury acquitted Alvarez of manslaughter.

   A government panel has proposed
revising laws on assembly and association to comply with
international human rights accords without discarding traditional
Communist principles, an official said today.
   The state-run Human Rights Committee submitted the three draft
laws to Premier Ladislav Adamec, who on Tuesday announced that
Czechoslovaks wishing to travel to the West will no longer need
exit visas, beginning Jan. 1.
   Despite some easing of restrictions, however, the hard-line
government continued to crack down on dissent. A court in
Bratislava on Tuesday sentenced an activist who urged his
countrymen to honor those killed in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion
that crushed reforms in Czechoslovakia.
   Zbynek Vokrouhlicky, a member of the Human Rights Committee that
worked out the draft laws, told The Associated Press they will go
to a legislative commission before being considered by Parliament,
probably in the spring.
   The Communist Party organ Rude Pravo on Tuesday said the
committee submitted the drafts to Adamec on Nov. 1O. Copies of the
drafts could not be obtained immediately, and there were few
details on their contents.
   Czechoslovakia is rewriting its laws to conform with human
rights commitments signed at a 35-nation conference in Vienna early
this year.
   Those accords commit the signatory nations to allow freer travel
and guarantee human rights. It was not immediately clear if the
laws under discussion will translate into more freedoms for the
country's population.
   Adamec said the easing of travel, which has been introduced
gradually over the past two years, was designed to reduce
bureaucracy and contribute to the ``satisfaction of its citizens.''
   Czechoslovaks have been allowed to travel more freely than their
counterparts in other hard-line Communist countries, and Western
analysts said the new rules will not have a marked effect on who
will be allowed to travel.
   People wishing to travel west still must apply for visas from
the country of destination and must prove they have sufficent hard
currency to cover travel expenses.
   Analysts, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was no
indication that political activists, many of whom have had their
passports confiscated, would be allowed to travel under the new
regulations.
   In Bratislava, a court sentenced activist Miroslav Kusy to an
eight-month suspended sentence after a two-day trial and acquitted
three others who signed a statement urged Slovaks to mark the 21st
anniversary of the 1968 invasion.
   The court refused the defendants' request to be tried together
with a fifth activist, Jan Carnogursky, whose case goes to trial
separately next week. He could face up to 10 years in jail.

   The telephone company in metropolitan New
York is free to pull the plug on live dial-a-porn services after
today, a federal judge ruled in a free-speech case.
   U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn on Tuesday refused to block New
York Telephone Co. from barring two-way conversations on its 970
exchange.
   The exchange, available only in four area codes around New York
City, allows callers to participate in sexually explicit
conversations as well as hear taped messages.
   Companies that operate such services set fees of $3 per minute
or more that New York Telephone is responsible for collecting. The
phone company was taken to court by dial-a-porn providers when it
refused to continue billing.
   The services won a temporary order from a state court in
September that allowed the services to continue, and then brought
the matter to federal court as a fight over freedom of speech.
   McCurn ruled that the services had not proved the case was a
First Amendment issue, but he also refused to throw out the case,
leaving open the possibility the vendors can seek court relief on
other grounds.
   Two-way dial-a-porn services provided by five companies will
cease at the end of the business day today, said their lawyer, Joel
Dichter. But he said he would file a motion as soon as possible to
allow the services to resume.
   New York Telephone attorney Kevin Walsh said the case was never
a fight over freedom of speech. He said the phone company has no
power to regulate the content of taped messages or live
conversations.
   ``No one is prohibiting them from speaking. If people want to
spend 50 minutes on the phone with Stella or 30 minutes with
Raquel, they have the right and the companies have the right to
provide that service,'' said Walsh.
   ``But we're not going to do the billing and collecting. With
this kind of thing, it's easy to see people getting carried away
and then not wanting to pay the bill when it comes due.''

<HEAD>Thousands of Judges and Court Workers End Strike in Colombia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 5,000 judges and 12,000 court
workers ended a two-week strike today after the government agreed
to give them bulletproof vests, bodyguards and reinforced cars to
protect them from drug traffickers.
   The strike, which shut down Colombia's judicial system, ended as
a result of a meeting Tuesday with the minister of justice, said
Consuleo Herrera, a board member of the National Association of
Court Workers.
   Justice Minister Roberto Salazar also promised that judges'
offices will be moved to government buildings offering better
security, Mrs. Herrera told The Associated Press. The government
also will study the possibility of salary increases for judges
dealing with drug trafficking cases, Mrs. Herrera said. Judges are
paid an average of about $400 a month.
   The government will start providing the bulletproof vests,
bodyguards and bullet-resistant cars next week, she said.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy said today the U.S. government had
donated 300 bulletproof vests, 12 bullet-resistant cars, 12 metal
detectors and $500,000 for buying other security equipment.
   Britain sent a Hercules cargo plane loaded with weapons,
munitions and security equipment for the judges, the Colombian
radio network Caracol said. A spokeswoman for the British Embassy
in Bogota, Mery de Castello, said she was unable to confirm or deny
the report.
   The strike was declared after a federal judge was shot and
killed in the drug trafficking center of Medellin. The judge was
the third killed in three months. Although no one claimed
responsbility for the killings, government security forces and the
judges' union blamed drug traffickers.
   The government declared war on the traffickers after they killed
a popular presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan, on Aug. 18.
The traffickers then began a wave of bombings and assassinations
and threatened reprisals for any traffickers extradited to the
United States. There have been 253 attacks attrributed to drug
traffickers, with 39 people killed.

<TEXT>
   A quarrel between two brothers touched
off street battles between rival Shiite Moslem militiamen loyal to
Syria and Iran, killing one combatant and wounding three, police
said today.
   In a separate development, the Christian army commander, Gen.
Michel Aoun, threatened to cut the throats and tongues of moderate
Christian leaders who support an Arab-brokered peace plan to end
Lebanon's civil war.
   His threat appeared aimed at blocking moderates in the Christian
heartland he controls from joining a national reconciliation
Cabinet under premier-designate Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem.
   Police said the brothers' quarrel began after Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah, a senior leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, went to visit his ailing mother at the sprawling
Shiyah district at nightfall Tuesday.
   He was stopped by gunmen guarding the house under his younger
brother, who goes by the nom de guerre of Abul-Rou'b, or father of
horror, and commands Shiite fighters of the pro-Syrian Amal
militia, according to police.
   Nasrallah's bodyguards fired in the air to clear way for the
sheik. His brother shouted orders to his men from the mother's
bedside to shoot back and ``all hell broke loose,'' said a police
spokemsan.
   Fighting quickly engulfed the entire Shiyah district and then
spread to Bir el-Abed and Hay Madi neighborhoods as Sheik
Nasrallah's motorcade raced back under gunfire to
Hezbollah-controlled territory, said the spokesman.
   He said the command of a Syrian army contingent in charge of
security of Beirut's Moslem sector intervened with the leaders of
Amal and Hezbollah to curb the flare-up.
   It tapered off briefly but picked up again at midnight, when
militiamen of the two factions shot at each other with machine
guns, 106mm jeep-mounted recoiless guns and rocket-propelled
grenades until dawn, the spokesman said.
   He said Syrian troops patrolled Shiyah and other Shiite slums
this morning to prevent a new outbreak of violence.
   Hezbollah and secular Amal have long been fighting for dominance
of the 1.2 million Shiites, who make up the largest single sect
among Lebanon's 4 million population.
   Aoun's threat was reported in a statement released by his press
office in the shell-battered presidential palace in suburban
Baabda, five miles east of Beirut.
   ``Those who support the Arab solution deserve to have their
throats and tongues cut,'' the 54-year-old Maronite general said.
``We are not going to be lenient with them.''
   Aoun appeared to be responding to a statement by Maronite
Parliament member Butros Harb, who publicly ridiculed the ``war of
liberation'' Aoun declared in March to drive Syria's 40,000 troops
from Lebanon.
   Harb represents the independent Maronite bloc, which has 14
deputies in the Lebanese Parliament that approved the Arab League
peace plan forged at a special session in Taif, Saudi Arabia, which
shifts power to the Moslem majority. Aoun, who heads an interim
military Cabinet, rejected the accord, demanding a timetable for a
total Syrian withdrawal

   A judge today permanently barred the release of a
Ringo Starr album that the former Beatle considers an embarassment
recorded while he was on drugs and alcohol.
   The action by Superior Court Judge Clarence Cooper was revealed
as the trial began on two remaining issues _ a dispute over whether
Starr owes Memphis, Tenn., producer Chips Moman $146,239 in
expenses for making the 1987 record, and whether Moman has the
rights to future recordings by Starr.
   Cooper gave no reason for making permanent another judge's
temporary order keeping the record under wraps.
   The suit against Moman and College Park-based CRS Records
contends that the results of the 1987 recording sessions are
substandard and would be a professional embarrassment to Starr, who
concedes he was then addicted to alcohol.
   Starr, the first witness to testify today, said he went to
Memphis in February 1987 to work with Moman on an album, thinking
that there was no formal contract between them.
   ``We felt some agreement would be reached but it always hinged
on if the album was a hit,'' Starr testified. The drummer and
singer said he paid his own expenses and believed Moman was not
charging for studio time.
   Moman's attorney, Thomas Washburn III, told Cooper in opening
arguments that Moman would never have agreed to work with Starr
without a contractual agreement.
   ``If there is anyone in this room who knows what they're doing
regarding the music industry, it's Chips Moman,'' Washburn said.
   Starr's appearance in Atlanta drew a stream of courthouse
employees seeking a glimpse of the former Beatle.
   He drew laughs when he took the stand and jokingly said into the
microphone, ``Is it on? Or are we rolling, Bob?''
   Starr has claimed that he and other musicians at the recording
dates were often drunk and sometimes high on marijuana. Starr
recently underwent treatment for his addiction and embarked on a
well-received U.S. concert tour during the summer.
   Moman's lawyers have argued that the recordings in question are
of good quality, and they cited the producer's reputation,
including work with Elvis Presley. Moman has testified that he did
not allow liquor in his studio.
   Washburn said his client rejected an offer of $100,000 from
Starr to kill the album; he said in August that the album could
make $3.5 million.

<HEAD>Hispanic Grand Jurors Quit to Protest Lack of Indictment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLORADO CITY, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Hispanics quit a grand jury to
protest what they said was a ``railroad job'' by prosecutors to
help a former policeman avoid trial in the shooting death of a
Mexican-American rape suspect.
   District Attorney Frank Conard said Tuesday he expects the grand
jurors to return when their session resumes Friday. ``They took an
oath to do a duty,'' he said.
   The grand jury was the second in this town of 5,500 to refuse to
indict the former part-time policeman, Billy Ray Williamson, in the
1988 slaying of Sammy Gomez.
   A grand jury cleared Williamson a week after the shooting. After
pressure from Hispanic leaders and state and federal officials, a
grand jury reviewed the case again but did not have the nine votes
to indict.
   ``We are resigning because we cannot be party to this railroad
job performed by the state and district attorney's office,'' the
five grand jurors said in a statement Tuesday. ``We are willing to
risk the consequences, whatever they may be.''
   Chris Castillo, one of those who resigned, said the proceedings
were unfair, but he declined to elaborate. ``I'm just too upset
about it,'' she said. ``Maybe later, when I've gotten over it.''
   The district attorney said there is no provision in the law for
grand jurors to resign.
   ``It's kind of like being drafted _ you get selected and serve
that term of court,'' he said. The 12-member grand jury's term ends
in February.
   District Judge Weldon Kirk was researching the law to determine
if the grand jurors are in contempt of court, district clerk Bill
Erwin said.
   The League of United Latin American Citizens has said the case
is a watershed in Mexican-Americans' struggle for equal treatment
in the smaller cities of West Texas.
   They have said they want Williamson tried for civil-rights
violations in federal court because they perceive bias in the state
justice systems.
   Williamson told officials he was trying to arrest Gomez when
Gomez lunged at him with a knife. Williamson said he shot Gomez in
self-defense, and local investigators agreed.
   But an autopsy that LULAC hired an El Paso medical examiner to
perform concluded from the the wounds and bullet trajectories that
Gomez had his hands above his head.
   Gomez was shot in the side of the chest, in the back below the
shoulder blade and in the back of the head.

   The Bush administration's nominee to head
nuclear weapons production told Congress today controversy over his
selection was rooted mainly in popular opposition to nuclear power.
   Referring to his 23 years of service in regulating commercial
nuclear power, Victor Stello Jr. said, ``Nuclear power is an
inherently controversial subject and all decisions are subject to
criticism from one source or another.''
   At the start of his confirmation hearing, which is expected to
last at least three days, Stello told the Senate Armed Services
Committee his opponents also were motivated by a dislike of his
management style.
   ``I say what I think ... I'm aggressive, I'm not a diplomat ...
I can be abrasive,'' Stello said.
   The hearing opened on a note of confusion, with Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., the panel chairman, announcing that the White House and the
Justice Department had not yet provided letters, reports and other
materials on Stello requested several weeks ago.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, questioned whether the hearing should
go ahead since the missing materials might be important to members
questioning Stello's credentials.
   Glenn raised a series of questions about Stello's suitability
for the job, and Democratic Sens. Timothy Wirth of Colorado and
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts said in opening statements that
they would vote against Stello's nomination.
   Glenn and Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan, Albert Gore of Tennessee
and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico also are expected to oppose Stello.
Republican members John Warner of Virginia, Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina and Trent Lott of Mississippi told Stello they would
support his nomination.
   The committee has 20 members.
   In an unusual move, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins personally
introduced Stello to the committee and pleaded for his confirmation
to a post he called ``one of the toughest'' in the federal
government.
   Watkins called Stello ``the right person for this job, an
individual whose tough yet reasoned style meets my requirements.''
   To bolster his chances for committee approval, Stello this week
sent panel members a massive volume of his rebuttals to charges
that he is unqualified for the job and ill-suited to restore public
trust in the safety of operations at the weapons complex, which
includes 17 major defense facilities in 12 states.
   Stello's report was not made public.
   Even if the committee voted to recommend confirmation, it
appeared highly unlikely the full Senate would vote on the
nomination before its holiday recess next week.
   In a move interpreted by some as a sign that Watkins doubted
Stello's chances of winning Senate confirmation, Watkins late last
month told a top aide to take charge of the weapons office pending
the outcome of the Stello debate.
   Representatives of the environmental group Greenpeace U.S.A.,
which has led a national campaign against Stello's nomination, said
Tuesday they were disappointed the committee did not accept the
group's request to testify at today's hearing.
   ``If ever a nominee called for a thorough review process this is
it,'' said Stephen Schwartz of Greenpeace.
   On Monday, Wirth joined four other senators not on the committee
in urging President Bush to withdraw the nomination, which Watkins
had predicted would be controversial before it was announced in
July.
   The letter said the poor condition of the weapons facilities,
coupled with declining public trust in the Energy Department's
ability to safely operate the plants, made it imperative that the
credentials of the weapons production chief be unassailable.
   ``Even if confirmed, the controversy surrounding Mr. Stello
would critically impair his ability to address the management
failures of past administrations which have reduced our nuclear
weapons production program to a shambles,'' the letter said.
   The five senators cited a record by Stello of ``circumventing
health and safety regulations and obstructing investigations''
while serving at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   The letter was signed by Wirth and Democratic Sens. Richard
Bryan of Nevada, Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, Brock Adams of
Washington and Alan Cranston of California.
   The controversy surrounding Stello comes from his more than 20
years of work at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which regulates
commercial nuclear power, and the Atomic Energy Commission, the
predecessor of both the NRC and the Energy Department.
   The most recent incident, which sparked a congressional
investigation of Stello's conduct in 1987, involved unorthodox
procedures he used as NRC chief of staff in approving cash payments
to obtain information from a former utility employee.

   East German newspapers today appeared to dismiss
West Germany's offer of massive financial aid, and Mikhail S.
Gorbachev cautioned that ``exporting capitalism'' could hurt the
climate of cooperation in Europe.
   Also today, East Germany's official news agency said nearly half
its 16.5 million people have been issued visas for the West since
travel restrictions were lifted on Thursday.
   ADN quoted an unidentified Interior Ministry official as saying
7,765,881 visas for West Berlin and West Germany had been approved
by this morning.
   Economist Karl-Heinz Arnold told the Communist Party newspaper
Berliner Zeitung that East Germany can manage its own economic
recovery, an indication that Bonn's conditional aid offer may be
rejected.
   ``I don't see any need to dramatize the internal or external
financial situation'' of East Germany, Arnold was quoted as saying.
   The government newspaper Bauern-Echo, aimed at East Germany's
farmers, warned of becoming too greatly influenced by West Germany.
   ``Yes to unrestricted travel. No to an East German sellout,''
the paper declared. ``Yes to meeting again, no to reunification.
The two German states are politically and economically too
diverse.''
   There was no official response from the government to West
Germany's offer, which would require Easter Germany's ruling
Communists to fundamentally reform their centrally planned economy.
Communist officials have made clear they do not favor a full
free-market system.
   In Frankfurt, West Germany's third-largest bank said it would
seek to open an office in East Berlin. The proposal by Commerzbank,
however, requires the approval of authorities in both Germanys and
West Berlin.
   Gorbachev, believed to have encouraged the ouster of hard-line
East German leader Erich Honecker and the dizzying reforms that led
to the Berlin Wall's opening, warned Westerners not to gloat over
the demise of Communism in the East bloc.
   ``When accusations of `exporting revolutions' are replaced with
calls for `exporting capitalism,' we have at hand a dangerous
manifestation of old thinking,'' Tass paraphrased Gorbachev as
saying Tuesday in Moscow.
   Even leaders of New Forum, the East German opposition group
leading massive protest marches for democratic change, have
expressed concern that Western capitalists might exploit an
unstable East Germany without helping its people.
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper said outsiders should not
interfere with East Germany's economic reforms.
   ``East Germany needs no patronage. The society of East Germany
is strong enough to improve its economic performance,'' he said.
``The citizens want self-determination and do not want to exchange
the decades of Communist Party tutelage for the patronage of the
West German state or society.''
   West Germany's economics minister, Helmut Haussmann, offered
Tuesday to rebuild East Germany's economy through broad-based
investments and joint ventures and to overhaul it moribund
communications and transport systems.
   While not offering details, Haussmann likened his plan to the
brainchild of U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall that
revitalized postwar Western Europe with an infusion of $12 billion.
   But he said such aid would be made available only if East
Germany carried out a ``thorough change'' of its centrally planned
economy.
   East Germany's new premier, Hans Modrow, is known to favor
gradual economic change and oppose a swift transition to full
democracy.
   Modrow, a 61-year-old Communist reformer confirmed by Parliament
as premier on Monday, has resisted recognition of unofficial groups
as viable opposition forces or negotiating partners.
   Modrow has said the government has no intention of tearing down
the Berlin Wall, which it opened to free travel in an effort to
halt an exodus of refugees and appease a public that has taken to
the streets en masse since early October to demand free elections
and other reforms.
   In the newest challenge to the Communists' supremacy, Parliament
Speaker Guenther Maleuda said Tuesday he would seek to amend the
constitution so the Communist Party is no longer deemed the leading
force in society.
   Maleuda, elected by Parliament Monday in the chamber's
first-ever secret ballot, made the remark at a meeting of his
Democratic Peasants Party _ one of the four formal opposition
parties that have recently begun to assert independence.
   The Liberal Democratic Party also called for increased
power-sharing. It urged convening talks, to include the unofficial
opposition, patterned after negotiations held in Poland that helped
usher in the Solidarity-led government.
   In a development heralding the possible inclusion of another
prominent reformer in the government, Politburo member Guenther
Schabowski resigned as Berlin's Communist boss.
   Schabowski, the party's propaganda chief, had announced
Thursday's opening of East Germany's borders. His resignation was
considered a possible prelude to his appointment to an influential
post in the government.
   A celebration began at the Brandenburg Gate on Tuesday after ADN
said the East Germany leadership was contemplating a new hole in
the Berlin Wall that would reconnect the central monument with the
West.
   In West Berlin, revelers who waited in excited anticipation of
reopening of the famed thoroughfare dwindled to a few hundred after
dawn when rumors spread that the new East-West crossing would open
only on Thursday.
   East Germany's Red Cross said, meanwhile, that it is setting up
reception centers for any East Germans who fled to the West and now
want to return.
   It said the centers can handle up to 10,000 people. The West
German Red Cross said it did not expect many of the 200,000 who
have fled to the West this year to return.
   The emigration has seriously depleted East Germany's labor force.

   The lone elected black member of Miami's city
commission attributed his re-election to ``tri-ethnic'' support,
although ballots were cast mainly along ethnic lines in this
racially tense city.
   Miller Dawkins was re-elected in Tuesday's runoff by carrying
nearly 99 percent of the black vote and 75 percent of the non-Latin
white vote.
   Dawkins' Cuban-born challenger, Joe Carollo, carried the largest
bloc of votes, Hispanics, with 78 percent.
   With all 86 precincts and absentees counted, Dawkins, a two-term
incumbent, had 18,245 votes, or 52.7 percent, to 16,402 votes, or
47.3 percent, for Carollo.
   ``I got the majority of the black votes, I got enough of the
Latin to win away from a Latin opponent, and I got the white
votes,'' Dawkins said. ``So that's why I have a tri-ethnic vote.''
   Carollo, a former commissioner, had Spanish-language ads
suggesting ``all the Cubans vote for Carollo.''
   On the other hand, Dawkins, 64, had said he didn't believe his
was ``the black seat,'' but added that the city's black residents _
about 30 percent of the voters _ deserved representation on the
commission.
   The turnout among Hispanic voters was 40.5 percent, black
turnout 35.6 percent, and non-Latin white turnout 22.6 percent.
   When Dawkins is sworn in, he will become the only black on the
city commission. Athalie Range, who is black, had been appointed
last summer to complete Rosario Kennedy's term but did not seek
election on Tuesday.
   In Tuesday's other race, Kennedy, 44, lost a bid to regain her
seat to Miriam Alonso, 48. Ms. Alonso received 17,561 votes, or
53.2 percent, compared with Ms. Kennedy's 15,461 votes, or 46.82
percent.
   ``Miriam Alonso is going to bring a voice that is going to be
the voice of the people, the voice of Miami,'' Ms. Alonso said
after her victory. ``I'm going to be working with everyone in the
city of Miami to prove that I can be the person that will unite
Miami.''
   Dawkins, a college administrator, led a six-candidate primary
Nov. 7 by 691 votes. He was supported by some Hispanic leaders who
said it was important symbolically to have at least one black
commissioner.
   Carollo, a 34-year-old former policeman who served two terms
before losing the 1987 election, ran a slashing campaign that
linked Dawkins with a drug trafficker and called him the worst
commissioner in Miami history.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez, last week easily re-elected to a new
four-year term, called Carollo disruptive and supported Dawkins.
   Ms. Kennedy, who resigned her seat to run unsuccessfully for
Congress, charged Ms. Alonso with ``a penchant for demagoguery.''
   Her commercials called Ms. Alonso ``an opportunist who does not
respect the law,'' a reference to a 1988 court decision that
knocked Ms. Alonso off the Metro-Dade Commission ballot because of
a residency violation.
   Ms. Alonso concentrated her campaign among Hispanic voters. She
picked up 65.3 percent of the Hispanic vote to Ms. Kennedy's 34.7
percent. Ms. Kennedy carried the other ethnic groups.

<HEAD>Denver Housing Authority Director Resigns Amid Furor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of the Denver Housing Authority has
quit after 33 years with the agency, citing blame heaped on him
over a plan to move poor people into middle-class neighborhoods.
   ``Everybody has called for my head without cause,'' Bill
Ratzlaff said Tuesday. ``The focus has turned from housing to
witch-hunting, head-hunting, which has really taken away from what
the housing authority is all about.''
   Ratzlaff began working for the agency as a handyman in 1956 and
had been director since 1976. He supervised public housing for
27,000 people and earned $70,000 a year.
   Ratzlaff and his staff were faulted, most notably by Mayor
Federico Pena, for misjudging community concerns about a plan to
relocate several hundred residents of inner-city projects to homes
in middle-class neighborhoods.
   Pena said Ratzlaff's departure will restore public confidence in
the agency and added that he didn't agree with the five-member
housing commission's decision to keep Ratzlaff on as a consulant at
his annual salary.
   The approach of scattering public housing in middle-class
neighborhoods has been tried in various cities, with the goal of
avoiding the drug and crime problems that plague big, inner-city
projects.
   Opponents say it simply transplants problems and can isolate
those involved from social services and public transportation that
they rely on.

<HEAD>Striking Soviet Miners Lose Appeal of Court Ruling Walkout Illegal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Russian Federation's Supreme Court has upheld
a ruling that a strike by Arctic coal miners is illegal and that
organizers could lose their jobs and face stiff fines, a strike
leader said today.
   ``The consequences will follow us the rest of our lives,''
Nikolai A. Teryokhin told reporters. He said the ruling was made
Tuedsay.
   About 15,000 miners at 12 of the 13 shafts in the Vorkuta coal
fields, 950 miles northeast of Moscow, walked off the job Oct. 25
to press the government to fulfill promised improvements in working
and living conditions and to implement far-reaching political
reforms.
   They defied calls by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and other officials to return to work, even
though the walkout is depleting fuel supplies as the country heads
into winter.
   Tass reported Tuesday the strike has cut coal deliveries from
the region's mines by more than a half-million tons, and the
government daily Izvestia said Vorkuta's electricity and heating
supplies were threatened because of a coal shortage. First Deputy
Premier Lev Voronin says rationing of heat, light and electricity
may be necessary.
   On Oct. 27, the Supreme Court of the Komi Autonomous Republic,
where Vorkuta is located, said the strike ``grossly violated'' a
labor law passed by the Supreme Soviet legislature earlier in the
month. The court found the miners in violation of provisions of the
law that require conciliation and arbitration commissions to be set
up before a strike occurs.
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, which
includes the Komi Autonomous Republic, upheld the lower court's
decision, clearing the way for the sanctions to be imposed,
Teryokhin said. The court decision means the strike organizers face
firing from the jobs and fines of $1,620 each. The case cannot be
appealed to the national Supreme Court.
   The miners had asked that the ruling be set aside because they
contended proper court procedure was not followed.
   Four strike organizers are scheduled to meet with Ryzhkov in
Moscow on Friday to discuss the walkout, but their representatives
expressed little hope a solution will be reached.
   Virtually all the nation's coal miners ended a two-week strike
in July after the government passed a resolution promising reforms,
including improved social and economic conditions. The miners now
say the government is not fulfilling its promises.
   The workers also have advanced new political demands, including
removing language in the Soviet Constitution making the Communist
Party the leading force of society. They demand that power be
turned over to local governing councils, land to farmers and
factories to workers.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, given a roaring
welcome by Congress, today welcomed moves to send millions of
dollars of aid to Poland but said far more is needed to rescue his
nation's economy from ``the verge of utter catastrophe.''
   ``We are not asking for charity, or expecting philanthropy, but
we would like to see our country treated as a partner and a
friend,'' Walesa said in a historic speech to a joint meeting of
the House and Senate.
   A chorus of `Bravo, Bravo, Bravo,'' resounded through the jammed
House chamber as Walesa made his way to the podium. He stood in
silence as the ovation thundered on for seven minutes.
   ```We the people.' With these words I wish to begin my
address,'' Walesa started out, quoting the U.S. Constitution.
   Many members of Congress wore buttons reading, ``Solidarnosc,''
the Polish name of the Solidarity union movement.
   Walesa brought the cheers to their highest pitch when he raised
his arms and flashed a double ``V'' sign with his hands _ a symbol
favored in Poland by Solidarity supporters.
   After his speech, Walesa was meeting congressional leaders,
sitting down with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
returning to the Capitol for a dinner. He dined with President Bush
at the White House Tuesday night.
   Walesa's appearance marked only the second time a foreign
private citizen spoke to a joint meeting of Congress and the first
since the Marquis de Lafayette appeared in 1824.
   He used it to call on those in the West who are now praising
Solidarity to back their words with solid economic support.
   ``Being a worker and a man of concrete work, I must tell you
that the supply of words on the world market is plentiful, but the
demand is falling. Let deeds follow words now,'' the 46-year-old
onetime shipyard electrician said.
   As Walesa spoke in Polish, his audience read an English
translation, filling the chamber with the rustle of paper as they
turned each of the seven pages. An interpreter rendered his words
into English for a vaster television audience.
   Walesa was repeatedly interrupted with applause. It filled the
chamber as he concluded, walked from therostrum and pumped hands
all the way to the door.
   Walesa spoke as Congress worked to resolve differences over
legislation to send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to his
country.
   His speech in the House chamber came on the second day of a
week-long trip to the United States.
   The Senate voted 99-0 Tuesday to authorize $657 million in
economic aid to Poland over three years and $81 million for
Hungary, another East Bloc nation attempting to shed its rigidly
controlled economy.
   The House went further, approving an initial one-year
installment of $533 million for the two nations.
   In his speech, Walesa offered a lengthy history of the
Solidarity labor movement and Poland's economy under four decades
of communist rule.
   He said investment from abroad was the only way to avoid
economic collapse as the new Solidarity-led government shifts to a
market economy.
   Efforts to rebuild the economy face ``a grave danger'' because
of ``our long subjection to a political system incompatible with
national traditions, to a system of economy incompatible with
rationality and common sense, coupled with the stifling of
independent thought and disregard for national interests,'' Walesa
said.
   `` All this has led the Polish economy to ruin, to the verge of
utter catastrophe,'' he said.
   Walesa also took time to thank the American people for their
support of Solidarity during the 1980s. ``It is they who supported
us in the difficult days of martial law and persecution,'' he said.
``It is they who sent us aid, who protested against violence.
Today, when I am able to freely address the whole world from this
elevated spot, I would like to thank them with special warmth.''
   Walesa said the economic assistance planned by Congress ``opens
a new road'' to rebuild the Polish economy. ``For this wonderful
decision I thank you warmly. I promise you that this aid will not
be wasted and will never be forgotten,'' he said.
   Walesa told audiences Tuesday that Poland needs massive Western
investment to ``make her way to the shore of freedom.''
   ``I know that the pioneer spirit which made this country big and
free is still around,'' Walesa told a convention of the AFL-CIO
labor federation. ``I would like you to transplant this spirit to
Poland. ... Do not let the world and us wait any longer.''
   Walesa wept openly after a 15-minute standing ovation welcoming
him to the convention hall.
   He thanked the United States, its people, its labor movement and
its government for being ``our most steadfast allies'' in
Solidarity's long and bitter struggle with the communist regime it
eventually replaced in free elections.
   ``Today, when we are threatened by recession and inflation
rather than police repressions, we need this international
solidarity no less than in the past,'' he said.
   Walesa accepted the AFL-CIO's George Meany Human Rights Award,
which he won in 1981, two years before receiving the Nobel Peace
Prize.
   The eight-year delay in collecting the award was caused by
Walesa's fear he would be barred from returning to his country and
forced into exile.
   Walesa, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from
President Bush on Monday, told a news conference: ``Our country
needs your experience, your knowledge, your modern technologies.
   ``Sometimes we feel as if we are swimming chained hand and foot,
trying to summon all our energy just to make it safely to shore,''
Walesa said. ``And on the shore there is a cheering crowd of people
who offer us their admiration instead of simply throwing a life
belt.
   ``We want to make it to the shore, to join the community of
democratic countries with efficient economies,'' Walesa said.

<HEAD>Patient Says Psychic Healer Didn't Stop Her Pain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lesya Yurshova smiled for the TV camera while
doctors operated on her hernia with no other anesthetic than the
mental energy of one of the country's popular psychic healers.
   Eight and a half months later, however, she has stopped smiling
and started talking: she was in ``monstrous pain, which tormented
me from the first minute of the operation until the end.''
   Her revelation in an interview with the weekly Literaturnaya
Gazeta was the most damaging of several reports this week clouding
the reputation of Anatoly M. Kashpirovsky, which quickly drew the
attention of many Soviets.
   Kashpirovsky is one of the two best-known healers who have
gripped Soviet society this year with their claims to be able to
cure illnesses with mental energy, even over TV. Many people have
turned to them out of despair over a medical system in which many
medicines are not available, and much of the equipment and
scientific knowledge is out of date.
   Miss Yurshova underwent the operation in the capital of the
Georgian republic, Tbilisi, while Kashpirovsky was hundreds of
miles away. His mental energy, transmitted to Miss Yurshova over
television, was to block the pain. The operation helped build
Kashpirovsky's reputation as a healer among Soviets.
   She said in the interview published in Wednesday's edition of
Literaturnaya Gazeta, that she endured the pain _ and even smiled
for the camera _ because she did not want to let him down.
   The faith healer promised she would feel nothing worse than a
mosquito bite, and that after recovering that she would travel
abroad to advertise his method, Miss Yershova said.
   In a TV session shown Tuesday night on the late evening program
``Good Evening, Moscow,'' Kashpirovsky claimed that Miss Yurshova
attacked him only because he did not send her abroad as promised.
Kashpirovsky, staring straight into the TV camera with his dark
eyes, also told his followers he could not be blamed for ``pure
coincidences.''
   Kashpirovsky and another healer, Alan Chumak, have appeared all
over the Soviet Union, including at news conferences at the Soviet
Foreign Ministry's information department. Their popularity has
spread widely through their exposure on television.
   Citing viewer surveys that indicate many people believe Chumak's
sessions have helped them, the Tass news agency said that beginning
Wednesday, Radio Moscow's world service would begin transmitting a
5-10 minute program with the healer in more than 10 languages.
   Miss Yurshova said she broke her silence because of her
worsening health and Kashpirovsky's indifference. Her eyesight and
hearing have worsened and she suffers headaches and chest pain, she
said.
   ``After the operation, which was another step toward Olympus for
Anatoly Mikhailovich, he became indifferent to my fate, and he told
me so,'' she told the respected newspaper.
   Leningrad TV reported earlier this week on claims that a
7-year-old boy lost consciousness and was paralyzed after watching
one of Kashpirovsky's televised sessions.
   Doctors familiar with the boy's case told the daily
Komsomolskaya Pravda the boy was suffering from an infection of the
brain, and that Kashpirovsky had nothing to do with it one way or
the other.
   In another case detailed by the Communist Party daily Pravda on
Wednesday, a Moscow cooperative is being investigated for allegedly
trying to organize a phony healing session in the southern city of
Krasnodar for an advance price of $97,000.
   Officials said they have determined Kashpirovsky was not
involved in the plan.

   The White House said today an unprecedented
48-hour cutback in naval operations is ``important for the safety
of the Navy'' and would not compromise U.S. readiness at sea.
   ``It's exactly the right thing and it was done in the right
manner,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The unprecedented operations cutback and 48-hour safety check _
designed to stem the string of deadly accidents plaguing the
service _ was announced Tuesday by Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, the
chief of naval operations.
   He ordered that a ``safety stand-down'' be conducted at all Navy
facilities within three days.
   Fitzwater said the order ``does not involve the front-line
forces and those in places like the Med(iterranean) and the Indian
Ocean and so forth that are involved in militarily sensitive
situations.''
   The spokesman said President Bush did not have advance notice of
the safety review because ``it's an administrative action that the
Navy has taken ... and there was no need to notify the White
House.''
   However, Fitzwater added, ``We do support it. We think it's
important for the safety of the Navy.''
   Trost, in announcing the decision, told reporters that ``prudent
leadership demands that we take a look at everything that might be
a possible cause for this recent spate of accidents, regardless of
their severity.''
   The order requires ships, flying squadrons and shore facilities
to interrupt normal operations and review basic safety and
operating procedures.
   However, it allows such operations as ship movements in the
Persian Gulf and drug-interdiction activities to continue, the
four-star admiral said.
   ``A stand-down ... does not say, bring ships in from sea, stop
flying airplanes completely. ... Clearly, operations around the
world must continue,'' Trost said.
   In his statement, Trost told fleet commanders and other senior
Navy leaders that they should ``leave no stone unturned to ensure
the safety of operations is foremost in the minds of all hands.''
   The order also requires all commanders to report their findings
after the 48-hour interruption in operations.
   The action came as the Navy has suffered through a series of
mishaps since Oct. 29 in which 10 people have been killed or lost
at sea and at least 53 people injured.
   Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 1, the Navy counted 101 ``operation and
training related'' fatalities in the service, including 47 in the
explosion aboard the USS Iowa on April 19.
   The admiral defended the Navy's safety record, saying that
absent the Iowa fatalities, this would be the service's safest year
in this decade.
   Trost said he has found no common thread in the recent spate of
accidents, that some were due to mechanical failure while others
were caused by human error, such as a lapse of attention to
procedure.
   He said he did not believe commanders were working their sailors
too hard, but he wanted to ensure that no short cuts were being
taken during the many dangerous activities that Navy personnel must
conduct every day.
   The admiral said all commanders should ask: ``Are we adhering to
all the proper procedures, are we doing what we should be, the way
we should be doing it? ... Is there something we're overlooking?
Are people getting careless?''
   ``I would say there are three problems here,'' James Webb, who
was Navy secretary during part of the Reagan administration, said
today on ``CBS This Morning.'' ``One is the continuous operating
environment where you can get careless. The second is the technical
nature of the equipment, but I would say by and large the people
are very good right now.
   ``The third is the training environment, teaching people how to
anticipate problems and to make sure ... junior leaders are
supervising when the people under them are in a dangerous
environment,'' Webb said.
   Overall, the Navy has 599,000 full-time personnel and some 566
ships _ and usually a third of those are at sea for training
operations at any one time.
   The announcement came as three more incidents were added to the
Navy's accident list:
   _A Navy F-14 jet fighter crashed in the Gulf of Mexico 60 miles
northwest of Key West, Fla., with the crew escaping serious injury.
   _A fire broke out aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Inchon
in Norfolk, Va., injuring 31 people, as the vessel was undergoing
shipyard maintenance.
   _A Navy ordnance technician suffered minor burns and possible
eye injuries when an experimental explosive mixture detonated in a
research laboratory at the Naval Surface Weapons Testing Center in
White Oak, Md.
   In recent weeks, the service has been plagued by a number of
deadly accidents including a training jet crashing into an aircraft
carrier off Florida in which five people were killed; sailors who
have been washed overboard on two different aircraft carriers and
the accidental bombing of a ship by a Navy pilot in the Indian
Ocean.
   On Monday, the destroyer USS Kinkaid and a freighter collided in
the Malacca Strait, 240 miles northwest of Singapore, killing one
Navy crewman, injuring five, and starting fires on both vessels.
   Last Thursday, a Navy reserve pilot flying an A-7E jet crashed
into an apartment complex in Smyrna, Ga., killing two civilians and
injuring two others, including himself.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, called the action ``a prudent step.''
   ``If I were the secretary of the Navy today I would be taking
the exact same steps,'' said Warner, a former Navy secretary.
   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., a member of the House Armed Services
Committee, said that although the recent accidents didn't appear to
be related, it was a ``very wise move'' on the Navy's part to
review safety procedures.
   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical
materials, also said the Navy's decision was wise, but he added
criticism of the service's leadership.
   In particular, he complained the Navy has decided to make Capt.
Fred Moosally, skipper of the USS Iowa, eligible for another major
command.
   The Iowa explosion killed 47 sailors, including the gunner's
mate that the Navy later said ``most likely'' caused the blast
intentionally.

<HEAD>German Drama Forces Britain to Rethink its Place in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drama in East Germany is forcing Britain to
ponder anew its place in Europe.
   Some analysts say now is the time to get into closer step with
the Continent, to join forces in order to absorb a unified German
colossus and thus render it harmless.
   Others argue the opposite: that as the old order unravels and
long-held certainties disintegrate, Britain should keep its
distance and wait for the dust of the crumbling Berlin Wall to
settle.
   The question of Britain's place in Europe is an old one, but it
had become urgent well before the momentous changes overtook
Poland, Hungary and the Germanys.
   The 12-nation European Economic Community, of which Britain is a
member, is to become a single tariff- and passport-free trading
bloc at the end of 1992, and has ambitious plans for monetary union
and Europe-wide standards on workers' rights and social welfare.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the crusading free-marketeer,
believes these are corporatist tendencies, and that the EEC
bureaucracy in Brussels is trying to foist on her the very
socialist constraints she has fought for 10 years to eradicate in
Britain.
   Economic and monetary union, which France is pressing, would be
an intolerable encroachment on national sovereignty, says Mrs.
Thatcher.
   The EEC, she insists, is primarily a trading bloc, and that by
unshackling the markets, abolishing currency controls and opening
Britain to outside investment, she is being a good European.
   She repeated this position Monday, signaling that events in
Germany had not changed her mind at all. But the conflicting
reactions to her speech underlined the differing attitudes. While
The Times of London praised ``Mrs. Thatcher's realism,'' the
Guardian denounced her as ``the supreme nitpicker of Europe.''
   Britons who share Mrs. Thatcher's view ``tend to see the
internal market as the end of a process, while the others see it as
the beginning of something more dynamic,'' said Vernon Bogdanor, a
constitutional expert at Oxford University.
   Until recently, Mrs. Thatcher's approach seemed like smart
politics. The British never have shared the Continent's romantic,
philosophical notion of ``Europe.''
   They sometimes seem to relish being odd nation out, whether in
refusing to join the exchange rate mechanism that harmonizes the
European currencies, or in resisting attempts by Brussels to impose
new health warnings on cigarette packs.
   They cling to what sets them apart, whether it's driving on the
left or measuring distances in miles. Their biggest-circulation
newspaper repeatedly derides the French as ``Frogs,'' and union
featherbedding is known as ``Spanish practices.''
   In the election campaign for the European Parliament in June,
Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party built its propaganda around the
specter of interfering EEC bureaucrats, complete with feeble puns
about force-feeding the British on Brussels sprouts.
   But the Tories were routed by the opposition Labor Party, and
many analysts sensed a sea change in public opinion. Perhaps, it
was suggested, Europe-bashing was no longer a vote-catcher.
   The issue of the exchange rate mechanism triggered a crisis last
month that prompted the resignation of Nigel Lawson, chancellor of
the exchequer and architect of the boom of the mid-1980s. Now comes
a new and bigger challenge in the shape of Berlin.
   The pro-integrationists paint a scenario of a united Germany
with an economy as big and Britain's and France's combined. To
prevent Germany going neutral and drifting to the new markets of
Eastern Europe, Western Europe must tighten its bonds, thus tying
Germany inextricably to the EEC and dampening any temptation by
German to flex its nationalist muscle.
   The counterargument says harmonization of social law and
monetary union are difficult enough when economies as different as
Portugal's and West Germany's are involved. Add East Germany, and
later, perhaps, Hungary and Poland, and harmonization begins to
look like a joke.
   ``(For) those who worry about a Germany getting back to its old
style through reunification, the only answer is to bind Germany
more tightly and tightly to the Community,'' says former Prime
Minister Edward Heath, who took Britain into the EEC in 1973.
   ``If West Germany is going to be bound more tightly into the
Community, then we in Britain have got to be as well,'' he said
Wednesday. ``If we drag our feet, then they'll go ahead and just
leave us outside.''

<HEAD>Rock Aid Armenia Record Song To Aid Earthquake Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen of the biggest names in rock music have
recorded a remake of the Deep Purple classic ``Smoke on the Water''
to raise money for victims of the earthquake that devastated parts
of Soviet Armenia last year.
   The group, known as Rock Aid Armenia, launched the single at a
news conference Wednesday and said they hope to raise $1.6 million
from the single, an album and video. The single will be released on
Nov. 27.
   The all-star line-up includes Ian Gillan and Ritchie Blackmore,
formerly of Deep Purple, Dave Gilmour of Pink Floyd, Bruce
Dickinson of Iron Maiden, Keith Emerson of Emerson Lake and Palmer,
and Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen.
   Sitting beneath two moving logos of the charity Life Aid Armenia
and a black and white photo of an earthquake victim lying in
rubble, Gillan explained they were not looking for halos.
   ``We had a great time doing the record and we hope it's going to
do some good for the people of Armenia.
   ```Smoke on the Water' is ideal for something like this. It's a
song that was born out of disaster and ended up being a triumph,''
he said, explaining that the original was inspired by a lakeside
fire in Switzerland where Deep Purple were recording.
   Gillan and Tony Iommi, from Black Sabbath, are planning separate
trips to the Soviet Union and hope to visit Armenia.
   An album and a video made for Rock Aid Armenia will be released
Dec. 8. They feature additional classic tracks including songs from
Asia, Bon Jovi, Led Zeppelin, Foreigner, Mike and the Mechanics,

   Edouard Manet's ``La Rue Mosnier aux Drapeaux''
has been sold at auction for $26.4 million, a record for the artist.
   The oil-on-canvas painting of a Paris street bedecked with flags
commemorating the war dead was bought at Christie's auction house
Tuesday by an anonymous American dealer for the J. Paul Getty
Museum in Malibu, Calif.
   Another painting of the same street, with the same title, set
the previous auction record of $11.08 million for a Manet in 1986,
said Christie's spokeswoman Starr Collins.
   The painting that was sold on Tuesday was from the collection of
Paul Mellon.
   ``We are very happy to acquire a major work of the 1870s by
Manet, one which is compositionally inventive, penetrating in its
observation of Parisian street life and painted with a diverse and
brilliant technique,'' said George Golder, the Getty museum's
acting curator.
   Vincent van Gogh's ``Le Vieil If,'' or the old yew tree, also in
oil on canvas, sold for $20.35 million to an anonymous buyer,
Collins said.
   Pablo Picasso's ``Famille de l'arlequin,'' a representation of
acrobats from the artist's Rose period, sold for $15.4 million to
an American dealer, she said.

   The staff of the Polish Embassy, consisting
mainly of career Communist Party members, gave a collective gasp
when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa cheerfully said he hoped to see
them all in Poland soon.
   But Walesa, giving a pep talk to the embassy staff, assured them
he was just being friendly, that he thought they were doing a great
job improving relations with the United States, and that the
Solidarity-led government has no plans to call them home.
   ``I am not taking the place of the government. I am not
replacing anybody at the embassy,'' Walesa said.
   That was good news for Ambassador Jan Kinast, who served as
deputy foreign minister in the communist-led government that
preceded Solidarity to pwer and who has been working long hours
since then to rally U.S. economic support for the new reform
government.
   The embassy staff played virtually no role in arranging the
Walesa visit, which was sponsored by the AFL-CIO labor federation.
But its diplomats have had their hands full getting ready for
visits by many Polish government dignitaries and an unending stream
of U.S. congressional and administration figures headed for Poland,
Ryszard Krystosik, the No. 2 embassy official, said in an interview
this week.
   Many of Poland's foreign service professionals shared the
conciliatory sentiments expressed by Walesa.
   ``We should forget our differences,'' Walesa told them. ``We
have had many over the last 45 years. Many of those were caused by
others.''
   ``This is the time for ... all Poles to work together for
Poland,'' Walesa told the diplomats, assembled in the second floor
reception room of the stately turn-of-the century mansion atop
Meridian Hill in Washington. He spoke to them Tuesday during a
hectic week, and his remarks were recounted by three Poles who were
present.
   Walesa, who is chairman of the Solidarity trade union but holds
no government post, arrived in Washington on Monday on a trip that
includes numerous honors as well as non-stop exhortations for
Americans to send aid and investment to bolster the Polish reforms.
   His remark about seeing the Polish diplomats soon in Poland,
delivered at the end of a short pep talk, was taken in the same
good humor it was made, said one Pole who was present.
   ``It didn't have any overtones at all,'' said a Polish diplomat
who spoke on condition he not be further identified. ``He was very
courteous and was very well received.''
   Although courtesy cannot entirely ease the tension caused in the
diplomatic corps by the fall of the communist government after 45
years in power, Krystosik said the embassy staff is dedicated to
seeking U.S. aid to bolster the Poland's reform government.
   ``We know very well how important is the role of the United
States as the leader of the Western world. We know very well the
initiative of the United States organizing and sponsoring
assistance to Poland, a program that paves the way for the
implementation of Polish reforms,'' he said.
   ``The embassy presents the policy line of the government of
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki,'' the Solidarity adviser that
heads the government, said Krystosik.
   Besides, said other Polish diplomats, the presence of a
Solidarity rather than a communist government in Warsaw has eased
one of their main tasks, promoting U.S.-Polish friendship.
   Polish diplomats, showing a reporter around the embassy this
week, eagerly pointed out icons of Polish-American friendship,
including a letter to Thomas Jefferson from Thaddeus Kosciusko, a
Pole who served as a colonel in the American Revolution then
returned to Poland and led two uprisings against Russian domination.
   In one corner of the main reception area stands a Steinway grand
piano owned by Ignace Paderewski, who was Polish premier in 1919
and who performed many times in the United States as a reknowned
concert pianist.
   One Polish diplomat played a few bars on the piano, looked up
thoughtfully and said, ``we really ought to get this thing tuned.''

   The Nicaraguan government, in a bid to break
an impasse in negotiations with the Contras, has dropped its demand
for the immediate demobilization of the rebels, a Sandinista
official said today.
   Vice Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco said the government
instead is insisting, as its price for a restoration of a
cease-fire, the evacuation of the rebels from Nicaraguan territory
to Contra base camps in Honduras.
   ``We think that is a very important change in our position,''
Tinoco told a news conference at the Nicaraguan Embassy.
   When the two sides recessed Tuesday evening after their fourth
round of talks, Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Ovando y Bravo was
downcast as he spoke to reporters.
   ``I was more optimistic last Thursday (when the talks started)
than I am now,'' he said.
   The talks were to resume later today. The Sandinistas and the
Contras both agree a cease-fire should be a first step, but beyond
that there is a large gap between their respective positions.
   Meanwhile, President Bush said Tuesday that he is sending a
20-member congressional team to monitor the elections in Nicaragua,
and he vowed to make East Bloc arms shipments to Managua an issue
at the Malta superpower summit in 18 days.
   Bush said the Soviets can help facilitate free elections by
cutting off arms deliveries to Nicaragua, ``the one country that
seems to be swimming against the (democratic) tide.''
   Chief Contra negotiator Col. Enrique Bermudez said the
Sandinistas ``are conditioning everything on the withdrawal of our
forces from Nicaraguan territory and their demobilization.''
   The estimated 5,000 Contras based in Nicaragua, Bermudez said,
should be allowed to remain in place when the cease-fire goes into
effect.
   The two sides had been informally observing a cease-fire reached
in March 1988 but President Daniel Ortega, contending there had
been widespread violations by Contra forces, allowed the truce to
lapse Nov. 1.
   He has said that elections set for Feb. 25 will go ahead as
scheduled even if there is no settlement with the Contras. The
rebels are wary about demobilizing without ironclad guarantees that
they will be able to return in safety to a democratic Nicaragua.
   Bermudez complained that the Sandinista delegation refused to
consider a truce even for the duration of the peace talks.
   Helping to prod the delegations toward a settlement were
representatives from the United Nations and the Organization of
American States. They are members of the International Commission
for Support and Verification, which was set up to oversee the peace
process. Ovando y Bravo is attending the talks as a ``witness.''
   Bush alleged anew that the Sandinistas for their part are arming
the Marxist rebels in El Salvador.
   Salvadoran rebels are engaging in ``senseless bloodshed'' and
are ``aided and abetted by Nicaragua and the Cuban government'' in
Central America, Bush said Tuesday at a luncheon meeting for OAS
foreign ministers gathered here.
   The Salvadoran rebels launched the biggest offensive of their
10-year war over the weekend, virtually paralyzing much of San
Salvador and leaving hundreds dead.
   The State Department announced the administration was enlisting
retired diplomat Harry Shlaudeman to give advice and monitor the
Nicaraguan talks.
   Shlaudeman, 63, has agreed to work as a consultant to the
department but State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
he will not participate directly in the discussions nor have
substantive contact with Sandinista officials.
   Nonetheless, a senior official said Shlaudeman did have a
half-hour meeting in recent days with Sandinista diplomats at their
request. ``He was in a listening capacity,'' said the official,
asking not to be identified.

   The Nigerians were sent home Tuesday on a special flight of the
Saudi national airline, according to the independent Punch

   The 400 included men and women who had been living in Saudi

other Nigerians were sent home earlier this year.
   Most of the Nigerians had gone to Saudi Arabia on pilgrimages to
Mecca and elected to remain there, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>White House Has No Apologies for Extolling Capitalism as Remedy</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs graf 3, In reply, to remove repetitious first reference
to Fitzwater.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The White House said today ``we have no
apologies'' for extolling capitalism as a remedy for the economic
woes of Eastern Europe and said the U.S. position should not be
offensive to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The statement by White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
followed a warning by Gorbachev that the West should not gloat
about the demise of socialism or attempt to ``export capitalism.''
   Fitzwater said President Bush views the free-market economy of
the United States as the ``pride of the world and as a good way to
reform the economic problems that they are facing.
   ``We certainly are proud of the capitalist system and the
rewards that it has offered,'' he added. ``We hold it up as an
example to all but we have not tried to dictate it to any of these
countries.''
   Nevertheless, Fitzwater said, all the actions taken by the
United States ``have been appropriate and not been offensive and
have had the desired effect of offering our support without
inciting revolution or other actions that would take the process
backward ... We have no apologies or concern with anything that
we've done at this point.''
   Gorbachev said Westerners who claim the changes in the East
signify the failure of socialism are engaging in ``wishful
thinking.'' He did not say to whom he was referring. ``We are
expanding the potential of the socialist social system,'' he said
today.
   Bush, who will meet Gorbachev at a summit Dec. 2-3, declared
himself unconcerned Tuesday about the dizzying pace of change _
most recently the opening of East Germany's borders and the easing
of travel restrictions by Czechoslovakia.
   ``I don't think it's moving too fast and I don't know of anybody
in my administration that feels that it's moving too fast,'' the
president said.
   Even so, administration officials acknowledge they have been
surprised by the rapidly changing events.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said experts from
the State Department, National Security Council and other agencies
were evaluating developments in the wake of last week's opening of
the Berlin Wall.
   Fitzwater said that, rather than be preoccupied by the idea of
the reunification of Germany, ``there are large issues of East-West
relations, of the NATO-Warsaw Pact's future, of the status of the
Soviet empire as these countries change their relationship'' with
Moscow.
   ``All of those issues and questions are being considered by the
United States government at this time,'' he said. ``Obviously the
questions call for answers that will lead to changing relationships
and new policies and programs.''
   The changes in Eastern Europe will be at the top of the agenda
when Bush meets Gorbachev in the shipboard summit in the waters of
the Mediterranean off the coast of Malta.
   Despite heightened expectations, the United States is trying to
play down the summit.
   ``We still see it as an informal meeting where no decisions will
be made,'' said one administration official, insisting on anonymity.
   But some political leaders are expressing concerns about the
Malta meeting.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Forces Committee,
has warned that Bush should expect a proposal from Gorbachev to
withdraw all U.S. and Soviet armed forces from Europe within a few
years.
   The administration also has been warned that Gorbachev may
propose dismantling NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Bush spoke of the developments in Eastern Europe during a speech
to a gathering of foreign ministers from Latin American nations.
   ``I'm sure the people in every country here are caught up in
this fantastic change that's taking place,'' he said.
   Democrats are pressing Bush to respond more strongly to the
changes sweeping Eastern Europe.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said it was
regrettable that Bush had rejected the idea of going to Berlin to
express American satisfaction with the ``symbolic destruction'' of
the wall or to normalize trade relations with the Soviet Union.
   ``While the president has rejected all of these, he has reversed
himself on issues before and I hold out hope he will do so again,''
Mitchell said.
   For his part, Bush hailed the decision by Czechoslovakia, one of
the last hard-line Soviet bloc nations, to ease travel restrictions
on its citizens, calling it ``a very encouraging first step.''
   ``Several months ago we called for a Europe whole and free, and
as I survey the changes taking place, it seems to be moving towards
a Europe whole and free,'' Bush said.
   ``The people of Czechoslovakia have the same aspirations for
freedom that others have. And I would expect we'd see further
changes there, just as we have seen in Poland, Hungary and in (East
Germany).
   ``So it's a very good and encouraging step,'' he said. ``And
this is further manifestation that Europe some day will be whole
and free.''

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country:
   Nov. 10
   The Herald, Everett, Wash., on East Germany:
   The Iron Curtain is up. The Berlin Wall is down. Communism is on
the rocks, or so it seems, based on the most recent news from East
Germany.
   A propaganda minister for that nation announced ... the opening
of East German borders to unrestricted travel, a liberty denied
citizens since the infamous wall was erected in 1961. This dramatic
policy turnaround, although a long-awaited step toward freedom,
seems likely to accelerate the recent exodus from East to West.
   That could pose enormous social and economic difficulties for
both Germanys. So far in 1989 more than 200,000 discontent East
Germans have fled their country seeking better lives in West
Germany. As the East is losing its workers and young people, the
West is running out of jobs and housing.
   Not a moment too soon _ perhaps 28 years too late _ the East
German government has heard its citizens' demands. ...
   Egon Krenz, East Germany's new head of state, advocated a law
... that would ensure ``free, democratic general elections with a
secret ballot'' and with ``public supervision in every stage of the
balloting.'' ...
   Krenz also has been pleading publicly for his countrymen to
remain in their homeland and help build a new nation. Western
leaders should join in encouraging East German citizens to stay and
shape their free, democratic destiny.
   But why should East Germans heed this call and take a chance on
a bloody crackdown?
   That's nearly impossible to answer. Yet an active role by the
West might help push forward reforms and guard against a Tiananmen
Square-type massacre.
   West Germany Chancellor Helmut Kohl already has pledged to meet
with ... Krenz and has offered far-reaching aid if real political
and economic changes take root. President ... Bush and leaders of
the other Western European nations would do well to follow ...
Kohl's lead.

   Baraboo (Wis.) News-Republic on East Germany:
   There could be no greater symbol of the changes in Europe than
(the) announcement that the Berlin Wall no longer would stand in
the way of free travel for East Germans.
   The news must come as a special joy to the millions of veterans
in the United States who fought in two world wars to retain
freedoms in Europe. ...
   The Wall has stood for 28 years as a stark reminder that sharp
divisions existed between East and West.
   While the Wall was effective in holding East Germans hostage to
a totalitarian regime, it could not bend the minds of citizens who
knew its true meaning _ not a wall to protect them from the West,
but rather, a wall to prevent them from getting to the West.

   Delta Democrat-Times, Greenville, Miss., on Panama:
   If Hollywood made a movie of the Bush administration's handling
of recent events in Panama, it would be called ``The Gang that
Couldn't Coup Straight.''
   As more facts are revealed, the bungling becomes even more
embarrassing. A Newsweek cover story called it ``Amateur Hour,''
but that's an inaccurate tag. The men involved have years of
experience in government.
   This is one of the most credentialed administrations ever to
hold office. They should simply admit, ``We goofed. It's our
fault.'' ...
   Bush set the trap himself. He made the mistake of setting up
Gen. Manuel Noriega as a target, calling repeatedly for his ouster,
and working with the coup's unsuccessful plotters. ...
   Bush's best policy would be for him to simply say that the
United States has no compelling interest in overthrowing ...
Noriega. Such an assertion by ... Bush would be true leadership.
   However ruthless a thug ... Noriega is, he does no great harm to
U.S. interests. Even his arrest as part of the phony drug ``war''
would hardly dent the influx of drugs into our country.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on former presidents:
   Much has been reported and debated lately about the proper role
that ex-presidents should play. ...
   Current members of the exclusive fraternity are Richard Nixon,
Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.
   The consensus of scholars and self-proclaimed political experts
seems to be that of the four men, Carter is the model of public
behavior. ... Carter decided even before leaving the presidency
that he would not join any boards of directors or otherwise
``commercialize the presidency.'' ...
   Based on the citizenship Carter has demonstrated since leaving
office, he would be a welcome addition to public service.
   The same can't be said of the nation's other three living
ex-presidents. At least, it can't be said with as much enthusiasm.

   The Athens (Ohio) Messenger on Bush and abortions:
   Last year Republican presidential candidate George Bush found an
unlikely political ally in Willie Horton, a convict who raped a
woman after skipping out of a Massachusetts prison on a weekend
furlough.
   Rightly or wrongly, Bush invoked the Horton case as evidence his
Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, was more
concerned about criminals than about their victims.
   Now, the specter of ... Horton has come back to haunt the Oval
Office. During a congressional abortion debate, Rep. Steny H.
Hoyer, D-Md., raised these hypothetical questions: What if Horton
had impregnated his victim? Would President Bush want her to bear
(Horton's) baby? ...
   An aroused electorate is closely watching the uncomfortable
gyrations of politicians and subjecting them to an abortion litmus
test. Time will tell how many candidates will lose because of their
abortion positions _ or win despite them.
   Regardless, Bush should have approved the proposed abortion
funding for poor victims of violent sex crimes. He could have
emerged as a voice of compassion and reason. Instead, he seemed to
box himself into a narrow corner, far from the middle ground of the
majority.

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on homosexuals in the military:
   A recent Gallup Poll showed that 60 percent of Americans believe
that homosexuals should have a right to serve in the armed forces;
that figure is up from 52 percent in 1982. But if the public is
becoming more tolerant about homosexuals in uniform, the Pentagon
is not, judging from its reaction to a couple of studies on the
topic.
   The first study ... is on whether homosexuals are security risks.
   After reviewing the professional literature, the researchers
conclude that homosexuals posed no more of a risk to expionage
blackmail than heterosexuals. When the Pentagon saw an early draft,
it called the report flawed, biased and a waste of money. ...
   The Pentagon's overreaction was not due to the quality of the
report's scholarship, which is high, but to the fact that the
study's findings disagree with the current Pentagon policy to ban
all homosexuals, period.
   A second study by the center also set off fireworks. It found
that homosexuals who attempted to join the military had fewer
personal problems and were likely to adjust to military life ``as
good or better than heterosexuals.''
   Social attitudes are slowly changing on this issue: The
Pentagon's assumptions should change as well.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on the First Amendment:
   Figure this one: A national consumer group is asking Congress to
prevent a major American manufacturer from sponsoring an
advertising campaign commemorating _ get this, now _ the Bill of
Rights.
   The company in question is Philip Morris. The consumer outfit,
Public Citizen Health Research Group, says the promotion ``smears
the Bill of Rights with the blood of all Americans killed as a
result of smoking.''
   The cigarette manufacturer agreed to donate $600,000 toward
construction of an exhibit gallery in the National Archives and to
sponsor a series of television ads _ with archives cooperation _
celebrating the 200th anniversary of the adoption of the first 10
amendments to the Constitution.
   A spokesman for the Health Research Group says the agreement
allows Philip Morris to ``obscure its deadly role in American and
worldwide society'' and should be reversed. It has called upon
Congress to do the reversing.
   For heavens sake, we're talking the Bill of Rights here. If
anything is being obscured it's the First Amendment rights of a
perfectly legal business enterprise engaged in a perfectly
honorable celebration of American freedoms.
   Under the First Amendment, the Public Citizen Health Research
Group is free to condemn smoking, tobacco manufacturing, government
subsidies of tobacco growers or anything else.
   It is decidedly not free to prevent anybody _ including the
tobacco industry _ from coming out in favor of the Bill of Rights.

   Los Angeles Times on the stealth bomber:
   Congress is poised to pay for at least two more B-2 stealth
bombers at $530 million each, the most expensive airplane in the
nation's history. But it also has attached enough strings to make
certain that the B-2 does not fly away with the defense budget.
   That makes sense, in light of a study that says that the United
States would spend 14 timesas much to hit a target with a B-2 as it
would have to spend to hit the same target with alternative weapons
already on hand...
   In theory, the B-2 could pounce on targets before an enemy knew
it was coming. But according to a recent analysis published by
Harvard University's International Security magazine, using a B-2
would cost more than using a Midgetman missile, a single-warhead
missile that the Air Force has resisted as too expensive.
   In fact, the ability to sneak past radar may not even be
important in a war. The bomber would reach targets in the Soviet
Union long after the United States had started retaliating with
long-range missiles that might well have destroyed or at least
ripped big holes in the radar screen of the Soviet air-defense
network, so stealth would not be important.
   If some radar were to survive, there are nearly 100 B-1b bombers
already on duty that the Air Force says are nearly as elusive as
the B-2. ...
   Stealth bombers would be good for dropping bombs that would
burrow into Soviet command posts and explode, the Air Force says.
But does that mission make sense? Would America want to kill the
only Soviets who might be able and willing to call off a nuclear
war?

<TEXT>
   Government TV on Wednesday broadcast
an appeal for peace by a radical Sinhalese leader that was
videotaped while he was in custody and hours before he was shot to
death by government troops.
   Officials also reported finding the bodies of 31 suspected
Sinhalese radicals Wednesday and blamed the killings on vigilantes
in favor of the Sinhalese-dominated government in a country wracked
by ethnic and factional strife.
   ``I appeal to all my followers to give up their armed struggle
against the government and take to the democratic process to
achieve our goals,'' said Rohana Wijeweera, the founder of the
People's Liberation Front, in the broadcast.
   Wijeweera, who was captured Sunday, voluntarily made the appeal
for peace and ``sang like a bird'' about the whereabouts of his top
lieutenants, said a senior military source. He and the front's No.
2 and No. 3 men were shot and killed within the next 18 hours,
according to government announcements.
   The avowed Marxist, who used to have a beard and mustache, was
clean-shaven and the television clip showed him wearing a red beret
and a white shirt. He looked nervous but appeared to be in good
health while making the Sinhalese-language broadcast.
   The government said Wijeweera led security personnel to the
group's Colombo headquarters Monday to question D.B. Herath, the
third-ranking leader of the front.
   ``Herath pulled a pistol and began firing at Wijeweera and
troops opened fire, killing both of them,'' said Foreign Minister
Ranjan Wijeratne.
   The front's No. 2 man, Upatissa Gamanayake, was killed while
trying to escape capture Monday, the government said.
   Political leaders sypathetic to the front predicted more
violence could follow the death of Wijeweera, whose personal safety
had been guaranteed by President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
   Samuel Dias Bandaranaike, leader of the Sri Lanka Progressive
Front, said the public would not believe the government's version
of Wijeweera's death.
   The 31 bodies of suspected members of the group were discovered
Wednesday in the central hills and were likely killed by
pro-government vigilante groups, said the officials, who cannot be
identified under briefing rules.
   More than 6,000 people have been killed since August 1987 when
the People's Liberation Front started assassinating government
officials and supporters. The front professed outrage that the
Sinhalese-dominated government was making concessions to the Tamil
minority, and its battle escalated into a challenge of the
government's right to exist.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
are mostly Hindus and claim the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese
majority discriminate against them in jobs and education.

<HEAD>Analysts See Warning in Inventory Growth</HEAD>

   Growth of business inventories outpaced
business sales in September, the government said Wednesday in a
report that analysts said contained a warning of growing backlogs
due to the slowing economy.
   The Commerce Department reported that inventories held on
shelves and backlots climbed 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$791.8 billion after advancing 0.4 percent in August.
   Business sales, on the other hand, fell 0.3 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $524.6 billion following a 3 percent gain the
previous month.
   The business activity produced a slight increase in the
inventory-to-sales ratio to 1.51, meaning it would take 1.51 months
to exhaust inventories at the September pace. It was 1.50 in August.
   ``At the moment, the ratios do not appear excessive,'' said
Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co. ``But they show the
first signs of increases related to a declining business climate.''
   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago agreed that on the surface the report suggests inventories
are not yet a problem.
   ``But there are some warning signals in it of some excess at the
consumer level,'' he said.
   Inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as
output exceeds demand, a process that could lead to production cuts
and loss of jobs. The economy has been experiencing sluggishness as
the Federal Reserve tries to contain inflation by keeping a tight
rein on credit.
   Retail inventories, up 1 percent in September, were of
particular concern since an earlier report indicated they could be
worse in October. The Commerce Department said Tuesday that retail
sales fell a full 1 percent in October, including a 5.1 percent
decline in car sales.
   Manufacturers' inventories, which represent about 45 percent of
the total, slipped 0.1 percent and wholesale backlogs, accounting
for 25 percent of the total, dropped 0.3 percent.
   Manufacturers' sales, on the other hand, fell 1.6 percent in
September. Retail and wholesale sales both were up 0.7 percent.
   Overall inventories were 6.4 percent above those of a year ago.
Sales increased 6.7 percent over September 1988.

   The government Wednesday denied it was
trying to ``export capitalism'' to East Germany but reiterated that
its Communist neighbor must undertake major economic reforms.
   ``We do not export capitalism. We export a lot of things, but
not capitalism,'' chief government spokesman Hans Klein told The
Associated Press.
   Klein also indicated Chancellor Helmut Kohl may postpone a
crucial summit with East Germany until after an emergency Dec.
15-17 Communist Party congress that could choose a new party
leadership.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann has proposed a massive
economic aid program for East Germany, contingent upon concrete
reforms in its state-controlled economy.
   East Germany has promised sweeping economic reforms, without
elaborating on specific plans.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has warned Westerners not to
gloat over the shaky condition of communism in the East bloc and
cautioned that ``exporting capitalism'' could hurt the growing
climate of cooperation in Europe.
   On Saturday, Kohl said economic assistance to East Germany
cannot be successful unless the ``system of a state-planned
economy'' gives way to a ``socially responsible market economy.''
   Klein rejected any suggestion that West Germany wanted to impose
its own type of economic system on its Communist neighbor. He said
major economic reforms are needed if East Germany expects to
attract investors.
   ``We say there must be market conditions which make it
reasonable to invest there,'' Klein said.
   But he shied away from stating flatly that a drastic economic
overhaul in East Germany was a pre-condition for financial aid.
   Volker Ruehe, general secretary of the Christian Democrats, said
there were some ways to help East Germany soon, including renewal
of its telephone communications network and environmental projects.
   But ``far-reaching changes in the current economic system'' are
needed for East Germany to be able to attract desperately needed
private investment, Ruehe said.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leader of the Free
Democratic Party, said Bonn should not set conditions for its aid.
He did say reform must show ``definite signals,'' without
explaining what the signals should be.
   ``We must tell them we are ready to be helpful,'' said Juergen
Chrobog, Genscher's chief spokesman.
   At a news conference earlier in the day, Klein indicated Kohl
may postpone his summit with East German leaders until the end of
December.
   Kohl initially said he would meet with East German Communist
Party chief Egon Krenz either this month or in early December to
discuss East Germany's direction and possible financial assistance.
   But Kohl's latest position is that the meeting will occur
``sometime this year,'' Klein said.
   That left open the possibility the summit would be put off until
after the Communist Party emergency congress.
   Rudolf Seiters, Kohl's chief of staff, plans to fly to East
Berlin on Monday to prepare Kohl's visit. Kohl on Wednesday met
with the heads of eight ministries to discuss the situation in East
Germany.

<HEAD>Nujoma Promises to Protect Individual Rights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former guerrilla leader who is
likely to become Namibia's first president promised Wednesday to
protect individual rights but said he might establish a one-party
political system.
   Sam Nujoma, leader of the leftist South-West Africa People's
Organization, also said he would try to avoid dealings with the
white-run government in South Africa, which is ceding control of
Namibia after a 74-year rule.
   And he said English will become the sole official language of
Namibia's government and schools, with Afrikaans _ the language of
South Africa's dominant white group _ losing its official status.
   SWAPO, which began a guerrilla war for independence against
South Africa in 1966, was declared the winner Tuesday of United
Nations-supervised elections for an assembly that will draft a
constitution and declare independence.
   SWAPO will have 41 of the 72 seats in the assembly, which will
convene next week. At least 48 of the 72 members, or two-thirds,
must approve decisions by the assembly, and SWAPO will have to
bargain with at least some of the five other parties that won seats.
   The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a multiracial coalition that
favors a capitalist economy, has 21 seats. No other parties won
more than four seats.
   Nujoma said at a news conference that Namibians would not be
pressured to join SWAPO, but added: ``If the Namibian people chose
to go one-party and it is done at the polls democratically, it will
certainly be so.''
   Asked about civil liberties under a SWAPO-led government, he
replied: ``Certainly there will be freedom of the press, freedom of
assembly, freedom of movement, freedom of association, and there
will be also be freedom of religion.''
   ``We have no intentions of imposing our views on others and
anticipate no serious disagreements,'' Nujoma said. ``We stand
ready to be guided by the democratic principles of open discussion
and decision by the majority.''
   The last 1,500 South African troops will be withdrawn Nov. 23,
said Louis Pienaar, the territory's South Africa-installed
administrator. Most soldiers left by June, and remaining units have
been confined to two northern bases.
   Nujoma said his future government would demand that South Africa
surrender control of Walvis Bay, a South African enclave which
serves as Namibia's only deep-water port. South Africa says its
ownership of Walvis Bay is upheld by international law, but Foreign
Minister Pik Botha on Wednesday offered to negotiate terms of usage
of the harbor.
   ``I have always said there are two South Africans: one led by
white-minority settlers there _ that one we certainly will not deal
with,'' Nujoma said. ``But we respect non-racial South Africa _
that's why we will deal with it.''
   SWAPO wants to declare independence as soon as possible, but
Nujoma declined to set a date. Most observers believe Namibia will
become independent early next year as long as there are no serious
hitches in writing the constitution.
   During his 30 years in exile, Nujoma, 60, and his movement were
considered orthodox Marxists. Since SWAPO leaders began returning
to Namibia earlier this year, however, they have taken a more
moderate approach.
   Nujoma said SWAPO favors some government controls on the
economy, welcomes foreign investors and wants good relations with
East and West. He has repeatedly urged Namibia's 75,000 whites, and
civil servants in particular, to remain in the territory and help
develop the emerging nation.

   Angry farmers and radical students
demanding an end to U.S. food imports protested in about two dozen
cities and rural areas Wednesday, hurling rocks and firebombs at
police.
   In Kunsan, 130 miles southwest of Seoul, protesters threw rocks
and firebombs at the main gate of a U.S. Air Force base, demanding
a ban on food imports, U.S. authorities said.
   South Korean police arrested five students. U.S. officials
reported minor damage to a guardhouse, but no injuries.
   About 2,000 students and farmers hurling firebombs and rocks
battled riot police at Konkuk University in eastern Seoul after
they were prevented from marching into the street to protest the
police blockade of their planned rally.
   The protesters demanded the downfall of President Roh Tae-woo as
riot troopers, backed by armored vans firing tear gas, made
repeated charges to drive them back.
   ``Drive out the Yankees who enforce the opening of agricultural
markets!'' the protesters chanted. They say cheap U.S. imports
threaten their livelihood.
   Police reported no injuries but said about 500 farmers and
students were arrested in Seoul.
   Protesters gathered at Konkuk after some 7,000 riot police were
deployed around Seoul's Yoido Plaza to foil the farmers' rally
demanding an end to U.S. imports and also seeking an increase in
prices for domestic farm products.
   Police blocked the rally after Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon
ordered security forces Tuesday to launch a crackdown to block
anti-government rallies by students, workers and farmers.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said groups of farmers
held protests and sit-ins in about 20 rural areas, occupying
government and political party offices, after police checkpoints
blocked them.
   Police said about 8,000 farmers were blocked from leaving for
Seoul across the country.
   About 100 farmers occupied an opposition party office in Naju
near the southern city Kwangju after police stopped them from
leaving for Seoul, Yonhap said.
   The United States, which buys about 35 percent of South Korea's
exports and ran an $8.6 billion trade deficit with the country last
year, has been pressing for greater access to South Korean markets.
Seoul is reluctant to open agricultural markets to protect farmers.
   Dissidents and radical students are supporting farmers to try to
expand anti-government forces.

   Abortion foes today savored their biggest
victory since the U.S. Supreme Court opened the way in July _ the
Pennsylvania Legislature's passage of the most restrictive abortion
law in the country.
   ``It's a very bright day for Pennsylvania's national image,''
said Mary Beliveau, a leader of the Pennsylvania Pro-Life
Federation. ``Pennsylvania will stand out as a leader in the
nation. This legislation will be seen nationally as reasonable
legislation.''
   The bill, which bans most abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy
and requires women to inform their husbands before getting an
abortion, cleared the Senate 33-17 on Tuesday and goes to
Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey. The House passed the bill last
month.
   ``I'm told the bill is in the same form as it was when it left
the House,'' Casey said today. ``If that's the case, I'll sign it.''
   Abortion-rights advocates, after watching nine attempts to
dilute or revise the bill fail, warned that the Legislature was out
of step with national sentiment. ``It's a shame, a national
disgrace,'' said Sen. Vincent Fumo, a Democrat.
   Some predicted abortion opponents would be voted out of office.
   ``Having failed to change their minds, we will seriously commit
ourselves to changing their faces on Election Day,'' said Chris
Niebrzydowski, president of the state chapter of the National
Organization for Women.
   Pennsylvania stands to become the first state to enact controls
on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court in Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services opened the way for new curbs. The
court upheld a Missouri law banning the use of public funds or
facilities for abortions and requiring tests after 24 weeks of
pregnancy to determine whether the fetus could survive outside the
womb.
   The Pennsylvania bill expands on earlier restrictions in banning
most abortions in public hospitals. It also bans abortions for the
purpose of selecting the baby's sex; prohibits abortions after the
24th week of pregnancy unless the mother faces death or
irreversible harm; establishes a 24-hour waiting period after an
abortion is requested, and requires women to notify their husbands.
An unmarried woman would not have to notify the father.
   The legislation also would require doctors to inform a woman of
the age of the fetus before performing an abortion and explain the
risks and alternatives. It also would regulate the medical use of
tissue from aborted fetuses.
   ``What the bill does is put some sensible guidelines into law to
try to protect the life of an unborn child,'' said Republican Sen.
Edward Helfrick. ``It doesn't prevent abortion, it just restricts
it.''
   Republican Rep. Stephen Freind, who drafted the bill and guided
it through the House, said: ``It's a big win; it's a big margin,
it's great.''
   Freind had said that the bill was designed as a direct challenge
to Roe vs. Wade and that he hopes it becomes the vehicle for the
Supreme Court to overturn its 1973 decision establishing the right
to an abortion.
   Passage of the bill puts the pro-choice movement in a quandary,
forcing it to decide whether to challenge the law and risk losing
Roe vs. Wade.
   Doctors performing abortions after 24 weeks or because of the
sex of the fetus could receive up to seven years in prison and up
to $15,000 in fines. A husband could seek damages against a doctor
who performs an abortion without a form showing that he had been
notified.
   Rep. Gerard Kosinski, a Democratic supporter of the bill, said
the bill seeks penalties against doctors because they have ``duties
over and above what normal people would have.''
   ``The focus is not, absolutely not, on the woman having the
abortion,'' he said. The woman should never be penalized for having
an abortion.''
   Pennsylvania's Legislature has traditionally been anti-abortion,
even though many polls show that most Pennsylvanians are
pro-choice. The state has a large rural, conservative population,
and both sides agree that the anti-abortion movement has been more
efficient politically than the pro-choice side, employing
picketing, phone calls and mass mailings.
   Over the past decade, the Legislature has several times passed
restrictions on abortion, but some of the more extreme portions
have been struck down by the courts.
   Passage of the bill comes after a series of victories elsewhere
by the abortion-rights side.
   Two weeks ago, voters in New Jersey and Virginia elected
governors with pro-choice positions. A special session of Florida
Legislature last month ended with lawmakers rejecting every
proposal to restrict abortions.
   Abortion foes in Illinois abandoned their attempts to get more
restrictions passed until next year after a bill stalled last month
in a House committee.
   The biggest anti-abortion victory since the Supreme Court ruling
came last month in Michigan, where the Senate approved a bill
requiring parental consent for a girl under the age of 18. That
proposal is under House consideration.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors exploring the body with tiny
ultrasound probes say they have embarked on ``a fantastic voyage,''
getting an inside view of the maze of blood vessels and the heart
itself.
   In scientific presentations Wednesday, doctors described
experimental use of the devices to make live cross-sectional
pictures that help them see problems and guide tools to fix them.
   ``It's a fantastic voyage,'' said Dr. Natesa Pandian. ``It's
almost like you are traveling inside the blood vessels and looking
around.''
   Several other doctors working with the new technique also
likened it to the exploits in ``Fantastic Voyage,'' a 1966 movie
starring Raquel Welch in which miniaturized doctors traveled
through their patient's bloodstream.
   Pandian and colleagues at New England Medical Center in Boston
are among about 20 teams around the world that have been testing
the new technology over the past two years. Several progress
reports were presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart
Association.
   Ultrasound is already widely used to take pictures from outside
the body. In the new approach, however, ultrasound-generating
crystals are put in the end of thin tubes called catheters and
pushed through the blood vessels.
   The result is a detailed inside look at the arteries, as well as
a cross-sectional view of their walls.
   ``It's the only technology we have in which we can actually
characterize what's in the wall'' of the blood vessel, said Dr.
Carl J. Pepine of the University of Florida.
   In many people with heart disease, fatty deposits clog the
arteries that feed their heart muscle. Doctors say the new
ultrasound probes should help them figure out the particular kind
of material that makes up these lumps so they can pick the best
tool to remove them.
   ``It's almost like live pathology, as though we had taken a
section of the heart or blood vessel, stained it and looked at it
under a microscope,'' said Pandian.
   Doctors can now use balloons that squeeze the fatty deposits out
of the way, cut them with miniature saws, and burn them off with
lasers.
   One drawback of some of the artery cleaning devices is that they
sometimes remove too much, breaking through the artery wall. With
the detail revealed by the new ultrasound pictures, doctors believe
they will know when to halt before they do more harm than good.
   ``It will make us a lot smarter,'' said Dr. Jeffrey M. Isner of
St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston.
   Isner's team has also used the probes to look inside the heart
while they fix defective heart valves. Eventually, he said, they
might also be used to check the movement of the heart's walls and
check it for clots.
   Among other studies presented at the meeting Wednesday:
   _ Doctors from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston said an
experimental test appears to spot the earliest stages of
cholesterol's damage to the blood vessels. They found that when
exposed to the nerve chemical acetylcholine, healthy blood vessels
expand, but if they are damaged, they contract. They hope to use
the test to spot early signs of trouble in heart transplant
recipients, who are at high risk for artery disease.
   _ Researchers from the Medical College of Wisconsin found that
in some cases, severely restricting salt in the diet may not be the
best advice. In a study of young men, they found that half had no
change or even a rise in their blood pressure while on a low-salt
diet. The heart association said that despite these preliminary
findings, it is sticking with its recommendation that people limit
their daily intake to one and a half teaspoons of salt.
   _ Doctors from the University of Oslo in Norway found that
people with large numbers of blood-clotting cells called platelets
are at unusually high risk of death from heart disease. They
followed 2,014 middle-aged men for 13 years and found that the 25
percent with the highest platelet counts had about double the death
rate of the other men.

   President Bush and House leaders agreed today
on a package of congressional pay raises and ethics reforms,
clearing the way for swift action before Congress adjourns next
week.
   ``I am very confident the president will make a statement later
today,'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters.
   The pay plan would bring House salaries from $89,500 to about
$120,700 in just over 13 months, and impose new ethics rules on the
amount and type of outside income members could earn.
   The House plan would apply to top officials government-wide,
except for the Senate, which was consiering a separate ethics and
pay package.
   The House would get a 7.9 percent raise by Jan. 1, as a
``cost-of-living adjustment'' for the two years since salaries were
last increased. A 25 percent raise would take effect a year later,
to coincide with the loss in income House members would suffer when
a prohibition takes effect on accepting fees for speeches before
interest groups.
   The bill also would tighten rules for other outside income and
gifts, require more disclosure of personal wealth and make other
ethics reforms.
   On Tuesday, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray told lawmakers
their plan failed to impose enough ethics restrictions on
legislative branch officials and their staffs, similar to those
governing the executive branch, according to sources who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., met with White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu today and settled the dispute, the
sources said.
   The pay increase itself was supported by the White House because
it also applied to federal judges and top officials in the
executive branch.
   House Democratic and Republican leaders had hoped to settle
their discussions with the White House by day's end Tuesday. They
were forced to postpone until Thursday party caucuses planned for
today as the first step in the final push.
   ``We want to make sure we can tell the caucus that we have an
understanding,'' said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., chairman of the
House Democratic Caucus.
   To demonstrate for rank-and-file members the bipartisan support
for the pay raise, Foley and Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., plan to appear before the House Republican Conference, and
their GOP counterparts, Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., and
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., were going before the
Democratic Caucus.
   Foley expressed confidence the House would approve the
pay-and-ethics plan. Senate sentiment remained uncertain, but Foley
said he had received ``very strong assurances'' from the leaders of
that chamber that it would not block the plan.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he
envisioned a different pay and ethics plan, one in which senators
would take only part of the pay raise and phase out speech
honoraria more slowly.
   But many House members expressed strong reservations about the
Senate, saying they feared the other chamber would stick the House
with the worst of all worlds _ a politically difficult vote
recorded in favor of a pay raise, and no pay raise.
   The new pay raise proposal is more modest than the 51 percent
raise with no ethics package that Congress rejected last winter in
response to a storm of public criticism.
   Instead of looking for ways to capitalize on the issue,
Republicans and Democrats lingered on the House floor discussing
arrangements for mutual political protection so they both could
vote for the pay raise.
   ``It's better than Monte Carlo out there,'' said one Democrat,
who insisted his name not be used.

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir took his
appeal against PLO participation in Mideast talks to President Bush
today after a two-hour session with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   Both Shamir and Baker claimed ``some progress'' toward arranging
talks between Israel and Palestinian Arabs.
   Shamir said the discussions would have to be continued. And
Baker stressed there was no reply yet from Egypt, which is acting
as the surrogate for the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   White House and State Department spokesmen said no deadline had
been imposed.
   ``It's important not to become impatient when you're dealing
with the Middle East,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said. ``Two thousand years is the normal wait for things to
happen.''
   As Shamir met with Baker, Fitzwater told reporters who asked if
Bush was frustrated: ``The peace process has been going on for a
number of years. You keep working at it, and keep plugging away.
You keep chipping away at it. You keep trying to make progress and
trying to move forward.''
   But, Fitzwater added: ``You have to fight frustration because
it's just not a fast process.''
   Shamir is appealing to Bush against a PLO role in the talks
being arranged between Israel and Palestinian Arabs. The Israeli
leader does not want to legitimize Yasser Arafat's organization,
which has conducted terrorist attacks against Israel, or be drawn
into negotiations over territory.
   Although Shamir's plan to visit Washington surfaced two months
ago the White House delayed until last week in arranging a meeting
with Bush. This was interpreted in some reports as evidence of
White House frustration with Shamir.
   The Israeli leader, on an 11-day trip to the United States and
Europe, wants to restrict the talks with Palestinian Arabs to
arrangements for limited self-rule on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   But the PLO has not given its approval for the talks, and Bush
and Baker might weigh giving iron-clad assurances to Israel against
risking PLO disapproval.
   It is generally assumed Palestinians would not negotiate with
Israel without a green light from the PLO, and the organization is
demanding a state carved out of territory held by Israel.
   Shamir, who arrived Monday, saw Baker over lunch at the State
Department today before calling on Bush. On Thursday, the prime
minister has scheduled meetings on Capitol Hill with members of the
House Foreign Affairs and the Senate Foreign Relations Committees.
   Egypt is acting as a surrogate for the PLO and has asked for
``clarifications'' of a plan by Baker to get Israel and
Palestinians together. The Israeli Cabinet, meanwhile, is seeking
assurances that the PLO and its members would play no role in the
talks.
   Baker telephoned Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid
Tuesday afternoon. The State Department declined to provide any
information about their conversation.
   In Cairo, Abdel-Meguid said Baker ``gave me the U.S. response to
the Palestinian request for clarifications and explanations that I
had relayed last Friday,'' He offered no details.
   The situation has grown complex, even by Middle Eastern
standards.
   Before the talks are held, Baker has proposed that he meet here
with Foreign Ministers Moshe Arens of Israel and Esmat Abdel Meguid
of Egypt.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said the
points raised by Israel and by Egypt for the PLO would have to be
ironed out before Baker held the Washington meeting.
   ``We've always said you have to have acceptance on a
framework,'' she said.
   Ms. Tutwiler did not seem frustrated by the absence of an
official response from Egypt to Baker's proposal for the
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   ``If at any point you get a positive reply, it's helpful,'' she
said. ``But there is no time frame on it.''
   Shamir was visited in his midtown hotel suite Tuesday by
officials from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a
lobbying and research group, and from the Conference of Presidents
of Major American Jewish Organizations.
   He also met with Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad and other Israeli
Embassy officials.
   Apart from some differences with the Bush administration, the
prime minister has been getting conflicting advice from American
Jews, who comprise the largest Jewish community in the world.
   Some are urging him to be conciliatory. Others are trying to
bolster Shamir's resolve not to make territorial and other
concessions before negotiations are held.
   Some 200 American rabbis signed a letter circulated by the
American Jewish Peace Lobby urging Shamir to accept the principle _
before any negotiations _ that Israel should relinquish land in
return for peace with the Arabs.
   ``Israel and its well-being are not only the concerns of the
inhabitants of that country, but touch the heart and religious
feeling of every Jew in the world,'' Rabbi Jerome Malino, of
Danbury, Conn., said in a statement. ``We should be prepared to
take the risk for peace we are so often prepared to take for war.''

<HEAD>Last-Chance Economic Reform Faces Resistance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's top economist
said Wednesday that reformers must push a radical, last-chance
decentralization plan on a Soviet public and parliament that may be
``waiting for a miracle.''
   Instead of taking the bitter medicine of higher prices, harder
work and temporary unemployment in the next few years, Soviets
expect ``those guys from UFOs will come down and explain
everything,'' said Deputy Premier Leonid I. Abalkin.
   If they fail to embrace the program, Soviets face widespread
rationing and the failure of reform, he said.
   Abalkin spoke at the end of a three-day conference of academics
and economic managers devoted to his plan of measured price
increases, dumping unprofitable state-run business, expanding forms
of ownership and developing a stock market.
   It is the most detailed plan produced in more than four years.
It spells out what interim steps the country must take to develop
more of a market economy and attain convertibility of the ruble.
   The conference reached a general consensus on the need for
change more radical than the government has tried so far, Abalkin
said, without giving details.
   The plan will be presented to the 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies when it holds its second session Dec. 12, and is
expected to serve as a blueprint for the government to measure
several key pieces of economic legislation, including one on varied
forms of property ownership.
   Abalkin said he expects resistance in the Congress, which
resembled a poorly organized debating society through much of its
first session six months ago. He said he was surprised by the mood
of the academicians and economists.
   ``The conservative mood was stronger than I thought before the
conference,'' he said.
   ``The powerful pressure was mostly exerted from the conservative
side,'' Abalkin said. ``Maybe that does reflect the general
condition of the country.''
   Most of the speeches from the conference have not been made
public, and Abalkin would not specify what objections were voiced.
   The economist said that after a summer of strikes by thousands
of coal miners and worsening shortages of many food items, the mood
of the public appears to have gotten more conservative.
   Opening the conference Monday, he cited poll data that indicated
54 percent of those questioned thought the country's most urgent
problem was to impose strict discipline and order. Another 40
percent thought that the government should impose more price
controls rather than gradually free up prices, as called for in his
plan.
   Abalkin vowed to fight to change public opinion and convince the
Congress of People's Deputies. In September, the economist was
subjected to a blistering attack in the Supreme Soviet legislature
by lawmakers who criticized the conduct of cooperatives, the small
private businesses allowed under Gorbachev's reforms that many
suspect of price gouging and racketeering.
   ``If there is a shift to the right, it will complicate
implementation of the program, but it won't make us go back,'' he
said.
   ``Without restructuring the Soviet economy has no future,'' he
added.
   Economists have rejected proposals to impose widespread
rationing, which is popular with some Soviets because it appeals to
the sense of equality drilled in over more than 70 years of Soviet
power.
   Abalkin said his plan gives local authorities the power to
impose rationing if they wish. But it rejects rationing as a
country-wide solution to shortages.
   He warned, however, that failure to adopt a radical reform will
lead to widespread rationing.
   ``If something stands in the way of its implementation and we
cannot stabilize the situation in the country, this system will
become unavoidable but it will mean an end to reform,'' he said.

<HEAD>Part-Time Soldier Injured in Letter Bomb Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A part-time soldier was injured
Wednesday when a letter bomb sent to his home near Belfast exploded
as he opened it, police said.
   The man, a member of the Territorial Army reserve force, escaped
serious injury but was being treated in hospital for his wounds and
for severe shock, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   The bomb was sent to the soldier's home in the Rathcoole area of
Newtownabbey on the northern outskirts of Belfast, police said. He
was not identified.
   Lt. Gen. Sir David Ramsbotham, 55, commander of the British
Field Army and inspector general of the Territorial Army, was
identified Tuesday as the target of a botched car bombing in London.
   No group claimed responsibility for either attack but suspicion
fell on the Irish Republican Army which is fighting to end British
rule in Northern Ireland and unite the mainly Protestant province
with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   Home Secretary David Waddington earlier Wednesday urged the
public to be alert for bombing campaigns following Monday's
discovery of a car bomb outside Ramsbotham's house in London's
fashionable Kensington district.
   Scotland Yard said the bomb, containing a plastic explosive, was
placed under the wrong car and fell off because it probably was not
attached properly. It was seen on the ground by a painter working
nearby who called police.
   The car bomb bore the hallmarks of the IRA, police said.
   ``I do not think the IRA are respecters of our religions,''
Waddington said in a BBC radio interview. ``I think there is just
as much likelihood of there being a dastardly campaign at Christmas
as any other time of the year.''
   Also Wednesday, the Belfast to Dublin railway line reopened
after troops searched the track near Lurgan, County Armagh,
following a bomb warning. The security forces said nothing was
found.
   Train service between the two cities has been disrupted more
than 60 times this year because of bombs and bomb hoaxes, blamed on
the IRA.

<TEXT>
   The Bucknell University faculty says
sororities and fraternaties are racist, sexist and
anti-intellectual and has recommended abolishing them on campus.
   The recommendation, adopted 94-46 Monday night, goes before the
board of trustees in May.
   The faculty vote came on a motion by George Jenks, a librarian,
who said the organizations have not made any improvements since
1985, when he also recommended their abolition.
   His 1985 motion before the faculty was amended to merely
recommend improving the organizations.
   University President Gary A. Sojka said the trustees will have a
wealth of material to consider before their May meeting. The issue
has generated an enormous amount of mail from students, faculty and
alumni, he said.
   Bucknell has 13 fraternities and 10 sororities. Fraternities are
permitted to have houses, while sororities are not.

<TEXT>
   Matchmakers think the timing is right to
introduce a widower to a partially blind potential mate.
   Syracuse's Burnet Park Zoo plans to introduce its recently
widowed bald eagle to a bird from Florida, according to Ken
Reininger, curator of birds at the zoo. The Florida bird was
captured by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service after it lost an eye
to a shotgun pellet.
   ``We do expect to have her before the weather gets cold,'' he
said. ``It's a perfect time of year to try this type of thing.''
   The zoo's previous female bald eagle died of a heart attack in
May during a crucial egg-tending period. The male eagle tended the
eggs and took over the parental responsibilities. The only
surviving chick was removed later that month and given to wild
foster parents.
   Reininger said the male eagle hasn't been lonely since the death
of his mate and the departure of his chick.
   ``(Loneliness) doesn't make much sense evolution-wise,'' he
said. ``He just continued on with his life. He's just not that
shortsighted.''

   Poles expressed pride and satisfaction at
Lech Walesa's speech Wednesday to a joint session of Congress,
which was carried live nationwide on Polish TV and radio.
   ``I was really very nervous about him, but he was very good. I
am very happy,'' said Walesa's wife, Danuta, speaking from their
home in Gdansk where she watched the speech with some of their
eight children.
   ``I never dreamed Lech would address the Congress, but I never
dreamed about lots of other things that have already happened and
things are now happening so fast. I hope everything will be better
now and it will be even faster,'' she said by telephone.
   Mrs. Walesa said that she had spoken with her husband earlier in
the day. ``He said he would have a difficult day today. But I am
satisfied with him,'' she said.
   Mrs. Walesa had visited the United States in July to represent
her husband at a ceremony in Philadelphia where he was awarded the
first Philadelphia Liberty Medal.
   It has been a year of triumph for the electrican who helped
found the independent Solidarity trade union in Gdansk nearly nine
years ago and guided it through the difficult years after it was
crushed during the 1981 martial-law crackdown and later banned.
   Solidarity was legalized for the second time in April, and
candidates backed by the movement scored a landslide victory in
partially democratic legislative elections in June.
   Walesa then engineered the parliamentary coalition that led to
the election of his close adviser, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, as the head
of the first non-Communist government in the East bloc.
   The Citizens Parliamentary Club, as the Solidarity group of
deputies and senators is called, watched the speech in the main
chamber of the Polish legislature.
   Elsewhere, hundreds of people gathered around TV sets in
Warsaw's main train station to watch the speech.
   ``I think he expressed what many Poles could have expressed. It
was the right thing to do and it was a pleasure to listen to him,''
said a police officer who declined to give his name.
   ``It was very good. You cannot add to anything he said because
he said everything there was to be said,'' said a construction
worker. He said the reaction of the Congress was very positive and
hoped the Americans would help Poland as much as possible.
   Another viewer also was impressed.
   ``It was good. We have to do something with the Reds
(Communists),'' said a young man from Czechoslovakia who stayed in
Poland after attending an independent cultural symposium last week
in the southwestern city of Wroclaw.
   The evening TV news later carried excerpts of the speech.

   Battling the bulge while in the public eye hasn't
been easy, talk-show queen Oprah Winfrey said Wednesday,
acknowledging she has regained 17 of the celebrated 67 pounds she
lost last year.
   ``You order a side dish and they call 911 on you,'' she told her
television audience.
   Then there was the time Winfrey ordered apple pancakes in a
restaurant and ``read about it in two newspapers the next day.''
   Winfrey, who has not revealed either her ``before'' or ``after''
weight, shed her pounds with a liquid protein diet. Exactly a year
ago, she showed off a new, svelte self in tight-fitting jeans as
her national audience applauded.
   Her luck with losing was national news and in August, Winfrey's
face _ superimposed on actress Ann-Margret's hourglass figure _
graced the cover of TV Guide.
   But on Wednesday, Winfrey, 35, commiserated over the
difficulties of dieting with a studio audience loaded with folks on
their way up or down the scale.
   ``Nothing would have pleased me more than to walk off into the
sunset in my size 10 Calvin Klein jeans,'' she said. ``I said it
was going to be a struggle and Lord knows, it has.''
   Winfrey said she's managed to keep most of the weight off by
exercise and a diet low in fat and sugar.
   But she admitted to some mean encounters with sweet-potato pie.
   ``I have eaten four bowls of Raisin Bran trying not to eat a
piece of cake,'' Winfrey said. ``I still am struggling with ... why
I have a weight problem.''
   Winfrey made a final plea: ``If you see me out someplace and I
am ordering pancakes _ just let me do it.''

   Police began registering residents' semiautomatic
assault weapons under a new city ordinance today, with opponents
threatening a court fight.
   Lawyer Duncan Cameron was the only person to register a weapon
in the first hour.
   ``I don't like registering my possessions, but the law requires
it,'' said the former chief Denver district attorney. ``I feel more
secure at night owning one of these.''
   Police have received hundreds of calls from gun owners seeking
information on the law. Owners have 60 days to register their guns.
   The ordinance was introduced in the wake of growing gang
activity in the city and mass killings around the nation by gunmen
using such weapons. Denver's sensitivity to the issue was
heightened earlier this year when a man with a submachine gun
killed two people and wounded three in suburban Littleton.
   Police checked the serial number on Cameron's AK-47 lookalike
rifle and ran a background check on him. He then paid his $30
license fee and left.
   Lt. Gary Walter, commander of the department's firearms bureau,
said he could not estimate how many guns would be registered.
``Maybe I'm optimistic, but I think the majority of the people are
going to comply,'' he said. ``If the majority of the people comply,
I think it will have an effect.''
   But Cameron, 48, said he suspected many gun owners won't
register their weapons for fear the City Council will declare them
illegal in the future. The ordinance specifically bans the sale of
more than 30 models of semiautomatic assault weapons. Federal law
controls ownership of fully automatic weapons.
   Failure to register a weapon already owned _ or possession of a
registered weapon with a magazine having more than 20 rounds _ can
bring fines of $100 to $999 and jail terms of 10 days to six
months. The weapon would be destroyed upon conviction.
   A similar bill was defeated in the last session of the
Legislature.
   Gun owners turned out in force to lobby against the ordinance:
297 people signed up to speak against it at a hearing; only 30
asked to speak in support. The City Council passed the ordinance
Nov. 6 on a 9-4 vote.
   The Firearms Coalition of Colorado announced it will file a
lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance.
   George Nyfeler, National Riflemen Association's field
representative for Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, said his major
complaint with the ordinance is that it leaves too much
``subjective interpretation'' of what constitutes an assault
weapon. He said it also gives police ``unrestrained authority.''
   ``It scares the hell out of me and should scare the hell out of
every citizen in Denver,'' Nyfeler said Tuesday.
   Not so, said ordinance author and Councilwoman Cathy Reynolds.
   ``I am hopeful a majority of people in Denver who currently own
these weapons will understand the wisdom of getting these guns
registered,'' Reynolds said.
   ``It is a very strong conviction of mine that these weapons have
no place in our community. They are built as anti-personnel assault
weapons. We don't need them in an urban environment,'' she said.
``I'm convinced it is a technically good bill and can be enforced
properly.''
   The ordinance specifies 23 models of rifles, seven of pistols
and three of shotguns and their variations. It excludes most
semiautomatic sporting firearms.
   After the Littleton shootings in March, Reynolds introduced a
resolution declaring the council's intention to pass a law
restricting or prohibiting the sale of semiautomatic weapons.

fog.
   The heir to the British throne had been due to rejoin his wife,
Princess Diana, in London on Monday night after flying back from
Hong Kong at the end of a Far East tour. But thick fog at both
London and Birmingham airports forced the prince's jet to head
north for an unscheduled stopover at Glasgow.
   After an unsuccessful attempt to take off again, Charles and his
party checked into Glasgow Airport's Excelsior Hotel where he had
birthday breakfast on Tuesday.
   The Prince was presented with a birthday card from hotel staff
before he flew on to London to celebrate the rest of his birthday.
   ``He kept himself to himself and there was very little fuss,''
said hotel general manager Alan Hunter.

   Actor Todd Bridges will be retried on a
felony assault charge stemming from a shooting at a drug den. He
was acquitted of attempted murder and attempted voluntary
manslaughter in the shooting.
   In acquitting Bridges on two charges on Nov. 11, jurors said
they were deadlocked on the assault charge. The District Attorney's
Office on Tuesday announced its plans for another trial on the
assault charge.
   Bridges, 24, testified he had been on a four-day cocaine binge
and couldn't remember shooting anyone at the crack house Feb. 2.
Convicted drug dealer Kenneth ``Tex'' Clay, 25, survived the attack
and testified Bridges was ``based out'' from freebasing or smoking
cocaine when the shooting occurred.
   Bridges, who for eight years played actor Gary Coleman's brother
Willis on the TV series ``Diff'rent strokes, testified he became
depressed and turned to drugs after the situation comedy was
canceled in 1986.
   Bridges, who had been held in lieu of $1 million bail since his
February arrest, was freed last week on $25,000 bail.

   Country music singer James Talley, who

selling homes is his priority now but there's still satisfaction
from his music.
   In the 1970s, he released socially conscious country music like
``Are They Gonna Make Us Outlaws Again.'' First lady Rosalyn Carter
said at the time he was her favorite singer.
   Talley, 47, said in a recent interview that he tired of the
music business this decade and decided selling real estate would be
an appealing career. His sales have totaled at least $1 million
during each of the five years he has spent in his new occupation.
   ``Real estate is my life now, but the music makes the life worth
living,'' he said. He still sings some and has just released a new
album and had his four old ones re-issued.

<HEAD>Beijing Warns Against Propaganda By Fax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Beijing government has ordered offices to
intercept and hand over to authorities the ``reactionary
propaganda'' being sent by fax machines from Chinese dissidents
abroad, an official report said.
   The report indicates that fax machines are being widely used to
send into China accounts of the military crushing of the
pro-democracy movement and of the subsequent crackdown on dissent
that contradict government accounts.
   Millions of Chinese supported the movement for freedom before
troops shot their way into Beijing on June 3-4 to break up the
demonstrations, killing hundreds if not thousands of unarmed
civilians.
   The government has called the pro-democracy demonstrations a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' and says the army heroically
restored order to the Chinese capital.
   Dissidents who fled to France ``have repeatedly used faxes and
other communication tools to spread a large quantity of reactionary
propaganda in our city,'' according to the news service.
   It did not further describe the material being sent into Beijing.
   The government order demanded that city offices, companies and
universities prevent the information coming over faxes from
spreading throughout the population, the official China News
Service said.
   Under the new order, every work unit with a fax must appoint a
person to carefully monitor the machine. ``Reactionary propaganda''
must be intercepted, sealed, and handed over to public security
officials.
   The order also stresses the need to explain to expatriate
businessmen and other foreigners in Beijing that disseminating
propaganda against the Communist Party and government is illegal
and unfriendly.
   Fax machines in Beijing can be found in hotels, joint ventures
and companies that do business overesas. They also have begun to
appear in some government offices and academic centers, but there
are no official figures on the number of machines in the city.
   During the spring demonstrations and subsequent crackdown,
overseas Chinese used faxes to provide Chinese outside Beijing with
accounts of events in the capital that were not reported in the
official press or distorted by government propaganda.
   The Foreign Ministry on Oct. 31 accused the French magazine
Actuel of an ``undisguised act of subversion against China'' for
sending by fax imitation copies of the People's Daily written by
Yan Jiaqi and other dissidents living in Paris.
   The ministry accused the French government of ``conniving at and
supporting this hostile act against China in total disregard of the
representations made by the Chinese side.''

   As a boy, Michael Dukakis enjoyed sports books
starring a fellow called ``the Duke'' and young Mario Cuomo learned
the virtues of family from ``Swiss Family Robinson.''
   Two girls named Kay Orr and Rose Mofford read ``Little Women.''
   Those are some of the results of a survey asking the nation's
governors to name their favorite childhood books. The survey,
conducted by Pizza Hut Inc., was to help mark National Young
Reader's Day on Wednesday.
   The most oft-cited gubernatorial favorites were by Mark Twain:
``Tom Sawyer,'' named by 10 governors, and ``Huckleberry Finn,''
cited by a dozen.
   Among others listed by more than one governor were ``Treasure
Island,'' the Dr. Seuss books, ``Black Beauty,'' ``Charlotte's
Web,'' and ``The Red Badge of Courage.''
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard recalled ``Paddle to the Sea'' by
Holling C. Holling, about an Indian boy who built a canoe and
paddled from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. ``I can still
remember feeling like I was part of the trip,'' he said.

<HEAD>Polowetzky Named Chief Editor of AP Newsfeatures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nate Polowetzky, a veteran executive in national
and international news operations of The Associated Press, on
Wednesday was named chief editor of AP Newsfeatures, the company's
weekend feature service.
   For the past 16 years, Polowetzky has been the AP's foreign
editor, responsible for foreign news operations around the world.
He was given the additional title of assistant general manager in
1977.
   Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager of the news
cooperative, said Polowetzky had been a major force in the field of
international reporting for many of his 45 years with the company.
   ``Nate's broad background and understanding of world events have
brought depth to the AP's international news coverage,'' Boccardi
said. ``I have asked him to return to directing AP Newsfeatures
because I know he will bring to that special part of our service
the same creativity and breadth of vision.''
   Boccardi said the appointment would be effective Jan. 1.
   As supervising editor of AP Newsfeatures, a post he previously
held from 1964 to 1969, Polowetzky will be responsible for that
department's in-depth interpretive and other feature productions
that move on the national wires primarily for Sunday use.
   He succeeds Rene J. Cappon, 65, who has been given a new
assignment to conduct a company-wide campaign on writing and
editing for the AP news staff. Polowetzky's successor as foreign
editor will be announced later.
   Polowetzky, 68, was born and grew up in Harrison, N.J., and is a
journalism graduate of Rutgers University. He joined the AP in New
York in 1944, after working for the Newark Star-Ledger and The
Jersey Journal. He spent 12 years as a foreign correspondent in
London, Prague, Cairo, Tehran, Korea and Tokyo.
   He returned to New York from abroad in 1961, and held posts as
assistant business news editor, business news editor, assistant
general news editor, supervising editor of AP Newsfeatures and
enterprise editor before being named to his present position.

<HEAD>Frank Langella Stars in `Tempest'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York theatergoers have seen so many
established actors jump into Shakespeare and fall flat that failure
has become the expectation.
   Therefore it is with unusual appreciation that one finds Frank
Langella in ``The Tempest'' playing Prospero with poetry,
rich-voiced grandeur and the wisdom accumulated and tempered by a
sensitive elder statesman.
   ``The Tempest'' opened Tuesday night at the off-Broadway
Roundabout Theater.
   Langella doesn't carry the play by himself. B.D. Wong, in his
next assignment after Broadway's ``M. Butterfly,'' is the spirit
Ariel. Wong, wearing only black Bermuda shorts on his thin frame,
looks the epitomy of an other-world sprite.
   Wong's Ariel adores Prospero and trusts that Prospero will keep
his promise to set him free.
   Langella's Prospero who, in the last scene, forgives his
enemies, is neither an overbearing father nor a bookish recluse. At
the beginning, he talks about his books but acts like a man who has
already digested their contents and now is a person of informed
action.
   He loves his daughter, Miranda, and hates to give her up. He
makes it clear, though, that he is putting obstacles in her
relationship with her swain so their path to happiness won't be so
easy that they fail to appreciate it.
   Angela Sherrill has such an unclouded brow and innocent aspect
that she looks younger, not older, than Miranda's 15. Miranda and
Ferdinand, son of the King of Naples, fall in love at first sight.
John Wittenbauer as Ferdinand seems weak at first, then his voice,
as sweet as a young tenor's, grows on one. Prospero has caused the
tempest that shipwrecked on his island the King of Naples (a hearty
Jack Ryland), Prospero's brother who stole the Dukedom of Milan
from him (Rocco Sisto), the King's brother who plans the same
maneuver (Gabriel Barre), Gonzalo, who saved Prospero's life (an
avuncular Robert Stattel) and another lord (Erik Knutsen).
   Also washed ashore are the jester (Michael Countryman) and
butler (Michaeljohn McGann) who play the low comedy scenes with
Caliban. Jay Patterson is good as Caliban, who has a real grievance
against Prospero but whose personality is so loathsome that he
forfeits sympathy.
   Jude Kelly, artistic director of the West Yorkshire Playhouse in
England, made her New York directing debut.
   Franco Colavecchia designed the set of Prospero's abode, with
additional playing space on the roof. Lindsay W. Davis designed
costumes, with loose underwear and a burlap cape for Prospero, a
white nightgown for Miranda and contrasting elaborate garb and wigs
for the court.

   Ringo Starr won a permanent court order Wednesday
blocking the release of a 1987 album he says was made in an alcohol
haze, then testified that he never agreed to pay the producer's
studio costs.
   The former Beatle, who sued producer Chips Moman and College
Park, Ga.-based CRS Records to prevent the release of the album,
was the first witness as the trial on the rest of the issues began
Wednesday in Fulton County Superior Court.
   Starr said he went to Memphis in February 1987 to work with
Moman and his part of the agreement was to do the recording
sessions and pay for his plane fare and living expenses. Moman was
to provide the studio and produce the recordings.
   There was no formal contract, Starr said. Moman contends that
Starr owes him $146,239 for studio costs and out-of-pocket expenses.
   ``I felt some (contractual) agreement would be reached but it
always hinged on if the album was a success,'' Starr testified. ``I
had no understanding that any studio time would be billed to me.''
   Starr, who has said in court documents that he was under the
influence of alcohol during the recording sessions, said after
returning home to England and listening to the tapes he decided
they needed more work.
   Starr sings on the recordings, but did not play drums. Before he
would approve the album, he wanted to overdub his own drumming.
   Judge Clarence Cooper did not elaborate on his ruling Wednesday
to make permanent the temporary injunction against release of the
album. But court personnel said pre-trial evidence indicated that
Starr all along had the right to block the record _ under certain
conditions.
   Moman's attorneys have said Starr came to the producer in an
attempt to revive his waning music career. Though acknowledging he
had not had a hit record in several years, Starr testified he was
not desperate when he first talked with Moman.
   ``It was just a move for your career,'' he said. ``I wasn't
looking for Chips and Chips probably wasn't looking for me.''
   Starr embarked on a successful U.S. concert tour during the
summer, but according to testimony Wednesday, he refused a request
by Moman to include songs from the Memphis sessions in his live
shows.
   Starr's appearance drew several courthouse employees for a look
at Starr and his wife, actress Barbara Bach. After getting some
laughs by asking, ``Is it on?'' as he approached the witness stand
microphone, Starr was serious during most of his testimony.
   He appeared annoyed with some questions as his testimomy
extended more than an hour, asking the judge at one point: ``Can I
speak plainly? This `yes' and `no' is impossible for me.''

<HEAD>State Department Says Soviets Shipping Advanced Jet Fighters to Cuba</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Wednesday that the
Soviet Union has shipped advanced MiG-29 aircraft to Cuba, a move
it called ``wholly inconsistent'' with Moscow's stated desire to
promote peace in Central America.
   ``We see no legitimate Cuban need for such advanced aircraft,
and we do not consider this a helpful step,' said Richard Boucher,
the department's spokesman, who confirmed a report in The
Washington Times.
   Citing a need to protect intelligence data, Boucher refused to
provide details on when the aircraft arrived in Cuba, how many
planes had been shipped and whether Moscow also provided trainers.
   But the Times said one high-tech combat aircraft _ believed to
be the first of a squadron _ was discovered in Cuba late last
month. The MiG-29 was first photographed in crates by a U.S.
intelligence satellite after delivery to a Cuban port, the paper
said. It was identified as a MiG-29 after assembly.
   ``We find the action wholly inconsistent with the Soviet Union's
professed desire to cooperate in promoting the peaceful settlement
of disputes in the region,'' Boucher said, adding that Cuba is
under no threat from the United States.
   ``We are making our concerns known to the Soviets,'' he said.
   Boucher said Secretary of State James A. Baker III knew about
the MiG-29 aircraft earlier in the week, when he criticized the
Soviets for continuing to support ``violence, destruction and war''
in Central America by shipping weapons and money through Cuba and
Nicaragua.
   ``Soviet behavior toward Cuba and Central America remains the
biggest obstacle'' to improving relations between the superpowers,
he said in a speech.
   On Tuesday, President Bush charged that Cuba and Nicaragua,
Moscow's clients in the region, have ``aided and abetted'' the
leftist rebels in El Salvador, who have mounted bloody attacks in
that country this week. Baker said the rebels are using Soviet
rocket-propelled grenades.
   Bush said he would call on Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to shut down the pipeline of weapons into the region when the two
leaders meet Dec. 2-3 on ships in the Mediterrean.
   ``I hope maybe we can have some action from him that will help
the democracies in this hemisphere,'' Bush said. ``This will be
very much on my mind.''

   About 200 East Germans, bolstered by democratic
advances in their own country, demonstrated Wednesday outside the
Romanian Embassy to denounce the Bucharest leadership as Stalinist
and repressive.
   The demonstration was called by supporters of exiled Romanian
writers to put pressure on Nicolae Ceausescu, the most hard-line
leader Eastern Europe.
   Only two months ago, East Germans themselves faced brutal
crackdowns by police for taking part in unauthorized protests. But
the nation has been swept up in a storm of reforms and democratic
changes since Oct. 18, when Egon Krenz was named to succeed his
ousted mentor, Erich Honecker, as Communist Party leader in East
Germany.
   Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have been marching weekly
through Leipzig in demand of further reform, including free
elections.
   In the anti-Ceausescu rally, the group marched from the
Gethsemane Church to the Romanian Embassy, hoisting placards
reading ``Down with Stalinism.''

   Would you buy a single cheese, large fries
and a Frosty from Melinda's?
   In 1969, R. David Thomas, founder of Wendy's International Inc.,
proudly named his downtown Columbus restaurant after his daughter,
Melinda.
   ``My brother and sisters couldn't pronounce Melinda, they called
me Wenda,'' said Wendy (or is it Melinda?) Thomas in an interview
prior to joining her father in the restaurant's 20th anniversary
celebration Wednesday.
   ``I don't even respond to Melinda. When people say it, I say
`WHO are you talking to?'''
   Thomas, Mayor Dana Rinehart and other Wendy's officials joined
store employees flipping burgers behind the counter of the original
Wendy's after a brief ceremony during which Rinehart proclaimed
Wednesday as Wendy's Day.
   Ms. Thomas, now 28, not only goes by the name Wendy, but swears
she still eats at Wendy's ``every chance I can.'' A single with
cheese, ketchup, tomato and lettuce is her favorite.
   She said growing up as the namesake for a business that has
sales of $3 billion a year had its ups and downs.
   ``It wasn't an ego thing. I just thought it was neat because Dad
would bring home hamburgers and thick chocolate milk shakes and we
didn't have to eat green beans,'' she said.
   She felt uncomfortable at times during her years at high school
and the University of Florida when she was introduced as Wendy of
Wendy's.
   ``I was extremely protective of myself,'' she said. ``I could
tell if I was being used. I was very selective _ too selective. Now
I hear about the dates I had and I wish it were true with some of
them. I wish I'd had of half the dates I hear about.''
   At college in Gainesville, Fla., she said: ``When people found
out who I was, they felt like I was this rich kid who had the world
in my hands. But I had a budget, a lot of times I was broke and
drank the cheapest beer I could find.''
   Ms. Thomas said she now works with her husband, Paul, the
manager of a Columbia, S.C., country club. She said she never
worked in a Wendy's store but as a teen-ager helped out at the
Wendy's at the state fair and worked a summer at the corporate
offices in suburban Dublin.
   She indicated no desire to return to the family business,
saying, ``I don't want to make other people uncomfortable because
I'm Dave Thomas' daughter.''
   She recalled her first Wendy's job at age 8 as ``really itchy.''
   ``We went downtown to a studio photographer and stuck my hair up
in braids and stuck pipe cleaners in it and it was real hard to sit
still,'' she said, recalling the photo session that led to the
Wendy's logo.
   Ms. Thomas said people in her new home are starting to learn who
she is and complain to her if the local Wendy's gets an order wrong.
   ``I ask them to please tell the manager. They'll fix it. These
people think I run every store.''

   Chinese authorities admitted Wednesday that
soldiers fired their guns near Japanese golfers last weekend but
said it was an accident unrelated to a death threat received by
Toyota officials.
   Officials of the Public Security Ministry told Japanese
diplomats their investigation showed a few soldiers were
``testing'' their guns at a shooting range south of the Beijing
Golf Club on Sunday, Japanese sources in Beijing said.
   The security officials said some bullets strayed onto the course
near the ninth and 18th holes, according to the sources, who would
not be further identified.
   Several Japanese golfers reported hearing two bursts of machine
gun fire and bullets whizzing by shortly before noon Sunday. They
included three employees of Toyota Motor Corp., whose Beijing
office on Nov. 9 received a letter containing a bullet and note
threatening to kill Japanese in China.
   The security officials were quoted as telling the Japanese
diplomats that while the Chinese side took the shooting incident
seriously, it was unrelated to the death threat.
   Chinese authorities instructed related units to take measures
``to eliminate the uneasiness,'' but did not apologize for the
incident, the sources said.
   Toyota, which had considered withdrawing its staff from China
following the letter and shooting incident, decided to keep them in
place, Toyota spokesman Andy Pfeiffenberger said in Tokyo.
   ``We decided the situation didn't call for them to be taken back
to Tokyo,'' Pfeiffenberger said. ``We told them to be careful, to
be alert to things there, but things are back to normal and work is
going on as usual.''
   Toyota has seven employees in Beijing and six in Canton
(Guangzhou), Pfeiffenberger said.
   He would not say if the note was signed or disclose its
contents, but the sources in Beijing said it read, ``Now that the
martial law troops have gone, our time has come. Go back to Japan.
From now, we will kill Japanese.''
   Soldiers called in under martial law were stationed at major
intersections and overpasses in Beijing after the June 3-4 military
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement of this spring.
   The last troops were removed Nov. 1, and only a few armed police
remain at Tiananmen Square, the focal point of the protests.
   In July and August, a group calling itself the ``Blood-Bright
Dare to Die Squad'' sent letters to several Japanese firms
threatening to kill Japanese in retaliation for Japan's ``economic
invasion'' of China.
   Japan's trade surplus with China was $3.1 billion last year,
according to Chinese figures, but Japanese figures say the surplus
was $383 million in China's favor.

   Customs Service radar planes, which have
experienced problems with their sophisticated computer systems, had
mechanical failures this week that almost ruined a demonstration
for the agency's new commissioner and the federal drug policy
director.
   Normally, the two Lockheed P-3 airborne early warning aircraft
use their high-tech radar to locate drug-ferrying airplanes. But
last Monday, the mission was different.
   One of the planes was assigned to fly the new Customs Service
commissioner, Carol Hallett, and William Bennett _ director of the
Office of National Drug Control Strategy _ from Savannah, Ga., to
Tampa, Fla., for a conference.
   On the way, Customs Service officials were to demonstrate the
computerized radar system designed especially for detection of
drug-smuggling aircraft.
   According to an account by Customs Service spokesman David
Hoover, the difficulties began Sunday night when one of the two
aircraft left its base in Corpus Christi, Texas, on a regular
surveillance mission. That plane experienced a failure in the radar
system and returned home.
   Monday morning, Customs launched its other P-3 to pick up the
officials, but a fluid pump in the cooling system failed in flight.
The system pumps vital coolant to the radar components, which
cannot be allowed to overheat.
   The plane bound for Savannah made an unscheduled landing in New
Orleans in an effort to fix the problem. But to get the part,
Customs officials had to fly the plane that was grounded Sunday
night to New Orleans, so the defective part could be switched.
   The cooling system in the Savannah-bound plane was fixed, but
when the radar was turned on, a spark knocked out the components
that let the radar run on high power.
   So when Bennett and Mrs. Hallett got their tour, the radar was
on low power, meaning that it's range was reduced from about 250
miles to 80 miles.
   ``It was picking up a multitude of targets,'' Hoover said.
``There was no perceptible difference in the way the radar works
between high and low power.''
   Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton said Bennett ``knew there was
some concern about the radar. But he had a great trip. He enjoyed
it. He learned a lot of useful information.''

   Plymouth Rock is on its way to becoming
whole again and the mason who is doing the repair work for $1 says
he'll have the Pilgrim's historic landing spot back in shape for
Thanksgiving.
   ``I don't look at it as a job, I look at it as a privilege to
preserve something that means a lot to people all over the United
States,'' said mason Paul Choquette, 42, of South Dartmouth.
   Choquette was hired to fix the rock's crack by the state
Department of Environmental Management after it put out bids for
the work. Since monetary payment is required, he bid $1. The work
should take one day, he said Tuesday.
   The rock, which weighs about six tons and measures about 14 feet
wide and 6 feet long, is said to be the spot where the Pilgrims
first set foot on ground when they arrived from England in 1620.
   The crack, which first appeared in the 1770s, was repaired in
the late 19th century. For 100 years, that patch-up job has stood
up to the tides that occasionally submerge the rock, which stands
in a half-enclosed protective structure in the waters off this
seaside town.
   The original mortar used by that mason is deteriorating,
however. Town and state officials said they fear that when water
seeps into the rock it will freeze and cause the crack to worsen.
   ``It could happen soon, it could happen in 10 years,'' said
Peter O'Neil, a DEM spokesman.
   ``We want to be cautious,'' he said. ``It would look terribly
embarrassing if it split in half.''
   Choquette said he would also fix a series of hairline cracks
that have developed within the main fracture and in some other
areas of the rock. The smaller cracks were caused by the vibrations
of the tourist buses that rumble over the road about five feet from
the landmark, he said.
   Choquette said he feels lucky to get the job.
   ``It just makes me feel good,'' he said. ``It's just knowing
what it stands for. It's a symbol of freedom and how America
supposedly started off.''
   The mason has been instructed not to use high-tech glues or
epoxy because scientists want to be able to undo his work without
damaging the rock if more substantial repairs become necessary.
   Choquette said he will use a special mortar mixed to match the
color and consistency of the 19th century repairs, but he declined
to reveal his recipe, beyond ``small pebbles.''
   The rock will never be the same boulder the Pilgrim landing
party saw, however. The crack originated when the Sons of Liberty
attempted to move the rock to the town square and dropped it,
breaking the rock in two.
   They initially used the smaller piece for their town display,
but when tourists kept chipping away at the rock, they decided to
glue it back to its partner in 1880 and put it back in the water.

   A Democratic congressman concerned about
continued federal support for the arts said Wednesday that
conservatives are stirring up controversy over a few questionable
art projects to kill the National Endowment for the Arts.
   ``The right is using Mapplethorpe as their new Willie Horton,''
said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., during a hearing of his Education
and Labor subcommittee on postsecondary education.
   Willie Horton, a convicted rapist who committed more crimes
after failing to return from a prison furlough in Massachusetts,
was used as an issue in last year's presidntial campaign against
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Congress banned federal financing of ``obscene'' art and reduced
its $171 million appropriation for the NEA by $45,000 this year
after learning that federal funds had helped support two artists,
Andres Serrano and Robert Mapplethorpe, whose work was considered
obscene.
   That effort was led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Williams, whose subcommittee is considering legislation to keep
the endowment operating, said, ``Those who want to see NEA unfunded
are utilizing the unwillingness of Congress to explain Serrano to
get their way.''
   He said members of Congress would find it easier to take action
against the NEA than engage in complicated discussions with their
constituents about the value of aid that sometimes supports
questionable taste.
   ``The endowment has given out 85,000 grants and run into
controversy on 20 of them,'' said Leonard Garment, an attorney who
helped establish the NEA.
   He said that NEA ``officials and panels have behaved overall
with an admirable sense of responsibility.''
   Bruce Fein, an attorney who opposes federal support of art,
argued, ``There is no First Amendment right to be subsidized by the
government.''
   ``Creative art does not need government subsidies to flourish,''
he said.
   But Williams, Garment and attorney Floyd Abrams said government
aid attract private donors and government refusal to fund art would
lead them away.
   ``There is a real problem that if corporate America begins to
think of the arts as tainted, the easy way out is to find something
else.''

   Ten-year-old Hillary Schaefer guarantees
that if President Bush listens to her advice, the number of fish he
catches ``will shoot up like a rocket.''
   The fourth-grader was selected from 5,400 write-in essay
entrants to appear on a national public television program for
students, ``What's In The News,'' to relate advice she would give
the president.
   Hillary's essay was inspired by Bush's lack of fishing success
during a vacation at his home in Maine. She donned a fishing hat,
grabbed a pole and clutched a fishing net while she read her essay
during a videotaping session at a local television station Tuesday.
   ``President Bush can't catch fish,'' her essay began. ``Well,
I'll teach him. I'll guarantee that if President Bush listens to
me, the number of fish he catches will shoot up like a rocket.''
   Bush needs to ``keep those Secret Service guys out of your
way,'' her essay said. He should go walleye fishing and use two
baits _ throw crayfish in the lake to attract fish and worms on a
hook to catch them.
   Bush also should make sure his pole is twice the length of his
arm, Hillary advised.
   And if he does catch a fish, ``put it in a bucket. It would be a
good idea to put water in the bucket you're using,'' the essay
concluded.

   Garbark, 40, of the Pittsburgh suburb of Brentwood, estimates
he's won about 300 prizes and entered about 5,000 contests in the

   Garbark, a marketing executive with WAMO radio, enters up to 50

have short life spans. His wife and three children often help fill
out entries.
   ``I think I'm violating some child labor laws,'' he said. ``I

   Montana's hunters and ranchers will be free to
kill bison that stray from northern Yellowstone National Park this
winter and as many as 200 of the animals might be killed, the
state's wildlife director said today.
   Last year more than 500 Yellowstone bison were killed in Montana
after they roamed from the park. That was an unprecedented number
and prompted outcries from some environmentalists and
conservationists.
   K.L. Cool, Montana's director of fish and game, said the state
and officials of the National Park Service have agreed that the
northern bison herd at Yelowstone should be limited to about 200 to
300 animals, so they can be better managed.
   Cool and Bob Barbee, superintendent of the park, briefed some
congressmen as well as environmental and conservation leaders, on
the bison management plan. But Barbee told reporters he still
hasn't determined how the herd will be reduced from the current
roughly 400 animals, or how the bison will be kept from roaming
onto Montana rangeland this winter.
   ``On the long haul, trying to herd a buffalo doesn't work.
Buffalo are herded where they want to go,'' said Barbee, adding
that efforts will be made to keep the bison in the park by ``gentle
hazing'' and whatever else might work.
   But Cool said the state will maintain its policy of shooting any
bison that cross into Montana until the northern Yellowstone herd
is reduced to about 200 animals.
   ``Montana does not want to be viewed as being unrealistic or
uncooperative,'' he said. But he said the state legislature has
required that hunters be free to shoot the bison that roam into the
state.
   Ranchers have complained vigorously that the buffalo cause
damage to property and they fear the animals will transmit
brucellosis _ a disease the interferes with reproduction _ to their
cattle. Blood tests have shown that more than half of the bison
killed in Montana last year had brucellosis, he said.
   Under the Montana plan, bison will be shot in warden-supervised
hunts this winter and spring if they leave the park.
   Yellowstone has about 2,500 bison in three major herds on its
more than 2.4 million acres. But only the northern, or Lamar, herd,
poses a concern to Montana ranchers. Because of a series of mild
winters and other factors, the northern bison herd grew to more
than 900 last year and most of them roamed along the Yellowstone
River Valley into Montana where 569 of the animals were killed.
   Barbee said the Park Service will try to develop ways to better
control the size of the northern herd to keep it below 300 animals.
But he said ways to do that ``haven't been worked out'' yet. He
ruled out the possiblity that hunters would be allowed to hunt the
bison within park boundaries.
   Wyoming, on the park's southern edge, does not allow the
shooting of stray bison.

   A previously unknown group calling itself
The Organization of Just Revenge claimed Wednesday it has kidnapped
an American and two naturalized West Germans in Beirut.
   The claim came in a typewritten statement delivered to a Western
news agency along with photocopies of the passports and visas of
the three victims.
   The American's name was given in the documents as Deborah
Fahrend, 54, of San Francisco. The brief Arabic statement said she
is a publisher-journalist.
   The documents identified two Germans as Mounir Shamseddin Sami,
39, born in Lebanon, and his 7-year-old son Danjel, born in Berlin.
   The statement said: ``The Organization of Just Revenge announces
its responsibility for kidnapping the West German Mounir Sami (born
in Lebanon) and his son Danjel Sami and American
publisher-journalist Deborah Fahrend in Beirut for their activities
in Lebanon.''
   There was no further elaboration in the poorly typed statement,
which failed to say when the abduction took place and made no
demands.
   One photocopy showed a visa issued for Ms. Fahrend by the
Lebanese Embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus, on Nov. 1 along with an entry
stamp by the Lebanese security department Nov. 3.
   The two West Germans also entered Lebanon on Nov. 3 on similar
visas, issued by the Lebanese Embassy in Nicosia on the same day
Ms. Fahrend got hers.
   The kidnapping claim could not immediately be verified.
   The American Embassy in Beirut has been closed since Sept. 22.
   The West German Embassy in Beirut said it had no knowledge of
the abduction before the statement was released after nightfall.
   ``But the two victims could be naturalized Germans from Lebanese
descent who are not registered with the embassy in Beirut,'' said a
German official who answered the phone at the embassy. He declined
to give his name.
   Not counting the three people mentioned in the claim, there are
18 foreign hostages being held in Lebanon, including eight
Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Italian
and an Irishman.
   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Most of the hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian extremist
factions.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday
rejected claims that reform in Eastern Europe spell the demise of
socialism and insisted the Communist Revolution ``was not a
mistake.''
   Speaking to a national student conference in Moscow, Gorbachev
also said the existence of two Germanys ``has been recognized by
the world community'' since the end of World War II and even talk
about reunification constitutes interference in the affairs of the
two countries.
   The Soviet Union in the past week has flatly opposed any
suggestion that East and West Germany should be rejoined.
   ``Noting that certain forces in the West try to create the
impression that profound changes in socialist countries signify the
failure of socialist ideas, Gorbachev said that this was wishful
thinking,'' according to the official news agency Tass. It did not
specify which forces Gorbachev had in mind.
   In a televised speech that ran almost two hours, Gorbachev
hammered home to students who he seemed to suspect believed
otherwise that ``the October revolution was not a mistake.''
   Using a persuasive, emotional tone, Gorbachev extolled the
ideology behind the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and condemned
``people who are trying to find the roots of our troubles not in
the distortions of socialism that took place, but in its very
nature and principles.''
   ``We cannot allow dissatisfaction with ourselves, with how we
live now, to be transformed into attempts to question our
indisputable, universally recognized achievements and the choice of
socialism itself,'' he said.
   That Gorbachev felt the need to come to the defense of the most
basic ideological postulates of Soviet society indicated that they
are coming under ever wider attack as the country struggles through
economic crisis and sees East bloc neighbors moving toward
multiparty systems.
   In his remarks about East Germany, which were carried by Tass
but not shown on television, Gorbachev expressed for the second day
in a row concern over Western powers' response to the democratic
upheaval in Eastern Europe.
   At a meeting Tuesday with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas
he denounced calls for ``exporting capitalism'' to Eastern Europe
and said it was ``useless to clamor about victory in the Cold War,
about the disintegration of some or another social system,'' Tass
reported.
   The White House said Wednesday it had ``no apologies'' for
extolling capitalism as a remedy for the economic woes of Eastern
Europe and said the U.S. position should not be offensive to
Gorbachev.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush views the
free-market economy of the United States as the ``pride of the
world and as a good way to reform the economic problems that they
are facing.
   ``We certainly are proud of the capitalist system and the
rewards that it has offered,'' he added. ``We hold it up as an
example to all but we have not tried to dictate it to any of these
countries.''
   Nevertheless, Fitzwater said, all the actions taken by the
United States ``have been appropriate and not been offensive and
have had the desired effect of offering our support without
inciting revolution or other actions that would take the process
backward ... We have no apologies or concern with anything that
we've done at this point.''
   As for the reunification of East and West Germany, Gorbachev
said it ``is not a matter of topical politics. Talking about
reunification would mean interference in the affairs'' of the two
countries, according to Tass.
   Poland and Hungary moved away from single-party Communist rule
earlier this year. East Germany reshuffled its leadership this
month and, in the most striking reform, opened up the Berlin Wall
and allowed its citizens free exit. Czechoslovakia also liberalized
its travel restrictions.
   Other top Soviet officials joined their president in condemning
Western attempts to interpret the instability in the East bloc as
signifying the failure of socialism.
   In Tokyo, Gorbachev adviser Alexander Yakovlev said he was
surprised by Western commentators who interpret the tumult in the
region as demonstrating the failure of socialism and Soviet policy.
   ``This is an obsolete, archaic way of thinking,'' the Politburo
member told a news conference Wednesday. ``We would like to have a
common European house based on freedom. If someone interferes in
that process, we might go back to the time of the Cold War.''
   Gorbachev's speech to the students touched on the widespread
alienation from the Communist Party among Soviet youth and their
slack support for the Kremlin's reforms.
   His statements appeared at least in part to be a response to a
recent poll published in the state-controlled press that found 17
percent of Soviet students thought the October Revolution was a
mistake.
   He reprimanded students for ``sleeping through'' the elections
to the Congress of People's Deputies this spring, and warned them
that allowing their youthful energy to lead them into pushing for
more radical reform could lead to disaster.
   Despite his support for East Germany's changes, rumors that
Gorbachev would travel to Berlin to participate in demolition of
the Berlin Wall are false, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

   About one in every two Americans believes that
garbage disposal problems rank among the three most pressing issues
facing local governments, exceeded only by fighting drugs and
providing adequate education, according to a survey released
Wednesday by the garbage industry.
   The poll, released by the National Solid Waste Managagement
Association, said 52 percent of the people surveyed nationally
consider ensuring adequate garbage collection is a serious or
extremely serious problem for their local officials.
   That reflected a higher level of concern about garbage
collection than for providing affordable housing or expanding
police and fire protection, said Allen Moore, president of the
trade group that represents waste disposal industry.
   The survey was conducted by Cambridge Reports and included
telephone or face-to-face interviews of 3,000 people during a
four-month period this year. There was a 3 percent margin of error.
   The survey also indicated that public opposition to incinerators
that turn garbage into energy is easing in most parts of the
country amid increasing worries about finding places to bury solid
wastes.
   It said that 44 percent of those surveyed nationwide said they
would favor locating such incinerator plants in their area, 8
percentage points higher than those reponding similarly in a poll a
year earlier. Thirty-six percent of the people opposed such plants
and 20 percent said they didn't know.
   Opposition to burning garbage continued to be greatest in the
Northeast, where a new waste-to-energy plant was favored by only 36
percent of those surveyed, compared to 42 percent who opposed. Even
in that region, however, those who favored a plant incrased by 5
percentage points compared to the 1988 survey.
   The Northeast, however, had the largest percentage of people, 67
percent of those surveyed, who considered garbage collection as a
serious or extremely serious issue facing local governments,
ranking only behind the battle to curb drug abuse.
   Garbage collection issues were found to be of the least concern
in the central part of the country, where it ranked last among five
areas of concern with only 37 percent of the people saying they
considered it a serious local problem.
   In other findings, the poll indicated an increased interest in
recycling programs, but it said the public no longer considers
recycling ``a simple `magic bullet' solution'' to the disposal of
waste products, said Moore, the trade group's president.
   Two-thirds of those surveyed said they had participated in
recycling cans, bottles or papers and 44 percent said they would
buy products containing recycled materials if given a choice,
according to the survey.
   In a related report, the trade group said that as of the end of
September, 38 states and the District of Columbia have enacted some
form of waste recycling laws, although in many cases the full
requirements do not go into effect until the early to mid-1990s.

<TEXT>
   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski pledged
Wednesday that rural VA hospitals in Montana, South Dakota and
other sparsely populated areas will remain open despite budgetary
constraints.
   ``I have no intention of closing and no intention of making
changes that in any way would diminish hospital care in rural
areas,'' Derwinski told the Veterans Affairs Committee. ``These
kinds of locations must stay.''
   Derwinski testified at a hearing into the delivery of health
care to rural veterans. Other witnesses and western state senators
complained that rural veterans suffer from a lack of medical
personnel, a lack of access to health care facilities and a lack of
resources at the rural hospitals since most are unaffiliated with
medical schools.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., complained that policy makers in
Washington are fundamentally oblivious to the needs of rural
America. ``They really don't understand the sense of space and
distance,'' he said.
   Although 95 percent of all veterans live within a 100-mile
radius of the nearest VA facility, according to the American
Legion, in Montana 83 percent of the veterans served by the Miles
City hospital live more than 100 miles from it.
   Baucus noted that Los Angeles has nine centers compared with two
in Montana, and Derwinski noted that in his native Chicago three
hospitals were within six miles from one another.
   Sen. Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., complained that veterans with
non-service-connected disabilities and incomes above $16,500 if
single or $20,000 if married are being denied VA care because of
service cutbacks over the last five years.
   Those ``Class B'' and ``Class C'' veterans are generally
provided care when resources are available. The poorer and
service-connected disabled _ ``Class A'' _ receive first-priority
care.
   Dr. Daniel Winship of the VA's medical division said there was
no policy decision to cut out the B and C patients. He said the
demand for care by Category A patients has ``virtually consumed''
the VA's resources.

   The battle-scarred sandstone columns of the
Brandenburg Gate, which were the backdrop for Hitler's last stand
and a workers' uprising against Communism in 1953, once again tower
over the stage of history.
   The 200-year-old gate, Berlin's most famous landmark, has stood
as the symbol of German division for 28 years.
   With the Berlin Wall quickly crumbling, the gate is being called
the symbol of German unity. It also has been the backdrop for much
of the television coverage beamed around the world in the past week
of fast-moving developments.
   East Germany has said it is considering opening a Berlin Wall
border crossing at the Brandenburg Gate. There was wide speculation
in West Berlin that an opening would be knocked through the wall
Thursday, although there was no official confirmation.
   The gate _ the size of a five-story building _ remained on the
Eastern side when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. The famous
Unten den Linden boulevard ends at the gate.
   On the Western side, the sprawling avenue that leads to the gate
was renamed June 17 Street, after the date of the workers' uprising
in East Berlin in 1953 that was bloodily crushed by Soviet tanks.
   East Berlin workers, angered by the nationalization and
collectivization policies of the Communist government, began their
street demonstrations at the Brandenburg Gate and tore down the red
flag from the top of the gate.
   In the closing days of World War II, Soviet tanks rumbled by the
gate as they closed in on Adolf Hitler's bunker in the chancellery.
Only a few hundred yards away was the heart of Hitler's government
in a small complex on Wilhelmstrasse, which also served as the seat
of the imperial government. The Reichstag also is not far away.
   The Brandenburg Gate also marked Hitler's rise to power. Nazi
brown shirts staged a triumphant torch parade through the gate when
Hitler was named chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933.
   Built from 1788 to 1791 by Carl Gotthard Langhans, the
six-column gate was commissioned by Prussian King Frederick Wilhelm
II. When it was built, it opened the road to the region of
Brandenburg, getting its name.
   The gate was modeled after the Acropolis in Athens to reflect
the king's intention to make Berlin a city of learning and arts.
   On top of the gate is a bronze chariot with the goddess
Victoria. It was hauled away to Paris when Napoleon defeated the
Prussians at Jena and Auerstadt on Oct. 27, 1806. He marched into
Berlin through the Brandenburg Gate.
   The chariot was brought back to Berlin after Napoleon's defeat
in 1814. After the Franco-German war in 1870-71, the victorious
Prussians made a triumphal return to Berlin, the new imperial
capital, again through the Brandenburg Gate.
   The gate was heavily damaged in the last days of World War II
and marked the border between the Soviet and British sectors of
conquered Berlin.
   It was restored between 1956 and 1958. The chariot was repaired
and paid for by West Berlin under Mayor Willy Brandt, but East
Berlin authorities removed the Prussian eagle and the iron cross
from Victoria's staff before mounting it again.
   In 1963, Communist soldiers dropped huge red drapes over the
gate to prevent President John F. Kennedy from looking into East
Berlin when he visited West Berlin and delivered his ``Ich bin ein
Berliner'' speech.
   The gate, the last of the 20 gates to Berlin still standing, is
66 feet high, 215 feet wide and 36 feet deep.

   A newly approved drug appears to be the first to
slow Parkinson's disease, seeming to cut the destructive
progression of the incurable brain illness in half, a major study
confirms.
   The research, conducted on 800 people, found that the drug
deprenyl helped people who were not yet sick enough to require
levodopa, the standard medicine for Parkinson's.
   The results are similar to a smaller study, conducted on 54
patients, that was published in August.
   ``It does not stop the disease,'' said Dr. Ira Shoulson. ``But
it may well slow the disease. This may be the first treatment for a
neurodegenerative disorder that actually slows the disease.''
   Until now, levodopa has been the mainstay of Parkinson's
treatment, easing symptoms but not slowing the underlying disease.
Doctors usually reserve this drug until relatively severe symptoms
develop.
   The incurable disease attacks a region of the brain, causing
shuffling gait, difficulty talking and other symptoms. It typically
strikes people in their 50s and 60s and affects about 500,000
Americans.
   The latest study began in 1987 and was scheduled to continue
until late next year. However, researchers stopped the study in
February because of indications of a dramatic effect from the
medicine.
   When the results were analyzed, doctors found the treatment had
reduced the need for levodopa by 57 percent.
   ``Over 12 years, this might buy 50 percent more time of less
impaired disability,'' said Shoulson, who directed the study at the
University of Rochester Medical Center.
   In their report, the researchers wrote that ``the results
translate into a delay in the development of disability of nearly
one year (over the two-year study period) and an extended capacity
for full-time employment.''
   The study was conducted by members of the Parkinson Study Group
at 28 medical centers in the United States and Canada. It was
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   In the study, 399 people with early, untreated Parkinson's
disease were given deprenyl, while 401 others received another
experimental medicine or dummy pills. During the followup, 97 of
those who got deprenyl worsened enough to need levodopa, compared
with 176 in the comparison group.
   At the start of the study, people's symptoms included mild
tremors, stiffness and slow movement. By the time they needed
levodopa, they often had to stop working or had trouble caring for
themselves.
   The doctors are not sure how deprenyl works, but they speculated
that it somehow slows the underlying disease process rather than
simply easing symptoms.
   The drug, sold under the brand name Eldepryl, was approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for routine use in September.
   The latest study will continue to test the effect of the
medicine when combined with levodopa in people with advanced
Parkinson's disease.
   The earlier study with the drug was conducted by Dr. J. William
Langston of the California Parkinson's Foundation in San Jose and
published in the journal Science.
   In another report Wednesday on Parkinson's disease, University
of California researchers said they have found that implanting
genetically altered skin cells in the brains of rats can reduce
symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The skin cells were genetically
altered to make them produce L-dopa, a chemical that is lacking in
the brains of Parkinson's disease patients.
   The research does not portend a cure for Parkinson's and is not
ready for human testing, but it may offer a possible alternative to
fetal cell implants, which have proved effective against the
disease but which have become mired in political and ethical
controversy, scientists said.
   The results of the study, conducted by Gage and colleagues at
the University of California at San Diego, including Dr. Theodore
Friedmann, a pioneer in the development of genetically modified
cells, were to be published in the latest issue of Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences.

   Palestinian and Israeli groups that monitor human
rights violations on the West Bank and Gaza Strip will share the
1989 Carter-Menil Human Rights Award, the Carter Center announced
Wednesday.
   The fourth annual $100,000 prize will be presented to the two
organizations Dec. 9 at former President Jimmy Carter's annual
address on the state of human rights in the world.
   The groups are al-Haq, the West Bank affiliate of the
International Commission of Jurists, and B'Tselem, a group of
Israeli lawyers, intellectuals, journalists and lawmakers.
   ``These organizations, one Palestinian and the other Israeli,
share the goal of promoting basic human dignity,'' Carter said in a
statement released by the center.
   ``In the face of repeated condemnation, harassment and sometimes
even physical abuse, the members of these two groups have not
wavered in their determination to expose, condemn and prevent
violations of human rights.''
   Dominique de Menil, of Houston, president of the Carter-Menil
Foundation, said that by giving the award the foundation ``hopes to
highlight the urgent need to support all parties in the region that
are actively engaged in the search for justice, human rights and
peace.''
   Al-Haq was founded in 1979 to identify and document human rights
violations. B'Tselem was founded last February to respond to a lack
of debate among Israelis on human rights issues.
   The Carter-Menil Foundation's advisory committee, which
nominates award recipients, is made up of members of several human
rights organizations.
   Previous winners were Soviet dissident Yuri Orlov and the Group
for Mutual Support of Guatemala, an organization of family members
of Guatemalans who have vanished in political and military
violence, in 1986; La Vicaria de Solidaridad of Chile in 1987; and,
in 1988, the Sisulu family of South Africa.
   The Sisulu family patriarch, Walter Sisulu, an anti-apartheid
leader, was freed in October after more than 25 years in prison.

<HEAD>Gov't Says Rebels Attack Jalalabad, Denies Military Post Taken</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 guerrillas have
attacked the eastern city of Jalalabad and are peppering the city
with rockets and heavy artillery, the government said Wednesday.
   But the Soviet-backed government denied guerrilla claims of
capturing a strategic army stronghold in the mountains west of
Kabul, whose only road to the Soviet Union remained closed for a
seventh day. The cutoff drove up prices of flour and gasoline.
   Government spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani said bands of the
U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas from a number of groups united to
launch the attack on Jalalabad, the site of a failed rebel attack
in March. The government's Bakhtar News Agency reported that
guerrillas were also shelling the road from Jalalabad to Kabul in
an attempt to close it.
   Amani said the guerrillas were trying to take a military
garrison at Dolunta, about 12 miles west of the city. But he said
government troops pushed them back.
   On Monday, the government claimed 10,000 guerrillas were
preparing to attack the city. They failed to take Jalalabad earlier
this year because they could not unite and lacked experience in
launching conventional operations. Also government bombers proved
successful at knocking out guerrilla positions, diplomats have said.
   Amani said the Afghan air force bombed rebel artillery in
Samarkhail and other villages near Jalalabad. He said guerrillas
forces were preparing an attack on Khost, a strategic city south of
Jalalabad in Paktiya province.
   Both cities are close to the Pakistan border, where the
guerrillas have bases.
   The government denied a claim that guerrilla forces had captured
a government garrison in Pajak, 18 miles west of Kabul in the
mountains. Guerrilla-run radio in Pakistan claimed its forces took
the stronghold late last week. Western diplomats in Pakistan said
the guerrillas were steadily chipping away at Kabul's security
perimeter and the latest battle linked forces west and north of the
capital.
   Amani said the stronghold had not fallen and that military
activity in the area was quiet. Soldiers with knowledge of the
situation in Pajak said fighting was fierce but that guerrilla
forces had not succeeded in taking the garrison. Earlier this week
the government fired several Soviet-made Scud rockets to the west
along with dozens of smaller rockets.
   Soldiers with knowledge of the Salang highway, the main road to
the Soviet border, said guerrilla forces near the Salang tunnel,
about 60 miles from Kabul, had closed the highway for the last
week. They said more than 3,000 trucks were waiting to come south
to Kabul, carrying food, gasoline and weapons.
   Witnesses from Salang said guerrillas in the area claimed the
government was trying to move 800 tanks down the highway in
addition to food and fuel. Soldiers confirmed that tanks were being
transported to military bases near the capital but said they did
not know how many.
   In Kabul, prices of flour went back up to $4 for a 15-pound
sack, after falling to $3.50 last week when the road was open.
   The government acknowledged the highway had been closed but said
it was caused by damage due to mines. Rebel forces closed the
highway for 10 days last month, causing prices of flour and
gasoline to jump 50 percent.
   The Soviet Union completed pulling out its troops in February,
more than nine years after sending in forces to support a Marxist
regime.

<HEAD>Kirkland Re-Elected; Five New Members of AFL-CIO Governing Body</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lane Kirkland was elected Wednesday to a sixth
term as AFL-CIO president and the labor federation reshaped its
governing body to include the leader of its newest union, the
United Mine Workers.
   UMW President Richard Trumka was among five new members elected
to the 14.1 million-member federation's executive council, a
symbolic gesture to cap the union's decision to rejoin the umbrella
organization after four decades outside.
   Trumka, 40, also adds young blood to a council made up
predominantly of white men in their 50s, 60s and 70s. A woman and a
black union leader also were elected Wednesday, but because of
retirements the number of blacks on the 33-member board fell from
three to two and the number of women held at three. That comes at a
time when some contend that women and minorities are the labor
movement's best hope if it is to reverse its organizing setbacks of
the past decade.
   The federation elections came on a day when the convention
delegates also heard from President Bush and prepared for a debate
Thursday on whether the AFL-CIO should endorse abortion-rights
resolutions.
   A compromise struck this week will allow for debate on the issue
Thursday before the question, which has divided many labor leaders
at a gathering whose theme is solidarity, is referred to he
Executive Council for further study.
   The elections of Kirkland, Secretary Treasurer Thomas Donahue
and the new council members all were by unanimous vote but not
before Hispanic labor leaders protested about being excluded from
the board at a time of mounting efforts to organize Hispanics.
   ``Once again the Hispanics have been excluded from the process
and excluded from the AFL-CIO,'' said Jack Otero, a vice president
of the Transportation and Communications Union. ``This is an
unhappy day.''
   Added United Steelworkers international representative Oscar
Sanchez: ``I leave this conventiom a disillusioned delegate but not
a defeated trade unionist. We will return.''
   Kirkland, in thanking the delegates for their support, said:
   ``I say to you without hesitation or reservation that this is
the most exciting, the most inspiring and the most enthusiastic
time in modern history to be at the center of everything in the
American trade union movement. There is no place on earth I would
rather be and there is nothing that I would rather do.''
   In addition to Trumka, elected to the Executive Council were:
John Sturdivant, president of the American Federation of Government
Employees; Susan Bianchi-Sand, president of the Association of
Flight Attendants; George Kourpias, president of the International
Association of Machinists, and Moe Biller, president of the
American Postal Workers Union.
   ``I see myself as a representative of the service industry and
of women in the work force,'' said the 43-year-old Bianchi-Sand, a
United Airlines flight attendant.
   Trumka, a miner-lawyer whose union is in the midst of a bitter
strike against Pittston Co. coal mines in Virginia, West Virginia
and Kentucky, won a seat on the board just weeks after the United
Mine Workers affiliated with the AFL-CIO.
   Sturdivant, 51, who is black, replaced Kenneth Blaylock, the man
he defeated for the presidency of AFGE, a 700,000 member union
representing federal employees.
   Kourpias, 57, took the slot held by his predecessor, William
Winpisinger, who retired.
   Biller, 73, the longtime New York APWU leader who has been the
365,000-member union's president for nine years, became the second
leader of a postal union on the board, joining National Association
of Letter Carriers President Vincent Sombrotto.

   President Bush told the AFL-CIO today that
labor, business and government should form a new alliance to be
``partners and activists'' for Poland's future.
   He also told the labor federation's biennial convention that he
would discuiss the importance of trade unions in ``building a free
country'' in his Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit off Malta with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Steering clear of issues on which his administration and
organized labor disagree, Bush lavished praise on Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa and praised the federation for its long active support
of Walesa.
   Walesa was present as the president spoke.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, speaking a few hours
before Bush at the labor federation's convention, accused the
president of praising Solidarity while working to undermine U.S.
labor unions.
   ``American workers are entitled to as much support from an
American president as workers in Poland and other countries,'' the
Maine Democrat said.
   He also criticized Bush for refusing to intervene in the
eight-month Eastern Airlines strike.
   But the president focused on Solidarity and the changing face of
Eastern Europe. ``Across Eastern Europe, we see vindication of the
AFL-CIO's refusal to deal with puppet unions controlled by either
employers or governments,'' he said.
   ``The AFL-CIO has fought for ... freedom around the world, and I
will carry that message to Mr. Gorbachev. I also want to talk with
President Gorbachev about the opportunities to move beyond
containment in U.S.-Soviet relations _ to find areas of mutual
advantage in our relationship.''
   Congress is moving to provide more than a half-billion dollars
in economic aid for Poland and Hungary, steps that have the backing
of the administration.
   But Bush said, ``I call on the American labor movement, the
business community and government to look for ways to support a
partnership for progress in Poland.''
   ``Labor, business and government can and should be partners and
activisits for Poland's future,'' he said.
   Earlier, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush is
ready to sign a bill raising the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.25
by April 1991 _ a measure labor helped negotiate.
   Bush's speech came a week after the White House, labor and
congressional Democrats struck a deal to raise the hourly minimum
wage. That has tempered somewhat the criticism of Bush by labor
leaders, but praise for the president is hard to find among the 800
delegates to the 14.1 million-member federation's biennial
convention.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland was unanimously re-elected today
to a sixth-two year term. Thomas Donahue was the unanimous choice
to continue as the federation's secretary treasurer.
   ``I am honored that you have moved to keep me on the bridge as
we move into the last decade of the tumultuous 20th century,''
Kirkland said. ``There is no place on earth that I would rather
be.''
   Many union leaders took the convention floor the past two days
to criticize Bush's stance on issues ranging from child care and
national health care to the Eastern Airlines strike, which Bush in
March refused to block by using his power to name an emergency
mediation board.
   Congress last week gave final passage to a measure creating a
congressional study of the strike designed to produce
recommendations for a settlement, and the labor leaders said a Bush
veto would end any pretense of cordiality between the AFL-CIO and
the administration.
   ``He missed a golden opportunity,'' Air Line Pilots Association
President Henry Duffy said of Bush's refusal to intervene in March.
``He's got another chance now.''
   George Leitz, president of the Transport Workers Union
representing striking Eastern flight attendants added: ``That
kinder, gentler George better not veto this legislation.''
   Moe Biller, president of the American Postal Workers Union,
called on Bushoward labor by lifting the ban on rehiring the air
traffic controllers Reagan fired in 1981 after they struck.
   ``By any measure of justice, these workers have paid the price
for taking actions they felt necessary at the time,'' Biller said
in a Tuesday letter to Bush. ``I ask you to give us a sign
(Wednesday) that there is room for clemency in your
administration.''
   The delegates broke into loud cheering and applause Tuesday when
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Democratic congressional
leaders planned to seek another increase in the minimum wage in
1992, a presidential election year.
   ``If he will not sign it, then we we'll just have to get another
president after 1992 who will,'' Kennedy said.
   Kirkland, who recently referred to Bush as ``Reagan Lite,'' has
tempered his criticisms of late, in part because of the minimum
wage compromise.
   ``We have channels of communication that I think are superior to
those that we had during the Reagan years,'' he said in an
interview last week. ``I think you'd have to say any judgment is
still pending.''
   No such uncertainty clouds labor relation's with Mitchell, who
has increased his stature among the union leaders by successfully
fighting Bush's effort to cut capital gains taxes.
   ``I have considerable and growing admiration for Sen.
Mitchell,'' Kirkland said.
   Kennedy pledged to get a national health care measure to Bush's
desk next year.
   That promise came as delegates approved an aggressive lobbying
effort designed to sway Congress and business leaders into a
compromise agreement on such a plan.

   President Bush should meet with the
NATO allies before _ not after _ his summit next month with
President Mikhail Gorbachev, the head of NATO's legislative arm
said Wednesday.
   Patrick Duffy, president of the North Atlantic Assembly, said it
was ``unthinkable'' Bush would meet with Gorbachev without first
consulting the other members of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Duffy, a member of Britain's House of Commons, said the agenda
for the Dec. 2-3 shipboard meeting off the island of Malta was
likely to be dominated by the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe,
particularly in East Germany.
   NATO sources, who demanded anonymity, said a senior U.S.
official will meet with the allies in Brussels on Dec. 4 to discuss
the summit, but it was not yet certain who that would be.
   In Washington, administration officials have said Bush was
considering calling a NATO summit in Brussels after the Gorbachev
meeting to discuss new political and military strategy for the West.
   The NATO sources said contingency plans were being made for such
a presidential visit.
   French President Francois Mitterrand hurriedly scheduled a
meeting Saturday of all 12 leaders of the European Community, the
Common Market trading bloc, to discuss Eastern Europe.
   Some analysts believe the move was designed to give the
community leaders a chance to discuss the developments before the
Bush-Gorbachev summit.
   Duffy reminded Bush that the political atmosphere in Europe was
sensitive.
   ``There is a great joy and genuine emotion, but there is also a
good deal of confusion and concern about where this process will
eventually take us,'' he said.
   ``It is absolutely imperative,'' he said, ``that the U.S.
president demonstrates a true awareness of the current situation by
offering reassurance and predictability to the European allies.''
   He said Bush has ``a special responsibility and the
international situation demands nothing less than he meet this
responsibility.''
   Duffy cautioned against a replay of the 1986 summit at
Reykjavik, Iceland, between President Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev,
which turned into a much more ambitious meeting than had been
expected.
   Gorbachev arrived with sweeping arms control proposals that
caught the Americans off guard. The allies were furious such
discussions took place without consultations.
   ``Politicians of every stripe in Europe are agreed there must be
no more Yaltas or Reykjaviks,'' Duffy said. ``The present system
would be unable to contain a repetition along these lines.''
   Yalta refers to the controversial 1945 meeting of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, Soviet leader Josef Stalin and British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill at which the shape of post-war Europe
was determined.
   The North Atlantic Assembly is made up of legislators of the
NATO nations.

   Calling cigarettes ``a form of death,'' Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy proposed legislation Wednesday that would give
the government control over tobacco products and finance an
anti-smoking campaign.
   Kennedy, who was joined in a Capitol Hill news conference by
former surgeon general C. Everett Koop, said he decided against
including tough limits on cigarette exports and advertising to
increase the chances that the bill would pass.
   ``The tobacco lobby is still one of the strongest lobbies in the
Congress, there's no question about it,'' said Kennedy, D-Mass.
``This is not an attempt to ban cigarettes,'' he said. ``I think we
can get a greater degree of support with this approach.''
   The legislation, which is still being drafted for introduction
later, would call for a total of $185 million in federal spending
next year on an anti-smoking advertising campaign, grants to
states, schools and businesses that promote anti-smoking programs
and money to establish a new Center for Tobacco Products.
   The center would for the first time give the federal government
regulatory control over the contents of cigarettes. Packs of
cigarettes would be required to carry information either on the
package or inside about the various tobacco additives, ``many of
which are carcinogenic,'' Kennedy said.
   The Tobacco Institute, the tobacco industry's main Washington
lobbyist, said Kennedy was proposing to waste public money to alert
people about something they already know. ``Statistics across the
board show that 99 percent of the American people are aware of what
the surgeon general has to say about smoking,'' said institute
spokeswoman Brennan Dawson.
   Requiring cigarette companies to list ingredients on packaging
would violate trade secrets, Dawson said. And a provision of the
Kennedy bill that would lift a federal prohibition on
state-by-state regulation of advertising would create a
``crazy-quilt'' of local advertising restrictions.
   Koop, who was appointed surgeon general by then-President
Reagan, noted how unusual it is for him to agree with Kennedy.
   ``It's about time that the federal government stood up to be
counted on a product that kills 390,000 people every year,'' Koop
said. ``Cigarettes are the only legal product in America which,
when used as advertised, kills you.''
   Kennedy said he would try to quit smoking cigars, a habit he has
maintained over the years. ``I wish I had never started and I'll do
my best to give it up.''

   The National Park Service said Wednesday it
will try to keep the bison herd in northern Yellowstone National
Park from roaming into Montana, but conceded as many as 200 of the
animals may be shot this winter if they enter the state.
   The killing of nearly 600 Yellowstone buffalo by Montana
ranchers and hunters last winter and spring prompted sharp
criticism from environmentalists and conservationists.
   K.L. Cool, Montana's wildlife director, said Wednesday the state
is trying to av300 animals, so that they can be better
managed and kept out of Montana rangeland.
   Cool and Bob Barbee, superintendent of the park, briefed some
members of Congress as well as environmental and conservation
leaders, on the bison management plan. But they conceded they
haven't figured out how the huge animals will be kept from roaming
out of the park, or how the size of the herd will be reduced.
   ``On the long haul, trying to herd a buffalo doesn't work.
Buffalo are herded where they want to go,'' said Barbee, adding
that efforts will be made to keep the bison in the park by ``gentle
hazing'' and whatever else might work.
   Cool said the state will maintain its policy of shooting any
bison that cross onto Montana state lands until the northern
Yellowstone herd is reduced to about 200 animals. Hunters and
ranchers will be given license to shoot the animals under
supervision from a game warden, he said.
   ``Montana does not want to be viewed as being unrealistic or
uncooperative,'' he said. But he said the state legislature has
required that hunters be free to shoot the bison that roam into the
state.
   Ranchers have complained vigorously that the buffalo cause
damage to property and they fear that they will transmit
brucellosis _ a disease the interferes with reproduction _ to their
cattle. Blood tests have shown that more than half of the bison
killed in Montana last year had brucellosis, he said.
   Most of the vast, federally-owned Yellowstone park lies in
Wyoming but its northern end extends into Montana.
   Wyoming does not allow the shooting of stray bison.
   Yellowstone has about 2,500 bison in three major herds on its
more than 2.4 million acres. But only the northern, or Lamar, herd,
poses a concern to Montana ranchers. Because of a series of mild
winters and other factors, the northern bison herd grew to more
than 900 last year year and most of them roamed along the
Yellowstone River Valley into Montana, where 569 of the animals
were killed last winter and spring.
   That number was unprecedented and prompted criticism from
conservationists and environmentalists. Buffalo have roamed onto
Montana lands for years, but not nearly in the numbers that left
the park last winter.
   According to Montana officials, 190 Yellowstone buffalos were
killed in Montana in 1984 through 1988.
   Barbee said the Park Service will try to develop ways to better
control the size of the northern herd to keep it below 300 animals.
But he said ways to do that ``haven't been worked out.'' He ruled
out the possiblity that hunters would be allowed to hunt the bison
within park boundaries.

<HEAD>Up to 7,000 East German Refugees Expected to Return Home</HEAD>

   As many as 7,000 East Germans who fled to the West
but became disenchanted are expected to return home, a West German
TV network reported Wednesday.
   In recent days there have been reports, some from East Germany,
about a possible large return of those who fled to West Germany in
September and October.
   While those numbers have not been confirmed, it is clear that
some refugees are going home now that East Germany's Communist
leaders have opened borders and promised reforms under increasing
pressure for freedom.
   Communist leaders and opposition groups have urged their
countrymen to stay home to take part in reforms. They also have
expressed hope some of the 200,000 mostly young people who have
fled to the West this year will return.
   West Germany's ZDF television network said as many as 7,000 East
Germans were expected to return, 3,000 less than predicted by East
Germany.
   ``Every day about 30 people knock on the door here and ask to
re-enter the German Democratic Republic,'' said Peter Heyn, deputy
chief of a returnee center in East Berlin's northeastern Buch
district. ``The climate in the Federal Republic (West Germany) has
gotten colder.''
   Heyn predicted the center's capacity of 150 people would be
reached soon. About 60 Germans disappointed with capitalist life in
the West reportedly arrived at the center Wednesday.
   Contrary to the past, ``we are trying everything'' to simplify
procedures for regaining East German citizenship, Heyn said.
   A 48-year-old warehouse worker said he left West Germany a few
days ago after four years, feeling ``totally disappointed.''
   ``I was allegedly too old for a job,'' he said, requesting
anonymity. ``It wasn't for me. I wanted to come back mainly because
of the security, which I missed quite a bit in the Federal
Republic.''
   Meanwhile, the East German Red Cross, which said it was bracing
for a return wave of up to 10,000, opened four reception centers
along the border with West Germany.
   Authorities in cities such as Magdeburg and Erfurt readied
emergency shelters in military barracks, schools and dormitories.
   West German Red Cross officials in Bonn said that while buses
were on standby, no major organized return was planned for the
moment.
   Officials said a flow back to East Germany would be difficult to
document since many would simply return to their homes and most had
become West German citizens, meaning they are not registered when
leaving the country.
   A major outflow is expected from Bavaria, which borders on
southern East Germany, East Germany's official ADN news service
said.
   East German officials say the government will loan each returnee
150 marks in immediate aid and 15 marks for each day of
unemployment. The 150 marks is about one-tenth of a worker's
average monthly wage.

   The State Department expressed concern
Wednesday about recent fighting in Cambodia and urged various
factions to return to the negotiating table to seek a political
settlement.
   The statement came on the eve of a U.N. vote on Cambodia's seat
at the international body. The United Nations is expected to
confirm retention of the seat by an opposition coalition that
includes non-communist factions backed by the United States.
   ``There has been military activity by the Khmer Rouge and other
elements in Cambodia,'' said Richard Boucher, a department
spokesman. ``We regret the return to the battlefield in Cambodia
and we support all efforts to return to the negotiating table as
soon as possible.''
   ``A comprehensive settlement, which we think is still needed,
will require agreement among the Cambodian facions and the other
involved parties on the formation of an interim coalition
authority,'' he said.
   Last summer, a Paris peace conference on Cambodia dissolved over
the failure to reach agreement on the Khmer Rouge's involvement in
an interim government. Under leader Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge killed
more than one million people before Vietnam invaded Cambodia in
1978.
   Vietnam, which installed a puppet government in Phnom Penh, said
its occupation troops have been withdrawn as of Sept. 31. Last
week, Britain became the first Western nation to acknowledge that
Vietnamese forces are no longer in Cambodia.
   The Chinese, who have supplied the Khmer Rouge, and the
non-communist opposition coalition contend Vietnamese troops remain
in Cambodia disguised as Cambodians.
   In a related development, Congress is continuing restrictions on
President Bush's ability to send weapons to non-communist factions,
according to congressional sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The restrictions, adopted over the administration's objections,
prevent the president from using contingency funds from the CIA to
arm the Cambodian guerrillas unless Congress approves the action
first. The restrictions are contained in a secret appendix to the
military appropriations bill.

   Through what was called ``a miracle of
international cooperation,'' three of four fingers were reattached
to a Polish sailor's hand, more than two days after they were
severed in a shipboard accident.
   Dr. Jimmy Chow, director of replantation and chief of the
microvascular surgery team at the Washington Hospital Center, said
Wednesday the fingers were not reattached to the hand of Zbyskyo
Kajowski for more than 54 hours.
   This appears to be a record because the longest time previously
known between this type of accident and reattachment was 39 hours,
said Chow, who coordinated the surgery.
   The accident occurred aboard the Greek freighter, SS Success, on
Nov. 6 some 500 miles off Bermuda when Kajowski's hand was caught
under falling machinery, doctors said.
   Kajowski, 39, suffered what Chow characterized as ``a severe
crush-amputation'' injury that severed the four fingers of the left
hand where they meet the palm.
   The ship captain received emergency advice from Dr. Edward
Schultze, head of the emergency room at King Edward VII Hospital in
Bermuda. That included immersion of the digits in a saline solution
and keep them cool but not frozen.
   Paramedics on the ship gave Kajowski emergency first-aid and
doctors on Bermuda contacted the U.S. Coast Guard, which called
Chow, the doctor said.
   ``Right then time was important,'' Chow said. ``The ship was two
days away from where it could meet a U.S. Navy helicopter that
could take the sailor to Bermuda. ... It was a miracle of
international cooperation.''
   Once the freighter reached the rendezvous point, Kajowski was
flown to Bermuda by a Navy helicopter.
   Kajowski received emergency treatment in Bermuda and the Greek
shipping company authorized a private air ambulance to fly the
sailor to Washington.
   The surgery, performed on Nov. 8, took nearly 15 hours, Chow
said.
   All of the severed digits except for Kajowski's index finger
were able to be saved.
   Chow said the prognosis for a full recovery by his patient was
excellent. He said that although the sailor was still hospitalized,
he has made a fist and straightened his damaged fingers.
   Kajowski will be able to return to sea, Chow said, and should be
able to perform all the duties he could in the past.

<HEAD>Policy Requires Teachers, Counselors to Report Sexually Active Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MESA, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new state law on child abuse has prompted
Arizona's largest school district to enact a policy requiring
teachers and counselors to report to police the names of sexually
active students.
   The legislator who co-sponsored the child-abuse law said
reporting sexually active students wasn't her intent and she'll
work to revise the measure.
   ``We rewrote the law to bring the state's child abuse reporting
laws up to federal specifications,'' said Rep. Leslie Johnson. ``We
never thought it could be construed as it has been in the Mesa
district.''
   In the meantime, school officials say some students won't talk
to them about such problems as pregnancy and sexually transmitted
diseases, knowing a police investigation might ensue.
   ``The youngsters tend to clam up when we tell them we can no
longer promise confidentiality,'' said Mountain View High School
Principal James Curlett said. ``They will turn to their friends for
help, and when it comes to advice about subjects like communicable
diseases, that would be disastrous.''
   Dobson High School counseling director Bob Merlene, said the
policy probably will deter some students from seeking counseling.
   ``This policy does more to scare than to help our students,'' he
said.
   Changes made this year in Arizona's child-abuse reporting
statute require schools to report to police any student who they
have reasonable grounds to believe has been a victim of sexual
abuse, sexual conduct with a minor, sexual assault, sexual
molestation, commercial sexual exploitation of a minor, incest or
child prostitution.
   The previous law required reporting only in cases of sexual
molestation.
   However, as interpreted by Mesa schools and Mesa police, school
officials must inform police of any and all sexual activity. The
Mesa district has 61,700 students and covers most of Mesa, parts of
two other Phoenix suburbs, and the Salt River Indian Reservation.
   ``Our interpretation of the law is that the school district must
report all sexual activity among students, and then it is up to the
police to determine if it is a situation in which there is
reasonable grounds to believe a minor has been abused,'' said Sgt.
Mike Hayes, Mesa police spokesman.
   Hayes said that if two 15-year-olds are kissing and fondling
each other under the bleachers, and a teacher sees them, the
teacher is obligated under the new law to report the incident to
police for investigation.
   The number of child abuse reports to police by school officials
hasn't increased since the district policy went into effect in
September, Hayes said.
   Fred Skoglund, assistant superintendent of the Mesa district,
said the problem is in the wording of the legislation.
   ``We believe we are forced to comply with the letter of the law,
even though we do not believe it was the intent,'' Skoglund said.
   However, officials from the neighboring Tempe and Chandler
districts said they interpreted the law differently. They said
their reporting procedures haven't changed and that police are only
called in instances of obvious abuse.

<HEAD>Old Times at White House: President Reagan, Vice President Bush</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was like old times Wednesday as former
President Reagan and wife, Nancy, returned to the White House for
the first time for the unveiling of their official portraits.
   President Bush referred repeatedly to his predecessor as ``Mr.
President.''
   Reagan called him ``George'' and, in a tribute to Bush's past
role as understudy, ``Vice President Bush.''
   Bush confided that he had a little difficulty adjusting to their
changed circumstances.
   Bush joked to the crowd of 100 former Reagan administration
officials and other VIPs gathered in the East Room:
   ``When the announcer here said, `Mr. President,' well, I fell
back to where I comfortably was for eight years. It seemed most
appropriate.''
   It wasn't the day's only honor for Reagan.
   Senate Republicans named their campaign committee's headquarters
the Ronald Reagan Republican Center and Reagan, attending the
Capitol Hill ceremony, noted it wasn't the first time he had been
so honored.
   ``There is another building named for me. It's a saloon in ...
Ireland,'' Reagan told the outdoor gathering of 1,000 GOP partisans
at the dedication ceremony.
   At the conclusion of the ceremony, Reagan and wife were
presented with a watercolor of the building. ``Now,'' he said, ``I
can replace the photograph of the saloon.''
   The White House portraits of the Reagans were painted by New
York artist Aaron Shikler.
   Reagan is shown on a 50-inch-high canvas in a blue suit and red
tie, his fingers on his Oval Office desk, a bookcase and a bronze
cowboy statue behind him. Mrs. Reagan is depicted in a full-length
red gown, standing in profile before the closed mahogany doors
outside the State Dining Room.
   Both Reagans beamed as Bush showered them with praises, saying
their portraits will hang in the White House to ``remind future
generations about two of its greats.''
   He called Reagan ``one of the most beloved presidents in the
history of the Republic,'' and said he deserves more credit than
anyone else for the democratic changes taking place around the
world.
   The painting ``reflects the qualities that make him so special _
kindness, gallantry, decency and humor,'' said Bush.
   He praised Nancy Reagan for her beauty, taste and anti-drug
crusade and said, ``Over the years there have been many wonderful
presidents and first ladies. But thanks to you, I don't believe
this place has ever had a better team.''
   ``Nancy, don't fail to take a look,'' quipped Reagan when he got
to speak. ``They're sure different than a lot of those cartoons we
had to put up with.''
   The former president, now living in retirement in Bel-Air,
Calif., called it a ``very special day in Nancy's and my life.''
   ``Incidentally, I want to say here with the very kind things
that George was saying: I think attention has to be called to the
fact that whatever we accomplished, Vice President George Bush was
a major part of everything we did.''
   ``Maybe it's because my staff is a bit smaller now than it used
to be, but I can't really find the words to express how I feel to
be back here in this house,'' said the 78-year-old Reagan, his
graying hair back almost to regular length following surgery in
September that caused him to shave it off.
   ``There are really no words to convey what it means to Nancy and
me to be here, to walk in these hallowed halls again,'' Reagan said.
   The Petrie Foundation and the White House Historical Association
commissioned the paintings and donated them to the White House.
Shikler redid Reagan's portrait after Mrs. Reagan expressed
disappointment with the first.
   Shikler also did the White House paintings of the late President
John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline.
   Reagan's portrait will hang on the State Floor with other 20th
century presidents. Mrs. Reagan's 44-inch-high canvass will hang on
the ground floor corridor with portraits of other recent first
ladies.
   With the ceremony over, as a Marine band began to play outside
the East Room, Reagan returned to the microphone for one last
anecdote.
   He recalled how once at a state dinner for French President
Francois Mitterrand and his wife, Nancy had escorted Mitterrand off
to her table but Mrs. Mitterrand just stood there and ``said
something to me in French which I didn't understand.''
   ``Then the interpreter caught up with us and told me what she
was saying. I was standing on her gown!''

   The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
reopens Saturday, restoring the key link between two cities
battered by a major earthquake that forced harried commuters onto
trains, ferries and buses.
   State Department of Transportation officials had hoped to open
the bridge by Friday, exactly one month after a 50-foot section of
the span's upper roadway dropped onto the lower during the Oct. 17
quake, claiming one life.
   They almost made it. But two days of foggy nights created enough
moisture to interrupt stripe painting on the 53-year-old bridge,
which carried more than 260,000 vehicles every working day prior to
the quake.
   Vehicle traffic will start moving across the 8.5-mile span as
soon as possible after midnight Friday, according to Burch
Bachtold, regional director for the state Department of
Transportation (Caltrans).
   Hikers will get a chance to try the bridge even earlier _ at $5
each. Thousands are expected to take part Thursday, with proceeds
going to pay for buses to take them to the bridge. Anything left
over will go to quake relief.
   Although many are expected to return to their autos, there are
some who will continue to use mass transit.
   Ben Scauzzo of Pleasant Hill, about 30 miles east of San
Francisco, switched to BART after years of using his car.
   ``But no more,'' he said on Wednesday. ``Now I'm going to
continue (riding the train.) My biggest problem is figuring out the
tickets.''
   But Paul Smith, a federal employee, is a commuter who thinks
BART is too limiting.
   ``BART only goes to certain places. Time is important to me. I
think with my car I can increase my work production time two or
three times.''
   Caltrans officials announced last week they hoped to reopen the
bridge on Nov. 17, one month after the 15-second quake struck
Northern California at 5:04 p.m., killing 66 people and causing $7
billion in damage. The earthquake also interrupted the World Series
between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics, an
event symbolized by the bridge on T-shirts and other memorabilia.
   The department originally predicted the span would reopen around
Thanksgiving. Denny McLeod, president of Rigging International of
Alameda, one of the repair contractors, said planning alone for
such a job usually takes a month.
   ``Here, we had to do it right on the spot,'' he said. ``You have
to make a lot of judgment calls fast and every one of them has to
be right.''
   The first step was to make sure the damaged decks didn't fall
through to the bay. Working 12-hour shifts, crews cut the damaged
upper deck into two pieces, then used a crane to lower them to a
barge below.
   McLeod devised a hydraulic jack to pull the bridge back
together. The quake had pulled the eastern approach about seven
inches toward Oakland; the bridge moved back two inches after the
shaking stopped.
   ``We had to make it ourselves,'' he said, adding that the jack
pulled about 10 million pounds of weight back toward San Francisco.
   The next major steps involved installing new girders, placing 20
new I-beams, lowering 42 precast deck sections and then pouring
concrete between them.
   Repairs were done using a technique first employed in the 1950s
when train tracks were ripped from the lower deck.
   ``That was when we first used prefabricated concrete sections,''
said Bob McDouglad, Caltrans' local chief of maintenance.
   The bridge collapse forced thousands of commuters to abandon
their beloved cars for Bay Area Rapid Transit trains, a hastily
assembled ferry fleet or buses. Commuters who insisted on driving
added many extra miles, taking roundabout routes over still-useable
bridges in other parts of the region.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and Bachtold on Tuesday
walked to the spot where the bridge snapped. Skinner said he hoped
people who used mass transit during the closure would stick with it.
   ``The nation can't afford the single occupant vehicle,'' he said.
   ``There are going to be tremendous traffic problems for at least
a year because of earthquake damage,'' said Assemblyman Tom Bates
of Oakland. ``It seems like an excellent time to get reliable,
timely public transportation in place.''

<TEXT>
   The 20-foot obelisk known as the white
supremacy monument was taken apart and moved Wednesday from the
foot of Canal Street to a warehouse.
   The Streets Department says the monument, erected in 1891 to
commemorate a white uprising which overthrew the Reconstruction
government in 1874, is being moved on advice of engineers for
traffic improvements.
   The National Association for the Advancement of White People,
which founder and former Ku Klux Klan imperial wizard David Duke
calls a white civil rights group, initially objected to moving it.
   It is inscribed with the names of 16 members of the White League
who died in the 18-minute battle. An inscription praising white
supremacy was added in 1932, and white supremacy groups have
rallied near the monument for decades.
   The NAAWP complained to state and national preservation
officials, who worked out an agreement under which the city may
store the monument for 18 months, but must put it back up by May 1,
1991, within two blocks of the original site.

   Police arrested 18 people on charges of
selling counterfeit Batman clothes, posters and accessories with
the comic book hero's logotype, the Attorney General's office said
Wednesday.
   According to a communique from the Attorney General's office,
the people produced fake Batman products and distributed them to
stores and street markets throughout Mexico City. The movie
``Batman'' has been a hit since it opened here two months ago, and
T-shirts and other Batman products are hot sellers.
   Police seized 39,000 counterfeit T-shirts, another 20,000
Batman-related products as well as stamping and decal-making
equipment and presses for clothing. The souvenirs also included
buttons, notebooks and bottle openers.
   Seven businesses were closed, the communique said.
   Police raided the businesses after the only legal Batman
concessionaire in Mexico filed a complaint, the statement said.

   Sheriff's deputies posing as students
spent six months in high schools looking for drug use, but came up
empty-handed.
   ``It's great news,'' Jill Fox, Douglas County schools
spokeswoman, said Tuesday. ``It really gives a strong picture of
the teachers and administrators and the kids.''
   Sheriff's Lt. Bill Walker said the operation was planned in
August 1988 after a school district survey showed an alarmingly
high amount of drug use by young people outside the schools.
   The sheriff recruited an undisclosed number of officers to
mingle with students in the county's three high schools last spring
and this fall.
   The officers fooled students and teachers, by doing homework,
going to football games and hanging out with students. But they
failed to make a single drug purchase, officials said.
   ``We're not denying there's a drug problem, but we're saying
we're being successful at keeping it out of the schools,'' Walker
said. ``It shows a lot of the drug education and concern by the
schools and the sheriff's department is starting to pay off.''

<HEAD>State of Siege Declared, 700 Arrested</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government declared a 3-month state
of siege Wednesday and rounded up at least 700 teachers and labor
leaders a day after negotiations with striking teachers broke down.
   Three teachers were in critical condition after a 24-day hunger
strike and were rushed to private clinics where they were placed
under intensive care.
   Many of the teachers and unionists who were arrested were sent
to detention centers in the Bolivian tropics, said Undersecretary
of the Interior Raul Loayza.
   The state of siege allows police to arrest and hold someone
without charge for 48 hours without a judicial order. Rules
governing public meetings and other activities must be determined
by state governments.
   The center-left government of President Jaime Paz Zamora said it
acted to guarantee peaceful local elections next month.
   The hunger strike ended with the state of siege and most schools
were open Wednesday for final exams. There was little police
presence in La Paz and other cities, and business and commercial
activity was normal.
   Power stations in La Paz were guarded by soldiers but no
violence was reported.
   The move came a day after salary negotiations between the
government and the Union of Education Workers, representing the
country's 80,000 public schoolteachers, broke down.
   The teachers, who earn $75 a month, have been demanding a $103
bonus to compensate for cost of living increases. Hundreds of
teachers joined the strike to pressure Paz Zamora's government to
provide the bonus.
   The government says it cannot afford to pay the bonus because of
the state of the economy. Education spending takes up 18 percent of
the country's budget.
   In recent days, teachers and students clashed with police in La
Paz, and the government closed schools two weeks ago when tens of
thousands of workers marched in support of the teachers.
   Paz Zamora's government, trying to maintain an austerity plan,
said in the state of siege decree that the illegal strike created
``a climate of social unrest with demands that the state cannot
attend without risking the economic and financial stability of the
country.''
   The decree said it guarantees the campaign activities of
political parties for the municipal elections scheduled for Dec. 3,
and that the balloting ``must take place, for which it is necessary
to preserve the political rights of citizens and political
parties.''
   The minimum monthly wage is $25. The cost of living, meanwhile,
is one of the highest in South America, with the prices of poultry
and dairy products comparable to those in the United States and
Europe.
   Paz Zamora, who heads the Social Democratic Movement of the
Revolutionary Left, pledged to maintain stability after taking
office Aug. 6 and has continued austerity measures of the previous
government.
   The measures include a wage freeze and lower government spending
to combat a 1985 annual inflation rate of 24,000 percent. The rate
has since dropped to 12 percent, and the economy is expected to
grow by 2.5 percent this year after years of decline.
   In response to a general strike, the previous government also
declared a 90-day state of siege after 45 days in office.

   A policeman who fatally shot a black motorcyclist
acted recklessly and in defiance of police regulations, prosecutors
said Wednesday as the trial opened into two deaths that touched off
racial violence in January.
   Defense attorneys said their client shot in self-defense.
   William Lozano 31, faces two manslaughter counts in the slayings
of the driver, Clement Lloyd, 23, and his passenger, Allan
Blanchard, 24, who died of injuries suffered when the motorcycle
crashed after the shooting.
   Assistant State Attorney Don Horn told the racially mixed jury
that Lozano violated police regulations when he stepped into the
street and fired at Lloyd.
   ``This shooting was not justified,'' Horn said. ``At the time
Lozano fired the shot, he was in no danger of being struck by the
motorcycle.''
   Testimony will show, he said, that Lozano fired at the
motorcycle as it was about to pass him, not hit him.
   ``It was not a life-or-death situation, it was not a
split-second decision and he did not have to shoot,'' the
prosecutor said.
   But defense attorney Roy Black said Lozano acted not out of
racism, but in self-defense as the speeding motorycle headed
directly at him to escape a pursuing squad car. He said no one the
night of the shooting could see each other well enough in the
Overton neighborhood to determine skin color.
   ``Officer Lozano did not shoot his gun because he is Hispanic,''
Black said. ``Clement Lloyd did not die because he was black.''
   Lozano shot only because the motorcycle, driven by a desperate
Lloyd, was about to run into him, the defense contends.
   ``He had a second, a half second, to make a decision to save his
life,'' Black said.
   Dade Circuit Judge Joseph Farina cleared the last barriers to
the trial by rejecting defense contentions that the threat of
violence hung over the trial and could frighten jurors into
convicting Lozano to avoid another riot.
   The six-member jury is made up of two blacks, one Hispanic and
three whites. The alternates are two Hispanics and two whites.
   The shooting took place Jan. 16 as the Colombian-born Lozano and
his partner were stopped on a street in the predominantly black
Overtown, talking to the victim of a minor crime. As they talked,
another squad car was chasing down a speeding motorcycle driven by
Lloyd and carrying Blanchard.
   When the motorcycle turned onto the street where Lozano was
standing, the officer fired one shot from his police weapon,
killing Lloyd instantly and sending the motorcycle crashing into a
car. Blanchard died later.
   One of the prosecution's star witnesses, Eddie Johnson,
testified later Wednesday that he had been talking to Lozano and
his partner about his stolen license plate tag when the shooting
occurred.
   Johnson said he spotted the motorcycle and called it to the
attention of Lozano, who was looking for a theft form in the trunk
of his police car.
   ``He went a few steps and put his radio up,'' said Johnson. ``He
took a few more steps with his weapon. He aimed it in that general
direction. ... I ducked. When I ducked, I heard the shot,'' Johnson
said.
   He estimated the motorcycle was going at 50 or 60 miles per
hour. But on cross examination by Black, Johnson admitted he had
given a higher speed in his initial statements to police and he
also acknowledged telling police he could not determine if the
motorcyle was heading directly for Lozano.
   Within an hour after the shooting, an angry crowd of Overtown
residents had gathered and began pelting officers with rocks and
bottles. The violence quickly spread into a three-day riot during
the week leading up to the Super Bowl in Miami.
   The disturbances left one looter shot to death, 11 people
injured by gunfire and 13 buildings burned down.
   Lloyd was later found to have high levels of alcohol and THC _
the active chemical in marijuana _ in his bloodstream at the time
of his death. He also had 5.5 grams of marijuana and $1,500 in cash
in his pocket, facts the defense contends shows he was a
drug-crazed dealer desperate enough to run down a policeman to
avoid arrest and more jail time.
   The city later set up a commission to examine the roots of the
racial disturbance, the fourth to hit Miami in the 1980s. The
previous disturbances were sparked by the killing of black men by
officers or the officers' acquittals on similar charges.
   If convicted on both counts, Lozano faces up to 60 years in
prison.

   Police want to permanently barricade streets
surrounding a 12-block area in the San Fernando Valley plagued by
drive-through drug dealing and gang violence.
   ``This would make this area a vastly safer community for the
law-abiding people who live there,'' police Cmdr. Chet Spencer said
Tuesday. ``Why should they be subjected to the danger and the
shootings that go along with drug activity when there is something
that can be done about it?''
   The blockade plans include a guard station to be built and
staffed using donations by apartment owners in the Sepulveda-area
neighborhood. A meeting of residents and city officials is planned
for January to try to work out details.
   Sawhorse barricades were first erected there last week and
police increased patrols in the heavy drug-dealing area, limiting
entry to residents and their guests.
   The effort has been so successful at curbing crime that police
want to make it permanent, said Capt. Mark D. Stevens.
   The plan must first go to the City Council, which holds the
authority to close city streets to the general public, said John
Haggerty, an assistant city attorney.
   Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents the area about 15 miles
northwest of downtown, introduced a measure Tuesday that would keep
the temporary blockades in place as long as police see fit, said
Rick Kunz, a Wachs aide.
   The council will consider Wachs' measure next week. Originally,
the blockades were allowed by a 30-day permit obtained from the Los
Angeles Department of Transportation because of police claims that
there was an unusual danger to the public and property in the area.
   Police barricades on streets plagued by crime were first used in
California three years ago on a three-block stretch of road in
Northridge. Roadblocks have also curtailed drug dealing in the
Pico-Union area near downtown.
   In Miami Shores, Fla., police last year permanently barricaded
several streets to limit access to the suburb. They since have
reported a noticeable reduction in the number of burglaries.

<HEAD>Public Believes Political Bias Growing in News Media</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 8 grafs for grafs 3-9 pvs, Among network ... 11 percent,

clarity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increasingly, the American public has come to
believe there is political bias in news coverage, a new survey
finds.
   Despite that _ and a belief by 63 percent of the American public
that news organizations fuel controversies _ a favorable view of
those organizations is expressed by 82 percent for network TV news,
80 percent for local television news and 77 percent for daily
newspapers, said the Times Mirror survey released Wednesday.
   Among network big names, ABC news anchor Peter Jennings ``is now
the most highly regarded of the television correspondents,''
according to the poll. While his believability rating topped his
network rivals, it dropped five points from its 1985 level. CBS'
Dan Rather lost 10 believability points, ABC's Ted Koppel 9 points,
and NBC's Tom Brokaw 7 points.
   At the other end of the believability scale was Geraldo Rivera
whose rating dropped 48 points between the two surveys.
   The survey, conducted among members of the public, media,
government, academia and business, is the first work of the
Washington-based Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; The Press.
   ``Believability is down, there's just no question about it,''
said Michael Robinson, an associate professor of government at
Georgetown University and associate director of the survey. ``On
the average, news organizations lost nine points on a sale of 100
in terms of believability,'' he said.
   The survey's rating scale includes four categories ranging from
the top (you can believe all or most of what the person says) to
the bottom (believe almost nothing).
   Counting the percentages of respondents ranking news people or
organizations in the top two categories, the top of the list reads:
Jennings 85 percent, Cable News Network 84 percent, The Wall Street
Journal 83 percent, Brokaw 81 percent and Rather and Koppel 79
percent. At the bottom is Rivera at 26 percent.
   Other names and organizations include ABC's Diane Sawyer at 75
percent, The Associated Press 74 percent, ABC's Sam Donaldson 71,
USA Today 70, and columnist George Will 59.
   By comparison, Pope John Paul II gets a rating of 70 percent,
President Bush 63 percent, former President Reagan 47, Johnny
Carson 33, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 29 and businessman
Donald Trump 25.
   ``The most interesting case, bar none for me, is CNN,'' Robinson
said. ``CNN is the only news organization that has sustained no
decrease in believability.''
   The reason, he said, is that CNN concentrates on hard news. ``It
doesn't do a lot of interpretation, doesn't do a lot of
watchdoggery, it just shows hard news, particularly the sort of
news the public is most interested in.''
   The Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Co.'s holdings include the
Los Angeles Times, New York Newsday and the Baltimore Sun. It also
includes a cable television division.
   Pollsters said that since Times Mirror began its research
program five years ago, there has been a ``significant erosion of
public confidence in the press as an objective reporter of the news
and as an impartial observer of the political and social scene.''
   In 1985, 53 percent of the American public believed news media
favored one side in dealing with social and political issues. That
percentage remained in the 50s in five subsequent surveys and rose
to 68 percent in the current one. Similarly those who believe news
organizations ``deal fairly with all sides'' dropped from 34
percent to 28 percent.
   When the press respondents were asked whether news organizations
merely report the news or fuel controversies by their coverage, 46
percent opted for the first and 49 percent for the second. ``Drive
controversy'' also got the nod from 75 percent of the academics, 80
percent of business leaders and 77 percent of government leaders.
   Not surprisingly, members of the news media _ 81 percent _ said
they cover stories about the personal and ethical behavior of
politicians very or fairly responsibly. Only 68 percent of the
general public and 60 percent of government leaders agreed.
   The percentage of people who think news organizations get their
facts straight rose to 54 percent from a low of 40 percent a year
ago. And there was a slight increase in the percentage of those who
believe the press respects people's privacy _ from 14 percent last
year to 23 percent.
   The survey found that the media consistently overstate interest
in news stories. In eight of nine stories cited, the media thought
the public was more interested than the public said it was.
   The greatest overstatements of public interest were on stories
about Pete Rose, the Mike Tyson-Robin Givens divorce and former
House Speaker Jim Wright, the survey said. News about the scandal
at the Department of Housing and Urban Development was the only
instance in which the press correctly gauged the very low level of
public interest.
   Sixty-four percent of the members of the public surveyed said
they read a newspaper nearly every day, while 67 percent said they
regularly watched a network news show.
   A total of 508 media telephone interviews were conducted Aug.
3-Sept. 29, while 275 interviews were conducted with leaders in
business, government and academia Aug. 3-Oct. 6.
   Nearly 100 interviews were conducted with government leaders,
including 38 members of Congress, 12 senaors, nine governors, 21
mayors and 16 senior Bush administration officials. There were 100
interviews with presidents and journalism deans at major colleges
and universities.
   The Gallup Organization conducted a telephone survey of 1,507
adult members of the public Aug. 9-28.
   The margin of error ranged from 3 percentage points for the
largest sample to 11 percentage points for the smallest.

<HEAD>Critics Say UCLA Shouldn't Charge Candidates for Drug Testing Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS activists say UCLA Medical Center was
trying to profit from a government-subsidized research program by
charging patients for AIDS drug studies in which participation is
free around the country.
   ``What UCLA is doing is wrong,'' said Dr. Neil Schram, former
chairman of the Los Angeles City-County AIDS Task Force. ``They are
using this study as a way to make money and in my opinion that is
inappropriate.
   ``Experimental drug treatment programs are federally funded and
they are supposed to be free.''
   Critics claim the medical school, part of the University of
California, Los Angeles, charged patients a $260 consultation fee
to determine their eligibility for the study.
   UCLA's AIDS Clinical Trials unit is one of 46 research
facilities nationwide participating in the study conducted by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to examine
the effects of experimental AIDS drugs such as AZT and DDI.
   Federal health officials said research groups have the option of
charging fees, but believe that UCLA is the only program that does.
   ``I've never encountered it before,'' said Dr. Daniel Hoth,
director of the AIDS program for NIAID.
   Dr. David Hardy, co-investigator of the clinical trial group at
UCLA's AIDS Research Center, said the program charges fees because
the screenings are part of a larger evaluation designed to
determine options in treatment.
   ``The time that we spend with someone in the clinic is not
specifically for participation in the study,'' he said. ``We
discuss much, much more than just the study, such as why they might
want to continue taking AZT or why they can't, and we consider it a
medical consultation.''
   He added that after candidates are chosen, treatment is free.
   To be eligible for the program, a patient must test positive for
the AIDS virus and never have been treated with DDI. The program is
composed of three separate studies to determine the effectiveness
of DDI, in comparison to AZT.
   DDI, or dideoxyinosine, and AZT, now known formally as
zidovudine, both inhibit replication of the AIDS virus.
   AIDS activists claim the program should be free because patients
put their health at risk by taking an experimental drug. They also
claim the fee excludes poor patients who could benefit.
   ``There is already a problem with minorities and poor people
getting experimental drug treatments and this will make it that
more difficult to get access to those drugs,'' said Mark
Kostopoulos, a spokesman for AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power.

   A Christian leader accused Gen. Michel
Aoun on Wednesday of obstructing peace efforts, and the army
commander replied that Christians who support a Syrian-backed plan
should have their throats cut.
   ``We've tried all means to liberate Lebanon from foreign forces
throughout the 14 years of war, but we haven't succeeded,'' said
George Saadeh, head of the right-wing Phalange Party, the largest
Christian political group.
   ``The national reconciliation charter is a peace offensive to
liberate Lebanon without bloodshed,'' he said in an interview,
referring to a plan devised by legislators at a three-week meeting
in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   ``I don't understand why he (Aoun) doesn't want to give peace a
chance,'' Saadeh, 57, said in his home village of Shibtine, 27
miles north of Beirut.
   He was interviewed after Aoun, who commands Lebanon's Christian
army units, declared: ``Those who support the Arab solution deserve
to have their throats and tongues cut. ... We are not going to be
lenient with them.''
   Shiite Moslem militias allied with Iran and Syria battled in
Beirut's southern slums for a second night Wednesday. Police said
two people had been killed and 11 wounded since fighting began
Tuesday between Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian fundamentalist group, and
the more moderate Amal, allied with Syria.
   Amal and Hezbollah are rivals for supremacy among the 1.2
million Shiites, the largest sect in Lebanon's 4 million people.
   Saadeh, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun, also leads the Lebanese
Front alliance of Christian groups and is a member of Parliament.
He was the main Christian negotiator in Taif last month on the plan
to end the sectarian civil war, which has cost more than 150,000
lives.
   Parliament ratified the accord, known in Lebanon as the national
reconciliation charter, on Nov. 4 during a session in
Syrian-controlled north Lebanon that also chose Rene Mouawad, a
Christian, as president.
   Aoun rejected the Taif accord because it does not include a
timetable for withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in Lebanon,
whom he describes as an occupation force.
   Syrian troops are in Lebanon under an Arab League mandate
granted in 1976, the year after the civil war began. They and
Aoun's forces fought a six-month artillery war that killed hundreds
of people, nearly all civilians, before the Arab League arranged a
truce in September.
   The 54-year-old general, who had led a Christian Cabinet since
September 1988 that competed with a Moslem government, decalred
Parliament dissolved in an attempt to stop ratification of the
peace plan. Legislators convened in north Lebanon because he
threatened to shell the Parliament building in Beirut.
   He also claimed Mouawad was elected illegally, but Saadeh said
Wednesday ``the election of President Mouawad is 100 percent in
line with the constitution.''
   Mouawad has designated Sunni Moslem politician Salim Hoss, who
led the Moslem government in competition with Aoun's, as prime
minister to form a national reconciliation government on the basis
of the Taif accord.
   A major goal of the peace agreement is to give Moslems a greater
share of power in Lebanon, where they now make up 55 percent of the
population. Christians were in the majority when the country became
independent of France in 1943 and have controlled the government,
judiciary and army.
   In his capacity as caretaker finance minister, Hoss instructed
the ministry and central bank Wednesday to allow only Mouawad to
withdraw presidential funds, which Aoun had been using.
   Hoss told The Associated Press by telephone the order was
intended to ``stop Aoun from withdrawing from the presidency's
account. Now we have a president. He is the only one who has the
right to control this account.''
   Under an unwritten covenant observed since 1943, Lebanon's
president is Christian, the prime minister Sunni Moslem and the
Parliament speaker Shiite Moslem.
   Saadeh said Aoun's government ``will cease to be a legitimate
cabinet the moment President Mouawad announces the formation of a
new government.''
   The competing Christian and Moslem governments were formed when
President Amin Gemayel's six-year term ended in September 1988 with
Parliament unable to agree on a successor. Hoss had been prime
minister under Gemayel.
   ``We should have listened to the advice of those who cautioned
us that Aoun might become a dictator, a military ruler,'' Saadeh
said.
   The interview was conducted as as delegations from villages in
the northern province of Batroun arrived at his home to
congratulate him for supporting the peace accord.
   An old man hugged and kissed Saadeh, who has represented Batroun
in Parliament since 1968, and said: ``Peace ought to have a hero.
He is the hero of peace.''

   A federal appeal board agreed Wednesday to
review a controversial ruling that set the stage for the Seabrook,
N.H., nuclear power plant to receive a full-power license.
   In a day of developments on the Seabrook issue, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said it was prepared to lay out a timetable
for deciding on a Seabrook license.
   The NRC plan to set its licensing schedule Thursday led Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to charge the NRC with bypassing the
concerns of its own appeal board about the adequacy of emergency
evacuation plans for Newnities around the plant.
   ``I urge the commission to sort out the dubious and chaotic
procedures used by the licensing board,'' Kennedy said. ``Public
safety is the overriding standard and the commission must not be
permitted to sweep it under the r Hampshire commuug in its misguided zeal
to rush a
dangerous nuclear plant into operation.''
   NRC spokesman Joseph Fochard declined to comment on Kennedy's
statement.
   Also Wednesday:
   _The Massachusetts congressional delegation formally requested a
congressional investigation into the procedures the NRC has used in
moving toward a decision on Seabrook.
   _NRC nominee Forrest Remick agreed in a meeting Wednesday
afternoon with Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., to abstain from voteo have promoted
unapproved medical devices, tinctures and pellets as treatments for
AIDS, angina, bone marrow suppression, cancer, Down's syndrome,
epilepsy, cataracts, hemophilia, diabetes, multiple sclerosis,
Parkinson's disease, rabies and tuberculosis.
   The immunization kits appear to have been sold as protection
from polio, scarlet fever, smallpox, measles, typhoid, mumps,
tetanus, whooping cough and diphtheria.
   The FDA said there is no valid vaccine for scarlet fever and
smallpox vaccine is no longer given because the disease has been
eradicated worldwide.

<HEAD>Court Challenge Weighed On Pa. Abortion Controls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennsylvania's passage of the nation's
strictest abortion controls raises the possibility of a court
challenge, but abortion rights advocates were uncertain Wednesday
whether a lawsuit would help their cause.
   The bill, which Gov. Robert P. Casey is expected to sign within
days, was drafted to conflict directly with provisions in the
Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, which established
abortion as a constitutional right, leading supporters have said.
   Abortion rights activists were in a quandary because an attempt
to overturn the bill's provisions might open the way for appeals
that could weaken Roe vs. Wade further.
   In July, the U.S. Supreme Court gave states greater leeway to
restrict abortions; Pennsylvania's law would be the first to take
advantage of that.
   ``We're not going to waltz blindly into any traps. At the same
time, we're going to fight as aggressively as you could imagine to
strike down the parts of this bill that violate women's
constitutional rights,'' said Sue Frietsche of the state American
Civil Liberties Union.
   Elizabeth Hrenda-Roberts, a spokeswoman for Planned
Parenthood-Pennsylvania Affiliates, predicted a suit would be
filed, but suggested it would be structured in a way that would not
necessarily endanger Roe vs. Wade. Any legal action was not
expected for at least several weeks.
   But abortion opponents said the abortion rights camp would take
significant risks in challenging the new provisions.
   ``The pro-choice side is in a Catch-22 position. If they allow
the bill to stand, we've got a good bill in Pennsylvania. ... If
they don't challenge, clearly other states will look at this
legislation and say, `We'll at least get this much.' That's not in
their interest,'' said Denise Neary, Pennsylvania director of the
National Right To Life Committee.
   The bill, which the Senate passed Tuesday, would represent the
most restrictive abortion controls in the nation.
   It would require women to notify their husbands if they plan to
get an abortion; prohibit abortions because of the fetus' sex; ban
abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy, except in cases where
the mother faces death or irreversible harm; and establish a
24-hour waiting period.
   Also, doctors would be required to inform a woman of the likely
age of the fetus before performing an abortion and explain the
risks and alternatives. The proposal would regulate the medical use
of tissue from aborted fetuses.
   Abortion rights advocates say the prohibition on sex-selection
abortions is in direct conflict with the Supreme Court's ban on
restrictions during the first trimester of pregnancy. Another
potential clash is the spousal notification, which pro-choice
leaders have labeled unconstitutional. A third area of dispute
could be the 24-week provision, which would place a ban on
abortions during a period that the court has permitted limited
restrictions.
   The purpose of the sex-selection ban ``is to overthrow Roe vs.
Wade completely and allow state legislatures to ban abortion at any
time for any reason and do away with the trimester system,'' Ms.
Hrenda-Roberts said.
   A leading pro-choice legislator, Republican state Sen. James
Greenwood, predicted that if provisions are challenged and upheld,
``Then the dam is open.''
   ``My instincts are that we are probably better off not having
this becoming the case to challenge Roe,'' Greenwood said. ``On the
other hand, I think it is inevitable that the Supreme Court will,
in one way or another, rule on all these matters. It's just a
matter of time.''

   Homeless protesters who had taken over an ornate
room of the Statehouse were arrested Wednesday shortly after saying
they would not be moved until $700,000 in budget cuts were restored
to the winter shelter program.
   The vigil, held in memory of one of their own who died after
spending a night on Boston Common last winter, ended with the
arrest of 20 people about an hour after it began.
   Leroy Van Valkenburg and more than 100 others moved into Nurses
Hall promising, ``I will not move.''
   All of those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct, said
Capitol Police Officer Kathleen Stapleton.
   Rich Kramer, an organizer, said bail was set at $25, and a $500
bail fund had been established to benefit any homeless people who
were arrested.
   Van Valkenburg, 51, has lived on the streets for 10 years. He's
survived 35-below zero nights on Boston Common, even after
suffering three heart attacks and a stroke.
   The event was held in memory of Tim Flynn, 32, a friend of Van
Valkenburg's who died last winter.
   Organizers of the event said the state provided $2.2 million to
make sure the homeless were sheltered last winter. But because of
the state's worsening fiscal status, only $1.5 million is available
this year.
   ``If the state can't provide for rescue, than we'll have to take
the space and make it available,'' said Jim Stewart, an activist
from Cambridge.
   Joe Landolfi, a spokesman for the office of Human Services, said
that regardless of the budget crunch,``nobody's going to be out on
the streets due to a lack of beds.''
   Van Valkenburg said he worked as a cook at two hotels for 20
years until 10 years ago when he was disabled. In addition to two
heart attacks, he suffered a stroke that left him partially
disabled and he relies on a brace to walk.
   Van Valkenburg receives about $100 a week in disability payments
from the state, but he can't accumulate enough to pay advance rent
and security for a room and still buy food.
   He relies on shelters in the cold months.
   The state's winter care program is designed to provide emergency
shelter during the colder months, according to Madeline Carhart of
the Executive Office of Human Services.
   But with funding down $700,000 from last year, Stewart and
Harris predict 200 fewer people will be able to find housing.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said Wednesday the United
States regards captialism as the best formula for curing the
economic problems of Eastern Europe but said ``we have not tried to
dictate it for any of these countries.''
   The statement came after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said the reforms in Eastern Europe do not spell the demise of
socialism and denounced calls for ``exporting capitalism'' to the
Soviet bloc.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater noted that the United
States has joined other Western countries in providing aid to
Poland and Hungary as they try to reform their economies into a
free-market system. ``But we don't think that's a conflict with the
concerns raised by President Gorbachev,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said President Bush views the United States'
free-market system ``as the pride of the world and as a good way to
reform the economic problems that they are facing. We certainly are
proud of the capitalist system and the rewards that it has offered.
   ``We hold it up as an example to all, but we have not tried to
dictate it for any of these countries,'' Fitzwater said.
   He added, ``We have no apologies or concern with anything that
we've done at this point.''
   Bush and Gorbachev will meet for a summit Dec. 2-3 on ships in
the Mediterranean off the coast of Malta. Fitzwater confirmed that
Bush is considering a stop in Brussels, Belgium, on the way home to
brief NATO allies on the talks.
   Fitzwater said he expected Bush and Gorbachev to make a
commitment to progress on reducing strategic nuclear stockpiles and
conventional arms in Europe. He stressed, however, that there would
be no major agreements, saying, ``We will not be counting throw
weights.''
   The press secretary acknowledged that the United States and
Soviet Union are trying to manipulate public expectations of the
summit's outcome.
   ``The Soviets ... have a tendency in past summits ... to build
expectations before a summit, and we have a tendency to play them
down,'' he said. ``I suspect the reality is somewhere in the
middle. But I would urge you to discount theirs a little bit on the
top side.''
   Fitzwater also said that despite prodding from Democrats, there
is ``no real consideration'' being given to the idea of Bush going
to the Berlin Wall to salute its opening.

   An East German political group said Wednesday it
would make the first direct challenge to Communist rule by asking
Parliament this week to end the party's 40-year-old monopoly on
power, and predicted an easy victory.
   Communist officials spurned West Germany's offer of an economic
bailout. They said they prefer their own course to recovery and
hinted at reforms to encourage free-enterprise investment.
   Bild, a mass-circulation West German newspaper, reported
Wednesday that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would meet with party chief
Egon Krenz after a Communist Party congress Dec. 15-17 that is
expected to make major changes in the East German leadership.
   In West Berlin, hundreds gathered at the enormous Brandenburg
Gate, hoping the East Germans would break through the Berlin Wall
in front of the 200-year-old ``symbol of unity.'' A West German
television network said up to 7,000 East German refugees were
expected to return to their homeland.
   The East German constitution's guarantee of a ``leading role''
for the Communist Party will be challenged at Friday's sitting of
the increasingly independent-minded Parliament, said Manfred
Gerlach, head of the Liberal Democratic Party.
   It was unclear whether a vote on the constitutional change would
come the same day.
   ``I figure it will pass with a large majority,'' Gerlach told
West Germany's ARD radio network. His party, once closely allied
with the Communists, has been at the forefront of calls for change
in East Germany.
   The new speaker of Parliament, non-Communist Guenther Maleuda,
on Tuesday urged a constitutional change to allow a true multiparty
government.
   The East German constitution specifies that constitutional
changes must be approved a majority of the lawmakers in the
500-member Parliament, or People's Chamber.
   Despite Gerlach's prediction, a majority of the chamber is still
believed to be made up of orthodox members likely to reject the
measure.
   Parliament, however, has shown increasing signs of independence,
engaging in once-unthinkable debates and casting 26 votes Oct. 24
against naming Krenz as president Oct. 24.
   For weeks, Gerlach has urged the Communists to abandon their
``leading role,'' but Friday's motion will be the first direct
challenge.
   Gerlach also predicted free elections as early as next year, and
said the Communists would fail to win a majority. Krenz has
promised free elections, but has not set a date.
   Krenz's leadership on Wednesday weighed the latest pledge of
economic aid from Bonn, offered in exchange for sweeping political
and economic reforms.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann on Tuesday
announced the offer of massive economic aid, which he likened to
the U.S. Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Western Europe after the
Nazi defeat in World War II.
   There was no formal government response from East Germany to
Haussmann's offer, but officials have made clear they do not favor
a full free-market system.
   The Communist-aligned National Democratic Party outlined
measures to attract private investment.
   Deputy Finance Minister Martin Maassen called for tax breaks for
East Germans who want to privately produce goods and services to
fill the nation's vast consumer void.
   East Germany's state-run newspapers printed doubtful comments on
the prospects for accepting handouts, declaring no interest in a
``sellout'' of their socialist state.
   Economist Karl-Heinz Arnold told the Communist Party newspaper
Berliner Zeitung that East Germany can manage its own recovery, an
indication that Bonn's offer may be rejected.
   The government-run Bauern-Echo newspaper, aimed at East
Germany's farmers, warned against too much influence from West
Germany.
   ``Yes to unrestricted travel. No to an East German sellout,''
the newspaper said. It deemed the two German states ``politically
and economically too diverse.''
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper cautioned against excessive West
German involvement in East German affairs.
   ``East Germany needs no patronage,'' Momper said in West Berlin.
   In Washington, a White House spokesman said the United States
has ``no apologies'' for extolling capitalism as a remedy for
Eastern Europe's economic woes. Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev had warned the West against gloating about the demise of
socialism or attempting to ``export capitalism.''
   ``We certainly are proud of the capitalist system and the
rewards that it has offered,'' Marlin Fitzwater said. ``We hold it
up as an example to all but we have not tried to dictate it to any
of these countries.''
   In Tokyo, Gorbachev adviser Alexander Yakovlev said he was
surprised by Western commentators who interpret the tumult in
Eastern Europe as demonstrating the failure of socialism and Soviet
policy.
   ``This is an obsolete, archaic way of thinking,'' said Yakovlev,
a Politburo member. ``We would like to have a common European house
based on freedom. If someone interferes in that process, we might
go back to the time of the Cold War. We are standing at such a
juncture.''
   West Germany's ZDF television network said Wednesday as many as
7,000 East Germans were expected to return home because they had
become disenchanted with life in the West. The East German Red
Cross has predicted 10,000 could return.
   Nearly 300,000 East Germans arrived for visits in the West in
the past 24 hours, West German border police said Wednesday. East
German authorities have issued 7.8 million visas in five days, or
nearly half of the 16.5 million population, the official ADN news
agency reported.

   Metropolitan Fiber Systems Inc. announced
Wednesday it has filed petitions with the Justice Department and
Federal Communications Commission to allow alternative
telecommunications carriers to compete for local telephone access
services.
   ``This action is a logical extension of historical regulatory
policy designed to generate competition in the telecommunications
industry,'' said Anthony J. Pompliano, president of MFS, which is
based in the Chicago suburb of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.
   Currently the regional Bell and other operating companies
provide local phone access for all long-distance carriers. Nearly
50 cents of every dollar spent on long-distance services goes to
the Bell companies for access fees, totaling about $20 billion a
year.
   Pompliano said his company was asking the Justice Department
``to enforce the Modified Final Judgment to require that local
access ... be `unbundled' to the fullest extent possible to permit
fair and equitable competition.''
   Also, he said, ``we are asking the FCC to mandate that
alternative local telecommunications carriers can cost-effectively
interconnect'' and locate equipment at Bell facilities.
   ``That means MFS and similar alternative carriers can install
their equipment in Bell-owned switch sites and hook up to the user
community via the Bell network,'' Pompliano said.
   Commenting on the announcement, A. Gray Collins, Bell Atlantic
senior vice president for external affairs, said: ``Metropolitan
Fiber is free to use Bell Atlantic's services any way it wants, and
it is free to connect its own network with Bell Atlantic's.''
   ``Metropolitan Fiber, however, is demanding more than this. It
is demanding collocation, which is, in effect, the ability to set
up their shop in our store. Bell Atlantic has no legal obligation
to do this, but it has agreed to meet a number of Metropolitan's
requests,'' Collins said.
   Bill McCloskey, a spokesman for BellSouth, said about the MFS
action: ``These petitions appear to propose more confusion in the
telephone industry. They do not appear to offer any new services
that residential customers might use'' but instead appear
``designed to benefit only high-volume users of specialized
business services.''
   Bob Jasinski, public relations manager for NYNEX, commented:
``The announcement by Metropolitan Fiber Systems simply confirms
the fact that there's growing competition in the telecommunications
markets served by the regional holding companies.''
   He added that ``NYNEX stands ready to consider any reasonable
requests for interconnection that will help ensure customer demands
are met.''
   MFS currently operates fiber optic communication networks in
Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, Minneapolis and San
Francisco, with networks in Los Angeles and Houston to be completed
by the end of this year. The company also is planning to construct
networks in Pittsburgh, Dallas, New York and Washington.
   Pompliano said ``the problem with having a single supplier
exclusively control the local access business is that the lack of
competition provides no incentive to be responsive to customer
needs, offer new services, or lower rates.''
   ``If alternative local telecommunications carriers like MFS are
allowed to offer access services, technology will improve ahead of
current projections and the rates for local access will drop,'' the
MFS chief said.

   ``... Here I stand before you, to speak to America in the name
of my nation, to speak to citizens of the country and the continent
whose threshhold is guarded by the famous Statue of Liberty. It is
for me an honor so great, a moment so solemn, that I can find
nothing to compare it with. The people of Poland link the name of
the United States with freedom and democracy, with generosity and
high-mindedness, with human friendship and friendly humanity. ...''
</TEXT>

   ``An unemployed man ... fired from my job for earlier attempts
to organize workers in the fight for their rights, I jumped over
the shipyard wall and rejoined by colleagues who promptly appointed
me the leader of the (Gdansk) strike. That's how it all began (nine
years ago). When I recall the road we have traveled, I often think
of that jump over the fence. Now, others jump fences and tear down
walls. They do it because freedom is a human right. ...''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Looking at what is happening around us today, we may state
positively that the Polish road of struggle for human rights,
struggle without violence, the Polish stubbornness and firmness in
the quest for pluralism and democracy, shows many people today, and
even nations, how to avoid the greater dangers. If there is
something threatening European stability, it certainly is not
Poland. ...''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Stalin forbade Poland to use aid provided by the Marshall
Plan, the aid that was used by everyone in Western Europe,
including countries which lost the war. It is worth recalling this
great American plan which helped Western Europe to protect its
freedom and peaceful order. And now it is the moment when Eastern
Europe awaits an investment of this kind _ an investment in
freedom, democracy and peace _ an investment adequate to the
greatness of the American nation. ...''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``On our path there looms a serious obstacle, a grave danger.
Our long subjection to a political system incompatible with
national traditions, to a system of economy incompatible with
rationality and common sense, coupled with the stifling of
independent thought and disregard for national interests. All this
has led the Polish economy to ruin, to the verge of utter
catastrophe. ...''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Today, all the countries of the Eastern Bloc are bankrupt. The
communist economy has failed in every part of the world. ... And
Poland entered this new road and will never be turned back. ...''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``We know that America has her own problems and difficulties,
some of them very serious. We are not asking for charity or
expecting philanthropy. But we would like to see our country
treated as a partner and friend. We would like cooperation under
decent and favorable conditions. We would like Americans to come to
us with proposals of cooperation bringing benefits to both sides.
... We believe that assistance extended to democracy and freedom
and Poland and all of Eastern Europe is the best investment in the
future and in peace, better than tanks, warships and warplanes, an
investment leading to greater security. ...''

   ``The decision by the Congress of the United States about
granting economic aid to Poland opens a new road. For this
wonderful decision, I thank you warmly. I promise you that this aid
will not be wasted and will never be forgotten. ...''

   New windows with thick bullet-proof glass were

part of efforts to tighten his security, officials said Wednesday.
   The replacement of existing windows with bullet-proof glass,
completed last week, cost $73,000, the department said.
   Security for the attorney general has been noticeably tighter
since Colombia's crackdown on drug lords, which prompted threats
from cocaine traffickers to kill U.S. officials.
   The attorney general now travels in an armor-plated limousine
that cost more than $100,000.
   Thornburgh no longer uses the public entrance to his office at
the Justice Department, leaving instead by a variety of routes.
   The handful of FBI agents in Thornburgh's security detail have
recently been spotted carrying gun cases, indicated they are now
armed with high-powered weapons.

<HEAD>Bill Would Force States To Suspend Driver's Licenses Of Drug Abusers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top federal highway official asked
Congress Wednesday not to pass a bill that would compel states to
suspend driver's licenses of convicted drug abusers.
   Federal Highway Administrator Thomas D. Larson asked a Senate
subcommittee to defer action on the proposal until more is known
about its legal implications.
   The bill would withhold a portion of federal highway funds from
states that do not pass such laws.
   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, called the measure ``legalized
blackmail'' and said it would unduly extend the reach of the
federal government. But Symms later said he was keeping an open
mind because of his support for the goals of the bill.
   Its chief sponsor, Sen. Frank L. Lautenberg, D-N.J., said the
measure would discourage drug use, particularly among young people,
and make highways safer.
   ``Driving is a privilege, not a right,'' Lautenberg said. ``And
if a citizen chooses to engage in illegal drug behavior, he or she
should lose that privilege.''
   Larson said about half the states already have laws that allow
suspension or revokation of driving privileges upon conviction for
a drug offense, although most do not make such action mandatory.
   He said a law that suspends a driver's license for sex offenses
was thrown out by the Illinois Supreme Court. Some states have had
difficulty tracking down drivers to obtain their suspended
licenses, particularly in large urban areas, Larson said.
   ``While we support the goals of the program,'' Larson said, ``we
believe that more time may be helpful to consider the many complex
issues involved.''
   Lt. Robert Robbins, a New Jersey police officer speaking for the
Fraternal Order of Police, said the group supports the bill but has
reservations about its possible impact in states where the loss of
federal funds might affect money going to police departments. He
said rules are needed to prevent this.
   New Jersey Attorney General Peter N. Perretti said state
officials believe their law that suspends driver's licenses has
discouraged drug use among youths and middle-class offenders.
   ``Suspension of a driver's license is the most effective
deterent next to jail,'' Perretti told the subcommittee.

   A bomb ripped through a car
traveling on a rural highway in County Tyrone Wednesday, killing
the driver, police said.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility in a statement
issued to local media and alleged that the victim, a businessman,
worked for the British province's security forces.
   Police denied he had any connection with the security forces.
   The man, whose name was not released, was driving on the highway
between Dungannon and Ballygawley, about 8 miles from the
province's border with the Irish Republic, when a 2-pound bomb
hidden under the car detonated, a police spokesman said.
   The explosion blew the roof off the car, which burst into
flames, the spokesman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British out of Northern Ireland
and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   Earlier, several hundred Protestant demonstrators marked the
fourth anniversary of the signing of the Anglo-Irish agreement by
linking hands along main roads in different parts of the province.
Organizers had predicted a turnout of 300,000 people.
   ``I recognize that the imaginative scheme did not capture the
imagination of the Ulster people,'' said an organizer, the Rev.
Martin Smyth, a legislator in the British Parliament.
   Organizers blamed the low turnout partly on the absence of two
Protestant leaders, the Rev. Ian Paisley who is visiting Australia
and James Molyneaux who was lobbying fellow British legislators in
London.
   The 1985 agreement between Britain and Ireland gave the Irish
government a consultative role in the affairs of Northern Ireland
for the first time.
   It set up a permanent secretariat of British and Irish civil
servants in Belfast to deal with the grievances the Catholic
minority claim they suffer under the Protestant majority.
   The agreement also pledged cooperation between the two countries
on security measures along their common border.

   Maine hospitals, facing the strictest
anti-smoking law in the nation, are ready to hand out carrot
sticks, popcorn and advice on going cold turkey as they comply with
the new law Thursday.
   Some hospitals have imposed smoking bans already, and others,
including the state's largest, are adopting policies stricter than
the new state law, which takes effect on the American Cancer
Society's Great American Smokeout.
   As they kick smokers outside, many of the hospitals are offering
programs to employees who are inspired to quit.
   At the Osteopathic Hospital of Maine in Portland, the staff
plans to hand out carrot sticks, popcorn and crossword puzzles to
help patients get through the day without their smokes, said
spokeswoan Linda Frechette.
   The hospital will also operate a telephone help line for staff
and patients, Frechette said. Respiratory therapists will visit
patients and give advice on how to break the habit.
   The law, supported by a coalition of health groups and the Maine
Hospital Association, bars smoking by patients, staff and visitors
in all hospitals, including the state's two psychiatric facilities.
   Exceptions are allowed only when a patient receives written
permission from a doctor, and in such cases the smoking must be
done in a designated area away from other patients.
   Laws with exceptions similar to Maine's will take effect in
January in Minnesota and Maryland, said Lynn Jones of the American
Hospital Association. A less restrictive law allowing smoking in
some ventilated areas is in effect in Michigan.
   As many as half of Maine's 43 hospitals had no-smoking policies
prior to the new law, said James Harnar of the Maine Hospital
Association.
   Down East Community Hospital in Machias, which imposed its
policy at midnight Sunday, is banning smoking even with doctors'
permission, said chief executive officer George Avery.
   So far, the ban appears to have been ``relatively calmly
accepted,'' said Avery, who has also noticed that the rule has
induced some staff members to kick the habit.
   ``You almost sense this gratitude thing'' among those employees,
said Avery.
   At Eastern Maine Medical Center's psychiatric unit, an exception
for all patients is being issued, said Jeffre Witherly, a spokesman
for the Bangor hospital. He explained that the doctor in charge of
the unit believes smoking may be ``vital to each patient's care.''
   Smoking in the rest of the hospital is banned, except in cases
where ``compassionate use'' is allowed by a doctor. Witherly said
patients receiving exceptions might include those with terminal
illnesses.
   The Augusta Mental Health Institute has been gradually reducing
smoking hours for three months and will be virtually smoke-free
Thursday, said William Meyer, superindendent of the state-run
psychiatric hospital.
   Fruit and juices that can be alternatives for smoking will be
offered, along with group talks and support for those quitting,
said Meyer. He expects a few exceptions to be permitted, and only
in the admissions unit.
   ``It's not going down well with everybody,'' said Meyer, adding
that patients who continue to smoke will have to go outside.
   Dr. George Dreher, medical director of chemical dependency
rehabilitation at St. Mary's Hospital in Lewiston, said he believes
most doctors will only be persuaded to grant exceptions under the
most compelling circumstances. He predicted that ``over time the
number of exceptions is going to decline.''

<HEAD>Cabinet Ministers Meet on Egyptian Exodus from Iraq</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cabinet ministers made plans Wednesday for
bringing order to the return of about 3,000 Egyptian workers a day
from Iraq and an official said they leaving for economic reasons,
not because of maltreatment.
   In Baghdad, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq called a meeting of
Egyptian residents and complained about Cairo newspaper reports
that the workers were being mistreated.
   He promised to investigate any complaints, but discounted claims
that many Egyptians have been killed maliciously in Iraq. He said
they died naturally or from violence in numbers understandable in a
group of about 2 million people.
   Rumors circulated Wednesday among diplomats in Cairo that Nabil
Najm, the Iraqi ambassador, had received a death threat. Embassy
spokesman Daoud Farhan denied the reports and said the ambassador
was not in Egypt.
   Ahmed Radwan, secretary-general of President Hosni Mubarak's
cabinet, said the ministers were told the main reason Egyptians
were returning was that new fiscal rules in Iraq reduced the amount
of money alien workers could send home.
   He said Ibrahim Ouf, Egyptian ambassador in Baghdad, told the
ministers a manpower surplus had resulted from Iraq's
demobilization after the truce agreement of August 1988 in the
8-year-old war with Iran.
   Ouf said Iraqi employers were dismissing Egyptians and giving
their jobs to former Iraqi soldiers, according to Radwan.
   The Cabinet official did not address reports by the newspaper
Al-Akhbar that more than 100 Egyptian corpses were returned from
Iraq in October, compared to an average of two or three in other
months.
   He did say, however, that Ouf told the ministers Iraqi
authorities were prepared to present complete files on Egyptians
who die in Iraq.
   Al-Akhbar has reported that Iraqi death certificates attributed
most of the Egyptian deaths to violent causes.
   On Wednesday, it said five bodies of Egyptian men aged 23-40
arrived at the Cairo airport the day before with documents
indicating two died of skull fractures, one of burns and one of
heart failure. Al-Akhbar said the cause of the fifth death was not
determined.
   Radwan's comments were distributed by the official Middle East
News Agency. He said the ministerial group was headed by Prime
Minister Atef Sedki and including the foreign, finance, labor,
immigration, supplies and administrative affairs ministers, the
head of the Civil Aviation Authority and Ambassador Ouf.
   Tens of thousands of Egyptians are said to be awaiting
transportation from Iraq. The departures began soon after Iraq
issued new regulations Oct. 1 on sending money home.
   Sedki and Taha Yassin Ramadan, deputy prime minister, are to
discuss the situation Saturday in Cairo.
   Authorities at Cairo airport said 25,000-27,000 Egyptian workers
arrived past week on Egyptian and Iraqi airliners.
   They said both airlines had increased their number of flights to
handle the traffic.

<HEAD>Ex-Envoy Discusses China's `Great Leap Backward'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winston Lord, a former U.S. ambassador to
China, told Congress on Wednesday that China is making ``a great
leap backward'' and said the United States should withold full
cooperation until a new, more democratic regime is in place in
Beijing.
   Lord told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that it likely
will take several years before China reverses the course it
embarked upon when it brutally cracked down on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing's Tianamen Square.
   Until such a reversal, he said, ``we must both sustain our
condemnation of Beijing's actions and preserve the framework for
future cooperation when China's big chill is lifted.
   ``For us to resume full cooperation will require a new regime in
Beijing,'' he said.
   Lord, who was ambassaddor in Beijing from November 1985 to last
April, said he had been reluctant to comment on China's problems
until the crackdown in June.
   ``Such inhibitions have been swept away as Beijing's leaders
proceded from intransigence to massacre to executions to
repression, roundups, purges, disappearances, harassment,
surveilance, Orwellian groupthink, rollback of reforms and extreme
xenophobia _ all cloaked in a particularly brazen display of the
Big Lie,'' he said.
   ``Since June the trends have been bleak indeed as China seems to
be making a great leap backward to the 1950's and 1960's,'' Lord
said.
   In this period, he said, the loyalty of the United States
``should be to the Chinese people and the Chinese officials _ some
deposed, many still in office _ who deplore such policies and not
to the handful responsible for crushing Chinese spirits.''
   The United States should do nothing, he said, to break the web
of relationships that have been built since the United States
normalized relations with China.
   ``We cannot rip out all of these roots that we have so carefully
nutured,'' he said. ``We must preserve the foundations for the time
when a more cooperative relationship with China is once again
possible.''
   Above all, he said, the United States must realize that ``the
Chinese are responsible for the current impasse and it is up to
them to break it.''

   University of California researchers said
Wednesday they have found that implanting genetically altered skin
cells in the brains of rats can reduce symptoms of Parkinson's
disease.
   The study was the first to report behavioral effects from
genetically modified cells grafted onto the brain, the scientists
said.
   The research does not portend a cure for Parkinson's and is not
ready for human testing, but it may offer a possible alternative to
fetal cell implants, which have proved effective against the
disease but which have become mired in political and ethical
controversy, they said.
   ``We have to see if we can increase the effects we've seen,''
which are not as significant as the effects observed when fetal
cells are transplanted, said Fred Gage, a neuroscientist at the
university in San Diego.
   In their study, the scientists genetically altered skin cells of
the rats to make them produce L-dopa, a chemical that is lacking in
the brains of Parkinson's disease patients.
   When these cells were transplanted into the rats' brains, where
lesions had been induced to cause neurological abonormalities
mimicing Parkinson's disease, an average 40 percent reduction in
abnormal behavior was seen, Gage said in a telephone interview.
   The results of the study, conducted by Gage and colleagues at
the University of California at San Diego, including Dr. Theodore
Friedmann, a pioneer in the development of genetically modified
cells, were to be published in the latest issue of Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences.
   An estimated 400,000 people in the United States suffer from
Parkinson's disease, a nerve disorder characterized by trembling,
muscle rigidity and difficulty walking and balancing.
   In the study, the scientists monitored general motor impairment
in the rats and specifically rotational behavior in which the rats
walk in circles as a result of their neurological damage.
   Gage said that fetal cell implants can reverse this disability
100 percent, while the genetically altered skin cells were only
partially successful.
   ``As it stands right now, it's nowhere near as effective as
fetal tissue,'' Gage said.
   However, ``this new approach offers a possible alternative,''
considering the current limitations on fetal tissue research, he
said.
   The Bush administration earlier this month extended indefinitely
a ban on federal financing of research in which human fetal tissue
from induced abortions is transplanted into human patients.
   Gage said the technique studied represents a merging of two
technologies, transplantation and gene transfer, to create
genetically modified cells that produce chemicals secreted in the
brain to restore behavioral function.
   The researchers took skin cells from rats and inserted genes to
produce an enzyme called tyrosine hydroxylase, which serves as a
catalyst to make the cell produce L-dopa. These L-dopa-producing
cells were then grafted into the brains of rats.
   Gage said that because the skin cells can be taken from the same
rat into which the modified cells are implanted, the chances of
immunological rejection can be decreased. Also, ``by it's very
nature, this sidesteps the fetal tissue issue,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Congressmen Question Archives-Cigarette Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two members of Congress on Wednesday called
for investigation of an agreement between a cigarette manufacturer
and the National Archives to sponsor a campaign commemorating the
200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights.
   ``Philip Morris has bought the exclusive rights to the
Constitution which we entrusted to the National Archives, for the
modern equivalent of 30 pieces of silver or $600,000,'' said Rep.
Thomas A. Luken, in a statement announcing a congressional hearing
on Thursday.
   The Ohio Democrat heads the House subcommittee on transportation
and hazardous materials, which has jurisdictin over advertising and
the Federal Trade Commission.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., asked the General Accounting Office,
the investigative arm of Congress, to look into the matter.
   The Health Research Group, a consumer organization, wrote Sen.
Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., last week asking Congress to revoke the
agreement. Bingaman has written Don Wilson, the archivist of the
United States, questioning how and why the agreement was made.
   The two-year agreement, signed in August, makes Philip Morris
Companies, Inc., the nation's largest cigarette maker, a part of
the official National Archives bicentennial celebration of the Bill
of Rights.
   In a ``memorandum of understanding'' Philip Morris agreed to
donate $600,000 to the Archives trust fund in exchange for being
allowed to publish or broadcast announcements and promotional
materials commemorating the bicentennial and referring to the
Archives.
   Critics have questioned whether the broadcast announcements
constitute cigarette advertisements on radio and television, which
was banned by the federal government in 1971.
   ``The Philip Morris ads are running on television and do not
contain any health warning and apparently are a fragrant violation
of the law prohibiting such video commercials,'' said Luken.
   Guy L. Smith, Philip Morris' vice president of corporate
affairs, said he didn't believe the company's announcements
violated the advertising ban since ``there is no cigarette called
Philip Morris.''
   ``In the same week that the Berlin Wall is being torn down that
people in this country are being criticized for celebrating the
Bill of Rights is very strange,'' Smith added in a reference to
recent events in East Germany.
   The company plans to continue the campaign and send a
representative to testify at Thursday's hearing, he said.
   Critics also have questioned corporate sponsorship of Archives
programs.
   Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group, criticized
the ``commercialization of space in the building which houses the
symbols of our nation.''
   Congress not only permitted the agency to accept tax-exempt
donations to its trust fund but also specifically ``encouraged it
to do so in order to enhance it's archival and outreach
activities,'' said Susan Cooper, spokeswoman for the Archives.
   While this the first large corporate donation to the Archives
trust fund, Cooper said, it is not the first cooperative effort
with private industry.
   In addition, she said Philip Morris' sponsorship of an exhibit
in the Archives building is no different than when other companies
underwrote receptions to celebrate the bicentenial of the
Constitution or when Philip Morris itself sponsored exhibits at the
National Art Gallery.

   Palestinians set off
fireworks, danced, flew outlawed flags and launched balloons
Wednesday, the first anniversary of the PLO declaration of their
independence.
   Many celebrations in the occupied lands were peaceful, but Arab
reports said at least 19 Palestinians were wounded or beaten by
soldiers reacting to stone-throwing attacks. An Israeli man was
reported injured in a stoning incident.
   Also Wednesday, a 40-year-old Israeli reservist died of head
wounds suffered in an ambush Monday by Palestinians in the occupied
Gaza Strip, the military command said.
   Zeev Traum became the second soldier to die in the attack and
the 42nd Israeli to die in the nearly two-year-old Palestinian
revolt. At least 615 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers or civilians.
   Soldiers curtailed many festivities by imposing round-the-clock
curfews that confined nearly 500,000 Palestinians to their homes
and banned travel to and from the Gaza Strip for a second straight
day.
   The celebrations marked the anniversary of the declaration of an
independent Palestinian state on Nov. 15, 1988, during a meeting of
the Palestine National Council in Algiers. The council acts as the
legislature of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Young Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza gave up
stone-throwing for the day and Israeli soldiers also used
restraint, keeping away from dozens of marches and rallies like
those held in this hilltop town of 3,500 people 20 miles north of
Jerusalem.
   Several Israeli newspapers said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
told a closed parliament committee session he had information that
leaders of the 23-month-old Palestinian uprising had ordered
increased use of firearms to attack soldiers.
   The PLO has directed that firearms not be used. The most common
weapons are stones and firebombs.
   Whatever the PLO orders, there was a call to arms during a rally
in Mazraa Asharkiya.
   ``We congratulate our people today and we promise you to
continue our struggle! With the gun we will achieve our
independence; only with the gun!'' a young man in a ``popular
army'' khaki uniform, masked with an Arab head scarf, shouted
through a megaphone.
   He was applauded by about 1,000 men and women in the main square
and on rooftops holding balloons and Palestinian flags, which
Israel has outlawed.
   Many adults clapped rhythmically and children sang the
Palestinian anthem ``Biladi, Biladi,'' Arabic for ``My Country, My
Country.''
   From the crowd came chants of ``Don't be afraid, don't be
afraid, the stone will become a Kalashnikov,'' a Soviet-designed
automatic rifle.
   About 150 uniformed youths later marched streets of the village,
past houses adorned with photographs of PLO chief Yasser Arafat,
and Palestinian guerrilla leaders Nayef Hawatmeh and George Habash.
   Young men daubed ``Let's burn the land under the feet of
occupation'' on walls.
   Israeli soldiers manned a checkpoint outside Mazraa Asharkiya
but did not intervene. An army helicopter clattered overhead.
   Observances were held in other towns, including Nablus, the
largest in the West Bank. Dozens of masked youths defied an army
curfew in Nablus by lighting torches and shouting: ``With blood and
soul, we will redeem Palestine!''
   Balloons in the red, green, white and black of the Palestinian
flag hovered over rooftops. A huge red balloon attached to a flag
was emblazoned with: ``The independent Palestinian state lives on.''
   At Jebel Mukhaber village in the Jerusalem district, children
holding balloons marched to a drum beat until riot police dispersed
them.
   Youths in Yatta, near Hebron, danced the Arabic ``debka,'' beat
drums and waved Palestinian flags.
   Jerusalem police fired tear gas to disperse Palestinians who
hurled stones during a march by 200 doctors, nurses and patients
outside a hospital on the Mount of Olives.
   The Palestinian casualties were reported in several Gaza City
neighborhoods and refugee camps. Arab reports said three were
injured by rubber bullets or beatings and the others were shot.

   Two farms near Boone, Iowa, are in friendly
competition to test the merits of low-input methods against more
traditional ways of producing crops, the Agriculture Department
said Wednesday.
   Information will be gathered by USDA scientists over a number of
years to help determine which kind of farming is superior, said the
department's Agricultural Research Service. The study began last
spring, and results of the 1989 harvest are being analyzed now.
   Jerry L. Hatfield of the USDA agency said the Iowa project is
``one of the first studies to combine basic scientific studies with
an economic analysis.''
   Two adjacent 40-acre fields are being used, he said. One is part
of a 300-acre private research farm that belongs to Dick and Sharon
Thompson, longtime advocates of low-input, sustainable agriculture
designed to maintain the environment as well as the farm.
   Except for a few experimental plots, the Thompsons have used no
pesticides or commercial nitrogen fertilizer on the land since
1967. Crop rotations are used, including corn, soybeans, oats and
hay.
   The adjacent field is part of 1,400 acres of corn and soybeans
farmed by David Snyder with minimum fall tillage. He has rotated
corn and soybean crops on his land for at least 15 years. Snyder
uses pesticides and commercial fertilizers ``judiciously,'' the
report said.

   The Navy's top safety officer on Wednesday
compared a two-day safety stand-down to a timeout in an athletic
contest called to ``review the game plan and get back to the
basics.''
   The exercise is a useful tool, said Capt. Ferguson Norton, chief
of the Naval Safety Center. The stand-down ordered Tuesday is the
most widespread in memory, he said.
   It was ordered after a rash of 10 accidents in the last three
weeks killed 10 people and injured 71.
   All Navy units will spend 48 of 72 hours this week reviewing
procedures and training, looking at the work environment, and
reminding all hands of safety measures, according to the stand-down
ordered by Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett III and Adm.
Carlisle A.H. Trost, chief of naval operations.
   ``A timeout also can be called to halt the momentum of the
opponent, ... in this case, the string of mishaps,'' Norton said at
a news conference.
   The safety center analyzes all Navy accidents worldwide in an
attempt to prevent further problems.
   ``Safety is the product of sound operating procedures and good
training,'' Norton said.
   ``We want to leave no stone unturned to ensure that safety is
uppermost in the minds of all hands, at all times,'' said Lt. Cmdr.
Steve Burnett, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet.
   Norton said the Navy's record of safety has been steadily
improving over recent years.
   There were 118 major problems during operations in 1984. That
figure has dropped to 69 so far this year, according to Navy
figures.
   However, the number of fatalities for 1984 was 64; 102 sailors
have been killed so far this year, including 47 in the April 19th
gun turret explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa.
   Norton said the center's analysis found no clear links between
accidents of the last three weeks. He also said there was no
indication that Pentagon budget cuts had any effect on accidents.
   ``We're got a tough business. ... We're expected to be able to
go tomorrow anywhere in the world and be an instrument of national
policy. That's what the government expects and that's what the
American people expect,'' Norton said.
   Meanwhile, personnel at the Norfolk Naval Station spent the day
preparing for the stand-down.
   ``Most of the units did not find out about the stand-down until
late yesterday. The 72-hour window gives them time to plan the
rotations and wind down any missions they are on,'' Burnett said.
   Burnett said Atlantic Fleet ships at sea will not be called home
for the safety drill.
   ``Ships at sea will stand-down at sea. Those on shore will do
their stand-down there.''
   The most serious of the recent accidents occurred Oct. 29 when a
jet pilot making his first landing on an aircraft carrier crashed
into the USS Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico. he pilot and four
others were killed.
   On Monday, the destroyer USS Kinkaid and a freighter collided in
the Malacca Strait killing one Navy crewman, injuring five, and
starting fires on both vessels.
   Last Thursday, a Navy reserve pilot flying an A-7E jet crashed
into an apartment complex in Smyrna, Ga., killing two civilians and
injuring two others, including himself.

<HEAD>1000s of Colombian Judges, Court Workers Return to Work</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Colombian judges and court
workers ended a two-week strike Wednesday after the government
promised to increase security for judges threatened by drug
traffickers.
   Justice Minister Roberto Salazar said in a meeting with union
representatives that beginning next week, the government would
start providing the judges with bulletproof vests, armored cars and
bodyguards, a union representative said.
   The strike by the National Association of Court Workers involved
about 5,000 judges and 12,000 court workers.
   Salazar also pledged that the offices of certain judges would be
moved to government buildings offering more security, said Consuelo
Herrera, a union board member.
   ``Some judges' offices are located in extremely dangerous
neighborhoods,'' Mrs. Herrera said. ``These are the ones that will
be moved.''
   She said the union was satisfied with the government's promises
but that their quick implementation was vital to keeping the courts
open.
   ``If the government does not act quickly to put the measures in
place, the union will call another strike,'' Mrs. Herrera said in a
telephone interview.
   The judges say the measures are necessary to prevent the
decimation of their ranks by drug traffickers retaliating for a
government crackdown on the country's cocaine cartels.
   The latest strike began Nov. 2, one day after a federal judge
was shot and killed in Medellin, the hub of Colombia's cocaine
trade. No one claimed responsibility for the killing, but
authorities have blamed traffickers.
   Three judges have been killed in the last three months, all
presumably by drug traffickers.
   President Virgilio Barco declared war on traffickers after they
assassinated a leading presidential candidate on Aug. 18. Six
Colombian drug suspects have been extradited to the United States
as part of the campaign.
   A terrorist group linked to the Medellin cartel has promised to
kill 10 judges for every trafficker extradited.
   The United States Wednesday announced it had provided additional
aid for Colombia's judges. The U.S. Embassy in Bogota said in a
communique that it had delivered to the Colombian government 300
bulletproof vests, 12 bullet-resistant cars, 12 metal detectors and
$500,000 for the purchase of other security equipment.
   Another load of weapons, munitions and security equipment for
judges reportedly arrived in the capital aboard a Hercules cargo
plane sent from Britain. A British Embassy spokeswoman, Mary de
Castello, said the embassy could neither confirm nor deny a radio
report of the donation.
   Judges returning to work must face a huge backlog of criminal
cases made even bigger by the two-week strike. Before the strike
ended, prison officials had begun to release some prisoners because
they could no longer detain them without setting a trial date.
   The government has also promised to review possible salary
increases for the judges, who currently make about $400 a month.

   A non-communist Cambodian rebel leader
said Wednesday the men who led the brutal Khmer Rouge government
more than a decade ago should accept exile in China to quiet fears
that they will return to power.
   Son Sann, whose guerrillas are technically allied with the Khmer
Rouge, addressed a news conference on the first day of the annual
General Assembly debate on Cambodia.
   ``I invite Pol Pot and all other Khmer Rouge leaders who
committed great crimes to prepare for their future in a pagoda in
China,'' he said.
   He referred to reports that China, embarrassed by Pol Pot's
record, would offer him and his colleagues refuge, thus eliminating
a major obstacle to a Cambodian settlement.
   ``If you disarm and Khmer Rouge and all parties and let people
vote, they are not going to vote for the Khmer Rouge,'' Son Sann
told the reporters.
   Pol Pot led the Khmer Rouge government that took over Cambodia
in April 1975 and killed or starved hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians before it was ousted by the Vietnamese invasion of
December 1978. The Khmer Rouge now is the strongest fighting force
in the alliance of three guerrilla groups.
   Addressing the General Assembly on behalf of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the former Cambodian ruler who leads the alliance, Son
Sann accused Vietnam of trying to divert attention from what the
rebels claim is its continued presence in Cambodia by focusing on
the Khmer Rouge threat.
   Vietnam says all its soldiers were withdrawn from Cambodia by
the end of September, but the guerrilla alliance claims more than 1
million remain, disguised as Cambodian troops and settlers.
   Son Sann denounced Hanoi for rejecting U.N. supervision and
verification of the withdrawal.
   ``In order to divert the international community from the
subterfuge of `total withdrawal,' Vietnam continues to brandish the
threat of the return of the Khmer Rouge to power,'' he said.
   ``It keeps rejecting all effective and impartial measures to
control its so-called total withdrawal and maintaining at all cost
the regime it has installed in Phnom Penh.''
   He suggested a U.N. presence in Cambodia for five to 10 years to
help safeguard civil rights, verify disarmament of the fighting
groups and make sure the Khmer Rouge did not return to power.
   Vietnamese Ambassador Trinh Xuan Lang said the two major issues
in Cambodia were Vietnamese withdrawal and keeping the Khmer Rouge
out of power.
   All the Vietnamese were gone, he declared, and ``the remaining
key issue is the need to prevent the Pol Pot clique from waging
civil war and re-establishing their genocidal regime in Cambodia.''
   This is the 11th annual General Assembly debate since the
Vietnamese invasion. Members are expected to give overwhelming
approval to a resolution for a comprehensive political settlement
and U.N. validation of the Vietnamese withdrawal.
   The United Nations recognizes the resistance alliance as
Cambodia's legitimate government.

<HEAD>U.N. Passes 1st Joint US-Soviet `Peace and Security' Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Assembly on Wednesday passed
an unprecedented joint U.S.-Soviet resolution urging nations to
settle conflicts peacefully and respect human rights.
   Although the resolution passed unanimously, Japan and Brazil
expressed unease over whether the superpowers might use their new
spirit of cooperation to stifle debate on issues not high on their
agenda.
   Japan's Ambassador Hideo Kagami said: ``Any part of this
resolution must not be interpreted to justify undue politicization
of issues of the United Nations under the name of peace and
security.''
   Brazil's Ambassador Paulo Nogueira-Batista pointed out that the
resolution stressed the role of the Security Council and General
Assembly, but failed to mention the Economic and Social Council,
which sets policy on social matters such as the environment, AIDS,
and the anti-drug fight.
   Brazil and Japan both joined in the consensus on the resolution,
however.
   The resolution urges all nations to obey the U.N. Charter and
use U.N. bodies to settle disputes, but offers no specific
proposals to end conflicts in Central America, Afghanistan,
Cambodia or elsewhere.
   It calls on all nations to ``respect the principles of sovereign
equality, political independence and territorial integrity of
states, and non-intervention in foreign affairs.''
   It also calls on nations to ``refrain from the threat or use of
force inconsistent with the charter,'' which permits only
self-defense, and to ``peacefully settle disputes.''
   Nations should ``adhere to the principles of equal rights and
self-determination of peoples, respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms, cooperation among states.''
   General Assembly resolutions have no binding effect on nations,
but the superpowers have the ability to persuade their allies to
resolve disputes peacefully when they wish.
   Earlier this month, at a joint U.S.-Soviet news conference,
Assistant Secretary of State John Bolton stressed that the
resolution puts an end to the superpower rivalry that prevailed
during the Cold War years.
   ``Today, it is an end to confrontation,'' said his Soviet
counterpart, Vladimir Petrovsky.

   President Bush declared on Wednesday that his
summit with Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will not be a
meeting ``to negotiate the future of Europe.''
   ``Only free and unfettered elections can satisfy the yearnings
of free people,'' Bush told the AFL-CIO. He praised the labor
movement for being the spark that ignited the fires of freedom in
Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   ``At Malta, I will work to advance (the) progress of reform and
democracy,'' he said. ``Everywhere you look in the world, members
of the AFL-CIO are fighting to keep the door to freedom open for
all.''
   Bush, saying ``let us join hands,'' also used the occasion of
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's triumphant visit on Wednesday to
propose to the AFL-CIO a ``parternship for progress'' to help
Poland restructure its economy.
   Steering clear of issues that have divided his administration
and organized labor, Bush asserted that doors that the labor union
helped to unlock throughout Eastern Europe ``cannot be locked
again.''
   He also told the 14.1 million-member federation's biennial
convention that he would discuss the importance of trade unions in
``building a free country'' in his Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit in
Malta with Gorbachev.
   Bush asserted that he and Gorbachev ``are not meeting to
negotiate the future of Europe. The peoples of Eastern Europe are
speaking their own minds about that future. They are calling for
democracy.''
   Bush's comments came as Gorbachev reaffirmed his opposition to
German reunification and criticized westerners who suggested
socialism had failed.
   Bush lavished warm praise on Walesa _ who was present as the
president spoke and who received enthusiastic applause when his
presence was noted _ as ``labor's son and democracy's advocate.''
   The president told his audience: ``you and I may have
differences.'' But, he said, ``there are times when the need for
progress demands that we put differences aside. Where Poland is
concerend, now is such a time.''
   The AFL-CIO has been critical of Bush's policies and those of
his predecessor. In fact, former President Reagan did not address
the labor federation in his eight years in office.'
   Bush was applauded during his speech, but afterward chants of
``sign the bill, sign the bill'' rang out throughout the standing
audience. Labor is awaiting Bush's decision on a bill to authorize
a congressional investigation of the eight-month Eastern Airlines
strike, and a large banner urging him to ``sign the Eastern bill''
was displayed in the hall.
   Another bill _ one raising the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.25
an hour by April 1991 _ is also awaiting Bush's signture.
   However, the fate o that legislation is not in doubt, since the
White House helped negotiate the final version with labor and
congressional leaders.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said earlier in the day
that Bush would sign the minimum wage bill, but that a time for the
signing had not yet been decided.
   Even before Bush took his term at the podium, Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the president's outspoken
support of Solidarity hypocritical, claiming Bush had worked to
undermine the powers of U.S. unions.
   ``It's ironic that so many who are willing to honor the
Solidarity union of Poland are so hostile to the unions of
America,'' Mitchell told 800 delegates and another several hundred
guests at the convention.
   However, Bush's praise of Walesa, who addressed the group the
day before, was enthusiastically received.
   Bush said he was calling on the labor movement, the business
community and government ``to look for ways to support a
partnership for progress in Poland...Labor, business and government
can and should be partners and activisits for Poland's future.''
   Bush did not spell out any specifics. However, he noted that he
and Walesa had discussed the importance of increased U.S.
investment in Poland.
   Bush added that, while he was pleased with Tuesday's
announcement of freedom of travel in Czechoslovakia, ``in that
country, where the tradition of democracy runs deep _ and in
others, freedom of travel is not enough.''
   ``Change has a way of sweeping through like a fast-moving train.
No one _ and no government _ should stand in the way.''
   At the same time, Bush said that he had asked AFL-CIO President
Lane Kirkland, who recently referred to the president as ``Reagan
Lite,'' to be part of a delegation that will go to Poland Nov. 28
-Dec. 2 to help Poland restructure its economy.
   Congress is nearing final approval of a package of about $800
million in economic aid for Poland and Hungary, steps that have the
backing of the administration.
   In accusing Bush of trying to weaken U.S. unions, Mitchell in
particular cited Bush's refusal to intervene and block the
8-months-old Eastern Airlines strike. Bush has refused to use his
power to name an emergency mediation board.
   ``They're all for labor unions as long as they are in Poland or
some other country, anywhere but the United States,'' Mitchell said.
   Labor is awaiting word on whether Bush will sign a measure
calling for a congressional study of the Eastern strike designed to
produce recommendations for a settlement.
   ``If he can't do that (sign the bill) I don't think labor can
expect too much from him,'' said Susan Bianchi-Sand, president of
the Association of Flight Attendants and newly elected member of
the federation's governing Executive Council. ``I don't hold out
hope that will sign it.''
   Kirkland, meanwhile, was unanimously re-elected to a sixth-two
year term. Thomas Donahue was the unanimous choice to continue as
the federation's secretary

   Here is a summary of major provisions in the
pay raise and ethics reform package announced by House leaders on
Wednesday. The provision generally would apply to all branches of
government except the Senate, which is expected to consider a
separate version for itself before Congress adjourns for
Thanksgiving.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>PAY</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The plan envisions top government pay scales increasing at least
35 percent in the next 13{ months.
   House members, federal judges and top executive branch officials
would receive an initial 7.9 percent pay raise by Jan. 1, a ``catch
up'' for two years without a cost-of-living adjustment or COLA.
   On Jan. 1, 1991, the same officials would receive a 25 percent
increase in pay, on top of whatever government-wide COLA takes
effect at that time. At a minimum, assuming no COLA in 1991, the
salary of rank-and-file House members would go to $120,700.
Assuming a COLA of about 3 percent, salaries would be about
$124,400 _ 39 percent above current levels.
   After that, annual pay adjustments of up to 5 percent would be
made automatically based on the government's index of
private-sector wages and salaries.
   The package would abolish the current federal pay commission
which recommends top government salaries and replace it with a new
11-member Citizens Commission.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>OUTSIDE INCOME</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   House members, officers and employees, and other top executive
and judicial officials would be barred from accepting honoraria, or
speaking fees, beginning in 1991. For House members, current rules
limit such fees to 30 percent of salary; for 1990, total
permissible outside income for House members would be frozen at the
1989 level.
   Once the ban takes effect, payments for speeches which may be
given to charity would have to be made directly to the charity and
could not exceed $2,000, and could not go to any charity from which
the official or a relative receives a financial benefit. However,
the House would not make public the name of the charity, as it does
now; only the name of the donor.
   Income earned outside the House by members and top staff would
be limited to 15 percent of congressional salary beginning in 1991.
Officials could not receive directors fees, legal fees or other
income for professional services. Book royalties would be exempt
from the limits, but only if they are from established publishers
and are ``usual and customary.''
   Both the limit on outside income and the honoraria ban would be
lifted if the pay raise is repealed.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>GIFTS AND TRAVEL</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Members and staff could not receive gifts from any person,
outside of family, totaling more than $200 a year beginning Jan. 1,
1990. Most meals and gifts under $75 would not be counted in the
total. Currently, members are barred from receiving more than $100
a year in gifts from anyone with a ``direct interest in
legislation.'' Privately paid speaking trips would be limited to
four days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>ETHICS COMMITTEE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bipartisan House panel would be expanded from 12 to 14
members and would separate its investigative and trial functions.
If a House member is being investigated, the panel would divide
into two groups. One would serve in effect as a grand jury and the
other as the trial jury.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>EXCESS CAMPAIGN FUNDS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   House members who were in office in 1980 and now are allowed to
keep leftover campaign contributions when they retire would see
that privilege abolished in 1993.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More detail would be required in the reporting of privately
funded travel for lawmakers, and new categories of value would be
created on the upper end of the scale for reporting of assets,
liabilities and transactions. Currently, members can report their
most valuable assets in the category of ``$250,000 and above.''
Three new categories would be created for amounts up to $1 million.
The value of assets in blind trusts would have to be reported for
the first time, and tighter restrictions would be placed on who can
be trustee.

   President Bush announced his support Wednesday
for a plan to raise salaries for House members and other top
governmental officials by 35 percent or more while tightening
ethics rules.
   With the president's endorsement, Democratic and Republican
House leaders formally unveiled their plan and said they expect it
will pass easily in a vote Thursday. The Senate is expected to vote
on pay before Thanksgiving, maybe with a different level for itself.
   The House package would, depending on inflation, raise its
salaries by at least 35 percent and more likely 39 percent, from
$89,500 to an estimated $124,400, in just over 13 months. It could
be more.
   Bush, in a letter to the speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley,
said:
   ``Issues such as the ban on congressional honoraria, limits on
gifts and travel, increased financial disclosure, restrictions on
outside income, conflict of interest rules and many other important
reforms have been addressed.
   ``In my view, the bill would effect a tremendous change in the
landscape of government ethics standards.''
   Under the House plan, raises would be given to top officials
government-wide, except for the Senate, which was considering a
separate ethics and pay package for itself.
   The House package implements the pay raise in two stages. On
Jan. 1, members and the very highest paid officials, such as
federal judges and top Executive Branch officials, would get a 7.9
percent increase as a ``cost-of-living'' adjustment to make up for
the two years in which they did not receive raises.
   In 1991, another cost-of-living raise would take effect for
members, and the top-most officials. Under that adjustment, which
would be based on changes in the government's consumer price
calculations, members and high officials would get the same
adjustment normally passed on to all federal workers.
   The $124,400 ultimate pay figure is based on an adjustment of
about 3 percent.
   Also on Jan. 1, 1991, an additional 25 percent raise would be
put in place to accompany implementation of the heart of the ethics
package _ a ban on lawmakers padding their income with speech
honoraria and stricter limits on other outside income.
   The inclusion of a cost-of-living increase in 1991 in addition
to the 25 percent raise was disclosed by lawmakers for the first
time on Wednesday.
   Currently, House members are allowed to keep honoraria up to 30
percent of their income, senators up to 40 percent. The new rules
would ban House members from accepting honoraria and limit other
outside earned income to 15 percent of salary.
   A House member would still be able to give a speech and have the
host donate the money that would be paid to the member to a
legitimate charity. The destination of the payment would be kept
secret by the House ethics committee.
   If Congress later votes to kill the 25 percent pay raise, the
ethics rules changes on outside income would automatically be
rescinded. Cost-of-living raises would continue automatically after
1991, but based on a government index of salary raises in the
private sector.
   Other ethics changes in the bill include:
   _Ending in 1993 the rule whereby House members elected before
1980 can pocket their campaign treasuries when they retire from
Congress. Some members currently have more than $1 million stashed
away.
   _Increased detail of disclosure of personal wealth.
   Currently, the top category is ``$250,000 and above.'' The new
forms would have categories for ``$250,000 to $500,000'' and
``greater than $1 million.'' Members who have blind trusts for
their assets would have to report the size of the trust, in
addition to the current requirement of reporting the income.
   _Revised procedures for the House Ethics Committee, including
expanding the panel so that some members could investigate and
others judge the results. Currently, the whole panel does both.
   The committee would also set up a separate office to educate and
advise lawmakers on ethics rules.
   _Tighten rules for accepting free travel and gifts from people
other than immediate family.
   Several of the ethics changes were in response to the case of
former Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Wright resigned last June
rather than face charges that he accepted improper gifts and evaded
limits on honoraria.
   A 51 percent congressional pay raise, with no attached ethics
package, was rejected earlier this year when Wright was still
speaker.
   White House endorsement of the ethics package was delayed this
week because C. Boyden Gray, the president's counsel, was not
satisfied with conflict-of-interest rules as they applied to
congressional staff.
   The differences were resolved early Wednesday in a meeting
between House Republican leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., and White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu.
   In the Senate, Majority Leader George Mitchell has said he
envisions a more modest pay package for senators, perhaps providing
only the cost-of-living adjustments and a more gradual elimination
of speech honoraria.
   On Wednesday, Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Warren Rudman,
R-N.H., introduced a bill based on the work of their ethics task
force that includes restrictions not found in the House package.
   The Senate plan would tighten ``revolving door'' rules so that,
for the first time, former members of Congress and top staffers
would be not be able to return to Capitol Hill to lobby for one
year. Similar restrictions already exist for the executive branch.
   Like the House package, Senate rules for accepting travel and
gifts would be tightened, and personal financial disclosure would
be increased.

   President Bush went shopping Wednesday night,
stopping traffic on a busy downtown street while he bought two
suits at a men's store.
   The half-hour shopping expedition at the tail end of the evening
rush hour blocked traffic on L Street, one of the capital's main
thoroughfares, as Bush browsed in private at the Arthur A. Adler
shop.
   He emerged after the fitting with a wave for a crowd of 200
people who had gathered at a nearby street corner. He told
reporters later that he had purchased two suits but offered no
description.
   Bush has shopped before at Adler's, but not as president and not
at this particular store, a new location that opened in April.
   John Adler, the owner and president, said, ``We're primarily a
gentlemen's clothing store,'' with suits in ``very classic,
traditional'' style selling from $400 to $1,000.
   Bush shopped at Adler's old location on Connecticut Avenue as
vice president and also bought a tuxedo there that he wore to his
inaugural balls last Jan. 20.
   The president apparently wanted to visit the store in person.
Asked why he had not simply taken some suits to the White House for
Bush to try on, Adler said he has done that before.

<HEAD>Ten-Fold Increase In Potential Losses To Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 10-fold expansion of federal loan programs
over the past 13 years now means the government has lent,
guaranteed or insured $5 trillion _ $20,000 for every man, woman
and child in the country, congressional auditors said Wednesday.
   The General Accounting Office said ultimate losses to the
government would not reach that level.
   ``While the government will undoubtedly not be required to
provide financial assistance for its total exposure associated with
these programs, its continuing and growing exposure to losses
cannot be ignored,'' the GAO said.
   While huge losses already have manifested themselves in the farm
credit bailout in 1987 and the savings and loan rescue this year,
the government is experiencing billions of dollars in losses from
other credit and insurance programs as well, the General Accounting
Office said.
   Altogether, the wide variety of loan guarantee programs has
increased by 51 percent over the past five years to $550 billion.
But annual defaults on those guarantees have jumped 138 percent,
from $4.7 billion in 1983 to $11.2 billion last year, the GAO said.
   The real situation could be worse, GAO cautioned. For example,
just two months ago GAO auditors found $4.2 billion in Federal
Housing Administration FHA loan defaults in 1988 _ five times what
the agency reported.
   ``The full magnitude of the government's losses under its credit
assistance and insurance programs is not known,'' the GAO said.
``Because of long-standing deficiencies in financial managements
and inconsistencies in the application of accounting principles by
federal agencies, losses are not always being recorded or reported
when they occur.''
   From 1985 to 1988 losses on direct loans written off by the
government increased 1,700 percent _ from $1.2 billion to $21.2
billion _ and delinquent loans rose by 33 percent, from $14.6
billion to $19.5 billion last year.
   But the loan guarantees adopted by the Reagan administration as
part of an effort to reduce direct government lending and the
federal deficit pose even greater risks, the GAO said.
   ``Many newer guarantee programs such as those for education and
energy conservation involve loans with little or no marketable
property as security,'' the auditors said.
   Others, such as those for small businesses which cannot obtain
credit in the private market otherwise, can quickly turn sour upon
industry downturns and other changes in the economy, the auditors
said.
   As one example, the GAO cited the Department of Education's
student loan guarantee program, which has grown in size from $26.5
billion in 1983 to $47.6 billion last year. During that same time,
reported defaults on student loans have almost tripled, From $486
million in 1983 to more than $1.4 billion in 1988.
   In addition to the outstanding $222 billion in direct federal
loans and $550 billion in loan guarantees, the government also is
liable for $3.6 trillion in insurance commitments, most of it
covering deposits in banks, S&amp;Ls and credit unions. Outstanding
loans by government-sponsored enterprises, such as the Federal
National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp., Freddie Mac, total $656 billion, up from $15
billion in 1965.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who requested the study as chairman
of the House Energy and Commerce Commission, said it indicates that
the government is ``guilty of the same shell game'' that critics of
banks contend is being used to inflate beyond their true value
their loans to Third World countries.
   Dingell did not question the value of the programs, saying many
of served worthy purposes such as enabling people to attend
college, buy homes and start businesses.
   ``What's at issue,'' he said, ``is the public's exposure in the
event of losses or defaults.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle of San Salvador
tilted in the government's favor Wednesday as troops drove
guerrillas from working-class neighborhoods in fierce combat while
civilians fled or cowered in their homes.
   But the insurgents, in the fifth day of their most ambitious
offensive in nearly nine years, demonstrated remarkable staying
power in other neighborhoods, repelling repeated army assaults or
regrouping after setbacks to strike again.
   Even so, the armed forces' air power and numerical superiority
combined with a lack of insurrectional spirit in most working-class
neighborhoods to stall the massive guerrilla push.
   ``What we have at the moment is complete control over the entire
national territory, and the terrorist delinquents have failed in
their adventure,'' said Vice President Francisco Merino.
   His claim, made at a news conference, appeared somewhat
exaggerated as the insurgents were thoroughly entrenched in several
zones in and around the capital and in the countryside.
   Also Wednesday the government, which on Sunday decreed a state
of siege suspending most constitutional guarantees, tightened
limits on freedom of expression with a directive sent to all local
media.
   The directive prohibits Salvadoran media from publishing any
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) communique or
those of any group intending to disseminate FMLN activities.
   It also prohibits ``publication of information from foreign
agencies or countries that maintain a clear opposition to the
Salvadoran government and people.''
   The directive too obliges local editors ``to consult with the
official source'' on any war-related news.
   Casualty figures from the fighting were inexact, but surveys of
hospitals and a tally based on several sources indicated more than
500 people _ including civilians, guerrillas and soldiers _ have
been killed and more than 1,000 wounded.
   Several hundred rebels, including two top commanders, were dug
in at the northern capital district of Mejicanos. The scene in
Mejicanos differed from that of Soyapango and Zacamil _ other
guerrilla strongholds in recent days _ in that most Mejicanos
residents have stayed on in their homes, and many appear to be
decidedly aligned with the rebels.
   Most of the civilians in Soyapango and Zacamil had fled the
combat zones by Wednesday afternoon.
   ``Helping `los muchachos' (the boys) makes us happy,'' said an
elderly man outside the local clinic. ``It would be better to die
struggling than let the SOB soldiers kill us with impunity.''
   His words were punctuated by a U.S.-supplied C-47 warplane
flying directly above and firing hollow-sounding bursts from its
.50-caliber machine guns at rebel positions.
   The neighborhood's combative spirit was evident. Residents
carried pots of soup from their homes to rebels seated on the
clinic patio. Young men asked for and received instruction in the
use of the rebels' assault rifles. Barricades blocked roads and
tracks.
   Facundo Guardado, a top FMLN commander, said the offensive had
one of two objectives: ``To oblige the government to negotiate
seriously and responsibly,'' or, failing that, to topple the
rightist administration of President Alfredo Cristiani.
   In Geneva, the International Red Cross called on both sides to
arrange a cease-fire for the urgent evacuation of wounded.
   Merino characterized the idea of a truce as impractical, and
speculated that the rebels might take tactical advantage of such a
measure.
   Residents of some of the working-class neighborhoods north and
east of this capital where fighting has been the heaviest began
burning partially decomposed bodies in the streets.
   Rebels opened a new front, in Merliot on the capital's western
outskirts. They blocked the highway into the capital and
established positions over several blocks.
   But government forces counterattacked strongly with rocket- and
machine gun-equipped helicopters, heavy caliber strafing from C-47
warplanes and hundreds of troops.
   The rebels were pushed out after two hours of combat. But they
regrouped on the lower slopes of the looming San Salvador volcano
and shortly before dusk struck back at government positions in
Merliot. Heavy fighting continued there at nightfall.
   Heavy combat also broke out shortly before dusk in Zacamil, on
the capital's northern outskirts. Comunidad Emanuel, a small
shantytown, was set ablaze and a pillar of smoke from it rose over
the northern zone.
   Ten rebels, looking tired and anxious, were confined to a rear
alley of the Conacaste section of Soyapango. Their commander, a
tall lean man missing part of his left hand, said they had run out
of food.
   Juan Alberto Ponce, a 30-year-old construction worker, said
Wednesday he had been trying to reach Alley 4, where his family was
holed up, for three days without success.
   Heavy fire from assault rifles, .30-caliber machine guns and
rocket-propelled grenades echoed deafeningly through the narrow
alleys of one-floor cinderblock homes. Gunsmoke was so thick it
reduced visibility to 15 feet.
   Residents evacuated two wounded civilians _ one a middle-aged
woman with her jaw blown off _ on improvised stretchers.
   In Zacamil, only a few civilian familiesremained in the
apartment blocks.
   Adriana Garcia huddled in apartment 43 of Block 111A with her
family and Maria Zubarria, 45, who has cancer and is two days past
due for her cobalt treatment. Mrs. Zubarria's face, forearms and
ankles were swollen because of the delay.
   ``Please help get us out!'' Mrs. Garcia implored. She said she
felt herself a virtual hostage of the guerrillas.
   ``We serve as their protection,'' she said, echoing the
government's contention that the rebels were shielding themselves
behind civilians.
   Rebel commander Ana Guadalupe Martinez, speaking on the
insurgents' clandestine Radio Venceremos, said the guerrillas had
declared more than a quarter of the Massachusetts-sized country
``liberated.''
   She said local revolutionary committees had been set up in
dozens of towns.
   In the provinces, conflicting claims by government and
guerrillas were impossible to confirm, but radio correspondents _
prohibited from broadcasting news by the state of siege _ said
fighting continued in and around the provincial capitals of San
Miguel, Santa Ana and Zacatecoluca.
   A 10-year-old civil war between the FMLN and a succession of
U.S.-backed governments has killed about 70,000 people, most of
them civilians.

   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard C. Breeden said Wednesday that he supports pending new
market regulation legislation even though it doesn't ban program
trading.
   Breeden told a group of reporters at SEC headquarters that the
controversial, computer-driven trading strategy is only a symptom
of bigger market problems.
   ``I think we need a close look at the whole issue of volatility
and the factors that help produce it and the elements that may be
at work. I'd like to make sure that before we treat only the
symptom that we also are aware of what the disease is,'' he said.
   Critics of program trading, in which enormous blocks of stocks
are bought or sold in a wink of an eye through computer-driven
entry of buy and sell orders, say it can lead to excessive
volatility _ sharp price rises and drops _ which in turn, scares
small investors out of the market.
   And that, say the critics, makes it hard for U.S. companies to
sell securities and raise capital.
   Breeden said he supported recently amended legislation pending
before the House Energy and Commerce Committee that would allow the
SEC to curtail trading practices found to be ``manipulative or
abusive.''
   ``I don't think it gives us the authority to ban program trading
per se,'' Breeden said of the Securities Markets Stabilization Act
of 1989. ``The thrust of this section is not to ban program trading
as one practice in the marketplace. But what it does allow us to do
is to specify specific harmful practices, including those
associated with program trading.''
   If the bill was passed, said Breeden, the SEC could then
``define rules that would bar specific practices that we deem to be
harmful and contributing to excessive volatility and those
practices could include program trading.''
   Originally the bill would have allowed the SEC to intervene when
it considered trading practices to be ``disruptive,'' but members
of the telecommunications and finance subcomitee argued that the
word was too vague.
   In a letter to the subcommittee, Robert R. Glauber, an
undersecretary of the Treasury argued the word ``is itself
disruptive.''
   Glauber wrote that it could ``derail the chances for final
passage of other important provisions included in this
legislation.''
   The bill must be passed by the Energy and Commerce Committee
before going to the House floor. Congressional leaders have said
they want to adjourn for the holidays next week.
   A similar bill is slated to be considered by the Seanate Banking
Committee Thursday.

   A man with a shotgun killed three people in
a car at an intersection Wednesday afternoon, including a former
girlfriend who had filed assault charges against him, officials
said.
   The suspect apparently followed the victims' car from work to
the intersection, Police Chief Ed Crider said.
   Crider said the one man and two women, all in the same car, were
killed. He said the names of the victims, including a man and woman
who were blind, were being withheld pending notification of
relatives.
   Tupelo Detective Wayne Tutor said 30-year-old Joe L. Westbrooks
had been charged earlier with burglary and simple assault in
connection with alleged attacks on the driver of the car.
   The driver, a mother of three children, ``carried these two
people home from work every night and would go get them in the
morning,'' said Rob Russell, owner of BHR Co., a Tupelo publishing
firm where the three victims worked.
   Russell said the driver was Westbrooks' former girlfriend, and
the Tupelo man had harassed the eight-week employee of his firm
since the couple's breakup a month ago.
   The police chief said two of the victims died at the scene of
the 4:10 p.m. shootings, and the third person died later at a
Tupelo hospital.
   Westbrooks was taken into custody moments after the shooting, he
said. Witnesses said the suspect shot the three out of the window
of his own car. The victims apparently had just left BHR, Crider
said.
   Crider said Patrolman Larry Grissom stopped Westbrooks soon
after the shooting and confiscated a 12-gauge shotgun.

<HEAD>Convictions of Thrift Owner Thrown Out; Ohio to Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ohio plans to challenge a state appeals court
decision Wednesday that threw out criminal convictions of
principals of Home State Savings Bank, whose collapse triggered a
statewide thrift crisis in 1985.
   Lawyers for the state said they will carry their fight to the
Ohio Supreme Court against the ruling that reversed convictions of
former Home State owner Marvin Warnerr, a millionaire and former U.S. ambassador
to Switzerland,
and Schiebel were convicted by a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court
jury on charges resulting from the Cincinnati-based thrift's
collapse in March 1985.
   Both Warner and Schiebel have been free on bond while appealing
their March 1987 convictions. Warner, 70, had been sentenced to 3{
years in prison. Schiebel, 58, was sentenced to six months.
   Warner said Wednesday from his Ocala, Fla., horse farm that his
reputation is still at stake.
   ``I feel sort of like Ray Donovan. Donovan was found not guilty
and he asked, `Which office do I go to to get my reputation back?'
That's about the situation I'm in,'' he said, referring to former
Reagan administration labor secretary who was cleared by a New York
jury in May 1987 of fraud and larceny charges.
   Schiebel said, ``I always knew I'd be vindicated.''
   A three-judge panel of the 1st Ohio District Court of Appeals
reversed the convictions on three securities counts charging the
two men covered up Home State's precarious finances in circulars
distributed to raise money for Home State in 1984. That portion of
the case was sent back to the lower court for a possible new trial.
   Home State's collapse caused a crisis for 69 other privately
insured Ohio savings and loans institutions whose deposits were
insured by the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund.
   The appeals court upheld defense arguments challenging the
seating of trial juror Beth Statt, who had an account at another
bank insured by the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund.
   The appeals court also dimissed Warner's conviction on six
counts that he oversaw unauthorized transfers of Home State money
to a trading partner, ESM Government Securities Inc. of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. The court said the state did not present
sufficient evidence.
   R. Stan Mortenson, a lawyer for Warner, said Warner cannot be
retried on those counts.
   Home State collapsed four days after ESM was declared insolvent.
The thrift lost $144 million through its securities transactions
with ESM.
   The appellate court also threw out the lower court's order that
Warner pay $22 million in restitution to Ohio and $250,000 in
prosecution costs, and that Schiebel pay $25,000 in prosecution
costs.
   The court said the cost and restitution penalties were based on
a statement of fees submitted by the state that had not been
certified as correct and legal.
   Lawrence A. Kane Jr., Ohio's special prosecutor who obtained the
convictions, said the state will appeal.
   ``The court's decision is based on technical, procedural issues,
not the merits of the guilt or innocence of the defendants,'' Kane
said.
   Before it collapsed, Home State had about $1.4 billion in assets
and served about 92,000 depositors in the Cincinnati, Columbus and
Dayton areas.
   The savings bank was sold and reopened in June 1985. Gov.
Richard Celeste temporarily closed the other thrifts and ordered
them to obtain federal deposit insurance or merge with companies
that had it before reopening.

   Thunderstorms wreaked havoc across the middle Mississippi Valley
and the Southeast on Wednesday with lethal tornadoes, wind up to
100 mph and hail up to the size of baseballs.
   At least four tornadoes pounded the Huntsville, Ala., area. One
twister smashed into a residential district, a shopping area and a
school, killing at least two people and causing dozens of injuries,
police said.
   Southern Illinois was also hard hit by the storms, with one
woman killed by a falling tree, about 20 people injured and power
lines downed.
   Elsewhere, snow fell from the northern Rockies to the upper
Great Lakes, while unseasonably mild weather continued in the East.
   People in Alorton, Ill., a village of 2,700 about five miles
southeast of East St. Louis, were injured when trees fell on their
houses or mobile homes, said Bill Gamblin of the St. Clair County
Emergency Services and Disaster Agency.
   At Parks College in Cahokia, Ill., eight miles south of East St.
Louis, aircraft hangers were twisted and flattened and small
aircraft tossed around the airport by high winds, the National
Weather Service said.
   Storms in the area generated wind estimated at 80 to 100 mph,
the weather service said.
   The thunderstorms developed along and ahead of a strong cold
front and swept eastward from Missouri and Arkansas.
   Thunderstorms crossing northeastern Arkansas whipped up high
wind which blew away metal roofing being installed on a high school
gymnasium at Lepanto and dumped hail up to 2 inches in diameter at
Leachville.
   Heavy thunderstorms, possibly a tornado, struck the north
Georgia town of Palmetto late Wednesday, causing extensive damage,
authorities said.
   In central and southwest Ohio, thunderstorms packing winds up to
66 mph destroyed barns and a trailer home and tore the roofs off
several buildings. Some injuries but no fatalities were reported.
   An afternoon thunderstorm in east-central Alabama formed a
tornado which damaged at least one home, and the Clay County
Sheriff's office said an unknown number of people were injured in
one house.
   Thunderstorms sweeping across Tennessee spun off a tornado in
southeastern Madison Country, and dropped hail as big as baseballs
north of Jackson, the weather service said.
   Hail stones as big as tennis balls fell near Huntingburg, Ind.,
the weather service said.
   The heaviest rainfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST was
1.22 inches at Peru, Ind.
   Wind up to 65 mph damaged roofs, power lines and trees in parts
of Kentucky and Louisiana, the weather service said.
   Severe thunderstorms also developed over Alabama and South
Carolina during the afternoon, and the weather service reported a
tornado north of Greenwood, S.C.
   Other showers and thunderstorms, with locally heavy rain, were
widely scattered along the northern Atlantic Coast.
   Light snow associated with an arctic cold front extended from
eastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado into western Minnesota.
Snow also fell across parts of northern Wisconsin and Upper
Michigan.
   As much as 1 to 2 feet of snow was possible by Thursday morning
along the Lake Superior shore of Wisconsin.
   Strong northwesterly wind ushering the cold air into the
north-central states gusted above 40 mph during the afternoon,
creating wind chill readings colder than 25 degrees below zero.
   Snow, high wind and rapidly falling temperatures associated with
the cold front briefly produced near-blizzard conditions in
Nebraska late Wednesday morning.
   Unseasonably warm weather continued in the East with afternoon
readings in the 60s in New England, and in the 80s over Florida,
southern Texas and southern Louisiana.
   Wednesday morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 9 degrees
above zero at Ely, Nev.

   The vice principal of a junior high
school was shot once in the back in a school parking lot Wednesday
and a 13-year-old boy was taken into custody, police said.
   Andy Chambers, 44, was in surgery at Arlington Memorial Hospital
to remove a bullet lodged in his abdomen, said hospital spokeswoman
Carlene Ness.
   ``He is alert and it doesn't appear to be life-threatening,''
Ms. Ness said. ``They're going in to do exploratory surgery now and
probably remove the bullet.''
   Chambers was shot once in the back at a Workman Junior High
School parking lot at about 3:45 p.m. as students and teachers were
leaving for the day, said Dee Anderson, spokesman for the Arlington
Police Department.
   Several teachers and students witnessed the shooting, he said.
   The 13-year-old boy, who was not identified because of his age,
was taken to the Tarrant County Juvenile Detention Center for
arraignment.
   A .22 caliber pistol was found in a ditch near the school
parking lot, where the shooting took place, Anderson said.
   Chambers did not see who shot him, but said he had not been
involved in any recent confrontations with students, Anderson said.

   A communist deputy in Parliament has
turned in his party card and resigned from the communist caucus in
the legislature, state television reported Wednesday.
   A report on the evening news said the deputy, Zdzislaw
Czernobilski, had informed caucus leader Marian Orzechowski of his
resignation in a letter.
   Czernobilski did not give any explanation in the letter why he
was quitting the party, but thanked his colleagues for their past
cooperation, the report said.
   It is the latest setback for the beleaguered communist party,
which became the first in the East bloc to lose control of the
government on Aug. 24 when former Solidarity editor Tadeusz
Mazowiecki was named prime minister.
   The communists were battered in partially free elections in June
and recently lost control of the mayoral office in the provincial
city of Lodz.
   Thousands of party members turned in their cards after the
Solidarity trade union was legalized after a seven-year ban this
April.
   Following the devastating loss of power and prestige, the party
has decided that it should completely retool itself, starting with
a name change.
   But hard-liners are resisting reform, and the changes are not
expected before a party congress scheduled for January.
   According to parliamentary rules, Czernobilski could join
another caucus or remain as an independent.

   The crew of a Greek container ship that
ran aground on St. Matthew Island was rescued Wednesday, and the
accident left a 12-mile long slick of fuel oil in the Bering Sea,
the Coast Guard reported.
   The ship's tanks held 294,000 gallons of a diesel fuel-oil
mixture, but officials were unsure how much of that had leaked,
Coast Guard spokesman Greg Robinson said from Juneau.
   Coast Guard investigators planned to fly over the slick at dawn
Thursday to assess what cleanup measures, if any, are needed.
   The 27 crew members were transferred from the grounded Milos
Reefer to a nearby Polish ship, Robinson said.
   The 485-foot refrigerated fish-carrier ran aground Tuesday night
and was taking on water. No injuries were reported and the ship had

<HEAD>Migrant Workers Fall Ill From Pesticide Exposure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RUSKIN, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 migrant farmworkers were
treated for vomiting, dizziness and heart and breathing problems
Wednesday after they were exposed to a toxic pesticide in a
cauliflower field, officials said.
   Morning workers at Goodson Farms began falling ill as soon as
they entered a 16-acre field which had been sprayed the previous
afternoon with the pesticide phosdrin, farm employees said.
   ``This is a pesticide we use all the time. As soon as it's dry,
it's safe to go in there,'' said farm manager Henry Almond. ``But
this morning, one got sick and pretty soon they all started getting
sick.''
   Phosdrin is a common, though highly toxic, pesticide sprayed on
a wide variety of agricultural crops to control worms. The label
warns that fields sprayed with it should not be entered without
protective clothing for at least 48 hours, said Tasha Brew, a
pesticide education specialist at the University of Florida's
cooperative extension service.
   ``Sometimes we go in about an hour after spraying, so long as
it's dry,'' Almond said. ``This didn't stop us. We got people back
out there now.''
   The workers wore protective boots and gloves to protect them
from any pesticide residue, he said.
   Crew managers at the farm began taking the first workers to a
rural clinic, and later ambulances were dispatched to bring in more.
   ``The pesticide enters through the skin, so we first had to
strip their clothes off, shower them and wrap them in sheets,''
said Judy Brown, administrator at the Ruskin Migrant Health Center.
``They were covered with it.''
   Most of the workers suffered from vomiting, dizziness and
blurred vision, with a handful showing breathing and heartbeat
problems, said Ms. Brown, adding that a total of 77 had come
through the clinic by late afternoon.
   Four patients were admitted to South Bay Hospital in nearby Sun
City with depressed heartbeats and breathing problems, said
hospital spokeswoman Oona Lewis.
   About 25 others were treated and released at Tampa General
Hospital, with the rest treated at the clinic, officials said.
   Almond said the workers were in the fields tying leaves around
the cauliflower to keep the fleshy part of the plants from
yellowing. The plants were scheduled to be harvested in about eight
days.

<TEXT>
   A previously unknown group said Wednesday
it had kidnapped an American woman and two naturalized West Germans
_ a man born in Lebanon and his 7-year-old son.
   The claim was made in a typewritten statement, in Arabic, for a
group calling itself The Organization of Just Revenge. The
statement was delivered to a Western news agency with photocopies
of the passports and visas of the three people.
   It identified the American as Deborah Fahrend, 54, of San
Francisco, and described her as a publisher-journalist. The two
others were identified as Mounir Shamseddin Sami, 39, born in
Lebanon, and his son, Danjel, born in Berlin.
   ``The Organization of Just Revenge announces its responsibility
for kidnapping the West German Mounir Sami (born in Lebanon) and
his son Danjel Sami and American publisher-journalist Deborah
Fahrend in Beirut for their activities in Lebanon,'' it said.
   No demands were made in the poorly typed statement, which gave
no details and did not say when the abduction occurred. The
kidnapping could not be confirmed.
   Ms. Fahrend would be the first American woman abducted in
Lebanon, and one of only a few women of any nationality.
   Ms. Fahrend's mother, Margaret Brooks of Davis, Calif., said
that in a letter she received last week her daughter said she was
going to Beirut with someone named Mounir and wrote: ``I'm going to
use Mounir's connections to the hilt,'' referring to diplomatic
friends he had in Lebanon. ``It seems to me to me a chance in a
lifetime.''
   Ms. Brooks said her daughter referred to Mounir as her
``therapist and really good friend.''
   Ms. Fahrend's sister, Emily Rowe, 59, also of Davis, said in an
interview that her sister chose the name Fahrend, which means
traveling or itinerant in German, as a pen name while living in
India several years ago.
   ``She tackles life pretty much head-on,'' Ms. Rowe said. ``She
would be unaware of danger in thinking of going to Lebanon, instead
thinking of the opportunities for professional advancement.''
   She described the family's reaction as ``a state of shock.''
   Jane McCullough, a friend of Ms. Fahrend in San Geronimo, a town
20 miles north of San Francisco where she is said to have lived
until 1987, said they last met when her friend visited in June.
   She said the description ``publisher-journalist'' surprised her.
She said Ms. Fahrend, who she indicated was divorced and had two
daughters, was a registered nurse and sometime poet.
   ``She traveled extensively and was a poet _ wrote poetry about
the places she visited,'' Ms. McCullough said.
   A State Department official in Washington, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said the department had no information on Ms. Fahrend
and ``we're trying to find out if she had a waiver on her
passport.''
   Americans are prohibited from traveling to Lebanon without such
a waiver of the rules.
   The documents showed one-entry visas issued for Ms. Fahrend and
the two Germans by Consul Michelene Baz at the Lebanese Embassy in
Nicosia, Cyprus, on Nov. 1.
   Attempts to reach Ms. Baz on Wednesday night were unsuccessful.
Other Lebanese diplomatic sources in Nicosia said further details
about the visa applications would be available Thursday morning.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Cyprus said he had no information on
the kidnappings. The American Embassy in Beirut has been closed
since Sept. 22.
   The documents also showed entry stamps by the Lebanese security
department at the Christian port of Jounieh north of Beirut, dated
Nov. 3, an indication the three traveled from Cyprus to Lebanon
together by sea.
   No information was available on whether they remained in the
Christian sector or crossed to Moslem west Beirut before their
abduction.
   The West German Embassy in Beirut said it had no knowledge of
the abduction until the statement was released after nightfall.
   If the kidnapping is confirmed, Ms. Fahrend would be the only
Western woman now held captive in Lebanon, where women have been
kidnapped only rarely.
   One was Danielle Perez, daughter of French hostage Marcel
Carton, who was kidnapped with her father in 1985 by Islamic Jihad,
a Shiite Moslem group loyal to Iran, and released 12 hours later.
Carton was held more than three years later.
   Ms. Fahrend's father was identified in the visa photocopy as
Frederick Brooks and her mother as Margaret Brooks. Her passport
was issued in San Francisco Oct. 15, 1984.
   Eighteen other foreigners are held in Lebanon, including eight
Americans. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Most of the hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian factions.

<HEAD>American Tourist Hacked to Death in St. Lucia</HEAD>

   An American tourist was hacked to
death when a man with a history of mental illness attacked her as
she was hiking up a mountain on this Caribbean island, authorities
said Wednesday.
   The Tourist Board said Leroy McDoom, who according to police was
mentally ill, on Tuesday fatally cut Judith Taylor with a machete
in the southwestern town of Soufriere, 26 miles from Castries.
   Ms. Taylor, in her 30s, unmarried and believed to be a dual
citizen of the United States and West Germany, suffered a severed
arm and died shortly after the attack. Her hometown was not
immediately known, the Tourist Board said.
   She was with a group of six tourists attempting to scale the
2,461-foot Petit Piton mountain, a main tourist attraction here.
   ``It is understood that the group divided, Ms. Taylor and a male
companion resting whilst the main group continued,'' the Tourist
Board said in a statement. ``McDoom apparently harassed Ms. Taylor
and her companion who went to seek assitance from the other members
of the group. During his brief absence, Ms. Taylor was attacked and
fatally wounded.''
   McDoom was taken into custody, police said. Charges are pending.
   The incident came exactly one year after a British tourist,
Leonard Wiseman, was shot to death during a holdup at a picnic.
Last month, Hazel Emmanuel, 35, was sentenced to hang for the
murder.
   In 1988, more than 214,000 tourists visited this island of
140,000 people, where tourism is the main foreign exchange-earner.

   An Air Force security policeman
pleaded guilty Wednesday to stealing more than $3,900 in military
supplies from a base where two other security men pilfered F-16 jet
engines.
   Hill Air Force Base Staff Sgt. Timothy M. Eastabrook was to
begin his court-martial Wednesday, but instead entered the plea as
part of an apparent plea-bargain.
   Eastabrook was to have been the first man to face general
court-martial as a result of ``Operation Punchout,'' a 2{-year
undercover investigation of military thefts from bases in the West
and Southwest.
   Fourteen Hill personnel have been charged to date, with seven
facing military courts-martial and seven indicted by a federal
grand jury.
   Two other Hill security policemen have pleaded guilty to
stealing three F-16 jet engines and selling them to undercover
agents. They await sentencing in U.S. District Court.
   The two charges against Eastabrook, 28, alleged that between
October 1986 and April he stole almost 100 items and illegally sold
them to Military Surplus Brokers, an FBI front in Roy.
   In the plea-bargain, Eastabrook pleaded guilty to both charges,
but to stealing slightly more than $3,900 rather than the $5,304 he
originally had been charged with. The remaining goods were
apparently items he had been issued, officials said.
   Lawyers on both sides said military justice rules prevented them
from discussing the plea-bargain.
   Three other Hill enlisted men have gone through special
courts-martial on charges they illegally sold military supplies.
Two were acquitted and one was found guilty, demoted and sentenced
to a month in jail.
   On Tuesday, another Hill security policeman pleaded guilty to
three counts of theft of government property. Airman 1st Class
Patrick John Oltmanns, 21, from Moose Lake, Minn., is scheduled to
stand trial Jan. 8.
   Oltmanns is charged with stealing aircraft aviation instruments,
military gear and miscellaneous clothing items between July 1988
and February 1989.

   A truck crashed into a parked car on the
shoulder of the New York State Thruway and sheared off its roof
Wednesday, killing two children and seriously injuring five adults,
police said.
   The truck, owned by Grand Union supermarkets, was southbound on
the Thruway when it rear-ended the passenger car on the right
shoulder just after 1 p.m., said Thruway state police Sgt. R.D.
Tompkins.
   He said the vehicles were pitched into a rock wall along the
shoulder and the truck continued down the highway for 180 feet.
   Five adults, including the driver of the tractor trailer truck,
suffered serious to critical injuries and were taken to Benedictine
Hospital in Kingston, Tompkins said.
   Four adults were in the car with the two children who were
killed, he said.
   The names of the dead and injured were not immediately released

   A scene in a Parisian tavern that Pablo Picasso
painted when he was 25 in exchange for free meals and drinks sold
for $40.7 million at auction Wednesday.
   The 1905 painting ``Au Lapin Agile,'' in which Picasso depicts
himself as a harlequin, is ``the most important 20th-century
picture to come up for auction,'' said John L. Marion, chairman of
Sotheby's North America.
   ``It goes to the Annenberg Collection,'' Marion said as he
hammered down the sale. Southeby's had predicted the work would
fetch $35 million to $40 million.
   The auction house said the painting will go to the private
collection of Walter Annenberg of Rancho Mirage, Calif., the
philanthropist and former owner of TV Guide magazine, a close
friend of former President Reagan.
   The painting was consigned by Linda de Roulet, daughter of art
collector Joan Whitney Payson, who acquired it in 1952 and hung it
in her Manhasset home. Mrs. de Roulet said in a statement she felt
``Au Lapin Agile'' has become too valuable a painting to keep.
   ``I plan to establish a foundation for medical research and
education with part of the proceeds,'' she added.
   ``Au Lapin Agile'' was painted four years after another famous
self-portrait, ``Yo Picasso,'' which sold for $47.85 million at
Sotheby's in May. That was a record for the artist and more than
double its presale estimate.
   The record for any work of art _ $53.9 million _ was set in 1987
for Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises,'' also from the Payson collection.
   Several other paintings were on the block Wednesday:
   _Picasso's ``The Mirror,'' one of a series of portraits of
sleeping women done in 1932, was expected to bring up to $25
million.
   _``Mere et Enfant,'' which dates from 1921 _ the year of the
birth of Picasso's son _ is estimated at up to $15 million.
   _A Renoir pastel, ``Young Girls at the Piano,'' produced in 1892
on a commission from the French government, did not sell Wednesday.
It had been expected to bring up to $30 million.
   _Van Gogh's ``Quarry near Saint-Remy,'' a landscape painted in
1889, was estimated to bring up to $15 million.
   _Major pieces by Piet Mondrian, Picasso, Paul Klee, Willem de
Kooning, Claude Monet and Joan Miro were being auctioned from the
collection of the late Edgar Kaufmann Jr. The 21 pieces were
expected to bring between $30 million and $40 million.
   Diane Brooks, Sotheby's president, described ``Au Lapin Agile''
as a large, powerful, serious painting, one of the most important
of Picasso's rose period.
   In addition, she said, ``The subject has a story behind it.''
   Done when he was 25, the painting shows Picasso and a woman _
model Germaine Pichot _ standing at a bar, brooding and obviously
disenchanted with one another.
   Picasso blamed Pichot as being the cause of his best friend's
suicide four years earlier.
   ``The big question in the picture is whether or not at the time
it was painted Picasso was actually having an affair with this
woman himself,'' Brooks said.
   In the background is Frederic Gerard, the owner of the tavern
Lapin Agile (Sprightly Rabbit) and the painting's first owner. A
photograph from the period shows the painting hanging unframed in
the bar.

   The state's largest public employee
union was picketed Wednesday by its own field organizers, who went
on strike after contract negotiations broke down late Tuesday.
   The 10-member United Staff Union of Iowa called the strike
against Council 61 of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees after mediation failed to produce a new
contract.
   ``We feel it's in the best interests of both parties to resolve
it as soon as possible,'' said Dan Varner, an AFSCME field worker
on the picket line.
   United Staff Union is seven AFSCME field workers and three
AFSCME clerical workers. On Wednesday, they carried signs outside
Council 61 headquarters in Des Moines while negotiations continued
inside.
   Lynda Coleman, president of United Staff Union, said the union
and AFSCME officials have agreed on a 2.5 percent wage increase,
but that AFSCME wants the raise to take effect Jan. 1.
   United Staff wants the increase retroactive to Oct. 1, with back
wages paid by Dec. 31.
   AFSCME officials did not return phone calls Wednesday.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 4th graf to UPDATE with Walesa leaving
dinner because of exhaustion.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, saluted on his
historic visit to Congress with cheers, whistles and four standing
ovations, declared Wednesday that American aid to Poland ``will not
be wasted, and will never be forgotten.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press a few hours later,
Walesa said, ``I am an optimist'' that the economic assistance
promised by Congress and President Bush will enable the first
non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc to survive.
   ``I think we will have enough time,'' he said.
   Walesa made his remarks on a day in which Bush hailed him as
``America's special guest.'' He was treated exactly that way, from
his historic appearance before a joint session of Congress in the
morning to a private meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III in the afternoon and a dinner back in the Capitol at the end of
the day.
   Walesa left that dinner early, saying that he was exhausted.
   In his speech before Congress, he asked for more investment to
help pull a bankrupt Polish economy from ``the verge of utter
catastrophe'' and said such assistance in peacetime is ``better
than tanks, warships and warplanes.''
   In an emotional speech recounting the nine-year struggle of his
union to form a democratic government, Walesa gave thanks to
Congress and the American people for years of support and words of
admiration.
   ``These are appreciated, but being a worker and a man of
concrete work, I must tell you that the supply of words on the
world market is plentiful, but the demand is falling. Let deeds
follow words now,'' said the mustachioed 46-year-old former
shipyard electrician.
   In the interview, he said he was ``uncomfortable'' when asked
whether Bush was doing too little to aid Poland, as charged by
congressional Democrats.
   ``I, Lech Walesa, chairman of Soldarity, am happy, glad with
what President Bush is doing now. I am grateful for what he is
doing and for his assistance in our reforms,'' Walesa said. ``I can
say in unequivocal terms, he is a friend of Soldarity.''
   But Walesa said Bush was ``very careful. He is checking what he
can do'' and ``first all his responsibility is to this country and
nobody can have anything against that.''
   Walesa, who wraps up his visit to Washington on Thursday, also
made a joint appearance at the AFL-CIO convention with Bush, who
hailed him as ``America's special guest'' and promised more aid for
Poland.
   ``Clearly there are times when the need for progress demands
that we put differences aside, and where Poland is concerned, now
is such a time,'' Bush said.
   ``Today, I appeal to the unions and on the American labor
movement, the business community, and government to look for ways
to support a partnership for progress in Poland for the sake of a
nation and a people that need and deserve our help,'' he said.
   Walesa, addressing a joint meeting of Congress, drew resounding
applause when he said that ``assistance extended to democracy and
freedom in Poland and all of Eastern Europe is the best investment
in the future of peace, better than tanks, warships and warplanes,
an investment leading to greater security.''
   Walesa arrived in Washington on Monday for a four-day visit
marked by numerous awards and a torrent of praise as Poland and
other East European nations rapidly institute democratic and market
reforms.
   In more concrete action, the Senate voted Tuesday to authorize
$657 million in economic aid to Poland over three years and $81
million for nearby Hungary, also dismantling its centrally
controlled economy.
   The House went further, approving an initial one-year
installment of $533 million for the two Soviet bloc nations.
   ``The decision by the Congress of the United States about
granting economic aid to Poland opens a new road,'' Walesa said.
``For this wonderful decision, I thank you warmly. I promise that
this aid will not be wasted and will never be forgotten.''
   The steps to send economic aid to Poland have been accompanied
by personal adulation for Walesa. He received the Presidential
Medal of Freedom from President Bush on Monday, an AFL-CIO human
rights award on Tuesday, and on Wednesday became the second foreign
private citizen to address a joint meeting of Congress, the first
since the Marquis de Lafayette in 1824.
   The House chamber was packed with senators, representatives,
members of Bush's Cabinet, staff members, journalists, and even the
Soviet ambassador to Washington, Yuri Dubinin, who carefully read
Walesa's prepared text and applauded the delivery.
   Vice President Dan Quayle and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley were
on the dais, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other dignitaries
sat to one side.
   Walesa entered the chamber at 11:04 EST, and received a
five-minute standing ovation punctuated by a few whoops and
whistles as he flashed his trademark ``V'' for victory sign. His
remarks were translated by Jacek Kalabinski, an emigre Solidarity
activist who was once accused of treason by the former communist
government.
   Walesa clearly relished his warm welcome as a representative of
Polish democracy before ``Congress, which for many people in the
world, oppressed and stripped of their rights, is a beacon of
freedom and a bulwark of human rights.''
   He began his remarks with the opening words of the preamble to
the U.S. constitution, ``We the People. ...''
   ``I do not need to explain that I, an electrician from Gdansk,
am also entitled to invoke them,'' said Walesa.
   Walesa said Solidarity's success was attracting imitators
throughout the communist world, and inside the Soviet Union itself,
among ``Hungarians, Russians, the Ukrainians, people of the Baltic
republics, Armenians and Georgians, and in recent days, the East
Germans.''
   ``We wish them luck and rejoice at each success they achieve,''
he said.
   Walesa praised Soviet reforms, and said ``our task is viewed
with understanding by our eastern neighbors and their leader,
Mikhail Gorbachev.''
   ``This understanding lays foundations for new relation

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, bgng: So far xxx, to UPDATE and reflect passage
of another appropriations bill.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress rushed a temporary spending bill to
the White House on Wednesday to keep government agencies from
shutting down and falling victim to Congress' inability to finish
its budget business on time.
   On a 296-122 vote, the House sent the measure to the Senate,
which later adopted the measure on a voice vote. President Bush was
expected to sign the bill.
   The legislation provides money to keep federal programs
functioning through Monday. Otherwise, their spending authority
would have expired at the end of business Wednesday.
   The stopgap measure is necessary because lawmakers have failed
to finish the package of 13 annual spending bills for fiscal 1990,
which began Oct. 1.
   So far, five of the bills have been signed into law; two have
been vetoed by Bush; four are on the president's desk awaiting his
signature, and Congress is working on two others.
   ``At times it seems like we've been assigned the task of rolling
rocks up a hill, only to have those rocks roll back,'' said Rep.
Silvio Conte, R-Mass., ranking Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee.
   Congressional leaders hope to have finished work on all 13
spending bills by Monday. If not, yet another stopgap measure will
be needed. Lawmakers hope to complete their work for the year by
Wednesday and adjourn until January.
   The legislation is the third time in the last two months that
Congress has had to extend temporary spending authority. Lawmakers
passed one measure Sept. 28 providing stopgap funds through Oct.
25, and a second on Oct. 25. That measure expired Wednesday.

   Wilbert Rideau and Billy Wayne Sinclair,
convicted murderers with a bent for writing, won fame in the late
1970s and early '80s with articles in the Louisiana State
Penitentiary magazine The Angolite.
   The writings that concerns them today include legal briefs filed
in Sinclair's $100,000 federal lawsuit against Rideau, accusing him
of plagiarism in a book he edited and of trying to damage
Sinclair's journalistic reputation.
   ``Everything in this book was done properly,'' said Rideau, who
still is editor of The Angolite. ``I didn't claim to write anything
I didn't.
   ``Neither I, nor anyone else, has tried to damage Billy's
journalistic reputation. He did that to himself back in 1986 when
he became an undercover agent for the FBI while he was working as a
journalist.''
   Sinclair, 44, now jailed at the State Police Barracks in Baton
Rouge, said the lawsuit was a last resort. ``The only thing I want
is for the credit for my work to be protected and for Wilbert
Rideau not to claim the things I did.
   ``Nobody putting together a book using that many articles from
the Angolite could help but assume some of them were mine.''
   Sinclair's death sentence for a 1965 murder during a bungled
holdup was commuted to life in prison after the U.S. Supreme Court
threw out Louisiana's death penalty law. He left The Angolite in
1986 after going to the FBI when he was approached by a prison
employee who tried to sell him a pardon. In the ensuing scandals,
the head of the pardon board was sent to prison.
   ``I had three choices,'' Sinclair said. ``I could accept it,
ignore it, or report it to officials. If I had tried to report it
within the system I would have been dead in 30 days. If I had tried
to report it as a journalist they would have tried to discredit
what I did or lock me up.''
   After he cooperated in the investigation, he was transferred out
of Angola for his safety. He received a clemency recommendation
from the state Pardon Board, but Gov. Buddy Roemer, taking a hard
line on crime, rejected it.
   Rideau, 47, has been at Angola since he was condemned to die for
a 1961 bank robbery in which he killed a teller by slitting her
throat. His sentence was also commuted to life when the death
penalty was thrown out.
   Sinclair's lawsuit centers on a University of Southwestern
Louisiana text, ``The Wall Is Strong: Corrections In Louisiana,''
that Rideau edited with Burk Foster, a professor, and another
Angolite editor, Ron Wikberg. The textbook is a compilation of
newspaper and magazine articles and papers by the school's Center
For Criminal Justice Research. About half is from The Angolite.
   Sinclair contends that four of the articles should have carried
his byline.
   Rideau acknowledged that one should have.
   ``He won the George Polk award, the Silver Gavel Award from the
American Bar Association in 1980 for `A Prison Tragedy.' Leaving
his name off it was an innocent mistake. Hell, my name was left off
`Sexual Jungle,' which I won the George Polk award for. There are a
lot of mistakes in the book. We had to put it together by phone and
letters. It's not like we could take off and go to the printers
every time we needed to.''
   No matter who wrote them, Rideau said, ownership may belong to
the state.
   ``We're prisoners. We were sent to prison to work and to suffer.
Billy was sentenced to hard labor. He got a break and was sent to
The Angolite but he was paid for that work just as if he had gone
anywhere else. Can the guy who makes license plates claim they're
his? Can the prisoner who picks cotton go to the warden and tell
him how to use that cotton?''
   The book is sold only at the university bookstore. At $26.95, it
is not expected to make more than a few hundred dollars, Foster
said. Even if it does make a profit, the money will go to the
school.
   Rideau said he gets nothing from it but satisfaction, tainted
now by the suit he said reflects Sinclair's bitterness at being out
of the limelight.
   Meanwhile, The Angolite, which was a finalist for the Columbia
School of Journalism 1989 National Magazine Award and, along with
Barron's, received the American Bar Association award for
journalism, has rebuilt its credibility, he said. ``I have no war
with Billy and I don't want one. I understand there has always been
a certain resentment and jealousy on his part. It's sad when trying
to be like someone turns to envy.''
   Sinclair said he has no reason for envy, just worry about his
work.
   ``We were very close at one time. What Wilbert did for me when I
was in jail was brought to the attention of a lot of people and I'm
very grateful. This has never been a personal vendetta on my part.
He's the one that made it a vendetta. When I read that book,
though, I realized the only way I can protect my work is to go to
court.''

   Jeanne Sharp, whose ancestors lived and
farmed in this rural New York community before the American
Revolution, is learning a hard lesson about rebellion: Governments
often fight back.
   Sharp and more than 300 other residents who filed a lawsuit
trying to block construction of a garbage incinerator are in turn
being sued, by lawmakers.
   ``I've been thinking a lot about Ethan Allen,'' said Sharp. ``I
have some idea of what my ancestors went through to get here.
   ``If they can put up with it, so can I.''
   Residents sued Washington County and adjoining Warren County
last year over the proposed incinerator, which is to be built in
Hudson Falls, about 40 miles north of Albany, to burn garbage for
both counties. They contend that local officials approved the plan
without a proper public hearing.
   The counties and their industrial development agency
countersued, seeking $1.5 million from 320 plaintiffs, most of them
Washington County residents. Washington County later dropped out,
but Warren County and the IDA remain.
   The residents, recognizable around the area by the bright orange
``PLAINTIFF'' bumper stickers affixed to their cars, say the
countersuit was filed to harass them into dropping their lawsuit.
   Environmentalists say it could have national implications for
other citizen action groups that turn to the courts to challenge
controversial projects. The environmental movement even has a name
for it _ a SLAPP suit, or Strategic Lawsuit Against Public
Participation.
   ``It's a strategy to hush people up and stop them from speaking
out,'' said Lois Gibbs, who led the fight over the Love Canal toxic
dump in Niagara Falls and now runs the Virginia-based Citizens
Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste.
   ``This case stands out as the only one of its kind that I know
of where government chooses to sue its own people,'' said Will
Collette, Citizens Clearinghouse's SLAPP suit expert.
   Other SLAPP suits, which Collete calls ``legal terrorism,'' have
been brought across the country by private companies involved in
projects. ``The idea is to squash the opposition.''
   People who bring SLAPP suits don't expect to win them, he said.
``They all get dropped. They never go to trial. Warren County has
no expectation of winning its case.''
   In Washington County, some supervisors told people they might
lose their homes or cars as a result of the countersuit, the
plaintiffs claim.
   ``They're trying to harass us and intimidate us down to a
handful of manageable troublemakers,'' said Melody Brown, who
admits to being one of the more vocal incinerator opponents being
sued.
   The countersuit contends the citizens' lawsuit was frivolous and
that actions by the incinerator opponents, during the sale of bonds
for the project, cost the counties $1.5 million.
   ``At the original closing date for the bond sale, there were
committed purchasers. As the result of the activities of the
citizens, those contracts were abrogated, it was necessary to enter
into new contracts, and passage of time and a change in the market
brought a $1.5 million loss,'' said Benjamin Pratt, a Glens Falls
lawyer for the counties and IDA. That loss increased the cost of
the project and with it the cost of burning garbage.
   Now the incinerator opponents want to add more litigation to the
fray _ a federal civil rights lawsuit in response to the lawsuit
against them. They've hired Atlanta-based civil rights lawyer
Robert Remar.
   ``The First Amendment to the Constitution gives all of us the
right to freedom of speech, freedom of association and the right to
petition government for redress of grievances,'' said Remar. ``When
a government seeks to basically punish the citizens for having
exercised those rights, that's a violation of the Constitution.''
   Pratt said the counterclaim doesn't violate anyone's civil
rights.
   ``They have the right to speak with respect to the proceedings
and actions being taken by the government. They have a right to sue
their government if they feel that something is done improperly.
But they don't have the right to ... perform in such a fashion that
they interfere with the contractual rights that the government has
with third parties and cause a $1.5 million loss.''
   Hammond Robertson, chairman of the Warren County Board of
Supervisors, said he supports the counterclaim, as has a majority
of that board every time someone moves to drop it.
   ``I have to recognize that people have some strong feelings on
this issue,'' said Robertson. ``But there are 110,000 people in
these two counties. We have some obligation to the other 100,000
people.''
   While the lawsuits go on over the $80 million incinerator _
resolution isn't expected until some time next year _ excavation is
nearing completion at the plant site next to the Hudson River.
   The main point of the original lawsuit, whether there was a
public hearing on the project, is still in dispute. While Robertson
said a hearing wasn't required, Pratt said the two-county IDA held
one.
   Stephanie Wenk, another active incinerator opponent, said the
IDA hearing lasted just 45 minutes and that everyone wasn't allowed
to speak.
   ``The public hearing was a sham,'' said Wenk, who has been known
to tie a gag over her mouth at supervisors' meetings. ``They let 11
people speak out of 49 ... Then they just banged the gavel and that
was it.''

   Jean-Pierre Aumont confesses he had never
read Charles Dickens' ``A Tale of Two Cities'' until he was asked
to star in a new four-part miniseries for television.
   In the story of the French Revolution, Aumont stars as the
ill-fated Dr. Manette, who was confined for 18 years in the
Bastille. He was imprisoned for denouncing two aristocrats who had
fatally wounded a young couple he had treated.
   The Anglo-French production of ``A Tale of Two Cities'' begins
Sunday on Mobil's ``Masterpiece Theatre'' on PBS.
   It also stars James Wilby as Sidney Carton, Serena Gordon as
Lucie Manette, Xavier DeLuc as Charles Darnay, John Mills as Jarvis
Lorry, Anna Massey as Miss Pross, Kathie Kriegel as Madame Defarge,
Gerald Klein as her husband and Jean-Marc Bory as the Marquis de
St. Evremonde. Philippe Monnier directed.
   ``It is a huge book and I had never read it,'' said Aumont. ``It
took me many days to get through it, but it was worth it.''
   Dr. Manette is in poor health when he is released from the
Bastille. His daughter, Lucie, takes him to England to recover his
health.
   Later, Manette's son-in-law, Charles Darnay, is arrested and,
Aumont explained, ``He returns to France to save his life, which he
does.''
   The series was filmed in Manchester, England, and Bordeaux,
France, which stood in for Paris.
   ``I don't think they could have done it in Paris,'' he said.
``They had to find a place where the streets had not changed.''
   The French-born Aumont began his career on the stage in San
Francisco at the age of 17. He co-starred with Katherine Cornell in
``Roseberg.'' At the start of World War II he returned to France.
   ``I fought in Tunisia, Italy and landed in Southern France,'' he
said. ``I landed with the Americans and for one whole day I was the
only French soldier in France. After the war, I returned to the
United States and made more films.''
   He co-starred with Leslie Caron and Mel Ferrer in ``Lili,'' and
on Broadway he co-starred with Vivien Leigh in ``Tovarich'' and Al
Pacino in ``Camino Real.''
   Aumont talked about the miniseries on a brief visit from Paris,
where he lives with his wife, Marisa Pavan. They have three
children, all of whom are American citizens. One son lives here and
a son and daughter live in Paris.
   He recently completed a movie filmed in Aix-en-Provence called
``The Fighting Frenchman.''
   ``It's about the war and the Resistance and the collaboration,''
he said. ``I play a man who is beginning to believe in Marshal
Petain and think the Germans aren't so bad. Then he has a change of
heart and becomes a follower of Charles de Gaulle.
   ``When I met with the director he told me it would be the story
of a man who enlists in the Free French Forces. I said, `Oh, that's
easy. That's what I did in real life.' There was a long silence and
he said, `Yes, but you play the father.' I had simply forgotten
about my age.''
   Another completed film due for release soon is ``Les Grandes
Familles.''
   In recent years, Aumont has appeared on French television
regularly and on American TV in such shows as ``Hart to Hart'' and
``The Love Boat.''
   ``I did `Gigi' on the stage in London for a year,'' he said.
``That was great fun. I had seven songs and I'm not really a
singer. I told my agent, `I'm not a singer.' He said, `What about
Rex Harrison? What about Maurice Chevalier?' I let myself be easily
convinced.''

   GEOGRAPHIC SPECIALS _ To help mark National Geography Awareness
Week, National Geographic Television announced plans for four PBS
specials starting in January. The first explores the endangered
Amazon rain forest, the second the Indonesian island of Bali, the
third the Linyanti region of Botswana, and the final program in
April the Soviet city Leningrad. The programs mark the 25th
anniversary of the National Geographic Specials.
   NASTY BOYS _ NBC has ordered 12 episodes of ``Nasty Boys'' from
Universal Television for the midseason. It's based on the North Las
Vegas Police Department's special drug enforcement team, which is
noted for its unorthodox tactics. The two-hour pilot movie on Sept.
22 beat the season premiere of CBS' ``Dallas.'' It was NBC's
highest Friday-night rating in two years.

<HEAD>Exiled Painter, Rural Sculptor Captivate Johannesburg Art World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two elderly black men _ one an
exile in France, the other a faith healer from a tiny village _ are
being heralded by South Africa's white-dominated art establishment
as two of the country's greatest artists.
   By coincidence, the first major retrospective exhibitions of
Gerard Sekoto's paintings and Jackson Hlungwani's sculptures are
simultaneously on display this month in Johannesburg. Critics have
greeted both with superlative praise.
   One reviewer described the Hlungwani show as ``the most
important sculpture exhibition yet held in South Africa.'' Sekoto,
wrote another critic, ``is one of the greatest figures of
20th-century South African art.''
   Sekoto, 75, lives in a home for retired artists outside Paris
and has not returned to South Africa since going into self-imposed
exile in 1947. His finest works, critics agree, are gentle scenes
of black urban life painted in South Africa in the eight years
before he emigrated.
   Many of his paintings depict black and mixed-race inner-city
neighborhoods in Cape Town and Johannesburg that later were razed
by the government and reconstructed as whites-only districts.
   The exhibition of 138 of his works, many of them loaned from
private collections, has drawn large crowds to the Johannesburg Art
Gallery, the largest exhibition facility in the country's largest
city.
   ``It has taken about as long for Sekoto to attain public
recognition in his own native country as it has for the
Johannesburg Art Gallery to wake up to the fact that whites can
never carry the full weight of this country's political, economic
and cultural self-fulfillment,'' said Eskia Mphahlele, a friend of
the painter and former professor of African literature at the
University of the Witwatersrand, at the opening of the exhibition.
   The New Nation, an anti-apartheid newspaper, said in its review
that for decades Sekoto was deprived of proper recognition
``because of the one-sided focus which was placed on the work of
white artists by galleries, critics, art historians and authorities
blindfolded by apartheid.''
   Hlungwani, 66, is the son of a mineworker, never had formal
education, has 12 children, and lost a finger in an industrial
accident when he worked as a laborer. He says he decided to take up
sculpting after experiencing a religious vision.
   ``I do the work of God by carving,'' he said in an interview
earlier this year. ``Art comes from all my body.''
   Most of his works are carved from wood found in the area around
two improvised temples he has built in a village in Gazankulu, a
black homeland near South Africa's northeastern border with
Mozambique. His creations include angels, crucifixes and many fish
_ which he considers an important Christian symbol.
   More than 200 of his works are on display at a converted
industrial warehouse in one of Johannesburg's oldest districts.
   ``His sculptures have transformed an ordinary old factory ...
into a magical place of reverence,'' wrote Kendell Geers, a critic
for The Star, the country's largest-selling daily. ``The show
certainly sets a standard for South African art for the future.''
   The New Nation has devoted full-page spreads to each of the
shows.
   ``It's an exciting and joyful time for art lovers in
Johannesburg,'' the newspaper said. ``Two current exhibitions, both
unforgettable, are giving them the first comprehensive look at two
of South Africa's greatest artists.''

<TEXT>
   Still water runs deep for Art Garfunkel, the
high, clear voice of Simon and Garfunkel, and ``Still Water'' is
the title of his new book of prose poems.
   ``Does it help to feel better about a painful memory by writing
about it? Not really. It doesn't have anything to do with it,'' he
said. Some of the 84 poems in the book concern the suicide of his
girlfriend, Laurie Bird, in 1979.
   ``It seems that the artists' agenda is to be true to feelings
and emotions, fearlessly, so that we can all recognize ourselves,''
he said in an interview. ``Fearlessly is the key word.
   ``We give ourselves a catharsis by recognizing the many colors
of human nature, including the darks. My notion of such an artist
is one who has the bravery to deal with the complexity of the human
heart and psyche. That's where I'm coming from, to the best of my
ability.''
   From 1983 through 1987, the poetry muse kept biting Garfunkel.
``Then the pen dried up. I know what the reason is. In 1987 I
started making the `Lefty' album. I was moving from the world of
words to the world of music. I guess I reorganized my creative
impulses to a new direction.''
   Garfunkel's older brother, Jules, urged him to take his poems to
editor Leslie Wells, who thought they should be a book, which has
been published by E.P. Dutton.
   ``The poems are in four categories, that's how I look at them,''
he said. ``One is the spirit of traveling. One is how I work.''
Poems 59 through 65 concern ``The Animals' Christmas,'' an album of
songs by Jimmy Webb, sung by Garfunkel and Amy Grant in 1986.
   ``One is philosophical speculations. The fourth category is
memory of Laurie Bird. Catharsis is a notion I find popular. I
don't know if I can connect with that. Had I never written about
her, would I have been more blocked? I would have thought all these
things. My friends know how deeply I was affected by her, when I
loved her and when I lost her.
   ``Time makes things fade,'' Garfunkel said. ``I love Kim now.
The memory of Laurie is mercifully fading. It is giving me a break.
I have a chance to live life now. When I wrote these, in the
mid-'80s, is not really where I'm at now.''
   On Sept. 18, 1988, Garfunkel and Kathryn ``Kim'' Cermak were
married in the Brooklyn Botanical Garden. She had sung in the group
Lime, worked as a model and currently is developing a solo show.
   ``I had a real fear of marriage,'' Garfunkel said. ``I was one
of the real tough cases. When it came to trust in that area, only
the great Kathryn could have relaxed me on that, with a lot of love
and niceness.
   ``I'm sure I'm the millionth person to fear the wonderful. If
something comes along that offers you a major increase in your
life, you say, `Can I get back to you on this?'
   ``The day I said, `I'm going to marry Kathryn,' was the day I
clarified my life. ... I've been so reclusive in the '80s. I've
been reclusive long enough.''
   That doesn't mean that he'll start writing songs. ``I once had
seven or eight lines of a poem and I liked the way it laid. I
thought, `Let me turn it into a song.' After two hours of laboring,
all the inspiration dried up.''
   But he may tour more.
   In 1988 Garfunkel toured with British musicians in England and
Japan. This fall he's singing in Europe. ``I'm trying out a leaner
musical line. I'm going to try to work with one guitar and one
piano, often not playing at the same time, on what I call `the
less-is-more tour.' If I can be in really good voice, let me clear
out the backing so I can be heard in all my nuances.''
   In January, he'll do 12 shows in Japan with a full band.
   In the past, he has done more recording than live concerts.
``The studio has always been the fun for me. You're working against
your own perfectionism. You can erase it till it's right.
   ``But I've cooled out. When we (Simon and Garfunkel) were in
junior high school, we wanted a hit. The desire to have a hit calms
down after you have success.''
   Garfunkel likes to travel.
   ``I like to ventilate my intensity. I want air, elbow room and
the sweep of nature as an antidote. I like crossing the Atlantic by
ship after recordiing in a studio.''
   He also is walking across the United States, a bit at a time. He
left his apartment one day, crossed the George Washington Bridge,
walked for nine days and came home, picking up later exactly where
he left off in West Virginia.
   ``Kim came along in West Virginia and northern Missouri. I
usually do it myself. I'm now about 25 miles from Lincoln, Neb.,''
he said.
   ``I take the smallest paved roads I find. In general, human
kindness goes up in the smaller areas. In remote areas, more people
stop and offer a ride.'' Garfunkel always refuses.
   He admits that his walk is ``the rich man's way to do it.'' He
goes with an assistant who rents a car. When it's dark, the
assistant picks Garfunkel up and backtracks to the nearest motel.
   Garfunkel sent Paul Simon, with whom relations have sometimes
been strained, a copy of his book. Simon said he liked it.
   ``He's a man of integrity,'' Garfunkel said. ``He could have
avoided saying anything.
   ``We went to a Yankee game last summer. Kim sat between us. It
was really nice. There's nothing like time. It does it's own sweet,
soothing thing.''

<HEAD>Advisers Would Raise the Quayle Profile, Avoid Another Dent to Image</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C.(AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To a golfer, a mulligan is a
second chance, an invitation to hit a bad shot over again and
pretend the first one never happened. Golfing with Republican
governors, Vice President Dan Quayle said he didn't want one
because ``mulligans are for Democrats.''
   There are no mulligans in national politics, where Quayle might
find one handy now and then. In that arena, any errant move is
marked indelibly on the scorecard. That means no mistakes go
unpenalized, especially for a political figure whose confidence and
performance ratings are persistently low, as Quayle's are.
   That pressure doesn't let up; one associate sees the stress on
Quayle as the vice president strives to boost his standing, knowing
that any slipup or misspoken word will be magnified into another
dent in the image.
   At the Republican Governors Association conference this week,
even the praise pointed to the problem. Quayle's friends were at
pains to plug his performance and his potential as a national
leader, even when it didn't quite fit the moment.
   Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina introducing him
at a casual Sunday night reception, said the vice president ``will
make a very fine place in history.'' Republican National Chairman
Lee Atwater tossed into his remarks to the governors on Monday the
observation that Quayle ``is doing a very fine job and could not
have more confidence and support from the president.''
   In such situations, some Republicans are protesting too much.
   After all, Quayle has solid backing where it really counts.
President Bush has said flatly that Quayle will be his 1992 running
mate. That gives the vice president seven years to do his job and
enhance his standing.
   In the changeable world of politics, that is a very long time _
half again as long as Quayle's entire political career to date.
   Even though the adverse polls clearly sting, Quayle is up to a
joke about his political standing.
   ``A year and one week ago, President George Bush rode to victory
on my coattails,'' he told the governors.
   He spoke of his wife's interest in disaster relief efforts:
   ``Marilyn has a lot of experience in disaster preparedness;
she's lived with me for 17 years.''
   But the banter isn't always easy in the face of public opinion
surveys indicating that a majority of Americans do not think Quayle
qualified to succeed to the presidency, which is a vice president's
one crucial role, and that nearly half think he should be replaced
on the 1992 Republican ticket.
   President Bush has said that will not happen, making the
commitment publicly. ``He's doing a very good job, an oustanding
job ...exactly what I want him to do,'' Bush said in an interview
with the Dallas Morning News early this month.
   The vice president says unfavorable polls will not affect the
way he does his job.
   ``I'm not going to do anything differently no matter what the
polls say,'' Quayle said Monday in an interview with a group of
reporters. ``I'm going to work as I believe a vice president should
work, that is, first and foremost, with complete loyalty to the
president, for the advancement of his agenda, in his interest, and
that's what I'm doing.''
   That job description does not preclude a more aggressive effort
to strengthen his own standing and improve his own image. Quayle
and his allies have maintained that his image problem stems largely
from memories of the Democratic attack on him during the 1988
campaign, but it has been over a year now and the numbers aren't
any better.
   As a result, some Quayle advisers want him to raise his
television profile, appearing more frequently on the talk and
question-and-answer programs. Those appearances have been held to a
handful during the first year of the administration. There may be
more in the months ahead.
   And there certainly will be more political outings in 1990, with
34 senators, 36 governors and the House of Representatives all up
for election. Campaigning for party candidates is a traditional
assignment for vice presidents.
   That means the voters will be seeing more of Quayle. They'll
know him better; his challenge is to convince them to like him
better.

<HEAD>Ford's Executive Succession Plan Almost Unique</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The realignment of Ford Motor's executive suite,
in which an older chief executive will replace a younger one and
the four top positions will be held by men age 55 or older, is
almost unique in recent history.
   It has upset patterns established over three decades,
conceivably put another one in motion and presented a challenge to
those who analyze and seek to understand the executive suite.
   ``It is the most unusual succession pattern of the 35 years in
which I have audited executive mobility and succession in top
corporations,'' said Professor Eugene Jennings, an authority on
such matters.
   Older executives have been favored over youth in the past,
Jennings said, but usually because directors lacked confidence that
younger ones were ready, or because a company was rebuilding and
sought to avoid radical change.
   He indicated this was not the situation at Ford and speculated
that a feeling developing on corporate boards _ that many companies
are losing experience and wisdom through early retirements _ may
have played a role.
   In the Ford realignment, chairman and chief executive Donald
Petersen, 63, will resign early in 1990 and be replaced by Vice
Chairman Harold Poling, 64.
   The chief executive's office also would include Philip E. Benton
Jr., 60, as president and chief operating officer, Allan Gilmour,
55, as head of worldwide automotive works, and Stanley Seneker, 58,
as chief financial officer.
   Jennings, a Michigan State University professor of management
and a consultant to boards on succession policy, said that over the
past three decades the typical age has been 55 years for new
chairmen and 48 years for new presidents.
   In his view, Poling's age presents him with a difficult
situation in which he is denied the ``open-ended tenure'' that a
new chief executive usually needs in which to make an imprint.
   That situation could become more complicated, Jennings believes,
because history shows that in the rare instances in which
corporations preferred age over youth the seasoning of younger
executives was impeded and frustrated.
   If Petersen has indeed ushered in a cultural revolution at Ford,
says Jennings, ``then now is the time to use some of these senior
positions to grow future top management.'' That ``is what
conventional planning dictates.''
   Noting that the chief executive's office now will be filled by
four finance-oriented managers, Jennings observed it would be
logical that a marketing or manufacturing executive be moved in
among them to benefit from their knowledge.
   In the past when older financial people remained in top
positions, said Jennings, it usually indicated the corporate
directors felt the risk of change far outweighed the need for fresh
ideas.
   He noted that Ford, which earlier became the most profitable
American automobile company, recently suffered declines in its
quarterly profits and that it might indeed feel the future demands
financial wisdom and experience.
   But Jennings, who pioneered in mobility studies during the
1950s, said the notion cannot be ruled out that Ford might be in
the vanguard of a new appreciation of age and competency.

   Kathy Thorpe wants a job. She wants a
place to live in a drug-free neighborhood where she and her two
toddlers will feel safe. And she wants to get off welfare.
   ``Ever since I've had these kids, I've had this fear _ that I'd
always be financially dependent,'' said Thorpe, 28. ``These kids
are depending on me, and I don't want to let them down.''
   Despite a failed marriage, the lack of a job and no day care for
her 2{-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son, she has a better
chance to fulfill that goal now, thanks to an experimental job
training effort that rewards determination with cash bonuses.
   ``I would love to get into computers,'' Thorpe said. ``I'd like
to try to be a word processor.''
   Officials here in Montgomery County, frustrated by the lack of
participation in job-training programs, started a three-year pilot
program in July offering cash incentives of up to $1,000 to
motivate welfare recipients to go to school and get jobs.
   ``It's no longer good enough to just give people a (welfare)
check,'' said Robert S. Caulk, director of the Department of Social
Services for the county, which borders Washington, D.C. ``We've got
to do more to provide them with the wherewithal to get off of
welfare, to break that cycle of dependence.''
   The program, which targets those who have been receiving Aid to
Families with Dependent Children for at least three years and
low-income teen-age parents, is the first in the nation to offer
cash incentives for job training, Caulk said.
   Participants who complete a goal, such as consistently attending
a training class or earning a high school equivalency diploma,
receive payments ranging from $25 to $200, with a limit of $1,000
per person per year. The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health
and Human Services agreed to waive requirements that would have
deducted the incentive payments from welfare or food stamp payments.
   The program will cost nearly $1 million in federal, state and
county funds, Caulk said. But the annual savings in welfare
benefits alone would be about $5,000 for each three-member family
that becomes economically self-sufficient, he said.
   Social workers set up goals and payments, taking into
consideration each person's abilities and motivation level.
   ``We're trying to empower case managers to have the flexibility
to say, `For this client, just showing up five days in a row is an
accomplishment,''' he said. ``That person would be rewarded at the
end of five days. Somebody else may have a totally different kind
of package. They may have to score well in word processing or
assembly or retail training. Others may get one payment to complete
the class.''
   About 600 people will participate in the experimental program,
with half receiving cash incentives and the other half acting as a
control group.
   ``The federal government suggested we keep payments quiet'' so
the control group wouldn't know others were receiving payments for
completing the same tasks they did without pay, Caulk said. ``But
that is impossible because they're all in the same classes, and we
want them to discuss their progress and encourage each other.''
   Wealthy Montgomery County has tried other projects in the past.
Three years ago, it gave welfare recipients vouchers worth up to
$250 to pay for food, utilities or other bills in exchange for
their participation in job-training programs. The dropout rate was
more than 50 percent.
   The federal government's approach to the problem is to require
certain welfare recipients to attend job-training classes to keep
their public assistance checks coming.
   But Caulk said even the threat of losing payments they now
receive has not helped motivate some welfare recipients to seek
advancement.
   Last year, Congress passed the Family Support Act, requiring
states to set up large-scale education, job-training and work
programs to make welfare recipients self-sufficient.
   Maryland was the first state to implement the act in all
counties, said J.C. Shay, spokesman for the state Department of
Human Resources, who added that state officials are optimistic
about Montgomery County's program.
   ``We're anxious to see how the cash incentives will impact on
the welfare recipients' participation, motivation and continuation
in the program,'' he said.
   Federal officials are taking a wait-and-see attitude.
   ``We're not in favor of the program or against it, but if it is
successful we'd like to see it tried in other areas,'' said Peter
Germanis of the federal Low-Income Opportunity Board, which
includes officials from several federal agencies who are working to
improve the nation's welfare system. ``And if it were to succeed in
several areas, it could be used for reforming the national wefare
system.''
   Already, the program has surpassed Caulk's expectations.
   ``Our goal was to have 40 people in the first (job-training)
class. So far, 61 people have enrolled,'' he said. ``Going on past
experience, we could lose half in the next month.''
   If the program works, however, the cash incentives would
encourage them to stay, he said.
   ``This has never been tried before, so if we find that the
payments make no difference, even that is worth knowing,'' Caulk
said. ``Then we can sit down and think of something else to try.''
   Thorpe said she is confident the program will work.
   ``When people ask me, `What have you been up to?' I don't say,
`Oh, nothin', just hangin' around.' I say: `I've been busy. I'm
going to school. I'm going to get a job.'''
   And although she'd seek training even without being paid, she
said, ``The money really comes in handy.''

   For some teen-agers, it's hard work not getting
pregnant _ so hard they are being paid $1 a day for their efforts.
   Each Thursday afternoon, 13 teen-age girls pick up $7 and snack
on chips and soda at the La Mariposa Health Care Center, a Denver
General Hospital clinic in the low-income, largely Hispanic
neighborhood where most of them grew up.
   Twelve of them already have at least one child, and many bring
their babies along. This is a program for girls who have gotten
pregnant by age 16 and know the consequences of teen pregnancy
firsthand.
   ``It's an incentive program and it's a support group,'' says
Margo Daly, assistant director of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky
Mountains, which sponsors the program.
   ``In the past two years, out of more than 20 girls, we've had
only two pregnancies. That's really successful for the kind of
group we're dealing with.''
   The program has sparked interest around the country, and spawned
a similar program in San Mateo, Calif., Daly says.
   The girls use the weekly sessions to talk about child-rearing,
school, dating _ providing each other the support that they might
otherwise try to find having another baby, organizers say.
   Consciously or unconsciously, they are addicted to motherhood,
says Dr. Jeffrey Dolgan, a child psychologist at Children's
Hospital who thought up the ``Dollar-A-Day'' program several years
ago after directing a home for troubled youths and seeing a steady
stream of teen mothers come through.
   ``Their deprivation and emptiness _ their longing for something
uniquely their own'' compels girls in their situation to get
pregnant, Dolgan says. ``That, plus weak refusal skills and a
passive understanding of their role as women.''
   Dolgan says weekly support from others like them helps the girls
overcome a psychological longing for a child. The money and
refreshments are added incentive, a psychological ploy he says is
too often overlooked in addressing the nationwide teen pregnancy
problem.
   The girls don't like seeing themselves as deprived, but some
agree they wanted to get pregnant.
   ``My cousin had a baby and I felt I kind of lost her. I felt I
needed someone with me all the time,'' said Jo Ann Armijo, 17,
holding her 5-month-old son, Jose, on her lap at one Thursday
afternoon session.
   Now, she attends high school through the city's Teen Parent
Education Network, which provides some day-care. She doesn't want
to get pregnant again, because she wants to become a veterinarian
and to be able to provide for Jose, she said.
   Armijo said the money isn't the reason she and other girls come
to the clinic each week, although ``it gives them something to
think about.''
   For her, the session ``gives me a chance to let some of my
feelings out _ or if I need to know something about the babies'' _
things like teething and heat rash, or what to do when you want to
go to school and can't find a babysitter.
   Planned Parenthood estimates the program costs about $600 per
girl annually, paid for by donations. Daly says that makes it a
cheap alternative to teen pregnancy.
   Last year, Gov. Roy Romer's Initiative on Teen Pregnancy
reported: ``The cost to Colorado totals over $200 million each year
in Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, Medicaid
and other public assistance for families headed by women who began
their childbearing as teens.''
   The state health department reported that one in 10 babies born
in Colorado in 1987 was born to a teen-ager, and teen-age
pregnancies resulted in more than 5,700 births and 3,000 abortions.
   Maria Olivia Valdez, 17, has come to the sessions since her son,
Chris, was born a year and a half ago. For her, it's a welcome
break in a week filled with high school, a job at a grocery store
and the responsibilities of motherhood.
   ``I didn't want to get pregnant, but I was happy because I like
kids, especially newborns,'' she said.
   She enjoys being with the other girls. ``They're your same age
and they have babies, too, so they know how you're feeling.
   ``A lot of girls think, `I might as well have another baby since
I can't go out and work much (with one child already).' Here, you
realize it'll be harder to take on another baby _ it'll stop your
career life ... You just won't feel right living off of your
parents or your in-laws.''
   The girls, as young as 13, can stay in the Dollar-A-Day program
for two years or until they are 18. Most take high-school classes,
and some have jobs, counselor Diane Medina says.
   Seven dollars a week doesn't go far, but can pay for diapers or
a snack on the way home, several girls said.
   Valdez, unusual in the group in that she lives with her son's
father, another teen-ager, said she used to spend the $7 a week on
laundry and diapers, but now saves it for her son.

   The coming decade will be rich in both challenge
and opportunity: The greenhouse effect. Ozone. AIDS. The rich-poor
gap. The genetic code. New materials. Superconductors.
Supercomputers. This summary article is the final installment in a
periodic series, ``The '90s,'' looking ahead to the upcoming 10
years in the environment, medicine, technology and society.

<TEXT>
   In the decade of the 1990s, perhaps as never before, human fate
rests in human hands.
   Few periods in history have presented such clear choices between
promise and peril, and experts predict that civilization in the
21st century and beyond may well be shaped by global decisions made
in the 1990s.
   ``Human beings now have the power to control their own fate to a
degree that they've never had before,'' said Edward Cornish,
president of the World Future Society.
   ``Unfortunately, we do not know how to handle this power very
well. We don't have very well developed systems for managing the
world as a whole.''
   The World Future Society, an organization that monitors trends
and forecasts their effects, annually surveys the views of
specialists on the major problems in years ahead.
   Topping the list of challenges for the 1990s: environmental
damage to the Earth's climate, land, water and atmosphere.
   ``In 1986, the cluster of environmental problems was No. 3 on
this list of fears,'' said Michael Marien, editor of the survey.
Now, he said, ``it has clearly become the leading problem area.''
   World Watch, an environmental research organization, agrees with
the assessment. In its annual ``State of the World,'' the
organization calls the 1990s ``the turnaround decade,'' and warns,
``By many measures, time is running out.''
   Global warming, because it affects all else, is of the most
concern to futurists and to many environmentalists.
   Scientists agree that human action, principally burning fossil
fuels and the slash-and-burn clearing of vast forest lands, is
increasing the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In what is called
the ``greenhouse effect,'' carbon dioxide and some other gases act
like a global thermal blanket, allowing sunlight to strike Earth,
but trapping heat that otherwise would radiate back into space.
   Eventually, the theory goes, the planet will warm, polar ice
will melt, climates will change, oceans will rise, agricultural
patterns will be disrupted and food supplies will decline.
   Scientists disagree about whether the greenhouse effect is
already causing the Earth to overheat. But it is accepted that only
a determined effort to reduce fossil fuel use and halt destruction
of forests will reverse rising levels of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere.
   Human actions also are thought to be causing the depletion in
the stratosphere of the ozone layer that shields against
ultraviolet solar radiation. Chlorofluorocarbons, a widely used
chemical family, becomes a pollutant in the atmosphere, destroying
ozone molecules and weakening the UV shield. This can lead to more
skin cancer, weaker plants and poorer harvests.
   Industry and governments already have recognized this problem
and have signed agreements to eventually stop use of
chlorofluorocarbons, but atoms of this chemical can survive for 50
years, assuring that ozone depletion will be a problem well beyond
the 1990s.
   Governments also are taking action against other environmental
problems _ acid rain, water pollution, garbage disposal and the
extinction of species. How well these measures succeed is, again,
an issue of the 1990s that will depend on human will.
   Worldwide economic turbulence is second on the list of impending
worries, according to the World Future Society survey.
   The growing chasm between rich and poor, between debt-ridden,
overpopulated Third World nations and the vigorous economies of
developed nations may sharply intensify in the new decade.
   But for America, experts see the `90s as an era of prosperity.
   ``The 1990s will be a decade of solid economic growth ... and
the U.S. will continue to be the most influential nation in
technology, trade and political leadership,'' predict economists
Austin H. Kiplinger and Knight A. Kiplinger in their book ``America
in the Global '90s.''
   The trick, said Cornish, will be in finding ways to allow the
poorer nations to share in the good times.
   Nuclear war, long considered the greatest threat to the world's
future, is third on the list of future fears.
   The specialists believe this concern has receded because of the
Cold War thaw, but they warn that the missiles, East and West, are
still poised, and the road to a sure and certain peace is not in
place.
   Fourth on the World Future Society list of problems for the
1990s: the epidemic of drug abuse in America, a concern not even
mentioned in earlier surveys by the society.
   Cocaine and its insidious first cousin, crack, have turned many
urban neighborhoods into marketplaces for addiction, with murder a
nightly event, and crimes routinely committed to support drug
habits. Marijuana is grown illegally in many parts of the United
States, and heroin continues to hook the young.
   President Bush has pledged a war to shut down the illegal trade,
and other nations are battling powerful drug cartels. The results
are still uncertain, and the effort is sure to extend into the
1990s, and perhaps beyond.
   The futurists rank the AIDS epidemic as the fifth-worst problem
of the new decade, although some medical experts would put it at
the top.

   In a two-year study that used mathematical models to project the
course of the plague, the Hudson Institute warned that acquired
immune deficiency syndrome is ``a catastrophe ... sweeping over
America.''
   The institute, a distinguished think tank, predicts that by the
end of the 1990s more than 1.5 million Americans will have died of
AIDS and that, unless new tactics are used, up to 14.5 million
Americans will be infected with the AIDS virus by 2002.
   ``Nothing can totally avert this coming catastrophe,'' the study
says. ``Medical science can ease the suffering and slow the
progression of the disease, but no `cure' is on the horizon. ...
Unchecked, AIDS will kill more Americans in the next decade than
have died in combat in all of the nation's wars.''
   AIDS has peaked in the homosexual community and is rampant among
people who inject drugs, but the study forecast that in the 1990s
the disease will surge among heterosexuals, becoming an
overwhelming plague of the young and poor.
   The study says that only through a major change in society's
sexual patterns is there hope of reducing the toll of AIDS, which
is caused by a virus spread mostly through sexual intercourse.
   Thus, AIDS, as with many other problems of the 1990s, can be
controlled by human will.
   Despite the litany of concerns for the new decade, the 1990s
also offer great promise.
   In medicine, scientists are beginning to crack the genetic code
and learn how to change the fundamental blueprint of life.
   Plant genes are being manipulated to improve yield and fight
insects and disease, promising more food untainted by pesticides in
the new decade.
   The complex human genome _ the complete set of genes _ also is
being mapped, and scientists are already finding specific genes
that cause or facilitate disease. Eventually, though probably
beyond the 1990s, medicine hopes to replace the defective genes of
illness with the normal genes of health.
   Improved techniques and new drugs even now in testing will
enable doctors in the 1990s to transplant virtually any organ and
to even more vigorously combat heart disease and cancer, ancient
killers already in retreat.
   A revolution in materials science is under way and is sure to
accelerate into the 1990s. Lightweight but strong plastics and
ceramics are replacing metals in airplanes, cars and construction.
Superconducters, composites that can carry electricity without
resistance, are being developed at laboratories worldwide, offering
the promise of more efficient power transmission, faster computers
and high-speed rail transport.
   In electronics, a new wave of scientists matured in the
generation of the silicon chip will apply their expertise to an
already flourishing field. They'll find new uses for the smart
chip, integrating it even more thoroughly into household gadgets,
automobiles and educational tools. Some experts predict that
personal computers will perform hundreds of new jobs and become as
essential to the home of the 1990s as the telephone.
   Supercomputers are being teamed with new mathematics to allow
scientists to model even the most complex and random events. This
may hold the key to a fundamental understanding of the weather, of
earthquakes and of economic trends. How does smoke from a stack in
Pittsburgh affect the weather in New Zealand? What does a change in
ocean currents near Peru mean to wheat harvests in Kansas? The
improved science of math modeling may yield answers in the 1990s.
   America's decade in space centers on construction of space
station Freedom, an orbiting laboratory that will give astronauts a
permanent place to experiment in weightlessness and to test systems
for a prospective voyage to Mars in the next century.
   Building the station still is an uncertainty, depending on the
determination of Congress. But the 1990s will still witness
American space spectaculars.
   Two space probes, Magellan and Galileo, are already on their way
to Venus and Jupiter, carrying new, more sophisticated instruments
to explore those distant worlds. In 1992, another probe will be
sent to Mars. The Hubble telescope, to be launched next year, will
be able to study star galaxies 14 billion light years away, looking
farther back in time than ever before was possible.
   Wise use of promising technologies can help overcome many of the
obvious problems of the 1990s, but Cornish said an international
effort, as never before, will be necessary.
   ``There are solutions for any of the problems, but not quick,
simple and easy solutions,'' he said. ``They require international
cooperation and we don't know yet how to get international
cooperation.
   ``We (human beings) are getting better at it,'' he added. ``And
I think there are good reasons for optimism for the future.''
   But that future, he said, may well turn, like a jeweled hinge,
on decisions made in the decade of the 1990s.

<HEAD>1990 Hyundai Sonata GLS: Surprising Room, Performance</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Forget what you know about Hyundais. Just get inside the
carmaker's 1990 Sonata.
   Otherwise, you'll spend 5 minutes walking around this roomy,
mid-size car, convinced someone stuck the wrong nameplate on the
door.
   The test car, a Hyundai Sonata GLS with leather interior and V-6
engine, showed the South Korean carmaker has considerable talents
beyond the little low-end subcompact Excel it has been selling in
the United States since 1986.
   The Sonata felt big inside and acted big, with a 3-liter,
multi-port, fuel-injected six-cylinder engine teamed with
four-speed automatic overdrive transmission that delivered up to
142 horsepower on demand rather smoothly. I even made the tires
squeal a few times when I really tried to gun it.
   Front seats were roomy, and back seat space was impressive. With
the front seats moved up a bit, I could even stretch out my legs in
the back seat. With the front seats back a bit, I still had decent
legroom. Headroom and shoulder space in back also were commendable.
   In fact, the Sonata's 99.7 cubic feet of passenger space is
bigger than that of some other sedans such as the Toyota Camry.
   Exterior styling on the Sonata was subdued, not exactly
expressive, but certainly the car has a nice look.
   Suspension and handling is capable. The car does a good job of
cushioning harsh bumps with its rather spongy ride.
   Inside, the rear-seat armrests offered storage space, big side
windows added to the roomy feel and the ventilation system was
powerful. The button to pop open the trunk was neatly tucked on the
underside of the driver's armrest, so you don't have to hunt for it
in the glovebox as in some domestic cars.
   Best of all, the base price for a 1990 Sonata with manual
transmission is $9,999, making it a potent price competitor in the
mid-size sedan segment.
   In contrast, the Mitsubishi Galant sedan with manual
transmission starts at $10,989 and the Toyota Camry sedan with
manual transmission starts at $11,588.
   At that Toyota price, you're close to the upscale Sonata GLS
with manual transmission, which starts at $12,349. And the GLS
model includes tilt steering, cruise control, power door locks and
windows and illuminated vanity mirror as standard equipment.
   The GLS test car, with options that included leather interior,
air conditioning and premium radio, topped out at $15,849.
   Not bad for a roomy, V-6-powered car that can comfortably and
sensibly be used for family jaunts around town, vacation travel or
trips to work.
   That should appeal to likely buyers of the Sonata, most of whom
will be men (55 percent of buyers), with a median age of 40, and
married (70 percent of buyers), according to the company.
   Thirty-three percent of buyers are likely to be college-educated
and median income is expected to be $32,000.
   I did find a couple of annoyances in the test car. The power
antenna made five or six loud, thumping sounds whenever it went up
or down. And, as a passenger pointed out, the open-close
adjustments for the inside vents at each end of the dashboard
didn't work properly; the vents actually released more air when the
levers were in the closed position.
   But overall, the Sonata was a surprising car.
   Unfortunately, sales have been surprising, too _ surprisingly
low since the Sonata's introduction early in 1989. Hyundai had
looked to sell 80,000 of the cars this year. But sales totaled
26,150 through October as U.S. car sales turned sluggish.
   Because the Sonata is a new vehicle, there is no owner report of
trouble from Consumer Reports magazine.

<HEAD>The Artists: The Passion of Georgia O'Keeffe</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Passion and commitment to her art drove Georgia
O'Keeffe's painting, which both illuminates her appeal and adds a
compassionate dimension to the O'Keeffe legend, according to a
recent biographer.
   Roxana Robinson, author of ``Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life,'' said
the artist endures because she painted emotion in the 20th century.
   ``From the start of this century, painting in this country has
been done in the masculine tradition, (which) has been either cold
or angry. O'Keeffe's paintings are passionate, tender and full of
joy. And specifically they refer to the female experience,'' she
said in a recent interview.
   The findings by Robinson, aided in her study by cooperation from
O'Keeffe's family, come in contrast to popular notions that
O'Keeffe was detached, even cool about her work and relationships.
   She draws from O'Keeffe's letters and interviews with her
associates and relatives to trace the artist's life from childhood
on the Wisconsin prairie in the early 1900s through her tumultuous
marriage to New York photographer and art impresario Alfred
Stieglitz.
   ``Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life'' (Harper and Row, $25) also examines
O'Keeffe's complicated relationship with Juan Hamilton, a
23-year-old drifter who appeared on her doorstep looking for work
in 1973 and stayed until her death. The letters discount the
persistent sexual interpretations of O'Keeffe's work.
   ``She was much warmer and more vulnerable than I expected,''
said Robinson, a novelist and art historian. ``She was also
probably colder and more difficult, too. But doing the research I
began to understand why.''
   O'Keeffe's life on the prairie as the eldest daughter of a
farming family with six siblings taught her the importance of
self-sufficiency; her independence was established early in life.
   ``I am going to live a different life from the rest of you
girls,'' she said upon graduating from high school. ``I am going to
give up everything for my art.''
   Her love for Stieglitz, who was nearly two decades her senior,
was strong, and he not only was enamored with her, but as a leading
figure in New York's art world he was also her greatest booster.
   ``If you were a woman and a painter, you were a woman painter.
And that was very different from being a painter,'' Robinson said.
``It was important that she had somebody that was at least trying
to get her work perceived as equal to men. But he didn't promote
her work as any better than it actually was.''
   Stieglitz, however, was also O'Keeffe's greatest source of pain,
but she never confronted him with his appetite for other young
women. Again, her family ethic of self-sufficiency allowed her to
cope.
   She demanded her solitude to work and began to spend about half
the year apart from her husband, painting in New Mexico. The
O'Keeffe legend portrays her as a woman who just decided she was
leaving one morning, but O'Keeffe's pain was deep.
   ``At that period of her deepest grief and unhappiness she turned
her energies toward her art instead of her anguish,'' Robinson
said. ``If Stieglitz chose to make her unhappy, her job was to see
that she was not unhappy. It was not to change his behavior.''
   O'Keeffe died in 1986 at the age of 98.
   The research alone makes Robinson's book worth reading, although
her prose is sometimes redundant and her own pronouncements on
feminism often blunt the message O'Keeffe's life so clearly
illustrated.
   The book does not raise the issue of O'Keeffe's supposed
bisexuality because, Robinson said, she could not produce any
corroborating evidence.
   The sexual content of much of O'Keeffe's bright and flowing
flowers has long been debated, most vehemently by the artist
herself.
   ``When you took time to really notice my flower, you hung all
your own associations with flowers on my flower,'' O'Keeffe wrote
to one critic. ``And you write about my flower as if I think and
see what you think and see of the flower _ and I don't.''
   For O'Keeffe, the flowers were demonstrations of passion, but
not specifically representing genitalia or sexual objects, Robinson
says.
   ``O'Keeffe's flowers were images drawn from a female
perspective, which made them both new and suspect,'' Robinson wrote.
   Similarly, O'Keeffe's later stark depictions of cattle skulls
and bones she found on the desert of New Mexico were often
misinterpreted to symbolize death.
   ``I have wanted to paint the desert and I haven't known how,''
she wrote in an exhibition catalog. ``So I brought home the
bleached bones as my symbols of the desert. To me they are as
beautiful as anything I know. ... The bones seem to cut sharply to
the center of something that is keenly alive in the desert even
tho' it is vast and empty and untouchable _ and knows no kindness
with all its beauty.''
   Robinson portays O'Keeffe as a leading example of the changing
roles of women throughout the 20th century.
   ``Georgia O'Keeffe, by her example, gave permission to the
following generations of women to give work priority in their
lives, to consider it crucial,'' Robinson writes.
   ``Her paintings ... were about something that had never been
before so clearly revealed: the female experience.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Burning Down the House With a New Latin Beat</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forsaking African rhythms, jazz arrangements
and avant-garde electronics of previous Talking Heads and solo
efforts, David Byrne's latest musical safari has brought him to the
seductive beats of Latin America.
   ``It's a little different, maybe,'' Byrne said from the stage of
the Pantages theater to the bobbing concertgoers below. ``But maybe
not,'' he quickly added, springing into another conga-laced tune.
   Those familiar with the hybrid tastes of Byrne, the lead singer
of Talking Heads, knew just what he meant. Although his new album,
``Rei Momo,'' is infused with merengues and sambas, it's about as
traditional a record as any he's made.
   ``I'm not trying to convert people, or educate people or do any
of that kind of stuff,'' Byrne said in an interview while stopping
in Los Angeles during a national tour this fall. ``For me, it's
purely something I'm getting a lot of enjoyment out of _ music that
I think is deep and fun. It's what I want to do. It's not as though
I'm saying: `Now, I want to tell you about this! You must sit down
and listen!'''
   Unlike the contemplative, occasionally downcast themes cascading
through Byrne's prior work, ``Rei Momo'' carries both invigorating
lyrics and beats. In ``Don't Want to Be Part of Your World,'' for
example, he sings of children escaping an imperfect life to a place
``free from greed and hunger, free from hate and war.''
   ``I think it is somewhat inherent in the culture _ the music,
the melodies and rhythms _ that it can give you a kind of tinge of
something uplifting, spiritual or whatever,'' the 37-year-old Byrne
said.
   ``In Brazil, there's a vast difference between the rich and the
poor. The economy is in pretty bad shape. And yet they have these
incredible cultural resources. The spirit of the people is very
rich.
   ``Not only in Brazil but also in a lot of Latin culture, in the
barrios in New York and Los Angeles and Texas ... music is filled
with the spirit of life. And you feel, `This is what is allowing
people to go on.'
   ``The music seems to reflect their lives and add something to
their lives, rather than being the latest record that's foisted on
them.''
   Byrne is the latest American artist to use Latin sounds in pop
music in the 1980s. Others have included Paul Simon, who has worked
with Brazilian star Milton Nascimento, Quincy Jones and the
Manhattan Transfer. Madonna recorded a song, ``La Isla Bonita,''
which had a Latin flavor, and Linda Ronstadt put out an album of
Mexican favorites taught to her by her father.
   Twenty-five years after Brazilian music first caught American
ears with the quiet strains of bossa nova, a second Brazilian
invasion is occurring. Brazilian superstars such as Djavan, Simone,
Caetano Veloso and Nascimento have been signed to American labels
and are touring the United States.
   Latin music has likewise grown in popularity, with the arrival
of crossover artists such as Miami Sound Machine and Reuben Blades.
   The co-founder of the 14-year-old but now idle Talking Heads,
Byrne has directed the film ``True Stories,'' acted in public
television's ``Trying Times,'' and composed the scores for the
Twyla Tharp dance ``The Catherine Wheel,'' Robert Wilson's opera
``The Forest'' and the movies ``The Last Emperor'' and ``Married to
the Mob.''
   For the 1986 movie ``Something Wild,'' he composed his first
Afro-Latin single, ``Loco de Amor,'' sung by Celia Cruz, the queen
of Latin music.
   It was scarcely a radical departure. In some of the 10 albums
Byrne has recorded with Talking Heads, especially 1980's ``Remain
in Light'' and last year's ``Naked,'' his music has been laced with
African sounds.
   Byrne refined his appreciation for Afro-Latin compositions while
spending six weeks in Brazil last year making a documentary about
native dance-music rituals for public television's ``Alive From Off
Center.'' In addition to ``Rei Momo,'' he has assembled two
compilations of Brazilian hits, ``Beleza Tropical: Brazil Classics,
Volume 1,'' which reached the No. 1 position on Cashbox's Latin
charts, and the new ``O Samba: Brazil Classics, Volume 2.''
   Because Byrne enjoys a loyal following, his current tour is
attracting mostly capacity audiences. ``Rei Momo'' debuted at No.
30 on the compact disc charts while the album was No. 109 after two
weeks.
   Yet the people attending the concerts given by Byrne and his
16-piece band are largely white Americans _ not the kind of
audience usually seen at a concert where vocals aren't always in
English and the bandstand is filled with such instruments as the
coro and sencerro _ Cuban drums _ and guiro, a percussion device.
   ``What we're doing will help the Latin scene ... a lot,'' said
Milton Cardona, a percussionist who appears on Byrne's album and
tour.
   Angel Fernandez, who plays trumpet and arranged several of the
album's songs, said: ``That's part of the excitement. To us, it's
great to be bringing this music to a bigger audience. And I think
the public is ready for something new.''
   Said Byrne: ``You don't have to understand it to enjoy it.
   ``I'm encouraged by the audience (but) I'm still afraid about
radio,'' he said. ``When (radio stations) hear that it's a Latin
record, they say, `Whoa! We don't play Latin music, we play the
hits.'''
   For both the album and the 20-city tour that started in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in mid-September with plans for a South
American and Europe swing, Byrne gathered some of the nation's
leading Latin musicians _ veterans of bands for Ruben Blades, Tito
Puente and Cruz.
   In assembling the record, Byrne attempted to build songs that
satisfied both his perfectionist personality and the music's latent
disregard for formality.
   ``On the cumbia (`Independence Day'), for instance, I had a drum
set up for the recording session,'' Byrne said. ``And the drummer
came in, and he hardly ever touched the drums. He usually would
play the side of one of the tom toms. He didn't hit the snare drum
once. So it was ... everything exactly the opposite of what a rock
drummer would do.
   ``This was really different than recording with Talking Heads.
For each song, we'd kind of cast the players in a way. ... If
something was, say, a merengue, there are musicians who specialize
in that kind of rhythm and those kind of bass parts, and we'd get
those musicians in.''
   While a few critics have accused the shy musician of
international cultural vandalism, Byrne says he's only creating new
music out of old, as has been done for years.
   ``If everybody plays the same stuff, then nobody will listen to
any of it,'' he said.
   ``I want to be free to do whatever I want to do. ... I get
accused a little bit of flirting around with different styles, but
I think a lot of them have an awful lot in common, and that I'm not
jumping around as much as it may appear on the surface.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Caught in Time With Lucy and Ricky</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: National Book Award winners to be announced Nov. 29.</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>

   It's been months since Oscar Hijuelos has looked
at his novel, ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' a nominee for
the National Book Award.
   He remembers love scenes and music, but certain passages have
slipped his mind; picking up the book again will be like reading it
for the first time.
   It always works that way. Faces of old friends become blurred
over the years. Listen to your favorite song 100 times and a note
or turn of phrase will still surprise you. Only the most fanatical
Lucy fan can anticipate every joke.
   Memory, music, ``I Love Lucy'' _ they all matter in ``The Mambo
Kings Plays Songs of Love'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $18.95), in
which Desi Arnaz briefly drops in on the world of brothers Cesar
and Nestor Castillo, and to their astonishment, transports them to
the living room of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo.
   ``Arnaz was always one of the essential, successful Cubans,''
said Hijuelos, the son of Cuban immigrants. ``He didn't have a down
image. When you think about how Latins are portrayed in the media,
even today, they're either hoods or they're cops.
   ``He was a middle-class man, very successful. He had a
whacked-out life, but he had a real relationship, a real life, and
that image really enchanted me. He also a slight melancholic
streak. He had a lot of qualities that I related to.''
   Try to remember this ``I Love Lucy'' episode: Two Cuban
brothers, old friends of Ricky's, arrive at the apartment one day.
They exchange chitchat with the Ricardos, and later appear at the
Tropicana, crooning ``Beautiful Maria of My Soul'' with the
bandleader himself joining the brothers on stage. (Lucy, naturally,
is upset because she wanted to appear in the show instead).
   Sound familiar? Well, it never really happened, but that's the
point. ``Mambo Kings'' is a song of invented memory, a mournful
melody of events distorted by nostalgia and loss.
   ``The one thing you don't lose is memory, and memory nags you,''
Hijuelos said. ``Look at Jewish writers who write about things that
have happened, internally things go around and around and around.
   ``If you're hung up on the past you can't move forward. Nestor
tries to get courage from the American notion of discarding the
past and move forward.''
   Loss of youth, love and country run through ``Mambo Kings.'' In
the late 1940s, Carlos _ gregarious and ambitious _ and Nestor _
moody and romantic _ arrive in New York as aspiring mambo
musicians. The end comes 30 years later, in a rundown hotel room
where Carlos drinks himself to death.
   Women inspire their songs and their songs inspire women. Love
affairs for Carlos are as intense, and short-lived, as the latest
dance craze. For Nestor, heartbreak is timeless, a haunting ballad
undiminished by repeated listenings.
   And memories of home are inescapable for both Castillos. No
amount of rum, women and song can replace their simple, easygoing
life in Cuba.
   ``I think most immigrants are basically homesick,'' Hijuelos
said. ``You can't imagine losing something like your country unless
you've really lost it. It's just a dream of something lost, which
you can never really retrieve.
   ``You meet Cubans in Miami who have made a million bucks, but
they will never have what they had before.''
   Hijuelos was born in 1951 and grew up on 118th Street on
Manhattan's Upper West Side, a neighborhood remembered in his first
novel, ``Our House in the Last World,'' published in 1985.
   He first wanted to be a musician, but was turned off by the rock
'n' roll drug scene and drifted into writing in his mid-20s.
Hijuelos nearly quit that as well, finding authors no more
appealing than rock stars.
   ``I went to a writers conference in 1978 and I found it the most
sexist, hierarchal, opinionated, prejudical place I've ever been on
Earth. If you don't write their way, you don't write. If you're a
woman and pretty, you get invited to parties, if not, forget it.''
   Meeting author Donald Barthelme, who died recently, provided
Hijuelos with a valued friend and mentor.
   ``He sort of took me under his wing and pointed me in the right
direction,'' Hijuelos recalled. ``He wasn't narrow-minded in his
view of literature and exposed me to a lot of writers. And even
though I was writing quite differently from him, he never held that
against me.''
   ``He was a really nice man and a top-notch editorial adviser.''
   Barthelme helped with ``Mambo Kings,'' and Arnaz and some
not-so-famous musicians provided inspiration. Hijuelos recalled
working in a downtown office where the elevator operator would come
up to his floor and sing. A Cuban musician who died in a London
hotel room made a lasting impression.
   And, of course, there were songs, hundreds of them. ``Mambo
Kings'' is like a greatest hits album, complete with Hijuelos'
favorite dance songs, boleros and ballads.
   Hijuelos urges readers to start where they wish, open at any
page, like dropping the needle in the middle of a record, or tuning
in ``I Love Lucy'' at intermission and quickly filling in the plot.
   ``Barthelme was like that. Instead of thinking of a chapter as a
chapter, you think of it as an atmosphere, a state of
consciousness,'' he said. ``I wrote this book where you can open it
up anywhere and get an idea of what's going on in the book.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Shirley Jones Records First Solo Album</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a show business career of more
than 30 years, including singing in movie classics such as
``Oklahoma!'' and ``The Music Man,'' Shirley Jones has released her
first solo album.
   The Diadem Music LP ``Silent Strength'' is a collection of
gospel songs.
   ``I grew up singing Christian music,'' Jones, 55, said in a
telephone interview from her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. ``I was
the youngest member of my church choir at age 6.
   ``It has been synonymous with my singing. It's beautiful music
and this (project) was a wonderful experience.
   ``I've never really done a solo album. I've done the movie
albums and did some things for Columbia with my husband, Jack, and
of course `The Partridge Family.'''
   In 1970-74, Jones was Shirley Partridge in the popular TV comedy
about a family that became successful in show business. She
portrayed a widowed suburban mother and David Cassidy, her real
life stepson, was Keith Partridge.
   ``I did 23 motion pictures and nobody knew me until `The
Partridge Family,''' she said. ``But that's TV. The power of TV is
the strongest power we have now. You become a friend to people.
You're really not larger than life, but part of their family.
   ``The show had a combination of things. It had music for the
time. We were a family in show business, an everyday family. Plus
we had good actors. David was a teen hero and little Danny Bonaduce
was a wonderful young comedian. The chemistry worked.''
   Her movie credits, besides ``Oklahoma!'' and ``The Music Man,''
include ``Carousel,'' ``Elmer Gantry'' (Academy Award for
supporting actress in 1961), ``April Love'' and ``Beyond the
Poseidon Adventure.'' Her most recent film was ``Tank'' with James
Garner three years ago.
   The Oscar, she said, changed her career. ``I was considered a
pretty young thing who could sing until then. After that, they said
that maybe this kid can act. It opened doors for me, no doubt.''
   She also has appeared in several TV movies, including ``The
Family Nobody Wanted,'' ``Winner Take All,'' ``The Orchard
Children,'' ``Last Cry for Help'' and ``Silent Night, Lonely
Night.'' Most dealt with topical issues such as gambling addiction,
unjust adoption procedures and teen suicide.
   ``Those kind of roles are wonderful to play,'' Miss Jones said.
   She recently taped a two-hour tribute show to composer Richard
Rodgers, to be broadcast on the Public Broadcasting Service next
March.
   Jones also sings frequently with symphony orchestras across the
country. One of her traditional songs is ``You'll Never Walk
Alone'' from ``Carousel.'' The song is also on her solo album.
   ``It conveys a message to audiences of all types, whether
Christian or Jewish or whatever,'' she said. ``Those words touch
people. I've been singing it even before `Carousel.' It's been part
of my repertoire for 30 years now. When I think of the words during
a distressing time, it helps me through.''
   Among other cuts on the album, ``The Music's Gotta Stop
Someday'' describes the emptiness of entertainment without content.
The title cut ``Silent Strength'' is about trusting one's savior.
   ``We spent five hours in my living room one Sunday afternoon
going through the music,'' Jones said. ``We pored through music and
talked about words and what was right for me. I wanted to do
beautiful ballads with beautiful lyrics and no rock 'n' roll
stuff.''
   She said she's at a point in her career where she accepts only
projects that intrigue her. ``I'm at a marvelous place in my life.
I'm not driven by my career, but I never have been really. I can
pick and choose. I'm able to do what I want to do which is sing,
basically.''

   Paramount Communications Inc., the entertainment
giant that made a failed bid for Time Inc. this past summer, said
it plans to take a $140 million pre-tax charge on its publishing
operations for its recently completed fourth fiscal quarter.
   Paramount said Tuesday that as a result its publishing
operations, which include Simon &amp; Schuster, Prentice Hall and
Pocket Books, will report a break-even performance for the year
ended Oct. 31.
   The charge reflects a writedown in the value of some publishing
assets and accruals for costs associated with improving publishing
technology.
   Despite the charge, the company's overall results are expected
to be sharply higher. It previously announced a $1.2 billion
after-tax gain on the sale of its consumer and commercial finance
business and a $12 million after-tax gain on the sale of two small
Prentice Hall units.
   Paramount earned $384.7 million, or $3.21 a share, on revenue of
$5.1 billion in fiscal 1988.
   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Paramount was
off $2.12{ a share at $54.
   ``The publishing side is not doing as well as I thought it would
be in the summer,'' said Andrew Wallach, who follows Paramount for
the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   But he said it is not unusual for a company to take charges when
it is also taking big one-time gains.
   Martin S. Davis, Paramount's chairman and chief executive, said,
``The charge against publishing earnings reflects changes in the
marketplace affecting the entire industry, such as sharply rising
product development and marketing costs and shorter revision
periods for textbooks.''
   He said the fundamentals of Paramount's publishing businesses
were ``extremely sound'' and should continue to represent an
important source of earnings and cash flow.
   ``We are confident that fiscal 1990 results will show
significant improvement and provide a solid base for growth in the
decade of the 1990s and beyond,'' he said.
   Paramount previously announced that it expects to take an $80
million charge for the costs of its failed bid for Time.
   Time rejected Paramount's $12 billion takeover offer, bought
controlling interest in Warner Communications Inc. and changed its
name to Time Warner Inc. Time Warner expects to buy the remaining
Warner shares later this year.
   Counting both the publishing charge and the charge related to
the failed buyout bid, Paramount said it expects little change in
its earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 1989 rcompared
with $147.8 million, or $1.23 a share, in fiscal 1988.

   Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell in
Tuesday's auction to the lowest level in nearly three years as the
government completed its quarterly refunding.
   The average yield was 7.87 percent, down from 8.14 percent at

   A total of $10 billion in bonds were sold out of bids totaling
$20.4 billion.
   In addition to Tuesday's bond auction, the refunding involved
sales of $10 billion of three-year notes last Thursday, $10 billion
of 36-day cash management bills last Friday and $10 billion of
10-year notes on Monday.

<HEAD>Grand Marnier Liqueur Plans Motorized Magazine Ad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The importers of Absolut vodka were nosed out
recently by Texas Instruments Inc. in getting the first ``talking''
magazine ad to market.
   But Carillon Importers Ltd. is back, claiming a first for
another of its brands _ a ``motorized'' magazine ad for Grand
Marnier liqueur.
   When the center spread of the four-page ad is opened, a
cardboard cutout that shows two fanciful birds with oranges on
their bodies gently swinging a bottle of Grand Marnier between them
as if it were a bell.
   The cutout is powered by a tiny battery embedded out of sight
beneath the cutout.
   The Teaneck, N.J.-based importer said Tuesday it had spent more
than $1 million on the four-page holiday ad that is to appear in
selected copies of the Dec. 11 issue of the New Yorker. The ad will
be included in the 200,000 issues of the magazine that are sent to
subscribers in California and New York state.
   The ad is the latest example of the extra effort some liquor
advertisiers take to make their ads stand out at Christmastime.
   Absolut vodka's talking ad in selected copies of the December
issue of Vanity Fair magazine delivered tinny holiday greetings in
Italian, English and Spanish.
   But Texas Instruments ran an ad with a talking computer chip
about two weeks earlier in Business Week magazine.
   Other holiday magazine ad spectaculars this year include a
hologram from Finlandia vodka, an ad with pull-up tabs from Chivas
Regal Scotch whisky and peel-off stickers from Crown Royal Canadian
whisky.
   Some advertising executives have criticized the ad spectaculars,
saying it detracts from the environment for their clients' ads. But
others argue the unusual ads attract attention to a magazine and
make consumers more aware of other magazines.
   ``Most people love to see this sort of thing in their
magazines,'' said Steven Florio, president and chief executive of
The New Yorker Magazine Inc. ``We thought this was innovative and
creative and our readers would enjoy seeing it.''

<TEXT>
   For years, few in the Northeast were
concerned about who owned the woods. Now preservationists worry the
verdant expanse may fall prey to developers catering to their
cramped clientele down south.
   With nearly 26 million acres of forest extending from Maine's
North Woods to New York's Adirondacks, there used to be little
worry that hunters, hikers, and fishermen would lose access to the
landscape renowned for its deer and bear habitat, sparkling lakes
and trout-filled streams.
   But conservationists now are suspicious about the huge
corporations trying to take over companies in the region and are
wondering what they plan to do with the land. Some fear they might
be seduced by the lucrative development of the isolated terrain
into vacation home tracts.
   ``People realized there was a change in the value of the
lands,'' said Ted Rankin of the U.S. Forest Service, one of the
authors of a congressionally mandated study on forest preservation.
   For decades, most forest land transfers involved swaps of
acreage from one paper company to another, with both companies
valuing the land largely on the basis of timber production, Rankin
said.
   Only recently came the realization that development potential
could far outstrip the value of the trees.
   Public awareness of that change came after corporate raider Sir
James Goldsmith bought Diamond International Corp. and liquidated
its assets, including 1.7 million acres of timberland, mostly in
the Northeast.
   One of the most spectacular parcels was the Nash Stream valley
in northern New Hampshire. Its sale last year to developers who
planned to subdivide it as vacation tracts goaded the state into
buying the 45,000 acres for $13 million, giving the developers a
tidy profit.
   Last month, Georgia-Pacific Corp. proposed a takeover of Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp., which owns 2.1 million acres of timberland
in Maine and is the state's largest landowner. The proposal renewed
conservationists' fears of a forest sellout that could spur
development and reduce public access.
   Assurances from Georgia-Pacific that it has historically been a
buyer, not a seller, of timberland failed to allay fears it might
be forced to sell much of the Great Northern acreage to ease its
takeover debt.
   ``While we may not have agreed with the way Great Northern has
cut its land and its forest practices, they have shown very little
interest in development and were pretty much dedicated to managing
the land for timber production,'' said Michael Cline, policy
director of Maine Audubon Society.
   ``With Georgia-Pacific, it's pretty much an unknown, and it's
difficult to say what's going to happen _ whether they'll sell out,
or decide to develop certain areas or continue in the mold of Great
Northern,'' Cline said.
   In the meantime, the outcry over Nash Stream prompted Congress
to spend $250,000 on the yearlong study of the region's forests to
assess ownership patterns, forest managment strategies and public
access.
   The purpose of the study was to develop ways to encourage
private owners to keep trees growing on their lands, rather than
cash in on its potential value for house lots and vacation retreats.
   The vast majority of the land is privately owned, most of it by
multinational pulp and paper companies that also operate the mills
which provide some of the region's best-paying jobs.
   Over the years, the companies have had few qualms about
permitting public recreational use of their lands, although
recently some have instituted gate fees to defray the costs of
maintaining large networks of private roads.
   To local residents, public access has long been regarded as a
birthright, part of the region's way of life.
   ``It's a strong feeling among the folks here in New England,''
said Richard Schneider, vice president for woodlands for Great
Northern Paper Co. in Millinocket. ``It's something that has
developed over many generations.''
   As the most heavily forested state other than Alaska, Maine
accounts for most of the territory encompassed in the congressional
Northern Forest Land Study. Also included are New York's
Adirondacks and Tug Hill region and small sections of northern New
Hampshire and Vermont.
   The report, released last month, offers alternative forest
preservation strategies, including tax incentives, conservation
easements, land-use planning and federal and state acquisition. A
series of public forums is being held across the region, and the
final report is scheduled to be presented to Congress in late March
or early April.

   As Wendy's International Inc. celebrates
its 20th anniversary today, its founder pledges to renew a
dedication to customers that he believes the fast-food chain lost
somewhere along the way.
   ``We forgot who the customer was,'' founder and former Chairman
R. David Thomas said in an interview this week. ``But in 1989,
we're working hard on customer satisfaction and clean restaurants.
   The high school dropout opened the first Wendy's in downtown
Columbus on Nov. 15, 1969, naming it after his daughter. He stuck
to a limited menu of hamburgers and chili that he believed was the
only way to maintain quality.
   Today, the chain has grown to the nation's third- or
fourth-largest, depending upon the criteria used, behind No. 1
McDonald's and No. 2 Burger King, and possibly behind Hardee's. It
rakes in $3 billion in annual sales with a menu that has mushroomed
to include pizza, salad, pasta, two types of chicken sandwiches,
burritos, baked potatoes and chocolate chip cookies.
   Thomas, who owns 8 percent, or $40 million, of Wendy's stock,
said in a 1978 interview that he wanted Wendy's to be bigger than
McDonald's Corp.
   Asked about that on Monday, he said: ``We still just want to be
the best, the cleanest restaurant, the best prices, the best food.
We'll be as big as we want to be.''
   Thomas, who retired as chairman in 1982, now stars in his own
folksy television ads for Wendy's, which is based in nearby Dublin.
   Industry analysts say Wendy's started on the fast track and grew
quickly, establishing 1,000 stores in nine years and becoming the
No. 3 fast-food chain before its recent slide.
   ``They developed a unique niche targeting the adult fast-food
segment of the hamburger industry with a tightly-focused menu,''
said analyst Jeff Stein of McDonald &amp; Co. in Cleveland.
   ``But Wendy's seems to have lost some of its focus as it tried
to expand its menu and diversify into breakfast, which was not
successful, and spent a lot of money upgrading its restaurants,''
he said. ``They've seen their market share erode along the way.''
   Thomas said the diversification was necessary.
   ``In 1979, we had a real problem with beef, and the price went
way up, and the word `nutrition' started appearing, so we put in
the salad bar. Competition was getting keener, so we added a lot of
things. I don't think we could have the same menu as we did in '69
and be successful,'' he said.
   Average sales at Wendy's 3,762 restaurants rose 2.4 percent to
$759,000 per store last year, breaking a three-year decline.
Hardee's Food Systems Inc. reported average sales of $920,000 at
its 3,200 stores last year.
   Per-unit sales at Wendy's were highest in 1984, at $871,000.
That was the year of Clara Peller's commanding performance in the
``Where's the Beef?'' commercials.
   ``Advertising is an important part of the business, but it's not
a cure-all,'' said analyst Howard Hansen of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
in New York.
   ``It may raise levels of awareness and bring customers in. But
unless you're giving a hot hamburger to a customer in a clean place
and quickly, all the advertising in the world isn't going to amount
to a hill of beans,'' he said.
   Hansen pegged Wendy's share of the fast-food market at about 4.8
percent, trailing 5.5 percent for Hardee's. McDonald's has about
18.9 percent, Hansen said.
   To help boost sales, Wendy's last November started installing a
system allowing customers to pay for food with a Visa card. Tests
show people spend more when they use credit cards, the company said.
   Earnings for the third quarter totaled $8.7 million, or 9 cents
a share, on revenue of $296.2 million, compared with the same
profit on revenue of $275.2 million for the same period last year.
   Thomas said that, for now, the company will continue a strategy
of making existing stores more profitable and opening new units at
a slower pace _ about 100 a year.
   ``We've got to take business from competition, business from
anyone,'' Thomas said. ``We've got to take care of the customers,
just like we did 20 years ago.''

<HEAD>Southland Says It Could Miss Debt Payments, May Restructure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disappointing sales and earnings growth is
threatening to put Southland Corp. in violation of its credit
agreements, forcing the parent of the 7-Eleven chain to consider a
restructuring less than two years after a $4.9 billion leveraged
buyout.
   The Dallas-based company said Tuesday that current projections
indicate it will not be able to meet its debt payment obligations
in 1991, despite better-than-industry-average increases in average
store sales.
   Financial analysts for months have been expressing concern that
Southland faced problems with its huge debt, although the company
until now maintained it could meet its obligations. But Southland
said sales projections at its 7-Eleven convenience store chain, the
nation's largest, had not been met.
   Although President Jere Thompson said Southland would meet its
$225 million principal payment due next month, ``given the
convenience retailing environment, Southland believes its working
capital may not be sufficient in 1991 to meet its principal and
interest obligations and other requirements of the business.''
   ``We are absolutely committed to improving our operating
results,'' said Thompson, a member of the founding family that
bought the company to avoid corporate raider Sam Belzberg.
   ``In addition, we feel it is only prudent to consider financial
restructuring alternatives well in advance of the time this cash
shortfall could occur.''
   He said one alternative might be a comprehensive
recapitalization. In a recapitalization, a company alters its
levels of debt and equity.
   The company has been selling assets since the leveraged buyout
to help pay off its debt, and announced Tuesday an agreement to
sell its 58 Hawaiian stores to Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd. for $75
million cash. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.
   Last week, Southland said it agreed to sell its remaining 50
percent interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp. to Venezuela's
state-owned oil company for $675 million. The sale should be
completed by the end of January, the company said.
   Proceeds from both transactions will be used to reduce the LBO
debt, the company said.
   Thompson said the company also continues to explore selling
other assets, including its five distribution centers and six food
processing centers.
   ``The last public projections we had were October 1988, and the
operating numbers that we were projecting have not materialized,''
said company spokeswoman Markeeta McNatt. ``Our sales and margins
are still extremely good, but they have not met our own
projections.''
   The company projected inflation-adjusted sales growth of 2
percent. However Ms. McNatt said, inflation had been higher than
anticipated and real growth amounted to only less than 1 percent
during the first nine months of this year.
   ``The summer was disappointing for the entire convenience store
industry. It was a cold, wet summer for most of the country,
especially our major markets,'' Ms. McNatt said.
   Despite the softness and competition from convenience stores
operated by oil companies, Ms. McNatt said Southland's average
store sales are continuing at 1988's strong levels, when they
increased 4.6 percent, compared with an industry average of a 2.1
percent decline.
   Also Tuesday, Southland reported a third-quarter loss of $63.37
million, compared with $46.8 million in the same quarter last year.
Revenue rose to $2.23 billion from $2.18 billion.
   For the first nine months of this year, it lost $243.76 million,
compared with a loss of $179.2 million in the year-earlier period.
The loss this year included a $56 million charge from exchange of
debt. Nine-month revenue rose to $6.29 billion from $6.02 billion.

   The sales slump in domestically made cars and
light trucks continued in early November, prompting speculation
that automakers will bring back incentives to attract buyers.
   ``The hard thing to read is which of the Big Three is going to
move quickly next to reinvigorate sales with new incentive
programs,'' analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
said Tuesday after sales figures were released.
   The eight major automakers with U.S. plants said they sold cars
and light trucks at an average daily rate of 26,194 during the Nov.
1-10 period compared with a 32,833-a-day pace during the same time
last year.
   Car sales dropped 23.1 percent, while sales of light trucks fell
15.3 percent during the period, compared with early November last
year. In October, domestic car and truck sales tumbled 11.6 percent
from the rate of October 1988.
   The drop in U.S. car and truck sales last month pushed down
October retail sales by 1 percent, the first decline in eight
months.
   ``We are in the midst of an automotive recession,'' said analyst
Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York. ``For anybody in
this economy, these types of numbers today are not funny.
   ``It's scary,'' he said. ``I don't think they are going to
continue. I hope they won't continue.''
   One of the ways automakers have accelerated auto sales recently
is through cash rebates or cut-rate financing. The companies had
incentive programs on a wide variety of 1989 models but have less
extensive programs now.
   Merlis and Phillippi said that could change.
   ``Any one of them (the Big Three) has a good reason to increase
them,'' Phillippi said. Merlis said he expected bigger incentive
packages to be combined with production cuts, a move analysts have
been expecting for months.
   ``You need more than just incentives to get inventories in
line,'' he said. ``This is an old-fashioned cyclical downturn with
a very sad effect on the general economy.''
   Sluggish car and light-truck sales during October and early
November have pushed the year-to-date sales rate down 2.6 percent
compared with the same time last year. Car sales are down 3.6
percent and truck sales are off 0.8 percent.
   General Motors Corp. said its early November combined domestic
car and truck sales were down 26.3 percent compared with last year,
with car sales dropping 29.1 percent and truck sales falling 20.9
percent.
   Sales of vehicles made in North America by Ford Motor Co. were
off 19.9 percent in early November, as car sales fell 23.5 percent
and truck sales dropped 14.3 percent.
   At Chrysler Corp., car sales during the period were down 22.5
percent and truck sales were down 9.9 percent, combining for a 16.6
percent drop in the early November vehicle sales pace.

<HEAD>Stock Market Reform Bill Clears First Hurdle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill giving the Securities and Exchange
Commission limited authority to control program trading in market
emergencies has cleared its first hurdle.
   The House telecommunications and finance subcommittee, after a
sometimes heated debate over whether it was too much too soon,
voted Tuesday to send the bill to the full Energy and Commerce
Committee for consideration, possibly as soon as Thursday.
   Congressional leaders have said they want to end the current
session before Thanksgiving.
   ``I'm not convinced it's something we should have such a rush to
judgment,'' said Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa. ``We all know we're not
going to get this through Congress and down to the White House
before the end of the year anyway,'' he added.
   But Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said ``I think it would be
unconscionable to leave this congressional session without sending
a message to the markets.''
   The bill, known as the Securities Markets Stabilization Act of
1989, would give the Securities and Exchange Commission new
authority to suspend or constrain practices that could cause market
volatility _ sharp price rises and drops.
   Chief among those controversial practices is program trading,
the almost instantaneous, computer-driven transactions involving
huge blocks of stock.
   The proposed legislation also:
   _Would give the SEC authority, after consulting with the
president, to halt all trading in the securities markets in the
event of an emergency like the 1987 stock market crash.
   _Require large securities transactions to be reported.
   _Require the parent and affiliated companies of securities and
investment firms to verify their financial stability with the SEC.
   Another provision that calls for coordinated clearing and
settlement of transactions among the SEC and other government
agencies was moved into a separate bill, the Coordinated Clearance
and Settlement Act, which also passed the subcommittee.
   A similar bill is pending in the Senate but Senate leaders have
expressed doubts that they can add a program trading provision and
still get it passed before the holiday break.
   The provision giving the SEC modified authority to halt program
trading was approved only after the panel agreed to an amendment by
Rep. Matthew Rinaldo of New Jersey, the subcommittee's ranking
Republican, limiting the description of practices the SEC could
halt or prohibit.
   ``This language does not ban program trading and it does not
direct the SEC to ban program trading,'' said Rinaldo. ``It allows
the SEC to use its discretion in limiting or curtailing disruptive
trading strategies.''
   Opponents of program trading are particularly critical of one
form, index arbitrage, in which speculators try to take advantage
of inconsistencies between the stock and futures markets by
simultaneously buying in one while selling in the other.
   Critics claim index arbitrage leads to wild price swings which
drives small investors out of the market. And that makes it harder
for U.S. companies to raise capital through the sale of securities,
they claim.
   Originally, the bill sought to prohibit ``manipulative, abusive
or disruptive practices'' but several panel members complained that
language was too vague.
   When Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman,
offered his assurance that he would hammer out suitable compromise
language before the bill went to the full committee, Rep. W.J.
Tauzin, D-La., said, ``What I don't think what we ought to do is
move on language we can't agree upon.''
   Other members complained that they needed more time to review
the most recent changes in the bill, some of which were added just
the night before.
   ``In the waning days of the session,'' said Rep. Thomas Manton,
D-N.Y., ``I think we're moving rather fast.''
   That sparked an outburst from Markey: ``We have had hearing
after hearing after hearing,'' he said, noting that several big
Wall Street securities firms that oppose program trading were
repeatedly invited to testify at those hearings but ``they turned
us down every time.''
   Rinaldo's amendment deleted the word ``disruptive'' from the
bill, which seemed to satisfy opponents pending further
negotiations on appropriate language.

<HEAD>Senate Extends Tax Breaks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has voted to extend through June 30
a dozen targeted tax breaks that are expiring, including
employer-financed education assistance.
   The extensions, most of them for six months, were approved by
voice vote Tuesday without debate and added to a bill authorizing
aid to Poland and Hungary. That measure is subject to further
consideration by the House.
   Each of the extensions had been approved by the House as part of
other legislation.
   Among the extended provisions are those offering tax reductions
for up to $5,250 per year of employer-paid education aid received
by a worker; a limited amount of employer-financed group legal aid;
businesses that increase spending for research and experimentation;
investment in rental housing for low-income families; self-employed
people to help cover the cost of health insurance; employers who
hire low-income people, and investors in bonds targeted to help
lower-income families buy a first home.
   Most of the tax breaks are due to expire Dec. 31. The deduction
for employer-financed education assistance expired last Dec. 31.
   The amendment adding the provisions to the Poland-Hungary bill
was written by Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo.
   ``If we allow them to expire, real damage can be caused,''
Danforth said. He cited, for example, the low-income housing credit
as about the only federal aid now available for that sector. ``If
we decide it is just going to go away for however long it takes
until we can re-enact it, there can be some real damage to
low-income housing,'' he said.
   The cost of the extensions, an estimated $1.2 billion, would be
made up by accelerating the rate at which large corporations must
turn over to the government the taxes they withhold from workers'
paychecks.

   Thousands of mostly elderly victims lost their
savings through Lincoln Savings and Loan after federal thrift
regulators undercut a Securities and Exchange Commission case
against its owner, say witnesses before a House committee.
   Four of the victims, some in tears, told the House Banking
Committee on Tuesday how Lincoln officials led them to believe junk
bonds in the thrift's holding company, American Continental Corp.,
purchased with their converted savings were federally insured and
safe.
   All of them blamed American Continental's chairman, Charles H.
Keating Jr., and five senators they tagged the ``Keating Five'' who
accepted a total of $1.3 million in political contributions from
the Phoenix millionaire.
   ``Up against the likes of Charles Keating and the influence he
was able to buy from elected officials and others in high office,
we didn't stand a chance,'' said Shirley Lampel, a partially blind
widow from Tustin, Calif., who lost $30,000.
   The five senators _ Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald Riegle,
D-Mich.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz., and John
Glenn, D-Ohio _ are subjects of inquiries by the Senate Ethics
Committee and the FBI.
   Officials are investigating whether the senators improperly
intervened on behalf of Keating in April 1987 with thrift
regulators who were considering seizing Lincoln on grounds it was
unsound. Despite a formal recommendation a month later recommending
just that, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board waited until April 1989
to seize Lincoln.
   All of the senators have denied any wrongdoing in the Lincoln
fiasco, which is expected to cost taxpayers up to $2.5 billion and
22,000 bondholders like Mrs. Lampel, a majority of them retirees,
another $250 million.
   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, who as a White House aide to
President Bush designed the $200 billion-plus taxpayer bailout of
the S&amp;L industry, said the experiences of Mrs. Lampel and others
has convinced him the banking laws need to be rewritten again.
   ``To be allowed to sell junk bonds of your parent (company) in
the lobby of a financial institution with the sinecure of federal
protection is something that Congress perhaps ought to prohibit,''
Breeden said. ``It's a little bit like having the requirement you
can't sell liquor within so many yards of a polling place.''
   While Mrs. Lampel and the others were being encouraged by
Lincoln officials to move their money out of federally insured
deposits into the high-risk, uninsured bonds, the SEC was trying to
determine if the holding company had filed false financial
statements.
   Breeden said a May 20, 1988, ``memorandum of understanding''
between the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and Lincoln accepting the
thrift's accounting on $135 million in disputed transactions gave
the parent company a powerful legal tool to resist the SEC's probe.
   ``The regulator of the subsidiary institution said, in essence,
that financial statements were all right,'' he said.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, now called the
Office of Thrift Supervision, said the memorandum ``in no way could
have impeded'' the SEC investigation. ``They're independent. ...
There's nothing we can do to get in the way,'' he said.
   Breeden also said the SEC has turned over some of the evidence
in its probe to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles considering
possible criminal charges against Keating and his associates.
   Keating and M. Danny Wall, the bank board's chairman and now
head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, have been subpoenaed to
testify before the House committee next week.
   While the committee has focused on Wall, the victims directed
much of their anger at Cranston, who raised more than $970 million
from Keating for his own and other Democratic political causes.
   Connie Wickman, 78, of West Hills., Calif., said she and her
husband were heartbroken when they learned their $25,000 in
retirement funds had been lost.
   ``I had no idea this man could be so corrupted,'' said Mrs.
Lampel. ``What Alan Cranston did here was not only foolish; it was
cruel, it was dishonest. It has devastated people and it has
devastated me.''
   Murray Flander, a spokesman for Cranston, said the senator has
``nothing but compassion for these people.''
   Among other Lincoln developments Tuesday:
   _The House committee's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, said he intends to investigate other failed thrifts
``beyond Lincoln,'' including Silverado Savings in Colorado, on
whose board Neal Bush, the president's son, once served.
   _Riegle, the Senate Banking Committee's chairman, acknowledged
through a spokeswoman that in March 1987 he visited a lavish resort
Keating was building in Arizona with Lincoln funds to give a speech
to American Continental employees.
   _Breeden said former SEC Commissioner Barbara Thomas, an
appointee of former President Carter, had called the agency's top
enforcement official as a character witness for Keating.
   A former top Bank Board official testified last week that Ms.
Thomas had approached her about obtaining for Keating an early
examination audit of Lincoln by regional thrift regulators.
Documents obtained by the House panel show that Ms. Thomas, as of
early this year, had an outstanding unsecured loan of $250,000 from
Lincoln.

   Every time the National Football
League's stars butt heads on network television, Julie Nimmons
says, her company is being thrown for a loss.
   She is president of Schutt Athletic Sales Co., which had
supplied 40 percent of the helmets used by NFL players until this
year, when the NFL's licensing arm signed an agreement with her
prime competitor, Chicago-based Riddell Inc.
   In an agreement with the NFL, Riddell is making helmets,
shoulder pads and other gear available to the league's 28 teams for
free if 90 percent of a team's players use its helmets. Players who
wear helmets by other companies must conceal those companies' logos.
   That agreement has landed the two companies in the Chicago
courtroom of U.S. District Judge James Zagel, where lawyers for
Schutt argued at a trial in September that Riddell has violated
federal antitrust laws. A decision is pending.
   ``Other people want to emulate their heroes,'' Mrs. Nimmons
said. ``They will use what their heroes use.''
   She said her central Illinois-based company could be forced out
of business by the agreement, which she says hurts its sales of
helmets to college and high school football teams.
   But David Kagan, an attorney for Riddell, said football helmets
aren't ``impulse'' items that coaches or equipment managers would
buy after glimpsing the helmets during televised NFL games.
   ``No one has ever tried to advertise football helmets on TV like
you would dishwashing detergent or bubble gum, because no one is
interested in that sort of thing,'' Kagan said. ``You would no more
advertise a football helmet than you would a B-1 bomber.''
   No money is involved in the Riddell-NFL deal. Riddell is gaining
exposure that might help the company launch a line of running shoes
and sportswear, Kagan said.
   Mrs. Nimmons contends that exposure is worth $750,000 a game or
$12 million a season _ the amount her company would have to pay for
television advertising during NFL games to match Riddell's air time.
   That is more than her company's annual gross receipts from
helmet sales, she said.
   Schutt, the nation's second-largest manufacturer of football
helmets, is privately held and Mrs. Nimmons declined to provide an
exact sales figure.
   Fortune magazine estimated Riddell's annual sales at $20 million
for 1988. Riddell officials did not return repeated phone calls.
   Frank Vuono, vice president of NFL Properties, which handles the
league's licensing rights, said the NFL hooked up with Riddell
because the company has been a licensee of NFL Properties for
years. A licensee has the right to market helmets with clubs' names
on them.
   ``Riddell has always provided good service to the clubs, and
it's not much of a change in the status quo,'' he said.
   In the last 10 years, the number of major football helmet
companies has dropped from 18 to three because of lawsuits over
helmet safety, Mrs. Nimmons said. The other major manufacturer is
BSN Corp.
   That trend has helped drive helmet prices higher, said John
Horan, editor of Sporting Goods Management News.
   ``A coach is probably paying $120 for a helmet that, taking away
the insurance and given a competitive situation, would probably
cost a fraction of that,'' Horan said.
   Deals like Riddell's will only push the price higher, Mrs.
Nimmons said.
   ``The cost of providing all those free goods will be borne by
the consumer,'' she said. ``All of a sudden the poor guy is paying
for the rich guy to get free stuff.''

<HEAD>Great Northern Digs In To Battle Takeover Try by Georgia-Pacific</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. has stepped
up its defense against an unwanted takeover offer from
Georgia-Pacific Corp.
   ``We have no interest in anything but staying independent at
this stage,'' Great Northern Chairman William R. Laidig told a news
conference Tuesday, after meeting earlier for 45 minutes with state
Attorney General James E. Tierney.
   ``What we have asked him to do is look to our record and see how
we have handled our resources in Maine ... to weigh it in his
consideration about how he would proceed in court,'' Laidig said.
   Georgia-Pacific has offered $3.13 billion to take over Great
Northern, which owns 2.1 million acres of forest lands in Maine.
Part of the Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific's merger strategy
involves an attack on Maine's anti-takeover law.
   On Tuesday, Great Northern responded in U.S. District Court in
Portland to lawsuits by Georgia-Pacific challenging the
anti-takeover law and the company's by-laws containing so-called
``poison pill'' provisions to thwart hostile suitors.
   Great Northern, a major producer of pulp and paper, is
incorporated in Maine, although its headquarters are in Norwalk,
Conn.
   Tierney said Tuesday that he does not want to take sides in the
merger dispute, but rather hopes to ensure the best deal possible
for Maine's mill employees and the environment.
   ``I feel that the current management of this company is
committed to our state and making sure Maine will be an integral
part of their operations,'' Tierney said.
   Georgia-Pacific has also attempted to persuade Maine officials
that its buyout plans would be good for the state.
   In a letter to Gov. John R. McKernan, Georgia-Pacific Chairman
T. Marshall Hahn Jr. called the deal ``the old-fashioned kind of
transaction that benefits everyone,'' but he stopped short of
offering any guarantees about what Georgia-Pacific will do if it
wins the merger fight.
   Environmentalists have raised concerns that Georgia-Pacific
might try to sell off valuable recreation lands to developers to
pay for its acquisition.
   The governor's office on Tuesday released a copy of Hahn's
letter, which says, ``If special circumstance arise such that land
had to be sold for unforeseen reasons, I assure you that (the) Land
for Maine's Future Board would be given the right of first refusal
on such sales for two years.''
   In its court response Great Northern disputed allegations that
the anti-takeover provisions of its by-laws were designed to
entrench management at shareholder expense, saying it was ironic
that Georgia-Pacific itself has a shareholder rights plan and
supermajority voting rules similar to the ones it is challenging in
court.
   Great Northern also said Tuesday it had filed a petition with
the Interstate Commerce Commission challenging an exemption granted
last week to Georgia-Pacific Corp. so it could take over Great
Northern's railroads as part of a buyout attempt.
   ``They cut corners in an attempt to circumvent the commission's
jurisdiction,'' Great Northern spokesman Stephen M. Hill said in a
statement. ``This is simply another example of Georgia-Pacific's
use of questionable tactics to further their own ends.''
   Great Northern attorney Fritz Kahn of Washington said that
Georgia-Pacific got the ICC approval by eliminating _ on paper _ a
trucking franchise that could have blocked the railroad
acquisition, then getting its exemption a day later. The company
kept its trucking fleet and can still use the trucks for
transporting its own materials, Kahn said.
   Georgia-Pacific issued a statement defending the company's
tactics and said there was no merit to Great Northern's ICC filing.

<HEAD>Delta Announces Purchases of McDonnell Douglas, Boeing Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines will buy up to 260 new jets from
McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Boeing Co. in a transaction valued at
more than $10 billion, the carrier announced.
   The planned purchases of MD-90s and Boeing 737-300s over the
next 11 years is in addition to $13 billion in orders announced
previously. Delta now has 519 new jets on order as part of its
drive to expand service and replace older aircraft.
   Atlanta-based Delta ordered 50 Boeing 120-passenger 737-300 jets
and took options for 50 more. The first planes arrive in 1993.
   Delta ordered 50 of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s new 150-seat MD-90
jets and took options to buy 110 more. But 60 of those options were
originally placed last year for MD-88 aircraft and converted
Tuesday to MD-90 options, Delta said.
   Deliveries begin in 1994.
   A year ago Delta ordered $10 billion worth of mostly
international-range jets for expansion in Asia and Europe.
   In all, Delta now has 182 orders and 337 options for new jets
worth $23 billion.
   ``Delta is putting a lot of financial effort into keeping a
modern, efficient fleet as we continue to grow,'' Chairman Ronald
W. Allen said at a news conference Tuesday.
   Allen said Delta expects to expand capacity by 5 percent to 7
percent per year over the next decade.
   Delta has the youngest fleet of any major U.S. carrier, and
Allen said the airline hopes to maintain an average aircraft age of
about 8 years by retiring older DC-9s, Boeing 727s and 737s.
   ``This will give Delta the ability to go either into a heavy
fleet replacement program or, depending on the market, a heavy
growth plan,'' said Paul Karos of First Boston Corp.
   Allen said Delta expects to pay for the new planes primarily
with operating revenues. He said the airline, which earned a record
$460.9 million last fiscal year, is committed to keeping its debt
low.
   Allen said the purchases won't mean fare increases because a
modern fleet saves money in the long run. ``I don't think our fare
increases will exceed the consumer price index in coming years,''
he said.
   The MD-90s have a list price of $40 million each, while 737-300s
cost about $29 million each. Allen declined to say how much of a
discount Delta will get. He also wouldn't say how much of a down
payment Delta must make.
   The MD-90 is an updated version of McDonnell-Douglas's popular
MD-80 series jet. It is five feet longer than the MD-88, with eight
more seats, and has quieter, more fuel-efficient engines. Delta is
the first to order an MD-90.
   Allen said the 737-300s will have 120 seats _ eight fewer than
the 13 737-300s Delta already has. With fewer seats, there will be
more leg room and bigger galleys and closets.

<HEAD>With PM-Wendy's Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYA L. WESLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hank Aaron has returned to the city where he
hit most of his 755 home runs as a professional baseball player,
but this time he's traded his baseball garb for an entrepreneur's
attire.
   Aaron has opened three Arby's fast-food roast beef restaurants
in the Milwaukee area and is contracted to open 12 more by 1991.
Sales at his Arby's outlets are expected to reach $2 million this
year.
   Aaron, a member of the Professional Baseball Hall of Fame and
the major league's all-time career home run leader, attributes his
business success to favorable location, courteous service and
competent management.
   He said he chose to begin his business in Milwaukee because of
low property costs and his attachment to the city where he spent 12
years as a professional baseball player. Aaron played for the
Milwaukee Braves from 1954 to 1965 and for the Milwaukee Brewers in
1975 and 1976.
   ``No matter how many places I go, Milwaukee always seems to be a
part of me,'' Aaron said. ``The people have always been very kind
to me and I'll always remember that.''
   Repaying that kindness is one reason why Aaron tries to impress
upon his employees the importance of good service.
   ``The most important thing that I want all of us to understand
is that we are serving the public,'' he said. ``Whether customers
buy one Coke or 15 sandwiches, they're all going to be treated the
same way _ with a smile and a `thank you.'''
   Aaron visits Milwaukee about four times a year, but spends most
of his time in Atlanta where he is vice president of player
development for the Atlanta Braves.
   Fred Fiorito, who manages Aaron's Wisconsin operations, said a
strong economy in Milwaukee and good consumer response to Arby's
roast beef sandwiches account for much of the restaurants' success.
   ``There's just been a real good reception for Arby's in
Milwaukee and Wisconsin as a whole,'' Fiorito said.
   Arby's sells roast beef sandwiches and other hot specialty
sandwiches many consumers see as a welcome alternative to
hamburgers.
   Aaron said at a grand opening celebration for one of his three
locations that an elderly woman thanked him for bringing Arby's to
a community that had offered ``nothing but hamburger joints.''
   Aaron's stores have ``added a nice component'' to Arby's
Milwaukee operations, said Norma Stanley, Arby's manager of
corporate communications in Atlanta.
   Aaron is also spokesperson for the company's corporate charity,
the Big Brothers-Big Sisters program, and has helped to raise $5
million over the last four years, she said.

<DATELINE>TSUKUBA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading researchers into superconductivity
said Wednesday some progress was coming faster than expected but
many problems remain in a scientific field that may revolutionize
the use of electricity.
   About 700 scientists, including some 70 from the United States,
Europe and elsewhere outside Japan, are in Tsukuba, a university
town outside Tokyo, for three days of lectures, papers and
discussions on the latest research into superconductivity, which
has obsessed thousands of scientists since a breakthrough in 1986.
   ``I think the development goes faster than I thought,'' said K.
Alex Mueller, who won the Nobel Prize for the 1986 breakthrough at
IBM laboratories in Zurich, Switzerland.
   Superconductors are materials that carry electricity without any
loss of energy from resistance. The phenomenon was first seen at
extremely low temperatures, but since 1986 scientists have
developed a series of materials that work at somewhat higher
temperatures, raising the possibility that the phenomenon will
occur at temperatures that don't require baths of liquid nitrogen.
   Superconductivity could make the use of electricity much more
efficient, reducing the need to burn so much fossil fuel and
opening the way for magnetically levitated high-speed trains,
electric cars, better batteries, small supercomputers and many
other uses.
   Competition among scientists is intense, and cries of alarm have
been raised in the United States that Japan is investing more
heavily in research and thus may make key commercial breakthroughs.
   ``There are many of the same parallel activities going on in the
two countries,'' Arthur W. Sleight of Oregon State University, a
featured speaker in the symposium's first session, told a news
conference. ``The effort is somewhat better organized in Japan, but
there is progress in the United States.
   ``People have many of the same objectives and are ... working
toward those objectives.''
   Mueller said the European attitude is to remember that it took
20 years to develop a practical transistor. ``The important thing
is to have sustained effort,'' he said.

   An insurance company has reimbursed the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette $2 million of the largest libel judgment
ever paid by a newspaper, leaving the paper's publishing company to
absorb $270,000 of the judgment.
   ``I can tell you that it's a load off my back,'' Post-Gazette
Publisher William Block told the newspaper staff.
   The newspaper reported today that PG Publishing Co. received the
$2 million Tuesday from National Surety Corp., a subsidiary of
Firemen's Fund Insurance Cos. National Surety agreed to pay the
amount in a settlement approved Tuesday.
   PG Publishing had sued National Surety in May after the company
refused to pay the libel claim under the newspaper's
excess-liability policy. National Surety argued that state law
prohibits an insurer from paying punitive damages, which are
intended to punish and to serve as a deterrent.
   Richard DiSalle, a former judge, had sued the newspaper over a
1979 article about a disputed will he handled as a lawyer. The jury
awarded DiSalle $200,000 in actual damages and $2 million in
punitive damages. The award came to $2.77 million with the addition
of $561,000 in interest.
   The newspaper paid DiSalle in July after its primary insurer,
Mutual Insurance Co. Ltd. of Bermuda, agreed to pay the $1 million
limit of its coverage. Half that amount went to DiSalle and the
rest covered attorneys' fees.
   Even with insurance covering the bulk of the libel award, the
newspaper will suffer economically, Block said.
   A hiring freeze and other cost-saving measures implemented in
response to the award will remain in effect until at least the end
of the year, Business Manager Raymond Burnett said.
   ``We will look at 1990 as a year when we get back to full
staffing,'' Burnett said.
   The Post-Gazette said the judgment was the largest paid by a
newspaper and the second-largest libel judgment upheld by U.S.
courts. The largest was a $3 million award last year against CBS.
   The U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the DiSalle libel award
last June.
   National Surety attorney Robert Luddy said the settlement was
not an admission that the company's position on punitive damages
was incorrect.
   ``Some of these cases are better settled than litigated. This
happened to be one of them,'' he said. ``Our position hasn't
changed.''

<HEAD>House Chairman Calls for Greater Protections of Private Pension System</HEAD>

   The chairman of a House panel today called for
stronger measures to protect private pension fund assets so workers
do not lose their retirement savings to fraud and mismanagement.
   ``We must develop greater safeguards to adequately protect the
nation's private pension fund assets,'' Rep. Bill Hughes, D-N.J.,
said as he opened a hearing by the House subcommittee on retirement
income and employment.
   ``Our workers and retirees have a right to expect that the
pensions they have worked so hard to earn, and which they are
counting on to meet basic living expenses during their retirement
years, are not eroded away by waste, fraud and corruption,'' he
said.
   The hearing stemmed from reports issued by the Labor
Department's inspector general office, which pointed to the
vulnerability of $2 trillion in assets of pension plans covering 76
million Americans.
   The latest inspector general's report, obtained Tuesday by The
Associated Press, says billions of dollars in private pension money
is not being fully audited because the money was invested in such
instiutions as savings and loans.
   Some Labor Department officials dispute the extent of the
problems, saying the department's acting inspector general, Raymond
Maria, has exaggerated the potential for fraud. Maria has likened
the potential to the recent savings and loan crisis, which some
estimates say will require a $100 billion taxpayer bailout.
   David George Ball, assistant labor secretary for pension and
welfare benefits, told the hearing, ``The pension system, by any
objective measure, has never been healthier.''
   Maria, in his testimony, said ``our goal is not to unnecessarily
frighten people, but to stimulate concern where such concern is
needed, and to avoid potential future crisis.''
   He said inadequate regulations and reliance on civil rather than
criminal remedies have ``created a window of opportunity for those
who would embezzle and steal from plan participants.''
   Michael S. Gordon, a member of the Labor Department's pension
advisory council, said in an interview that ``not everything in the
private pension system is peaches and cream.'' But he added that
the inspector general's office has ``inspired unnecessary fear and
anxiety.''
   Either way, Hughes said, there is reason for concern. ``I heard
the same sectors saying the savings and loan situation wasn't
serious five years ago,'' he said. ``It seems to me we should have
learned from history.''
   Concern about the pension system has grown with discovery of a
number of multimillion-dollar skimming schemes and with financial
difficulties encountered by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp., which insures private pensions. The PBGC is $1.5 billion in
the red, and that deficit could balloon if the agency loses a
Supreme Court case involving LTV Corp.
   Hughes said the PBGC deficit ``suggests to me we might have a
more serious problem than the Department of Labor led us to
believe.''
   The hearing by the House Subcommittee on Retirement Income and
Employment was billed as a ``review of the U.S. Department of
Labor's efforts to prevent fraud and abuse.'' The subcommittee also
was to review the latest inspector general's report, which
recommends full audits on a wider array of private pension and
health programs.
   In an earlier study, Maria's office reported that $18.7 million
in misused plan assets and administrative violations were found in
plans examined in late 1987.
   But under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
known as ERISA, some plans are subject only to partial audits. The
plans must be reviewed annually by private accountants, but those
audits do not cover what happens to the money when it is invested
in institutions such as savings and loans.
   The assumption was that since S&amp;Ls are subject to their own
federal inspections, pension plan assets invested with them need
not be audited separately.
   But following the savings and loan crisis, the new report says
the current system provides inadequate protection to working
Ameicans whose retirement savings are invested in such plans.
   ``The well-publicized problems in the savings and loan segment
of the industry further illustrate the problems that can occur,''
the report says.
   The report examined 279 audits completed by private accountants.
It found that almost half were not subject to full review.
   ``The result was that in our audit universe, $4.2 billion out of
$9.8 billion in plan assets (43 percent) were never audited,'' the
report said. ``We believe that 43 percent of employee benefit plan
assets escaping audit scrutiny is unacceptable.''
   Maria's office is asking that Congress amend ERISA to require
private accountants to conduct full audits and report infractions
directly to the Labor Department. It also wants the department to
lean more heavily toward criminal rather than civil enforcement.

from Tuesday's setback.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.96 to 2,617.21 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 590 up, 386 down and

   The high-flying portable computer market will
soar to greater heights through the wizardry of notebook-sized
machines, tiny color screens and images that ``float,'' industry
experts predict.
   Not everyone goes so far as New York retailer James V. Cosby,
who flatly predicted Tuesday: ``They are going to replace
desktops.''
   But from one-pound ``palmtops'' to 20-pounders, there's no doubt
about the sales portables are racking up, or the attention they are
drawing at this year's Comdex convention, the world's biggest
computer show.
   The overall personal computer market is growing about 10 percent
a year. But sales of portables are expected to triple that growth
rate for the next three years, and sales of machines in the
8{-by-11-inch ``notebook'' format will more than quadruple,
predicted Tim Bajarin, executive vice president of Creative
Strategies International and a leading Silicon Valley consultant.
   About 300,000 portables were shipped in the United States in
1983, the first year true portables were available, he said at a
panel discussion.
   Bajarin expects shipments of 1.4 million this year and 2.5
million by 1992.
   Perhaps hottest of all at the show are Compaq Computer Corp.'s
six-pound, notebook-size LTE and LTE286 machines. They are the
first of their size to accept 3{-inch floppy disks which are now
standard for desktop computers.
   Compaq officials say their new models are more convenient than
other machines which use tiny memory cards or smaller disks _
although makers of other models contend the cards are tomorrow's
technology.
   Compaq officials say they have struggled to meet demand in the
month since they introduced the two machines. The LTE begins at
about $2,400. The LTE286, which runs on a faster 80286
microprocessor, lists for $3,900 to $5,000.
   Among the competing high-performance notebook-size computers are
the Toshiba T1000SE and NEC's Ultralite, a pioneer when it was
introduced a year ago. The Ultralite weighs just 4.4 pounds, has a
bigger screen than the LTE's, and costs about the same. Storage of
information is on memory cards.
   Also hot are the one-pound mini-machines known as palmtops or
breast pocket computers. Atari's Portfolio, which operates on two
AA batteries for 48 hours, fits in a jacket pocket and sells for
$400. Not intended to rival its bigger and more expensive cousins,
it has five simple built-in programs.
   At about $2,000, Poqet Computer Corp.'s palmtop offers a bigger
screen and keyboard, all within the tiny package.
   ``Our computer now uses about the same amount of power as a
single Christmas tree twinkle light,'' meaning it can run for 100
hours on two AA alkaline batteries, said Poquet's president, Stave
Prodromou.
   Near the other extreme is Dolch Computer Systems' ``portable''
that uses Intel's new 80486 microprocessor _ the hottest, most
powerful chip in the world for personal computers.
   The industrial-looking Dolch weighs nearly 20 pounds, but the
company says it can compete in performance with very high-end
desktop computers and work stations. Its price is hefty, too: about
$13,000 to $18,000.
   Also on display was a laptop called Gridpad. It uses a pen-like
device to ``write'' on a document-sized screen, allowing forms to
be filled out and even signed on a computer screen.
   Cyberspace's laptop does away with a screen in favor of headgear
that projects a hologram-like image that seems to hang in the air
in front of the user. It's pitched as a boon for the
security-conscious; no one can look over your shoulder and see what
you're writing or reading.

<HEAD>Southmark Approves Sale of Integon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southmark Corp. said it has reached an agreement
to sell its 89 percent stake in Integon Corp., its insurance unit,
for cash and securities to a new company formed by Jupiter
Industries Inc. and Head Insurance Investors L.P.
   Under terms of the sale, approved Tuesday by Southmark's board,
the two companies will pay $189 million in cash, debt and new stock
for Integon and repay or assume $120 million in Integon debt,
Southmark said.
   Jupiter, based in Chicago, and Head, based in New York, had
withdrawn an earlier offer of $135 million for Integon.
   Integon shareholders, including Southmark, will receive about
$94 million, or $3.04 a share. The remainder will be placed in
escrow against potential losses, Southmark said. The unused
escrowed funds eventually will be returned to shareholders, the
company said.
   Previous agreements to sell Integon called for shareholders to
receive as much as $7.45 a share, but those efforts fell through
for lack of financing or inability to reach a final accord.
   Southmark, the Dallas-based real estate and financial services
concern which is seeking to reorganize under the protection of
federal bankruptcy court, could receive up to $43 million in
much-needed cash for its 89 percent stake in the life insurance
company if the sale is approved.
   The sale must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas and
by Integon's board and its outside shareholders. Southmark said it
anticipates completing the transaction by April 30, 1990, and
either party can end the agreement if the sale isn't closed by then.
   Southmark reported a $109.2 million loss for its insurance group
for the third quarter ended March 30. The loss includes a $90
million expected deficit from the sale of the group and contributed
to the company's $1.04 billion third-quarter loss.
   Jupiter is controlled by Chicago real estate investor Jerry
Wexler, and Head, an investment partnership, is managed by New York
merchant banking firm John Head &amp; Partners.

   News Corp., Rupert Murdoch's
Australia-based international media company, reported Wednesday its
first quarter earnings dropped 78 percent, partly because of
revenue lost during a labor dispute.
   News Corp. said it earned $28.7 million, or 23 cents per
American depository receipt (ADR), in the three months ended Sept.
30, down from $133.1 million, or 83 cents per ADR, in the same
period a year earlier, when the company had a $61.2 million
after-tax gain from asset sales.
   Each ADR is equivalent to two News Corp. common shares. They are
traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
   News Corp. said its revenue rose to $1.51 billion from $1.27
billion a year earlier, but that its results were affected by a
14-week dispute by pilots that eroded earnings at Ansett Airlines,
which News Corp. jointly owns with TNT Ltd.
   It did not say what the dispute had cost in terms of lost
revenue.
   The company said its earnings also were affected by inclusion
from Sept. 1 of operating results for its Sky Television operations
in Britain, and an increase in interest payments.
   News Corp.'s U.S. holdings, which include the Twentieth Century
Fox film studio, the Fox television network and publications
including TV Guide and the Daily Racing Form, provided the bulk of
sales and earnings for the company.
   Murdoch had prepared shareholders for a lean profit year at the
company's annual meeting Oct. 10, warning then that annual earnings
may ``not have their customary increase.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade
following an Agriculture Department announcement of wheat sales to
Egypt and the Philippines.
   Although the sales were relatively small _ 50,000 metric tons
apiece at subsidized prices _ traders welcomed the news after
Tuesday's announcement that China had canceled purchases of 300,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat.
   Export sales of U.S. grain have been slack lately, and any news
of new demand is likely to prompt buying of grain futures.
   Corn was up slightly while soybeans were mixed, reflecting
strength in the soybean meal market and weakness in the soybean oil
market.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.02 a bushel; corn
was 1{ cents to 1} cents higher with December at $2.41{ a bushel;
oats were { cent to 1 cent higher with December at $1.45{ a bushel;
soybeans were \ cent lower to 1{ cents higher with November at

   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .17 cent higher with December at
74.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with November at 83.05 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent
lower to .50 cent higher with December at 48.57 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .35 cent lower to .80 cent higher with
February at 62.80 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Tuesday with pork

<HEAD>Exchange Probes Possible Manipulation of Stock-Options Exchange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board Options Exchange is
investigating the possibility that stock-index options were
manipulated as part of program-trading activity, a published report
says.
   The exchange is looking at trading in Standard &amp; Poor's 100
stock index options during the Oct. 13 stock market plunge as well
as other volatile trading days, the Wall Street Journal reported in
today's editions.
   The CBOE is the fourth exchange to search for program-trading
abuses. The New York Stock Exchange and two other Chicago exchanges
are conducting a separate probe of computer-assisted program
trading in stocks and stock-index futures.
   CBOE President Charles Henry told the Journal that the exchange
is looking at ``sources of volatility,'' including trades, programs
or otherwise, that may have involved manipulation or other forms of
rule-breaking.
   ``We are looking at all volatile days,'' Henry said. ``We have
been in touch with the SEC frequently about the events, and they
are well aware of the review that is being conducted.''
   Exchange officials did not immediately return telephone calls
seeking comment.
   For years, the CBOE has been a source of rumors and suspicions
about program-trading abuses, the Journal said. Those suspicions
partially result from the complexity of options-related
program-trading strategies that are only understood by the most
sophisticated traders.
   Additionally, traders say program trades in S&amp;P 100 stock index
options have moved the market in the past, the newspaper said.
   Program trading is the rapid buying and selling of stocks by
computer to take advantage of temporary price differences. A stock
option is the right to buy or sell the underlying value of a stock
index, such as the S&amp;P 100, at a specified price within a specified
time.
   The unique feature of stock-index options is that they are
settled by payment in cash, not with delivery or receipt or stocks.
Also, S&amp;P 100 options can be exercised at any time before their
expiration date.
   The SEC reported that the S&amp;P 100 options market re-emerged as a
popular program-trading vehicle after the 1987 crash.
   A June 30 SEC memo said ``S&amp;P 100 stock index options were often
the second-most heavily used derivative product for index arbitrage
from November 1988 to April 1989.''
   Program trades involving the S&amp;P 100 options accounted for 8
percent to 19 percent of total index arbitrage volume for the
six-month period, the commission said.

<HEAD>Year-End Trap in Mutual Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the end of the year approaches, financial
advisers are issuing warnings about a trap that can spring on
anybody who buys shares of mutual funds.
   If you are thinking about getting into a fund or making a
substantial addition to an existing fund holding before year-end,
they say, you should do a little extra research.
   The subject of that inquiry: Is the fund about to declare its
annual distributions of dividends and capital gains?
   If the answer is yes, the experts say, you might seriously
consider waiting to invest your money until after the record, or
ex-dividend, date for those distributions, and thus miss sticking
yourself with an unnecessary tax obligation.
   The trap works this way:
   To qualify for status as investment companies that don't
themselves have to pay taxes, most mutual funds must pass through
substantially all of their investment income to their shareholders
each year.
   These distributions then become taxable, as dividends or capital
gains, to the shareholders.
   The typical money-market fund or income fund investing in bonds
declares its dividends daily, or at least monthly. So it doesn't
matter much what time of year you choose to invest in these.
   By contrast, many stock funds or others that might earn capital
gains _ for example, a fund investing in high-yield ``junk'' bonds
that can fluctuate a great deal in price _ make all or a big chunk
of their distributions once a year.
   The effective date of the distribution is often set between
mid-December and the end of the year, for payment a few weeks later.
   If you buy fund shares just before the record date, you put
yourself in the position of having some of your capital returned
almost immediately to you, burdened with a tax liability, before it
has had a chance to earn you any real return.
   ``You have acquired a share of the other stockholders'
profits,'' says Sheldon Jacobs in his Handbook For No-Load Fund
Investors.
   Suppose, for illustration purposes, that a fund's net asset
value stands at $20 a share when you buy it just before the
ex-distribution date. Then a $2 distribution is declared, lowering
the net asset value to $18.
   Presumably, you don't want this ``income'' in cash _ you just
put the money into the fund. But even if you have it automatically
reinvested in new shares, you can't duck the tax liability.
   No such problem arises if you wait until after the record date.
Whatever amount you had set aside to invest will buy
proportionately more shares at $18 than it would have at $20.
   Stock funds' distributions tend to be especially sizable in bull
market years, such as 1989.
   Information about a fund's plans should be readily available
through a simple phone call to the fund before you decide to buy.
   Of course, if the investment is being made in an individual
retirement account or other program that shelters it from current
taxes, the timing of distributions doesn't matter.
   But among taxable investors, those who show up at the wrong time
are presented with a share of the bill for a party they didn't
attend.

   In the private and mysterious world of
high-powered jewelry dealing, Arthur Groom stands out like a
diamond in the rough.
   Groom, 39, whose firm sold $12 million worth of diamonds and
colored stones last year, frequently travels to jungles, cavernous
mines and other remote spots in Asia and Africa in a constant
search for the world's rarest rocks.
   Like the sailing merchants of centuries past, Groom will barter
and trade for many of his stones. He recently swapped a shipload of
cement for $1 million worth of diamond ``roughs'' from the African
nation of Sierra Leone.
   Groom seeks stones in dangerous, strife-ridden nations, such as
Burma, where he says he is only the third American since 1962 to
gain the rights to deal in rubies. Most recently, Groom closed a
deal to become the sole distributor of American soft drinks in
Burma.
   And while most diamond dealers prefer to keep their actions
cloaked in secrecy, Groom, whose manner is outspoken and friendly,
seeks the spotlight. He employs his own media publicist who pitches
Groom as a modern-day Indiana Jones.
   ``There have been very few dealers who are so public,'' said Abe
Michael Shainberg, executive director of New York's exclusive
Diamond Dealers Club, considered the world's most important diamond
exchange. ``The average diamond dealer, for security reasons, does
not want such publicity. He's an honest and honorable man. His
publicity is good for his business, and good for the rest of us,
too.''
   Sitting in a small office at his fashionable store in Ridgewood,
Groom proudly showed off stones with $100,000 price tags. The
shirt-sleeved New Jersey man, who wore no jewelry, smiled and
insisted he is ``not Indiana Jones.''
   ``No intrigue,'' he said. ``But I do have a message.''
   Groom says American business can exert a positive influence
throughout the world. He is convinced the world respects the
American system, but Americans must also understand and respect
other cultures.
   ``In many cultures, the American way does not hold up,'' he
said. ``How dare we have that attitude that ours is the only way.''
   Groom's story, however, is the stuff of the American dream. He
left a successful job as a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 15
years ago after his friend's father urged him to take a gem course
that left him ``absolutely fascinated'' with precious stones.
   Groom said he struggled at first, working 15-hour days in a
one-room enterprise as his friends climbed their respective
corporate ladders. Arthur Groom &amp; Co. in Ridgewood and his American
Trading Co. in New York slowly grew into a business with offices
around the globe.
   Groom doesn't just cut deals on the telephone. He hops on planes
and goes directly to faraway mines to pick out his own stones and
diamond roughs. One of the few dealers who sells both diamonds and
colored stones, Groom is the consummate frequent flyer, logging
more than 150,000 miles each year.
   ``I wanted to do things differently,'' he said. ``I think
running just a single jewelry store is boring.''
   Avoiding boredom means taking risks.
   Amid a treasure trove of jewelry in the vault at his store is an
envelope that bears the remnants of a dramatic failure. It was a
diamond that, at the final stages of cutting in his New York
operation, ``exploded.'' The diamond's glitter was suddenly
replaced by a dull mist.
   ``It was my fault,'' he said, explaining that he had failed to
check a crucial stress point in the rock. ``It's absolutely
worthless now. It would have sold for $80,000. Eighty thousand
dollars down the drain.''
   Groom said he draws energy from his work.
   ``There's a science to picking stones in the jungle,'' he said.
``Then you go to the Diamond Dealers Club and pull up your shirt
sleeves and wheel and deal. Some Saturdays, I'll simply work the
floor of this stoor, helping an old lady who needs a $10 soldering
job on a broken chain.''
   Groom said he has changed since his younger days.
   ``I have mellowed,'' Groom said. ``Once, there was pure
aggressiveness, the hardball selling technique. Now I have a
different philosophy. We went through a period when we did things
just for money. I don't do it for the money. I can go to sleep
every night knowing we do things with integrity.''

<HEAD>Risen From Ashes, Swiss Watchmakers Face Challenges Of '90s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BIENNE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perestroika has hit Switzerland's
once-moribund watch industry: a recently launched wristwatch has a
hammer and sickle for hands and a red dial with Russian lettering.
   The perestroika model illustrates how sharp marketing with an
eye for fashion have helped restore Swiss power in world watch
markets.
   Swiss watchmakers are headed for their third straight year of
record revenue, buoyed by the success of the plastic-case Swatch, a
quartz-controlled timepiece in trendy designs. Sixty million have
been sold since 1983.
   ``We are the only ones to show we can hold off the Japanese in
mass production,'' says Nicholas G. Hayek, board president of
Switzerland's main watchmaking conglomerate, SMH, which accounts
for three-quarters of industry exports.
   He warns against complacency. Cost control and product
development are the bywords in countering Asian competition in the
fight for an estimated 500 million customers annually.
   New medium-priced Swiss models, some using stylish hardwood or
stone cases, also recaptured ground from Japanese manufacturers.
The luxury watch trade, a traditional Swiss preserve, is booming.
   In the 1970s, Far East producers rose to dominance. The Swiss
industry, unable to match their cheap digital watches and facing
high labor costs, posted big losses.
   Nowadays it has trouble finding enough qualified workers.
   With the major economies prospering, consumers will pay for
watches that are fashion accessories, not just time-tellers.
Swatches come in seasonal collections that now total several
hundred models.
   But a competitive Swiss industry re-emerged only after its 1970
workforce of 76,000 shrunk to about 30,000 and two-thirds of the
factories shut down.
   The crisis spelled doom for scattered small shops making the
more than 100 parts for a fully mechanical watch. Neat but disused
plants still dot western Switzerland's watchmaking belt.
   Hayek was tapped in the mid-1980s by commercial banks propping
up an ailing industry in which they were key shareholders.
   ``They said we have no more possibilities to fight Japanese and
Hong Kong low-cost production, we'd better stop making watches,''
Hayek, management consultant by trade, said in an interview at SMH
headquarters.
   ``We came back with a report saying the contrary.''
   Ernst Thomke, who conceived Swatch and now is SMH chief
executive, named the problems in 1982 near the peak of the crisis.
   He charged watchmakers had not pulled together and knew little
about their foreign markets, where more than 90 percent of Swiss
watches and movements are sold.
   Consolidated, automated and infused with talent, the industry
last year reported sales of $3.1 billion, a third more than the
once-leading Japanese. Another 20 percent-plus increase is expected
this year.
   Hong Kong is the top Swiss market, re-exporting most of the
shipments. The United States, Italy and West Germany follow.
   ``Every brand has a message. It has to be clear, understandable
and unique,'' says Hayek, 61, who wears three Swiss watches on his
arm.
   Swatch grabbed U.S. and European buyers with pop colors, designs
including see-through models and numberless faces, and a relatively
low price, about $31 in Switzerland. A conservative touch _ there
are no digital versions _ didn't hurt.
   Enterprising Swiss soon launched other novelties such as a
clip-on watch.
   Hayek, born in Beirut to a Lebanese mother and American father,
has run up enough successes in Switzerland to be able to operate
with maverick flair.
   Until recently, he says the watchmakers had been ``doing things
the same way for 200 years'' in a society ``where people are not
used to overcoming challenges.''
   Hayek outlines the challenge of the 1990s:
   ``Our worry is that the Swiss watch industry does not make
enough efforts to sell more watches,'' he says. ``Not only more
expensive watches, but more watches.''
   Industry leaders warn still more must be done to mass-market
``Swiss-made.'' A new push is on in Japan, where costly advertising
copied from the U.S. market had failed to generate major Swatch
sales.
   Thomke warns ``Hong Kong is stealing the show'' by focusing on
the United States, until very recently Switzerland's top export
market.
   But Hong Kong, producing at twice the Swiss rate, is running
minimal profits. Earnings in Japan's currently reorganizing
industry also are flat, analysts say.
   SMH has diversified into telephones and other electronics
fields. Group profits rose 36 percent last year to $66 million, and
Hayek is looking for U.S. investment possibilities.
   ``You have to keep your armies motivated all the time,'' Hayek
says.

   A state appeals court today threw out Ohio's
convictions of former Home State Savings Bank owner Marvin Warner
and a former president in connection with the thrift's collapse in
1985.
   Both Warner and David Schiebel have been free on bond appealing
their March 1987 convictions.
   The collapse of Cincinnanti-based Home State in 1985 triggered
Ohio's savings and loan crises of that year.
   A three-judge panel of the 1st Ohio District Court of Appeals
also threw out a lower court's order that Warner pay $22 million in
restitution to Ohio and $250,000 in prosecution costs, and that
Schiebel pay $25,000 in prosecution costs.
   The appeals court said the cost and restitution penalties were
based on a statement of fees submitted by the state that had not
been certified as correct and legal by either the prosecutor or the
clerk of the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court.
   Warner and Schiebel were convicted after a four-month trial in
Cincinnati.
   The jury convicted Warner of six charges that he oversaw
unauthorized transfers of Home State money to a major securities
trading partner, ESM Government Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.
   Home State collapsed on March 8, 1985, four days after ESM was
shut down by federal regulators for insolvency. Home State had
invested heavily with ESM through securities trades and lost $144
million when ESM closed.
   The jury also convicted Warner of three counts that he committed
securities violations by failing to give a true picture of Home
State's financial status in circulars advertising the 1984 sale of
Home State bonds.
   Warner was sentenced to 3{ years in prison.
   Warner, a millionaire businessman and former U.S. ambassador to
Switzerland during the Carter administration, was cleared by a U.S.
District Court jury in Ann Arbor, Mich., of fraud and conspiracy
charges in the failure of Home State.
   Home State's collapse caused a crisis for 69 other privately
insured Ohio savings and loans institutions whose deposits were
insured by the same agency. Gov. Richard Celeste temporarily closed
the thrifts and ordered them to obtain federal deposit insurance or
merge with companies that had it before reopening.
   Home State later was sold and reopened in June 1985 under new
ownership.

weakening trend of corporate earnings.
   Profits for the third quarter, and early indications of likely
fourth-quarter results, have contained numerous disappointments,
stirring talk of a possible business slump in early 1990.

   The rhetoric is heating up as Georgia-Pacific
Corp. pursues its spurned bid to buy Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
for $3.1 billion, though both forest-products companies deny any
nasty intent.
   Great Northern earlier this week rejected the Georgia-Pacific
offer in a pair of sharply worded letters, one to its shareholders
and the other to T. Marshall Hahn Jr., Georgia-Pacific's chairman.
   Georgia-Pacific responded with a statement to the media that
bluntly questioned the motives of Great Northern's management in
turning down the $58-a-share offer.
   Georgia-Pacific announced today that it has lined up commitments
for $4.5 billion from 19 domestic and international banks to fund
the takeover. The company said Bank of America, its primary bank
since the 1950s, has agreed to provide $1.25 billion of the amount.
   Also Tuesday, Great Northern announced it was challenging a
ruling by the Interstate Commerce Commission that cleared
Georgia-Pacific to include Great Northern's four railroads in the
proposed acquisition.
   Norwalk, Conn.-based Great Northern said the ICC approved the
clearance in one day when the process usually takes months.
   Georgia-Pacific ``cut corners'' and engaged in ``questionable
tactics'' to get the ruling, Great Northern said.
   But Great Northern Chairman William R. Laidig told The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution that he did not mean for his letter to Hahn to
seem sarcastic or harsh.
   And Georgia-Pacific President Ronald P. Hogan said in an
interview at his company's Atlanta headquarters Tuesday that he saw
straightforwardness, not anger, in Great Northern's statements.
   Hogan also said he did not expect Georgia-Pacific, which he once
described as ``a company of nice people,'' to get nasty as it
tangles over the offer.
   ``I would hope not,'' he said. ``If you come and offer me 50
percent or more (profit) for more of my assets, I would think
you're an awfully friendly guy. And I would probably embrace you
for doing that.
   ``So I don't see how offering a company 50 percent or more
premium for what its assets have been selling for for the past two
years would be considered unfriendly,'' he said.
   Hogan said Georgia-Pacific plans to continue its pursuit of
Great Northern, but declined to discuss strategy.
   Hogan said all aspects of the proposal are negotiable, though he
said the offer as it stands provides excellent short-term benefits
for Great Northern shareholders and good long-term prospects for
his company.
   Hogan also dismissed concerns raised by Great Northern about
antitrust implications of the proposed deal. He said he was not
worried, either, about an anti-takeover regulations in Maine, where
Great Northern is incorporated, that some say could block the deal.
   Hogan said various conditions _ Georgia-Pacific's confidence in
the strength of the industry, the company's ability to handle the
debt from a takeover and the compatibility of the two companies _
made the time right to launch the bid.
   A takeover of Great Northern would be one of the largest
acquisitions ever for Georgia-Pacific, a company that has often
used buyouts to grow over 62 years.
   Georgia-Pacific started in 1927 as a lumberyard in Augusta, when
founder Owen Cheatham made a $12,000 investment to start a hardwood
wholesale business known originally as the Georgia Hardwood Lumber
Co.
   The company soon began to manufacture hardwood lumber, too.
During World War II, it was the largest supplier of lumber to the
military.
   After the war, in 1947, the company made its first West Coast
acquisition, a plywood plant in Bellingham, Wash. A string of
acquisitions followed over the next 10 years.
   It was during the 1950s, too, that the company changed its name
to Georgia-Pacific and moved its headquarters to Portland, Ore.,
where it remained until coming to Atlanta in 1982.
   The company's roster of acquisitions continued to grow in the
'60s and '70s; purchases from coast to coast included paper mills,
a gypsum company, chemical plants, a kraft pulp mill, timberlands,
sawmills and an oil company.
   Last year, the company spent $841 million on acquisitions.
   Georgia-Pacific also decided about 1983 to focus more narrowly
on its pulp-and-paper and building products businesses. That
resulted in the divestiture of some of its underperforming assets,
notably the commodity chemicals business, which became Georgia Gulf
Corp.
   Great Northern, as Georgia-Pacific sees it, fits right in with
the company's growth pattern. It explains why Georgia-Pacific is
not worried about a ``white knight'' riding in to win Great
Northern in a bidding war, Hogan said.
   ``We believe that through the strategic combinations of the two
businesses ... Great Northern is more valuable to Georgia-Pacific
than it is to any other company,'' Hogan said.
   Great Northern had 1988 sales of $3.6 billion. The company owns
3.5 million acres of timberland and has 20,000 employees at mills
and factories in Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Mississippi
and Wisconsin.
   Georgia-Pacific had $9.5 billion in sales last year, making
paper, other forest products and building materials. It owns 6.5
million acres of timberland and 380 plants and mills employing
44,000 workers.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. today announced it has
reached agreement with a Boston property investment firm to
refinance the Sears Tower, the world's tallest building and the
retailer's corporate headquarters.
   The $850 million refinancing deal delays a sale of the 110-story
skyscraper in downtown Chicago for at least 15 years.
   AEW Partners, a limited partnership managed by Aldrich, Eastman
&amp; Waltch Inc., will finance a 15-year mortgage on the tower and
related properties and have an option to buy the building, Sears
said in a news release.
   The deal will produce net proceeds of $815 million for Sears,
the nation's largest retailer, which had contemplated selling the
Chicago landmark. Sears said it expects to close the deal by the
middle of next summer.
   The company said that ``as a result of lower interest rates and
the positive long-term prospects for the commercial real-estate
market, this financing transaction offers more net cash and
attractive features than alternative structures.''
   Just over a year ago, Sears announced its intention to sell the
15-year-old tower as part of a corporate restructuring designed to
halt a slide in its profitability.
   The restructuring, which brought major changes in the retailer's
merchandising and pricing policies, also included moving Sears'
retail division headquarters from the tower to an office complex
that will be built in suburban Hoffman Estates.
   Sears began exploring the refinancing option in September after
a prospective sale of the 1,707-foot building to Canadian developer
Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. collapsed. The two reportedly
couldn't agree on which party would pay the increased property
taxes certain to result from a reassessment of the property after a
sale.
   The failed deal with Olympia &amp; York was reportedly for $1
billion. When Sears first announced plans to sell the building,
real-estate experts had speculated it would fetch $1.2 billion to
$2 billion.

   The U.S. dollar fell Wednesday against most major
currencies in thin, choppy European trading. Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said there was little activity in the markets before
Thursday's release of U.S. merchandise trade figures for September.
   ``After the dollar's steep drop overnight, we had sort of a
reaction,'' said a trader at a large U.S. bank in Frankfurt. ``The
U.S. trade figures tomorrow are also preventing major activity.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell to 143.37 Japanese yen from 143.80 yen
Tuesday. Later, in London, it edged back up to 143.45 yen.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.5810, unchanged
from late Tuesday's rate.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.8382 West German marks, down from 1.8540; 1.6220 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6380; 6.2420 French francs, down from 6.2925; 2.0790
Dutch guilders, down from 2.0925; 1,348.25 Italian lire, down from
1,357.00; and 1.1726 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1710.
   Gold bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $391.25 a
troy ounce, up from $390 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to
a late bid of $391 an ounce from $389 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 43 cents to close at a bid
$391.94 an ounce.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.46 a
troy ounce, up from $5.31 late Tuesday.

   The nation's only offshore port for
supertankers hasn't had a serious spill in eight years of
operation, but it hasn't had a profit, either.
   The clean but poor Louisiana Offshore Oil Port is touted as a
savior of the environment by some and a financial failure by
others, leaving uncertain whether it will be a model for other
ports around the country.
   Known as LOOP, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port sits 19 miles off
the coast in 115 feet of water _ deep enough for the biggest
tankers in the world to tie up and unload their crude cargo.
   When it was proposed in 1972, supporters said it would cost $250
million, create tens of thousands of jobs and stimulate onshore
investments.
   Environmentalists fought the idea, warning that it was had the
potential for oil spills that could devastate Louisiana's fragile
wetlands.
   Both sets of predictions were confounded.
   LOOP cost more than $700 million and has yet to make a profit.
However, it has been so clean that Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
thinks building more deep-water ports around the country would help
avoid spills like one in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   ``The loss of oil has been just a thimble-full from every barrel
that's been through there,'' he said after a visit to the port in
September.
   ``And it confirms my original thought that the way to avoid oil
spills is to make sure that tankers don't run aground. That's
what's happened in all our oil spills.''
   LOOP looks like a three-deck offshore oil platform. Around it,
1{ miles away, are three buoys like floating, 42-foot-tall bird
cages. Tankers tie up to those buoys while they pump oil through
long hoses attached to concrete bases on the ocean floor.
   The five owners, in order of the size of their stakes, are USX
Corp.'s Marathon Oil Co., Texaco Inc., Royal Dutch Shell's Shell
Oil Co., Ashland Oil Inc., and Murphy Oil Corp. The consortium is
responsible for paying off the bonds for the project, which were
issued by a state agency to qualify for tax-exempt status.
   Former Gov. Edwin Edwards told reporters in 1974, shortly before
taking office: ``The projections are that it could pay for itself
in less than 10 years.''
   Instead LOOP, after eight years of operation, still owes $565
million on $731 million in bonds, said controller Paul Simoneaux.
   It is handling about half the projected 63 million gallons of
crude oil a day. It lost money until last year, when it broke even
for the first time.
   Will it make a profit this year?
   ``I'd rather not comment on that,'' said R.C. Thompson,
president of LOOP, Inc., a consortium of five oil companies which
own and operate the platform.
   LOOP depends on strong demand for imported oil, and backers were
stunned when Americans responded to the 1970s jump in oil prices by
conserving.
   U.S. imports of oil rose far less than expected in the 1970s and
actually fell into the mid-1980s.
   LOOP's prospects have improved now that oil imports are rising
again. Nationally, imports averaged about 8 million barrels a day
for the first 10 months of 1989.
   LOOP is geared to oil hauled from the Middle East in
supertankers _ behemoths which cannot get into most U.S. ports.
   ``Ironically, for LOOP to be successful, you have to import
foreign oil,'' Lujan said earlier this year.
   Oil imports are up around the country. ``That makes me believe
that oil ports would be successful in other places,'' Lujan said.
   LOOP has been almost squeaky clean. Thompson estimates that, out
of 1.5 billion barrels of oil brought ashore since 1981, 850 have
spilled. That works out to about a teaspoonful for every 2,300
gallons moved.
   Three gallons spilled in all of 1987.
   LOOP's location eliminates the threat of groundings and lessens
the chance that a spill could come ashore. Radar keeps a continuous
sweep over a 36-square-mile safety zone and special mooring masters
guide the big ships to and from LOOP's buoys.
   ``Exxon said it's going to cost them $1.5 billion to clean up
Prince William Sound and the surrounding area. ... Wouldn't it be
better to spend $1.5 billion to prevent oil spills than to spend it
cleaning it up?'' Lujan said.
   Environmentalists aren't convinced that superports are the
answer. Alternatives could include building tankers with double
hulls, improving traffic control and reactivating Coast Guard
stations, said Lisa Speer, senior scientist at the Natural
Resources Defense Council in New York.
   In addition, said Speer, construction and maintenance of such
ports also could hurt the environment, and beaches can be affected
by spills 20 miles away.
   ``In Rhode Island, within a few hours you had a spill that had
covered 25 square miles,'' she said. ``Offshore spills can still
impact the shore.''
   And $1.5 billion is a drop in the barrel of possible costs for a
system of offshore ports such as Lujan envisions, with deep-water
ports off of Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Alaska.
   To replicate LOOP would cost more than $800 million and probably
more than $1 billion, by various estimates. Sean Connaughton,
marine transportation associate with the American Petroleum
Institute, said he's seen estimates as high as $2 billion.
   On top of that, oil users such as refineries that now get direct
deliveries would have to hook up to a network of as-yet-unbuilt
pipelines. Building those could be even more expensive than
building the ports, Connaughton said.

   Former Wall Street stock speculator Ivan F.
Boesky was out of prison on a temporary release on the third
anniversary of his plea agreement that settled insider trading
charges, authorities said.
   Boesky is due back at the minimum-security prison at Lompoc,
Calif., about the end of the month, Ed Wolahan, the prison's
supervisor of education, said Tuesday. The furlough began last
Thursday.
   The purpose of Boesky's furlough and his whereabouts were not
known. Boesky attorney Leon Silverman declined to comment on the
furlough.
   The New York Post reported today that Boesky was spending his
time in Stamford, Conn. The paper also published photos that showed
Boesky with a scraggly white beard and long locks reminiscent of
the late, eccentric millionaire Howard Hughes. It said the pictures
were taken two days ago.
   Wolahan said Boesky applied for the temporary release, which was
approved by the prison warden. Wolahan said inmates who request
furloughs must demonstrate a need for the release, but he wouldn't
disclose Boesky's reasons.
   Boesky on Nov. 14, 1986, paid $100 million and agreed to plead
guilty to one felony to settle charges in Wall Street's biggest
insider trading scandal.
   The 52-year-old former arbitrager is eligible for release on
good behavior from a three-year term at the Lompoc Prison Camp next
April. He entered the prison, where he has been working on a
cleanup crew making 11 cents an hour, in March 1988.
   A federal judge in Manhattan in April denied a request to reduce
Boesky's sentence on the grounds that information Boesky gave the
government led to more than a dozen other civil or criminal cases
in the United States and Britain. The judge noted Boesky's
cooperation but said his sentence was ``not unjust.''
   Boesky provided information that resulted in a record $650
million plea-bargain settlement by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
the indictment of former Drexel junk-bond financier Michael Milken.
   As part of his cooperation agreement with federal authorities,
Boesky is expected to be the key witness at Milken's trial,
scheduled for next year.

<HEAD>British Airways' Profit Up 16.5 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC on Wednesday reported that its
net profit jumped 16.5 percent in the second quarter of its fiscal
year, boosted by strong passenger traffic.
   The airline, one of the world's largest, said its net profit in
the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to 106 million British pounds,
or around $172 million, from 91 million pounds, or $147.4 million,
a year earlier.
   Per-share earnings increased 16.7 percent to 14.7 pence, or 23.8
cents, from 12.6 pence, or 20.4 cents.
   ``Our profits for the second quarter are the highest yet
reported for those three months by any airline in the world,'' Lord
King, British Airways' chairman, said in a statement.
   The airline reported increased passenger traffic for the period,
including a one-month record in September of 2.2 million passengers
carried. Much of the growth came on flights between the United
States and Britain, the company said.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 13.4 percent to 1.4 billion pounds,
or $2.2 billion, from 1.2 billion pounds, or $1.9 billion.
   Last month, British Airways withdrew from a group led by pilots
and top managers seeking to buy UAL Corp. for $6.75 billion, after
the group failed to obtain adequate financing for the deal. The
British airline had planned to invest $750 million in Chicago-based
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, in return for a 15 percent
stake in the company.
   King said in the statement British Airways was ``disappointed''
that its proposed investment in UAL fell through.
   ``We will of course look for any new investment opportunities,''
he said.
   Talks on British Airways possibly taking a stake in the Belgian
airline Sabena are continuing, King said.
   He said fuel costs increased 22 percent in the six months ended
Sept. 30 and, like most European airlines, British Airways also had
to bear the costs of delays and disruptions caused by inadequate
air traffic control facilities in Europe.
   In addition, British Airways' capacity has been reduced by the
late delivery of its new Boeing 747-400 aircraft, King said. The
Machinists union has been on strike against Seattle-based Boeing
Co. since Oct. 4.
   For the six months ended Sept. 30, net profit rose 16.7 percent
to 168 million pounds, or around $265 million, from 144 million
pounds, or $227 million.
   Per-share earnings were up 16.5 percent to 23.3 pence, or 36.8
cents, from 20.0 pence, or 32.4 cents.
   Six-month revenue advanced 14.2 percent to 2.53 billion pounds,
or $3.99 billion, from 2.2 billion pounds, or $3.47 billion.

   The stock market pieced together a modest gain
today, rebounding from Tuesday's setback.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 16.18 on Tuesday,
rose 8.81 to 2,619.06 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 767 up, 624 down and
515 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders seemed to be looking ahead hopefully to
the monthly report from the government Thursday on the nation's
international trade position.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street call for a September trade
deficit of about $9 billion, down from $10.8 billion in August.
   Aside from that, brokers said worries persisted about the recent
weakening trend of corporate earnings.
   Profits for the third quarter, and early indications of likely
fourth-quarter results, have contained numerous disappointments,
stirring talk of a possible business slump in early 1990.
   The Federal Reserve has relaxed its credit policy lately in an
evident effort to cushion the impact of a slowdown in the economy.
But some observers have questioned whether the Fed acted early
enough or emphatically enough to stave off trouble.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric rose ~ to

Business Machines dropped } to 97\, and American Express was down \

   Occidental Petroleum climbed 1] to 30. Armand Hammer, the

speculation involving the stock as ``ridiculous.''
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.50 to 188.01. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .13 at 371.39.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 107.15 million shares with two

   Smirnoff vodka will be pitching a literacy
campaign rather than bottles of booze this Christmas.
   Tobacco, beer and consumer products giant Philip Morris
Companies Inc. is spending $60 million on ads celebrating the Bill
of Rights.
   Burger King Corp. dumped its regular fast-food ads over the past
month and aired commercials appealing for money for disaster relief
efforts.
   What's going on here? Have these companies lost their heads _
shucking the pursuit of profit in an altruistic frenzy, egged on by
President Bush's vision of a kinder and gentler society?
   Or have they discovered that there is prestige to be gained,
attention to be grabbed and money to be made by linking their names
to fashionable causes?
   The answer may lie somewhere in between, although some marketing
experts warn that companies who try to use altruism as a screen for
seamier bottom-line objectives risk a consumer backlash.
   ``There is a limit to how much you can wrap yourself in the
flag,'' said Mike Hughes, vice chairman and creative director at
The Martin Agency, an advertising agency based in Richmond, Va. ``A
lot of consumers are already coming away with the start of a
cynical viewpoint of this thing.''
   Companies have been associating themselves with noble causes for
years.
   ``Companies want to get the positive association, the rub-off
benefit of whatever institution or cause they are linking
themselves to,'' said Stephen A. Geyser, professor of marketing at
the Harvard Business School.
   Dozens of companies lined up, for instance, to sponsor events
tied to the restoration of the Statue of Liberty. The Olympics
offer an opportunity for companies to cash in every four years on
nationalistic fervor.
   Members Only went further, dropping its pitches for stylish
clothes three years ago and spending all its advertising money on
anti-drug messages. Even without product advertising, its sales
have risen 22 percent to about $100 million since taking the new
tack in the fall of 1986.
   But getting a sales lift is rarely the immediate objective of
spending money on good causes. More often, companies simply want to
improve their image.
   Allen Rosenshine, chairman and chief executive of the
advertising agency BBDO Worldwide, said companies promote good
causes so consumers see them ``as having a social or community
conscience.''
   That is particularly important, he said, in an era where
competing products or services in many areas are viewed as being
essentially the same.
   A shopper deciding which beer or burgers to buy may
understandably be swayed to the company that has shown in its
advertising that it shares the same values.
   ``It helps differentiate them from the competition,'' said John
Philip Jones, chairman of the advertising department at Syracuse
University's Newhouse School of Public Communications.
   Critics warn the do-good approach has its limits, and that savvy
consumers could turn on companies who use altruism as a screen for
self-serving efforts to boost market share or to ward off the
regulators.
   ``Companies have to recognize they are on thin ice here,'' said
Martin Agency's Hughes. ``If they pretend they are doing it only
for the cause, it casts a shadow on everything they do.''
   Philip Morris has come under attack from some consumer and
health groups who say the company is using the 200th anniversary of
the Bill of Rights in a cynical effort to reinforce its cigarette
unit's campaigns for smokers' rights.
   The critics are further enraged that Philip Morris struck a deal
that allows it to associate itself with the National Archives in
ads that include views of the Capitol rotunda and voices of former
presidents and other leaders.
   Philip Morris said it backed the campaign to draw attention to
an important national anniversary and to its own corporate
diversification, and denies that the ads were designed to help
protect the cigarette business from further regulation.
   The marketers of Smirnoff vodka are spending their entire $1
million holiday ad budget this year on ads for Literacy Volunteers
of America, a nonprofit group based in Syracuse, N.Y., that
recruits volunteers to teach adults how to read.
   ``Help Smirnoff end illiteracy in America,'' the ads say. The
Smirnoff logo appears in the corner.
   Charles Traynor, a marketing executive for the Heublein Inc.
division that sells Smirnoff, said Smirnoff felt a cause-related
campaign would help its ads stand out without resorting to the
``gimmicks'' such as musical computer chips that other liquor
brands have used in their Christmas ads. He said backing a cause
would also appeal to Smirnoff drinkers' ``traditional values.''
   Smirnoff is contributing $100,000 outright, paying for ads that
solicit donations and setting up special displays with a canister
in liquor stores for contributions.
   Two of the group's 370 chapters _ in Baltimore and Charleston,
W.Va. _ declined to participate.
   ``It's a hard choice to make when you are desperate for money,''
admitted Baltimore's Sister Mary Judith, who heads a community
group affiliated with Literacy Volunteers.
   Miami-based Burger King had already begun promoting its BK
Double hamburgers when an earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay
area last month.
   Chief executive Barry Gibbons told his admakers that Burger King
should ``give something back'' to communities struck by earthquakes
and hurricanes. The ads pledge to donate 25 cents to the Red Cross
for each BK Double sold through Nov. 23.
   The appeal raised $3 million in the first two weeks of the
four-week promotion.
   Still, the approach doesn't sit well with critics like Hughes.
   ``While what Burger King was doing was good, it wasn't
completely noble when they told me I had to buy a Whopper,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Two Twin Cities Radio Stations Offer Pieces Of Berlin Wall To Listeners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Twin Cities radio stations say they have
made deals to acquire small pieces of the Berlin Wall and will give
them away to listeners.
   A third station called the idea ``pretty tacky.''
   KDWB-FM made the first offer Monday morning when announcer Steve
Cochran invited listeners to win a piece of the wall by calling the
station. The 25th caller wins.
   KJJO-FM expects to start its promotion Friday. It will give away
its 40 small pieces by asking listeners to call when they hear
songs with ``wall'' in the titles.
   ``Already capitalism is working,'' said Tony Powers, operations
manager and program director of KJJO.
   Mike Boen, general manager at KTCZ said he was non-committal
when a radio syndicate offered his station pieces of the wall.
   ``My reaction was the same as my program director's: Some people
will sell anything,'' Boen said.
   The promotion ``trivializes the whole episode,'' he said. ``It
kind of hit us as pretty tacky.''
   Powers said he received a call Friday from the Jameson Group,
which syndicates programs to stations around the country. Jameson
had acquired a section of the wall from a German affiliate and ``is
using a stonemason to make these little cubes,'' Powers said.
   The price was $500 for 40 pieces sealed in plastic and
accompanied by signed certificates.
   Cochran said he didn't think the giveaway cheapens the event.
   ``It's a way of bringing it home,'' he said.

<HEAD>Postal Service Becomes Sponsor of 1992 Olympics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service announced Wednesday
that it has become an official sponsor of the 1992 Olympic Games.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank cited three reasons for the
action _ improving the image of the agency, generating increased
revenues and supporting the Olympics.
   Being a worldwide sponsor of the Olympics will cost between $10
million and $15 million, said Assistant Postmaster General Peter K.
Eichorn.
   But it is expected to generate $300 million to $400 million in
increased revenues for the service through added business in the
small parcel and express mail business and the sale of special
Olympic goods to collectors, he said.
   Every dollar in increased revenues is a dollar that doesn't have
to be obtained from higher postage rates, Frank said.
   The sponsorship costs will be shared by many other national
postal services, which will become sub-sponsors of the worldwide
Olympics and, like the U.S. Postal Service, sponsors of their
national Olympic teams. Costs will be divided according to the size
of each country and its mail volume.
   Those sponsorships include the right to use Olympic symbols on
equipment and products, including stamps issued on connection with
the event.
   The 1992 Winter Games will be held in Albertville, France, and
the Summer Games will be in Barcelona, Spain.
   Twenty-two other national postal services have already signed on
as sub-sponsors of the 1992 Olympics, Eichorn said.
   They are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus,
France, West Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan,
South Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Portugal,
Somalia, Spain and Switzerland.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by strength
in the wheat market linked to dryness in U.S. winter wheat growing
areas.
   The Agriculture Department's confirmation of new sales of wheat
to Egypt and the Philippines _ 50,000 metric tons apiece _ also
helped the wheat market, as did a report of frost damage to wheat
in Argentina.
   ``The Argentine wheat crop has been in trouble all year,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Soybean futures finished mixed, weakened by a report of
larger-than-expected stocks of Malaysian palm oil, a soybean-oil
competitor.
   Corn futures also closed mixed despite rumors of new Soviet
interest in buying U.S. corn.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2 cents to 4} cents higher with

<HEAD>Treasury Chief Says Economy Must Slow Down To Cut Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain faces a difficult year in 1990 with
continued high inflation and a slowdown in economic growth to 1.25
percent, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major said Wednesday.
   Last year's economic growth rate of 4.4 percent will be cut by
more than half to 2 percent this year, he said.
   But the economy must slow down to bring surging inflation
``decisively down, and keep it down,'' Major said in his first
autumn statement to Parliament outlining the government's public
spending plans.
   The new treasury chief made it clear that he has little
intention of easing tight monetary or fiscal policy, leaving the
prospect of continued high interest and mortgage rates and tight
control on government spending.
   But Major announced expenditures above the expected rate of
inflation in some key, and politically sensitive, areas: the
National Health Service, public transportation, higher education
and the homeless.
   Major's statement, three weeks after he replaced Nigel Lawson as
treasury chief, caused little stir on financial markets and was
welcomed by industry chiefs. ``It was a realistic prognosis of hard
times,'' said Bill Martin, chief British economist at UBS-Phillips
and Drew Ltd.
   But John Smith, the opposition Labor Party's treasury spokesman,
told the House of Commons that the government's ``economic
miracle'' had been revealed as a ``hollow sham.''
   The British government considers inflation its top economic
problem and has raised base lending rates from a low of 7.5 percent
last year to their current 15 percent level in an effort to choke
inflationary pressures.
   The annual rate of inflation rose to a peak of 8.3 percent in
June and currently stands at 7.6 percent, among the highest of
Western industrialized nations.
   ``I expect it to remain high for some months'' before falling to
5.75 percent in the last quarter of 1990, Major said.
   Inflation is running at a far higher level than Lawson forecast
in the March budget, when Britain's revenue-raising plans were
unveiled. Lawson had predicted a 5.5 percent rate in the fourth
quarter of this year dipping to 4.5 percent by the second quarter
of next year.
   ``Our main priority must be to bring inflation decisively down,
and keep it down,'' Major said. ``To achieve this, the economy must
slow down for a while. This does mean that 1990 may not be an easy
year. But the economy enters the 1990s in incomparably better shape
than it entered the 1980s.''
   The chancellor forecast a steep rise this year in the country's
current account deficit, which includes invisible trade such as
overseas investment earnings as well as merchandise trade.
   The deficit will soar to 20 billion pounds, or $31.6 billion, in
1989 from last year's 14.6 billion pounds, or $23 billion. This was
a 38 percent increase over Lawson's March forecast of a deficit of
14.5 billion pounds, or $22.9 billion, this year.
   Major projected a 1990 deficit of 15 billion pounds, or $24
billion, as the economy braked and the demand for imports shrank.
   Lawson had said that a widening current account deficit this
year shouldn't be of significant concern, maintaining it was due to
heavy investment in British industry and was not chiefly the result
of consumer spending.
   Major, however, linked the shortfall to unanticipated growth in
consumer spending. But he said that he anticipated improvement in
1990 due to growth of already strong exports and a reduction in
domestic demand.
   ``As domestic demand slows, import growth should moderate,''
Major said. ``At the same time, the strong rise in exports, which

   The stock market turned upward today, rebounding
from Tuesday's setback.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 16.18 on Tuesday,
rose 12.50 to 2,622.75 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 835 up, 599 down and
501 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders seemed to be looking ahead hopefully to
the monthly report from the government Thursday on the nation's
international trade position.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street call for a September trade
deficit of about $9 billion, down from $10.8 billion in August.
   Aside from that, brokers said worries persisted about the recent
weakening trend of corporate earnings.
   Profits for the third quarter, and early indications of likely
fourth-quarter results, have contained numerous disappointments,
stirring talk of a possible business slump in early 1990.
   The Federal Reserve has relaxed its credit policy lately in an
evident effort to cushion the impact of a slowdown in the economy.
But some observers have questioned whether the Fed acted early
enough or emphatically enough to stave off trouble.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric rose 1 to
56{; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph gained ] to 43\; International
Business Machines dropped { to 97{, and American Express was down [
at 33{.
   Occidental Petroleum climbed 1{ to 30[. Armand Hammer, the
company's 91-year-old chief executive, described recent takeover
speculation involving the stock as ``ridiculous.''
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.75 to 188.26. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .06 at 371.46.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 125.84 million shares with an

   The Senate today refused for the second day in
the row to shut off debate on President Bush's proposed
capital-gains tax cut, killing the issue for the year.
   The vote was 51-47, nine short of the 60 required to limit
debate. The margin was the same on Tuesday.
   ``In the end, we will win this battle'' next year, Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., said after the first vote.
   Congressional leaders had agreed in advance that the two days of
Senate debate on the proposal would put the issue to rest until
next year.
   At the White House earlier today, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters, ``We consider yesterday's vote just the
beginning.''
   Bush promised a capital gains cut in last year's presidential
campaign as a way to encourage investment and create jobs. The
proposal has dominated debate over budget issues for several months.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, pleaded for
Democratic loyalty and assailed Bush for spending so much effort to
win the cut. A reduction, Mitchell said, would bloat the deficit by
tens of billions of dollars in the long run and serve up a major
tax windfall for the nation's richest people.
   ``This amendment evinces no concern about investment or with the
future,'' Mitchell said. ``It is concerned only with the present
and the political benefits that may flow from cutting taxes....
   ``Given our circumstances, when so many in our nation are
without decent housing, cannot afford an education, lack health
insurance, it is a travesty that the Senate should now be seriously
considering a huge tax cut for the very wealthy with no evidence
that it will assist the economy,'' Mitchell said.
   Economists estimate that 80 percent of the benefit of a cut in
taxes on capital gains _ profits from the sale of investments _
would go to people with incomes above $100,000 a year. Those with
incomes above $200,000 would get tax cuts averaging $24,000.
   Republicans accused opponents of engaging in class-warfare
rhetoric.
   ``This is a situation where everyone gains,'' said Packwood,
contending a tax cut would benefit investors while producing
increased revenue for the government to spend on social programs.
``You don't get many deals better than that.''
   The House, with backing of one of every four Democrats, approved
a different capital gains cut in September.
   Present law fully taxes capital gains at the same rates that
apply to wages and other income.
   The Packwood-Roth plan would mean lower taxes for capital gains;
the longer an asset was held, the less of the profit from its sale
would be taxed.
   Only 95 percent of the profit from the sale of an asset owned
more than one year would be taxed. That percentage would increase
by five points for each additional year up to seven; only 65
percent of the gain would be taxed when property owned more than
seven years is sold.
   Investments in smaller companies would get an even better break;
up to 50 percent could escape taxation.
   The Senate proposal, written by Packwood and Sen. Bill Roth,
R-Del., would combine a capital gains tax cut with expanded
Individual Retirement Accounts. Unlike existing IRAs, which permit
some workers to avoid tax on contributions of up to $2,000 a year,
the new version would simply exempt from tax any inerest earned on
an IRA.
   In addition, a worker could make penalty-free withdrawals from
the new IRAs for paying medical or education expenses.

<HEAD>Slumping Regional Real Estate Market Leading to Rise In Foreclosures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An increasing number of residential properties are
being sold on the auction block as the region's slumping real
estate market prompts foreclosures on homes and developments that
have trouble attracting buyers.
   ``We are seeing some foreclosures in our area. Where there used
to be one or two, now there seems to be more,'' Carol Sager,
co-owner of Century 21 Sager Real Estate in Lowell, said Wednesday.
   The state Land Court in Boston has seen a steep increase in
foreclosures and auctions of all kinds across Massachusetts,
although banking officials say owners of single-family homes have
not been hit as hard as condominium developers.
   In 1987, 253 foreclosure filings culminated with an auction,
meaning no one stepped in to pay off the mortgage. Last year the
number rose to 546 and this year the total already has reached
1,100.
   Charles Trombly, recorder for the court, said the figures are
not broken down into specific categories.
   ``It's everything,'' he said. ``It's condos. It's people who get
laid off at Wang who get in over their heads.''
   Banking officials blame much of the trouble on a real estate
boom earlier this decade that led to an oversupply of building
space, especially in condominiums.
   Robert Eisenberg, president of New England Financial Resources
Inc. in Boston, which manages assets for banks, said some of the
outlying areas from Boston have been particularly troublesome for
developers trying to sell condominiums.
   ``I think it's very clear in southern New Hampshire there was a
bit more optimism exhibited than there should have been,''
Eisenberg said. ``Certainly there was not a lot of sober thought
given to some of these projects.''
   ``The foreclosures have accelerated at an accelerating pace,''
he said. ``Bankruptcy is a growth industry. And unfortunately,
there is a lot of human suffering.''
   Such an example came earlier this year, when Andrew Lane of
Southborough, the state's largest housing developer headquartered
in Massachusetts, filed for bankruptcy protection. Lane blamed the
region's slow real estate market for his company's problems.
   Bankruptcy filings in New England are up about 50 percent from
last year, and more than half are related to real estate projects,
said Virginia Greiman, U.S. trustee whose office monitors
bankruptcy cases for the New England region.
   Greiman said many people file for bankruptcy protection from
creditors to buy time in the foreclosure process.
   ``You have developers with all these condo projects and no one
buying them, so they have no cash flow to meet their expenses,''
she said.
   While condominium developers have been hit hard, bank officials
say owners of single-family homes have not had as much trouble.
Foreclosures on houses correlate less directly to the real estate
market and stem more from general economic conditions, such as
unemployment, which result in people having trouble paying their
bills.
   Despite a wave recent layoffs in the high tech industry,
regional unemployment remains relatively low, so forecasts of a
recession have not yet translated to a surge of foreclosures on
houses, said Bill Jones, vice president at BancBoston Mortgage
Corp., a subsidiary of Bank of Boston.
   Jones said that about 1.6 percent of his bank's residential
loans are delinquent, compared with about 1.5 percent at the same
time last year.
   Firms that conduct auctions, nonetheless, report that some
homeowners are losing their houses to foreclosure.
   Mark Enik, president of U.S. Auction Inc. in Hyannis, said many
of these people bought second homes, such as around Cape Cod, and
now are having trouble making payments.
   These people also have trouble selling the homes because they
were bought when prices were peaking, and the houses end up being
auctioned.
   ``They thought they can always sell the property in the worst
case,'' Enik said. ``But a lot of them cannot sell.''

<HEAD>Farmland Values in Midwest Continue to Rise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of farmland in the Midwest
continues to rebound and agricultural bankers in five states expect
interest in the land market to be active through this winter, a
Federal Reserve Bank analyst said Wednesday.
   A new survey of 500 bankers by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago said the value of farmland in the Midwest rose 1.7 percent
during the third quarter of 1989.
   ``We've had quite a sharp rebound in farm-sector earnings and
that has been an important factor in the increases in farmland
values,'' said Gary Benjamin, analyst for the reserve bank.
   ``In addition, people's expectations of the future have improved
and one factor is the uptrend in farm exports,'' Benjamin added.
``People think that trend in exports will continue.''
   Farmland values in the Midwest peaked around 1981 and then began
a decline that lasted more than five years and cut the price of
some farmland in half.
   Benjamin said the recovery began late in 1986.
   ``Many of the bankers expect the farmland market to remain
active this fall and winter, with continued interest by both farmer
and nonfarmer investors,'' he said.
   There was some variation in farmland values among the five
Midwest states during July, August and September.
   Wisconsin farmland values rose 3.6 percent during the third
quarter, while Illinois and Iowa posted gains of about 2 percent.
There was virtually no change in Indiana and Michigan from the
second quarter.
   On an annual basis, farmland values in the five states are up 8
percent from a year ago. Illinois and Indiana logged the biggest
increases with 9 percent increases. The smallest gain was
Michigan's 4 percent.
   Benjamin said nearly 32 percent of the bankers surveyed expect
the value of farmland in their areas to rise during the fourth
quarter of this year.
   Interest rates on real-estate loans, which had risen over a
two-year period ending early this year, have recorded two
consecutive quarterly declines, Benjamin said. The average rate at
the end of the third quarter was 11.34 percent.
   Many bankers expect both farmers and other investors to buy more
farmland in the Midwest through early spring.
   ``More than a third of the respondents stated they expect the
volume of farmland transfers over the next six months to be higher
than the comparable period of a year ago, while an additional 53
percent expect no change,'' said Benjamin.
   More than 36 percent of the bankers surveyed said they expect
the demand for farmland to increase among investors who are not
currently farming, he said.

<HEAD>Sears Takes Tower Off Market, Borrows $850 Million Against It</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. removed the ``for sale''
sign Wednesday from the world's tallest building, saying it had
decided not to sell Sears Tower but to use it as collateral for an
$850 million loan.
   Sears said it expected to sign by mid-summer a 15-year
convertible mortgage agreement with AEW Partners, a limited
partnership formed by Aldrich, Eastman &amp; Waltch Inc., a pension
fund real-estate investment manager based in Boston.
   The deal will provide Sears with $815 million after expenses and
give AEW an option to buy the 110-story downtown Chicago landmark
at the end of the loan period, said Douglas Fairweather, a Sears
spokesman.
   If AEW chooses to take possession of the 1,707-foot building
rather than accept repayment of the loan, Fairweather said, the
partnership would be required to pay Sears the balance of the
tower's full 1989 value as well as a portion of its appreciated
value.
   Chicago-based Sears, the nation's largest retailer and a
financial-services leader, announced just over a year ago that it
would sell its 15-year-old headquarters building as part of a
corporate restructuring designed to halt a slide in its profits.
   But after a prospective sale of the tower to Canadian developer
Olympia &amp; York Developments Inc. fell through in September, Sears
decided to take advantage of a drop in interest rates and refinance
the tower, which it owns free and clear.
   When Sears announced plans on Oct. 31, 1988, to sell the
building, ``we said that what we wanted to do was take out the
appreciated value of this asset to invest in our core businesses
and repurchase 10 percent of our shares,'' Fairweather said.
   ``While a sale seemed to be a better way to achieve our
objectives when we made this announcement, by the time we did this
deal, financing the building was a better alternative,'' he said.
   Interest rates on long-term loans for prime real estate such as
Sears Tower have fallen by as much as a full percentage point, to
about 9 percent, in the past year, said John Oharenko, managing
partner in the Chicago office of Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc., a
commercial real-estate firm.
   Commercial real-estate loans typically reflect up to 80 percent
of a property's fair market value, he said.
   Fairweather said Sears will use proceeds from the tower deal to
pay down debt incurred through its repurchase over the past year of
about 40 million shares of its stock at about $40 a share, and to
invest in its core businesses, which include the Sears retailing
division, Dean Witter Reynolds brokerage services, Allstate
insurance and Coldwell Banker real estate.
   Sears' restructuring also includes a plan to move its retailing
headquarters from Sears Tower to a yet-to-be built office complex
in suburban Hoffman Estates by the end of 1992.
   Some of Chicago's commercial real estate experts have said the 2
million square feet of office space to be vacated by the retailing
division is badly in need of remodeling, both to modernize the
facilities and to subdivide it into smaller areas.
   Fairweather indicated that Sears would be doing some remodeling
in the tower.
   ``Even though it's a world-class building, we're aware of the
fact there are opportunities to enhance its value and we'll be
doing that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Multimedia Mix 'n' Match May Be Getting Past Hype</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Desktop video for personal computers is finally
getting past the hype stage, many computer experts say.
   New computers and software let users knit writing and sounds
together with graphics, video and animation in a package that lets
the user control the images and ``talk back.''
   Interactive multimedia or desktop video, the jargon phrases for
all this, ``is like desktop publishing three years ago,'' according
to Sam Albert, a longtime executive for International Business
Machines Corp. who now runs a consulting business in Scarsdale, N.Y.
   ``This thing is exploding very rapidly,'' Albert said Wednesday,
the third day of the huge Comdex computer convention in Las Vegas.
   Tim Bajarin, a strategic planning consultant to IBM, Apple
Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp. and other companies, has
compiled the names of 350 people already producing multimedia.
   Sample uses: worker trainees watch a master repairman in action
rather than read a boring manual, a salesman calls up video images
of swatches of cloth and suggested configurations of desks and
chairs for buyers of office furniture.
   The recreational possibilities are also amazing, with the
potential for home computer users to integrate the functions of
stereos, videocassettes and compact disks.
   The promise of the technology was blasted home to
convention-goers Monday by keynote speaker George H. Conrades,
senior vice president at ordinarily conservative IBM and a pretty
fair drummer back in his college days.
   In a presentation that was more show than speech, Conrades
pulled out his drumsticks and started blamming away on synthetic
drums as part of an extravagant demonstration of controllable sight
and sound.
   At a touch, Conrades summoned images of swooping eagles,
careening roller coasters and bridges that collapsed at whatever
speed he chose _ or whatever speed a structural engineer might
choose, which was the point he was making.
   ``Opportunity is everywhere,'' Conrades said, noting that
despite the maturing of the computer industry, 90 percent of the
businesses in the country are still without computers.
   Training, education and sales are vast and obvious markets, with
applications from the mundane to the sublime.
   John McCloskey of Leader Systems showed off a program that
explains the complexities of insurance, with specifics on various
plans available at a touch.
   UCLA music history professor Robert Winter uses multimedia to
teach Beethoven: a click of the ``mouse'' controlling his Macintosh
produces biographical tidbits; another click might produce a
musical theme or additional fragments to show how it's developed.
   Because desktop computers have become so powerful, they can now
hold and manipulate enough information fast enough to produce
controllable television images with breathtaking resolution,
pictures far sharper than on a conventional TV.
   That could mean, for example, that images of every picture in
the Louvre can be stored for retrieval by art lovers or students
who could zoom right in on Mona Lisa's smile, clear as a bell,
experts said at a panel discussion involving officials of IBM,
Apple and Commodore International Ltd., which makes the Amiga.
   With add-ons to funnel sound, video and text in and combine them
with computer-generated graphics and text, multimedia can now be
done for perhaps $5,000, compared with $50,000 just a few years
ago, the experts said.
   David Archambault, director of project marketing for Commodore,
used an Amiga to generate an impromptu commercial that combined
pictures of the computers, music and a swirling, animated company
logo.
   Archambault said that $2 billion is spent every year in the
United States on computers for education alone.
   ``We feel multimedia is deliverable to a number of these niche
markets today,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The board of Aristech Chemical Corp. said it
will respond by the end of November to an $817 million takeover bid
by Utah industrialist Jon M. Huntsman.
   The board said in a statement Tuesday that ``further study and
deliberation are required'' before it will respond to Huntsman's
$25-per-share offer, which was made Oct. 12.
   Aristech spokesman J. Harry Varner declined further comment.
   In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Aristech
was down 37{ cents a share at $22.12{.
   Huntsman, of Salt Lake City and whose family owns Huntsman
Chemical Co., the nation's largest privately held chemical company,
said he believes the board is seriously considering his offer and
not stalling for time.
   ``Irrespective of aberrations in the marketplace, and the
weakening of bridge financing and junk bonds, I've left my offer
intact,'' he said. ``I think they appreciate my consistency and
steadfastness.''
   According to a filing Oct. 16 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Huntsman's group owned an 8.4 percent stake in Aristech.
   Aristech earned $67 million, or $1.93 a share, in the nine
months ended Sept. 30, on revenue of $773.8 million. It earned
$153.3 million, or $4.07 a share, in the same period in 1988 on
revenue of $806.7 million.
   The 1988 results included a $23.7 million credit due to an
accounting change.

<TEXT>
   Wholesale home heating oil prices fell
Wednesday, weighed down by sluggish demand due to unusually warm
weather on the East Coast. Crude oil and gasoline futures prices
rose.
   Contracts for December delivery of No.2 heating oil declined
0.32 cent to 57.13 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after losing 0.23 cent on Tuesday. Later contract months
also finished lower.
   Jerry Samuels, an energy broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
said the latest production and inventory report from the American
Petroleum Institute showed higher-than-expected heating oil stocks,
reflecting slack demand.
   ``It is going to get cold here one day but there isn't much
demand now for heating oil because of the exceptionally warm
weather'' in the East, said Samuels.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures held up despite the selling in
the heating oil pits.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 17 cents to settle at $19.67 per
42-gallon barrel after declining 9 cents on Tuesday. Contracts for
delivery through March 1990 posted more modest gains.
   Contracts for wholesale unleaded gasoline for December increased
0.30 cent to 50.61 a gallon, recouping some of Tuesday's 0.75-cent
drop. Contracts for later delivery also advanced.
   Samuels said gasoline prices got support from the weekly API
report, which was released late Tuesday after trading was done for
the day. There was a larger amount of gasoline drawn from
inventories than expected, the API said.

<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board Options Exchange is
investigating reports of program-trading abuses to determine
whether rules were violated during days of hectic trading, exchange
officials said Wednesday.
   The world's largest options marketplace is looking at trading in
Standard &amp; Poor's 100 stock-index options during the Oct. 13 market
plunge as well as on other volatile trading days, said CBOE
President Charles Henry.
   The CBOE is the fourth major exchange to search for
program-trading abuses. The New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange are conducting
separate probes of computer-assisted program trading in stocks and
stock-index futures.
   Those three exchanges have tightened surveillance measures and
imposed stiff fines after long-term federal scrutiny resulted in
numerous indictments and convictions.
   Henry downplayed the CBOE investigation, saying the exchange has
routinely monitored days of heavy trading since 1987.
   ``We have an ongoing study,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``We also make sure participants in our market behave as they are
supposed to.''
   Program trading is the rapid buying and selling of stocks by
computer to take advantage of temporary price differences. A stock
index option is the right to buy or sell the underlying value of a
stock index, such as the S&amp;P 100, at a specified price within a
specified time.
   The CBOE is looking at ``sources of volatility,'' including
trades _ program or otherwise _ that may have involved manipulation
or other forms of rule-breaking, Henry said.
   For years, the exchange has been the subject of rumors about
program-trading abuses _ rumors prompted partly by the complexity
of options-related program-trading strategies.
   Program trading involving stock-index options, commonly called
OEX, has also been blamed as a contributor to stock market
volatility.
   Tom Bond, CBOE vice president, pointed to three particular days
of heavy trading that are under scrutiny.
   One was Oct. 13 when the Dow Jones industrial average fell
190.58 points, its second biggest one-day point loss ever. The
second was Oct. 16 when the Dow rallied 88.12 points. The third day
was Oct. 24, when the Dow Jones industrials dropped 80 points
before rallying to finish the day with a 3.69-point loss.
   The CBOE's scrutiny of trading practices may date back to a
class-action lawsuit filed against the exchange after the October
1987 stock market crash.
   A group of more than 1,000 investors contend in the lawsuit that
the CBOE and floor traders responsible for making markets in
certain options on the S&amp;P 100 violated federal law and the
exchange's own rules by charging inflated prices for options
contracts.
   In May, the Securities and Exchange Commission censured the CBOE
for failing to enforce its own rules on trading manipulation
involving stocks and options on Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.
   Program trades involving the S&amp;P 100 options accounted for 8
percent to 19 percent of total index arbitrage volume between
November 1988 and April 1989, the SEC noted.

   Money-losing Eastern Airlines is keeping cut-rate
fares to Florida this winter in an effort to bring back passengers,
officials said Wednesday.
   ``What we're really doing is generating revenue,'' said George
Brennan, Eastern's vice president for marketing. ``We know a lot
about Florida and how to stimulate travel ... We have an awful lot
of seats coming into Florida this winter.
   ``The existing fare structure ... is a fare structure that is
doing nothing to stimulate travel into Florida,'' Brennan said.
``Our objective obviously is to make money.''
   The fares, with relatively few restrictions, are effective
immediately for travel between nine Florida cities and 45 other
U.S. cities.
   They are significant because the airline industry usually boosts
winter season fares to vacation points, Eastern officials said. The
majority of fliers to Florida are discretionary, or leisure
travelers, Brennan said, spurring Eastern to offer incentives to
them.
   A Miami-to-New York fare, based on round-trip purchase, would be
$99 each way midweek, compared with a current fare of $139. In many
cases, Eastern is maintaining ``back-in-business'' discount fares
aimed at regaining business lost since the airline was hit by a
strike on March 4 and entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
five days later.
   Passengers must make reservations before Dec. 15 and purchase
their tickets _ if space is available _ seven days in advance. The
tickets are fully refundable, Brennan said. Although the fares are
part of a winter promotion, reservations can be made for anytime in
the future, he said, and will be honored with seven-day advance
purchase.
   The fares require two-night stays, but the nights don't have to
be on a weekend, he said. Blackout dates, on which normal fares
apply, are southbound (into Florida) Dec. 21-26 and northbound (out
of Florida) Jan. 1-3.
   A fare structure effective Jan. 6 will continue to offer
discounts below industry averages but about $20 each way higher
than Eastern's bargain fares.
   Miami-based Eastern is flying 335 flights in and out of the nine
Florida cities: Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Tampa,
Orlando, Daytona Beach, Sarasota, Fort Myers and Melbourne.
   Eastern's announcement came after last week's third-quarter
report showed a net loss of $185.2 million amid indications the
airline has informed its major creditors of a $200 million cash
shortfall.
   ``It is used more as a marketing tool to attract attention,''
said Robert Joedicke, an airline analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York. ``It's calculated to create a loss, but
it's calculated to regain critical mass, or market share. (Eastern
must) be particularly active to win people back.''
   Eastern officials, trying to rebuild without the unions, have
said the airline will emerge from bankruptcy early next year at
nearly 90 percent its pre-strike size. Eastern is back to 775 daily
flights, compared with nearly 1,100 before the ongoing strike began.

   The dollar ended higher Wednesday in domestic
trading against major foreign currencies after declining overseas.
   Gold prices fell in New York after rising overseas. On the
Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery
closed at $391.30 a troy ounce, down $2 from late Tuesday. Republic
National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $390.90 an
ounce, off $1.60.
   Ronald Holzer, a vice president and chief dealer for Harris
Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, attributed the dollar's gains in New York
partly to ``a small correction from yesterday's selloff ahead of
the trade figures.''
   The Commerce Department is scheduled to release the merchandise
trade figures for September on Thursday, and the market sentiment
is that it would show a narrowing of the deficit to between $8
billion and $9 billion.
   However, Holzer said that if the report reveals further economic
weakness, particularly by showing a decline in U.S. exports, the
dollar could head lower. ``The fundamentals are still working
against the dollar,'' he said.
   Several recent economic reports have pointed to an economic
slowdown, which spells bad news for dollar investors because it
could signal lower interest rates. Lower rates tend to depress a
currency.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell to 143.37 Japanese yen from 143.80 yen
Tuesday. It traded at 143.45 yen in London, and rose to 143.795 yen
in New York from 143.05 yen late Tuesday.
   The British pound traded at $1.5810 in London, unchanged from
late Tuesday's rate. In New York, the pound fell to $1.5803 from
$1.5945.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
quotes, included: 1.8390 West German marks, up from 1.8350; 1.6265
Swiss francs, up from 1.6175; 6.2495 French francs, up from 6.2280;
1,351.75 Italian lire, up from 1,343.00; and 1.17095 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.16975.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Tuesday,
included: 1.8382 West German marks, down from 1.8540; 1.6220 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6380; 6.2420 French francs, down from 6.2925;
2.0790 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0925; 1,348.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,357.00; and 1.1726 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1710.
   Gold bullion rose in London to a late bid of $391.25 an ounce
from $390 Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a late bid of $391 an
ounce from $389.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 43 cents to close at $391.94 an
ounce.
   Silver prices strengthened. On the New York Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $5.528 a troy ounce, up
12.8 cents from late Tuesday. Silver rose in London to $5.46 an
ounce from $5.31.

   The stock market snapped out of a brief sinking
spell with a rally Wednesday encouraged by declining interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 16.18 on Tuesday,
rebounded 22.33 points to 2,632.58.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
926 up, 595 down and 465 unchanged.
   Interest rates fell a bit in the Treasury bond market Wednesday.
   Analysts said traders seemed to be looking ahead hopefully to
the monthly report from the government Thursday on the nation's
international trade position.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street call for a September trade
deficit of about $9 billion, down from $10.8 billion in August.
   Aside from that, brokers said worries persisted about the recent
weakening trend of corporate earnings.
   Profits for the third quarter, and early indications of likely
fourth-quarter results, have contained numerous disappointments,
stirring talk of a possible business slump in early 1990.
   The Federal Reserve has relaxed its credit policy lately in an
evident effort to cushion the impact of a slowdown in the economy.
But some observers have questioned whether the Fed acted early
enough or emphatically enough to stave off trouble.
   Among the blue chips that contributed to the Dow Jones
industrials' gain, General Electric rose 1\ to 56}; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph { to 43]; Procter &amp; Gamble 2] to 129{;
Coca-Cola } to 74, and Eastman Kodak { to 42|.
   Occidental Petroleum climbed 1{ to 30[. Armand Hammer, the
company's 91-year-old chief executive, described recent takeover
speculation involving the stock as ``ridiculous.''
   IBP Inc., which is 51 percent owned by Occidental, added 1[ to
15|. Occidental said it turned down two offers earlier this year
for its stake in the beef-processing concern.
   Baker Hughes rose 1\ to 24\. The company reported higher
operating income for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30.
   Among other energy issues, Chevron gained 2 to 63|; Amerada-Hess
} to 44~; Texaco } to 52}; Schlumberger 1[ to 43[, and Halliburton
1{ to 38~.
   M-A-Com, which discontinued its quarterly dividend, slipped [ to
5|, trading at 10-year lows.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 155.13 million
shares, against 143.17 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 182.89 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $18.93 billion, or
0.57 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.25 to 188.76.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.07 to 388.16, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.55 at 340.54.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 1.81 to 455.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 372.15, up .63.

<HEAD>Citicorp Chairman: Argentina Must Pay Overdue Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp Chairman John Reed said
Wednesday that Argentina will have to pay at least part of its
overdue interest before foreign banks will consider loaning it more
money.
   ``There is no doubt the banks that hold Argentina's external
debt are concerned'' by the overdue interest, Reed told a news
conference.
   Argentina is the third biggest debtor nation in the developing
world. Early last year the government fell behind in interest
payments. Principal payments were deferred several years ago.
   Argentina's debt to foreign commercial banks, governments and
agencies like the World Bank amounts to about $60 billion, plus
about $4.5 billion in overdue interest.
   Citibank, which is operated by Citicorp, is owed about $1.5
billion, more than any other U.S. bank except Manufacturers Hanover
Trust.
   Reed said foreign bankers approve of President Carlos Menem's
program of economic austerity and structural reform.
   Initial debt talks with commercial banks in New York were held
last month. Argentina reportedly is seeking to borrow another $3
billion.

   Silver futures prices soared to six-month highs Wednesday while
gold and platinum, the recent leaders of the surging precious
metals group, fell back.
   On other commodity markets, pork futures prices rose sharply
amid talk of further food aid to Poland, grains and soybeans were
mostly higher and energy futures were mixed.
   Silver futures settled 13 cents to 15.1 cents higher on New
York's Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in
December at $5.538 a troy ounce, the highest price for a near-month
silver contract since May 12.
   Gold finished $1.90 to $2.10 lower on the Comex with December at
$392.80 a troy ounce; platinum settled $5.20 to $5.30 lower on the
New York Mercantile Exchange with January at $520.40 a troy ounce.
   Precious metals prices have risen broadly since Oct. 13, when a
190-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials average triggered a
rush of investment dollars to the perceived safety of the metals.
   But the silver market has lagged behind gold and platinum,
possibly because silver is in greater supply. From Oct. 13 through
Tuesday, gold prices had risen by 7.5 percent, platinum by 6.9
percent and silver by just 4.9 percent.
   Silver played catch-up on Wednesday, pushing its gains since
Friday the 13th to 7.8 percent.
   ``I view it as the rubber-band effect,'' said Bernard Savaiko,
senior metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York. ``Platinum
and gold had already had good moves and investors veiwed silver as
too cheap relative to gold.''
   Some traders express the silver-gold price relationship in terms
of the number of ounces of silver it would take to equal the value
of one ounce of gold. A ratio in excess of 70-to-1 is often
interpreted by professional traders as a signal to buy silver and
sell gold, said James Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc.
   At the close of trading Tuesday, the silver-gold ratio was about
73-to-1, and it approached 74-to-1 early in Wednesday's session. At
that point, Steel said, ``the logical thing was to switch into the
silver market.''
   Pork futures prices skyrocketed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange after White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
United States probably would send more food aid to Poland.
   The government already has committed to send 10,000 metric tons
of pork bellies to Poland as part of a food-aid package.
   Firm cash markets also supported the pork and cattle markets.
   Live cattle settled .23 cent to .55 cent higher with December at
74.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .45 cent higher
with November at 83.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent to
1.37 cents higher with December at 49.27 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .72 cent to 1.38 cents higher with February at 63.87
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade, paced by strength in the wheat market linked to
dryness in U.S. winter wheat growing areas.
   The Agriculture Department's confirmation of new sales of wheat
to Egypt and the Philippines _ 50,000 metric tons apiece _ also
helped the wheat market, as did a report of frost damage to wheat
in Argentina.
   Wheat settled 2\ cents to 4} cents higher with December at $4.05
a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 2 cents higher with December at
$2.39} a bushel; oats were } cent to 1{ cents higher with December
at $1.45} a bushel; soybeans were } cent lower to 4} cents higher
with November at $5.79{ a bushel.
   Wholesale home heating oil prices fell on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, weighed down by sluggish demand due to
unusually warm weather on the East Coast. Crude oil and gasoline
futures were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .08 cent lower to .17
cent higher with December at $19.67 a barrel; heating oil was .05
cent to .61 cent lower with December at 57.13 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .20 cent lower to .30 cent higher with
December at 50.61 cents a gallon.

   Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee
accepted $1.46 million in contributions from lobbyists trying to
weaken anti-racketeering laws, consumer activist Ralph Nader said
Wednesday.
   The committee on Thursday is to consider a bill changing a
provision in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(RICO), which permits civil plaintiffs to recover triple damages
from white-collar criminals.
   Public Citizen, a group founded by Nader, told a news conference
that trade groups representing accountants, savings and loans,
securities and commodities firms, banks and insurance companies
showered the 14 members of the Senate panel with contributions from
1983 to 1988.
   Nader took particular aim at Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who
accepted $213,450 and is the sponsor of the reform bill.
   DeConcini and four other senators have come under fire for
meeting with savings and loan regulators on behalf of Phoenix,
Ariz., millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., a heavy contributor to
their campaigns.
   Keating is chairman of the parent company of Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association, of Irvine, Calif. The institution's failure is
expected to cost taxpayers up to $2 billion.
   In an attempt to recover some of the loss, regulators have filed
a $1.1 billion civil RICO suit against Keating and his associates.
   ``Now the ringleader of the Keating Five, clearly the most
shamelessly shameless of all senators, Sen. DeConcini, ... would
weaken the very law used by regulators and victims of corporate
crime against his friend Charles Keating,'' Nader said. ``This has
to be the acme of congressional presumption.''
   DeConcini, in a statement, responded that he supported narrowing
RICO because it has been misused to target legitimate businesses.
His bill specifically permits bank regulators to seek triple
damages and would not benefit special interests, he said.
   The senator said his original bill would have applied to pending
lawsuits, such as the one filed against Keating, but has been
changed so that it affects only suits filed after the legislation
passed.
   A coalition of business, labor and civil liberties groups
backing RICO changes issued a statement saying it was ``appalled
that Public Citizen would personally attack'' DeConcini and labeled
the news conference ``a last ditch effort to stop a vote on RICO
reform legislation.''
   Ramona E. Jacobs, a Glendale, Calif., woman who lost $11,000 in
the Lincoln failure, complained at the news conference that
DeConcini, who conducted a hearing on his bill in June, would not
allow her to testify on behalf of fraud victims.
   Without triple damages in such civil suits, ``wrongdoers will
quickly find out that crime _ particularly against defenseless
citizens _ pays,'' said Ms. Jacobs, who said her loss included an
insurance settement from an automobile accident that left her
daughter brain damaged.
   Colorado Securities Commissioner Philip A. Feigin, speaking on
behalf of the North American Securities Administrators Association,
said the DeConcini bill represents ``a concession of colossal
proportions'' and ``the emasculation of the single most potent
weapon against white-collar crime.''
   According to Public Citizen, the other senators on the Judiciary
panel, in addition to DeConcini, and the contributions they
received from 1983 through 1988 from the targeted trade groups were:
   Arlen Specter, R-Pa., $240,632; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
$219,250; Howell Heflin, D-Ala., $157,400; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
$128,600; Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., $117,903; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
$92,025; Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. and the ranking minority member,
$89,075; Paul Simon, D-Ill., $74,500; Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.,
$62,350; Joseph Biden, D-Del., the chairman of the committee,
$36,750; Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, $19,500, and Herbert Kohl,
D-Wis., who was elected for the first time last year, zero.

   The Labor Department on Wednesday sought to
quell fears about private pension fund fraud, telling Congress the
system has ``never been healthier,'' but a House panel chairman
said there is reason for concern.
   David George Ball, an assistant labor secretary, appeared before
the House retirement income subcommittee to dispute warnings from
his department's own inspector general's office about the potential
for fraud.
   At the same hearing, the acting inspector general, Raymond
Maria, said lax auditing and enforcement have created a ``window of
opportunity'' for unscrupulous managers to pilfer Americans'
pensions.
   Rep. Bill Hughes, D-N.J., chairman of the Subcommittee on
Retirement Income and Employment, said the public need not panic
but cautioned: ``Ignoring a situation where such large sums of
money are subjected to few effective outside investigations,
combined with the minor penalties which are often imposed for those
who have misused funds, seems to me to be asking for trouble.''
   The private pension system holds $2 trillion in assets and
covers 76 million Americans. Concern about the plans' well-being
has been heightened by discovery of several multimillion-dollar
pension skimming schemes and financial problems in the government's
pension insurance program, which is $1.5 billion in the red.
   Following the hearing, Hughes said his is asking the General
Accounting Office, the congressional investigator, to look into the
Labor Department's handling of investigations.
   Ball, assistant labor secretary for pension and welfare
benefits, said that despite those problems ``the pension system, by
any objective measure, has never been healthier.''
   In an earlier interview, Hughes expressed skepticism about such
assurances. ``I heard the same sectors saying the savings and loan
situation wasn't serious five years ago,'' he said.
   Maria, an outspoken former FBI agent, stayed away from dramatic
comparisons in his testimony Wednesday, and said ``our goal is not
to unnecessarily frighten people, but to stimulate concern where
such concern is needed, and to avoid potential future crisis.''
   He said inadequate regulations and reliance on civil rather than
criminal remedies have ``created a window of opportunity for those
who would embezzle and steal from plan participants.''
   Maria also used the forum to air inhouse fighting in the Labor
Department which led to a Justice Department opinion in March
barring his office from directly investigating private pension
plans. That job is handled by the department's Pension Benefits
Welfare Administration, which has 300 inspectors to police the
nation's 870,000 private pension programs.
   Over the past five years, more than 25 percent of the plans
audited by the agency had violations of the 1974 Employee
Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA. But the PWBA on a
yearly average investigates less than 1 percent of the nation's
pension plans.
   The inspector general's office wants the law changed to require
private accountants who audit pension programs to report any
violations to the Labor Department. It also says the Labor
Department should pursue more criminal cases against violators,
rather than relying largely on civil suits.
   Ball responded that the department's enforcement policy is
designed to deliver ``the biggest bang for the buck and affecting
the most participants possible.''
   He said the Labor Department concentrates on plans covering more
than 100 employees and targets its investigations ``on plans which
we believe have a high chance of violating the law.''
   Maria's office, in a report released to the House subcommittee,
said billions of dollars in private pension money is not being
fully audited because the money was invested in such institutions
as savings and loans. The assumption was that money in federal
institutions was subject to other examinations.
   The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, in a
statement received Wednesday, agreed with the inspector general's
office, saying: ``Congress should change these regulations to give
auditors a fighting chance to do a thorough job.''
   In an earlier study, Maria's office reported that $18.7 million
in missed plan assets and administrative violations were found in
plans examined in late 1987.

<HEAD>United: Pilots Must Continue to Fly Planes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines says its pilots union is bound by
federal law to fly two new jumbo jets, but the pilots say that
unless they have a new contract by a Nov. 22 deadline, those planes
will be grounded.
   Lawyers for the company have told the Air Line Pilots
Association that its members at United must continue to fly two new
Boeing 747-400s, ALPA spokeswoman Kathie Hardin said.
   Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United's parent UAL Corp., declined
comment on the issue.
   The planes, purchased last summer, fly from Los Angeles to the
Australian cities of Sydney and Melbourne. Within the next few
months, United plans to acquire a third 747-400 for its San
Francisco-Hong Kong route.
   The United pilots originally refused to fly the planes in a
dispute over the size of cockpit crews.
   They later reversed their position as part of concessions
granted during negotiations for a pilot-management buyout of UAL,
and also agreed to fly four extra hours a month without pay.
   But after the pilot-management group failed to get financing for
its $6.75 billion buyout proposal on Oct. 13, the pilots threatened
to ground the planes on Nov. 22 unless there is sufficient progress
toward a revised employee-led buyout, or toward a contract
settlement.
   The United pilots have been working without a contract since
April 1988.
   ALPA's executive board is scheduled to discuss UAL's position on
the new jetliners Thursday and Friday, as well as a contract
proposal submitted by the company on Monday, Ms. Hardin said.
   ALPA rejected as ``a piece of trash'' a UAL proposal offered
last week _ the first since the buyout effort collapsed.
   Grounding one of those new planes for a year could reduce
United's revenue by about $50 million, industry experts say.
   UAL contends that ALPA, which represents the 7,000 United
pilots, would violate the federal Railway Labor Act by refusing to
fly the planes, Ms. Hardin said in a telephone interview.
   ``United's taking the position that although it chose not to
argue the point last summer, our not flying the 747-400s is
illegal,'' she said.
   ``We say that there's no language in our existing contract for
747-400 flying.''
   Ms. Hardin said she did not know what provision in the federal
law would be applicable to the pilots union.
   An official at the National Mediation Board in Washington, D.C.,
said the law _ used in negotiating airline industry contracts _
generally requires pilots to abide by terms of their contracts,
which commonly specify the types of planes they will fly.
   UAL might argue that the 747-400 is a derivative of an existing
plane that is covered in the pilots' contract, said the official,
who asked that he not be identified by name.
   But he said the airline would have to go to court to determine
whether the law's provisions apply to the new planes.
   Such an action would be sure to damage the improved relationship
between UAL management and pilots that resulted from participation
in the failed buyout bid.

<HEAD>Japonica Planning To Review Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc., which had
indicated it would not seriously consider a takeover bid from
Japonica Partners, has decided to let the New York investment group
review its confidential records, a Japonica spokesman said.
   ``We're pleased that the board is now apparently cooperating,
and are looking forward to completing a transaction that is in the
best interests of creditors and shareholders,'' said the spokesman,
Fredric Spar.
   Edward M. Romanoff, an Allegheny International spokesman,
Wednesday declined to comment on Spar's comments.
   Last week, company attorney Bruce McCullough said in a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court hearing that the board ``probably won't spend much
time'' considering the $683.8 million buyout bid by Japonica.
   The consumer products company, which a year ago actively sought
buyers, recently has maintained it is not for sale.
   Japonica has said it might increase its bid to $700 million or
more if it received additional information from the company.
   Allegheny's board has designated two non-executive directors,
Thomas Maddux and Richard Farkas, to act as liaisons to Japonica,
Spar said.
   Allegheny International, the manufacturer of Sunbeam and Oster
appliances, has spent nearly two years trying to reorganize under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws.

<HEAD>Dresser Industries Offers to Buy Smith International in $568 Million
Deal</HEAD>

   Dresser Industries Inc., an oil services company,
said Wednesday it has offered to purchase Smith International Inc.,
a manufacturer of oil and gas drilling equipment, in a deal valued
at $567 million.
   Dresser said the acquisition would broaden its base and prepare
the company for resurgence in the petroleum business.
   ``This is a recognition that the bust is behind us and we're
going to move,'' said Dresser spokesman Herb Ryan.
   Dresser has offered $14.25 in cash plus a warrant for each of
Smith's 32.4 million shares, or about $462 million.
   In addition, Ryan said Dresser would assume about $106 million
in SMith's debt, boosting the total value of the deal to about $568
million.
   The board of directors of Houston-based Smith International has
approved the merger. Dresser's board will consider the merger
Thursday.
   The deal is contingent upon approval by a majority of Smith
stockholders and clearance by the Federal Trade Commission.
   Dresser also can terminate the agreement by Friday if fails to
reach agreement with Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., the
company's largest shareholder with 33.2 percent of Smith's
outstanding common stock.
   Industrial Equity, controlled by New Zealand financier Ronald
Brierley, put the company in play this summer when it made a bid to
buy the stock it did not own.
   Smith spokeswoman Vivian Cline said Industrial Equity had been
involved in the negotiations with Dresser and is expected to
approve the merger.
   Smith, which moved its headquarters to Houston earlier this
year, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 31,
1987.
   The company had filed for bankruptcy after Baker Hughes Inc. won
a $214 million patent infringement suit surrounding the oil drill
bit designed by Howard Hughes' father that opened up the petroleum
industry.
   Dresser, based in Dallas, has become a supplier mainly to the
refining and marketing end of the energy business, Ryan said.
   The Smith purchase would take advantage of the rejuvenating
exploration business, especially for natural gas, Ryan said.
   In Dresser's latest fiscal year, the company earned $145.5
million on sales of $3.94 billion.
   Smith has continued to post losses since emerging from
bankruptcy. For the first nine months of this year, the company
lost $2.05 million, or 12 cents per share, on sales of $223.7
million.
   Last year, Smith's losses were $23.38 million, or 86 cents per
share, on sales of $320.8 million.

   Roger Rosenblatt, who resigned last month as
editor of the newsweekly U.S. News &amp; World Report, has joined Life
magazine as editor at large, it was announced Wednesday.
   James R. Gaines, Life's managing editor, said Rosenblatt will
write a monthly column as well as do feature stories for the
magazine in the newly created post.
   Rosenblatt spent eight years at Time magazine starting in 1980
as an essayist and senior writer.
   He left Time in May 1988 to join U.S. News as a senior writer,
and was appointed editor in August 1988.
   Both Time and Life are publications of Time Warner Inc.
   ``We are delighted that Roger is joining Life's staff,'' Gaines
said in a statement. ``He is a gifted writer and superb editor, and
it will be wonderful to have his considerable talent and energy in
the magazine.''
   Rosenblatt was director of education at the National Endowment
for the Humanities from 1973-75, became literary editor for the New
Republic in 1975 and worked as a columnist for The Washington Post.
   He has written three books: ``Black Fiction,'' ``Children of
War'' and Witness: The World Since Hiroshima.''

<HEAD>Lengthy Strike Could Hurt Economy, Federal Reserve Bank Warns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drawn-out machinists strike against Boeing Co.
could hurt the U.S. economy, since Boeing is the nation's
third-largest exporter, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
says.
   The strike enters its 44th day Thursday. Federal mediator Doug
Hammond said no new negotiations were scheduled.
   In the November issue of its newsletter The Western Economy, the
bank said the Boeing strike is starting to affect the Seattle-area
economy, with suppliers seeing some reductions in orders.
   ``Personal income is estimated to have fallen by $25 to $30
million during each week of the strike, and weekly income losses
are expected to grow as the strike continues,'' it said.
   Boeing ships nearly $1 billion in goods overseas each month, the
newsletter said. With fewer deliveries, ``the stoppage could show
up in worse U.S. trade figures for the duration of the strike and
beyond,'' it said.
   On Wednesday, the government cited the Boeing strike and the San
Francisco earthquake as two reasons why industrial production fell
0.7 percent in October to its lowest level in 3{ years. The Federal
Reserve Board said its industrial production index in October stood
at 141.4 percent of its 1977 base, down from 142.4 percent a month
earlier.
   Boeing has a backlog of 1,718 airplanes, worth an estimated $85
billion, with deliveries of some aircraft booked well into the late
1990s.
   Since the strike began, Boeing has delivered 21 jets. When the
strike began, Boeing had planned to deliver about 93 more planes by
the end of the year.
   Boeing spokesman Lee Lathrop said production is continuing ``to
the best of our ability and available resources.''
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, which represents 57,800 Boeing production workers
nationwide, went on strike Oct. 4, the day after members rejected a
three-year contract offer. Union negotiators later turned down a
revised offer, calling it a worse deal than the earlier proposal.

   Investor T. Boone Pickens expanded his attack on
Japanese business practices Wednesday, accusing Toyota Motor Co. of
``coercive and anti-competitive practices.''
   Pickens based his complaints on reports Toyota is threatening to
reduce its relationship with Koito Manufacturing Co. if Boone Co.,
Pickens' investment company, succeeds in gaining seats on Koito's
board.
   ``I see these reports as direct threats against Koito that
blatantly expose Toyota's coercive and anti-competitive
practices,'' Pickens said.
   Toyota is Koito's largest customer for automobile lighting parts.
   ``Toyota has something to hide,'' Pickens said in a statement.
``They don't want me or any outsider looking over their control and
influence of Koito.''
   Hajime Sakaguchi, a Toyota spokesman in Tokyo, denied that
Toyota plans to reduce its relationship with Koito. He said
Thursday he did not know which reports Pickens referred to since he
had not seen any reports concerning Toyota and Koito in major
Japanese newspapers and U.S. newspapers he checked recently.
   ``Our company's position on the issue remains unchanged: The
Koito issue is one between Koito and Mr. Pickens. We are not in a
position to make any comment,'' Sakaguchi said.
   Pickens is the largest shareholder in Koito, with 26 percent of
the outstanding common stock, but has been thwarted in his attempts
to gain seats on the board of directors.
   Pickens claims Toyota, which owns 19 percent of Koito, has three
of Koito's 20 board members. Toyota and Koito deny the three men
are Toyota representatives, but are former Toyota employees.
   Koito claims Pickens is engaging in greenmail, the practice of
buying a large stake of a company's stock and forcing the company
to buy it back at a steep premium.
   Pickens has used such tactics in the past in runs on such U.S.
firms as Phillips Petroleum Co. and Gulf Oil Corp.
   The Texas oilman and investor has attempted to enlist the U.S.
government in his battle with Koito, testifying before
congressional committees and persuading 15 U.S. senators to ask
Trade Representative Carla Hills to include the dispute in ongoing
talks with the Japanese.
   ``Americans have to have the right to invest and share in the
management of Japanese companies if the Japanese are going to do
the same in the United States,'' Pickens said.
