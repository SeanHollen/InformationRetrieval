   In some versions of an Associated
Press story July 19, which cited a published report, it was
erroneously reported that a federal drug task force operating under
drug czar William Bennett's office started an investigation into
lawyer Thomas Root's activities two days before his plane ditched
in Bahamian waters.
   Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Mario Perez says the
task force operates under the auspices of the DEA, not of Bennett's
office. He said Virginia police, part of the task force, had passed
along information to the DEA about a search of Root's airline
hangar that they said found guns and a can of ether, but the task
force had not initiated a formal investigation.

   A 25-year-old man tied the knot and
then found himself in handcuffs when police arrested him for murder
moments after he recited his vows.
   The Philippines Journal reported Thursday that five policemen on
Sunday went to the town of Caoayan, 200 miles north of Manila, in
search of Amante Belen, a former security guard sought in the April
slaying of a factory engineer.
   When police arrived, they learned Belen was getting married that
day, the paper said. The police went to the local church and found
the ceremony in progress.
   Police waited patiently until the service was over. After the
priest pronounced the couple husband and wife, police Sgt. Reynaldo
Enrico walked down the aisle and handcuffed the groom, the paper
said.
   Enrico apologized to the guests, then hauled the groom away, the
paper said.

<TEXT>
   An Italian count who spent a lifetime collecting
toy trains and ships put his tiny treasures on the auction block
and wound up with nearly $2 million.
   Collectors worldwide flocked to London on Thursday for the sale
of Count Antonio Giansanti Coluzzi's models. Christie's auction
house said it was the largest and finest selection of its kind.
   The all-day auction made a total of $1,954,246.
   The top-priced lot was $53,460 paid by an unidentified New
Yorker for a 1909 model of a German ocean liner, made by the firm
of Marklin. The model runs in water for seven hours on two 4-volt
batteries.
   Now 74, the count began collecting in 1923. Coluzzi, who lives
in Switzerland, did not attend the auction.
   He said he was selling 95 percent of the trains and toy ships
from his villa in Lausanne beause his daughter and grandsons were
not interested in them.
   Most of the 3,000 items could have been bought until the 1960s
for a few dollars. Now they are considered works of art.

   The pilot of United Airlines Flight 232
said he had almost no control over his DC-10 in the final 34
minutes before the jumbo jet's fiery crash, the National
Transportation Safety Board said Thursday.
   NTSB officials revealed a host of problems that plagued the
ill-fated aircraft, including the loss of fluid in the plane's
hydraulic system and holes in the tail's horizontal stablizer.
   At least 76 people were killed, and up to 43 others were missing
and believed dead in Wednesday'sspectacular crash.
   Rescuers said many of those unaccounted for probably were
trapped in a large silver- and red-striped section of the charred
fuselage that sat amid rows of corn 4 feet tall.
   The DC-10's hydraulic system, which allow pilots to manipulate
wing and tail controls, contained no fluid as Capt. Al C. Haynes
tried to bring the plane into Sioux Gateway Airport, NTSB board
member Jim Burnett told a news conference Thursday night.
   Haynes notified Federal Aviation Administration air traffic
controllers in Minneapolis at 3:24 p.m. CDT that he had almost no
control over the aircraft, Burnett said.
   ``The aircraft could only be turned to the right,'' he said.
``They made three 360-degree turns.'' The plane crashed at 3:58 p.m.
   The entire fan-rotor system for one engine was missing, Burnett
told a nighttime news conference. ``That's the first time for this
type of engine that we've ever seen.''
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said there was a
10-inch-by-12-inch hole and three or four smaller ones in the
horizontal stabilizer, the small, horizontal wing on the tail
section. The rear engine sits just above the stabilizer.
   Lopatkiewicz said the holes were ``projectile penetrations,''
but declined to be more specific. Such holes in the horizontal
stabilizer could be caused by pieces of metal spewed like shrapnel
from a disintegrating engine.
   NTSB officials refused to answer questions about how any of the
damage or failure of the hydraulic system would have contributed to
the accident.
   Officials gave conflicting reports Thursday on the number of
survivors and the number of people aboard the aircraft, with the
number of survivors ranging from 174 to 197.
   United later scaled back the high figure to 183, explaining that
the flight crew had been mistakenly counted twice and that two
people counted as survivors were now missing.
   United and other officials said earlier there were 293 people
aboard the DC-10, but Burnett said Thursday night there were 295
people on the aircraft. He said there were four people in the
cockpit instead of three, including an off-duty pilot. Asked about
Burnett's report, United stuck by its figure of 293.
   Earlier Thursday, rescuers and survivors spoke of miracles, and
investigators swept ``inch by inch'' through a cornfield in the
search for the crash's cause.
   Some survivors just walked away from the wreckage.
   Beginning at daybreak, National Guardsman began collecting
pieces of wreckage and carrying body bags to ambulances and
refrigerated trailers.
   The plane, crippled by the loss of hydraulic power, pitched
violently to its right just a few feet from the ground, scraped its
right wing, cartwheeled into a ball of fire and broke into pieces
during an emergency landing about 4 p.m. on a closed runway at the
Sioux Gateway Airport.
   Survivor Garry Priest, 23, of Northglenn, Colo., said those who
got out of the plane saw what ``looked like a war zone. Bodies,
trash, magazines, luggage, and pieces of bodies littered the area.
It was the worst thing I've ever seen.''
   ``We could not believe anybody could walk away from it,'' said
Dr. David Greco, director of emergency services for the Marian
Health Center and one of the first physicians on the scene.
   Greco lauded the passengers and crew for maintaining calm and
said the nature of the breakup of the plane largely determined the
pattern of deaths and injuries.
   The three members of the cockpit crew survived the crash, but
Greco said the first-class section was devastated. Passengers in
rows nine through 19 suffered no injuries or minor ones, he added,
but ``there was nothing left of the rear half of the aircraft.''
   ``One section was thrown so far so fast that it never got
involved in the fire,'' he said.
   Tales of heroism abounded, beginning with praise for Haynes, a
33-year United veteran.
   Gov. Terry Branstad visited Haynes' bedside and said at a news
conference: ``He was quite emotional about the situation and tears
came to his eyes when he talked about the number of people who lost
their lives. ... I told him he did a valiant job.''
   In Washington, President Bush extended his sympathy Thursday to
victims' families and friends and praised the ``extraordinary
efforts'' of rescuers at the crash site.
   Flight 232, from Denver to Philadelphia via Chicago, carried 11
crew members and 282 passengers, including three infants, United
spokesman Lawrence Nagin said earlier Thursday. The plane has a
capacity of 287 passengers.
   Rachel Halterman, spokeswoman from the National Transportation
Safety Board, said agency investigators met with emergency medical
teams from the city, county and state, and representatives of the
airline, the plane's manufacturer and the pilots union to maximize
the search for victims and clues from the crash.
   ``Even the investigators can't say why so many people
survived,'' she said, ``and there hasn't been time for
speculation.''
   The search of the crash site, roughly the length of three
football fields, ``will be an inch-by-inch thing,'' Ms. Halterman
said from the NTSB's makeshift command center in the Sioux City
Convention Center.
   ``The flight recorder will be going back to Washington sometime
today and we'll start interviewing the crew and the survivors,
eyewitnesses and everybody we can who has firsthand knowledge of
the accident,'' she said. ``We're also collecting maintenance
records on the plane.''
   Two flight recorders, which were not damaged in the crash, were
opened later in Washington.
   The flight voice recorder has the final 30 minutes of
conversation from the DC-10's cockpit and the data recorder
contains several hours of information about the plane _ its speed,
compass heading and other data recorded every few seconds.
   The recorder and tapes were in good condition, said NTSB
aeronautical engineer Thomas Jacky. Their contents are not likely
to be made public for several weeks.
   Before the crash, the pilot radioed to report that the
15-year-old jumbo jet experienced ``complete hydraulic failure,''
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar said. Parts
of the plane were found 50 miles away.
   The tail engine failed, which may have caused hydraulic failure,
said Bob Raynesford, another FAA spokesman. The plane's three
independent hydraulic systems are routed to the tail section.
   Since the plane was not in one piece, Burnett said,
investigators could not say with certainty that the damaged engine
was the one that the pilot had reported trouble with.
   A modern jet engine works with a propellor-like fan encased in
the engine housing. The fan, revolving at thousands of revolutions
per minute, draws in cold air to circulate around the combustion
chamber and mix with hot exhaust gases in the rear of the engine
for more use of fuel and a quieter engine.
   Inside the combustion chamber is a turbine, which also has
blades. These blades are subject to far higher stresses and it is
not uncommon for them to break.
   The crash left a swath of charred runway and scattered bits of
people's lives over the wide expanse: two sets of golf clubs, a
wallet photo of a brunette in her prom dress, a Reebok tennis shoe,
a purple hairdryer, one black high-heeled shoe and a collection of
Marilyn Monroe photographs.
   Four people near Alta, 55 miles east of Sioux City, discovered a
piece of the plane, 6 to 7 feet high and 6 feet long, in a
cornfield.
   Virginia Jane Murray, a flight attendant, survived by crawling
out of an opening in the burning wreckage.
   ``She said she was tumbling,'' said her father, Don Murray of
Chester, S.C. ``The walls were coming in. She said a hole opened up
and the sunlight came in and she climbed out the hole. She said she
knew the Lord opened up that hole.''
   Nine-year-old Yisroel Brownstein suffered a broken arm and
bruises, but his parents, who flew from Denver to Sioux City,
regarded the injuries almost joyously. ``I feel like he was born
all over again today,'' said his father, Avrohom.
   ``He wanted a broken arm like his friends,'' he said. ``Now he's
got one.''
   Survivor Mark Michaelson of Denver said that during the last 30
minutes of the flight, attendants drilled passengers on emergency
procedures and told them to put their heads between their knees.
   Many survivors reported that the passengers were mostly calm as
they prepared themselves for what they expected would be an
extremely rough landing.
   City Manager Hank Sinda put the number of survivors at 174 _
which, with his count of 76 confirmed dead, would put the number
unaccounted for at 43.
   United's count of the number of people who survived the crash
fluctuated widely Thursday. By late evening, the carrier scaled
back its estimate of 185 survivors to 183, saying two people
reported earlier as survivors were now unaccounted-for.
   At one point, airline spokesman Russell Mack put the number as
high as 197. He later explained that the figure of 197 was a
mistake. He said he had been told the number had risen to 187 and
including only passengers, and that he added the flight crew to
that figure.

   The crash of a United wide-bodied jet in Sioux
City, Iowa, demonstrates a problem already highlighted in two other
major DC-10 accidents: loss of pilot control with damage to flight
control systems.
   Other incidents prior to Wednesday's DC-10 crash, in which 119
people were either dead or missing, have a common thread in the
loss of pilot control after a failure that would not ordinarily
affect flight controls, such as loss of an engine or a cargo door.
   Some of the cases did not cause heavy loss of life, but each has
added to concern among government and aviation authorities over
design of the DC-10 which the government grounded for more than a
month in 1979.
   A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said Thursday the
out-of-production DC-10 is ``as fit as any other'' airliner and has
flown 745 million passengers safely more than 7 billion miles.
   Douglas officials declined to comment on evidence that the
plane's hydraulic systems failed in the Sioux City crash, except to
say that the manufacturer was cooperating in the federal
investigation to determine cause.
   But spokesman Don Hanson said DC-10s have three independent
hydraulic systems routed through the aircraft so they are as far
apart from each other as possible.
   ``The airplane is so designed that the loss of any one hydraulic
system will not affect control of the airplane,'' Hanson said. Even
if two systems failed, a pilot still should be able to land safely,
he said, and the system has an additional air-driven backup for one
of the systems.
   Although investigators were looking at explosive failure of the
plane's tail engine as the initial incident in the crash of United
Flight 232 in Sioux City, they also were concerned about apparent
collapse of the plane's hydraulic systems as its pilot was
attempting an emergency landing on a Denver-Philadelphia flight.
   The hydraulic systems link the pilot with wing flaps, tail
elevators, rudders, brakes, and other devices that guide the
airliner in takeoff, during flight, in landing and on the runway.
   Federal Aviation Administration authorities said the DC-10's
pilot first reported ``uncontained engine failure,'' which means
parts shot out of the engine, possibly damaging other systems and
causing what the pilot later described as ``complete hydraulic
failure.''
   In 1974, loss of a cargo door caused decompression in a Turkish
Airlines DC-10 over France. The plane's floor buckled, snapping
control cables, and the airliner went out of control, killing 346
people. At least two previous incidents had pointed to a cargo door
problem, but the problem was not ordered corrected by the FAA until
after the Turkish crash.
   On May 25, 1979, in Chicago, the engine of an American Airlines
DC-10 broke loose and catapulted over the wing during takeoff,
breaking hydraulic cables and causing a crash that killed 275
people. Investigators blamed faulty maintenance but also
recommended a design review.
   McDonnell Douglas spokesman David Eastman said he knew of only
one design change that had occurred in the DC-10 since the Chicago
crash, involving instrumentation that would warn the pilot when
wing slats were improperly positioned.
   The two incidents and the latest crash point to serious problems
with design of the DC-10, said John Galipault of the Aviation
Safety Institute, a nonprofit group that pushes for safer planes.
   He said the common element in several DC-10 crashes has been
loss of the pilot's ability to control the aircraft after a
catastrophic failure in a single system.
   ``When that happens, the pilot becomes a passenger,'' he said.
``It reinforces my concern about the airplane. It's too bad, but it
has a terrible safety record.''
   According to a National Transportation Safety Board analysis of
the Chicago crash, the DC-10 has three hydraulic systems, each
powered by two engine-driven pumps. It also has two electric
auxiliary pumps. Further backup is provided by an air-driven system
which includes a propeller dependent only upon movement of the
aircraft through the air.
   Problems with the pumps' design was found early in the
19-year-old history of the DC-10 and corrected, the board said.
   But as accidents occurred, controversy over effectiveness of the
DC-10's hydraulic system and its backups increased.
   In 1982, McDonnell Douglas discussed possible design changes
after an Air Florida DC-10 in Miami aborted its takeoff without
injuries after a malfunctioning engine hurled fan blades into the
wing and caused hydraulic problems.
   In July 1974, failure in a wing engine on a DC-10 en route from
Miami to Los Angeles caused loss of hydraulic fluid because of
damage to the wing.
   After a March 1976 accident in which a flock of birds flew into
a DC-10 rear engine, causing it to disintegrate, the safety board
concluded that the engine could not safely tolerate such a massive
ingestion of foreign objects.
   Airliners can fly with one engine out, but there is concern with
the DC-10 that failure of any engine which involves it coming apart
endangers the hydraulic system.
   Other wide-bodied jets, such as the Boeing 747, have differently
configured hydraulic and engine systems, also with built-in
redundant backups. A Boeing spokesman, David Jimenez, declined to
discuss any differences between the aircrafts, saying it would be
``like comparing apples and oranges.''

<TEXT>
   Nothing _ not a soup spill, a burned filet
mignon or a cockroach crawling through the salad _ turns a
restaurant meal into a disaster quite like a nasty headwaiter, says
professional diner John Campbell.
   His advice: Don't take it sitting down. Complain to the manager.
Or simply walk out.
   ``The degree of humiliation to which a repulsive maitre d'
subjects his patrons and their guests can be the most unforgettable
part of the dining experience,'' says Campbell. ``Unfortunately, it
happens in some of our better restaurants.''
   Campbell has been rating lodgings and restaurants for the
American Automobile Association for the past 15 years. He says
restaurants in New York doubtless are the worst for sneering,
snarling headwaiters whose unlucky customers forgot to slip them a
sawbuck.
   The bearded, Australian-born Campbell, 52, says the hapless
victims of sadistic headwaiters ``can just get up and leave'' if
they've been seated next to the kitchen door, insulted and
forgotten.
   ``You don't have to eat bad food, and you don't have to be stuck
suffering this self-punishment,'' he said in an interview.
   When the atmosphere turns brutish, Campbell takes the offending
headwaiter aside and asks, ``What seems to be going wrong here?
What is my problem and what is your problem?''
   If the situation can't be resolved through quiet reasoning, he
says, ``I would leave.'' But don't forget to complain to the
restaurant's owner or manager.
   ``He has a desperate interest in the health of his property, and
he will listen,'' Campbell said. ``If you tell him you had an
unpleasant experience with Monsieur Jacques, he's likely to say,
`Really?' and Monsieur Jacques might not be there next time.''
   Campbell, who is based in New York, is one of 60 full-time,
professionally trained field representatives who are rating
restaurants for AAA, the 30-million-member motoring and travel
service organization based in suburban Falls Church, Va.
   At a news conference Thursday, AAA officials announced they are
going nationwide with their ``diamond'' rating service, which
awards five diamonds for the highest-ranked luxury restaurants to a
single diamond for informal, family-style eateries serving ``good
but unpretentious dishes.''
   No fewer than 72 rating guidelines, developed with the help of
Cornell University's School of Hotel Management, will be applied to
nearly 7,000 restaurants annually in the United States, Canada,
Mexico and the Caribbean for inclusion in AAA's 1990 tour books.
   Officials said that means Campbell and his colleagues will eat
an average of 10 to 12 meals in different restaurants every week.
Each will be scored on everything from parking lots to table
flowers, from the taste of the hors d'oeuvres to how discreetly the
waiter delivers the bill.
   ``It is one of the most onerous jobs in the world, dining out
for a living,'' said Thomas R. Crosby, the AAA's managing director
for national travel.
   Campbell, interviewed over lunch at a five-diamond French
restaurant in downtown Washington, agrees that all that eating and
drinking can be a health hazard. When time came for dessert, he
passed up the chocolate mousse for a dish of strawberries.
   Some of his fellow judges have quit because of gustatory
burnout, he says, and one turned into an alcoholic after eight
years on the restaurant circuit.
   ``You can drink so much and eat so much good food _ and bad food
_ that you become poisoned, and your health starts to
deteriorate,'' Campbell said.
   ``You have to jog a lot and swim a lot. You have to be picky.
You learn to stop eating after one bite. You don't have to clean
your plate, no matter what your mother said about all those
starving children in China.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Did Anybody Tell Baker About the OAS Meeting?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Organization of American States foreign
ministers were scouting around last month for a date to meet in
Washington, they settled on July 19, partly because Secretary of
State James A. Baker III would be in town.
   But when the delegates convened here Wednesday to talk about the
Panama situation, Baker was occupied by other matters and stayed
away.
   Other foreign ministers from the hemisphere had traveled up to
6,000 miles to attend the meeting, but Baker didn't make the
five-block trip over to OAS headquarters from the State Department.
   The story was much the same in June. Ministers from around the
hemisphere turned up in Washington for a meeting on Panama, but
Baker had other issues on his agenda and sent subordinates over to
the OAS.
   This does not go unnoticed by other governments, which have the
clear impression Baker is much more oriented toward Europe and Asia
than he is toward Latin America.
   Indeed, just two weeks before Baker was a no-show at OAS
headquarters on Wednesday, he had traveled halfway around the world
to attend a meeting of the six-member Association of Southeast
Asian Nations in Brunei. The OAS has 31 members.
   Shortly after taking office in January, he took off on a visit
to each of the European members of NATO and has been back to Europe
several times since then.
   Baker's aides acknowledge he may be gravitating toward Europe
and Asia because the economic and political changes there are
generally favorable to the United States, especially in contrast to
Latin America, where the outlook is far bleaker.
   While the democratic trend in Latin America is a source of
encouragement to U.S. officials, the economic situation in many
countries is disastrous and the problem of coping with drug flows
from south of the border seems insurmountable.
   Beyond that, as this week's OAS meeting on Panama demonstrated
once again, Americans and Latin Americans just don't see things the
same way.
   A comparison between that meeting and an OAS meeting on Cuba 25
years ago this week offers convincing evidence of just how far U.S.
influence in the hemisphere has declined over the past generation.
   Prodded by the Johnson administration a quarter-century ago, the
OAS imposed mandatory economic and diplomatic sanctions against
Cuba after concluding that Cuba was responsible for fomenting
subversion in Venezuela.
   Those were the days when anti-communist military dictators
dominated Latin American political life; they were only too willing
to lend strategic support to Washington's Cold War ventures.
   Nowadays, democracy is ascendant in the hemisphere, and the
anti-communist consensus has long since unraveled. The Reagan
administration looked high and low for Latin American support for
the Nicaraguan Contras but almost always came up empty-handed.
   The Bush administration is somewhat isolated on what to do about
the situation in Panama. Gen. Manuel Noriega is not a popular
figure in the hemisphere but only Washington seems to have any
appetite for confronting him.
   The disappointment among U.S. officials was palpable Wednesday
night when the best the OAS could do on Panama was a declaration
which _ although it calls for a transfer of power in Panama _ was
so bland and ambiguous that even Noriega's representative didn't
oppose it.
   That is not the only issue on which the Bush administration has
been isolated politically from its hemispheric neighbors.
   In contrast to the situation 25 years ago when Cuba was
virtually friendless in the hemisphere, President Fidel Castro now
enjoys widespread acceptance. One exception is Washington.
   In less than a year, Castro has attended presidential inaugurals
in Ecuador, Venezuela and Mexico. Much to Washington's chagrin, the
United Nations has selected Cuba as the site for a conference on
crime next year.
   Baker has not ignored hemispheric affairs completely; one early
achievement was the bipartisan agreement he reached with Congress
governing future policy toward Central America.
   In time, he may find hemispheric issues more appealing. One test
will come on Aug. 23, the date of the next OAS foreign ministers'
meeting on Panama.

   Princess Beatrice took her first faltering steps
in public while her parents, the Duke and Duchess of York, were
thousands of miles away in Canada.
   The flame-haired princess, who celebrates her first birthday

   It wasn't kryptonite but champagne that
actor Christopher Reeve used to commission his new sailboat.
   Reeve, 36, who starred in the ``Superman'' movies, is an avid
sailor. He first saw a version of his new 46-foot boat at the 1988
Newport International Sailboat Show, but his $500,000 craft was
custom-designed with room in the galley to accomodate two cooks.
The forward galley was enlarged to accommodate Reeve's
6-foot-4-inch frame.
   Reeve named the boat Sea Angel in honor of the ``guardian
angel'' that he says watches over him in his quest for adventure.

   Cosmetics giant Revlon Group Inc. has elected
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to its board of
directors, which includes actress Audrey Hepburn and Ann Getty,
wife of oil heir Gordon P. Getty.
   The cosmetics company announced Thursday that Kissinger will
become the 14th member of the board and will serve an indefinite
term.
   Last month, the privately held company announced that former
first lady Nancy Reagan had become a director.
   Revlon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ronald O. Perelman
said Kissinger's ``unparalleled knowledge of world affairs and
global markets will provide an invaluable perspective to our
board's oversight of Revlon's growing international operations.''
   Kissinger, who was secretary of state from 1973 to 1975 and won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973, already serves on the boards of
American Express Co., Union Pacific Corp., and R.J. Macy &amp; Co.,
among others.

   Brian Baldinger, an offensive lineman for
the Indianapolis Colts football team, has been released on $350
bail after pleading innocent to charges that he jumped up and down
on a woman's car.
   Baldinger, 30, entered the plea to charges of leaving the scene
of an accident, harassment and criminal mischief.
   Baldinger was driving a rental car when it was struck from
behind by a car driven by Ann Marie Cullen, 20, on Wednesday.
   Cullen told police that after the collision, the 6-foot-4-inch,
270-pound, Baldinger climbed onto the roof of her 1975 Dodge and
began jumping up and down, demanding to see her license and
registration.
   She said he then got off the roof and ripped her wallet out of
her hand.
   When she asked for it back, he threw it under her car and drove
away.
   She complained to police, who stopped Baldinger a few miles away.
   Baldinger appeared in First District Court in nearby Hempstead
on Thursday.

   Catastrophic health coverage for older
Americans, under heavy attack by some of its beneficiaries, is
facing new challenges from House tax-writers despite a tentative
vote to keep it alive.
   Awaiting action before the Ways and Means Committee is a
proposal to sharply reduce catastrophic coverage of prescription
drugs and use the money to cut the surtax that pays most of the
cost of the program. Also pending is an amendment that would allow
Medicare recipients to accept or reject catastrophic coverage.
   Another hot issue _ whether to cut the tax on capital gains _
remains unresolved. Supporters of the cut claim enough votes for
victory despite the opposition of Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley. President Bush wants a
reduction.
   Aides said Rostenkowski is unlikely to allow a vote until after
he and Foley get a last chance to make their case before the caucus
of all House Democrats next week. The two leaders oppose a cut
because three-quarters of the benefits would go to those with
incomes over $100,000 a year.
   By a 23-13 margin, the committee rejected a motion that would
have put the committee on record for repeal of the year-old program
that helps older Americans bear the expense of catastrophic
illness. Most Democrats voted against repeal and most Republicans
favored repeal. Five from each party voted with the other side.
   Some of the 23 votes against repeal came from those who think
the program should be continued as it is. Others were cast by those
who want to end the program but know that would raise the federal
deficit by about $6 billion next year. That is because the
catastrophic tax is bringing in money faster than benefits are
being paid.
   Although the vote was on a procedural motion, committee aides
said it showed the panel is unlikely to recommend repeal.
   ``I just don't see how you can fix it to the satisfaction of the
beneficiaries,'' said Rep. Brian Donnelly, D-Mass., chief sponsor
of the repeal amendment. ``I don't think the status quo can survive
politically.''
   Catastrophic coverage is financed principally by a 15 percent
surtax on retirees who owe at least $150 in income tax. The maximum
surtax this year is $800 per person eligible for Medicare benefits.
   Those who have to pay that surtax have complained loudly and
demanded that Congress change the financing method so that the
program is funded by taxpayers of all ages.
   The committee is debating catastrophic and capital gains as part
of a bill whose chief aim is to raise $5.3 billion in new revenues
for deficit reduction next year.
   On Thursday, the committee added to the bill provisions
extending eight tax benefits that have expired or will expire at
year's end. With a total cost of $13.5 billion over five years,
they are:
   _Renewing through 1991 a tax exclusion of up to $5,250 a year in
employer-financed education assistance.
   _A two-year extension of the targeted-jobs tax credit, which
goes to employers who hire disadvantaged young adults.
   _A two-year extension of mortgage revenue bonds, which benefit
lower-income families buying their first home.
   _A two-year extension of a tax exemption for small issues of
bonds benefiting manufacturing plants and farmers.
   _Two-year renewal of a special credit for business purchase of
geothermal-energy equipment. The committee voted to end the credit
for solar energy.
   _Permanent extension of a credit for investments in low-income
rental housing.
   _Permanent extension of a credit for increased investment in
research and experimentation.
   _Making permanent a rule giving corporations a tax cut by
allowing them, within limits, to select how to write off research
expenses.

   Chairman Alan Greenspan confirms the Federal
Reserve reversed its yearlong campaign of pushing interest rates
higher, but that doesn't mean the central bank is soft on
inflation, economists say.
   Greenspan said in his twice-a-year report to Congress Thursday
that ``the balance of risks may have shifted somewhat away from
greater inflation'' and ``what we seek to avoid is an unnecessary
and destructive recession.''
   But, in the same breath, Greenspan told the House Banking
subcommittee on domestic monetary policy, ``inflation remains high
_ clearly above our objective.''
   Private economists are interpreting his remarks as a signal that
the central bank, which controls the nation's money supply and thus
the direction of its economy, will continue cautiously nudging
interest rates lower.
   ``The tilt in policy will be toward ease, but his easing moves
will come later rather than sooner and they will continue to be
small moves,'' said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp;
Co., a government securities dealer in New York.
   Greenspan would not respond directly when asked by panel members
whether interest rates would continue to decline, but he indicated
he did not foresee another shift in policy soon.
   ``It is not desirable to do too many wiggles,'' he said.
   He confirmed the Fed loosened its grip on credit twice _ once in
early June and again early in July _ and that the effects of lower
interest rates are just now beginning to be felt.
   Greenspan said the Fed was gratified by the government's two
most recent inflation reports, for June, showing a modest 0.2
percent rise in the Consumer Price Index and a 0.1 percent decline
in wholesale prices.
   But, he cautioned, ``It's clearly premature, with one month's
data, to suggest that inflation pressures are behind us. Certainly
they are not.''
   Fed policymakers are ``not quite sure that inflation is as dead
as it looks now. As long as they're not, they're going to move as
slowly as they can get away with,'' said economist David Wyss of
Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   Meanwhile, Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic
adviser, praised the Fed's recent action to lower interest rates,
but declined to say what he thought the central bank's next move
should be.
   ``I don't like to preach to the Fed in public,'' he told the
Joint Economic Committee.
   Greenspan also released a revised economic forecast which showed
the central bank still hopes to achieve a so-called soft landing in
which growth will slow enough to cool inflationary pressures but
not decline so much that the country is thrown into a recession.
   The Fed predicted modest economic growth, as measured by the
gross national product, of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent this
year, slowing to 1.5 percent to 2 percent in 1990. That compares
with the Bush administration's more optimistic projection of 2.7
percent in 1989 and 2.6 percent in 1990.
   The Congressional Budget Office on Thursday forecast a 2.4
percent rate of growth this year, slowing to 2 percent in 1990.
   The central bank forecast that consumer prices would rise by
between 5 percent and 5.5 percent this year, up from last year's
4.4 percent increase, and slowing to between 4.5 percent and 5
percent in 1990.
   The administration, meanwhile, is looking for a 5 percent rise
in consumer prices this year and 4.1 percent next year. The CBO is
looking for inflation a half point higher than the administration,
in the upper range of the Fed's 1989 projection.

   Now that President Bush has endorsed ``a
journey into tomorrow'' _ a tomorrow that includes people living
and working on the moon and Mars _ Congress will first have to give
NASA a space haven closer to home.
   It's called Space Station Freedom, an orbiting laboratory, that
was to have become a reality in 1992 but will be lucky to be built
in time to greet the 21st century.
   Only a few hours after Bush spoke Thursday, the station survived
another financial cliffhanger in the House of Representatives, one
of a long series.
   When President Ronald Reagan proposed the station in 1984, the
cost for that single component of a moon-Mars future was estimated
to be $8 billion. Today's guess is $30 billion and some experts say
even that won't come close.
   Returning to the moon and going on from there to Mars would cost
untold billions more and would require a buildup of NASA engineers
and industrial machinery not unlike the Apollo days of the 1960s.
More than 400,000 people worked on the moon program; today, NASA
and its civilian contractors employ fewer than 150,000.
   One of the president's chief aides, Budget Director Richard
Darman, was the only administration official to say what Bush's
vision might cost.
   ``Our current estimates are roughly _ very, very roughly _ that
if you went to Mars by the year 2020 and did so first establishing
a lunar base and then going from the moon, the pricetag over this
30-year period would be on the order of $400 billion,'' he told
reporters. The figure, he said, is in today's dollars, not figuring
in inflation.
   ``I know it seems like a very large number but you have to
remember that it is over a 30-year period,'' Darman said.
``Obviously, it puts the system to the test. It is a question of
how much one cares about the future.''
   Bush, in a speech that commemorated the 20th anniversary of the
first landing on the moon, said pointedly that it is up to Congress
to make the space dreams a reality.
   It is in the Congress, he said, ``where the future of the space
station and our future as a spacefaring nation will be decided.''
   Bush called the space station an essential bridge to the
moon-Mars proposals for the 21st Century.
   Members of Congress criticized Bush's omission of a timetable
and estimated costs but the House readily turned back an attempt by
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to transfer $714 million from next
year's budget for the space station to programs for veterans'
medical care, pollution control and low-income and elderly housing.
   ``If the Schumer amendment had passed, it probably would have
killed the space station,'' said Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., chairman
of the House space subcommittee.
   Nelson, who once rode on the space shuttle and is a strong
advocate of Bush's proposals, said that NASA can't meet those goals
on its present budget level of about $10 billion a year.
   ``It will have to be a $30 billion a year NASA to carry this
out,'' he said. That would represent more than 2 percent of the
national budget _ but still far less than the 4 percent-plus
required to send Apollo to the moon.
   At a White House news conference on Thursday, NASA Administrator
Richard Truly said that even if the money were made available, NASA
today could not do the job.
   ``We have a full plate with space shuttle flights and space
station Freedom,'' he said. ``To take on extra programs, we would
need extra help _ technicians and engineers and facilities. But
NASA has the underlying structure, and given the money, we could
flesh out.''
   NASA would have to tackle the problems of long duration flights
on humans _ but that would be done on the space station. While it
only takes three days to go to the moon 250,000 miles away, a
round-trip journey to Mars at least 35 million miles away would
take a minimum of 14 months.
   The space station, orbiting 250 miles high, would be used as a
facility to deliver, assemble, refuel, maintain, and service lunar
and interplanetary vehicles. The station also would be used to
transfer huge amounts of rocket fuel arriving from Earth and serve
as a way station for crews going to and returning from deep space.
   A nuclear-powered space truck would have to be developed to
shuttle up and down from the moon and Mars to an arriving vehicle.
   Technology is needed to mine and process moon rocks and soil for
the minerals needed to build moon structures and to extract oxygen
needed for breathing and for rocket fuel.
   Before embarking for Mars, robot spacecraft would have to be
sent to the Red Planet to scout potential landing sites.
   ``Why the moon? Why Mars?'' the president asked as he extolled
the accomplishments of 20 years ago. He answered his own question:
   ``Because it is humanity's destiny to strive, to seek, to find.
And because it is America's destiny to lead.''

   Nearly a year after a truce ended eight
years of bloodshed, Iran and Iraq are dealing in vastly different
ways with the prospect of peace and the indelible reminders of war.
   Both are rebuilding the battered cities along their ravaged
border. Both have sent home thousands of soldiers who survived one
of the century's longest conflicts.
   Each remains suspicious of the Aug. 20 cease-fire, keeping
hundreds of thousands of troops at the ready in case the fragile
truce abruptly collapses.
   But despite these similarities, the bitter Persian Gulf rivals
are experiencing strikingly different post-war periods.
   The Iraqis are ridding themselves with visible haste of any
reminders of the war, rebuilding shattered cities more quickly than
Iran, promising political reforms _ which appear more cosmetic than
real _ and reviving their regional ambitions.
   The Iranians, uncertain of their political future, still cling
to memories of a war that killed an estimated 1 million people.
   For them, the war had been a convenient way of cementing the
1979 Islamic revolution. Then Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini abruptly
accepted the cease-fire and, less than a year later, died.
   Today, Tehran still extols the virtues of martyrdom and the
horrendous sacrifices of the war. Its leaders warn their countrymen
almost daily: ``Stay vigilant. Iraq cannot be trusted. We cannot
afford to relax.''
   Every Wednesday, ``the Martyr's Program'' on the state
television network takes viewers into the home of a soldier killed
in the war to praise the virtue of dying for the Islamic revolution.
   Mothers and fathers proudly tell of their sons' ``honorable
death.''
   The brother of 18-year-old Hamid Behzad, killed several years
ago, recounted the young man's brief life in one recent program.
   In the parlor of the family's Tehran home, the camera panned
over a black-and-white portrait of Behzad on the mantle. Beside it
was a photo of Khomeini, in whose name he and thousands of his
generation perished. Authorities give every martyr's family one.
   A narrator somberly read a poem written by Hamid before he left
for the front:
   ``If God grants me martyrdom,
   ``Know that I have gone from this world content.
   ``Know that I have gone to someone to whom all shall go.
   ``Mother: grieve not for this transaction.
   ``What transaction better, than man going to see his God?''
   The television, monitored in Nicosia, shows violent war movies
in which the Iranians are rugged, clean-cut heroes and the Iraqis
are invariably portrayed as sadistic and inept.
   One shown recently was a Ramboesque adventure called ``Behind
Enemy Lines.'' It showed three Iranian commandos parachuting into
Iraq on a sabotage mission and fighting their way home.
   Every night, the television still shows actual war footage with
a soundtrack of patriotic songs.
   In Iraq, authorities are seeking to expunge as many reminders of
the war as they can. The Culture Ministry has ordered its theater
groups to stage comedies and official television has switched from
gloomy war-oriented programs to U.S. sitcoms, Arabic soap operas
and family movies.
   Concrete anti-blast blocks have been removed from all government
buildings and officials ordered to don civilian clothes instead of
the tan uniforms they wore during the war to show solidarity with
the men at the front.
   In Iranian cities, schoolboys parade in the streets in
military-style fatigues, copying teen-age siblings for whom the
camouflaged garb has become revolutionary chic.
   Both governments have to cope with hundreds of thousands of
refugees, widows and orphans.
   In Iran's tightly controlled, male-dominated society, it is hard
for a widow to make a living and bring up a family.
   The government has set a minimum monthly stipend of 45,000 rials
($45 at the unofficial exchange rate), and a maximum of 70,000
rials ($70).
   That is barely enough in Iran's hyper-inflated economy, but it's
helped by subsidized housing and food for families of the war dead.
   Nonethless, the recent arrest of a young war widow for
prostitution, which can carry the death sentence in Iran, caused a
national scandal. The woman declared she would go on selling her
body because it was the only way her family could afford to live.
   Both sides have sought to aid the hundreds of thousands of
disabled veterans.
   Iran provides scholarships and government jobs for those who are
``70 percent disabled.'' Vets also get priority in housing and
medical care, despite severe economic restraints.
   In Baghdad, Iraq's capital, housewife Ammal Abdul Karim said she
has finally told her daughter and two sons that their father was
killed defending the southern port of Basra in early 1987, after
explaining his absence by saying he was ``travelling abroad.''
   She said in an interview that she told her children what
happened to their father ``because they're big enough now to
understand that he was a hero and that they should be proud of
him.''
   Like other Iraqi families who lost men at the front, the
government has given her a car and grants to build their own home.
   ``I'm now the man of the family so I have to do everything.''
she said.

   They still have titles like ``Tender Conquest,''
``Prince of Fire,'' and ``The Lion's Lady,'' but the characters of
romance novels have undergone a subtle transformation, say the
women who create them.
   Heroines, once repressed, virginal and more likely to surrender
to sex than initiate it, are now likely to be more assertive on the
job and in the bedroom.
   Even more alarming, for those who like their women meek and
virtuous and their men rough-and-ready, is the unmistakable
sensitivity creeping into what was once the brooding, dangerous
hero of the past.
   ``The men used to be misogynistic, sadistic types, now they're
sometimes sweet, nice guys who own hardware stores,'' said romance
writer Anne Stuart Ohlrogge, 41, of Greensboro, Vt., who has
published 32 titles in 15 years.
   Exhaustively descriptive sex, taboo in the romance novels of the
1940s and 50s, is said to have peaked in 1986. Predictions for the
1990s hold that such novels will return to gentler feelings and
familial values.
   But traditionalists can take heart, according to some of the
nearly 1,000 romance writers, editors, agents and booksellers who
were gathering in Boston today for the ninth annual Romance Writers
of America national conference.
   Some staples of romance book fare, they say, will never change.
   Couples will always live ``happily ever after,'' said Laura
Parker, 40, of Dallas, who has published 16 books.
   The only concession to more complex times is that ``there are
some loose ends that don't get tied up,'' Ohlrogge said.
   And the love scenes are as likely to contain as many smoldering
looks, heaving bosoms and ripped bodices as before.
   ``Graphic, flaming love sex is always a turn-on and once the
characters start, there's nothing an author can do to stop them,''
said Helen Mittermeyer, 59, of Rochester, N.Y., who sold the first
of her 34 books in 1980.
   Mittermayer said her career flourished during the Reagan era,
although it was a time when ``Reagan stifled everything,'' and work
and careers took precedence over matters of the heart.
   ``I think we have to push against the tide,'' said Mittermayer.
``We're not going to be smothered. There's been this macho, bogus
career attitude. But there's real feeling under all that.''
   Some writers at the convention said they have to ignore politics
and reality to concentrate on creating the kind of characters they
want.
   ``I didn't want to read `Women Who Love Too Much,' '' said
Ohlrogge, referring to a recent self-help book for women. ``I was
afraid it might hurt the way I write.''
   Romance book editors at the convention said the industry has
changed along with its authors and books.
   Hilary Ross, associate executive editor of New American Library,
remembers the years when ``Gothics were big and we had all those
student nurse books. And I can recall when we couldn't write about
Australia or the Middle Ages. Now the Middle Ages are in.''
   Gothics are now ``out'' and heroines are more likely to be
doctors than nurses, Ross said.
   ``Ten years ago, we had heroines who would faint,'' said Ross.
``Now they're much more feisty.''

<HEAD>Cattle Producers See Big Stake in Corn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle producers have a bigger stake than
usual in this year's corn crop, fearing if it's too much on the
skimpy side the costs of feed will rise again and discourage
profitable expansion in 1990 and possibly beyond.
   Right now, according to Agriculture Department projections, this
fall's corn harvest could be around 7.45 billion bushels, up
sharply from the drought-shriveled 1988 output of 4.92 billion.
   But that would barely be enough corn to meet demands in the
1989-90 marketing year that will begin Sept. 1, according to the
USDA projections. A year later, on Sept. 1, 1990, the U.S. corn
stockpile would be only slightly larger.
   Corn prices, with a harvest of 7.45 billion bushels, would
probably average around $1.75 to $2.25 per bushel, down from $2.50
to $2.60 now forecast for the current marketing year.
   The projections are based on yield trends and other factors,
including weather conditions. The USDA's first corn and soybean
estimates based on actual field surveys will be issued Aug. 10.
   J. Tom Brink, research analyst for Cattle-Fax, says in the
latest newsletter of the National Cattlemen's Association that ``a
continued small volume of surplus stocks would leave feed grain
markets vulnerable to any hint of adverse weather during the 1990
growing season.''
   According to Brink's analysis, a corn crop of 8 billion bushels
this year would be just what cattle producers need _ production
large enough to restore corn inventories somewhat and to reduce
grain prices from levels of the past year.
   ``If the 1989 corn crop reaches only 7 billion bushels, we would
actually be in a worse situation than last year,'' he said. ``Corn
feed use and exports would have to be reduced. Supply rationing
would occur due to higher average prices. Feeder cattle and calf
prices would be hurt, while already tight feeding margins could be
further squeezed.''
   At USDA, livestock economists say poor pasture and range
conditions in the northern and central plains led to a larger
number of slaughter of beef cows than had been expected.
   Also, in the second quarter, beef production rose more than 4
percent from last winter, largely because of more cattle sold out
of feedlots. Most of the increase came in May and June.
   With higher feed costs and rising prices of feeder cattle, many
feedlot operators had profits wiped out or squeezed tightly. New
placements were cut back.
   ``Short term, the possibility of reducing recent feedlot losses
seems minimal because seasonally higher fed cattle slaughter is
expected through much of August,'' says the department's Economic
Research Service. ``This likely will be keep a lid on further price
increases below the low $70s (per hundredweight).''
   The agency forecasts in a new outlook report that Omaha, Neb.,
prices of Choice-grade steers will average in the range of $69 to
$73 per 100 pounds during the third quarter, compared with nearly
$74 per hundredweight in the first and second quarters of this year.
   ``However, when smaller feedlot placements this spring begin to
show up as lower slaughter numbers this fall, weekly slaughter
rates should again decline ... and higher prices will result,'' the
report said. ``Even lower cow slaughter is possible and could
further reduce beef supplies, resulting in even higher slaughter
cattle prices.''
   The report said that rains ``have allayed immediate fears of
last year'' when drought ravaged crop yields and sent prices up.
But USDA economists warned that corn and soybean crops _ and future
prices _ will be ``strongly influenced by weather patterns'' over
the next few weeks and months.

   The Agriculture Department has sold 3,964
metric tons of surplus butteroil, a dairy product that costs
American taxpayers $14.5 million, to Mexico for $8.5 million.
   The deal also included a three-year commercial credit package
for Compania Nacional de Subsistancias Populares (CONASUPO), a
Mexican government trading company, Undersecretary Richard T.
Crowder said Thursday.
   Deliveries are scheduled in August and October, he said. The
butteroil was sold to Mexico for $2,140 per ton to be delivered to
rail cars at the U.S.-Mexico border. That is equal to 97 cents per
pound. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.
   According to recent figures by the department's Commodity Credit
Corp., which handles commodity surpluses, it costs taxpayers about
$1.66 per pound, or $3,660 per ton, to acquire surplus butteroil
under the agency's dairy price support program.
   The sales at lower prices, which reflect world markets, were
ordered by Congress in 1985 farm law and under last year's Hunger
Relief Act. A total of 150,000 tons of dairy products a year must
be sold for export through 1990.
   Some 33,241 tons have been sold so far this year to foreign
buyers.

   Production of farm-raised catfish in June
totaled 27.6 million pounds liveweight, up 21 percent from a year
earlier, says the Agriculture Department.
   The average price paid to growers for catfish delivered to
plants was 75 cents a pound, down three cents from June 1988, the
department said Thursday. That was the first time this year that
the monthly average was down from a year earlier.

   A London court recommended the extradition to
Australia of an antiques dealer accused of giving drugs to heroin
addicts so they would steal valuables for him.
   Norman Cocks, 47, faces a total of 12 charges in Australia.
   Ten involve alleged trafficking in heroin between January 1984
and December 1985. The other two accuse him of handling stolen
goods in Australia in November 1985.
   He awaits a final extradition ruling by Home Secretary Douglas
Hurd. No date was given for that ruling.
   Prosecutor Michael Birnbaum, appearing on behalf of the
Australian government, told the court Thursday that Cocks was
involved in antiques dealing and ran a pawn shop in Victoria,
Australia.
   Birnbaum said that Cocks, a Melbourne native, met two heroin
addicts and hired them to steal to provide him with stock. He said
Cocks received the stolen goods and paid the men in heroin.

   Democrats in Congress are praising President
Bush's call for an expanded U.S. space program but want to know how
he expects to pay for it.
   Several pointed to domestic programs gutted by budget cutting
and said the costly space ventures of the 1960s may not be
affordable in the 1990s.
   Bush marked the 20th anniversary Thursday of the first lunar
landing by proposing that the United States establish a base on the
moon in the 21st century as a stepping stone for manned mission to
Mars.
   ``The party of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson applauds the
decision of President Bush to recommit America to space
exploration,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   ``But the real test of presidential leadership is not whether he
can marshal the words but the resources to restore America's
preeminence in space. In sum, Mr. President, there's no such thing
as a free launch,'' added Gephardt.
   Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., said Bush offered ``the country not a
challenge to inspire us, but a daydream to briefly entertain us''
in making his proposal ``with no money, no timetable, and no plan.''
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., noted the administration itself had
reduced NASA's planned request for $140 million next year for the
Pathfinder development program, a preparation for a manned Mars
mission, down to $93 million.
   Funding for a space station also was debated as the House
approved by voice vote a $65.1 billion fiscal year 1990
appropriation for the Veterans Administration, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development and 18 other independent agencies,
including NASA.
   ``The space station is not the way to go to space. It is the B-2
bomber of the space program,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   He was defeated in his attempt to transfer $714 million from
funding for the space station to programs for veterans medical
care, pollution control and low-income and elderly housing.
   Schumer estimated the lunar space station and a manned trip to
Mars would cost $400 billion.
   ``I am a believer in space technology,'' said Schumer, ``but you
can't have everything. As we reach for the stars, let us not forget
those who live underneath them.''
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., suggested some space money could better
be used to eliminate ``lousy housing, inadequate education and
schools loaded with asbestos.''
   ``For most people, their universe will be for all of their lives
right here on Earth,'' he said.
   But Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., argued that expanded space
exploration, including completion of a lunar space station, was
essential to national security and satellite communications
development.
   ``The myth we have to shatter is that space is a luxury,'' said
Roe.
   The House appropriations bill earmarks $1.65 billion of NASA's
$12.2 billion budget for the space station. The bill is $1 billion
less than the Bush administration requested.

   Up to 600 members of two rival Navajo
Indian factions and tribal police clashed Thursday night, resulting
in the shooting death of one man and injuries to 10 other people,
witnesses and officials said.
   Two hundred to 300 supporters of suspended tribal Chairman Peter
MacDonald occupied the tribe's business and finance building late
Thursday after a pro-MacDonald rally that turned violent,
authorities said.
   The violence in this tribal capital near the Arizona-New Mexico
line was the latest episode in the struggle for power on the Navajo
Reservation. With 200,000 members the Navajos are the nation's
largest Indian tribe.
   A federal Bureau of Indian Affairs tactical team was working
with tribal police and the FBI was expected to arrive at the remote
reservation Friday morning, said Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. in Washington.
   Jimmy Dixon of Indian Wells, Ariz., died at the U.S. Public
Health Service Hospital in nearby Fort Defiance, said Willie Keeto
Jr. and Howard Bitsuie, co-presidents of MacDonald's group, the
Pro-Dineh Voters.
   Six people suffered gunshot wounds and six others suffered other
injuries, officials said.
   Hospital workers and tribal police refused to confirm the report
of a fatal shooting.
   However, Goldstein said officials had been notified that one
person had been killed and three wounded.
   According to Goldstein, tribal Police Chief George John was in
Washington and pro-MacDonald forces were to trying to reinstate
former Police Chief Wilbur Kellogg.
   ``There was a march to police headquarters,'' the spokesman said.
   Around 5:45 p.m., members of the pro-MacDonald crowd of 200 to
300 people attacked and beat tribal poliice Lt. Daniel Hawkins,
police said. They said someone in the crowd took Hawkins' gun and
shot two other officers.
   Witnesses said Dixon shot tribal police Sgt. Daniel Lee of
Window Rock with a police revolver taken from an officer during the
fracas. Another officer then shot Dixon, witnesses said.
   Lee was in critical condition at the Fort Defiance hospital,
where he, Dixon and three other Navajos were taken, according to
Pro-Dineh officials and others.
   Tribal spokeswoman LeNora Begay identified the other wounded as
tribal policeman Emerson Jake of Kayenta, Ariz., and demonstrators
Arnold Begay and Ashkie Bahe.
   Jake was beaten and handcuffed when he approached the
pro-MacDonald rally, said LeNora Began, who is not related to
Arnold Begay.
   Members of the pro-MacDonald crowd used clubs to break into the
business office and were holding off a similar-size crowd outside,
witnesses said.
   The business and finance building and another building were
close at noon Thursday because of threats of an attack on the
buildings, officials said.
   The MacDonald supporters had been camped just outside of town
all day, witnesses said.
   ``Dineh'' is a Navajo word meaning ``the people.''
   MacDonald issued an order instructing Kellogg to take over as
police chief and ``restore law and order'' on the reservation.
   MacDonald's whereabouts could not be determined Thursday night.
   The situation in Window Rock has been volatile since the
88-member Tribal Council began its Winter Meeting in mid-February.
   Dissidents who had seen MacDonald accused during televised U.S.
Senate hearings of official corruption and misconduct went into the
meeting vowing to remove him from office.
   Late Feb. 13, a 49-member council majority voted to place
MacDonald on administrative leave.
   MacDonald, who has denied any wrongdoing, balked at leaving
office after the council refused to consider paying his legal fees.
Throughout March and April he continued to act as chairman for a
dwindling group of supporters.
   On March 10, the council appointed Leonard Haskie interim
chairman.
   Haskie and his departmental appointees eventually managed to win
recognition from Citibank of Arizona and from the Bureau of Indian
Affairs' local office as the tribe's chief executive. A tribal
judge in Window Rock District Court also ruled for Haskie. By May,
Haskie and his appointees had taken hold of the tribal government's
reins.

<HEAD>Researchers Say AIDS Virus Infects Many More Cells Than Previously
Believed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS patients may have up to 1,000 times more
diseased blood cells than previously believed, making it even
harder to stamp out the virus that causes the fatal disease,
according to a National Institutes of Health study published today.
   In a study led by Steven M. Schnittman of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, researchers discovered that in
a patient with active AIDS the virus that causes the disease can
infect up to 1 percent _ 1 of every 100 _ of a blood cell known as
the T4 lymphocyte.
   Schnittman said in an interview that previous studies, which
used indirect measurements of the infection rate, had calculated
that only 1 in every 10,000 to 100,000 of the T4 lymphocytes in
such a patient were infected.
   The higher rate of infection, a factor that doctors call ``virus
load,'' suggests that it will be more difficult to develop a
therapy to find and eliminate each and every pocket of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which causes AIDS.
   ``The quantity of the virus (found in the study) was a lot
higher than previously expected,'' Schnittman. ``There are more
cells infected, a greater proportion, than we knew before.''
   Schnittman said the study showed that a new research procedure,
called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, may be used to monitor
the level of AIDS infection as a patient progresses from a point of
showing no symptoms to where the disease becomes life-threatening.
   With PCR, he said, researchers could measure precisely the
effects of drugs being tested to control or kill the AIDS virus.
   A research report authored by Schnittman and eight other
scientists was published today in the journal Science.
   Schnittman said he and his colleagues used blood samples from
patients with active AIDS to conduct the PCR search for the virus.
   Researchers first separated from the samples the T4 lymphocytes.
These immunity cells are thought to be the primary target of the
HIV virus.
   Blood studies in the past counted the number of cells infected
with the AIDS virus by measuring proteins triggered by an active
HIV virus. Thus, the level of infection was inferred instead of
directly measured.
   But Schnittman said the PCR technique detects the genetic
pattern of the AIDS virus while it is within a cell. In this way,
he said, the researchers could find infected cells even when the
AIDS virus is inactive.
   The PCR survey, which was developed only about a year ago, he
said, is an important new tool to help scientists understand the
life cycle of the highly complex AIDS virus, and perhaps find a
weak point where the killer disease could be attacked with drugs.
   Schnittman said the PCR study also showed that the AIDS virus
does not readily infect another type of immunity cell, the
monocyte, which also circulates in the blood. This finding is a
surprise, he said, because a monocyte matures into an immune cell
called macrophage. Studies have shown that macrophages in the
brain, liver and lymph nodes can be heavily loaded with AIDS.
   ``The real Trojan horse in the body is the T4 cells and not the
monocytes,'' said Schnittman. ``This shows the importance of
focusing therapies on the (T4 lymphocyte) cells.''
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks immune cells in the
body and renders them unable to resist disease. The HIV virus,
which causes AIDs, is spread most often through sexual intercourse
with infected persons or through needles shared by intravenous drug
users.
   As of May 31, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 97,193 Americans,
of whom more than half, or 56,468, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to
have recovered from AIDS.
   Schnittman's coauthors in the study were H. Clifford Lane,
Ferdinand Massari, Cecil H. Fox and Tony Fauci, all of NIH;
Miltiades C. Psallidopoulos, Louis Thompson and Normal P. Salzman
of Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington; and
Michael Baseler of Program Resources, Inc.

<HEAD>Newspaper Joint Operating Agreements Criticized</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROSE ANN ROBERTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law that allows rival newspapers to share
business operations is weakening American journalism and should be
repealed, critics say.
   ``Never have so many given so much to so few for no good reason
at all,'' Bruce B. Brugmann, editor and publisher of the
70,000-circulation weekly San Francisco Bay Guardian, told a House
Judiciary subcommittee hearing Thursday.
   Brugmann's testimony came 20 years after he first opposed the
Newspaper Preservation Act. He said Thursday that the only people
who have benefited from joint operating agreements are rich
publishers who have become richer.
   The agreement between the two San Francisco dailies, the
Examiner and the Chronicle, Brugmann said, has led to less
competitive journalism.
   ``Non-competitive journalism breeds dull, irrelevant newspapers
that few people want to read,'' he said.
   The law allows newspapers in the same city to merge business
operations when one of the papers is in danger of failing. News
gathering operations remain separate.
   ``In 1970, the act was hailed as a necessary means of preventing
daily newspapers from falling victim to fierce market forces,''
said subcommittee chairman Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas. ``Yet, since
passage of the act, some estimate that over 200 papers have ceased
operation.''
   Jerry Friedheim, president of the American Newspaper Publishers
Association, testified that the act ``helped the marketplace evolve
and prosper.''
   ANPA is an international trade association of more than 1,400
newspapers, which represent 90 percent of the total daily and
Sunday newspaper circulation in the United States.
   ``No newspaper executives I know of would roll back either the
law or the decisions made in good faith during its existence,''
Friedheim said.
   W. Edward Wendover, editor and publisher of the weekly Community
Crier in Plymouth-Canton, Mich., said the act has ``encouraged
concentration of newspaper ownership, peculiar competitive
practices and lessened the vigor and quality of newspapering.''
   ``The principle of a free press cannot be maintained when the
biggest newspaper chains enjoy unregulated monopoly status,''
Wendover said, calling on Congress to repeal the law.
   Wendover testified for Michigan Citizens for an Independent
Press, a group of 1,400 readers, advertisers and employees of The
Detroit News and Detroit Free Press. The group filed a lawsuit in
August to block a joint operating agreement between the two papers.
   Gannett Co. Inc., which owns The Detroit News, and Knight-Ridder
Inc., owner of the Detroit Free Press, say the agreement is needed
to allow the Free Press to survive.
   The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on the
case this fall. There are 18 active joint operating agreements in
the United States.
   Brooks said his economic and commercial law subcommittee will
study the testimony and decide whether further hearings are needed.

<HEAD>Seniors Groups Say AMA Looks Out for Doctors, Not Elderly</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocacy groups for the elderly say the
American Medical Association is putting wealth for doctors ahead of
health for seniors in its campaign against a congressional proposal
to restrain rising Medicare costs.
   A coalition of senior citizen organizations Thursday said the
AMA was using scare tactics and distortions in suggesting health
care for older Americans could be rationed under legislation that
would set annual goals for Medicare reimbursements to doctors.
   Newspaper ads run by the AMA depict a frail elderly woman and
warn she could become an ``expenditure target'' and that ``services
would have to be reduced'' if the proposed spending targets were
exceeded.
   The ad is aimed at legislation approved by the House Ways and
Means Committee that would set yearly expenditure goals for
Medicare physicians' costs nationwide to discourage doctors from
padding profits by performing unneeded procedures.
   If spending exceeded the target, Medicare-approved doctor fees
would not rise as rapidly in the following year as they would
otherwise. A similar proposal is under consideration in the Senate.
   The proposed spending targets are part of a broader package
designed to cut down rising Medicare costs. The legislation also
would revise the fees paid to doctors for various services to more
accurately reflect the skill, training and time involved. It also
would limit the amount that doctors could charge Medicare patients
on top of the government reimbursement rate.
   Theresa McKenna, director of information for the National
Council of Senior Citizens, said the spending targets would help
``put a stop to price gouging by America's physicians.''
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Villers Advocacy
Associates, said the AMA campaign against the targets was designed
to ``protect the wealth of doctors at the expense of the health of
seniors.''
   ``The AMA is conducting a slick and dishonest media campaign to
protect their control of Medicare's golden goose, while pretending
to be acting for older Americans who are in fact being squeezed by
skyrocketing doctor charges,'' he said.
   The AMA responded that its ads and lobbying campaign contained
no distortions and were designed to ``alert people to a danger'' of
medical service cutbacks.
   ``That is our point of view and we will argue with anyone who
wishes to engage us,'' the association said in a statement. ``What
is going on is nothing more nor less than a close-down of service.''
   Among the groups represented at Thursday's press conference were
the Older Women's League, Gray Panthers, National Council on the
Aging, AFL-CIO, AFSCME Retiree Program, and the National Caucus and
Center on Black Aged.

<HEAD>Congress Moves to Speed Return of Wolves to Park</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A move by Congress to speed the return of
wolves to Yellowstone Park is ``clearly premature,'' says the head
of the National Park Service.
   Parks Director James Ridenour told a House panel Thursday that
the bill introduced by Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, would interfere
with studies under way to find out if wolves can be returned to the
popular park without hurting the many interests involved.
   Battle lines are clearly drawn between environmentalists and
sportsmen in the controversy over whether to restore the only
indigenous species still missing from the Yellowstone area.
   Those pushing for return of the animals say that under the
Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act,
wolves must be returned to restore the wilderness areas to their
original state.
   Sportsmen who hunt elk, which are the prey of wolves, and
domestic livestock owners want to keep the wolves out. They are
supported by several Western lawmakers.
   Rupert Cutler, president of the Defenders of Wildlife, told the
Interior subcommittee on national parks and public lands the wolf
was the ``crown jewel'' of the country's ``most famous natural
monument (Yellowstone Park).''
   But Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, disdained that opinion, saying
``I've lived through the romanticizing'' of the wolf.
   He said the wolf is, ``without any doubt, second to man in his
ability as a predator against the clove-footed animal.''
   Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., called the bill ``blatantly
anti-sportsman.''
   Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said livestock owners will kill the
wolves to defend their animals ``and I would support that. ... We
do not need this legislation.''
   However, Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of the
subcommittee, said the legislation was needed because the Interior
Department has stalled in its responsibility to return wolves to
Yellowstone.
   Ridenour said the park service goal is to return the area to its
natural state, barring mitigating conditions.
   He said the Interior Department, of which the park service is a
part, wants to first determine if the wolf population could be
controlled once returned, as well as ascertain the effect wolves
would have on wildlife in and around the park and on grizzly bears.
   Owens' bill calls for an environmental impact statement and
action by the Interior secretary after the statement is completed.
   But Ridenour said park managers want to avoid a ``headlong
rush'' to return the wolves.
   ``Let me re-emphasize the need to let the process work,'' he
said. ``The requirements of this bill are clearly premature.''
   David Mech, a wolf expert with the Fish and Wildlife Service,
said each wolf eats the equivalent of three adult elks a year,
which should not endanger the population of about 35,000 elk in the
Yellowstone area.
   Mech said the elk that died last year of bad weather would have
been the likely prey of wolves.

   The portrait of Leona Helmsley emerging in a
Manhattan courtroom bears little resemblance to the smiling queen
whose finicky attention to detail is trumpeted in slick magazine
ads for her Helmsley Palace hotel.
   Sure, both Leonas would demand the best. But the queen would pay
for it, and the queen's English would be a bit more majestic.
   ``You (expletive), you're not my partner; you don't tell me how
to spend my money,'' Mrs. Helmsley once said, according to a former
underling who was a prosecution witness at her federal trial on
extortion and tax fraud charges.
   The witness, former Helmsley executive Jeremiah McCarthy,
testified that Mrs. Helmsley screamed at him when he refused to
sign a phony voucher that billed work performed at her mansion to
the Helmsley business.
   Mrs. Helmsley and two former employees allegedly engaged in a
false-invoice scheme and used company money to pay for $4 million
in work on the Helmsleys' 28-room estate in Greenwich, Conn. She
also is accused of taking payoffs from Helmsley suppliers,
sometimes in cash-plump envelopes.
   Her 80-year-old husband, Harry, was severed from the case
because of a loss of memory caused by a series of slight strokes.
   Thus far, the jury has heard only the prosecution case. The
trial, in its third week, is expected to last two more months, and
there is no indication of whether Mrs. Helmsley will take the stand.
   She would have a lot to rebut. Each day, observers have been
regaled by stories starring the 69-year-old queen of a $5 billion
real estate empire.
   Mrs. Helmsley, never the people's choice in a town where rents
have skyrocketed, has become the people's pariah. Everette Dennis,
head of the Gannett Center for Media Studies, said Mrs. Helmsley
has become a person of ``singular unpopularity in New York.''
   Impeccably dressed and coiffed, she sits in the courtroom,
generally stoic but sometimes laughing, shaking her head or crying,
as witness after witness describes her as an overbearing, abusive,
capricious employer.
   There has been so much negative testimony regarding Mrs.
Helmsley's personality that U.S. District Court Judge John Walker
has called for a moratorium. ``I think this case would move much
more quickly if we concentrated on the evidence rather than the
personality issue,'' he said.
   But the jury had already gotten an earful:
   _McCarthy testified that Mrs. Helmsley once refused to pay a
$13,000 bill to a contractor who had constructed a barbecue pit.
McCarthy pleaded the contractor's case _ the man had six kids, he
said.
   ``Why didn't he keep his pants on? He wouldn't have so many
problems,'' Mrs. Helmsley said, according to the testimony.
   _Elizabeth Baum, a former housekeeper at the mansion, recalled
remarking to Mrs. Helmsley that the Helmsleys must pay a lot of
taxes. She recalled Mrs. Helmsley's response: ``We don't pay taxes,
only the little people pay taxes.''
   _Mrs. Helmsley told Steven Chang, a Helmsley engineer, to
duplicate at the estate an underground sound system she had seen at
Disney World. Chang said she charged the $57,000 cost to the
business, and then fired him because the hidden speakers were not
hidden enough and they once went on at 4:30 a.m.
   Her lawyer, Gerald A. Feffer, has done little to challenge the
unpleasant portrait of his client, except to point out that the
Helmsleys did pay $58 million in taxes from 1983 to 1985.
   In fact, Feffer has gone out of his way to underscore Mrs.
Helmsley's churlishness. In his opening statement, Feffer referred
to her as a ``tough bitch'' who was ``abrasive'' and ``demanding''
because of the pressures applied to a woman who fought to make it
in a man's world.
   ``In the United States we don't put people in jail for being
unpopular,'' Feffer told the jury.
   Under cross-examination, John Struck, a former employee, agreed
when Feffer suggested that employees working to build a pool
enclosure at the estate labored in terror _ what kind of explosion
would be forthcoming if they failed to finish in time for a July
Fourth party?
   ``God forbid, right?'' asked Feffer.
   ``That's for sure,'' replied Struck.

   Anti-abortion forces in Congress are preparing
to battle a House panel's decision to lift abortion funding
restrictions for the District of Columbia.
   The House Appropriations District of Columbia subcommittee voted
Thursday to allow the city to use its own money to pay for
Medicaid-funded abortions.
   The district had financed abortions from 1980 until last year,
when congressmen attached an amendment to the city budget banning
the use of federal or local money for abortions.
   Abortion opponents quickly said Thursday they will try to
restore the ban when the city's budget reaches the House floor.
   ``We have an amendment already drafted, and we are ready to go
with that again,'' said Brian Bennett, a spokesman for Rep. Robert
Dornan, R-Calif. ``We're hoping to have this one battle and move on
(to the Senate version of the budget).''
   City officials, who have called the anti-abortion measure an
intrusion on their right to self-governance, said they will fight
efforts to renew it.
   ``We will just dig in and prevail on this point of home rule
that has been restored to us,'' said Lurma Rackley, a spokeswoman
for Mayor Marion Barry Jr. ``We should be able to decide how to
spend our money.''
   Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said he favored lifting the
restriction in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling that
provides states greater latitude in drafting abortion laws.
   ``It will be interesting to see. ... We don't know what the
attitude will be on the floor of the House,'' Dixon said.
   Last year, Dornan and Reps. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., and
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., led the fight to prevent the city from spending
public money on abortions.
   Congress, which has review power over all city laws and the city
budget, is free to attach amendments or make changes in the laws
before approving them.
   The bill is scheduled for a vote by the full committee Aug. 3,
and committee officials said it will likely reach the House floor
after the House returns from summer recess on Sept. 5.

<HEAD>Action Planned to Speed up Banning of Harmful Farm Chemicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is
crafting a proposal aimed at easing public concern about food
safety by allowing earlier action to ban potentially dangerous farm
chemicals.
   The proposal, which must be approved by the Congress, was
inspired partly by public alarm over Alar, a chemical used on
apples that remained on the market long after its health risks were
brought into question, EPA officials said Thursday.
   ``The American public looked at the Alar situation and said
something is not altogether right here,'' said Bill Jordan,
director of the agency's office of policy and special projects.
``We think there really is a need to fix the system.''
   Groups representing farmers and chemical suppliers said they had
not seen all details of the EPA proposal, but they expressed mixed
feelings about some key provisions.
   The agency proposal calls for streamlining the procedures for
banning chemicals suspected of causing cancer or other diseases.
Jordan said the new system would allow the agency to cancel use of
a compound in less than two years. The process under current law
typically lasts a few years, sometimes much longer.
   The EPA also wants authority to remove a suspected dangerous
chemical from the market before it has fully investigated its
potential health risks. Current law requires firm evidence of a
serious health threat before sales may be suspended.
   Farmers and chemical manufacturers have resisted the idea of
making it easier to remove agricultural chemicals from the market
on an interim basis. But an official of the American Farm Bureau
Federation said his group's members are willing to accept a speedup
of EPA procedures for imposing permanent bans.
   Mark Maslyn, assistant director of the farm group's Washington
office, said the industry has agreed not to resist the speedier
procedure, but it will fight attempts to give EPA authority to
remove chemicals on a temporary basis.
   ``I've not been shown a very compelling case where that
authority is needed now,'' he said, adding that once the use of a
compound is suspended it will continue to have a ``black eye'' even
if later evidence shows it is not harmful.
   Jay Vroom, executive vice president of the National Agricultural
Chemicals Association, said his group sees a clear need to
alleviate public concern that the federal government cannot move
quickly enough to permanently ban dangerous chemicals.
   But Vroom said there is no need to expand the EPA's power to
make interim suspensions.
   ``It's bad for agriculture, it's certainly bad for consumers,''
he said.
   Jordan said efforts to streamline the banning process began in
spring when the public became alarmed over Alar.
   ``We were not happy with our inability to deal with the Alar
situation,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   The EPA plans to seek removal of a judicial appeals process that
chemical makers could use to delay agency efforts to ban suspected
compounds.
   Another proposed change would narrow the circumstances under
which chemical residues that pose more than a negligible health
risk would be permitted on food products.
   Legislation is expected to be sent to Capitol Hill by early
August, agency officials said. They said they had no estimates of
how much the changes would cost.

<BYLINE>From New Deal to New Balance? ^By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Franklin D. Roosevelt had the New Deal, John
F. Kennedy the New Frontier. Lyndon Johnson had the Great Society.
If Budget Director Richard Darman has his way, the catch-phrase for
the Bush years will be ``the New Balance.''
   Darman, who is considered one of the administration's top
political strategists, said the term sums up what George Bush has
brought to the presidency.
   ``There is new balance. One sees it in the tone and style of
bipartisan approaches to the budget and foreign policy,'' Darman
said Thursday in a speech to the National Press Club.
   The budget director said it also was evident in what he called
the administration's balanced proposals on the savings and loan
crisis, cleaning up air pollution and scaling back defense spending
_ all areas where Bush has sought compromise in place of staking
out unwavering ideological positions as Reagan did.
   ``Maybe it's time to assert that not all approaches to public
policy-making should soar with winged feet, that from time to time
America may benefit from leadership with its feet close to the
ground and with strides suited for the longer race,'' Darman said.
   Darman also used his first major policy address since taking
over as the administration's point man on the budget last January
to attack what he called ``cultural now-now-ism.''
   He said that was a shorthand label for ``our collective
shortsightedness, our obsession with the here and now, our
reluctance adequately to address the future.''
   Darman said one difficulty politicians face in trying to take a
long-term approach to problems is that ``voters and lobbyists for
the present are far better represented than the voters of the
future.''
   He called the federal budget deficit a prime example of the
country's philosophy of ``buy now and let others pay later.''
   While the deficits soared during the Reagan years, Darman
sidestepped questions about whether the prior administration, in
which he also served, should be held responsible for failing to
achieve solutions to the deficit and other long-term problems.
   ``Reagan brought us back our national pride and optimism,''
Darman said in response to a question after the speech. ``The next
job (for Bush) is to build on that.''
   By adopting the New Balance as a catch-phrase, Darman said the
administration could answer critics who carp about Bush's lack of
the ``vision thing.''
   ``We have come to demand drama and catch-phrases as if they were
constitutionally protected rights,'' Darman said. ``It's as if each
new White House communications director were a national account
manager obliged to outdo the creative talents who brought prior
generations the political equivalent of New Tide, New Cheer and New
Dawn.''
   Darman did concede one problem with using New Balance as the
administration's slogan _ it's also the name of a popular running
shoe.

   A former prisoner of war in Vietnam says
changing the Constitution to ban flag desecration would start a
wave of amendments which the United States would ``not survive as a
free nation.''
   James Warner, a Marine flight officer who spent 5{ years in a
North Vietnamese prison camp, and Vietnam War Medal of Honor winner
Gordon Roberts urged Congress Thursday to resist the political
pressure to change the Bill of Rights to outlaw burning of the
American flag.
   President Bush is supporting an effort in Congress to use an
amendment to undo the Supreme Court's ruling last month that flag
burning was a protected form of political expression.
   More than a dozen Republican lawmakers demonstrated their
enthusiasm for the amendment at a demonstration Thursday where
congressmen drenched an effigy of a flag-burner on the steps of the
Supreme Court.
   Testifying to the House Judiciary constitutional law
subcommittee, Warner said, ``If this amendment be issued by this
House, and ratified by this nation, there will come a deluge
against the Bill of Rights.''
   ``Our Bill of Rights has served as a legal restraint upon our
government for 200 years,'' said Warner, who is a lawyer. ``If
these restraints be removed, we shall not survive as a free
nation.''
   Roberts, who served with the Army in Vietnam, said the flag has
a special place in his heart, but said men do not ``serve this
country for the flag alone.''
   ``Each of us that has worn the uniform of this country are fully
aware that the Pledge of Allegiance ends in the words, `And Justice
for All,''' he said.
   Roberts recalled that on a recent visit to the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial he saw the flag reflected on the granite wall etched with
the names of the dead. ``They were as much a part of the flag as
the cloth and stitching,'' said Roberts.
   He also warned that an amendment would spark competition among
state legislators politicians for who could then enact the toughest
penalty for flag burning.
   The attractiveness of such one-upmanship was demonstrated before
a crush of television cameras in front of the high court, where the
Republican congressmen carried fire extinguishers and a bucket of
water to show how intended to deal with flag burners.
   The legislators, reacting to rumors that a flag-burning was
going to take place, cheered and shouted as some of them sprayed
and splashed their water at a stuffed-clothing effigy of Gregory
Lee Johnson, whose 1984 Texas flag-burning led to the court
decision.
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said Republicans were showing
Americans how to deal with flag burnings.
   ``If they don't have a bucket of water, I hope they take care of
business however they can,'' Rohrabacher said.
   Johnson, in a building across the street, said he never intended
to burn a flag as rumored.
   ``I'm not going to, like, fall into this silly trap,'' he said.

   The pilot who guided a crippled jetliner
to a crash landing showed superior airmanship and ``ought to be
elected to the aviation hall of fame,'' according to a flight
engineer familiar with DC-10s.
   ``If he lost all three hydraulic systems, then the world ought
to be thankful that as many people survived that did,'' said Joe
Sullivan of Richardson, Texas, retired flight engineer for American
Airlines. ``Without hydraulic, you're out of business.''
   A United Airlines DC-10 bound from Denver to Chicago crash
landed at Sioux Gateway Airport on Wednesday after pilot A.C.
Haynes, a 33-year United veteran, radioed that he had a ``complete
hydraulic failure.''
   At least 76 people died, but 174 or more survived the crash.
Haynes was hospitalized, but he and the other two cockpit crew
members were among the survivors.
   ``If all the hydraulics were out, he ought to be elected to the
aviation hall of fame,'' Sullivan said. ``He had to call on every
bit of his airmanship, and it had to be superior, not just good. I
think it was a major miracle.''
   Jim Burnett, a National Transportation Safety Board member, told
a news conference Thursday night that the DC-10's hydraulic system,
which allow pilots to manipulate wing and tail controls, contained
no fluid as Haynes tried to land the plane.
   Earlier, Bob Raynesford, a spokesman for the FAA regional office
in Kansas City, said the aircraft may have lost some hydraulic
power but some must have remained.
   ``We were in constant contact with the crew for about 40
minutes, and the aircraft became more and more difficult to control
as it got closer to Sioux City,'' Raynesford said. ``We are hearing
about total hydraulic failure, but it is way too premature to say
for sure.''
   John Nance, a pilot and aviation writer in Seattle interviewed
by the AP News Network, agreed the jumbo jet had to have some
hydraulic pressure to stay airborne.
   ``I think we can say that we have a flight control problem but
we did not, repeat, did not, have an airplane that was totally out
of hydraulics, or he wouldn't have been flying at all.''
   The pilot probably relied on a backup source of hydraulic power
called the ram air turbine that would have made it increasingly
difficult to control the aircraft as it approached the airport,
Nance said.
   The ram air turbine operates some control surfaces by directing
the rushing outside air. As the airplane slows for a landing, the
forced air pressure would be reduced, thus making the surfaces
harder to control.
   ``If all you've got powering your hydraulic systems is a ram air
turbine, then as you slow down it will slow down, and then there
will be less hydraulic pressure available and thus less control
over the airplane,'' Nance said.
   ``I'll tell you what, I'll bet that damn thing hasn't been used
twice,'' in the history of the aircraft, said Sullivan. ``It's an
absolute last resort. It's not going to save you.''
   Ken Plunkett, a researcher for the Aviation Safety Institute of
Columbus, Ohio, said the DC-10 has three separate hydraulic systems
that control virtually every function of the airplane.
   ``It controls the wing flaps, the tail elevators, the rudders,
the brakes, the steering _ everything,'' he said. ``If you lose it,
you lose most of your control over the plane. That seems to be what
happened here.''
   On small planes, control surfaces are small and can be operated
by direct linkages from the control panel. But on large planes, the
hydraulic system provides a power assist. If it fails, there are no
alternative manual controls.
   ``The DC-10 has redundant hydraulics,'' said Maury Seitz, a
retired Delta Airlines pilot who now lives in Hurst, Texas. ``It's
set up so that if you lose one, you won't lose all of your
hydraulic fluid. And if you lose one system, you still have other
systems.
   Seitz speculated that the pilot lost rudder control just as he
approached the runway.
   ``From the looks of it, he had that baby under control, but then
he got into a roll situation,'' he said.

   A new tour of London will skip Big Ben and focus
on dark alleys, smashed windows and graffiti-scarred walls _ places
where vandals ply their questionable craft.
   The less-than-scenic tour is part of the ``Vandal Trail,'' a
seminar designed to help building trades workers, civil servants
and others battle vandalism, organizers said Thursday.
   ``A guide will take them to typical danger spots like unlit
alleys, underpasses and underground garages and show them examples
of damage,'' said Hony Snell, spokesman for the Building Center, a
study institute run by the construction industry.
   ``There is lots of vandal damage to see in London: graffiti
sprayed on walls, smashed doors and houses in housing projects,
broken glass in telephone booths and bus shelters and smashed park
benches,'' she said.
   Speakers at the free Sept. 13 seminar will include a
psychologist who has studied vandals, a crime prevention expert and
an architect who designed vandal-proof buildings and fittings.
   The participants will be shown examples of construction
materials designed to resist vandals, such as tiles coated with
anti-graffiti paint and louver windows designed to resist burglars.
   Miss Snell said among recent acts by vandals was the insertion
of razor blades in elevator buttons so they could not be seen.

   At noon, the Sioux City fire department received a call from
Gateway Airport. It was a false alarm.
   Three and a half hours later, the call was genuine.
   United Airlines Flight 232, crippled by a loss of hydraulic
power, was attempting an emergency landing Wednesday afternoon on a
closed runway at the airport. The jet rolled to its right a few
feet from the ground, scraped its right wing, cartwheeled and burst
into flame.
   ``We've been talking for years that we've been awfully lucky
that we haven't had a severe accident down there, and that someday
it would happen,'' Fire Capt. Mike Kyle said.
   ``Someday finally came.''
   Here is the sequence of events, based on reports from officials
of the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal
Aviation Administration and press accounts. Times are Eastern
Daylight Time.
   _ 2:45 p.m. The plane left Denver with 282 passengers, including
three infants, a cockpit crew of three and eight flight attendants
en route to Chicago.
   _ More than an hour into the flight. An explosion rocked the
plane over western Iowa, severe enough to knock ``the flight
attendants to the floor,'' the chief attendant told the NTSB. The
flight crew had to struggle to keep control of the plane.
   _ 4:16 p.m. The pilot reported to air traffic control in
Minneapolis that the jet had lost one of its three engines and that
he was losing altitude and having difficulty controlling the
15-year-old aircraft.
   _ 4:17 p.m. Flying at 31,000 feet, the pilot reported ``complete
hydraulic failure.'' The hydraulic system powers vital control
surfaces on the wings and tail that direct an aircraft in flight,
as well as brakes on the ground.
   Air traffic control directed him to Dubuque, on Iowa's eastern
edge.
   _ 4:20 p.m. The pilot declared an emergency and controllers
rerouted him to Sioux City, about 400 miles west of Dubuque.
   _ 4:24 p.m. Air traffic received an ``Alert 2'' from the pilot,
an indication of major problems with an inbound aircraft.
   ``There was a report of almost no control ability. The aircraft
could only be turned to the right. They made three 360-degree
turns,'' NTSB member Jim Burnett told a news conference Thursday.
   _ 4:30 p.m. Field workers returning from a coffee break at Alta,
60 miles east of Sioux City, discovered an 8-by-12 section of the
plane in a field and notified local authorities.
   _ 4:32 p.m. ``The crew told the tower they had serious doubts of
making the airport'' and starting talking about small airports in
the area and four-lane highways, Burnett said.
   _ 4:40 p.m. The pilot informed his passengers the tail section
was damaged and the plane was en route to Sioux City for an
emergency landing.
   ``The plane was rocking from side to side. I think the pilot was
trying to control it with the engines,'' said passenger David
Landsberger.
   ``The stewardesses ran us through a practice drill. They told us
to keep our seatbelts fastened tightly and to put our heads between
our legs. About four minutes before we crashed, they told us to
brace ourselves.''
   _ 4:58 p.m. Flight 232 crashed into a cornfield just short of a
runway, burst into flames and skidded into an adjoining cornfield,
scattering wreckage over an area the size of three football fields.
   With the advance warning, emergency medical and rescue crews
were already at the scene.

<HEAD>Nevada, Far West Lead Nation in Income Growth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nevada's booming gambling industry is helping
the state lead the nation in the growth of non-farm income, the
government says.
   The Commerce Department, reporting non-farm income growth during
the 12 months ending March 30, said Thursday that Nevada led the
nation with a 15 percent increase.
   Wyoming trailed the other states, showing the only income growth
that was below the 5.9 percent rate of inflation for the 12-month
period, the department said.
   Nationwide, non-farm income increased 9.4 percent, although
there were wide differences between the states.
   Construction of more hotels and casinos, as well as the mining
industry, helped push Nevada ahead of the rest of the nation,
according to department analyst Rudolph E. DePass.
   Also showing sharp increases were Florida, whose non-farm income
was up 12.1 percent; Nevada's neighbor California, 10.7 percent;
Vermont, 10.5 percent; and Virginia, 10.5 percent.
   DePass said Wyoming's poor 5.7 percent increase was partly due
to declines in the construction and services industries.
   Other states at the low end of the rankings were: West Virginia,
up 6.3 percent; North Dakota, 6.4 percent; Oklahoma, 6.9 percent;
and Alaska, 7.2 percent.
   By region, the Far West, with Nevada and California, led the
nation with non-farm income growth of 10.5 percent. This was
followed by the Southeast, up 9.9 percent, and New England, up 9.6
percent.
   Other regions and their income growth rates were: Great Lakes, 9
percent; Mideast, 8.9 percent; Plains, 8.8 percent; Southwest, 8.6
percent; and Rocky Mountains, 8.2 percent.
   Differences between coastal and interior regions in non-farm
growth continued to narrow from the first quarter of 1988 to the
first quarter of 1989, DePass said, although coastal growth did
continue to outpace the inland areas.
   The Commerce Department focuses on changes in non-farm income as
a better indication of a region's prosperity because of the often
erratic nature of farm incomes.

   The dollar edged down slightly against the Japanese
yen Friday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 234.56
points, or 0.69 percent, ending the week at 33,899.43. The index
rose 107.70 points on Thursday.
   The dollar closed at 142.15 yen, down 0.08 yen from Thursday's
close of 142.23 yen. After opening lower at 141.60 yen, the
currency ranged between 141.53 yen and 142.25 yen.
   Currency traders attributed the dollar's lower opening to its
decline in New York, following comments by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   In testimony before Congress on Thursday, Greenspan acknowledged
that ``signs of softness'' in the American economy have shown up
and said the Fed must closely monitor the slowing economy.
   ``Everyone is reluctant to take long positions for the dollar,
nearing the weekend and Sunday's parliamentary elections,'' said
Norio Takeda, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   Takeda said investors are concerned over a possible early
election for the nation's powerful House of Representatives if the
governing Liberal Democratic Party suffers a major setback Sunday.
   Numerous newspaper surveys forecast a heavy loss for the LDP,
which may cause the yen to lose value.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index shed its earlier gains on
profit-taking selling, with many investors foreseeing a defeat for
ruling party candidates in the election, Kazuyuki Suzuki of Daiwa
Securities said.
   Factors contribuing to a gloomy outlook for the LDP are the
influence-buying Recruit scandal, an unpopular 3-percent
consumption tax imposed April 1, and allegations that Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno has kept paid mistresses.

<HEAD>Threatening Fan Mail Sometimes Ends Up With the FBI</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER BOWLES</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Fans who appear to be asking for more than a
signature or a photo in letters they dash off to celebrities may
get an unwanted response from a federal agent.
   Tuesday's slaying of actress Rebecca Schaeffer, who was sent at
least one letter by her alleged attacker, and a lawsuit filed by
actor Michael J. Fox against a voracious letter writer, have
heightened concerns about communications between stars and fans.
   Fan mail is carefully scrutinized in Hollywood by celebrity
agents, publicists and representatives who look for threats _
obvious or veiled.
   ``If we get a threatening letter, the first thing we do is make
the client and additional representatives aware of it,'' said David
Brokaw, who handles many high-profile movie stars. ``If it's
something we feel concerns us, we go to the authorities and report
it.''
   During his 18 years in the business, his office has received
just ``three or four that have concerned me. I've always called the
FBI.''
   John Robert Bardo, 19, charged in the slaying of Miss Schaeffer,
who starred in the sitcom ``My Sister Sam'' with Pam Dawber, wrote
her a love letter, Los Angeles police said.
   It was affectionate and ``a bit rambling'' but not threatening,
said Detective Dan Andrews.
   A 26-year-old Camarillo woman pleaded innocent in Los Angeles
Superior Court this week to charges of sending thousands of
threatening letters and rabbit droppings to Fox, the star of the
former hit series ``Family Ties.''
   But a judge refused on Monday to release Tina Marie-Ledbetter,
who was being held without bail at the Sybil Brand Institute for
Women.
   Fox testified that he feared for his safety and that of his
family. He said he received life-threatening letters over the
course of a year, but 800 of them arrived last July when he married
actress Tracy Pollan.
   FBI spokesman Jim Neilson said the FBI investigates any kind of
extortion if it goes through the mail. He declined to comment on
celebrity mail.
   Most fan letters are addressed to the production studio where
the actors last worked or the public relations office representing
them. Fan magazines frequently publish such addresses.
   ``We get several hundred pieces of fan mail a week,'' said Dick
Grant, whose clients include Joan Rivers, Larry Hagman and Richard
Dreyfuss. ``We have people who read through it. If it's regular
mail, it goes to a fan mail service for photos. If it's personal, a
letter about a terminally ill child who wants to meet a star, it's
referred to the star's office. If it's threatening, it goes to the
FBI.''
   The tone of a threatening letter usually determines how
seriously its contents are taken.
   ``You have to look at the way it is written,'' said Dale Olsen,
who represents stars like Dyan Cannon, Shirley MacLaine and Sally
Kirkland.
   ``If it's very intelligently written, grammatically correct and
appears to come from someone who has a clear idea, then it can be
dangerous,'' Olsen said.
   ``If the letter is from someone who is less educated, I think
more often than not it's just a fantasy and you don't react to it.''
   Maryann Ridini, head of publicity, advertising and promotion at
Stephen J. Cannell Productions, makers of ``21 Jump Street,''
``Wiseguy'' and ``Hunter,'' said she takes every threatening letter
seriously.
   ``If it is threatening we immediately take it to our security
person,'' Ridini said. ``We don't mess around with it, they deal
with it and take it to the proper authorities.
   ``We don't take anything lightly. If it's a threat, it needs to
be investigated properly.''

<HEAD>Court Case Mirrors Israeli Debate on the PLO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: To CORRECT that appeal held Thursday, SUB grafs 5, 12, 18.

<TEXT>
   Israel's Supreme Court is hearing an appeal by
four peace activists convicted of meeting with PLO officials, a
politically charged case that mirrors the debate over a possible
PLO role in any peace settlement.
   The court arguments are legal ones, but they focus on the wider
issue of whether dealing with the PLO can hasten peace or only give
credibility to what the government considers a terrorist
organization bent on Israel's destruction.
   Attorney Avigdor Feldman says his clients, the first people
convicted under an amendment to Israel's anti-terrorist law, met
with PLO officials to help end the long Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``They were trying to stop the bloodshed in the (occupied)
territories,'' Feldman said. ``Their meeting was for the purpose of
peace.''
   On Thursday, prosecutor Ariyeh Romanoff argued that the peace
activists's meeting with 15 PLO representatives, held in Romania in
1986, was a dangerous act of protest.
   ``We are talking about a demonstration against the law and not
activities on behalf of peace,'' Romanoff said.
   He added they commited an ``ideological crime ... as serious as
murder and other criminal violations'' in the context of the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   The 19-month revolt, in which 572 Palestinians and 37 Israelis
have died, is also at the heart of the national debate.
   The rebellion is widely credited with leading to PLO Chief
Yasser Arafat's recognition of Israel, and some leftist Israeli
politicians and dovish members of the mainstream Labor Party see
Arafat's moderation as an opening for Israel to talk to the PLO.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens
argue that any contact with the PLO hinders attempts to reach a
settlement with non-PLO Palestinians in the occupied territories.
   Abba Eban, a senior statesman of the center-left Labor Party,
ridiculed that stand in Sunday's Jerusalem Post. ``We refuse to
negotiate with those who are willing and are ready to negotiate
with those who don't exist,'' he wrote.
   The arguments are likely to rage on longer than the Supreme
Court case. But after hearing the appeal Thursday the judges gave
one of the defendants permission to take a month's trip abroad,
hinting their judgment may take a while.
   The four defendants _ Latif Dori, Yael Lotan, Eliezer Feiler and
Reuven Kaminer _ were convicted last year of violating a 1986 law
that made contacts with the PLO a misdemeanor.
   They were sentenced to six months in jail each, along with
one-year suspended sentences, but the jail terms later were
commuted to community service. Each was also ordered to pay a
$2,000 fine.
   The outcome of their appeal is likely to affect several other
cases.
   Peace activist Abie Nathan also has been charged with violating
the anti-terrorist law by meeting last year with Arafat, but his
trial was postponed until September pending the outcome of the
court appeal.
   Last month, right-wing members of the Knesset, or parliament,
demanded that Attorney General Yosef Harish press charges against
four left-wing legislators for also meeting with Arafat. Harish
said he intended to press charges.
   During a recess in Thursday's appeal, one of the defendants,
Kaminer, said he would turn to the Knesset to change the law
against meeting with the PLO if the court did not overturn it.
   ``The paradox here is not only are we not guilty of this, we
opposed terrorism in our meeting,'' he said. ``The anti-terror law
was not meant to put people who oppose terrorism in jail.''

   A young man accused of stalking and killing
actress Rebecca Schaeffer in Los Angeles plans to fight extradition
to California, his lawyer said.
   Robert John Bardo, 19, was ordered held on $1 million bond
Thursday. He appeared from the Pima County Jail via closed-circuit
television before Superior Court Judge Pro Tem Walter U. Weber on a
California murder fugitive warrant.
   Weber set the bond, which Los Angeles authorities had requested,
and scheduled an Aug. 18 hearing to review the status of
California's extradition efforts.
   Bardo, who was being held in the jail's mental health unit under
a suicide watch, gave no audible reply and did not speak during the
proceeding.
   Lori Lefferts, the public defender appointed to represent Bardo,
said she advised Bardo to not waive extradition.
   Earlier, Ms. Lefferts said Bardo's mental competency could be at
issue.
   Bardo was arrested Wednesday by Tucson police for running in and
out of traffic on Interstate 10.
   After his arrest, detectives said, Bardo gave Tucson police
statements related to Ms. Schaeffer that prompted them to notify
authorities in Los Angeles, where Miss Schaeffer, co-star of the
defunct ``My Sister Sam,'' was shot to death Tuesday.
   ``I don't want to say he confessed, but he implicated himself,
for sure,'' said Los Angeles police Detective Dan Andrews.
   A female friend of Bardo's living in Tennessee also called Los
Angeles police headquarters Wednesday to tell police of his
obsession with Miss Schaeffer. The woman told authorities Bardo had
a video collection of her television shows and an autographed
publicity photo, Los Angeles police Detective Dan Andrews said.
   Andrews said Bardo had written Miss Schaeffer an affectionate
love letter that was ``a bit rambling.''
   Andrews said the friend also told authorities that Bardo said
``he was going to harm Miss Schaeffer,'' but investigators do not
know why he might have wanted to do so.
   Miss Schaeffer, who appeared in the current film ``Scenes From
the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills,'' was shot once in the chest
Tuesday at the door of her apartment building.
   The weapon has not been found. Tucson Sgt. Paul Hallums said
officers who searched the Bardo family's Tucson home Wednesday
night and seized several bundles, including papers and a telephone
directory, but did not find a gun.
   Los Angeles detectives said Bardo is believed to have traveled
the 480 miles to Los Angeles by bus and to have returned to Tucson
late Tuesday. Andrews said Bardo apparently had gone to California
several times in the past year and had called Miss Schaeffer's
agency.
   Bardo told Tucson Magistrate Clifford Hofmann he quit a job last
week at a fast-food restaurant, where he was a custodian. Bardo
appeared before Hofmann, also via closed-circuit television, on a
misdemeanor count of obstructing a street or freeway.

   U.S. health officials say an AIDS testing and
counseling program in Boston set up to serve an estimated 14,000
intravenous drug abusers shows promise in reaching that high-risk
group.
   In its first year, Project TRUST served 688 clients,
administering tests to 635 for infection with HIV, the virus which
causes AIDS, the national Centers for Disease Control reported
Thursday. TRUST is an acronym for Teaching, Referral,
Understanding, Support and Testing.
   Project TRUST's 635 testing clients compared with just 473 who,
the CDC said, came for anomymous testing at other test sites and
clinics in the Boston area. And 79 percent, or 503 of Project
TRUST's 635 testing clients, returned to learn the results and seek
counseling.
   ``For anonymous testing, that's very high,'' said CDC researcher
Dr. Charles S. Rabkin, adding that some AIDS testing and counseling
programs have seen as few as 10 percent of clients return for
results and follow-up.
   CDC officials attributed the program's success to its location
in a heavy drug-use neighborhood, promotion through pamphlets and
word of mouth, and to the fact that several of the outreach workers
were recovering drug addicts.
   The CDC said intravenous drug abusers made up one-third of all
U.S. AIDS cases reported last year.
   ``It's worthwhile to have services directed for intravenous drug
users,'' Rabkin said. ``Services specially tailored for them can be
successful.''
   ``The high percentage ... who returned for their test results
indicates that HIV prevention measures can be effectively
provided'' to intravenous drug abusers ``if services are tailored
to the specific needs and circumstances of this high-risk group,''
the Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly report.
   Meanwhile, the CDC said Thursday that 28 states require
reporting of HIV infections to public health authorities. Those
states account for 45 percent of the U.S. population and 24 percent
of the nearly 100,000 AIDS cases reported through last month.
   Such reporting, the CDC said, is useful in directing patient
counseling and sex-partner notification efforts. Eighteen of the 28
HIV-reporting states require reports by name, the CDC said, but
``reporting should be accompanied by appropriate safeguards for
confidentiality.''
   All states require the reporting of actual AIDS cases to public
health authorities.

<HEAD>Senate Backs Administration Talks With PLO</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate's defeat of a determined effort to
curb the U.S. dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization
hands President Bush's Mideast policy a significant boost from
Congress.
   In a separate action on Thursday, the Senate also voted 59-39 to
open the door to possible U.S. military aid to non-communist
resistance forces in Cambodia.
   Supporters of the aid amendment offered by Sen. Charles Robb,
D-Va., called it an essential step to help the administration's
efforts to prevent a return to power of the Khmer Rouge, which was
blamed for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians during
their four-year reign in the late 1970s.
   Opponents said the United States should not aid any faction in
Southeast Asia in light of the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said the Senate was moving too
quickly, approving the possible provision of military aid in the
middle of the night and without proper consideration and debate.
   ``I stood on this floor when we slid into the war in Vietnam,''
Byrd said. ``I think we should let history give us some guidance
before we take sudden action here and write a blank check for the
president.''
   The Senate, by voice vote early today, late approved the overall
bill authorizing $4.6 billion for the operation of the State
Department and allied agencies in the 1990 fiscal year.
   The Senate shelved, 75-23, an amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., which would have halted the talks unless the president
certified none of the PLO participants had any link with an act of
terrorism that had resulted in the murder, injury or kidnapping of
an American citizen.
   Bush sent a strongly worded letter defending the talks, calling
Helms' measure a formula for ending the dialogue and damaging if
not destroying the U.S. role in the Mideast peace process. He said
it was an unconstitutional assault on his powers to conduct U.S.
foreign policy.
   The Senate approved, 97-1, a compromise that would stop the
dialogue only if the president actually knew that one of the PLO
negotiators was a direct participant in an act of terrorism and
advised the Congress.
   Helms, the only senator to vote ``no,'' called that ``nothing
but a fig leaf to permit the State Department to continue to do
what they've been doing.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine said: ``It is my
understanding that if the president knows of such facts he will
advise the Congress,'' thus cutting off the talks.
   Helms, however, said the Senate had a clear choice.
   ``Are we or are we not going to reward terrorists?'' he asked.
``Are we or are we not going to bestow respectability upon them?''
   Helms introduced the amendment after two unannounced meetings
between Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, and
PLO representative Saleh Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad.
   Khalaf is accused of masterminding the massacre of Israeli
athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich and is a suspect in
the 1973 assassination of the U.S. ambassador to the Sudan, Cleo
Noel Jr.
   The United States opened talks with the PLO in December after
Chairman Yasser Arafat publicly renounced terrorism and accepted
Israel's right to exist.
   The Senate also voted 56-42 to adopt another Helms amendment
which could make it difficult or impossible for the Soviet Union
ever to occupy its new embassy here.
   The new U.S. Embassy in Moscow cannot be occupied because it is
riddled with Soviet eavesdropping devices. No decision has been
made on how to replace it.

   Leftist guerrillas exploded bombs
containing propaganda leaflets in the capital and two other cities,
wounding four people, Honduran news reports said.
   The leaflets said the six bombs that exploded Thursday were
planted by the May 9 Popular Liberation Forces, a leftist groups
not previously known, according to reports by radio station HRN and
Radio America.
   The leaflets said an internal struggle had developed in
Honduras' small guerrilla movement.
   Three bombs exploded in Tegucigalpa, with one wounding a
20-year-old student and a child as both walked through the city's
main plaza, the stations said. Two students suffered minor injuries
when another device went off in a garbage container at teacher's
college just outside the city, they said.
   Two others exploded at the National University in Tegucigalpa
and the coastal city of La Ceiba, 217 miles north of the capital.
   The other two went off at the teacher's college in San Pedro
Sula, 120 miles north of Tegucigalpa, according to the reports.
   The guerrilla communiques said that a ``fight to the death'' had
begun with the guerrilla movement and that the May 9 Popular
Liberation Forces had emerged from the division in the movement.
   It said it took its name from the day Cristobal Perez, 36, was
assassinated in 1986 when he was about to denounce corruption in
the Unified Workers' Federation, a leftist union of about 30,000
workers.

   The city that Neil Armstrong and Edwin ``Buzz''
Aldrin put on the map 20 years ago planned no official festivities
to mark the 20th anniversary of the astronauts' moon walk.
   Residents there are still trying to explain where they live.
   Before the moon walk, Moon, Va., was little more than a post
office and a bump in the road in Mathews County near the Chesapeake
Bay.
   You couldn't even find Moon on a Virginia road map.
   Today, the community of about 100 families isn't much bigger,
but at least it's on the map. The attention Moon attracted in 1969
when the Eagle landed on its celestial cousin apparently encouraged
the Virginia Department of Transportation to put it on the official
state map.
   Sometimes, even maps don't help.
   Pat Chalkley, a former Mechanicsville resident and relative
newcomer to Moon, said she sent her new address to a friend, who
replied with a note: ``Where in the hell is Moon?''
   Almost heaven, to hear Mrs. Chalkley and others describe their
community.
   ``I've heard people say that once you've seen a full moon over
the Chesapeake Bay, you never want to leave,'' said Mrs. Chalkley,
whose husband, Blanton, commutes 90 minutes to Richmond to work.
``I was sitting there the other night, looked up and saw this
absolutely gorgeous big ol' orange moon.''

   Its been 20 years since Neil Armstrong
put his historic footprint on the moon's surface, and Moonville
residents say they've waited that long for their adopted son to
visit them.
   Moonville adopted Armstrong as an honorary resident just before
he made his famous moon walk in 1969, and residents even had a
parade for him.
   But self-proclaimed Mayor Sam Peckinpaugh said the astronaut has
never been to this town, listed as Moonville on state maps and
called Moonsville by the 550 people who live here.
   If Armstrong did come, John Gunter would be the one to call.
   In 1969, Gunter, then a radio celebrity, told a joke about his
hometown that got out of hand.
   ``They're getting ready for the annual Fourth of July parade in
my hometown of Moonsville,'' he told listeners before signing off.
``It consists of a 1950 Buick with a sparkler on top!''
   More than 50 people called the station asking how to enter cars
and floats in Moonville's Fourth of July parade.
   ``I got a call saying Moonsville has to have a parade!'' Gunter
recalled.
   So the community did. And the timing was perfect.
   It was the month Armstrong was to lead the Apollo 11 mission on
the moon.
   Organizers decided to capitalize on the town's name and make
Armstrong an adopted son.
   Gunter served as grand marshal, and Neil Armstrong's brother,
Dean Armstrong, rode in the Buick with Gunter.
   Dean Armstrong told the crowd that after the moon landing, he
thought his brother, Neil, might come for a visit.
   Moonville residents are still waiting _ and hoping _ for that
visit.

   ``We're selling like a case a week. Usually we sell about a case
a month,'' Co-op salesman Harold Hayes said.
   A 10-ounce jar of the cream sells for $2.95 at the co-op. The

   Here is a list of other major plane crashes involving the
McDonnell-Douglas DC-10:
   
   March 3, 1974 _ A Turkish Airlines DC-10 crashes near Paris,
killing all 346 people aboard, after a rear cargo door blows out.
   The loss of the door led to decompression that buckled the floor
of the passenger cabin, which, in turn, severed hydraulic lines
essential to taking off, steering and landing.
   The crash was blamed on faulty cargo door design, which was
eventually altered after the crash and other non-fatal incidents of
door blowouts. Also, as a result of the crash, floors in
wide-bodied jets were strengthened and hydraulic lines rerouted.
   
   May 25, 1979 _ In the United States' worst air disaster, an
American Airlines DC-10 crashes near Chicago's O'Hare Airport,
killing 273 people. The airliner had just taken off when the engine
on its left wing tore away. The plane rolled into a severe left
bank and nosed over into the ground.
   Investigators said faulty maintenance caused the engine to come
loose and somersault over the wing, taking with it essential
hydraulic lines and control cables.
   The final accident report found the crash was caused primarily
by mistakes made by American Airlines maintenance crews but also
cited McDonnell-Douglas for defects in the design that made the
plane vulnerable to such damage.
   
   Oct. 31, 1979 _ A Western airlines DC-10 crashes at the
fog-shrouded Mexico City airport, killing 71 of the 88 people
aboard and three people on the ground. The plane mistakenly landed
on a runway closed for repairs, struck a parked dump truck and
careened into two buildings.
   
   Nov. 28, 1979 _ An Air New Zealand DC-10 loaded with South Pole
tourists crashes into Mount Erebus in Antarctica, killing all 257
people aboard. The plane apparently crashed as a result of a
navigational error while on a low-altitude swing past the volcano
as part of a round-trip sightseeing flight to the bottom of the
world and back.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Assault Weapons Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee has narrowly
approved a three-year ban on sales of nine military-style assault
weapons, despite heavy pressure from gun owners' organizations.
   ``It's designed to deny drug dealers the use of these types of
weapons,'' Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said Thursday following
the 7-6 approval.
   The measure would ban nine varieties of semiautomatic assault
weapons, five already covered by the Bush administration's import
ban and four others that are produced domestically.
   The bill also would provide for up to 10 years of additional
prison time for those convicted of crimes involving firearms.
   Critics called the measure too restrictive, although it was
modest in comparison with a flurry of bills introduced in February
following a mass slaying in a California schoolyard with a
semiautomatic assault rifle.
   ``I think it does a great deal of damage to the right of the
people to keep and bear arms,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told the
committee. Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the bill headed
in the right direction but should be stronger in banning assault
weapons.
   ``Frankly, it is a letdown to the law enforcement groups in
America,'' Metzenbaum said.

<NOTE>Congressmen Seek White House Meeting On Sea Turtle Decision</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Texas lawmakers are pressing for an emergency
meeting with President Bush to ask him to suspend regulations
requiring shrimpers to equip their trawls with devices designed to
protect endangered sea turtles.
   ``I'm as hot as a three-dollar pistol,'' Republican Rep. Tom
DeLay said Thursday after learning of the Commerce Department's
decision to enforce the regulations on turtle excluder devices, or
TEDs.
   The Coast Guard last week had suspended enforcement of the TEDs
regulations pending a review by Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.
   But on Thursday, the Coast Guard resumed enforcing the
controversial law after Mosbacher and Coast Guard commander Adm.
Paul A. Yost Jr. discussed the situation.
   Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the Commerce Department, said the
``regulations are the law and the secretary doesn't have much
flexibility in fiddling around with the law. He has to, under the
Endangered Species Act, protect the endangered sea turtles.''
   Gorman said the Commerce Department would continue to conduct
surveys to determine whether a reported invasion of seaweed is a
problem in clogging the TEDs.
   Rep. Solomon Ortiz, a Corpus Christi Democrat, claims seaweed
and other debris clog the TEDs and reduce a shrimper's catch by 17
percent to 35 percent.

   Nelson Bunker Hunt says even his brother's
Rolex watch was probably held as collateral by banks owed
substantial sums after the wealthy brothers' silver-buying binge
ended with the silver price collapse of March 1980.
   Hunt said he and his brothers were thrown into a
``straightjacket situation'' after their silver-buying spree that
began in 1973 culminated on Silver Thursday, the day in late March
1980 when silver prices fell from about $50 an ounce to around $10
an ounce.
   Once a billionaire, Bunker Hunt is in U.S. Tax Court challenging
$155 million in 1982 taxes the Internal Revenue Service says he
owes from the dissolution of a partnership set up to repay his
debts from the silver price collapse.
   Since then, Bunker and William Herbert Hunt have filed for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, as has
their family's flagship company, Placid Oil Co., founded by their
father, legendary wildcatter H.L. Hunt.
   The two have also been accused of trying to corner the silver
market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They also owe
more than $250 million in fines and interest to the Peruvian silver
mining company, Minpeco, stemming from a judgment in a lawsuit last
year.

   Survivors of United Airlines Flight 232 returned
to tearful reunions with relatives, their joy tempered by the
horrors of the fiery crash and thoughts of those who failed to
reach safety.
   ``We ordered a couple of shots of whiskey, sat there and talked
about how fortunate we are,'' said Garry Priest, 23, of Northglenn,
who returned on a flight from Sioux City, Iowa, with Bruce Benham
of Littleton.
   The pair arrived at Stapleton International Airport Thursday
holding a bottle of wine they had been given by United flight
attendants.
   At least 174 of the 293 people aboard survived when the DC-10 on
a flight from Denver to Chicago on Wednesday went out of control
during an emergency landing at Sioux Gateway Airport and crashed in
a twisting, flaming mass of wreckage.
   Benham and Priest had been flying to Chicago on business for
VICORP Restaurants in Denver, sitting in a middle section of the
jet. They said everyone in their section escaped serious injury and
wandered out together through a hole in the plane and into a
cornfield.
   Priest said when he got out of the wreckage the area looked
``like a war zone. Bodies, trash, magazines, luggage, and pieces of
bodies littered the area.
   ``I feel bad for the people that I saw on the runway and that
got caught,'' he said.
   He said he and several other passengers found an injured woman
outside the plane bleeding, and carried her several hundred yards
through tall stalks of corn to the runway.
   ``It was real organized. It really was,'' he said. ``Everybody
was just saying, `OK folks, let's take our time. Let's just walk
out,' and we did.''
   Benham, who had a bandaged arm, praised the pilot and the flight
attendants for being calm, relaxed ``and honest.''
   ``The whole thing seemed very unreal,'' said Benham, adding that
he was shocked by television footage he saw later of the plane
cartwheeling, because he did not remember such violence.
   Priest and Benham hugged crying family members after their
arrival.
   ``He looks terrific,'' Deborah Benham said of her husband. She
said the family planned to ``just relax. Period. We're going to go
somewhere without a phone.''
   Earlier, crash survivor Donna Treber of Westminster arrived at
Stapleton to meet her husband, Myron, who said she had not been
afraid to fly again. ``She said, `I just want to get on a plane and
come home,''' he said.
   But Dan McKelvey of Grand Junction said his family will never
fly again. He set out for Sioux City by car to pick up his wife,
Debbie; children Ryan, 7, and Devon, 5; and family friend Ruth
Pearlstein, all of whom escaped the crash without injury. Ryan was
stung by a bee as they ran through the cornfield from the plane.
   ``The plane had flipped and had broken apart in front of them
and they were hanging upside down,'' said McKelvey.
   Larry M. Hjermstad, 49, of Durango, his son, Eric, 12, and
daughter, Alisa, 8, were on their way to visit relatives in
Minnesota when the accident happened. Hjermstad's wife, Julie, flew
to Minneapolis Thursday with clothes to replace belongings
destroyed when the plane exploded.
   Alisa told her grandmother, Bobbie Ledgerwood, that she saw many
dead people and asked her mother not to fly, Ledgerwood said.
   Fred Hardman of Boulder said his wife and two children also
survived the flight without serious injury.
   Son Ryan, 14, said the family got out through a hole in the
plane's floor.
   ``It's just amazing, it was just there. If we had to go out
through a door, I don't think we would have made it,'' he said.
   His father said: ``From the time I heard the plane went down
till the time I knew they were alive was the tough part.''

<HEAD>Political Turmoil Opens Window On China's Crime Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's worsening crime problem has been getting
a more attention in the official press since troops crushed the
student-led protests for greater freedoms.
   In the nearly two months since Communist authorities suppressed
the pro-democracy movement, the number of reported arrests for
embezzlement, bribe-taking, smuggling, armed robbery and other
common crimes has multiplied.
   The government is apparently trying to satisfy popular
discontent over official corruption _ a chief target of
pro-democracy protesters.
   Reports of arrests of protesters, by contrast, have trickled
nearly to a halt, perhaps to avoid further international
condemnation.
   Although China's crime rate still is one of the lowest in the
world, in recent years the leadership has noted its rapid rise with
alarm.
   The government said early this year that the number of people
sentenced for crimes in 1988 was up 13 percent from the previous
year, at nearly 368,800.
   Rarely have the media devoted so much space and energy to crime
reports.
   In recent weeks, it has not been unusual to find three or four
reports of crime and corruption at all levels of government and in
all sectors of society in each of the nation's leading newspapers,
sometimes all on the front page.
   The number of cases and range of people involved _ from private
entrepreneurs to factory managers to high-ranking officials _ hints
at how pervasive crime and corruption is in Chinese society.
   On Thursday, the front-page of the People's Daily, the Communist
Party newspaper, carried two such reports.
   One said Shanghai authorities have in the year's first half
investigated 134 cases of economic crime involving more than 10,000
yuan ($2,700) each, an amount 100 times the average monthly salary.
   Sixty-four people have been arrested and 62 ounces of gold and
$682,300 in yuan and various foreign currencies confiscated, the
paper said.
   The other, much briefer report said that Guizhou provincial
authorities had uncovered a batch of large, important criminal
cases. It called for a thorough investigation but gave no details.
   On an inside page, the newspaper reported that two judicial
department workers were sentenced, one to eight and the other to
nine years, for seeking and accepting bribes totaling about $7,200
in cash and appliances.
   Many reports are careful to point out that investigations began
months before the student-led pro-democracy movement, which
authorities crushed June 4 when the army killed hundreds of unarmed
civilians in running protesters out of central Beijing.

   This Missouri River city opened its arms
to the survivors of United Flight 232 as residents offered their
time, blood and prayers to heal the wounds left by the fiery crash.
   ``I didn't get any sleep last night, but I don't think I'm going
to have any problem tonight,'' fire Capt. Terry Schmidt said late
Thursday. He had been at Sioux Gateway Airport around the clock
since the DC-10 jumbo jet crashed while trying to make an emergency
landing the day before.
   While crews stopped searching the wreckage and began to close
off the area, more than 300 people gathered at the Cathedral of the
Epiphany to pray for the victims and the survivors.
   ``The heroism, care, the concern, of the passengers and crew of
flight 232 was harvested in this sacred field,'' the Rev. Jerry
Cosgrove said of the cornfield where the plane came to rest.
   ``A field which became a tomb for far too many was also a cradle
of new life for others. A field became a sacred place.''
   Vacationing, off-duty and former employees of the city's two
hospitals pitched in to deal with the emergency.
   At times there were two doctors to every patient as survivors
were wheeled into emergency wards a dozen at a time, said Dr. David
Greco, chief of the emergency department at Marian Health Center.
He said people turned out in such numbers to give blood Wednesday
night that less than a third of it was needed for injured
passengers.
   ``I think there was a tremendous feeling of people wanting to do
something,'' said Les Horrell Jr., chamber of commerce president.
   Sioux City, a beef, pork and grain processing center, is a town
of 82,000 that sits on the east bank of a giant bend in the
Missouri River.
   ``Our chief of staff chartered an airplane and flew home from
vacation in Minnesota,'' said Sue Conner, spokeswoman for St.
Luke's Medical Center.
   ``We had offers of help from doctors and nurses at hospitals in
three states,'' she said. ``Several hospital burn units also
offered to send nurses or treat our patients.''
   At Marian, Vice President Andrew Allen said supplies arrived
from hospitals in Sioux Falls, S.D., and Omaha, Neb. ``We probably
got five months of inventory inside of three hours,'' he said.
   Nurses were handing out emotional support along with bandages,
said Jane Morgan of St. Louis, Red Cross health services officer
for the relief operation.
   ``They need someone to listen to them,'' Ms. Morgan said.
``Someone to go through the feeling they have _ the anger, the
grief, the guilt.''
   The Rev. Bob Condon, a Roman Catholic priest and psychology
professor at Briar Cliff College, where many survivors were put up
for the night, said the school was swamped with volunteers.
   ``People want to help in any way they can, so much so that is
was almost overwhelming,'' he said.
   Pat Kosse, a recent graduate of Briar Cliff, arrived Thursday
morning when the school already had more volunteers than it could
use. She ended up giving directions to news people and others on
campus.
   ``A lot of people's hearts are going out to the victims of the
crash. I couldn't believe that something like this happened in
Sioux City,'' she said.

   A bash for 10,000 past and present
NASA employees had the same open bar and mob scene as the parties
that followed Apollo missions 20 years ago.
   The only thing missing was the splashdown.
   ``Then, they threw everybody in the pool,'' said Cookie
Leisenring, a retired National Aeronautics and Space Administration
employee who was trying to take pictures of the honored guests at
Thursday's party at the Johnson Space Center _ Apollo 11 astronauts
Neil Armstrong and Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin and Michael Collins, who
marked the 20th anniversary of the first moonwalk.
   Leisenring recalled with pleasure the informal parties that
followed the Apollo splashdowns of the 60s and 70s.
   ``You knew everybody, the cars were parked on the medians and
you had to work to get up to the bar,'' Mrs. Leisenring said. ``All
the contractors had open bars at the hotels and you just walked up
and tried to make your way to get a drink. The parties were
everywhere.''
   One big party activity _ throwing others into the hotel swimming
pools _ wasn't possible Thursday. The Robert R. Gilruth Recreation
Facility has no pool.
   Separate outdoor areas of the party were designated for
different departments such as engineering and development and
recovery crew. Inside, a band played in a gym-sized room decorated
with star-shaped ballons and blue balloons with the U.S. flag on
them.
   Beer and soft drinks were free, but partygoers had to pay for
hot dogs.
   The crowds were so dense when the astronauts arrived at the
party that Space Center Director Aaron Cohen had to board a van
carrying the astronauts to officially greet them. Hans Mark, a
former director, also greeted the astronauts.
   ``Twenty years ago, I sat in mission control when these guys
came down and I wouldn't miss this for the world,'' said Mark, now
the chancellor for the University of Texas system.
   Collins, Aldrin and Armstrong, who earlier Thursday ate a
barbecue lunch with President Bush in Washington, D.C., exited the
van to loud cheers and then went separate ways to mingle with the
crowd.
   ``It is exciting to get to see all these guys that figured out
how to go to the moon in the first place,'' said Ken Schultz, an
engineer for Lockheed Engineering &amp; Science Co. Inc. ``I'm just
sitting here and going `Wow.'''
   On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin planted their footsteps
on the moon while Collins circled above in the spacecraft that
carried the three back to Earth.
   President Bush proposed Thursday to establish a U.S. moon base
early in the next century and then mount a manned Mars mission. His
proposal is likely to ignite a national debate in a budget-minded
Congress and among those who believe federal dollars should not be
spent on costly space endeavors but on solving more earthly
problems.
   After the splashdown party, the three former astronauts attended
a private party at a nearby hotel where they watched a fireworks
display that began at 9:56 p.m. _ the moment Armstrong stepped on
the moon two decades ago.

   The dollar closed marginally lower against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo today, while prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange rose.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 234.56
points, or 0.69 percent, ending the week at 33,899.43.
   With today's gain, the index has risen a total of 555.70 points
since Wednesday, following five days of losses totaling 403.04
points.
   The dollar closed at 142.15 yen, down 0.08 yen from Thursday's
close of 142.23 yen. After opening lower at 141.60 yen, the
currency began rising, ranging between 141.53 and 142.25 yen during
the day.
   A dealer with Mitsubishi Bank said participants bought dollars
in the afternoon session to make position adjustments.
   ``But many market players were unable to see a firm upward
direction for the dollar'' because of uncertainty over the outcome
of the nation's parliamentary elections on Sunday, said the dealer,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   She said the Bank of Japan stepped into the market to support
the yen on a small scale but it did little to brake on the dollar's
upward pressure in the afternoon session. The central bank does not
customarily comment on its market interventions.
   Several newspaper surveys predicted that the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party would suffer a heavy loss in Sunday's elections
for half the seats in the 252-member House of Councillors.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index shed 45.54 points during
the morning session, but many investors changed their minds in the
afternoon, traders said.
   ``Investors became bullish that share prices would remain strong
in the longer term,'' despite predicted losses for LDP candidates
in the elections, Yozo Asai of Yamaichi Securities said.
   Yamaichi said LDP losses in the elections had ``already been
taken account of by the market to some extent'' when the Nikkei
index fell for five consecutive trading days between July 12 and
July 18.
   ``There are not likely to be any specific factors that will
adversely affect the stock market between July and September so far
as (Japan's) economy is concerned,'' he added.
   Volume traded on the first section totaled 550 million shares,
compared to 500 million shares on Thursday.

   Prosecutors arranged a plea bargain
with a man linked to a cult ring that allegedly smuggled marijuana
and killed at least 15 people in rituals intended to magically
protect its operations.
   Serafin Hernandez Rivera, 45, pleaded guilty Thursday to
possession with intent to distribute 113 pounds of marijuana seized
in May 1987.
   Prosecutors will recommend dropping four other drug-related
charges against Hernandez, along with a firearms indictment, in
exchange for Hernandez' cooperation, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
John Crews.
   Hernandez Rivera was the only person arrested in the United
States in connection with the discovery of 15 bodies, many of them
horribly mutilated, near Matamoros, Mexico, in April.
   Hernandez was never accused in any of the killings.
   His son, brother and three other men are in jail in Matamoros on
murder and drug charges. Six other people have been jailed in
Mexico City, and another of Hernandez' brothers is a fugitive.
   Prosecutors also agreed not to seize Hernandez' Brownsville
home, indict him in connection with an alleged 75-kilogram cocaine
purchase last year, or recommend that the resident alien be
deported to Mexico.
   Crews would not say how Hernandez is expected to cooperate.
   Hernandez' attorney, Richard Hoffman, could not be reached for
comment Thursday.
   Crews said prosecutors would not oppose Hernandez' release on
bond. Hernandez faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced
Aug. 24.
   The firearms charge stems from the seizure of a sawed-off
shotgun during a search of Hernandez' residence after the discovery
of the bodies near Matamoros. Hernandez was arrested April 17 in
Houston.
   Ofoficials said the drug ring smuggled a ton of marijuana a week
into the United States.

   A man described in news reports as the sailor
who may have set off the USS Iowa blast in which he and 46
shipmates were killed said in letters to his girlfriend that the
Navy was his life.
   In a Dec. 1 letter to Charlene Meter, Gunner's Mate Clayton
Hartwig, 25, said he was not seeking a commitment from her because
of their different lifestyles and because he planned to re-enlist.
   ``I feel like an outsider, a visitor when I come `home,''' he
wrote. ``I don't know anyone but my family. I have no friends in
Cleveland, their all in the Navy.''
   Copies of 11 of Hartwig's letters were made available to The
Associated Press by his sister, Kathy Kubicina, of Cleveland. Ten
of the letters were to Ms. Meter and one was to Hartwig's parents.
   An unreleased Navy report says Hartwig, 25, may have set off the
April 19 gun turret blast that killed him and 46 others on the
battleship, NBC News and The New York Times reported this week.
   NBC reported Tuesday that a Navy investigation has ruled out
mechanical problems, accidental detonation or other technical
causes for the explosion.
   The investigators based their findings on an FBI psychological
profile of Hartwig and 228 other exhibits, including a three-hour
videotaped statement from an Iowa sailor who said he rejected
Hartwig's sexual advances, NBC said.
   A psychiatric study done by the FBI Center for Analysis of
Violent Crimes found that Hartwig was disturbed and under a lot of
stress, ``virtually insuring some type of reaction. In this
instance, it is suicide,'' according to the report.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the Navy's report is in
Norfolk, Va., on the desk of Vice Adm. Joseph S. Donnell III, the
commander of the Naval Surface Forces. The spokesman said the
report must go up the chain of command for review before being
submitted to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Navy sources said Thursday the report is expected to take
several more weeks to complete.
   Ms. Kubicina has rejected suggestions that the blast may have
been caused by sabotage by a suicidal Hartwig. Their father, Earl
V. Hartwig of Cleveland, said there was ``no way, definitely'' that
his son was suicidal.
   Ms. Kubicina said the letters she released show he was a normal
serviceman. She said that she earlier gave the originals to the
Navy in hopes of clearing his name.
   In letters to Ms. Meter, Hartwig wrote about their different
lifestyles and mentioned feelings of loneliness.
   ``For the last 6 yrs, all I've known is the Navy. I'm military
through and through and at times it's hard for me to get along with
civilians,'' he wrote in a Nov. 8 letter written from a ship off
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
   ``I guess it's like this. I have no idea what goes on in your
life in college,'' he continued. ``Your problems from day to day,
your frustrations, the people you can't stand, what you do. It's
the same for you with me. There's no way you could understand what
it's like to live in a cramped ship and be at sea for months at a
time.''
   Three days before the explosion, Hartwig again wrote to Ms.
Meter, from the Iowa in the Caribbean.
   ``I spent a lot of time outside today just watching the water go
by and thinking. It's really quite beautiful out hear if you stop
to notice,'' he wrote. ``We saw some whales swimming along in front
of the ship. The water is a bright royal blue and the sky was
crystal clear.''

   Ethnic extremists in a strife-torn region of
Soviet Georgia attacked a police station and armed guards at
several factories, seizing a large number of firearms, Tass
reported today.
   Forty-nine people were arrested in the Black Sea resort area on
Thursday night for curfew violations, and police confiscated more
than 200 weapons, the official news agency said.
   Special flights continued to evacuate thousands of tourists
stranded in the region, where six days of clashes between Abkhazian
and Georgian extremists have forced a halt in all road and rail
traffic.
   At least 18 people have been killed in the strife and 339
injured, including 30 police officers and and seven internal
security troops.
   ``In Kaspsky district, extremists attacked an Interior Ministry
department and stole 30 confiscated hunting guns,'' Tass said.
   ``In the town of Samtredia, armed guards were attacked in a
number of factories,'' the news agency said. ``Military firearms,
including automatic weapons, fell into the hands of extremists.''
   A spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Moscow said the
situation in Abkhazia, 800 miles south of Moscow, and nearby
regions remained tense.
   ``Tourists continue to be evacuated from the area,'' Tass said.
``Women and children are the first to leave and prompt action by
law enforcement forces ensured that there was not a single attack
on tourists.''
   Abkhazians are a minority in their homeland, a so-called
autonomous republic inside the republic of Georgia. Both Abkhazians
and Georgians claim ethnic discrimination by the other.
   Authorities declared the popular seaside resort of Sukhumi, the
Abkhazian capital, off-limits to millions of tourists who vacation
there each year. A state of emergency, including an 11 p.m.-to-6
a.m. curfew, was imposed in Abkhazia on Tuesday.
   Since the emergency measures were announced, police and troops
had seized more than 2,700 firearms.
   At least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest in the past month
in the Soviet Union's southern republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan.

   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher was in intensive care today after suffering a mild heart
attack, spokesmen said.
   The mass-circulation newspaper Bild quoted Genscher's main
spokesman, Juergen Chrobog, as saying the foreign minister will
probably require doctor's care ``for several weeks.''
   Another Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hanns Schumacher, said the
62-year-old Genscher was being treated in an intensive care unit of
a Bonn hospital: ``That is the usual procedure in a case like
this.''
   Schumacher said it was not known exactly how long the foreign
minister would remain hospitalized.
   Genscher complained of acute chest pains Thursday and was taken
to a Bonn hospital, where doctors determined he had suffered a mild
heart attack.

   Here is a summary of developments Thursday in the crash of
United Airlines Flight 232 at the Sioux Gateway Airport in Sioux
City, Iowa:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CASUALTIES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   At least 76 people were killed, and up to 43 others were missing
and believed dead.
   Rescuers said many of those unaccounted for probably were
trapped in a section of the charred fuselage.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SURVIVORS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   United said at least 183 survived among 293 people aboard the
aircraft. Jim Burnett, board member of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said there were 186 survivors and 295 passengers,
including a fourth person in the cockpit. City Manager Hank Sinda
put the number of survivors at 174, including the three working
cockpit crew members.
   Some survivors walked away from the wreckage.
   Dr. David Greco, one of the first physicians on the scene, said
the first-class section was devastated. Passengers in rows nine
through 19 suffered no injuries or minor ones, he added, but
``there was nothing left of the rear half of the aircraft.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PILOT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad visited Capt A.C. Haynes, the pilot, at
his bedside and told reporters: ``He was quite emotional about the
situation and tears came to his eyes when he talked about the
number of people who lost their lives. ... I told him he did a
valiant job.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CRASH SITE SEARCH</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators painstakingly searched the crash site, roughly the
length of three football fields.
   National Guardsman collected pieces of wreckage and carried body
bags to ambulances and refrigerated trailers.
   The flight voice and data recorders were recovered, taken to
Washington and found to be in good condition, said NTSB
aeronautical engineer Thomas Jacky. Their contents are unlikely to
be made public for several weeks.
   A piece of the plane roughly 8-by-12 feet was discovered in a
cornfield 55 miles east of Sioux City.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>POSSIBLE CAUSE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Aviation Administration authorities said the pilot first
reported ``uncontained engine failure,'' which means parts shot out
of the engine, possibly damaging other systems and causing what the
pilot later described as ``complete hydraulic failure.'' Spokesman
Bob Raynesford said the failure was in the tail engine, one of
three on the aircraft. The hydraulic system is routed through the
tail.
   Burnett said an entire fan-rotor system was missing from an
engine. ``That's the first time for this type of engine that we've
ever seen,'' he said. The jet's hydraulic system, which controls
wing and tail flaps and other key controls, contained no fluid at
landing, he said. The pilot had almost no control of the aircraft
during the last 34 minutes of the flight, he said.
   Investigators found several ``projectile penetrations,''
including a 10-inch-by-12-inch hole, in the horizontal stabilizer,
the small wing on the plane's tail, NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz
said. The rear engine sits just above the stabilizer.
   A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said the DC-10 is ``as fit as any
other'' airliner and has flown 745 million passengers safely more
than 7 billion miles.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PLANE'S HISTORY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   An FAA spokeswoman said records on problems with the jet show a
fairly good history, with two engine flameouts and some minor
problems with the landing gear.
   The 15-year-old plane had no accidents or reports of serious
incidents during the past five years.

<NOTE>SIOUX CITY</NOTE>

   Sioux City residents mobilized to help crash survivors while
volunteers and supplies poured into the town of 82,000.
   Vacationing, off-duty and former employees of the city's two
hospitals pitched in and local businesses and residents donated
food, clothing and toiletries.
   One man reported standing in a block-and-a-half line Wednesday
night to give blood. The Siouxland Blood Bank reported that 305
units of blood were available at the two hospitals, although less
than a third of that blood was needed.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities today released American
photojournalist Tony O'Brien six weeks after he was arrested in
Kabul in the company of anti-government guerrillas who brought him
into the country.
   ``I want to walk on the street,'' O'Brien, 43, of Santa Fe,
N.M., said moments after he was formally handed over to U.S.
consular officer Renny Smith, who had flown to Kabul from New Delhi.
   ``I want to thank the people of Afghanistan, the government of
the United States and (President) Najibullah,'' said O'Brien, who
had been on assignment for Time-Life Inc., covering the war from
the Pakistan border city of Peshawar.
   The photographer was arrested at a rebel hideout in the capital
on June 8 after entering the country without a visa.
   But he was never formally charged and the Soviet-backed
government agreed to release him after a personal appeal by PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   He is to fly home via New Delhi on Saturday.
   The Afghan government had demanded a formal letter from the
State Department requesting O'Brien's release and authorizing Ms.
Smith to escort him out of the country. Ms. Smith said she
delivered a letter and another one was sent by telex from
Washington direct to the Afghan government.
   The contents of the letters were not disclosed.
   ``They got what they wanted,'' she said without elaborating.
   Diplomatic sources said the government appeared to be using
O'Brien as a pawn in an effort to force the United States, which
backs the rebels, into issuing a statement that could be construed
as recognizing Najib's government as legitimate.
   A French photographer and an Italian photojournalist captured by
government forces were freed last year, but only after their
governments formally requested their release and dispatched senior
officials to Kabul.
   The clemency pleas by the French and Italian governments were
widely publicized by Kabul as a show of official international
recognition.
   The guerrillas, backed by the United States and based in
Pakistan, have been fighting to overthrow the Soviet-supported
government for 11 years.
   The United States and other Western nations closed their
embassies in Kabul in late January and early February, shortly
before Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan, ending a nine-year
military intervention.

   Government records on the United DC-10 that
crashed in Iowa ``are pretty clean'' with no major problems
reported in recent years, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
   The 15-year-old jumbo jet had no accidents or reports of serious
incidents during the past five years, the amount of time covered in
the agency's current records, according to Bobbie Mardis in the
FAA's Oklahoma City office.
   A separate FAA service difficulty report, covering 1980 to 1989,
showed two occasions when an engine on the jet flamed out, or quit,
during flight. No structural damage was evident in either case, Ms.
Mardis said Thursday.
   Connections cannot be immediately made between those engines and
the ones now on the plane because officials haven't identified the
serial numbers of the engines in Iowa, Ms. Mardis said.
   But she said the engines on the jet most likely are different
from those that experienced flameouts in 1980 and 1984, because
``they are replacing engines all the time.''
   She also said it is not uncommon for jets to experience engine
flameouts, and engines do not have to be replaced because of them.
   ``The report looks pretty clean,'' Ms. Mardis said.
   Officials in Sioux City reported late Thursday that the plane's
tail engine failed and an engine fan-rotor system was lost. The
plane's tail wing also sustained several ``projectile
penetrations,'' including one hole 10-by-12 inches, they said.
   Roland Herwig, a spokesman for the FAA center in Oklahoma City,
said it is ``complete hearsay at this point'' that the plane that
crashed had problems during an earlier flight Wednesday.
   A New Jersey woman said she took the same DC-10 from
Philadelphia to Denver Wednesday morning, and that as the plane
began to leave the terminal at Philadelphia International Airport
shortly after 10 a.m. ``everything sort of shut off.''
   The plane taxied back to the terminal, where it sat about 15
minutes for repairs before taking off, said Ruth Dinsmore of Mount
Laurel, N.J. Flight 232 was making the return trip from Denver.
   Herwig said no official has said there was a problem. ``We don't
even know if it was the same airplane,'' he said.
   United spokeswoman Kim Thomas in Chicago said she could not
confirm that the DC-10 had difficulty earlier in the day and would
not comment on maintenance records because they are ``material'' to
official investigations.
   The FAA's service difficulty records on the jet show problems
United has reported to the FAA. Airlines are required to submit
certain information about failures but sometimes submit more data
than is required so that the information can be used by others in
the aviation industry.
   The last engine flameout reported was in September 1984 when an
engine quit with 5,500 pounds of fuel in a tank and the aft boost
light on. The report said the problem could not be duplicated in
subsequent tests.
   In November 1980, an engine flamed out at 33,500 feet when the
drive shaft failed. The FAA records do not indicate how repairs
were made.
   The records also cite some minor landing gear problems,
including a July 1988 incident in which the crew reported the left
gear red light was on with the gear handle up. Some landing gear
position indicator parts had to be replaced, the report said.
   In January 1987, the flight crew reported it had no indication
that the landing gear was locked down, but the jet landed without
incident. Maintenance crews found the landing gear handle sticking
and lubricated the handle. The system checked out after that, the
FAA report shows.
   In June 1987, a right gear door cable was replaced after the
right main gear showed both a green and red light.

<HEAD>China Says It Won't Tolerate Democracy Campaign in Hong Kong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China said today it will not tolerate continued
support by Hong Kong residents for the mainland's crushed democracy
movement and that Hong Kong will be allowed to remain capitalist
only if it stops interfering.
   The warning was made in a strongly worded commentary in the
Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, that apparently was
written by a high-level official. It immediately triggered
widespread publicity in the tiny British colony, scheduled to
return to Chinese rule in 1997.
   ``We will not allow people to use Hong Kong as a base for
subverting the central people's government, this has been the
Chinese government's consistent policy,'' it declared.
   The commentary noted that China has promised the enclave can
remain capitalist for at least 50 years, but said: ``Not engaging
in activities to overthrow (the Chinese government) is a
precondition for allowing (Hong Kong) to retain its capitalist
system.''
   It also said any participation by Hong Kong residents in affairs
of the mainland would have to be in keeping with mainland laws.
   Hundreds of thousands of usually apolitical Hong Kong residents
joined in protest marches and petition drives after the June 3-4
army attack on pro-democracy student protesters in Beijing and
other Chinese cities.
   Many said the attack, followed by thousands of arrests, would
accelerate emigration from the colony.
   Chinese leaders have said they want to restore confidence among
Hong Kong residents. They assured prominent Hong Kong residents
invited to Beijing that China had not changed its policy of ``one
country, two systems'' after 1997.
   But the tone of the commentary, with its declaration that true
democracy can only be found under the socialist system, was likely
to have the opposite effect.
   ``This is the time to see how strong our backbone is,''
democracy activisit Szeto Wah, who was criticized in the
commentary, said on Hong Kong radio.
   The commentary singled out Szeto's group, the newly formed Hong
Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in
China, which has pledged $156,000 to help fugitives from the
mainland movement.
   Without mentioning them by name, the commentary accused Szeto
and the vice chairman of the group, Martin Lee, of supporting
independence for Hong Kong and plotting to overthrow the Communist
government.
   Szeto denied the charge, saying he opposed China's current
leaders but not socialism. He and Lee are members of a joint Hong
Kong-Chinese committee that is drafting a basic law to govern Hong
Kong after 1997.
   ``(The Chinese leaders) know that we have popular support, and
this is their way, their devious way ... of persuading people not
to join us out of fear,'' Lee said on Hong Kong radio.
   Another alliance leader, Lee Wing-tat, said the commentary would
not deter his group from sending funds to Chinese fugitives in
France who have announced plans to form a democratic coalition.
   The People's Daily essay was signed by a pseudonym, Ai Zhong,
that sounds the same as the words ``love China.''
   Several major commentaries have appeared in the People's Daily
in recent days under pen names, apparently the word of top-level
officials.
   Such a practice has not been common since the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, a violent far-leftist campaign that has had eerie
echoes in the current crackdown on dissent.
   Another similarity is in the emphasis on ideology over economic
development, which had been the main concern of the past decade.
   At a meeting of propaganda officials from around the country,
party General Secretary Jiang Zemin called for ``100 percent
emphasis'' on ideological work.
   Other officials called for ``strict adherence to party
propaganda discipline.'' Speeches from the meeting were blazoned on
front pages today.
   Other commentaries emphasized that class struggle has not ended,
and said advocates of Western-style liberalism are class enemies.
   In another development, China's leading dissident, Fang Lizhi,
who is hiding in the U.S. Embassy, has been expelled from his posts
in the Dialectics Research Society, the official Xinhua News Agency
said.
   Fang, an astrophysicist, worked in the Beijing Observatory, but
repeated phone calls to determine if he had been fired as well were
not answered.

<HEAD>Top Opposition Leaders Under House Arrest</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two leaders of Burma's major
opposition party are under house arrest for trying to ``revive
anarchy'' and destroy the military, the government announced today.
   The confinements of Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo could last one
year and then be renewed, officials told a news conference. They
also indicated that opposition parties could be disqualified from
participating in elections next year.
   ``They will be held as long as the dangers of disruption of
peace and tranquility by them exist,'' said Col. Aung Thein, when
asked if Ms. Suu Kyi and Tin Oo will be able to run in the
elections.
   The government of Gen. Saw Maung promised the elections not long
after crushing a nationwide pro-democracy movement in September.
   During those protests, Ms. Suu Kyi, the daughter of national
independence hero Aung San, sided with students and others
demanding an end to authoritarian rule. She is now secretary of the
National League for Democracy, and Tin Oo, a retired general, is
the chairman.
   Both have been outspoken in their criticism of the military
government and martial law.
   Aung Thein, a member of the government's Information Committee,
said the government may prohibit the National League for Democracy
or any other group from participating in the general election. ``We
will consider it if the party or parties continue the excesses,''
he said.
   Government spokesman Kyaw Sann said Ms. Suu Kyi and Tin Oo are
prohibited from having contact with people outside their homes.
Family members of the two may leave their residences ``under
surveillance'' but may not contact foreign embassies, political
parties or people connected with the parties, he said.
   ``Action has to be taken for their repeated attempts to divide
the military and the people and also to cause disunity among the
military,'' Kyaw Sann said. ``Both of them mounted their incitement
in the last two months, finally using confrontational strategy to
destroy the military and revive anarchy in the country.''
   The government did not say when the two were arrested, but
reports from a Western embassy in Rangoon said on Thursday that
troops had surrounded Ms. Suu Kyi's house in a suburb of the
capital, Rangoon. When she tried to surrender to the soldiers, they
forced her back inside her residence, the embassy said.
   Later that day, the State Department said in Washington that the
arrests of opposition activists ``cast serious doubts'' on the
government's intention to hold free elections. It called on Burmese
authorities to release all political prisoners and allow the
opposition to campaign for the election.
   The government has threatened violators of martial law decrees
with death sentences.
   On Wednesday, hundreds of students defied martial law to hold
anti-government demonstrations. Ms. Suu Kyi canceled her planned
rally to avoid clashes with soldiers who filled the streets. State
radio reported 44 arrests.

<TEXT>
   A Briton convicted of drug trafficking
was hanged in prison today and spent his last hours clutching a
photograph of his 7-year-old daughter, authorities said.
   Derrick Gregory, arrested with more than a pound of heroin, was
the first Briton to be executed under Malaysia's stringent
14-year-old drug law that deems a trafficker to be anyone carrying
more than a half ounce of heroin.
   Authorities ignored pleas from British diplomats that he be
spared.
   Gregory clutched the photo of his daughter, Tara, through the
night until he was marched to the gallows early today, authorities
said.
   Gregory, 39, had not seen his daughter since she was an infant.
   He was arrested in 1982 at a Malaysian airport with the heroin
hidden in his boots. At the trial, the court in Penang was told
Gregory had 14 packets of the drug in his boots and four packets in
his underwear. He was arrested just before he planned to board a
plane for Singapore en route to Los Angeles.
   His wife divorced him soon after he was sentenced to death in
1987.
   Gregory, of Middlesex, England, was turned down in his final
appeal for clemency by the Penang State's Pardons Board last week.
   Gregory's parents, Kenneth and Mary Gregory, and his brother,
Paul, visited him Thursday at the Kajang jail, 10 miles south of
Kuala Lumpur.
   Reporters saw them come out in tears, and they went straight to
the airport and flew home to England.
   Prison officials said only an executioner, physician and
magistrate were present at today's hanging.
   Gregory had sent letters to Queen Elizabeth asking her to
intercede, but British diplomats said it was not common practice
for the queen to interfere in such matters.
   However, the first secretary at the British Embassy in Kuala
Lumpur, Ashe Wyndham, said his government ``had hoped that the
representation made at all levels to the Malaysian authorities,
making a plea for commutation of the death sentence on humanitarian
grounds, would succeed.
   ``We are disappointed that they have not, and offer our sympathy
to the family of Derrick Gregory,'' he added.
   Gregory was the first Briton sentenced to death and hanged under
Malaysia's stringent 1975 drug laws. Australians, Singaporeans,
Filipinos, Thais and Indonesians have also hanged for drug
trafficking.
   Under Malaysian law, anyone caught in possession of more than
half an ounce of heroin is deemed a trafficker.
   The government has said Malaysia implemented the strict laws
because the drug problem was the country's ``No. 1 enemy.'' About
350,000 of Malaysia's 17 million people are thought to be drug
addicts.
   Since Parliament passed the laws, 221 people have been sentenced
to death for trafficking. Eight-one, including Gregory, have hanged.

   A Turkish native once employed by the U.S.
Army as a mechanic in West Berlin was could be sentenced to 30
years to life in prison for conspiring to sell secrets to the
Soviet Union and East Germany.
   Huseyin Yildirim, 61, was in jail today after being convicted by
a U.S. District Court jury Thursday of one count of conspiracy to
commit espionage.
   U.S. District Judge B. Avant Edenfield ordered a pre-sentence
investigation for before he sets the prison term for Yildirim.
   The defendant, a civilian mechanic for the Army, was accused of
working with an American warrant officer to sell information from
the National Security Agency's Field Station Berlin from 1983 to
1988. The plot is said to have caused serious damage to American
intelligence work because the station conducts electronic
eavesdropping on telephone and other communications.
   Yildirim, of Belleair Beach, Fla., was charged with conspiring
with Warrant Officer James William Hall III, who pleaded guilty in
a court-martial and was sentenced to 40 years in prison.
   Defense attorney Lamar Walter said he would file a motion for a
new trial within a week.
   Yildirim also did not testify, and the defense presented no
evidence. In his closing statement, Walter told the jury that Hall
was solely to blame for the espionage.
   The trial was held in Savannah because Hall was stationed at
nearby Fort Stewart at the time of his arrest last December.

   Twelve former Tamil guerrillas took
their seats in Parliament today, ending a five-month boycott by
disavowing a separatist campaign to divide this troubled island
nation.
   ``We come here today in the hope of using Parliament as a forum
to propagate on behalf of the Tamil people, although we do not
think Parliament can resolve the ethnic problems of this country,''
said Eliyathamby Ratnasabapathy, of the Eelam Revolutionary
Organization of Students.
   Tamil rebels have been fighting the Sinhalese-dominated
government for six years. Violence by Sinhalese radicals opposed to
a plan to grant regional autonomy to Tamils has left more than 470
people dead in recent weeks, the government said Thursday.
   Ratnasabapathy was among 13 members of the opposition party
elected to the 225-seat Parliament. The 13th did not attend today's
session, colleagues said, because he could not arrive on time. They
did not elaborate.
   The opposition party, known as EROS, won its seats in the Feb.
15 general election. The legislators boycotted the session,
demanding the government release Tamil political prisoners, hold
peace talks with the most militant guerrillas and abolish an
amendment to the constitution requiring lawmakers to take an oath
disavowing the division of the island along ethnic lines.
   Ratnasabapathy said the group was satisfied the government met
most of its demands.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa's government opened peace talks
with the Tamil Tigers on May 4, the first direct contact since the
insurgency began six years ago, and ordered the release of hundreds
of Tamil political prisoners. The constitutional amendment,
however, was not abolished.
   EROS is widely believed to be closely linked with the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest and most militant of the Tamil
groups waging a campaign for a separate nation in the north and
east.
   Ratnasabapathy and the other EROS members joined Parliament as
it was debating whether to extend the state of emergency imposed a
month ago to try to curb ethnic violence. ``Emergency laws are not
going to solve any problems of the people. The government will have
to use democratic methods to bring about a solution,'' he said.
   The emergency laws had been in effect from 1983 until January
1989, when Premadasa took office and lifted the state of emergency.
But the killings continued, and the emergency was reimposed June 20.
   Sinhalese radicals trying to overthrow the government killed 472
people in recent weeks, despite a tough new crackdown by security
forces, an official said. Vincent Perrera, minister for
parliamentary affairs, said Thursday that the killings occurred
from June 21 to July 15.
   Most deaths since July 6 had not been previously reported
because of government censorship of news reports. In addition to
censorship, the government gave security forces sweeping powers,
including shoot-on-sight orders, to quell the radical movement.
   Perrera also said that 70 people were killed in the
Tamil-dominated north and east during the same period. He did not
name the suspected assailants.
   Sinhalese militants operate mainly in the center and south of
the island.
   Tamil rebels began fighting for a separate country in 1983,
prompting the start of the emergency laws.
   In 1987, the Sinhalese-dominated government offered the rebels
limited autonomy in exchange for a surrender of arms, but the
Tigers rejected the plan and began fighting Indian soldiers who had
been sent to enforce it.
   The agreement also caused a backlash from Sinhalese hard-liners
who began attacking the government, saying it was giving too many
concessions to the minority Tamils. The two conflicts have left at
least 15,000 people dead.

   A Philippine Airlines plane carrying
98 people today overshot a runway, plowed into a concrete wall and
bounced onto a highway, killing at least eight people on the
ground, officials said.
   The dead were crushed in their cars when the twin-engine BAC
1-11 jet careened onto Manila's 12-lane South Expressway, said
witnesses and officials at nearby hospitals. The plane then came to
rest on a railroad track.
   Airline spokesman Enrique Santos said 91 people were injured,
four critically. The critical injuries occurred on the ground,
Santos said. Eighty-five people on the plane, including two crew
members, were hurt, he said.
   Santos said the plane was arriving in Manila from Zamboanga
City, 540 miles southeast of the capital, when it crashed at about
3:23 p.m. (3:23 a.m. EDT).
   Air traffic controllers said the pilot, Capt. Ricardo Misa,
reported that visibility was poor because of heavy rain and that he
could see only half the runway as he approached.
   ``It was raining at the time, but weather conditions were above
the minimum for landing, so he was cleared to land,'' Santos said.
``He landed and he ran out of runway.''
   The aircraft overshot the runway, hit the ground, crashed
through a concrete highway wall and bounced across the road.
   ``We came down and went up again about 150 feet. Then we went
down again very steeply,'' said passenger Beverly Spilman, a
British teacher who works in Austria and is vacationing in the
Philippines. ``I did see we were nearing the end of the runway .. .
then we hit the highway, plowed through a railroad track and landed
on the opposite side of the highway.''
   Spilman, who spoke to reporters at the Manila airport clinic,
suffered minor cuts.
   ``We landed, three, four, five, six times on the runway. We were
actually bouncing,'' said David Tillson, a tourist from Tacoma,
Wash.
   Another passenger, Roberto Mendoza, cried as he recounted in a
radio interview how he thought he was going to die.
   ``People started shouting. We were expecting that at any moment
the plane would explode,'' he said. ``When it stopped, the windows
shattered and I jumped out. I thought I landed on the wings but
then I found out it was the roof of a house.''
   Part of the belly of the British Aircraft Corp. jet was ripped
open.
   Officials closed the highway to facilitate the rescue operation,
which was hampered by the heavy rain and traffic jams on streets
leading to the scene.

<HEAD>Aoun Admits Receiving Weapons from Iraq, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper today quoted army commander
Gen. Michel Aoun as saying that Iraq has provided him with weapons,
but he refused to say if Iraq has given him medium-range missiles
as alleged by Syria.
   Aoun, whose mainly Christian troops are engaged in a
long-running battle with Syrian gunners, has publicly thanked Iraq
in the past for its support, but he has never admitted receiving
weapons from Iraq.
   According to police, the casualty toll in the 18-week-old
confrontation stood at 434 dead and 1,784 wounded following
overnight fighting that killed one person and injured four.
   In south Lebanon, meanwhile, the United Nations said a U.N.
peacekeeping soldier was seriously wounded today when unidentified
assailants attacked peacekeeping troops.
   ``Brotherly Iraq supports Lebanon ... I wanted to purchase
weapons and ammunition, and Iraq donated them,'' the daily paper
An-Nahar quoted Aoun as saying in an interview.
   The Maronite general said Iraq has given his army
Soviet-designed T-55 tanks and ``other types of weapons.''
   He would not say if Iraq has provided him with medium-range,
frog-7 surface-to-surface missiles, which would be able to hit the
Syrian capital, Damascus.
   Syria claims Aoun possesses these missiles and has demanded they
be removed from the 310-square-mile Christian enclave, which is
under the control of Aoun's troops and the right-wing Christian
Lebanese Forces militia.
   ``The missiles issue is not the problem. The problem is the
Syrian presence in Lebanon,'' Aoun was quoted as saying.
   Aoun denied charges by Syria's government-run radio that Iraq
sent military personnel to help his troops.
   ``Every time, they claim that there are Iraqi soldiers or
experts in Lebanon. Where are thay? Iraq does not put strings on
our political, military and economic decision-making,'' Aoun said.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, has 40,000 troops deployed in the
war-shattered nation. It supports Aoun's ``war of liberation'' to
drive out the Syrians.
   Syrian troops first entered Lebanon in 1976 as part of an Arab
League peacekeeping force. The Syrians initially sought to curb
violence among Moslem factions but later sided with Moslems against
the Christians.
   The current round of violence broke out March 8, two days after
Aoun blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of
Beirut to salvage about $100 million in customs dues lost annually.
   Police said intermittent overnight duels covered the mountainous
range southeast of the capital and the Christian-controlled
coastline to the north.
   In southern Lebanon, Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N.
peacekeeping forces, said a ``large group of armed elements'' fired
three rocket-propelled grenades at a checkpoint manned by Fijian
peacekeeping soldiers in the village of Siddiqine. He said the
attack developed into a 20-minute clash and that a Fijian soldier
lost his eye.
   The mainstream Shiite moslem Amal militia, which is the dominant
force in south Lebanon, is investigating to determine who attacked,
Goksel said.
   The 5,800-strong U.N. force, drawn fromn nine nations, has been
deployed in south Lebanon since Israel's 1978 invasion.
   France, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Ghana, Fiji, Ireland, Nepal and
Finland all have troops in the force.

   A Cambodian refugee camp run by
communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas came under heavy shelling today
that killed one refugee and wounded 10, Western relief officials
said.
   One official said 27 shells crashed into the Site 8 camp in
Thailand near the Cambodian border. The three hours of shelling
followed overnight fighting in the area, said a Thai security
official.
   The U.N. Border Relief Operation declared the camp off limits to
relief personnel for safety reasons.
   Site 8 houses 40,000 refugees and is the main civilian camp
operated by the Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla group fighting
Vietnamese occupation forces and allied Cambodian government troops.
   Western relief officials said it appeared that Vietnamese-backed
government forces staged the attack.
   In the past, the Khmer Rouge has shelled its own camps in
macabre attempts to exercise strict control over the refugees or to
reduce their population. Widespread human rights violations have
been reported in the camps.
   The camp of thatched houses is in Thailand's eastern province of
Prachinburi and about a mile from the Cambodian border.
   Fighting between pro-Vietnamese forces and the Khmer Rouge has
increased along the border in recent days, as often is the case
before diplomatic events and peace talks.
   The Khmer Rouge and the other guerrilla groups are to hold talks
with the Vietnamese-installed government in Paris next week, then
attend an international conference on Cambodia starting July 30.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and toppled the brutal Khmer
Rouge regime. The Khmer Rouge were in power from 1975-1978.
Hundreds of thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people died from
Khmer Rouge executions, famine and civil unrest.

   Searchers with dogs scoured the
flood-washed banks of a northern Virginia creek today for a car
with up to three people seen floating away in high water that
claimed the life of a pregnant woman.
   Water in Goose Creek rose 13 feet in half an hour during heavy
rain Thursday, washing about 10 cars off a bridge on U.S. 17.
   Three people were rescued from the creek and eight others
managed to escape on their own, said Lt. Donald Flohr of the
Fauquier County Sheriff's Department.
   Tammy Woolf Conneway of Bloommerry, W.Va., died in the flood,
Flohr said.
   Several witnesses reported seeing a car with up to three people
in it floating away.
   On Thursday, more than 100 military personnel and rescuers,
including divers, searched for the car.
   More rain forced searchers to quit at 5 p.m. Thursday, but the
resumed the effort today.
   ``A trucker along Route 17 and two people stranded on the roof
of their car saw a small red car float past them with as many as
three people in it,'' Flohr said.
   Ms. Conneway, alone in a pickup truck, was on her way home from
a job with the state Department of Corrections in Fairfax County,
when the truck was washed off the bridge, Flohr said. He said she
was four months pregnant.
   The creek, which normally runs about 10 feet below the bridge,
rose an estimated 13 feet in 30 minutes, said Thompson, director of
county emergency services. The flood waters later receded, he said.

<HEAD>Three Pirates Who Killed 56 Vietnamese Boat People Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested three Thai fishermen
who confessed they killed 56 Vietnamese boat people by attacking
them with knives, sticks and axes and throwing them into the sea,
an officer said today.
   The men were arrested Tuesday after they were identified by the
only two survivors of the March 26 attack, said Lt. Col. Prakob
Benjapong of Marine Police in the southern fishing port of Songkhla.
   Boat captain Boonrub Ruangdit, 27, and Vichoke Wongkan, 29, and
Amnuay Saenghiran, 19, then made confessions, said Prakob.
   According to Prakob, the fishermen said they robbed the
Vietnamese then transferred 10 women to their boat.
   They called the Vietnamese men onto the deck one by one, struck
them in the head and legs and threw them overboard, Prakob said.
They later killed the women in a similar fashion.
   Prakob said the fishermen towed the Vietnamese boat from the
area and sailed around for an hour to make sure all the victims
died.
   The survivors, Pham Hgoc Van, 33, and Do Hoa, 14, reached a
refugee camp in Malaysia.
   Police are seeking about six other fishermen believed involved
in the attack, said Prakob.
   Attacks on Vietnamese boat people, who sometimes flee with gold
and other valuables, have become increasingly violent in the past
year and have left scores if not hundreds dead this year.
   Last month, police said four other Thai fishermen were arrested
and confessed to killing 130 Vietnamese refugees on April 16 off
the Malaysian coast.
   The threat of pirates, prison-like refugee camps, and days at
sea without food and water have not discouraged the exodus of
Vietnamese. More than 1.5 million have left their homeland since
the communist takeover in April 1975.
   Nations such as Hong Kong that are overwhelmed by the exodus say
most of the refugees now are fleeing economic hardship, not
political persecution.

   The military in Somalia summarily executed
46 men after 400 people were killed in clashes that began when
troops fired on Moslem worshipers there, a human rights group and
independent sources said today.
   The executed men were among an estimated 2,000 people arrested
in house-to-house searches after the disturbances one week ago in
the Somali capital, Mogadishu, said the human rights group, Africa
Watch.
   The group said the men were rounded up two days after the
unrest, taken to a beach just outside Mogadishu, and shot to death.
   Africa Watch and other sources put the number killed during the
July 14 violence at around 400. Somalia's government previously
said 23 people died and 59 were injured in the unrest, which it
blamed on ``troublemakers.''
   Africa Watch and the other sources said many of those who were
slain died when military vehicles armed with .50-caliber machine
guns opened fire on houses in heavily populated residential
districts.
   The human rights group said more than 1,000 people were injured.
   Africa Watch, with offices in London and Washington, released
its statement in Nairobi. The independent sources spoke on
condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisals.
   Mogadishu residents contacted by telephone said that aside from
isolated gunfire that continued a day after the riots, there had
been no further violence in Mogadishu.
   Africa Watch and the independent sources said the violence broke
out after the July 13 arrests of four Moslem leaders and an
unspecified number of civilians. They said armed detachments
surrounded Mogadishu's major mosques in anticipation of protests
and tried to disperse worshipers as they left the mosques following
prayers.
   Soldiers then opened fire on the worshipers, who fought back
mainly with rocks and stones, the human rights group said. In at
least one neighborhood, worshipers who outnumbered security forces
seized their weapons and returned fire, the rights group said.
   The army moved into the city with tanks and took over major
government buildings and stategic roads, according to Africa Watch.
   Witnesses reached by telephone said that at one point a mob
screaming ``Allahu Akbar!'' Arabic for God is great, made log
roadblocks to stop military vehicles mounted with machine guns and
firing at random in city streets.
   Throughout that evening and the next night, soldiers went from
house to house arresting men, raping women and looting property,
witnesses said.
   The violence also appeared linked to the slaying of Mogadishu's
Roman Catholic Bishop, Salvatore Colombo, on July 9 by an
unidentified gunman. The bishop was an Italian citizen who had
lived in Somalia for more than 40 years.
   Africa Watch reported widespread suspicion in Mogadishu that
Colombo's death was ordered by government forces who suspected him
of relaying information about human rights abuses to foreign
governments.
   Moslem leaders are said to have been angry the government
offered a $13,000 reward for information about his killing because
they felt officials generally showed little concern for the welfare
of Somalis, Africa Watch reported.
   Some residents reported a recent upsurge in anti-Christian and
anti-white feeling in the capital and said Colombo was suspected of
trying to convert Moslem youth.
   The reports were difficult to verify because the government has
barred journalists from visiting Somalia since heavy fighting broke
out between government forces and the northern rebel Somali
National Movement in May 1988.
   Islam is the state religion in the poor, pastoral East African
nation of 6 million. There are about 2,000 Catholics.
   The autocratic President Mohamed Siad Barre has ruled Somalia as
a one-party state since 1969.

   A Dutch reporter detained with more than
100 Greek Cypriot women protesting the 15-year Turkish occupation
of northern Cyprus said today that riot police beat demonstrators
and poked them with electric prods.
   ``It was such a madhouse there with the horrible Turkish army
hordes charging at us with their batons and rifles,'' said Hetty
Lubberding, a correspondent for Dutch radio. ``Their behavior ...
was brutal.''
   She also said organizers of the protest by hundreds of women
were partly responsible for provoking the Turkish response
Wednesday night. She said the organizers chose a highly sensitive
area to enter the buffer zone between the war-divided sections of
the capital and that they displayed the Greek flag.
   In Ankara today, the Turkish government said the U.N.
peacekeeping force watching the zone did not do enough to prevent
protesters from knocking down barbed wire barricades and occupying
a destroyed school and church in the zone.
   ``We have difficulty understanding the failure of the
peacekeeping force to take the necessary measures and the
unprecedented tolerance shown to the violation of the buffer
zone,'' a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said.
   Ms. Lubberding said police used electric prods on demonstrators,
beat and slapped them and pulled their hair.
   Turkish Cypriot police arrested 111 people in the protest. Three
foreign reporters, including Ms. Lubberding and an American, were
released Thursday.
   The remaining 108 people arrested, including 10 men, remained on
the Turkish side today where they were being processed through the
courts.
   Akis Fantis, spokesman for the Greek Cypriot government, said
President George Vassiliou intensified his efforts today through
diplomatic contacts for their release.
   Turkish Cypriots in 1983 declared the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus in the northern third of the island, which only
Turkey recognizes.
   The women's march was part of a series of demonstrations marking
the 15th anniversary of the Turkish invasion five days after a coup
by supporters of uniting the island with Greece. About 30,000
Turkish troops guard the area.
   The American reporter released Thursday was Katherine McElroy, a
correspondent for the Reuters news agency, who holds both Cypriot
and U.S. passports. She was not immediately availabe for comment.

   The family of pilot Thomas Root hopes
extensive medical and psychological tests will help solve the
mystery of his 800-mile odyssey, which may be linked to a prior
blackout, Root's brother said.
   ``We would like a full medical evaluation,'' Todd Root said
Thursday. ``We want to make sure there's not more to this than just
an accident. Our family is interested in only one thing: getting to
the bottom of what may have caused this and getting my brother the
proper treatment.''
   Thomas Root, a 36-year-old communications lawyer in Washington,
D.C., blacked out in his office in March, but doctors could not
find an explanation after three days of tests, his brother said.
   ``Maybe there is some link from that incident to this one,'' he
said.
   Thomas Root has said he blacked out two hours after taking off
from Washington National Airport en route to Rocky Mount, N.C.,
July 13.
   His flight continued on autopilot, while military rescue planes
followed, until he ditched in Bahamian waters. It was then
discovered that he had been shot in the abdomen with a .32-caliber
pistol. He claims it discharged by itself from the plane's glove
box.
   ``I want to believe it's an accident,'' Todd Root told
reporters. ``Yet I know the circumstances surrounding this are so
mysterious that it's hard for the general public and anyone not to
believe there might be more to it.''
   Todd Root said his brother was running a fever and was advised
by doctors and relatives not to meet with reporters.
   Hospital spokeswoman Linda Hamlin refused to comment on
scheduled tests for Root.
   ``Tom Root's brother made statements about the test,'' said Ms.
Hamlin. ``He is an intelligent man and seemed to know what he is
talking about.''
   In Miami, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen
confirmed that Lehtinen requested reports on the FBI interrogation
of Root.
   A source close to the investigation said it probably would
examine whether Root filed false information about his flight or is
liable for search and rescue expenses.

<HEAD>OAS Asks Noriega to Transfer Power in Six Weeks</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Recasts lead and inserts new 4th graf, The declaration, to clarify
terms of declaration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Organization of American States foreign
ministers are asking Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to arrange a
transfer of power over the next six weeks as part of a plan to
restore democratic rule in Panama.
   A declaration approved by the ministers Thursday was a
masterpiece of diplomatic evenhandedness, earning the support of
both the U.S. delegate and Noriega's representative.
   Specifically, the declaration said the proposed transfer of
power on Sept. 1 and subsequent free elections are to be carried
out through ``democratic means and in conformity with existing
internal Panamanian procedures.''
   The declaration lacks an enforcement mechanism and does not
specifically ask for Noriega to step down. Advocates of a stronger
statement expressed concern that he might try to rig the process in
a way that enables him to maintain control from his power base as
commander of the Panamanian Defense Force.
   Privately, U.S. officials expressed dismay with the outcome but
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger indicated in brief
remarks that the declaration has enough teeth to warrant U.S.
backing.
   Addressing delegates from the 31-member body assembled at the
ornate OAS headquarters, Eagleburger said the transfer of power
envisioned in the declaration ``must reflect the will of the
Panamanian people.''
   In addition, the new democratic elections called for must not be
held in ``one, two or three years but as soon as possible,''
consistent with the wording of the declaration, he said.
   ``General Noriega must go,'' Eagleburger added.
   The United States has called for the OAS to exert maximum
pressure on Noriega, who has been accused by two Florida grand
juries of drug smuggling activities.
   The ministers also extendeduntil Aug. 23 the mandate of an OAS
mediating team which has been trying to facilitate an end to the
two-month old political crisis in Panama.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter pledged his
government's full cooperation with the mediating team, which is
comprised of the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and
Trinidad and which has received the cooperation of OAS Secretary
General Joao Baena Soares.
   According to the Panamanian constitution, a new president is to
be installed Sept. 1. The Bush administration had hoped the OAS
would push for the installation as president of the opposition
candidate in the May 7 national elections.
   The results of that balloting were thrown out by Panama's
electoral tribunal amid widespread claims that Guillermo Endara,
the candidate opposed to Noriega, had won in a landslide.
   By calling for another round of elections after Sept. 1, the
OAS, in effect, accepted as permanent the annulment of the May 7
balloting.
   The reference to the need to abide by ``existing internal
Panamanian procedures'' also was seen as a concession to Noriega.

   Investigators probing the destruction of
United Flight 232 focused today on the plane's tail section and
rear engine, which apparently exploded in flight.
   A severe engine explosion may have destroyed the hydraulic
system that powers primary control mechanisms on the triple-jet
DC-10 that crashed Wednesday at Sioux City, Iowa, James Burnett of
the National Transportation Safety Board said on ``CBS This
Morning.''
   But, he said on NBC's ``Today'' show, ``we have to assemble a
lot more information before we'll even get close to the cause of
this accident.''
   ``There was a severe explosion, enough that the flight
attendants fell to the floor,'' Burnett told a news conference late
Thursday. ``There was severe vibration of the aircraft. The chief
flight attendant went into the cockpit, found the flight crew
struggling with the controls.''
   The crew then began preparing the passengers for an emergency
land, he said.
   NTSB investigators were attempting to recover remaining pieces
of the engine, whose parts were flung up to 60 miles ahead of the
emergency landing site.
   Burnett said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that eight groups
of investigators were working in Sioux City, with others traveling
to Minneapolis to interview air traffic controllers who
communicated with the flight and to San Francisco to look at
maintenance records for the aircraft.
   In Washington, safety board engineers and scientists were going
over tapes from the cockpit voice recorder and the plane's digital
data recorder, which aeronautical engineer Thomas Jackey said were
recovered in good condition from the tail section. Both were
encased in apparently undamaged orange metal boxes.
   The data recorder contains several hours of information about
the plane _ its speed, compass heading and other data recorded
digitally every few seconds.
   The voice recorder has the last half hour of conversation in the
cockpit, but a transcript is not expected to be released for
several weeks. Investigators also were interviewing witnesses,
including the three cockpit crew members who survived the crash
along with about two-thirds of the nearly 300 passengers.
   Officials were still trying to get a final count on the number
of dead and the number who struggled free from the wreckage.
   Investigators and aviation experts speculated that several
factors aided those passengers who survived: the tumbling of the
plane, which had the effect of lessening the impact; the fact that
the pilot had time to prepare passengers for a crash landing; the
quick breakup of the plane that opened up wide exits; and the fact
that a large section was thrown free of the fireball that engulfed
parts of the aircraft.
   A safety board official, who discussed the investigation on
condition of anonymity, said the investigative agency was focusing
initially on the tail section because that was the location of the
engine whose explosive failure apparently started the problem.
   The DC-10's three independent hydraulic systems come together at
their closest point in the same area of the plane.
   Douglas Aircraft spokesman Don Hanson said the systems _ which
are essential to control flight, takeoff and landing _ are designed
so that the plane can fly even if two of the three fail. But NTSB
member Burnett said late Thursday that all fluid had drained from
the systems.
   Design of the DC-10 has long been controversial, with some
aviation safety activists declaring it unsafe.
   John Galipault of the Aviation Safety Institute, a non-profit
group that pushes for safer planes, said the crash underscores
serious problems in DC-10 design.
   He said the common element in several DC-10 crashes and
incidents has been loss of some or all of the pilot's ability to
control the aircraft after a catastrophic failure in a single
system.
   ``When that happens, the pilot becomes a passenger,'' he said.
``It reinforces my concern about the airplane. It's too bad, but it
has a terrible safety record.''
   In 1974, loss of a cargo door caused decompression in a Turkish
Airlines DC-10 over France. The plane's floor buckled, snapping
control cables, and the airliner went out of control, killing 346
people.
   On May 25, 1979, in Chicago, the engine of an American Airlines
DC-10 broke loose and catapulted over the wing during takeoff,
breaking hydraulic cables and causing a crash that killed 275
people. Investigators blamed faulty maintenance but recommended a
design review.
   McDonnell Douglas spokesman David Eastman said he knew of only
one design change that has occurred in the DC-10 since the Chicago
crash, involving instrumentation that would warn the pilot when
wing slats were improperly positioned.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Newspaper Employees Resign Over Publisher's Firing</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen employees of a China-funded newspaper
in Hong Kong announced their resignations today to protest the
firing of a publisher who criticized the Chinese crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters.
   The resignations came the same day China said it will not
tolerate support by Hong Kong residents for the mainland's
democracy movement and that Hong Kong will be allowed to remain
capitalist only if it stops interfering.
   China is scheduled to take control of the British colony in 1997
but has pledged to let it remain capitalist for at least 50 years.
   The publisher of the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Lee Tze-chung, was
fired Saturday by the Chinese Communist government, which pays for
the paper. The government acted through its official Xinhua News
Agency.
   The newspaper had long supported China but joined other Hong
Kong publications in denouncing the June 3-4 military crackdown in
Beijing.
   ``Today, I can't be an accomplice to the murderers anymore,''
Lee said in a television interview after the crackdown.
   In a statement sent by facsimile to The Associated Press, 18
reporters and other employees of the newspaper announced their
resignation, saying they could not accept the dismissal of Lee.
   They said that ``under all sorts of pressure, the correct
position (taken by Lee) no longer can be maintained. We deeply
regret this.''
   Earlier in the week, a senior manager at the paper, who is among
those who resigned, told reporters from other news organizations it
was ``pointless to stay because we cannot do anything.''
   The manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity, claimed
reporters who sympathized with Lee were being verbally harassed and
that management was trying to ``brainwash'' the staff to back Lee's
firing.
   Wen Wei Po ``will be another People's Daily,'' the source said,
referring to the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper
published in Beijing.
   Today's warning about Hong Kong's backing of Chinese protesters
came in a strongly worded commentary in the People's Daily. The
commentary was apparently written by a high-level government
official.
   While noting China's promise to let Hong Kong remain capitalist
for at least 50 years, the commentary said: ``Not engaging in
activities to overthrow (the Chinese government) is a precondition
for allowing (Hong Kong) to retain its capitalist system.''
   It was not immediately clear how the resignations would affect
the Hong Kong newspaper, which had about 300 employees. A woman
answering a telephone call to the paper today said there was nobody
available to comment.

   Violence in Soviet prisons and labor camps is on
the rise, and there have been three times as many instances of
hostage-taking this year than in all of 1988, the country's top
corrections official said in an article published today.
   Ivan Katorgin, head of the Interior Ministry's Department of
Correctional Facilities, said there was a 28.8 percent increase in
crimes committed at correctional institutions and detention centers.
   ``This year, there were 48 cases of hostage-taking, which is
three times more than the whole of 1988,'' Katorgin wrote in
Nedelya, a weekly supplement to the government newspaper Izvestia.
``A total of 114 guards were subjected to physical violence, with
14 wounded and one killed.''
   He said that over the first five months of 1989, 263 inmates
faced disciplinary or criminal charges and that there was a growing
tendency toward group disobedience and refusal to work.
   The Interior Ministry is taking several steps to reverse the
violent trend, such as allowing inmates to use 10 percent of their
pay to buy food in prison shops and increasing the number of visits
by relatives.
   Katorgin also said corrupt prison officials will be fired.

   Hundreds of supporters of an ousted
Navajo Indian chairman clashed with police and took over a tribal
building in a melee that left two men dead and nine wounded,
witnesses and officials said.
   Supporters of suspended tribal Chairman Peter MacDonald occupied
the tribe's business and finance building for five hours late
Thursday after a pro-MacDonald rally that turned violent,
authorities said.
   Tribal officials said the dead men were shot by tribal police
defending their fellow officers.
   MacDonald disagreed vehemently in a statement issued today.
   The tribal police, he said, ``randomly opened fire on Navajo
civilians who assembled to protest their rights to redress the
reasons why the interim government was established.'' The ousted
chairman said he was ``shocked, appalled and angered'' by the
police actions.
   Tribal police, federal agents and state police sealed off the
area today. In Albuquerque, N.M., U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs
area director Sid Mills said he had dispatched as many agents as
available to the reservation.
   A federal Bureau of Indian Affairs tactical team was working
with tribal police and FBI agents were sent to the remote
reservation, said Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. in Washington.
   The violence in the tribal capital near the Arizona-New Mexico
line was the latest episode in the struggle for power on the Navajo
Reservation. With 200,000 members the Navajos are the nation's
largest Indian tribe.
   The two victims, both MacDonald supporters, were Arnold Begay
and a man identified as either Jimmy Dixon or James Dickson. Both
men were shot, said Rosalyn Curtis, spokeswoman for the Indian
Health Hospital in nearby Fort Defiance.
   Four of the other 10 hospitalized suffered gunshot wounds, and
the others were treated for cuts and other injuries, Ms. Curtis
said.
   According to Goldstein, tribal Police Chief George John was in
Washington and pro-MacDonald forces were trying to reinstate former
Police Chief Wilbur Kellogg.
   In January, MacDonald was accused during U.S. Senate hearings of
accepting kickbacks and personally sharing in the $7.2 million
profit realized by non-Indian businessmen who sold the tribe a
ranch for $33.4 million in July 1987. He was placed on
administrative leave by the Tribal Council on Feb. 13.
   After a rally at the home of a MacDonald booster about a mile
from the government buildings, a throng of 300 members of the
MacDonald-backing Pro-Dineh Voters group and others marched or
drove early Thursday evening to the seat of government. ``Dineh''
is a Navajo word meaning ``the people.''
   Witnesses said the demonstration got out of hand when members of
the crowd attacked Lt. Daniel Hawkins, a Navajo police official who
led the May 24 sweep of the tribe's administration building that
ended with MacDonald and his appointees evicted from offices they
had refused to leave.
   Hawkins was beaten and kicked by assailants wielding 4-foot
wooden clubs who ``handcuffed him and left him lying there,'' said
tribal spokesman Duane Beyal. He said the crowd then went after a
second officer, taking his revolver while beating and handcuffing
him.
   Onlookers said Dixon took Hawkins' gun and shot tribal police
Sgt. Daniel Lee. According to varying accounts, Lee either returned
the fire, killing Dixon, or Dixon was gunned down by other officers.
   Beyal said Begay was shot fatally by an unidentified officer who
saw Begay with a club about to hit another officer from behind.
   Witnesses said the crowd turned its clubs on the doors of the
tribe's financial services building to break in.
   The situation remained in flux for about five hours, with an
estimated 100 MacDonald supporters in the building and about 150
supporters of interim Chairman Leonard Haskie on a ridge
overlooking the building.
   Tribal police left the scene about 8:15 p.m., although members
of opposing factions were still facing off and armed with clubs and
chains, witnesses said. The building's occupants finally left about
11 p.m., and police moved in to cordon off the site.
   Officials said the business and finance building and another
building were closed at noon Thursday after there were threats of
an attack.
   MacDonald's whereabouts could not be determined Thursday night.
Earlier in the day, he issued an executive order instructing ousted
Kellogg to reassume the office of police chief and to ``restore law
and order'' on the reservation.

   The government plans to test beef from
the United States and other countries for Alar and other suspected
cancer-causing substances, a news report said today.
   Meanwhile, consumers remained wary of U.S. grapefruit after an
Alar scare based on a false interpretation of a chemical test.
   In Taiwan, consumers were shunning U.S. cherries, even though
health officials say the fears of Alar in that fruit are unfounded,
importers said.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said this country's
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry will oversee meat
testing and return beef imports if the tests ``turn up the smallest
traces'' of daminozide, known commercially as Alar, or other
chemicals.
   South Korea imports beef from the United States, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand.
   A ministry spokesman said he could not confirm the news report,
but he said the matter was under study. The spokesman said
officials were concerned about a U.S. report published May 24 that
found Alar residues in meat.
   The study, by Alar's manufacturer Uniroyal Chemical Co., found
.20 parts per million of Alar in unspecified meat. The
Environmental Protection Agency said, however, it found no reason
to restrict the use of Alar in any food except apples, where it
found Alar levels of 1.0 parts per million.
   EPA's mention of the study in the Federal Register did not
explicitly say where the Alar in meat came from. However, it
suggested the chemical came from animals feeding on fruit or other
products treated with Alar.
   Alar leaped into the international picture in February when a
U.S. consumer group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in
a report that eating apples treated with Alar increased cancer risk
in children.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug
Administration disputed the group's report as a major exaggeration
of the risk, but apple sales fell immediately.
   Despite its criticism of the report, the EPA plans to ban the
use of Alar next spring. The manufacturer has withdrawn Alar from
the U.S. market.
   Alar is used to make apples redder and enhance their shelf life.
   Korean consumers began boycotting U.S. grapefruit last month
after a government laboratory appeared to have detected traces of
Alar in Florida grapefruit. The report later proved to be mistaken,
but consumers remained skeptical and a campaign to ban Alar and
other chemicals from food products has grown. South Korea about a
dozen consumer groups claiming 2 million members.
   In Washington on Thursday, lawmakers from grapefruit-growing
states blamed the chemical scare on the Seoul government and said
unfair trade charges should be filed against South Korea for using
``scare tactics for protectionism.''
   Washington has pushed Seoul to open its markets to more U.S.
farm products. South Korean farmers have protested, claiming the
imports undercut domestic prices. However, consumer groups in South
Korea say their worries center on harmful chemicals, not trade
issues.
   U.S. Rep. Tom Lewis, R-Fla., said the boycott has left 60,000
boxes of American citrus rotting in South Korea. A spokesman for
the citrus industry in Seoul said he was unaware of any losses, but
he conceded that if the fruit is left in cold storage will not last
long.
   In Taipei, Taiwan, the government's Health Department announced
Thursday that cherries were safe to eat after laboratory tests
showed the imported U.S. fruit carried no residue of Alar.
   The tests were conducted following reports from South Korea that
Alar was found in cherries imported from the United States.
   One importer, Hsieh Chien-chih, said people were still shying
away from the cherries. ``People are confused by the contradictory
reports, and they feel it is safer to eat Taiwan watermelons or
guavas instead,'' the importer said.
   ``People say they can be killed after eating the fruit. The
market is over for cherries this year,'' the importer said.
   Taipei Fruit Trade Association officials said cherry sales had
dropped more than 60 percent since the South Korean test results
were published this month.
   In Yakima, Wash., Brent Heinemann of the Washington state
Department of Agriculture said two 1,700-box containers of
Washington cherries were sitting at the port of Inchon, west of
Seoul, unable to clear customs.
   Trade industry officials in Seoul confirmed a cherry shipment
was stalled at customs but said it was held up over a claim of
improper handling by the shipper.

   A battle plan for a national abortion-rights
campaign is expected to emerge from the National Organization for
Women's national convention, scheduled to begin today.
   This is the first meeting of NOW since the U.S. Supreme Court's
July 3 ruling in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services Inc.,
which allows states to enact certain restrictions on abortions. The
convention is expected to draw about 1,500 people through Sunday at
the Cincinnati Convention Center.
   NOW officials said the campaign will work on both the national
and state levels.
   ``We feel very strongly that we have to have a national focus,''
said Patricia Ireland, NOW executive vice president. ``We don't
think states' rights have ever been good for individual women.''
   In the new ruling, the Supreme Court allowed states a greater
role in regulating abortion than had been allowed under its
landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which established a woman's
right to choose abortion.
   On the state level, NOW plans to help launch ballot initiatives
for abortion rights, Ms. Ireland said.
   NOW hopes to begin a ``Freedom Caravan for Women's Lives'' by
the end of August, said NOW spokeswoman Julie Nobel. The caravan
would travel from state to state, taking NOW members to train local
teams to carry out initiative or legislative campaigns.
   NOW planned to hold an abortion rights march in downtown
Cincinnati on Saturday afternoon. The group will travel from the
convention center to the Hamilton County Courthouse.
   Anti-abortion activists have announced plans to hold a
counterdemonstration across the street, despite being denied a
parade permit. Other topics of discussion at the NOW convention
include lesbian rights, sexual harassment, feminism and the
homeless.

<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said today that South African officials have rejected his
request for the dismissal of more than 2,000 Namibian police
associated with a notorious paramilitary unit.
   However, the U.N. chief predicted that Namibia will hold
elections as scheduled Nov. 6 to establish an independent
government and end 74 years of South African rule.
   Perez de Cuellar said the main threat to free and fair elections
concerned charges of intimidation by Namibian police who belonged
to the disbanded paramilitary unit known as Koevoet, the
Afrikaans-language word for ``crowbar.''
   ``I want to totally remove the shadow of Koevoet,'' he told a
news conference at the end of his three-day visit to Namibia.
   Perez de Cuellar said former members of Koevoet, known for its
often brutal tactics in the territory's 23-year bush war, had
created ``an atmosphere of mistrust'' in northern Namibia, where
most of the fighting took place.
   He said Namibia's South African administrator, Louis Pienaar,
rejected his request to dismiss all former Koevoet members from the
police force, which is responsible for law and order during the
transition to independence.
   Pienaar met with Perez de Cuellar on Wednesday and announced
that former Koevoet members would be moved away from north-central
Namibia into less tense regions. He said he will dismiss policemen
only if it can be proved they engaged in misconduct.
   ``I'm sorry to say I'm not totally satisfied,'' the U.N. chief
said. ``Elimination (of Koevoet) would create a better situation.''
   He indicated he would discuss the matter further with South
Africa's foreign affairs minister, Pik Botha.
   Koevoet was officially disbanded this year, but more than 2,000
of its members were integrated into the regular police force.
Koevoet's founder and former leader, Gen. Hans Dreyer, is the
police commander in northern Namibia.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization, which waged the war
against South African rule and is favored in the November
elections, alleges that former Koevoet members continue to harass
its supporters.
   During Namibia's war, Koevoet members traditionally went on
weeklong patrols through isolated villages and bush territory in
armored vehicles mounted with machine guns. They were accused of
dozens of atrocities against both civilians and guerrillas.

   The Justice Department will file an
affidavit which could kill at least one criminal charge against a
former CIA station chief in the Iran-Contra case and might even
scuttle the trial, a prosecutor said today.
   Associate independent counsel Laurence Shtasel told a court
hearing the affidavit will bar the use of classified information
concerning various CIA programs in the trial of Joseph Fernandez on
four criminal charges.
   Fernandez, the former CIA station chief in Costa Rica, is
scheduled to go on trial Monday on two counts of obstruction and
two counts of making false statements.
   The Justice Department notified the independent counsel's office
Thursday night that it would file an affidavit addressing
classified information that Fernandez ``would be prohibited from
using,'' Shtasel told U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton.
   Shtasel said the classified information at issue concerns CIA
programs and may also include data about various CIA stations.
   Shtasel, who will prosecute the case against Fernandez, said if
the affidavit is limited to information concerning CIA programs,
the case could be saved by dropping one of the false statement
counts.
   If the affidavit is more broadly worded, however, it ``would
have more drastic consequences,'' Shtasel said. A broadly worded
affidavit ``leaves greater doubt'' whether the case against
Fernandez can go to trial, he said.
   Officials from various federal agencies were meeting late today
to discuss the scope of the affidavit, expected to be filed Monday,
Shtasel said.
   The Justice Department's action will mark the first time the
government has taken the step of filing an affidavit to bar the use
of classified information in a criminal case. Under federal law,
once the judge receives such an affidavit, he has no choice but to
prohibit the use of the classified information in a trial. If that
information is critical to a defendant's case, the judge must
dismiss the case.
   By now, ``everybody should have a clear idea of what information
they want released,'' said the judge, who was clearly unhappy with
the last-minute intervention by the U.S. intelligence community.
   Shtasel suggested that Fernandez' Iran-Contra trial be delayed
but the judge said he will not reschedule the case again. He
already has granted one two-week delay in the case.
   Fernandez' attorney, Thomas Wilson, said the filing of a Justice
Department affidavit leaves the court little choice but to drop the
charges.
   ``This defendant is on a rack,'' Wilson said. The lawyer
suggested that the case be thrown out, but Hilton denied that
request.
   ``There are various options that are being debated,'' Justice
Department spokesman David Runkel said Thursday when asked about
the Fernandez case.
   Asked if the options include a move by the department that would
scrap the case, Runkel said, ``That's not a decision that we would
ever make.''
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh's office, said only, ``There are very serious matters being
discussed with respect to the Fernandez case and the discussions
are ongoing.''
   Fernandez is charged with two counts of obstruction and two
counts of making false statements to Iran-Contra investigators from
the CIA and the Tower Commission in 1987.
   The indictment says he falsely told the CIA inspector general's
office a secret airstrip construction project that was to be part
of the Contra supply network was initiated by the Costa Rican
government.
   In congressional testimony that cannot be used against him at
his trial, Fernandez admitted that former National Security Council
aide Oliver North and others in the U.S. government initiated the
project.
   Fernandez falsely told the Tower Commission he did not know for
a fact that North was assisting the Contra resupply operation,
according to the indictment.
   Fernandez is accused in a bill of particulars filed by
prosecutors of making 19 additional statements that were so
misleading they obstructed the Tower Commission and CIA inspector
general office's inquiries into the Iran-Contra scandal.

<HEAD>Three Of Four Van Winners In Kraft's Alternate Drawing Opt for Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three of four people who won vans in a drawing
held by Kraft USA as an alternative to a botched contest have opted
to take $17,000 each in cash instead of vehicles, the company says.
   Only a 35-year-old mother of two from suburban Norridge decided
to take a van in the rerun of the Kraft Singles cheese contest that
last month mistakenly produced thousands of winners instead of only
one, the Glenview-based company said.
   ``It's good timing,'' Mary Braun, the only winner who opted for
a Dodge van, said Thursday. ``My car just broke down the Sunday
before the drawing. My car's almost nine years old and we were
looking at vans anyway.''
   Kraft's ``Ready to Roll'' contest, offered through Chicago and
Houston area newspapers on June 11, was canceled the next day when
the company learned a printing error had produced nearly 10,000
winners of vans.
   To compensate for the foul-up, Kraft sent $250 to would-be van
winners who mailed in the faulty winning game pieces by June 16,
and the company said it would give away four vans in a drawing from
a pool of vehicle winners in the first game. The company also gave
cash awards to winners of lesser prizes such as bicycles and
skateboards.
   Kraft still faces a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of
thousands of would-be winners.
   In the drawing held Friday, Kraft gave away 400 bicyles, 2,000
skateboards and 32,000 coupons for free packages of Kraft Singles,
in addition to the vans. Each category contained four times as many
prizes as originally planned.

<HEAD>Exxon Gets Permission To Start Interim Repairs To Valdez</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interim repairs to the disabled Exxon Valdez
will begin offshore as soon as ocean conditions allow divers to
assess the task of removing damaged hull plates under water,
officials said.
   Exxon Shipping Co. received permission Thursday to begin
removing the plates from the ship that struck a reef in Alaska's
Prince William Sound March 24, dumping 11 million gallons of crude
oil in the nations worst spill.
   It was towed to San Diego for repairs this month at the shipyard
where it was built, but can't navigate the shallow San Diego Harbor
channel until the hanging plates are cut off.
   The Coast Guard granted permission to begin repairs after repair
crews conducted a pollution containment drill at sea, said a
spokeswoman, Petty Officer Elizabeth Neely.
   ``As far as we're concerned, it was a satisfactory drill and the
Coast Guard has no objections to letting Exxon begin plate removal
operations,'' Neely said.
   At least six plates that peeled away from the ship's hull during
its 2,500-mile journey from Alaska must be removed so the vessel
can navigate the shallow San Diego Harbor channel without scraping
the bottom.
   Ocean swells of three feet to four feet so far have kept divers
from starting the work. They will begin cutting off the plates when
the swells subside, said Exxon spokeswoman Jan Cool.
   The work, described as dangerous because it is being conducted
in open waters, is expected to take about a week. A barge carrying
a crane and a salvage vessel will help retrieve the multiton steel
plates after they are removed.
   Exxon plans to use a 110-foot-deep, sheltered anchorage just off
Navy-owned San Clemente Island to do some of the work once company
officials receive state permission to move the Valdez into
California waters.
   The ship is in a holding pattern about 10 miles northeast of San
Clemente Island and 50 miles off San Diego.
   State officials demand that Exxon meet stringent environmental
conditions before they will allow the ship to enter California
waters, which extend three miles from shore.
   The two sides are getting closer to an agreement but none has
been reached yet, Cool said.
   Meanwhile, a Coast Guard observer aboard the Valdez reported no
signs of oil leakage or other discharges for a fourth straight day,
Neely said. The ship was described as completely cleaned out before
it left Alaska, but it unexpectedly leaked a small amount of oil as
it approached the San Diego area.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has met twice in
the last two weeks with Palestinians from the occupied territories
in an effort to promote his peace plan, a spokesman said today.
   Shamir's rival in the right-wing Likud bloc, Trade Minister
Ariel Sharon, claimed he had blocked PLO approval of the plan.
   Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir confirmed Israeli news reports
that since Sharon pushed through restrictions on the plan two weeks
ago, the prime minister had met twice with leading Palestinians to
discuss it. He gave no details on the meetings or the Palestinian
participants.
   The plan calls for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip of Palestinian representatives to negotiate an autonomy plan
for the territories. Later, negotiations would be held on the final
status of the territories.
   Sharon succeeded in imposing limitations that would postpone any
elections until the Palestinian uprising ends and would reject
creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied lands.
   The Jerusalem Post reported today that before the restrictions
were added, the Palestine Liberation Organization was about to
accept the election under certain conditions. It did not spell out
those conditions.
   It said the PLO had put together a delegation, including four
PLO members, to work out details of the elections and had proposed
Israeli officials meet with the delegation. The report did not say
if the meeting was one of the conditions for acceptance.
   Israel refuses to talk with the PLO, which it considers a
terrorist organization.
   Sharon was quoted in the Yediot newspaper as saying his move
blocked PLO acceptance. A spokesman for Sharon, Moshe Behegaon,
agreed.
   ``If it were not because of the limitations of the Likud, it
seems that Arafat would have accepted the elections plan,''
Behegaon said today. ``Sharon says the limitations are like a stone
caught the wheel of a cart about to veer out of control.''
   There have been newspaper reports that Shamir intends to dismiss
Sharon from the government at a Cabinet meeting Sunday because of
the split on the election issue. Shamir's spokesman denied this.
   ``If Sharon continues his divisive ways and causes problems in
the Likud, it may be possible that there will be no choice but to
fire him,'' Ahimeir said. ``But now it is not practical.''
   Israeli newspapers reported that two leading Likud figures,
Housing Minister David Levy and Economics Minister Yitzhak Modai,
met Shamir on Thursday and threatened to resign if Sharon is
dismissed.
   In the occupied West Bank today, a 30-year-old Palestinian woman
accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities was stabbed by
masked Arab youths in Qalqiliya, Arab reports said. She was brought
to an Israeli hospital in critical condition.
   Also today, a court extended for 15 days the custody of a
Palestinian accused of killing 16 people two weeks ago by forcing
the bus they were in to veer off the road.
   The bus attack was the worst assault against Israelis in the
19-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. A total of 572 Palestinians and 37 Israelies have
been killed in the uprising.
   Israel radio reported that the accused, Mahdi Abdel Hadi Ghanem,
shouted, ``I want to die!'' as he was was wheeled into the
Jerusalem courthouse handcuffed to his wheelchair.
   Ghanem was injured in the crash, which occurred after he
allegedly grabbed the bus steering wheel and forced it off the
road. He has not been charged.
   Under Israeli law, courts often extend the custody of suspects
until formal charges are filed.

<HEAD>Audit Alleges Falsified Records For City Deposits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city treasurer put $2 million in
taxpayers' money in a bank that employed Mayor Tom Bradley as an
adviser without seeking competitive bids for the deposit, an audit
found.
   City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg then tried to cover up the
transaction by creating documents showing other banks competing for
the deposits put in Far East National Bank, according to the audit
report released Thursday.
   The audit is the latest in a series of blows to Bradley, who
recently was elected to his fifth term in office despite criticism
of his financial dealings.
   A secretary in Rittenberg's city office said he wasn't in early
Friday to comment. His home telephone number isn't listed in the
Los Angeles directory.
   Bradley refused to comment, but sent a letter to City Attorney
James K. Hahn and personnel chief John J. Driscoll requesting an
investigation to determine if any city ordinances were broken.
   Rittenberg told the City Council the deposit had been subject to
competitive bids, the audit said. City law requires such bids on
many transactions to avoid preferential treatment of businesses and
to ensure taxpayers get the best deal.
   The deposits in Far East were made a day after Bradley asked
Rittenberg about the city's relationship with the bank, the audit
showed.
   The treasurer's office also violated the bidding procedure in
depositing hundreds of millions of dollars in several other banks,
according to the audit. More than $200,000 in deposits went to
Gibraltar Savings and Loan after Bradley invested $100,000 of his
own money through the ailing thrift in bonds unavailable to the
public, the audit said.
   City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who chairs the council's
Finance and Review Committee, and Council President John Ferraro
called for immediate hearings for Rittenberg and his senior aides.
   Comrie said copies of the audit were given to the police
department and city attorney's office, both of which are
investigating the mayor's financial dealings.

   Troopers in 15 East Coast states issued hundreds
of traffic citations and seized stolen car parts but made few drug
arrests in a crackdown along Interstate 95, one of the nation's
busiest drug trafficking corridors.
   In the 24-hour sweep that ended at 8 a.m. today, a Jacksonville,
Fla., man was jailed on drug trafficking charges and Virginia state
troopers seized 140 pounds of marijuana from one traveler.
   Arrest totals were still being compiled, said Chuck Peltier, a
spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based International Association
of Chiefs of Police.
   The effort was called Operation CoFlaMe, representing
cooperation among agencies from Florida to Maine.
   In Georgia, officers arrested five people and recovered a
truckload of luxury car parts at a rural weigh station. Georgia
State Patrol spokesman J.D. Coleman said the truck apparently was
hauling the items up the East Coast from a Florida ``chop shop''
where stolen cars are dismantled.
   South Carolina highway patrolmen reported more than 300 traffic
citations on their 200-mile stretch of I-95, said spokesman Brian
Ellison.
   ``The message is: You better be toeing the line. If you are
carrying drugs, we do stop people in South Carolina for traffic
violations and vehicle violations and we will check your car,''
Ellison said.
   Coleman said during the first 10 hours of the operation, Georgia
patrolmen stopped 5,408 cars and issued 266 citations, including
174 speeding tickets and three drunken driving arrests.
   In Florida, Darien Cedric Wright, 23, of Jacksonville, Fla., was
being held without bail today after being arrested about eight
miles north of Cocoa Beach. Troopers said they found two kilograms
of cocaine and 263 grams of crack cocaine in his car.
   Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Chris Roper said he stopped
Wright for failing to drive within a single lane on the interstate.
Wright consented to have the car searched and a dog sniffed
cocaine, police said.
   ``We're concentrating on highway safety violations, but anytime
you're out there in such a mass effort _ we're hoping the criminals
using the highways are aware we're out there,'' said Florida
Highway Patrol Lt. Randy Brown in Jacksonville. ``Maybe this will
have an adverse affect on criminals using our highways.''
   In Massachusetts, about 10 people were arrested on drug charges
Thursday, State Trooper Francis Poiterast said.
   In Rhode Island, three people were arrested on charges of
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, one just on
possession and one trucker on a charge of possession of a sawed-off
shotgun, said Lt. Norman Pineau.
   Pineau said 1,148 people were stopped and 213 were issued
traffic citations, including 43 for speeding.
   At least 70 traffic citations were issued in Pennsylvania on
Thursday. There were no drug arrests or seizures of contraband or
weapons, said Pennsylvania trooper Roger Hoffman.
   Truckers who had been stopped in several states were complaining
by the time they reached Pennsylvania, Hoffman said.
   ``We had one trucker stopped, and he was already stopped in
North Carolina and Virginia before we stopped him,'' Hoffman said.
``He said, `Please, how many times I got to get stopped today?'''

<HEAD>AIDS Activists Praise Bush Appointments to Commission</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 8th graf, In sharp, to clarify previous commission was
appointed by Reagan and is not the same as new commission created by Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   AIDS activists are heaping praise on President
Bush for his two appointments to a new AIDS commission that will
help plan a national strategy to fight the epidemic.
   The president's selection of a homemaker with AIDS and a
prominent medical professor for the 15-member commission is an
indication that Bush will be responsive to AIDS issues and to
victims of the deadly disease, activists say.
   ``These appointments show that Bush agrees with the principle
that people with AIDS should be part of the decision-making process
... and that there is a great need to adapt our health care system
to the needs of such an epidemic,'' said Mathilde Krim, founding
co-chairwoman of the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
   Bush on Thursday named to the National Commission on Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome:
   _Belinda Ann Mason, a young mother of two infected during a
blood transfusion who went on to become president of the National
Association of People with AIDS and a crusading educator about the
disease.
   _Dr. David E. Rogers, a professor of medicine at Cornell
University Medical College in New York and former president of the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, who has an interest in health care
delivery.
   Praise for Bush's selections overshadowed the criticism he has
received for a delay in making the appointments and letting the
panel begin its work.
   In sharp contrast to a previous AIDS panel set up by President
Reagan that was embroiled in turmoil from its inception, the new
commission created by Congress is considered well-balanced and its
members sensitive to the crisis that has claimed nearly 57,000
American lives.
   ``There are really no right-wing ideologues on the commission,''
said Robert Bray, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign Fund.
``We believe this is an indication that finally a responsible and
nonpunitive AIDS policy is taking hold.''
   The panel also has a member who is openly homosexual: Larry
Kessler, executive director of the Boston AIDS Action Committee.
   Mason, 30, is a former newspaper reporter and one-time Kentucky
state public information officer who was diagnosed as carrying the
AIDS virus in January 1987 while living in rural Hartford, Ky. She
contracted the virus from a transfusion during childbirth.
   ``It's really the first time a president and administration has
recognized people with AIDS as part of the solution and not part of
the problem,'' said Tom Sheridan, director of public policy for the
AIDS Action Council.
   Last year, the panel chaired by retired Adm. James Watkins
called for a major escalation of federal efforts to treat, cure and
prevent AIDS, as well as legislation to protect AIDS victims
against discrimination.
   Three Cabinet officers also will serve on the commission: Dr.
Louis Sullivan, secretary of health and human services; Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney, and Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward
Derwinski.
   The commission also includes: Rep. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., a
physician; Diane Ahrens, head of the Ramsey County, Minn., board of
commissioners; Scott Allen, a Baptist minister and coordinator of
the AIDS Interfaith Network in Dallas; Dr. Don C. Des Jarlais, a
New York state coordinator of AIDS research; and Donald S. Goldman,
a Livingston, N.J., attorney.
   Also, Dr. June Osborn, dean of the school of public health at
the University of Michigan; Harry Dalton, a Yale University law
professor; Dr. Charles Konigsbert, a Kansas state health official;
and Eunice Diaz, director of community affairs at White Memorial
Medical Center in Los Angeles.
   The commission members will select their own chairman.

<HEAD>Comedian Harry Worth Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKHAMSTED, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Harry Worth, who had his
own popular BBC-TV series in the 1960s and made a comeback on BBC
radio last year, has died at the age of 71.
   Worth, who died Thursday, suffered from cancer.
   He often complained humorously that he had difficulty getting
people to take him seriously in real life because of the bumbling
comedy character he played.
   Born near the coal mining town of Barnsley in northern England,
he was the youngest of 11 children. His father, a miner, was killed
in a mine accident when he was 5 months old. The comedy star
himself began work in the mines at age 14, but decided it was not
for him.
   He broke into show business as a ventriloquist but soon got rid
of the dummy to switch to a one-man comedy routine.
   He made 104 situation comedy TV shows, starting with a series
called ``Here's Harry.''
   But his gentle, self-mocking humor was later overtaken by a
switch in public taste for the wilder comedy of such shows as
``Monty Python's Flying Circus.''
   ``His comedy was so gentle, it was like an oasis in a desert of
aggressive, rude and outrageous comedy,'' said comedian Roy Hudd.
``I think Harry's success was due to his style of underplaying
everything. He never used jokes as such. He was just a very funny
man.''
   Worth is survived by his wife, Kay.

<TEXT>
   China's media, back in the hands of government
propagandists after exercising a degree of freedom this spring, now
gives confusing, contradictory news coverage as it tries to depict
life returning to normal.
   All the major newspapers covered the pro-democracy student
movement for several weeks in May, giving accuarate, colorful and
enthusiastic reports rarely seen in the Chinese press.
   But since the military crackdown on June 3-4, during which
hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of students and their supporters
were killed, the media has reverted to being a tool of the state.
   The result is often confused reports that sometimes turn out to
be old news and a litany of the Communist Party line, as
broadcasters read word-for-word commentaries and editorials from
the party newspaper, the People's Daily.
   The government has said it was forced to crack down on the
popular student movement because it was disrupting social order to
the point of anarchy. The ubiquitous reports about production
always are prefaced with a statement about the hard-working
employees trying ``to recover the losses suffered during the
student movement that developed into counterrevolutionary
rebellion.''
   But the reports continue by quoting factory managers as saying
their employees didn't join in the popular movement. Instead, they
reported for work every day, even if it meant bicycling or walking
for hours because buses had stopped running, and the factory didn't
miss a day of production.
   Even peasants in remote areas untouched by the events in the
capital are depicted by the reports as striving to ``recover the
losses caused by the turmoil.''
   The news also reports China's top leaders performing their
regular duties, including meeting with visiting foreign
delegations, to show that international relations have not
suffered. But almost all the visitors are low-level officials or
non-government personages.
   On Wednesday, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun was shown on state-run TV
meeting with the Soviet Union's fisheries minister. Premier Li Peng
has met, among others, the former mayor of Cerritos, Calif., and
the chairman of the economic research institute of Japan's Daiwa
Securities Co. Ltd.
   In an effort to show that even the foreign businessmen who fled
during the turmoil are convinced that everything is fine,
newspapers often report the signing of new contracts or the start
of new projects.
   This month, the official China Daily reported in its lead
business story that the United States' Motorola Corp. planned to
set up a $100 million electronics plant in Tianjin, saying
``Motorola recently confirmed its plan.'' But company officials in
Chicago said the project has been on hold since the crackdown and
nothing is likely to be decided this year.
   The Beijing Review reported this week the German partners of the
Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Co. had decided to reinvest their
dividends from last year and expand production. The article said
the decision was made at a ``recent board meeting,'' and quoted a
German official as saying the recent unrest had not affected their
partnership.
   Another company official revealed, however, that the board
decision was made in April, before the crackdown, and said that it
received little, if any, press coverage at the time.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported two weeks ago that
France had agreed to provide a government loan of $130 million. But
the French Embassy said the agreement was reached in April.
   ``It's a sort of trick. It's not a new loan signed by the two
governments,'' said an embassy spokesman. France has in fact frozen
relations with China at all levels.
   Last month, the Finnish Foreign Ministry took the unusual step
of clarifying that a $22 million loan to China was agreed upon two
weeks before the June 3-4 crackdown, not after as implied in a
China Daily report.
   Such tactics are not lost on Chinese citizens, some of whom say
they have stopped reading the papers or watching TV news.

   On Budapest's busy Liberation Square,
passers-by browse at a stand stacked with books and pamphlets
chronicling the Soviet suppression of the 1956 anti-Kremlin
uprising in Hungary.
   At a nearby state-run bookstore, ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' the
chilling account of Stalinist repression by Alexander Solzhenitsyn,
the exiled Soviet Nobel Prize-winning novelist, is on prominent
display, along with the works of Hungary's most gifted opposition
writers.
   ``A year ago, we would have been hauled to the police station,
interrogated, beaten and fined for this,'' said Zoltan Kurdi, a
dissident-turned-publisher who operates a small book stand on
Liberation Square.
   His selection contains memoirs of those who fought in the
streets in the 1956 uprising, works critical of Hungary's ruling
Communist Party, and Western accounts of life and politics in
Eastern Europe.
   Buoyed by a new law that virtually eliminates all forms of press
and book censorship, Hungary's underground publishers have
abandoned their basements and attics for the streets and
storefronts.
   They are being joined by an increasing number of private
entrepreneurs trying to cash in on a new and unfettered market,
with official publishing houses also eager to compete.
   Even state-run firms freely tout interpretations of the 1956
revolt against Stalinism that contradict the long-held official
view that it was a counterrevolution.
   Instead of smuggling them in from the West, Hungarians need only
walk to their neighborhood bookstore for copies of George Orwell's
``1984'' or ``Animal Farm'' and the works of distinguished
Hungarians that were published only abroad for decades.
   Even an essay by the founder of Socialist ideology, Karl Marx,
has returned to the shelves, freed from a ban imposed because it
stridently condemned censorship.
   ``After 40 years of a controlled book culture, we are rapidly
entering an era of open and free book publishing,'' said Peter
Inkei, general director of the Ministry of Education and Culture's
publishing division.
   ``Two years ago all this seemed like something that could only
happen in the very distant future,'' added Inkei, whose office once
was responsible for red-flagging potentially troublesome
manuscripts for Central Committee censors.
   The changes, like the bold overall reforms that made them
possible, have brought new challenges.
   ``For years, the people who published underground literature
were risking their freedom to fight cultural repression,'' says
Kurdi, 24, whose group this year formed a limited publishing
partnership.
   ``Now our biggest problem is to find ways of dealing with
unscrupulous publishers and making sound business decisions to stay
afloat.''
   The publication of Solzhenitsyn's ``Gulag Archipelago'' has
caused the most headaches for government officials and fledgling
private publishers.
   The Hungarian translation is a pirate edition, published
privately without the author's permission and in violation of
international copyright laws.
   ``These people (the pirate publishers) are only motivated by
greed,'' fumed Kurdi, who said he and his friends had risked prison
for years to bring out similar books at or below cost when there
was no other legal outlet.
   Inkei said publication of ``Gulag Archipelago'' put the
government in a quandary.
   ``If we had tried to ban it at first, we would have been accused
of trying to suppress it,'' said Inkei, whose office is moving to
prohibit sale of the book because it violates Hungarian marketing
laws.
   Inkei said his staff gets criticized by the 30 state-run
publishing houses for allegedly favoring the 100 or so new private
publishers, who in turn have not forgotten that his office was once
responsible for ``sniffing out trouble'' in submitted manuscripts.
   ``We are now on the castle's ramparts, defending ourselves from
all sides,'' he said.
   In the old days, he said, ``most books that intellectuals wanted
to read were unavailable.''
   Often, he said, proposed books were withdrawn quietly after his
office informed publishers that manuscripts had been earmarked for
``consultations'' with the policy-setting Central Committee.
   Inkei said his staff devotes its time to advising the government
on publishing and tax laws and evaluating grant applications from
government-owned and private publishers.
   All could use the money.
   ``Right now we're operating in the red,'' Kurdi said, surveying
the array of once-outlawed books at his book stall.
   ``We over-estimated the demand for books on the 1956 revolt,''
he added. ``The market's glutted now and they're not moving very
fast.''
   Warm summer weather also was hurting business, he said. ``People
are looking for light reading right now.''

<HEAD>Teacher Salaries Up, But Buying Power About the Same</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers' salaries have been on the rise since
the early 1980s but their purchasing power is only slightly higher
than in 1972, the American Federation of Teachers said Friday.
   The average 1988-89 salary of $29,629 _ an all-time high _ is
$737 higher than the average 1972 salary when adjusted for
inflation, the union said in releasing its annual earnings survey.
   Salaries have risen considerably in the 1980s, including 5.5
percent since last year. But ``trying to recover the salary high
water mark is as motivating as trying to get ahead on a
treadmill,'' AFT President Albert Shanker said in a statement.
   He calculated that all raises teachers have received since 1972
average out to $41 a year.
   ``That's obviously not enough to pay a mortgage or provide for
one's family, and it's certainly not enough of an incentive to
enter teaching,'' Shanker said.
   The union's 50-state survey is based on information from state
education departments. It said the 1972 average teacher salary was
$9,702 _ amounting to $28,892 in 1988 dollars or only slightly less
than current earnings.
   Salaries across the country range from Alaska at $41,832 to
South Dakota at the bottom with $20,525, the AFT said.
   Fourteen states reported starting salaries exceeding $20,000 and
four _ Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia _ had
starting salaries below $16,000. Five states _ Alaska, California,
Connecticut, Hawaii and New York _ reported first-year wages of
more than $22,000.
   The rival National Education Association reported similar
findings in a teacher salary study released in March. The AFT
conclusions also were consistent with the Education Department's
latest ``wall chart,'' a state-by-state comparison of education
indicators issued in May.

   Coal miners in Siberia ended their
strike today after exacting promises of better food, housing and
working conditions, but the wave of unrest they launched continued
in other key coal regions.
   Some of the 150,000 miners who went on strike last week in
Siberia's Kuznetsk coal basin region returned to work Thursday, and
the rest went back today, strike leaders and the official Tass news
agency said.
   Despite announcements that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
sweeping concessions _ including granting miners greater control
over their industry _ apply nationwide, hundreds of thousands of
miners stayed off the job elsewhere.
   In the largest coal region, the Donetsk Coal Basin of the
Ukraine, more than 300,000 miners were on strike, the deputy
minister of the coal industry, Alexander P. Fisun, told Izvestia.
   In the Karaganda region of the southern republic of Kazakhstan,
the Soviet Union's third-biggest coal-producing area, all 26 mines
were at a standstill, and miners made more than 70 demands,
Izvestia said.
   Strikes were also reported in the Pechora Coal Basin in the
Russian republic, and Chervonograd in the western Ukraine, official
media said.
   The labor unrest is the Soviet Union's worst in six decades.
   Gorbachev has expressed sympathy for the strikers and placed
much of the blame for the miners' deteriorating working and living
conditions on leaders of the officially sanctioned trade unions.
   Still, he and other Communist leaders have warned that if the
strikes don't end quickly, coal shortages will shut down much of
the country's industry.
   On Wednesday, the Kuznetsk strike committee and members of a
high-level government commission signed an agreement meeting many
demands.
   The workers were promised higher wages, increased deliveries of
meat, sugar, soap, clothes, furniture and other consumer goods,
more housing construction and _ most important _ a greater voice in
running their industry.
   ``It's a victory over the system that we've had in the Soviet
Union for the last 70 years, a system in which we work hard but get
little in return,'' said Pyotr A. Menayev, an engineer at the
Taldinski Severny open pit mine on the outskirts of Prokopyevsk.
   Strike committee member Vyacheslav G. Akulov stressed that the
miners had agreed to ``interrupt the strike, not to end it.''
   He said the miners would hold the government to its word: ``If
the government doesn't keep its promises, we will go back on
strike.''
   The 26-member strike committee met today with a half-dozen
representatives to the national parliament and called for municipal
elections to be advanced from the spring to the first half of
November.
   The last local elections in Kuznetsk were held two years ago,
before Gorbachev's reforms made elections more democratic by
offering multiple candidates.
   The strike wave began 11 days ago in Kuznetsk, the country's
second-largest coal field.
   Tass said late Thursday that strikes had ended at six mines in
the Donetsk region but that most mines in the area remained on
strike.
   Miners at three shafts in Chervonograd, near the Polish border,
joined the walkout Thursday night, said Anatoly M. Dotsenko, a
spokesman for the Ukrainian Helsinki Watch Group.
   The coal industry employs more than 1 million workers.
   Tass today quoted Coal Minister Mikhail I. Shchadov as saying
the government agreed to make all Soviet coal operations
economically and legally independent.
   He said authorities had agreed to additional payments for night
and evening shifts and to give workers Sundays off.
   Beginning Aug. 1, mines and other industries in the ``coal
mining complex'' will gain the right to sell for negotiated prices
in the USSR and abroad products which they make over and above the
state plan,'' Tass quoted the agreement as stipulating.
   It said local managers will be able to raise coal prices to
reflect actual production costs.
   Gorbachev is trying to end the longtime Soviet practice of
setting prices for goods that bear no relation to their free-market
value and encourage and end to central control of the economy.
   Akulov said that beginning Jan. 1, the Kuznetzk coal basin will
become economically autonomous.
   ``The Coal Mining Ministry will continue to run the mines, but
the miners will have a much greater say setting production levels
and allocating the profits,'' he said.
   ``Our politics have gotten freer under perestroika,'' Akulov
said of Gorbachev's economic reform program. ``But our living
conditions have not improved.''
   Until Gorbachev rose to power in 1985, strikes were not
tolerated.

   President Bush stepped up his lobbying for the
B-2 stealth bomber today, telling Republican House members he would
not accept a plan to build just 13 of the planes while testing
continued.
   Rep. William L. Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the
House Armed Services Committee, said Bush insisted at the White
House meeting that it would be ``devastating to arms control
efforts if Congress would not authorize the B-2.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, had said Thursday that Congress needs more information
on the costly radar-evading plane before deciding whether to kill
it or spend more money.
   Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn., said he was unconvinced by Bush's
argument for full financing, and suggested a compromise that would
allow 13 planes to be built while testing continued through 1993.
He said Bush rejected the offer.
   ``I was not convinced by the president's remarks,'' Rowland
said, adding ``there are a small number of Republicans and
hopefully a large number of Democrats'' who believe testing should
be completed before a commitment is made to build the 132 planes
that the administration wants.
   ``By 1993 we will have purchased 44 planes'' at a cost of $40
billion, Rowland said, adding it is a better idea to build 13,
``fly them around ... develop them and then make a determination.''
   Bush began his personal involvement in the administration's
defense push Thursday, calling Aspin and other members of the House
Armed Services and Appropriations committees to the White House.
   He pressed them to back his budget proposals for the B-2, as
well as the Strategic Defense Initiative, the MX missile and the
Midgetman missile.
   The House and Senate are scheduled to vote next week on those
programs and a package of Pentagon cuts the administration proposed
to meet a $10 billion reduction target in the defense budget agreed
to by congressional and administration negotiators.
   Bush told lawmakers the package and the weapons systems are
essential to the nation's deterrent capability and to the U.S.
strategy at the arms reduction talks in Geneva, said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, meanwhile, pressed the B-2's case
to House Republicans, who are divided on the issue.
   The Pentagon hopes to buy 132 planes at a cost of about $70
billion.
   In fiscal 1990, the Defense Department has proposed spending
$4.7 billion for the B-2, but last month the House Armed Services
panel cut $800 million from the budget.
   Aspin told reporters after the White House meeting he could not
predict which way Congress would go on the Pentagon spending bill.
   ``I say, give the opponents of the B-2 an up-or-down vote. If
the Congress is willing to step up to this issue this year, I say
let's do it,'' Aspin said.
   If other efforts to limit production of the plane fail, Aspin
said he will propose funding production of only two bombers in 1990
and 1991, when the administration wants eight bombers. His
amendment would meet the full request for research and development
work over that period.
   He called his amendment ``a cold turkey fence of the procurement
money until Congress acts again.''
   Aspin said his plan ``shuts down the program, but it gives the
administration a chance to come up with another program that's
politically more acceptable _ financially.''

   China's media, back in the hands of government
propagandists after exercising a degree of freedom this spring, now
gives confusing, contradictory news coverage as it tries to depict
life returning to normal.
   All the major newspapers covered the pro-democracy student
movement for several weeks in May, giving accuarate, colorful and
enthusiastic reports rarely seen in the Chinese press.
   But since the military crackdown on June 3-4, during which
hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of students and their supporters
were killed, the media has reverted to being a tool of the state.
   The result is often confused reports that sometimes turn out to
be old news and a litany of the Communist Party line, as
broadcasters read word-for-word commentaries and editorials from
the party newspaper, the People's Daily.
   The government has said it was forced to crack down on the
popular student movement because it was disrupting social order to
the point of anarchy. The ubiquitous reports about production
always are prefaced with a statement about the hard-working
employees trying ``to recover the losses suffered during the
student movement that developed into counterrevolutionary
rebellion.''
   But the reports continue by quoting factory managers as saying
their employees didn't join in the popular movement. Instead, they
reported for work every day, even if it meant bicycling or walking
for hours because buses had stopped running, and the factory didn't
miss a day of production.
   Even peasants in remote areas untouched by the events in the
capital are depicted by the reports as striving to ``recover the
losses caused by the turmoil.''
   The news also reports China's top leaders performing their
regular duties, including meeting with visiting foreign
delegations, to show that international relations have not
suffered. But almost all the visitors are low-level officials or
non-government personages.
   On Wednesday, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun was shown on state-run TV
meeting with the Soviet Union's fisheries minister. Premier Li Peng
has met, among others, the former mayor of Cerritos, Calif., and
the chairman of the economic research institute of Japan's Daiwa
Securities Co. Ltd.
   In an effort to show that even the foreign businessmen who fled
during the turmoil are convinced that everything is fine,
newspapers often report the signing of new contracts or the start
of new projects.
   This month, the official China Daily reported in its lead
business story that the United States' Motorola Corp. planned to
set up a $100 million electronics plant in Tianjin, saying
``Motorola recently confirmed its plan.'' But company officials in
Chicago said the project has been on hold since the crackdown and
nothing is likely to be decided this year.
   The Beijing Review reported this week the German partners of the
Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Co. had decided to reinvest their
dividends from last year and expand production. The article said
the decision was made at a ``recent board meeting,'' and quoted a
German official as saying the recent unrest had not affected their
partnership.
   Another company official revealed, however, that the board
decision was made in April, before the crackdown, and said that it
received little, if any, press coverage at the time.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported two weeks ago that
France had agreed to provide a government loan of $130 million. But
the French Embassy said the agreement was reached in April.
   ``It's a sort of trick. It's not a new loan signed by the two
governments,'' said an embassy spokesman. France has in fact frozen
relations with China at all levels.
   Last month, the Finnish Foreign Ministry took the unusual step
of clarifying that a $22 million loan to China was agreed upon two
weeks before the June 3-4 crackdown, not after as implied in a
China Daily report.
   Such tactics are not lost on Chinese citizens, some of whom say
they have stopped reading the papers or watching TV news.

<TEXT>
   Three Soviet warships steamed into the
Norfolk Naval Base on Friday for a five-day goodwill visit that
will include cookouts, sightseeing tours and shopping sprees.
   The guided-missile cruiser Marshal Ustinov, the destroyer
Otlichny and the oiler Genrikh Gasanov docked at Pier 7 about 8:30
a.m. after exchanging 21-gun salutes with Fort Monroe at the
entrance to the Hampton Roads harbor.
   ``They're sharp looking. The sailors look good,'' said U.S. Navy
Lt. Cmdr. John Lloyd as he watched from the pier. ``They did an
impressive job of shiphandling when they reached the pier.''
   The 1,100 Soviet sailors will spend much of their time mingling
with sailors at the base.
   ``They're going to have barbecues, cookouts,'' said Capt. Paul
W. Hanley, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman. ``We expect there will be
quite a lot of person-to-person contact.''
   The Soviet sailors will tour the Navy base, eat at a pizza
parlor and McDonald's, visit a shopping mall and grocery and
hardware stores and take a bus trip to the Busch Gardens amusement
park in Williamsburg.
   The Soviets will reciprocate the hospitality by opening two of
the ships to visitors and offering performances by a song and dance
troupe.
   When the flotilla arrived Friday, several dozen sailors and
reporters waited on the pier. A Navy band on the guided-missile
cruiser Harry E. Yarnell played the ``Star-Spangled Banner'' as the
ship raised an American flag and the sailors silently saluted.
   Then the band struck up a march and the sailors turned their
attention to welcoming their Soviet guests. A private plane flew
overhead with a banner that read ``Welcome to Norfolk'' in Russian.
   The Ustinov's band struck up a lively marching tune of its own
as Soviet sailors snapped pictures of Americans on the pier and the
Americans got photos of the warship flying the Soviet's red,
hammer-and-sickle flag.
   The visit to the Navy's largest base is the second time since
World War II that Soviet warships have docked in the United States.
Three Soviet vessels visited Boston harbor in 1975.
   Next month, three Navy ships will visit the Soviet Black Sea
port of Sevastopol.
   The exchange program was arranged last summer when Marshal
Sergei Akhromeyev, the Soviet chief of staff, visited the United
States as the guest of Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   The Soviet Embassy in Washington released statements attributed
to enthusiastic crewmen.
   ``The aim is to establish closer relations with American
seaman,'' said Warrant Officer Valery Bronich, 25, who leads a
missile battery crew on the Otlichny. ``We need to do away with the
enemy image and stop seeing each other as potential adversaries.''

   In an unprecedented appearance, Marshal Sergei
F. Akhromeyev, the Soviet Union's pre-eminent military figure, told
a House committee today that U.S. reluctance to negotiate
reductions in its naval forces is a serious obstacle to arms
control in all other areas.
   Akhromeyev said the Soviet Union suspects the United States is
interested in large cuts in conventional land forces in Europe in
order to gain overall military superiority over Moscow,
   Specifically, he said, the Kremlin fears that after such a
conventional arms reduction agreement, the United States would
build up its naval forces ``without any constraints, especially its
carrier battle groups.''
   Thus, he told the House Armed Services Committee, the United
States would ``gain military superiority in order to dictate its
will to the U.S.S.R. from a position of strength.''
   ``We regard reaching agreement on starting the talks to reduce
our naval forces and limit military activities at sea to be a major
prerequisite for further improvement of Soviet-American relations
and switching them on to really peaceful rail tracks,'' Akhromeyev
said.
   In a lengthy statement, read with the aid of an interpreter,
Akhromeyev returned to the subject of naval forces several times.
   He said the Kremlin believes that reducing land forces while
maintaining the size of naval forces or actually increasing them is
``unjust.''
   ``If you follow this line, no drastic reductions of the armed
forces and armaments in the world will be possible,'' the Soviet
marshal said.
   He said naval reduction talks should be started, first by the
Soviet Union and the United States and later by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   ``Conditions should be created for the whole range of armed
services and armaments of the (two) sides to become the subject of
the talks and subsequent talks,'' he said.
   Akhromeyev, who retired last year as chief of the Soviet general
staff, is now chief military adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   He was welcomed to the Armed Services Committee by Chairman Les
Aspin, D-Wis., who told him: ``Never has so high-ranking a Soviet
official appeared before a congressional committee. Through the
years we have seen many uniforms sit at that table _ but never one
like yours.''
   The Soviet marshal, his olive brown uniform trimmed with stripes
of red and more than a dozen rows of military ribbons, testified in
a hearing room decorated with the portraits of former Armed
Services Committee chairman and flags of the U.S. military services.
   Aspin invited Ahromeyev to testify as one of a series of
appearances before the committee by Soviet military officers and
defense experts.
   Some conservative members of the committee and other lawmakers
have called it inappropriate that the Soviets be given such a
sounding board, but Aspin has said such witnesses provide a unique
window into official Soviet thinking.
   Akhromayev received a cordial reception from the committee
today, and no members raised questions over the propriety of his
appearance.
   Akhromeyev offered what appeared to be a detailed accounting of
Soviet military spending and troop and weapons strngth.
   He said his country will spend 8.4 percent of its gross national
product _ 77.3 billion rubles _ on its military forces. He said the
United States will spend 5.4 percent of its GNP during the same
period.
   ``As of the middle of 1989 the U.S.S.R. possesses 1,398 ICBM
launchers with a little over 6,000 warheads deployed on those
launchers,'' Akhromeyev said.
   He also listed 60 submarines with 920 launch tubes for
sea-launched ballistic missiles, 160 heavy bombers and ``a certain
number'' of long-range, submarine-based, sea-launched cruise
missiles.
   ``All in all the Soviet Union possesses 2,484 strategic carriers
with about 10,000 warheads deployed on them,'' he said.
   As of the beginning of the year, Akhromeyev said, Soviet ground
forces numbered 1.596 million troops.
   He said that will have been reduced unilaterally by 300,000 men
to about 1,296 million troops by the beginning of 1991.
   He repeated Soviet opposition to the development of a U.S. Star
Wars anti-missile system but said the Soviet Union remains
committed to deep cuts in strategic and conventional arms.
   ``We intend to keep our strategic nuclear forces approximately
equal to the U.S. strategic offensive forces and we do not intend
to gain superiority in this field,'' he said.
   Akhromeyev said at several points that a ``very favorable
atmosphere of trust and decreased military tension'' has developed
in recent years.
   He called for more exchanges between U.S. and Soviet military
officers and for further appearances by Soviet officials before
Congress and exchanges between the House Armed Services Committee
and the defense committee of the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet
parliament.

   The death toll in the United DC-10 crash
was raised to 109 today with two people unaccounted for, and
investigators reported that repair work had been done on the plane
the day before the flight.
   Officials planned to lift one of the wings with a crane today to
see if there were two more bodies underneath, City Manager Hank
Sinda said at a news conference. He said 109 bodies were recovered
by late Thursday.
   Meanwhile, investigators focused on the plane's No. 2, or rear
engine, which was found to be missing its fan after the crash.
Nearby sections of the plane were found to have been sprayed with
shrapnel-like projectiles, possibly when part of the engine
disintegrated.
   Sinda reported 184 survivors from United Airlines Flight 232,
which if there are two missing persons would bring the total aboard
to 295. That figure conforms to the total reported Thursday by
National Transportation Safety Board officials.
   United was sticking by its previous figure of 293 people aboard,
United spokesperson Ann Thoma said today in Chicago.
   ``A person may have checked in at the ticket counter, gone to
the lounge and had a glass of beer and missed the plane,'' Sinda
said, explaining a possible reason for the two-person discrepancy.
``Or they might have got on the plane, gotten off to use the
washroom and missed the plane.''
   NTSB member Jim Burnett said the board had examined the last 20
maintenance write-ups for the plane, including repair work done on
the pneumatic system the day before the crash. The pneumatic system
affects air pressure in the engine, air conditioning and
pressurization systems, he said.
   ``We know of no connection between the pneumatic system and
anything that would have, could have, affected the functioning of
the engine,'' he said this morning on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   Burnett said at a news conference Thursday that investigators
were surprised to discover the entire fan-rotor system missing from
the rear engine. The DC-10 has three engines, one on each wing and
the tail.
   ``That's the first time for this type of engine that we've ever
seen,'' he said.
   The failure of the tail engine may have caused the hydraulic
system to fail, said Bob Raynesford, a spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administraion.
   Burnett also said two large nuts were found embedded in acoustic
paneling for the No. 2 engine. He would not elaborate.
   The National Guard and medical examiners had asked families for
dental and medical records and other information that would help
identify the victims, said Sinda.
   ``They're having a hard time identifying the bodies. Some of
them are in very poor condition,'' he said.
   Investigators said Capt. Al C. Haynes, the pilot, had virtually
no control as he struggled to land the DC-10 after it lost an
engine fan and sustained holes in the small wing of the tail.
   The jumbo jet's hydraulic system, which is routed through the
tail and allows the pilot to manipulate wing and tail controls,
contained no fluid as Haynes tried to bring the plane into Sioux
Gateway Airport, NTSB officials said Thursday night.
   ``The aircraft could only be turned to the right. They made
three 360-degree turns'' before Wednesday's crash landing, Burnett
said.
   United released the names of survivors Thursday but withheld a
list of casualties while relatives were notified.
   As workers continued to search wreckage strewn through a
cornfield and across a runway, investigators released details of
the harrowing last hour of the flight bound for Chicago and
Philadelphia from Denver.
   The chief flight attendant told the NTSB an explosion rocked the
jet over western Iowa, knocking flight attendants to the floor,
Burnett said. The attendant, who was unidentified, went into the
cockpit and found the flight crew struggling to regain control of
the plane, he said.
   Thirty-four minutes before the crash landing, the pilot told air
traffic controllers he had almost no control of the aircraft,
Burnett said.
   Eight minutes later, the crew expressed ``serious doubts'' they
could reach Sioux City and began discussing small airports and
four-lane highways as possible landing sites, he said.
   Investigators found a 10-inch-by-12-inch hole and three or four
smaller ones in the horizontal stabilizer, the small wing on the
plane's tail, NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said. The rear engine
sits just above the stabilizer.
   Lopatkiewicz said the holes were ``projectile penetrations'' but
declined to be more specific. Such holes could be caused by pieces
of metal spewed like shrapnel from a disintegrating engine.
   The recovery effort centered on a large, blackened section of
fuselage lying in the cornfield alongside the scorched runway. The
section had to be reinforced with large timbers and hoisted off the
ground with a crane.
   ``It's slow going,'' said Gary Brown, director of Woodbury
County disaster services. ``It's a hazard for our rescue workers as
they move through there.''
   Dr. David Greco, director of emergency services for the Marian
Health Center and one of the first physicians on the scene, said
the plane's breakup determined the pattern of deaths and injuries.
   The three members of the cockpit crew survived the crash, but
Greco said the first-class section was devastated. Passengers in
the ninth through 19th rows suffered no injuries or minor ones, he
added, but ``there was nothing left of the rear half of the
aircraft.''
   Tales of heroism abounded, beginning with praise for Haynes, a
33-year United veteran.
   Gov. Terry Branstad visited Haynes' bedside and said at a news
conference: ``He was quite emotional about the situation and tears
came to his eyes when he talked about the number of people who lost
their lives.
   ``I told him he did a valiant job.''
   The flight voice and data recorders were taken to Washington,
D.C., and found to be in good condition, said NTSB aeronautical
engineer Thomas Jacky. Their contents are unlikely to be made
public for several weeks.
   Investigators also collected maintenance records on the
15-year-old aircraft. Burnett also said toxicology tests given to
the four people in cockpit were negative.
   GE Aircraft Engines, the General Electric Co. subsidiary that
made the plane's CF6 engines, dispatched a team to assist in the
investigation.
   The missing fan-rotor system includes a rotor, disk and fan
blades. The fan is encased in the engine housing and draws in cold
air to circulate around the combustion chamber and mix with hot
exhaust gases.

<HEAD>Knauss Picked to Head Weather Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John A. Knauss, a former professor, has been
picked to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
an agency he helped create 19 years ago.
   The White House said Friday that President Bush has selected
Knauss for the post. Bush's nomination is subject to Senate
confirmation.
   Knauss, 63, is a former dean of the University of Rhode Island's
Graduate School of Oceanography.
   He was named undersecretary of commerce for oceans and
atmosphere, which oversees NOAA. The agency has 12,000 employees
and an annual budget of $1.3 billion and includes the National
Weather Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   In 1968, President Johnson appointed Knauss to the Stratton
Commission, which recommended putting all ocean-related units under
one agency. NOAA was formed two years later.
   Knauss was recruited as dean of the URI oceanography school in
1962 from the University of California's Scripps Oceanography
Institute. He retired from that post in 1987.
   He also served beginning in 1978 on the National Advisory
Committee on Oceans and Atmospheres that advised the president and
Congress on technical matters. He chaired that group from 1981-85.
   ``I am pleased and excited about the possibilities of
administering what is clearly the most important environmental
program in the federal government at a time when the nation is
giving increased attention to environmental problems,'' Knauss said
in an interview with the Providence, R.I., Journal-Bulletin.
   Several other candidates had been considered, but Knauss was
favored from the start because of his ``excellent background,''
said B.J. Cooper, deputy White House press secretary.
   Since mid-June, Knauss has been shuttling between Washington and
his North Kingstown, R.I., home.
   ``I don't see coming in and making big changes or big waves,''
Knauss said in a recent interview with the Journal-Bulletin. ``I
would hope that the Bush administration is more concerned with
environmental problems than the previous administration was.''
   Knauss is well known in professional circles as an oceanographer
and meterologist who helped define the modern practice of
oceanography.
   ``He will bring a perspective that's never been brought to that
agency,'' said a university colleague, Walter Gray.

   It will be at least two months before movie
fans learn which 25 films a panel of government-appointed critics
and the Library of Congress considers the nation's best.
   The 13 motion picture experts appointed under the National Film
Preservation Act had planned to announce 25 nominated titles on
Wednesday.
   Instead, worried that public nominations might prompt studios
into premature marketing ploys and reveal panelists' personal
biases, the panelists decided to send their individual choices in
secret to Librarian James Billington.
   Billington, with input from the motion picture division of the
Library of Congress, then will make the final selection in late
September, said George Kirgo, president of the Writers Guild of
America and a member of the preservation panel.
   An attorney for the Library of Congress and several panelists
said the meeting was conducted secretly to dispel public confusion
about the panel's work.
   ``When an evaluative meeting like this one is held, it is always
closed, because that's the ethical way to conduct it,'' said Robert
Rosen, a film archivist with the University of California, Los
Angeles, and a member of the preservation panel.
   Roger Mayer, president of Turner Entertainment Co., attended the
public portions of the panel's meeting at UCLA because the
selections carry so much potential commercial value for his company.
   ``We have a library of more than 3,500 pictures, so we're
interested in what pictures are chosen,'' said Mayer. The Turner
film library includes ``Wizard of Oz,'' ``Gone With the Wind,''
``Citizen Kane,'' ``Casablanca'' and ``Singin' in the Rain.''
   The preservation act, signed into law last year, was drafted by
Congress partly in response to complaints about the practice of
adding color to old black-and-white films. Turner Entertainment has
colored a number of its films.
   The act calls for a panel to recommend 25 titles annually,
chosen according to their cultural, historical and aesthetic
interest, to be placed by the Library of Congress on a national
film register.
   The act does not forbid a movie's copyright holder from editing
movies, or from using computers to add color. But it does require
that such movies must be labeled as colored or altered ``without
the participation of the principal director, screenwriter, and
other creators of the original film.''
   Winston Tabb, the acting deputy Librarian of Congress, said the
Library of Congress was concerned that the movie studios would use
the nominations for commercial profit.
   In preliminary polling, 57 movies were nominated by at least two
members of the preservation board.
   The leader was ``The Grapes of Wrath'' with eight votes.
``Casablanca'' and ``It's a Wonderful Life'' drew seven votes each.
``The Best Years of Our Lives,'' ``Citizen Kane'' and ``On the
Waterfront'' each received six votes.

   A Philippine Airlines jet with 98
people aboard overshot a runway in a rainstorm and crashed onto a
busy highway Friday, killing eight people on the ground, officials
and witnesses said.
   The dead were in four vehicles crushed by the twin-engine
BAC1-11 jetliner when it hit the 12-lane highway, witnesses and
hospital officials said. Among the dead was a 1{-year-old boy.
   Airline officials said 91 people were injured, four critically.
Of those hurt, 81 were passengers, who suffered mostly minor cuts,
said Enrique Santos, an airline spokesman.
   The plane was landing at the Manila airport on a flight from
Zamboanga City, 540 miles southeast of the capital, at 3:23 p.m.
(3:23 a.m. EDT), Santos said.
   According to air traffic controllers, the pilot, Capt. Ricardo
Misa, said he could see only half the runway as he approached
because of the heavy rain.
   Santos declined to speculate that weather was the principal
factor in the accident.
   ``The pilot said he was cleared to land,'' Santos said. ``It was
raining at the time, but weather conditions were above the minimum
for landing, so he was cleared to land. Visibility was three
kilometers (1.8 miles). He was told to land `when runway on sight.'
He landed and he ran out of runway.''
   Witnesses said the plane bounced several times on the runway
then crashed through a concrete wall before rolling across the
12-lane highway. It came to a halt across a railroad track, much of
its belly ripped off.
   ``We came down and went up again about 150 feet. Then we went
down again very steeply,'' said passenger Beverly Spilman, 50, a
British teacher who is vacationing in the Philippines.
   ``I did see we were nearing the end of the runway ... then we
hit the highway,'' said Spilman, who spoke to reporters at the
Manila airport clinic. He suffered only minor cuts.
   ``The flight was smooth, but the landing was very, very rough,''
said David Tillson, 55, of Tacoma, Wash. ``We landed, three, four,
five, six times on the runway. We were actually bouncing.''
   Another passenger, Roberto Mendoza, 56, cried as he recounted in
a radio interview how he thought he was going to die.
   ``People started shouting. We were expecting that at any moment
the plane would explode,'' he said. ``When it stopped, the windows
shattered and I jumped out. I thought I landed on the wings but
then I found out it was the roof of a house.''
   Officials closed the highway. The rescue was hampered by heavy
rain and traffic jams on streets leading to the scene.
   Manila airport manager Eduardo Carrascoso said the plane
suffered major damage and would be broken apart to retrieve
reusable parts. The plane's belly was ripped off but the fuselage,
although bent in the middle, remained largely intact.

   President Bush will travel to Costa Rica in
October to attend a hemispheric conference hosted by President
Oscar Arias on the centennial anniversary of the Central American
nation's democracy, the White House announced Friday.
   The main purpose of Bush's trip Oct. 27-28 will be to promote
democracy in the region, said White House Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Bush called Arias Thursday and accepted his invitation, the
White House said.
   There were no planned stops in other countries on the schedule
at this time, the White House said.
   Administration officials said President Fidel Castro of Cuba was
not invited, but that President Daniel Ortega, whose leftist
government is engaged in regional peace negotiations, is invited.
   Vice President Dan Quayle has travelled to Central America twice
this year. The visit will be the first for Bush since he became
president.

   The White House today stood by the choice of
William Lucas to be the administration's civil rights enforcer,
despite his loss of support in a stunning about-face by the
congressman who introduced him at his confirmation hearing.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush continues
to support Lucas. ``We think he's an excellent candidate,''
Fitzwater said.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., told the Senate Judiciary Committee
Thursday he could no longer support the nominee, whom he had
introduced to the panel earlier in the week when the state's
senators refused to do so.
   ``It obviously hurts the Lucas candidacy _ how much I can't
quantify,'' Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said after Conyers' about-face.
   ``We hope Congressman Conyers will change his mind,'' Fitzwater
said.
   As civil rights leaders renewed criticism of the nominee,
committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said he was not satisfied
with Lucas' testimony and was inclined to oppose the nominee when
the committee votes, perhaps as early as next Thursday.
   Conyers' turnaround came as a political blow to the
administration, which enlisted the Michigan lawmaker to stand in
after the state's senators refused to introduce Lucas at his
confirmation hearing. Senators normally extend that courtesy to
nominees regardless of party.
   ``It may hurt him some,'' Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the
ranking committee Republican, said after Thursday's hearing. ``But
I hope it won't mean much.''
   Lucas, 61, a former Wayne County, Mich., sheriff and county
executive, is seeking confirmation as assistant attorney general
for civil rights. If confirmed, he would head a staff of 151
attorneys whose duty is to enforce the nation's civil rights laws
through the courts.
   Although Lucas is black, many civil rights groups oppose his
confirmation on grounds that he lacks the experience to do the job.
   Conyers, who also is black and a leader of the civil rights
cause in the House, was viewed as a strong stand-in for the
Michigan senators.
   But on Thursday, Conyers returned to the committee and announced
``with heavy heart'' that ``I am withdrawing my support.''
   ``In my 15 years on Capitol Hill, I've never seen anything like
it,'' Simon said afterward.
   Conyers qualified his statement, saying he was ``not asking you
to reject this nomination. I still believe everything I said
yesterday about Bill Lucas except one thing.''
   ``When he testified here yesterday on the most enormous question
that is now facing the civil rights movement and the Congress _ the
seven Supreme Court civil rights cases _ I was frankly astounded,''
Conyers said.
   Lucas was questioned closely by the committee on seven decisions
made by the Supreme Court this year concerning job discrimination,
minority set-asides and other civil rights issues.
   Although civil rights groups have been virtually unanimous in
condemning the rulings, Lucas expressed no criticism but promised
to monitor the effects to determine if additional legislation might
be needed.
   Conyers said, ``If he cannot figure out that these cases are
seriously cutting back the very modest progress that we have made
on civil rights, then there is no point in me waiting for the
confirmation process to end to express my disagreement with that
assessment.''
   Lucas on Wednesday also defended his actions in 1985 when
customs inspectors found $8,800 worth of undeclared goods in his
luggage, and in making misstatements on a sworn application to be
admitted to the New York bar in 1981.
   Biden told a group of civil rights leaders who appeared as
witnesses he had growing doubts about the Lucas nomination.
   ``I was inclined to vote for him until yesterday,'' Biden said.
``Now I'm inclined to vote against him.''
   ``My vote against him doesn't relate to his lack of
experience,'' Biden said, but he expressed concern over ``whether
you're going to have somebody ... who is going to fight for civil
rights.''
   The nominee did get support Thursday from a handful of witnesses
including members of the law enforcement community. He is a former
New York City policeman, FBI agent and Wayne County sheriff.
   ``Being a black sheriff in 1968 took a lot of intestinal
fortitude,'' declared Charles B. Meeks, executive director of the
National Sheriffs' Association. Elsie Scott, executive director of
the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, told
the panel that as sheriff Lucas worked to ``improve the lot of
blacks within the law enforcement profession.''

<HEAD>Court Further Indicate Guilty Verdict in Palme Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge in the Olof Palme murder trial
indicated Friday the defendant would be convicted for the 1986
slaying of the Swedish prime minister.
   The court said Thursday it had finished its deliberations and
will announced its conclusions a week later. It ordered Christer
Pettersson to remain in custody, indicating a guilty verdict was
likely.
   Had Pettersson been found innocent he would have been freed
immediately, legal experts said.
   On Friday, Judge Carl-Anton Spak gave a further indication that
a conviction was forthcoming when he said the court had reached ``a
verdict'' and not ``a decision.''
   ``It's a verdict that the court will come forward with. From
that you can draw your own conclusions,'' Spak said.
   Swedish radio said Spak's wording in legal terms virtually
eliminated the possibility Pettersson would be sent for a
psychiatric examination for possible committal to a mental
institution, which would have required ``a decision.''
   He faces a life sentence if found guilty, although such
sentences are commuted.
   Pettersson, who has a long criminal record, denied killing
Palme. His lawyer said he would appeal a guilty verdict.
   He was tried by a panel of two judges and six jurors, each with
an equal vote in deciding guilt or innocence. A tie results in
acquittal.
   Palme, a four-term prime minister who dominated Swedish politics
for two decades, was shot and killed Feb. 28, 1986 on a Stocholm
street after leaving a movie with his wife Lisbeth.
   The prosecution built a circumstantial case relying on the
testimony of Palme's widow, Lisbeth, who identified Pettersson as
the man she saw standing a few feet away after the shooting.
   Other witnesses said they saw Pettersson earlier outside the
theater where the Palme couple was seeing a movie, and following
them down the street.
   The defense questioned the memories of the witnesses more than
three years after the killing, and noted the prosecution had failed
to produce a motive, a murder weapon or other forensic evidence to
link Pettersson with the murder.
   Pettersson, 42, admitted he was in town to pick up drugs that
night, but said he was on his way home at the time of the shooting.
One defense witness, whose reliability was questioned by the
prosecution, testified seeing Pettersson 17 miles away at a
suburban train station shortly after Palme was shot.

<TEXT>
   Nigel Dennis, whose book ``Cards of Identity''
with its fantasy and black humor won cult status among disenchanted
young Britons in the 1950s, has died at the age of 77.
   The award-winning novelist, playwright and reviewer died
Wednesday after what his family described only as a long illness.
   Born in 1912, Dennis went with his family to live in what was
then Southern Rhodesia when his father, a lieutenant-colonel in the
British Army, who died in 1918. He completed his education at
Odenwaldschule, a progressive establishment in Germany, where he
showed early literary talent.
   During the early 1930s, he sold clothes from door to door and
contributed articles to weekly periodicals. In 1934, he left
Britain for the United States, where he remained until 1949.
   His first novel, the comic satire ``Boys and Girls Come Out to
Play,'' appeared in 1949. It was praised by reviewers but had
little commercial success.
   While in New York, Dennis helped translate the works of Austrian
psychologist Alfred Adler, worked as a movie censor, and became an
assistant editor of the leftist magazine New Republic.
   From 1940 to 1958, he was staff book reviewer for Time magazine,
working in the magazine's London office from 1949 to 1958.
   He was dramatic critic for the British magazine Encounter from
1960 to 1963, was joint editor of Encounter from 1967 to 1970 and
meanwhile was chief book reviewer for The Sunday Telegraph of
London from 1961 to 1982.
   He established a reputation as one of Britain's most incisive
and amusing reviewers. He once described D.H. Lawrence's famous
1928 novel ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' as ``that mournful,
squawking, tedious little book'' and was critical of ``two-volume
biographies of one-volume persons.''
   ``Cards of Identity'' appeared in 1955. Satirizing high-minded
pretensions and people's craving for security, it describes a
conference of the Identity Club whose aim is to rule the world by
manipulating people's personalities.
   Dennis turned ``Cards of Identity'' into a play the following
year and it was staged at London's Royal Court Theater, then at the
height of its reputation for staging audacious, thought-provoking
plays.
   His play ``The Making of Moo'' was staged at the Royal Court in
1957. The satire on religion drew some protests.
   In 1962, the organizers of the Edinburgh Festival, the
prestigious arts festival held annually in the Scottish capital,
commissioned a play from him, ``August for the People,'' in which
Rex Harrison starred. It was staged the same year at the Royal
Court Theater and shown on television.
   Dennis' biography of the 18th century Irish satirist Jonathan
Swift appeared in 1964 and won a Royal Society of Literature award.
   His last novel, ``A House in Order'' set during a third world
war appeared in 1966 when he won the Heinemann Award for Fiction.
   In 1971, Dennis published a short ``Essay on Malta,'' the
Mediterranean island where he went to live soon after giving up the
joint editorship of Encounter.
   Twice married, he is survived by his second wife and their two
daughters. A funeral will be held Monday.

   Cardinal John Krol was in serious condition
at a hospital today and undergoing medical tests a day after he
complained of feeling faint while playing golf.
   Krol 78, retired last year after 27 years as Roman Catholic
archbishop of Philadelphia but retains the title of cardinal. He
has remained active as a financial consultant to the church.
   ``He is resting comfortably and is under observation,'' in
serious but stable condition, said Bob Gallagher, a spokesman at
St. Agnes Hospital. The cardinal was transferred there from a
Sommers Point, N.J., hospital where he was taken after he
complained of feeling weak and faint, said Gallagher.
   Initial reports said he had suffered a stroke, but Gallagher
said this morning that doctors were uncertain what happened.
   In 1987, Krol suffered a weak spell after celebrating a Mass in
New Orleans and was hospitalized. At that time, he was brought back
to Philadelphia and underwent surgery to stop internal bleeding. He
retired in 1988.
   He was born in 1910 in Cleveland to Polish immigrant parents and
was ordained in 1937.
   Described as the only American who ever was mentioned as a
possible pope, Krol said repeatedly he never took such talk
seriously and never sought power or influence within the church
hierarchy.

   Half the nation's 1 million coal
miners were on strike Friday, and dwindling fuel supplies
threatened the coke and steel production vital to many Soviet
industries.
   About 150,000 miners returned to the pits Friday in western
Siberia, where the worst Soviet labor unrest in six decades began
July 11, but the strike continued in other major coal-producing
areas.
   All 26 mines in the Karaganda region of the southern republic of
Kazakhstan were shut down and miners made more than 70 demands, the
government newspaper Izvestia reported.
   Alexander P. Fisun, deputy coal industry minister, told Izvestia
more than 300,000 miners were striking 94 of the 121 mines in the
the Donetsk Basin of the eastern Ukraine, the country's largest
coal field.
   Strikes also were reported in the Pechora Basin in the far north
and Chervonograd in the western Ukraine, where Izvestia said
workers at 12 mines were only doing minimum maintenance.
   The reports indicated half the industry's 1 million miners were
involved in the walkout.
   Izvestia indicated the strikers were not satisfied with an
agreement reached earlier in the week with strikers in western
Siberia's Kuznetsk Basin for pay increases and greater worker
control over the industry.
   It reported progress in overnight negotiations in Donetsk, where
miners made 50 demands, but did not give details.
   Karaganda miners remained skeptical of government promises, the
newspaper said.
   In addition to the concessions on pay and control to Siberian
miners, the government agreed to meet demands for increased housing
construction and more meat, sugar, soap, clothing and other
consumer goods.
   ``It's a victory over the system we've had in the Soviet Union
for the last 70 years, a system in which we work hard but get
little in return,'' said Pyotr A. Menayev, an engineer at the
Taldinski Severny open pit mine outside Prokopyevsk.
   Officials have said agreements made with any group of miners
would apply to all.
   A. Kostenko, a strike leader in Karaganda, told Izvestia a
strike for similar demands last winter caused authorities to make
``a lot of promises, but then they didn't fulfill anything.''
   The newspaper quoted steel workers as saying ``blast furnaces
and coke-chemical batteries are on the brink of an emergency
stoppage'' for lack of coal.
   Strike leaders in Kuznetsk supported the return to work, but
added a demand Friday that municipal elections be moved up so they
can try to remove unsympathetic officials.
   Members of the 26-member Kuznetsk strike committee met with half
a dozen representatives to the national parliament and called for
the elections to be held in November rather than in spring 1990.
   Most municipal officials in Kuznetsk were said to have backed
the miners, but strike leaders said they were not satisfied.
   ``They supported us, but not as actively as they should have,''
said Vyacheslav G. Akulov, a strike leader.
   Strike committees in 13 Kuznetsk settlements voted on the
agreement Wednesday and some strikers resumed work Thursday. The
rest returned at dawn Friday, according to their leaders and the
official news agency Tass.
   As the sun burned early morning fog off the rolling hills,
Valery E. Demski said, ``We got little concrete. Maybe there will
be more.'' He was at his job of scooping anthracite coal with a
giant crane.
   ``It was a victory, but it would have been a bigger victory if
we had continued the strike,'' said Viktor N. Sizikov, one of about
75 miners who gathered at the Taldinski Severny mine to hear
Alexander S. Kutlakhmetov, their strike committee delegate.
   Most people in the region, which has produced coal for more than
a century, live in small, brightly painted wooden houses. Some of
the houses lack running water and are located near mounds of slag
and other mine refuse.
   Apartment buildings of four and five stories are being built,
and the miners want more of them.
   Strike leaders said they would continue to press the miners'
demands.
   ``The first question is to see that the first agreement is
implemented,'' strike committee chairman Teimuraz G. Avaliani said
at Friday's meeting. ``The second question facing us is to work out
a new agreement with the government to give us more concrete
benefits.''
   The miners won the right to sell to domestic and foreign
customers whatever coal they produce beyond the amount contracted
to the state, Akulov said.
   ``We would sell that coal for hard (foreign) currency if
possible and use the money to modernize our equipment and that of
factories in the region,'' he said. ``We also would use it for
social improvements.''
   He said Japanese businessmen were interested in buying the coal.

   U.S. and Soviet officials will meet in
Stockholm, Sweden, starting July 31 to exchange views on the
situation in Afghanistan and Iran, the State Department said Friday.
   The meeting is another in a series in which the two sides
discuss regional issues.
   Afghanistan has been the subject of previous sessions but the
agenda of the upcoming. two-day meeting will be expanded for the
first time to include Iran.
   Iran apparently has been included because of the changing
situation there following the recent death of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini and the subsequent high-level contacts between Soviet and
Iranian authorities.
   Moscow and Washington have long been at odds over Afghanistan,
with each side accusing the other of prolonging the civil war in
that country.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the U.S.
delegation to the talks will be headed by the assistant secretary
of state for Near East and South Asian affairs, John Kelly.

<TEXT>
   Yiannis Tsarouchis, one of Greece's
leading artists and theater directors, has died after a long bout
with Parkinson's disease and chronic diabetes. He was 79.
   Tsarouchis died at Athens General State hospital Thursday, one
day after being admitted.
   Born in Piraeus in 1909, Tsarourichis was best-known for his
painting, which included portraits of Greek sailors and people in
traditional settings and clothing. He worked with oil, tempera and
watercolors and described his style of work as ``eastern
expressionism.''
   Tsarouchis' career spanned 60 years, with his first paintings
having been displayed in 1929.
   A graduate of the Athens School of Fine Arts, Tsarouchis also
directed theater. Most of his works dealt with themes from ancient
Greek theater.
   ``I don't know what to cry for first. The friend? The man? The
artist? Or the period that is extinguished with him? For the piece
of Greece that is leaving? I am very sad,'' said former Culture
Minister Melina Mercouri.
   No funeral plans were announced.

<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers union planned to
put a new offer on the table today in its 3{-month-old strike
against the Pittston Coal Group Inc., a union official said.
   Violence again punctuated the strike Thursday when two state
troopers were struck by rocks as they drove behind coal trucks in
their cruiser, police said today. One of the officers fired in
self-defense, but there were no serious injuries in the incident,
which resulted in 42 arrests, police said.
   Late this morning, UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran refused to discuss
terms of the proposal, saying he was late to catch a plane.
Corcoran said Thursday that the offer would be made today, the
third day of talks that resumed Wednesday following a six-week
hiatus.
   The desk at the motel here at which the talks were to take place
confirmed that a Pittston-UMW meeting was under way this afternoon,
but UMW district headquarters in Castlewood could not confirm that
the offer had actually been presented.
   Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn visited the southwest Virginia
coalfields Thursday and today to throw his support behind the
union. He told miners that political leaders should help ``protect
legitimate gains which workers have made.''
   The Boston City Council Wednesday night gave a vice president of
a Boston bank, who is a Pittston director, seven days to take
action on ending the strike. If not, the council threatened to
remove about $20 million in city funds from Shawmut Bank. William
Craig, bank vice president, said he was planning a statement urging
a fair resolution of the dispute.
   Pittston Coal Group spokeswoman Susan Copeland declined to
comment on Flynn's visit.
   Staff members of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Labor Management
Relations also were in the coalfields Thursday interviewing miners
and family members. The subcommittee members were to talk to the
coal company today.
   Also Thursday, 11 Pittston operations were hit by a power outage
caused when several utility poles were damaged. Police said the
utility poles were damaged by gunfire, a chainsaw and an explosion.
   Miners struck Pittston on April 5 over wages and benefits,
eventually idling 1,900 miners in Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky. Talks broke down last month, but resumed Wednesday after
a private meeting between both sides in a federal judge's chambers.
   The union wants the president of The Pittston Co., Greenwich,
Conn.-based parent company of the coal group, to enter face-to-face
negotiations with UMW President Richard Trumka. Paul Douglas has
declined, saying local management is authorized to negotiate a
contract.
   Pittston wants a contract differing from that reached in 1988
between the UMW and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
Pittston no longer belongs to the industry group and wants more
flexibility in its contract, including dropping a industrywide
pension plan.
   The union wants a contract identical to the BOAC contract.
   In June, wildcat strikes in support of Pittston miners began in
West Virginia, eventually spreading to 10 states east of the
Mississippi River putting nearly 46,000 miners off the job and
severely reducing production.
   Most of the wildcat strikers returned to work this week.
   Westmoreland Coal Co. announced Thursday that it was laying off
88 of its 782 employees in Virginia, partially because of lost
orders during recent wildcat strikes by miners supporting the
Pittston walkout.
   The attack on the troopers occurred Thursday afternoon outside
Clinchco, near the Kentucky line, said state police spokesman
Charles Vaughan. He said the troopers had gotten out of their cars,
and one had suffered cuts and brusises from rocks when one officer
opened fire. None of the rock-throwers was injured, Vaughan said.
   ``While state police vehicles have been hit by rocks previously,
this was the first actual assault on uniformed officers,'' Vaughan
said.
   The troopers were accompanying coal trucks, which UMW members or
supporters have been trying to block. Vaughan said 42 people were
charged with conspiracy to commit a felony _ throwing missiles at
an occupied vehicle. He said 39 were from Ohio, two were from West
Virginia and one was from Virginia.

   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley suggested Friday
that lawmakers ``devote themselves to legislation'' instead of
staging demonstrations like the one in which several sprayed water
on the effigy of a flag burner.
   Responding to rumors of a flag burning Thursday, a dozen
Republican House members carried fire extinguishers and buckets of
water to the steps of the Supreme Court. When no flag burner
showed, they demonstrated their feelings anyway for the television
cameras, dousing a stuffed dummy representing such a culprit.
   ``I think it is probably better for members of the House to
devote themselves to legislation than to maintain peace and order
in the vicinity of the Capitol,'' Foley said Friday.
   ``But I certainly do not hold with flag burning, as I think you
know,'' he added.
   The GOP lawmakers support a constitutional amendment to overcome
the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling last month that flag burning can be
a protected form of political expression. Foley, however, favors
passage of a regular statute to get around the decision, leaving
the Constitution alone.
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., told colleagues and onlookers
at Thursday's demonstration that the congessmen were setting an
example for Americans to follow if they witness flag burnings.
   ``If they don't have a bucket of water, I hope they take care of
business however they can,'' he said.
   When Foley was asked whether the image projected by the event
was the proper one for members of Congress, he replied: ``I will
leave to every member of Congress the management of his own image,
or hers.''
   ``I think your question raises the question itself about whether
that is everybody's idea of the appropriate behavior for a member
of the House of Representatives,'' he said. ``But I don't want to
try to make a judgment for the individual members involved.''

   The government said Friday it would
consider removing recently imposed censorship restrictions from
foreign journalists.
   ``Censoring the press has never helped,'' Agriculture Minister
Lalith Athulathmudali said. ``If it is extended, it becomes
counterproductive because it helps fuel rumors.''
   Opposition members of Parliament said the government's move had
backfired.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said officials will reconsider
the censorship and ``probably lift it where the foreign media is
concerned.''
   Wijeratne announced the censorship regulations July 6 as part of
a campaign against Sinhalese militants trying to overthrow the
government. He also announced security forces had orders to shoot
anyone putting up anti-government posters or instigating strikes.
   Despite members' criticism of censorship, Parliament on Friday
approved a government proposal to extend strict emergency laws in
the country for another month.
   The laws were in effect from 1983 until President Ransinghe
Premadasa took office and lifted them in January. Killings
continued in this Indian Ocean island's ethnic conflicts, however,
and the laws were reimposed on June 20.
   Minority Tamil rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland
since 1983.
   In 1987, the Sinhalese-dominated government offered the rebels
limited autonomy in exchange for a surrender of arms, but the
largest Tamil militia rejected the plan.
   The Tamil group then began fighting Indian soldiers who were
sent to enforce the agreement.
   The accord also touched off the backlash of Sinhalese militants,
who felt it made too many concessions to the Tamils.
   The two conflicts have left at least 15,000 people dead.

   A nursing home fire caused by a smoker who
fell asleep killed him and another elderly man early today and
forced rescuers to rush bedridden residents through smoke-filled
halls on stretchers.
   Three residents were injured.
   Relatives and friends hurried to comfort patients of Hallock
Memorial Nursing Home.
   ``We thought they needed to be reassured and be with someone
they know,'' said nursing director Shirley Nordling. ``It's a very
frightening experience.''
   Fire alarms sounded at 3:20 a.m., and firefighters were able to
contain the blaze largely to a single room, according to the
Kittson County Sheriff's Department.
   Two men and a woman were hospitalized in good condition,
suffering from smoke inhalation, Ms. Nordling said.
   The sheriff's department identified the dead as patients Hugh
Sugden, 79, and John Hemmes, 99.
   State fire investigator Kevin Schuman said Sugden fell asleep in
a chair, and the fire ignited his clothes and the chair and then
spread rapidly.
   Ten residents had to be moved from the nursing home to Kittson
Memorial Hospital, many of them on stretchers because they are
unable to walk. The nursing home occupies two wings of the hospital
in northwestern Minnesota, and the fire affected only one wing.
   Hospital board chairman Harold Anderson called the fire ``very
tragic, yet it's good work by all that kept it from being more
serious.''
   The cause of the blaze was under investigation. A damage
estimate was not immediately available.

   The Communist Party Politburo called
Friday for the quick formation of a new government and announced a
Central Committee plenum will be held July 29-30, Poland's official
news agency said.
   Naming a new prime minister is the first major task of President
Wojciech Jaruzelski. The general and party leader was elected to
the powerful new office of president on Wednesday with the bare
minimum of votes.
   The Politburo ``decided that negative economic notions and a
difficult situation in the market require formation of the new
government in the shortest possbile time,'' the agency said.
   Poland's economic crisis has taken a turn for the worse in the
past several months. Prices on such goods as sugar, gasoline,
ciagarettes and household appliances have increased sharply and the
inflation rate is over 160 percent. Many consumer goods have
disappeared from the shelves and meat is in short supply.
   The Politburo also said it favored creation of a government of
national accord, the PAP news agency reported, but did not provide
details. It congratulated Jaruzelski on his election.
   The government is subject to legislative approval. For the first
time in four decades, the communists face real opposition in the
National Assembly after June elections in which Solidarity
candidates won all but one of 261 seats the opposition was allowed
to contest.
   Jaruzelski and other top party officials have urged the
opposition to join a ``great coalition, but Solidarity lawmakers
have yet to take a final decision on the issue of the government.''
   National Assembly deputy Janusz Onyszkiewicz, who is also
national spokesman for the Solidarity trade union said Thursday
that Solidarity lawmakers would convene next week to continue
discussion on the government.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, declaring that ``every
American in every city'' deserves healthy air, formally presented
Congress today with clean air legislation assailed by critics as
inadequate to fix the nation's worsening pollution problems.
   Bush, in a White House ceremony, said it was time to ``break the
gridlock'' over new clean air legislation that has lasted for a
decade.
   But environmentalists and their congressional supporters
complained that said the president's plan would ease an early
draft's requirements for reducing motor vehicle pollution and
provide wide government latitude to meet industry concerns.
   The president said government must ``see to it that every
American in every city in America will breathe clean air'' and
added his plan would ``take the lead'' in reaching that goal.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chief Senate sponsor of clean-air
legislation, said the final language of Bush's bill ``will
significantly tarnish his image to be the environmental president.''
   ``The president stepped up to the problem, blinked and stepped
back,'' Baucus said, contending the bill would increase motor
vehicle emissions, allow cities too much time to clean air and give
too much weight to cost in toxic chemical cleanup.
   Bush, at a White House photo session, declined to answer a
reporter's question about the criticisms. But press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said it was regrettable that the criticisms were
getting the bill off to a ``rocky start.''
   ``We're very proud of this bill. We think it's a good one, and
we think the environmental community thinks it's a good one as well
... overall you'll find that their support is very strong,'' he
said.
   Fitzwater denied there was any watering down of the bill, and
said it was tougher overall than any current proposals on Capitol
Hill.
   An Environmental Protection Agency summary of the legislation
given to members of Congress Thursday showed the final version was
changed from a preliminary draft written June 30.
   The language, compared to the earlier draft, would push back new
emissions standards for cars, trucks and buses, and would give the
EPA administrator discretion to delay new regulations even further.
   Other provisions would give the administrator, local governments
and industry flexibility in taking measures to reduce ozone
pollution, acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals. In making key
decisions, the EPA chief could address industry's costs.
   Richard Ayres, head of a coalition of environmental groups, said
the flexibility was a prescription for ``chicanery and fraud'' by
industry. He said acid rain components would be reduced less than
promised, and giving weight to economic concerns would reduce the
effectiveness of provisions to control toxic emissions.
   But EPA Administrator William Reilly, who would make many key
decisions under the legislation, called the bill ``faithful in
every respect to the spirit and letter of the promises he (Bush)
made'' to clean the nation's air.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
environment subcommittee, called the final language ``weaker than
last month's draft, which was far weaker than the president's
promises.''
   ``It undercuts the clean fuel program, pushes back compliance
deadlines and loosens emissions standards. The bill actually
appears to allow emissions from cars and trucks to increase from
today's levels,'' Waxman said.
   According to the summary, new buses operated in cities with more
than 1 million population would be required to use clean-burning
fuel. The June 30 draft would have imposed the requirement on all
cities of 250,000 or more.
   While the bus program would be phased in over the 1991 through
1994 model years, the EPA administrator would have the authority to
delay the plan for two years for economic reasons.
   The EPA administrator, for economic reasons, could revise and
postpone for two years a clean-fuel program for cars _ a
cornerstone of the Bush program.
   The bill would establish a schedule requiring sale of clean-fuel
cars, beginning in the 1995 model year, in the most heavily
polluted cities. One million of these cars would be sold in each of
the model years 1997 through 2004.
   The deadline for all cars to meet new emissions standards for
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides was pushed back _ from the 1994
model year in the previous draft to the 1995 models in the final
version.
   The June 30 draft also had tougher emissions standards for light
and heavy trucks, and the deadline for meeting the new requirements
was pushed back for the light trucks _ such as pickups _ from 1993
to a phased-in period ending with 1995 models.
   Criminal penalties against auto makers, for violating the
anti-pollution emission standards, were in the draft bill but not
in the new version.
   Other provisions in the final bill would:
   _Allow the EPA administrator discretion to override deadlines
for ozone cleanup in cities, including doubling the cleanup time
from 10 to 20 years. But such cities would have to show steady
progress over the longer period of time after receiving the
extension.
   _Require a 10-million-ton reduction from 1980 levels of sulfur
dioxide, a key ingredient of acid rain. Nitrogen oxide, the other
key ingredient, would be reduced by 2 million tons from the levels
that would have been reached by the year 2000.
   Environmentalists argued the nitrogen oxide figure is not really
a reduction, just a smaller growth rate. And they pointed out the
sulfur dioxide reduction would be only 9 million tons since the
administration is counting a 1 million ton reduction already
achieved.
   _Permit auto makers to average the car emissions to achieve new
anti-pollution standards, a tactic environmentalists said would not
bring about a reduction. The EPA contended it would write
regulations to make the program effective.
   _Permit auto and petroleum companies to propose alternative ways
to reduce pollution, a plan Ayres said would be ``a floating crap
game'' that would lead to delay. EPA officials said they would
establish tough regulations to prevent industry from stretching
deadlines.
   _Require maximum available control technology for toxic
emissions, but require that cost, the feasibility of installing the
technology and energy requirements be taken into account.
Environmentalists said these considerations negated the technology
standards, but the EPA disagreed.

   He's not exactly puttin' on the Ritz, but
this phony Hollywood filmmaker is having a good time on the cuff,
leaving hotels, restaurants and night spots stuck with the bills.
   ``He's having a hell of a nice vacation is what he's having,''
said Cathy Savino, director of the Orlando office of the Economic
Development Commission of Mid-Florida.
   The bogus mogul has seen the whales at Sea World, toured the
sound stages at Universal Studios, lounged at two hotels and seen
the sights from a helicopter and the back of a burgundy-colored
stretch limousine.
   He's taken women dancing and dining at a fancy Chinese
restaurant. He's told people from Sanford to Orlando that he is
with Warner Brothers, Lorimar Studios, Spielberg Productions (which
doesn't exist), or his own JFT Productions.
   His tab has run into the thousands, but this man calling himself
John Frank has never spent a dime. He's asked businessmen to send
the bills to non-existent companies.
   Frank's victims have described him as short, dark-haired and
dumpy, dressed in a sloppy fashion.
   The Orange County Sheriff's Department is looking for him,
spokesman Jim Solomons said Friday. Ms. Savino has warned film
offices statewide to be on the lookout.
   ``This town and this community is primed for that right now
because of the two studios in town and the enthusiasm for the
(film) industry,'' Ms. Savino said. ``There are very good people in
this industry, and then there are con artists.''
   The Disney-MGM Studios theme park and Universal Studios Florida
have begun movie and television production in the Orlando area in
the last year, bringing an influx of film people, technicians,
executives and related businesses. Residents often encounter movie
and TV stars and other industry officials shopping, dining or
living among them.
   Frank told clerks and others that he was making a movie called
``Runaways,'' starring Judd Hirsch, Amy Irving, Dan Ackroyd and
River Phoenix.
   The impostor was last seen at the Holiday Inn on Interstate 4 in
Sanford, where he spent two weeks before abruptly checking out
Tuesday when Ms. Savino began trying to track him down. He had
arranged for phony corporate billing to the tune of $560.
   The film phony's Orlando-area adventures began the last week of
June, when he checked into the Red Roof Inn in a tourist area
called International Drive. Along with drinks, food and
incidentals, the tab there came to $715 plus tax.
   Before vanishing, he took desk clerk Tammy Pierson, 22, and a
girlfriend dancing.
   ``I'm from Michigan and from a small town and never knew
anybody, so when he said he was a producer, I didn't see any reason
to disbelieve him,'' said Ms. Pierson.
   Owner Randy Sprayberry of the Sandwich Gallery was out about
$150 worth of sandwiches and drinks the man supposedly bought for
his film crew.
   ``It's almost laughable that I got taken by a movie producer,
your stereotypical con man,'' said Sprayberry, who agreed to send
his bills to JFT Productions.

<HEAD>Italian High Fashion Gets Boost, Grace Jones Takes Dip</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Valentino, a new fashion pavilion and a show down
the famed Spanish Steps combined to lift the sagging image of
Rome's high fashion week.
   Sixteen of Italy's leading designers sent actors and
international models down the steps in their most beautiful
creations for the upcoming fall and winter.
   The hour-long show Thursday night, which ended with a fireworks
display, was beamed live thoughout Europe and to the Soviet Union
for the first time.
   Grace Jones created the biggest splash by frolicking in the
fountain at the bottom of the steps in a slick black leotard before
donning a luxurious blue-dyed sable fur by Fendi.
   The top Italian designers, who also include Mila Schoen, Rocco
Barocco, Galitzine, Laug, Lancetti and Balestra, produce beautiful
styles enhanced by sumptuous fabrics and artisan detailing. But the
Italian couture scene has lost the excitement of the 1960s when the
fashion creativity of such designers as the Fontana Sisters,
Capucci and Shubert, went hand in hand with the wild spirit of the
Dolce Vita.
   Rome's loss has been Paris' gain. Not only have their own
designers combined to make the ``Made in France'' label the queen
of couture but they also have lured some of the best Italian talent
into their fashion net.
   Valentino, who strayed from Italy a decade ago to present his
ready-to-wear collection in Paris, has a second showing of his
couture during the French fashion week, meaning that the bulk of
his international customers need not make an extra trip to Rome to
admire his wears.
   But Valentino swears he won't abandon the Italian capital. He
has just restored another wing of his Rome headquarters, a 16th
century building in the shadow of the Spanish Steps and this week
announced a collaboration agreement with the Italian maufacturing
company Gruppo Finanziario Tessile to produce his high fashion
collections.
   The Italian fashion chamber set up a pavilion in Villa Borghese
park for the shows.
   As his maid of honor for the Spanish Steps gala, Valentino chose
Italian actress Ornella Muti in a red silk gown. Carroll Baker,
famous for creating the scanty pajama vogue after her film ``Baby
Doll,'' had trouble inching her way down in a slinky evening gown
by Sarli.
   Outfits presented during the week included Lancetti's rich
velvet gowns with passementerie trimming inspired by the Italian
Renaissance; glittery black sequined gowns by Rocco Barocco;
elegant suits, blouses and penthouse party gowns by the late Andre
Laug; and sexy black evening gowns by Mila Schoen.
   But the winning card of the fashion week was the stunning show
of the maestro, Valentino, who outdid himself with a fall-winter
collection inspired by the geometric designs of the Vienna Liberty
school at the beginning of the century.
   The perfect little black dress in velvet or chiffon or a
combination of both was the star of the show, at times worn under
an extravagant floor-length white coat with black geometric
embroidery.
   For daytime, Valentino favors his trademark neat little suit,
adorning it either with velvet geometric detail or colored pompon
buttons in tufts of wool or silk gleaned from the fabric of the
suit.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Refuses to Exclude Khmer Rouge From Future Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk said
Friday he supports a role for the communist Khmer Rouge in a
Cambodian government despite their history of atrocities.
   He said that at an international conference starting July 30,
the guerrilla group will sign a guarantee accepting strict controls
when it becomes part of an interim government made of resistance
groups and the Cambodian regime.
   Khmer Rouge participation in a government is expected to be a
major sticking point at the conference, which represents the most
serious effort yet to end the 10-year-old Cambodian war.
   Speaking at a news conference, Sihanouk rejected a cease-fire
proposal supported by Vietnam and said resistance guerrillas will
keep fighting until all Vietnamese forces leave Cambodia, where a
Vietnamese-installed government is in power.
   Sihanouk also wants an international peacekeeping force and for
elections to follow the pullout.
   The promised retreat by Sept. 30 of the remainder of Vietnam's
troops, estimated to number up to 70,000, was a ruse, he said. He
said 130,000 other Vietnamese are ``hidden'' in the Cambodian army
and paramilitary.
   Sihanouk's remarks came four days before a scheduled meeting
with the head of the Cambodian government, Prime Minister Hun Sen,
to be followed by talks between Hun Sen and the three-party
resistance.
   The Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the three guerrilla movements,
was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians during a three-year reign of terror that ended with
Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in December 1978.
   Sihanouk said the Khmer Rouge ``will commit themselves in
writing during the international conference to accept to be
strictly controlled for several years, five years, 10 years if need
be, by an international control mechanism and a U.N. peacekeeping
force.''
   Sihanouk has said he wants controls to prevent any single party
from monopolizing power, but Hun Sen, Vietnam and the United States
oppose any Khmer Rouge role.
   Khmer Rouge representatives were not available for comment.
   The Paris conference will be attended by the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council _ France, the United States,
Britain, China and the Soviet Union _ and members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Canada and several other
countries also will participate.
   Two recent rounds of peace talks held in Jakarta, Indonesia,
produced a consensus that Vietnam's pullout must be linked with
measures to prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to power.
   In addition, there is growing pressure in the United States to
provide military aid to the non-communist resistance to lessen
their reliance on the Khmer Rouge.
   ``The Khmer Rouge are seriously committed to respecting the
spirit of quadripartism,'' Sihanouk said, referring to his proposal
for a government that includes the three-tiered resistance movement
and Hun Sen. ``We cannot let this occasion slip by.''
   Sihanouk, who negotiated his country's independence from France
in 1953 and was deposed in 1970, denied he was an ``accomplice'' of
the Khmer Rouge.
   ``They killed five of my children ... I cannot pardon them
that,'' he said. ``But if I abandon the resistance ... I serve ipso
facto the cause of Vietnamese colonialism.''
   The resistance leader said he was not against the principle of a
cease-fire proposed by Thailand. Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen
Co Thach said Wednesday he supported that proposal, saying there
could be no peaceful solution without a cease-fire.
   However, Sihanouk said a cease-fire was not possible while
``Vietnamese colonialism'' continued.
   Sihanouk made public the resistance movement's plan for a
constitution. Based on the French model, it calls for a president
elected to a seven-year term, a premier and a two-chamber
parliament. The plan specifies the name of the country as Cambodia,
a new Cambodian flag, coat of arms and a national anthem _ to be
composed by Sihanouk himself.
   ASEAN, which includes Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia,
Brunei and the Philippines, supports a Khmer Rouge role in an
interim government.

   A Cambodian refugee camp run by
communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas was hit by shelling Friday, and
one refugee was killed and 10 were wounded, Western relief
officials said.
   It appeared the shells were fired by Cambodian government forces
or their Vietnamese allies, the relief officials said.
   The three-hour attack followed overnight fighting in the area,
according to a Thai security official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The relief officials said about 27 rounds crashed into the Site
8 camp, sending most of the 40,000 residents fleeing.
   A 22-year-old man was killed and 10 refugees, including two
children, were wounded, said an official of the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
   The camp in Thailand's eastern province of Prachinburi, about a
mile from the Cambodian border, is the main civilian camp run by
the Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla group fighting Cambodian
government forces and their Vietnamese allies.
   The Khmer Rouge sometimes has shelled its own camps to exercise
strict control over the refugees. Widespread human rights
violations have been reported in Khmer Rouge camps.
   Fighting between Cambodian government forces and the Khmer Rouge
has increased along the border in recent days.

   The two leaders of the main opposition
party have been put under long-term house arrest for trying to
``destroy the military and revive anarchy'' in Burma, the
government said Friday.
   Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo lead the National League for
Democracy and have been increasingly outspoken in attacking the
military government. They were confined to their homes Thursday and
cut off from their supporters.
   Government spokesmen told a news conference the house arrest
could last a year and be be renewed under the Law to Protect the
State from Dangers of Disruptive and Destructive Elements.
   ``They will be held as long as the dangers of disruption of
peace and tranquility by them exist,'' said Col. Aung Thein, when
asked if the two could run in general elections next year. He said
their party or others might be barred from the elections if ``the
party or parties continue the excesses.''
   Gen. Saw Maung pledged soon after crushing a pro-democracy
movement in September that elections would be held in 1990.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, 44-year-old daughter of national independence hero
Aung San, sided with students and others demanding an end to
authoritarian rule. She became secretary of the league and Tin Oo,
a retired general, agreed to be its chairman.
   In Washington, the State Departmen the streets. State radio reported
44 arrests.
   The diplomat in Bangkok said tight government controls on
information probably would continue at least until Aug. 8, the
first anniversary of mass anti-government demonstrations that were
brutally repressed by the army.
   Telex and telephone lines to Rangoon from Asian cities have been
out of order since Wednesday evening. The diplomat said it appeared
the telex line was restored temporarily Friday only to allow
correspondents of foreign news organizations to file their stories
on the news conference.
   ``Outsiders cannot communicate with the inmates (under house
arrest) either personally or by telephone,'' said government
spokesman Kyaw Sann.
   He said members of the prisoners' families could leave the
premises ``under surveillance,'' but could not contact foreign
embassies, political parties or people connected with the parties.
   ``Action has to be taken'' against Ms. Suu Kyi and Tin Oo ``for
their repeated attempts to divide the military and the people and
also to cause disunity among the military,'' Kyaw Sann said.
   ``Both of them mounted their incitement in the last two months,
finally using confrontational strategy to destroy the military and
revive anarchy in the country.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two House members say they are making headway
in a long battle against Congress spending time and money
commemorating jukeboxes, asparagus, dairy goats and hundreds of
other things.
   Reps. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., and Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., are
proposing to turn the time-consuming job of recognizing pet causes
over to a commission, which would pass worthy proposals on to the
president for action.
   In the 100th Congress that ended last year, lawmakers passed 258
bills designating commemorative days, weeks or months. Among them
were National Asparagus Month, National Dairy Goat Awareness Week
and National Jukebox Week. A decade ago, the 95th Congress passed
just 34 such measures.
   ``This is clearly a reform initiative that will focus members of
Congress more on substantive legislation,'' Schneider said. Not to
mention saving some $500,000 in printing costs and staff time, she
estimates.
   She said commemoratives have proliferated because groups have
seized upon them as a way of gaining instant credibility, and
members of Congress have gone along because it's an easy way to
``throw a bone'' to the home folks.
   ``Organizations feel that if you can have a congressional stamp
of approval to your `Week of the Dandelions,' or `National
Butterfly Day,' or whatever, there is more of an establishment aura
to it,'' she said.
   ``I would not be surprised if there were not many members whose
only list of accomplishments legislatively might be
commemoratives,'' she added.
   McCurdy has been introducing legislation on the subject since
1985, but it has never moved, primarily because lawmakers are
reluctant to give up a goody they can pass out to constituents.
   But this week, McCurdy and Schneider met with Rep. Tom Sawyer,
D-Ohio, chairman of the Post Office and Civil Service subcommittee
that handles commemorative bills, and won a promise that for the
first time a hearing will be held on their idea.
   McCurdy called the move ``a welcome turning point'' and said his
proposal for an 11-member commission is ``a common-sense approach.
Creating a commission does not add another layer of bureaucracy.
Rather, it thins out the layer from the involvement of 435 people
to 11.''
   The two lawmakers have enlisted a majority of House members in
support of their legislation, which in part prompted Sawyer's
decision to hold a hearing. The session will be scheduled for
September, after Congress returns from its August recess.
   In the meantime, the beat goes on. Some 268 commemorative
measures have been introduced in the first seven months of this
year; 81 have passed either the House or Senate, and 28 have been
signed into law.
   Among proposals still before Congress: National Tap Dance Day,
sponsored by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.; National Duckling Month,
proposed by Rep. Bill Hefner, D-N.C.; the Decade of the Brain,
offered by Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass.; and National Culinary Week,
pushed by Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.

<DATELINE>STERLING, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Lang's wheat field looks green and
almost lush, waving gently in a breeze that provides a momentary
respite from North Dakota's July inferno.
   But Lang's digging fingers find surface soil so dry it runs like
salt through his fingers. Deeper, where the ground in better times
would come up in moist, dark clumps, it is pale, almost as hard as
a nearby fence post.
   The wheat stalks hold little promise of developing plump,
healthy kernels in time for the August harvest.
   ``You get down here, there's nothing there,'' Lang said, his
fingers probing the parched dirt.
   This is the second straight drought year for North Dakota, and
Lang's farm about 23 miles east of Bismarck is in one of the
state's driest areas.
   The drought of 1989 is not as widespread as the previous year,
but it still covers roughly a third of the nation, said Norton
Strommen, chief meteorologist for the U.S. Agriculture Department.
The main swath cuts northwest from Illinois through the Dakotas,
parts of Kansas and Nebraska, Strommen said.
   Virtually all of North Dakota _ the nation's leading producer of
spring wheat and durum, a wheat variety used for pasta _ is
considered to be in a ``severe to extreme drought,'' he said. Parts
of neighboring South Dakota and Minnesota also have been hurt.
   ``At this time ... to get back down to near normal, it would
take from 5 to 10 inches of rain,'' Strommen said.
   But that much rain is unlikely on the 3,100-acre farm that Lang,
43, works with his 78-year-old father, Theodore.
   On Monday, storms dumped as much as 3 inches of rain on some
parts of the state. But, said Lang, ``it missed us.''
   The Lang farm has gotten only about 4{ inches of rain since
April 1, about half of what the thirsty soil needs.
   ``There isn't any subsoil moisture,'' said Theodore Lang, a
state representative since 1965 and a lifelong farmer. ``That's
where the problem is.''
   The wheat field David Lang surveys may yield three or four
bushels an acre, a sixth of its normal yield and barely enough to
make harvesting worthwhile.
   ``Last summer, it held on for so long,'' Lang said. ``I guess
that's what kept your optimism up ... because you'd look out in the
field, and it was still green. You'd think, gee, if you could just
get a half-inch of rain on this.''
   Rain was in short supply everywhere in North Dakota last year,
when about a third of the state's 6.2 million-acre spring wheat
crop was abandoned. Direct crop losses were estimated at more than
$500 million.
   North Dakota State University researchers have pegged this
year's crop losses at $661 million so far, saying the state would
lose 30 percent of its spring wheat and from 26 percent to 42
percent of its durum, barley and hay.
   The 1988 drought ruined Lang's crop. But this spring, in hopes
of plentiful rainfall and prices driven up by grain shortages, he
planted 1,500 acres.
   Now, he estimates he may be able to harvest only about 150 acres.
   There are some bright spots. Lang expects to have enough hay to
feed 150 cattle, and the cattle can graze fields that would be
useless to harvest. The farm is not in danger of foreclosure.
   Wearing jeans and a denim shirt with cut-off sleeves exposing
Popeye-size forearms, Lang maintains a sunny disposition.
   ``I guess I'm more of an optimist,'' he says.
   But he worries whether the federal government, which pumped more
than $400 million in drought aid into North Dakota last year, will
respond again in 1989, when dry conditions are not as widespread
nationwide.
   Lang received about $25,000 in federal drought aid last year.
That aid, along with crop-insurance payments ``helped keep the wolf
off our back,'' he said.
   ``I don't want to see a handout, I'm not begging for a
handout,'' Lang said. ``But you look at what disaster money did to
the economy of North Dakota last year ... Some of the areas, we're
going to need it to keep things going.''

<HEAD>House Easily OKs Bill, Sends It To The Senate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House, with unusual ease, on Friday
approved a $14.3 billion foreign aid bill that sends a warning to
the Philippines to improve its management of aid dollars and begins
President Bush's initiatives in Hungary and Poland to boost private
development.
   With little debate, the lawmakers voted 329 to 69 to appove what
traditionally has been one of the most contentious pieces of
legislation Congress takes up each year. The bill, one of 13 basic
money measures that fund the full array of federal programs, now
goes to the Senate.
   The bill includes $160 million as the U.S. contribution toward
the Multilateral Assistance Initiative for the Philippines, an
effort to bolster the government of President Corazon Aquino with
an influx of development aid.
   But that amount falls below the $200 million pledged to the
program by President Bush. The cut was intended to signal concerns
that money already flowing to the Philippines is not being used or
is being wasted.
   The House Appropriations Committee report accompanying the bill
said the panel ``is deeply concerned about the management crisis in
the Philippine foreign assistance program'' and added that further
cuts will follow if improvements are not made.
   The measure includes $10 million for Poland and $5 million for
Hungary to begin a three-year, $125-million plan announced by Bush
last week to encourage private development in those two East Bloc
countries.
   The bill has substantially greater emphasis on development aid
and less on military assistance than the Bush administration had
sought. Security aid totaled $7.6 billion, a $1.6-billion cut from
the White House request. Development aid was boosted from the $5.3
billion Bush had asked to $6 billion.
   Other allocations in the bill include $3 billion for Israel and
$2.1 billion for Egypt, largely a reward for their participation in
the Camp David Middle East peace process; a maximum of $85 million
in military aid to the newly elected government of El Salvador, led
by Alfredo Cristiani of the right-wing ARENA party; $65 million for
the U.N. Children's Fund, more than double the administration's
request; and a total of $410 million for migration and refugee
assistance, $40 million more than the administration had asked.
   Also earmarked are $20 million for a program to promote peace in
Northern Ireland; $230 million in military aid to Pakistan; $12
million for the West Bank and Gaza strip for education, health and
agriculture programs; and $164 million for the Peace Corps.

   Pinochet, 73, will enter Santiago Army Hospital on Saturday.
   His physician, Henri Olivi, said doctors will determine within
the next few days whether surgery is necessary.

   Two authors journeyed into the vast
wasteland of television and returned with 1,900 gems of wisdom.
There's a little horse sense from Mr. Ed, and leave it to Beaver to
add homespun sagacity.
   Words to live by from the boob tube?
   ``It's true, you just have to search for them,'' said Jack
Mingo, who with John Javna wrote ``Primetime Proverbs: The Book of
TV Quotes,'' published Friday by Harmony Books of New York. ``No
one's ever looked to television for wisdom, but 100 million people
can't be wrong.''
   The cherished quotes, which the authors say already have become
folklore, came from the mouths of Maxwell Smart, Fred Flintstone,
Gilligan and the Skipper, too.
   Among the adages, preserved for literary posterity under 231
topics, are Archie Bunker's summation of the Divine: ``God don't
make no mistakes. That's how he got to be God.''
   Angel Martin of ``The Rockford Files'': ``You can't make one
thin dime giving people what they need. You've got to give 'em what
they want.''
   Mork: ``One man's ceiling is another man's floor.''
   Ted Baxter of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'': ``You know what
makes this country great? You don't have to be witty or clever, as
long as you can hire someone who is.''
   Whitey of ``Leave It to Beaver'': ``You don't need any brains to
grow up; it just happens to ya.''
   There are even sayings from four commercials, which are
seemingly already heard often enough on the tube itself.
   Those include one by Head and Shoulders shampoo, ``You never get
a second chance to make a first impression,'' and another by the
National Enquirer, ``Enquiring minds want to know.''
   Research for the book involved hundreds of hours of TV viewing
by the two San Francisco Bay area writers. They also used 112
volunteer viewers, including Jim Davidson from the National
Association for the Advancement of Perry Mason, a fan club.
   ``The generation that grew up with TV in the '50s and '60s is at
the point it has a lot of disposable income and that's why there's
a lot of TV nostalgia coming out on the market, like this book,''
said Davidson, who also publishes a monthly listing of TV shows
from the '50s.
   Mingo said television doesn't deserve its reputation as an
``idiot box.''
   ``It's always been considered a declasse thing to watch a lot of
TV, so people are reluctant to admit they get anything good from
any of it other than by watching a few hours of public
television,'' he said. ``But we found many things of the sort you'd
find from philosophers, and that you don't expect to see in the
mass media.''
   Not surprisingly, Mingo now often finds himself quoting Mr. Ed,
who was a horse, of course, and once said, ``Never send a man to do
a horse's job.''
   ``People are always happy to hear things straight from the
horse's mouth,'' he deadpanned.

   Stubby water pipes follow the washboard
gravel road twisting through the hills of rural Mississippi,
bringing people a taste of the 20th century they find as
significant as the first human steps on the moon.
   ``When you've had to haul water from a creek or collect
rainwater off the roof all your life, having it brought to your
doorstep is as important to us as when they walked on the moon,''
Charles Savage said this week.
   For now, however, the 36-year-old laborer's bathroom is still an
outhouse.
   Until money can be found to install and hook up indoor plumbing,
Savage's family and others in the community will have to keep
drawing water from the new plastic pipes that stick out of the
ground outside each home.
   A federally financed project completed the main line down the
road two weeks ago, and a church group paid to run pipe to each
home. Now a charity effort is under way to collect used fixtures
and the money to install them.
   Most residents in Blue Hill, named for the forest-covered blue
clay hills in sparsely populated Jefferson County, live in poverty.
Only a couple families have the luxury of a private well.
   Unemployment in the southwest Mississippi county runs 23.4
percent, the highest in the state.
   For Blue Hill residents lucky enough to find work, it's usually
cutting and hauling pulpwood or jobs associated with the
Mississippi River, several miles to the west. Some get work loading
barges. Savage works for a company that lays stabilizing concrete
mats on the river bank.
   A decade-old campaign by a few residents finally paid off when
Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., secured $255,000 from the Farmers Home
Administration so the small Pattison Water System could extend its
line eight miles to Blue Hill.
   ``This week marks 20 years since the United States landed a man
on the moon,'' Espy said. ``It will also mark the first time ever
for many Blue Hill residents to have running water. ... It's time
for Congress to concentrate on moving rural America into modern
times along with the rest of the country.''
   Janie Cole, whose family has a well, led appeals for donations.
She said a church group in Charlotte, N.C., raised $2,800 to hire a
contractor to run water pipes from the main line beside the gravel
road to the spigots just outside homes.
   Then members of the Providence United Methodist Church in
Charlotte brought a truckload of used sinks.
   ``We've got enough sinks, but we're still in need of other
plumbing fixtures and money to complete the piping,'' Mrs. Cole
said.
   Until the money is found, people like Trenessa Moore will do
things the old way.
   ``I get water for cooking and to wash my baby from that
barrel,'' Moore said as she stood on the porch of the weathered
shack that is home to her and her 11-month-old child. ``They ran
the water up to the house about a month ago and gave me a sink, but
I don't have any money to bring the water inside.''
   Moore, 19 and living on welfare, said she hauls water from a
neighbor's well or from the creek to fill the 50-gallon drum beside
her porch.
   ``In a way it's like a dream to think I may soon have an indoor
bathroom,'' Moore said. ``That means I won't have to heat water on
the stove to wash my baby.''
   Mrs. Cole said she and a few other residents appealed for years
to federal officials for help but had little success until two
local legislators helped put her touch with Espy.
   Mary Moore, who is raising her three sons in a trailer home,
doesn't think people in other parts of the country really
understand just what it means for her community to get running
water.
   ``For some, there will be the problem of paying the monthly
water fee, but we've overcome so much and we can overcome the
rest,'' she said. ``I know this sounds crazy, but right now if I
had a million-dollar lottery ticket I would let it go for this
water.''

   They may play in Peoria, but a line of logo
clothes for a local high school won't make it in the rest of the
country.
   A Kansas City, Mo., businessman who purchased the rights to use
the name and insignia of Peoria High School has given up his idea
for a line of clothing.
   ``It was an attempt to create a fad and it didn't happen,'' said
Fred Wolferman. ``It was clearly a long shot.''
   Wolferman said he wanted to market the Peoria High clothing as
an alternative to a Beverly Hills High School line introduced last
year by Twentieth Century Fox and the Great Southern Clothing Co.
of Macon, Ga.
   ``I tried a little test ad in the New Yorker and I didn't get
any response,'' Wolferman said. ``I deduced there was minimal
interest.''
   The idea of a Peoria High line of clothes came from a comment
made by promoters of the Beverly Hills clothing.
   Wolferman said he was offended on behalf of Peoria and the
Midwest when a promoter said his clothes were ``the closest most
kids in Peoria will ever feel they're a part of the Beverly Hills
High School attitude.''

   Jumping a water scooter hasn't
landed anyone in the Guinness Book of World Records, but Bill
``Iceman'' Matthews has taken a leap that he hopes will put him in
the book.
   Matthews made his bid without a practice run.
   ``What's the point?'' he said. ``You've just got to get out
there and do it.''
   Matthews rode a water scooter Thursday over a 20{-foot ramp and
flew 60{ feet into the water, making his jump an official 81 feet.
   He had the jump filmed and plans to submit the tapes to the
Guinness Book. Cyd Smith, a Guinness editor, said no records exist
for water scooters.
   Matthews, who makes a living jumping motorcycles and all-terrain
vehicles over cars and boats, said the jump was the first of a
planned series.

   Communist Party leaders, bemoaning the ideological
confusion in the party under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms, have called for tight restrictions on the press and a
clear second-in-command.
   The party newspaper Pravda on Friday published speeches made
Tuesday by party chiefs depicting ruling Communist cadres cut loose
without a party line and drifting in a sea of contradictions.
   In answer to a speech by Gorbachev encouraging party members to
further perestroika _ his economic and political revival program _
leader after leader complained that party activists were confused
and hampered by opposition forces unleashed by the reforms.
   Leonid F. Bobykin, party chief in Sverdlovsk, told the meeting,
``Things are going not at all the way we expected and the way they
should.''
   ``We don't see a hard line on ideological questions,'' he said.
   Bobykin said the role of the Secretariat of the Central
Committee had been weakened, and ``what's needed, apparently, is a
second secretary of the Central Committee, no matter what that's
called officially.''
   Gorbachev's post as general secretary of the Central Committe
makes him head of the party, but no second-in-command has been
designated. The Politburo member in charge of ideology
traditionally has been viewed as the No. 2 party official, but
leaders have said no one fulfills that role since Yegor K. Ligachev
was replaced as ideology chief last fall.
   The 251-member Central Committee is the policy-making body of
the party. Its Secretariat is charged with day-to-day oversight of
the party apparatus.
   At Tuesday's meeting, Ligachev called for tight party control of
the press and the political arena. He did not directly criticize
Gorbachev, but implied he was taking too light a hand to counter
threats to the party's power and national law and order.
   Ligachev, who now oversees the agricultural sector, asked how
Gorbachev's July 1 speech appealing for peace among the country's
many ethnic groups was received.
   In certain areas, ``it was received with clashes, with people's
deaths,'' he answered.
   At least 17 people have been reported killed this month in
ethnic clashes in the Abkhazia region of the southern republic of
Georgia.
   Ligachev, considered a conservative force in the Politburo, said
``oppositionist, anti-perestroika political organizations with
their own publications'' were gaining strength.
   He ruled out the idea of taking control of the press away from
the party, cautioning that ``in that case, the media will turn into
the dictatorship of certain forces.''
   Bobykin echoed Ligachev's criticism of the media, as did many of
Tuesday's speakers. Bobykin said greater press freedom under
Gorbachev ``leads sometimes not to consolidation, but to
disintegration, distorts the line of perestroika.''
   ``From literature, cinema, and television, the figure of the
laborer, of the laboring workdays of perestroika, has practically
disappeared,'' he said. ``They've become filled with `legal
robbers,' prostitutes, drug addicts, hooligans and dubious
`supermen.'''
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said the Politburo also
appeared alienated at times from the reform process.
   At last month's Congress of People's Deputies, the legislature
that is the centerpiece of Gorbachev's political reforms, ``the
Politburo ended up over on the side, in some kind of isolated
state, as if some paralysis syndrome were at work on it,'' he said.
   ``No one from the Politburo made a speech at the Congress, as is
well known,'' he remarked. ``I think that was our strategic
miscalculation.''
   Ryzhkov also called for the division of labor in the Politburo
to be rearranged to let Gorbachev ``devote more attention to his
party duties.''
   The rank-and-file party members ``don't understand a lot these
days,'' said Moscow party chief Lev N. Zaikov. ``And that makes
them unhappy and passive.

<HEAD>American Released After Washington Complies With Kabul Demand</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government released a jailed
American on Friday after Washington complied with a demand to make
a formal request for his freedom from the regime it does not
recognize.
   Wearing blue pajama-like tunic and trousers, Tony O'Brien was
handed over to a U.S. representative at a ceremony before the
glaring lights of government-run television.
   He hugged her, then threw his hands in the air and shouted: ``I
want to thank God for my freedom.''
   Afghan security forces arrested O'Brien on June 8 at a guerrilla
hideout in the capital after the photographer, on assignment for
Time-Life Inc., entered Afghanistan without valid travel documents
and in the company of Moslem guerrillas.
   O'Brien, 43, of Santa Fe, N.M., was never charged and the
Soviet-backed government agreed to release him without trial. But
it later demanded a formal letter from the U.S. government,
officially requesting his release and authorizing a State
Department representative to escort him out of the country.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said
the Afghan government appeared to be using O'Brien to try to force
the United States into issuing a statement that could be construed
as recognizing President Najib's government as legitimate.
   The United States does not recognize Najib's government and
closed its embassy in Kabul in January before the final withdrawal
of Soviet troops fighting U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   ``They got what they wanted,'' said Renny Smith, the consular
officer who was sent from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi to pick up
O'Brien.
   Ms. Smith said she personally delivered a letter Thursday to
government officials. Another letter was sent by telex from
Washington directly to the Afghan government, she said without
elaborating.
   Ms. Smith made no mention of the Afghan government during the
ceremony.
   ``I am thankful to everyone for what they have done to get Tony
home,'' she said.
   Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said that after his release,
O'Brien stayed at the Turkish Embassy, which is handling his
departure. Turkey is the only NATO country that still maintains an
embassy in Kabul.
   ``The whole issue was that the Afghans wanted the State
Department to send somebody official and the State Department was
reluctant because we don't recognize the Afghan government,'' he
said.
   O'Brien said he had been told only an hour earlier he would be
released.
   ``I want to see my mother. I want to tell her I'm coming home
soon,'' O'Brien said.
   ``I want to go home and play baseball but right now I want to
walk on the streets,'' said O'Brien who spent most of his
confinement in a small cell.
   O'Brien was scheduled to fly to New Delhi, India, on Saturday
and then return home.
   Since his arrest, the government said, it received appeals for
O'Brien's release from Palestine Liberation Organization leader
Yasser Arafat, Time-Life and several U.S. congressmen.
   A French photographer and an Italian photographer captured by
government forces were freed last year, but only after their
governments formally requested their release and dispatched senior
officials to Kabul.
   The clemency pleas by the French and Italian governments were
widely publicized by Kabul as a show of official international
recognition.
   O'Brien crossed into Afghanistan with the guerrillas. He has
been covering the war from the Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar.
   The guerrillas, who are mainly based in neighboring Pakistan,
have been fighting for 11 years to overthrow the government.
   The United States and other Western nations closed their
embassies in Kabul in late January and early February, shortly
before Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan. The Western allies,
who had been pressing for Moscow to end its nine-year military
intervention, cited fears that security would deteriorate after the
Red Army left.

<TEXT>
   U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar
asked government officials Friday to dismiss more than 2,000
Namibia police from a unit accused of war atrocities and harassing
civilians.
   The U.N. secretary general also said he would investigate South
Africa's claims that many political prisoners remain held by the
South-West Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO.
   The independence movement began its guerrilla war against South
African rule of Namibia in 1966 but stopped fighting after an
independence plan was approved last December.
   Perez de Cuellar met with Foreign Minister Pik Botha and two
other Cabinet members Friday after arriving from a three-day trip
to Namibia. While there, he said his request for dismissal of the
controversial police officers was turned town by Louis Pienaar, the
territorial administrator installed by South Africa.
   ``I'm sorry to say I'm not totally satisfied'' with Pienaar's
decision, the U.N. chief said before leaving Namibia, also known as
South-West Africa.
   Despite the dispute, Botha and the U.N. leader predicted the
territory would have elections as scheduled Nov. 6 to establish an
independent government and end 74 years of South African control.
   Perez de Cuellar said the main threat to fair elections
concerned charges of intimidation by Namibian police who belonged
to the disbanded paramilitary unit known as Koevoet, the Afrikaans
word for ``crowbar.''
   ``I want to totally remove the shadow of Koevoet,'' he told a
news conference in Namibia.
   During that territory's war, Koevoet members often went on
weeklong patrols through isolated villages and bush territory in
armored vehicles mounted with machine guns. They were accused of
dozens of atrocities against civilians and guerrillas.
   Koevoet was officially disbanded earlier this year, but more
than 2,000 of its members were integrated into the regular police
force. SWAPO says those members are still harassing its supporters.
   In Lusaka, Zambia, SWAPO President Sam Nujoma said South
African-controlled Namibian troops killed 27 civilians near
Oshakati in northern Namibia.
   He said villagers reported seeing former Koevoet members burying
the victims' corpses after the July 15 killings.
   He called the killings a ``massacre'' but gave no details.
   ``The people were murdered. They (Koevoet) were really caught
red-handed,'' said Nujoma at a news conference.
   Territorial authorities previously acknowledged burying 11
guerrillas but dismissed the report of 27 bodies.
   Nujoma said the killings support SWAPO's demands for an increase
in the strength of U.N. forces supervising the independence plan.
About 4,650 U.N. troops now are stationed in Namibia under the plan.
   Nujoma urged the United Nations to send more troops to Namibia
so its forces ``could be in a position to prevent further South
African massacres of our people and intimidation of voters.''
   SWAPO is favored to win the elections.
   Pienaar met with Perez de Cuellar on Wednesday and announced
that former Koevoet members would be moved from north-central
Namibia into less tense regions. But he says he will dismiss
policemen only if misconduct is proved against them individually.
   Perez de Cuellar also said Friday he was ``very much concerned''
by charges that SWAPO continues to hold large numbers of prisoners
at camps in Angola. Under terms of the U.N. independence plan,
political prisoners on both sides are to be freed, and 24 SWAPO
members were released from a Namibian prison Thursday.
   SWAPO has said it released all 201 detainees it held. But
relatives and the freed detainees have said nearly 2,000 prisoners
were in SWAPO camps.
   The former detainees also say dozens of people were killed in
the camps.
   Perez de Cuellar said he plans to travel to Zambia on Saturday
to confer with President Kenneth Kaunda and Nujoma.

<HEAD>Tibetan Leader Calls China Crackdown Temporary Setback for Tibet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama said Friday that China's
crackdown on the democracy movement is only a temporary setback for
Tibet's fight for autonomy.
   The spiritual leader of Tibetans also said the June 3-4
crackdown on protesters in Beijing should help Chinese understand
the situation in Tibet.
   The Himalayan region annexed by China 40 years ago has been the
scene of numerous clashes in recent years between Tibetan monks,
independence activists and Chinese settlers, police and soldiers.
   The Dalai Lama, concluding a monthlong trip, told a news
conference that for both Tibetan and Chinese pro-democracy
activists, ``eventually things will improve. The desire for
democracy and freedom are basic human desires in the human blood.''
   But he said China's attitude toward dissent following the
Beijing protests ``is much more hard-line, so naturally the
attitude toward Tibet has become harder.
   ``But, while the recent events are very sad, I feel it is a
temporary setback.''
   Later Friday, the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet after an abortive
1959 uprising against Chinese control, received the first Raul
Wallenberg Congressional Human Rights Award. It is named after a
Swedish diplomat who helped save tens of thousands of people from
the Holocaust.
   The Dalai Lama has visited Costa Rica, Mexico, Los Angeles and
New York.
   Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., said the Dalai Lama was honored
because ``he is the quintessential leader of the global trends
toward reconciliation, non-violence and peace.''
   The only difference between Chinese suppression of Tibetans for
40 years and its suppression of its own democracy movement in June
``is that the events in Tiananmen were carried on TV to hundreds of
millions of living rooms around the world,'' Lantos said.
   China says Tibet historically has been part of China, while
Tibetans claim that despite the region's trade, tribute and
religious links to China, it has been fundamentally independent.
   The Dalai Lama said his desire for dialogue with the Chinese
government has not changed despite the crackdown, but he said his
contacts with China through the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi have
been stalled.
   ``We have made a number of proposals through New Delhi, but
there has been no response,'' he said.
   The Dalai Lama's latest proposal calls for Tibet to be
self-governing but for China to remain responsible for its defense
and foreign affairs. China rejected the idea.
   The Dalai Lama, chosen at birth as a reincarnation of the last
Dalai Lama, is revered by Tibetans as the ``god-king'' and symbol
of their motherland.
   ``I am quite popular,'' he said, ``but the system must change.
Without change in this Dalai Lama system, democracy would be very
difficult to achieve and meaningless.''
   Authority for the Dalai Lama, he said, should not just come
naturally, but through election. He must first be qualified to be
the spiritual leader before he becomes the Dalai Lama.
   ``It is nonsense that a young boy, not well qualified, should be
chosen as Dalai Lama to become a spiritual leader.
   ``I never felt that I was the Dalai Lama,'' he said. ``I am a
monk, no more, no less. I am just a monk.''

<TEXT>
   Band leader Xavier Cugat has been
hospitalized after suffering more heart trouble, his doctors said
Friday.
   In a statement, doctors of the 89-year-old musician said he was
responding to treatment and remained in stable condition.
   The doctors at Quiron Hospital here said Cugat was suffering
from failure of a heart valve.
   Long troubled by heart problems, Cugat has had four heart
attacks and a stroke since 1980. He was hospitalized twice last
year for heart and lung ailments.
   Cugat became a U.S. star with his band in the early 1930s.
   They played Latin dance music for movie stars at the Coconut
Grove club in Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel. Cugat later led his
band at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York.
   He is credited for helping to introduce Latin American rhythms
into American dance music.
   He also appeared in several Hollywood movies.
   Cugat was born in 1900 in the northeastern Catalonian town of
Gerona, but immigrated with his family to Cuba when he was a child.
   In 1970, he turned over his band to Tito Puente and a decade
later returned to live in Barcelona.
   In recent years, he occasionally has appeared on Spanish
television to tell stories of his Hollywood days.

   An evenly divided House Ways and Means
Committee failed Friday in a new effort to decide the fate of
catastrophic health insurance for older Americans.
   On an 18-18 vote the committee defeated an amendment by Rep.
Willis Gradison, R-Ohio, that would have allowed a beneficiary to
avoid paying a tax to finance catastrophic coverage so long as he
or she also forfeited Medicare coverage for physicians' fees.
   Medicare coverage of doctors' fees, known as Part B, is heavily
subsidized by the government, although beneficiaries pay a premium
of $27.90 a month. Part B is voluntary, but current law requires
every person eligible for Medicare to enroll in catastrophic.
   Twelve Democrats and six Republicans voted for the amendment; 11
Democrats and seven Republicans voted no.
   The committee ended its work for the week without resolving
another major issue, whether to reduce the tax on capital gains.
Aides said six Democrats and the 13 Republicans favor a plan to
reduce the tax, which applies to profits from the sale of stocks
and other assets.
   President Bush wants a cut in the rate.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the committee chairman, and House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., oppose a reduction because most
of the benefit would go to those with income of more than $100,000
a year. They also fear cutting the rate would be the first step
toward unraveling the massive 1986 tax overhaul, which took away
any preference for capital gains.
   Rostenkowski and Foley, while opposing a rate cut, are exploring
the possibility of cutting capital-gains taxes another way: by
``indexing'' the system so that gains that were caused solely by
inflation are not taxed.
   Catastrophic coverage under Medicare was enacted a year ago to
help insulate older Americans against having their savings eroded
by medical expenses. It is under attack because two-thirds of the
cost of the program is paid by those 65 and older who have enough
income that their federal income taxes exceed $150.
   In 1989, the maximum catastrophic tax is $800, or $1,600 if both
spouses are eligible for Medicare.
   Some who are having to pay the surtax have been complaining so
loudly that congressional leaders say the program will have to be
changed.
   A move for outright repeal was rejected by the Ways and Means
Committee Thursday.
   In addition to defeating the Gradison proposal Friday, the
committee beat a proposal by Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., that would
have eliminated coverage of drugs under the catastrophic plan and
used the money saved to cut the surtax. The surtax rate _ now 15
percent of income taxes over $150 _ would have been cut to about 2
percent, committee aides said.
   The Bush administration, like Rostenkowski, would prefer that
the program be left as is. Committee aides said the administration
supported Gradison's proposal and could support a Rostenkowski
substitute that would keep the program intact but dump a greater
share of the cost onto older people with incomes under $25,000 a
year.

<HEAD>Greek Cypriots Present Petition Demanding Release of Detainees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of women staged a sit-in outside
U.N. offices Friday until they were allowed to present a petition
demanding freedom for Greek Cypriots arrested while protesting the
Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.
   The women, accompanied by a dozen priests, sat outside the
office of the U.N. Force in Cyprus after they were blocked from
marching to the home of Oscar Camilion, the U.N. special
representative in Cyprus.
   They said they would remain until Camilion met with them. Four
hours later, U.N. soldiers allowed a priest and a demonstrator
through. They walked to the U.N. official's residence, about 500
yards away, and handed him the appeal.
   The estimated 500 to 600 demonstrators then dispersed.
   The petition demanded the release of 108 Greek Cypriots detained
Wednesday, the eve of the 15th anniversary of the Turkish invasion.
   The detainees _ 10 men and 98 women _ appeared in a Turkish
Cypriot court Friday and were tried and convicted on charges of
entering a restricted military zone and violating the borders of
the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state. The state, established in
1983, is recognized only by Turkey.
   Sentencing was scheduled Saturday. They face up to 18 months in
prison.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar called for the
release of the detainees and criticized both the Greek Cypriots and
Turkish Cypriots for Wednesday's incident.
   He said that despite previous assurances from Greek Cypriot
authorities, ``events marked by violence and the destruction of
United Nations property were allowed to take place.
   ``It is also unacceptable that the Turkish Cypriot side crossed
the Turkish Force cease-fire line and forcibly took demonstrators
back to their area,'' he said.
   Turkish Cypriot riot police made the arrests after about 1,000
demonstrators broke through U.N. barricades into a buffer zone
between the Greek and Turkish sides.
   About 60 British paratroopers from the seven-nation U.N. Force
in Cyprus formed a human barricade to prevent Friday's marchers
from reaching Camilion's home, on the Green Line that divides the
island into the Turkish and Greek sectors.
   The women then sat on the ground, blocking the entance to the
U.N. office.
   Their petition, read through a bullhorn by one of the
protesters, accused Turkish forces of launching a ``brutal attack
against the unarmed women.''
   It also demanded the withdrawal of 35,000 Turkish troops and
50,000 mainland settlers from northern Cyprus, and the return of
about 200,000 Greek Cypriots who were evicted from northern Cyprus
when the Turks invaded.
   President George Vassiliou conferred with Camilion and
reiterated earlier demands for U.N. action to bring about the
release of the detainees, said government spokesman Akis Fantis.
   Vassiliou also conferred eparately with the diplomatic
representatives of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council: the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France and
China.
   Turkey's Foreign Ministry criticized U.N. peacekeeping troops
for failing to prevent the demonstrators Wednesday from bursting
into the buffer zone.
   The Cypriot demonstrators also criticized the U.N. troops,
saying they did nothing to protect the protesters from the Turks on
Wednesday.

   Yale nuclear physicist D. Allan Bromley,
President Bush's nominee to be White House science adviser, said
Friday he supports several ``big science'' projects but doesn't
want to see them funded at the expense of small grants to
individual researchers.
   Testifying at his confirmation hearing, Bromley also said he
believes there are good chances for an increase in staffing at the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, which
sustained substantial budget cuts during the Reagan administration.
   Bromley told the Senate Commerce Committee he had been assured
by Bush that the president wants to enhance the visibility of the
White House office and to give his science adviser ready access to
the Oval Office.
   In line with this policy, Bromley said Bush was planning to
establish and have regular meetings with a new Council of Science
and Technology Advisers, intended to bring together the best
expertise from a wide range of areas.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., who chaired the hearing, said he
expects ``very speedy approval'' of Bromley's nomination by the
committee and then by the full Senate.
   Bromley said he was committed to supporting the $4.4 billion
Superconducting Super Collider, a 53-mile circumference nuclear
particle accelerator to be constructed south of Dallas, Texas.
   Bromley said he also supports a research megaproject in the life
sciences _ using advanced computer techniques to map all the genes,
which control heredity, comprising the chromosomes within each cell.
   But he expressed reservations about moving ahead immediately
with development of a hypersonic aerospace plane capable of flying
between New York and Tokyo in about two hours.
   ``I happen to believe that the national aerospace plane is an
important project, but at the moment both the (National) Space
Council and Secretary (of Defense Dick) Cheney have agreed that
that would be slowed down,'' he said.
   Bromley told the Senate panel that ``we simply cannot afford, no
matter how attractive, all these megaprojects. We can't afford to
do them all simultaneously.''
   He said that was particularly the case because it would be
``suicidal'' to fund the ``big science'' projects by significantly
cutting funds available for small grants to individual researchers.

   Ten victims of the unrest in Soviet
Georgia are being treated in West Germany, but there were
conflicting accounts Friday as to whether they were exposed to
poison gas.
   The ARD television network reported the patients suffered from
ailments related to an April incident in Georgia when troops used
force to end a pro-reform demonstration.
   ``Preliminary results indicate that the feared chlorine gas of
World War I was also used in addition to tear and irritant gases,''
ARD said.
   But Ingwardt Tauchert, a spokesman for Saarland state's Health
Ministry, said toxicology tests had not determined the kind of gas
the victims were exposed to.
   ``The tests are still being conducted and it would be premature
to make any conclusions about what they were exposed to,'' Tauchert
said in an interview.
   ARD said treatment had been hampered because Soviet officials
have refused to say what kind of gas was used by security forces to
quell unrest in Georgia.
   Tauchert said many of the patients complained of breathing
difficulties and cramps, which he said could also be caused ``by
stress resulting from a traumatic experience.''
   The 10 Soviets arrived in West Germany on July 15 and were taken
to the Homburg University Clinic.
   They are to return home next week. The Homburg clinic agreed to
treat the victims as a humanitarian gesture, Tauchert said.
   ARD said in its report that some of the patients suffered from
depression and that others were barely conscious.
   Tauchert said he could not confirm the ARD report.
   Clinic officials could not be reached for comment on the ARD
report. Calls to the clinic were referred to the Saarland Health
Ministry.
   ARD said West German medical experts are trying to find better
ways of treating an estimated 4,500 people in Georgia who were
injured in the April unrest.
   On April 9, 20 demonstrators were killed by troops in the
Georgian capital of Tbilisi.

   A judge who reviewed the official investigation of
the 1985 air crash in Newfoundland that killed 256 Americans said
Friday it did not find the cause, but reopening it would produce
``the same lonely result.''
   Willard Estey, a retired Supreme Court justice, said the
evidence did not support the conclusions in the report of the
Canadian Aviation Safety Board about what caused the disaster. The
investigation took three years to complete.
   The crash of a chartered Arrow Air DC-8 at Gander killed all 248
American soldiers returning from peacekeeping duty in the Middle
East and the eight American crew members.
   Estey said it would be ``unproductive and sad'' to reopen the
investigation nearly four years after Canada's worst aviation
disaster.
   ``You'll have the same lonely result,'' he said at a news
conference at which his review was released. Estey noted that no
one survived the crash and fire consumed most of the physical
evidence.
   His review found insufficient evidence for the majority
conclusion that ice on the wings was a probable cause and even less
for the minority view that an explosion or fire occurred before the
crash.
   Five of the safety board's nine members approved the majority
report, released last December, and four signed the minority report.
   ``There is nothing in the evidence or the material assembled by
the board or in any of the studies prepared by or for the board
which would indicate that any further inquiry into this accident
almost four years later would determine the cause or causes with
any greater certainty,'' Estey concluded.
   He found evidence for some conclusions reached by the majority,
but none for the ultimate one about the cause. He added in his
review, ``There is almost no evidence which supports any of the
conclusions of the minority.''
   Noting references throughout the report to possible terrorist
involvement, Estey's review said: ``Surmise and speculation inside
and outside these proceedings abound, factual evidence does not.
Nothing indicates any hope of uncovering explanations of this
accident in those areas.''
   The federal government appointed Estey in February to review the
Aviation Safety Board's investigation after criticism of its
conclusions persisted.
   Kenneth Thorneycroft, the board's chairman and a supporter of
the majority opinion, said Estey's review was ``very valid, very
forceful.''
   He said he still believed ice on the wings played a significant
role in the disaster.
   Les Filotas, a board member who signed the minority report, said
circumstances still exist to be investigated ``outside the four
corners'' examined by Estey.
   ``A labyrinth has many more than four corners,'' he said. ``It's
very unfortunate that it's going to be closed off.''

<HEAD>Taiwanese Vessel Rams U.S. Ship As State Department Renews Request
To Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of two Taiwanese vessels suspected of
involvement in the sale of $1.3 million worth of illegal salmon
rammed a U.S. ship shadowing it in the North Pacific, a government
spokesman said Friday.
   Confirmation of the ramming, which did little damage to either
vessel, came as the State Department again asked Taiwan for
permission to board and inspect its two vessels.
   Taiwan's refusal of an initial request touched off sharp
congressional criticsm with some lawmakers demanding that the U.S.
board the vessels regardless of international repercussions and
others suggesting an immediate embargo on Taiwanese fisheries
products.
   Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said that besides the ramming, the
Tawianese vessel identified as the Tong Foong No. 11 dropped a net
in the water in an effort to ``foul the propeller'' of the
following Redfin.
   The Redfin, a 180-foot refrigeratered freighter that was
chartered as part of a six-month sting operation, continued to
track the Tong Foong No. 11 while the Coast Guard cutter Morgenthau
followed the other Taiwanese vessel.
   ``This is a very sticky situation, both logistically and
diplomatically,'' Gorman said. ``Of course we are disappointed they
refused to allow us to board. These guys are stealing our fish.''
   Earlier this week, federal agents arrested two Taiwanese men as
they emerged from a bank vault in Seattle carrying suitcases
containing more than $1 million in cash that they allegedly
received as payment for 500 metric tons of illegally caught salmon.
   The arrests marked the culmination of the sting operation
mounted by several federal agencies.
   At the same time the arrests were being made, the Redfin was
rendezvousing with the Taiwanese vessels north of Midway Island to
complete the sting operation by receiving the illegally caught fish.
   When the captains of the two Taiwanese vessels boarded the
Redfin to arrange details of the transfer they were detained, but
their ships fled as the Morgenthau approached.
   Before the vessels fled, federal agents were able to obtain 40
fish under the guise of inspecting them before the transaction was
completed.
   Officials of the Departments of Commerce, State, Justice and
Defense and the Coast Guard met Friday to discuss Taiwan's initial
refusal to allow boarding.
   A second cable to the Taiwanese was sent late in the day and
congressional sources, who asked to remain anonymous, said it
pointed out the possibility that trade sanctions might be imposed
if Taiwan refused to cooperate.
   The incident is only the latest in a series that have involved
the driftnet fleets of Taiwan, Japan and South Korea which U.S.
industry groups say have depleted salmon runs in the Pacific
Northwest and Alaska because of illegal fishing.

   A ``Miami Vice'' television show about a
prison break wasn't even over when three young men took it to heart.
   ``It was spur of the moment,'' said Bob Cote, director of the
Guilford County Jail.
   Vincent Gager, 16, Charles Johnson, 17, and Dennis Richardson,
18, didn't wait to see how the episode turned out, escaping a few
minutes before the show ended Wednesday night, officials said.
   Gager and Johnson were captured within minutes. Richardson
surrendered Thursday.
   In the television show, inmates escaped during a prison concert
by starting a riot and then hiding in the band's equipment truck.
   The inmates at Guilford, who were awaiting trial on charges of
breaking and entering and larceny, asked a guard to bring them a
broom and mop. When she unlocked the door leading to the day room,
they allegedly jumped her, took her keys and locked her in.
   They escaped by using the keys and then jumping 20 feet to a
roof ledge and another 25 feet to the ground, officials said.
   All three are charged with assault on a custodial officer,
escape and malicious damage to county property.

   Soviet Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, in
uniform complete with 11 rows of ribbons, marched into the House
Armed Services Committee on Friday and said the Kremlin has cut
production of tanks to 1,700 this year.
   He said that is a 40 percent reduction from previous years.
Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., who initiated the Soviet
military adviser's appearance, called the tank figures encouraging
and ``absolutely new.''
   Akhromeyev, telling Congress what he thought about military
subjects, also said the United States could block all arms control
progress if it refuses to negotiate cuts in the size of the U.S.
Navy.
   In addition, he said that if Washington goes ahead with a
space-based missile shield ``it won't make any sense'' for the
superpowers to cut back on long-range missiles.
   The appearance of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's top
military adviser at the witness table was unprecedented on Capitol
Hill.
   In testimony often touched with flashes of humor, Akhromeyev
used his opportunity to outline the Soviet Union's military posture
and negotiating ideas.
   He was asked by Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif., if U.S. intelligence
estimates are correct when they peg Soviet tank production at more
than 4,000 a year.
   ``Completely unrealistic,'' Akhromeyev said. He said the correct
figure is 1,700 tanks in 1989 and that is a 40 percent cut from
previous years.
   He said tank production will be even lower next year.
   The statistics are of interest to the NATO alliance because
tanks are involved in the offensive threat posed by Soviet forces
to Western Europe.
   ``Ask him about some other production figures,'' Aspin told
Dornan. ``You've got him on a roll.''
   Aspin said the Defense Intelligence Agency had estimated Soviet
tank production at at least 4,200 tanks.
   Akhromeyev said he had anticipated the tank question but had not
bought other production figures. But he said further figures might
be forthcoming because ``everything is possible in the future.''
   Akhromeyev repeatedly said the Soviet Union suspects the United
States is interested in large cuts in conventional land forces in
Europe in order to gain overall military superiority over Moscow by
maintaining the size of its navy.
   The Kremlin fears, he said, that after such a conventional arms
reduction agreement, the United States would build up its naval
forces ``without any constraints, especially its carrier battle
groups.''
   Thus, he said, the United States would ``gain military
superiority in order to dictate its will to the U.S.S.R. from a
position of strength.''
   He reported on Soviet military spending and troop strength,
ticked off missile and warhead totals, and when askd a question
that he didn't want to answer, said the Soviet Union and the United
States both have secrets.
   ``Never has so high-ranking a Soviet official appeared before a
congressional committee,'' said Aspin, who initiated the appearance.
   Akhromeyev was chief of the Soviet general staff and his
nation's top military officer before retiring last year to become
Gorbachev's military adviser.
   ``Through the years we have seen many uniforms sit at that table
_ but never one like yours,'' Aspin said, looking at the Soviet
marshal's olive-brown uniform jacket trimed with red.
   On the wall behind Akhromeyev were the flags of the American
Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps, and the walls to his right
and left bore the portraits of former chairmen of the committee.
   ``If one or two of them look a little uncomfortable,'' Aspin
said, ``you will have to understand that these quickly changing
times take some getting used to.''
   In his prepared statement, read with the help of an interpreter,
Akhromeyev spoke of what he called the ``unjust'' U.S. refusal to
negotiate.
   ``If you follow this line, no drastic reductions of the armed
forces and armaments in the world will be possible,'' he said.
   Offering a detailed accounting of Soviet military spending,
Akhromeyev got into a lively exchange with Aspin on why U.S.
estimates and Soviet figures differ.
   The Soviet adviser pegged his country's military spending this
year at 8.4 percent of the Soviet gross national product or 77.3
billion rubles, saying the United States will spend 5.4 percent of
its GNP for that purpose.
   Aspin said that even when the difference between dollars and
rubles is accounted for, U.S. experts estimate Soviet military
spending at about twice that much.
   Akhromeyev had a ready explanation.
   ``The thing is that in the Soviet Union, in such sectors as raw
materials, the costs do not match the real prices that should be
charged,'' he said.
   ``I do think that its very possible that when prices ... are
restructured it may well be you come up with different figures,''
he said.
   ``We have to tell you the figures I have given you are real
figures and they are genuine figures, in terms of how we calculate
prices today,'' he added.
   He said his country spent $7 billion on personnel pay this year
compared with $78 billion for the United States. ``The United
States is more wealthy than the Soviet Union,'' he said. ``Your
generals and admirals can demand much higher pay.''
   Rep. G. V. Montgomery, D-Miss., asked with a grin whether
Akhromeyev was suggesting cutting the salaries of the American
officers.
   ``Oh God forbid,'' Akhromeyev replied. ``I don't want you to get
me into a fight with American generals and admirals. I just started
becoming friends with them recently.''
   He was complimented on his sense of humor and replied: ``Humor
is very dangerous for me.''

<HEAD>EPA Stopped Oil Study as Senate Panel Neared Drilling Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency stopped
work on a report about oil drilling damage in Alaska just before a
Senate committee was to vote on opening the state's Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge to drilling, EPA officials said Friday.
   Sylvia Lowrance, director of EPA's solid waste office, said she
issued a stop-work order on the report about the damages wastes
from drilling were causing to Alaska's North Slope because she
found a preliminary draft ``poorly written and organized.''
   The report concluded that oil wastes seeping from drilling pads,
leaking chemical drums and overflowing waste disposal pits were
seriously damaging the environment in the Prudhoe Bay area.
   ``Although it appeared to contain a good deal of information, it
was difficult to distinguish governmental views from those of other
sources,'' Ms. Lowrance told the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials.
   But the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio,
alleged that EPA may have suppressed the report ``because its
disclosure to the public embarrassed the EPA top brass who
sympathized with the oil industry.''
   Ms. Lowrance issued the stop-work order on the report on March 6
_ a week before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
was to vote on opening up 1.5 million acres of the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge to drilling.
   Located about 70 miles east of the Prudhoe Bay field now
responsible for about 22 percent of the nation's oil production,
the area is viewed by petroleum geologists as the last major
untapped oil field in North America.
   The Senate panel in mid-March approved a phased program for oil
and gas leasing in the refuge, but the legislative effort quickly
ground to a halt after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill on March
24.
   EPA officials in Ms. Lowrance's office said they recommended on
April 11 that work on the North Slope report be resumed. It was
published in June.
   ``Both reports concluded there are problems with waste
management on the North Slope,'' Ms. Lowrance said.
   But she said the second report cites specific cases of damages
needed by government regulators to justify crafting ``any
regulatory changes judged necessary.'' Those specifics were missing
in the original draft, she said.
   Other EPA officials also noted that the second report put more
emphasis on efforts by state officials in Alaska to address the
problem of hazardous wastes from oil drilling.
   The North Slope report is the first of nine commissioned by the
EPA to develop guidelines for state regulators on controlling
wastes from oil and natural gas drilling.
   The reports were commissioned after the agency declared last
summer that drilling wastes do not fall into a ``hazardous''
category requiring regulation by the federal government.
   Congress in 1980 specifically exempted the oil, gas and mining
industries from federal hazardous waste regulation but ordered EPA
to study the issue with specific directions to weigh how much it
would cost them if covered.
   EPA estimated the cost to the oil industry of meeting hazardous
waste standards at $200 million to $500 million a year, but said
they could go much higher if drillers also had to pay for cleaning
up past disposal sites.

   China said Friday it will allow Hong Kong to
remain capitalist after reverting to Beijing rule in eight years
only if its residents stop supporting the mainland's crushed
democracy movement.
   China also showed its determination to control its unruly
student population by announcing a deep cut in the size of the
nation's college freshman class for the fall. The cuts were largest
at schools whose students played leading roles in seven weeks of
protests for a freer society.
   In other developments:
   _ The Beijing Tourism Administration ordered the city's hotels
to cut employees' salaries by up to 25 percent starting this month,
sources at several hotels said. Hotels have been nearly deserted
since the crackdown frightened away most tourists.
   _ Leading dissident Fang Lizhi, who is hiding in the U.S.
Embassy, has been expelled from his posts in the Dialectics
Research Society, an official report said. Fang, an astrophysicist,
worked in the Beijing Observatory, but repeated phone calls to
determine if he had been fired as well were unanswered.
   _ Eighteen employees of a China-funded newspaper in Hong Kong
announced their resignations to protest last Saturday's firing of
the publisher, who criticized the crackdown in China. The newspaper
had long supported China but joined other Hong Kong publications in
denouncing the crackdown.
   Hong Kong residents have helped smuggle movement activists to
the West and pledged money to help them oppose the Chinese leaders
who ordered soldiers to attack demonstrators in Beijing on June 3-4.
   But a commentary in the Communist Party newspaper, the People's
Daily, accused Hong Kong activists of sabotaging the
Chinese-British agreement that calls for the enclave to remain
capitalist for at least 50 years after it reverts to mainland rule
in 1997.
   ``We will not allow people to use Hong Kong as a base for
subverting the central people's government,'' it said.
   ``Not engaging in activities to overthrow (the Chinese
government) is a pre-condition for allowing (Hong Kong) to retain
its capitalist system.''
   It added: ``Hong Kong compatriots, be vigilant, do not allow any
plot that would sabotage 'one country, two systems' to succeed.''
   Hong Kong residents, already nervous by the mainland crackdown,
were unlikely to be reassured by the commentary, which apparently
was written by a high-level official. It was signed with an obvious
pseudonym, Ai Zhong, two characters that sound the same as the
words ``Love China.''
   Other major commentaries written under pseudonyms have appeared
in recent days, in a revival of the Cultural Revolution practice of
top officials disguising their work.
   The People's Daily essay received immediate, wide publicity in
Hong Kong, where it led evening television newscasts.
   ``The force of the wind tests the strength of the grass,''
activist Szeto Wah, one of those criticized by People's Daily, told
a news conference in Hong Kong. ``This is the time to see how
strong our backbone is.''
   Allen Lee, a senior member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council,
said residents of the colony should not interfere in Chinese
affairs but that China also should ``get used to us, that this is a
free society.''
   Martin Lee, who with Szeto heads the newly formed Hong Kong
Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China,
said China was trying to frighten people from joining the group.
   The alliance has pledged $156,000 to help fugitives from the
mainland. The People's Daily accused it of seeking to overthrow the
communist government.
   Szeto denied the charge, saying he opposed China's current
leaders but not socialism. He and Martin Lee are members of a joint
Hong Kong-Chinese committee that is drafting a basic law to govern
Hong Kong after 1997.
   A second committee in charge of gathering public opinion on the
draft resumed its work Thursday after halting it following the June
3-4 army attack. Despite appeals from Hong Kong for an extension in
view of the crackdown, China insists a final draft must be ready in
January.
   Meanwhile, China's State Education Commission said it was
cutting the size of the nation's college freshman class, from the
planned 640,000 to 610,000.
   It said reasons for the cut, announced on state-run TV, included
problems in job placement and weak college management. Social
science courses should be revised, it said, ``to be in accordance
with the needs of building socialism,'' and emphasis should be put
on professional training instead of college education.
   College admissions officials put it more bluntly, saying the cut
was ordered because of the student movement. Beijing University,
China's most prestigious school and the center of the movement,
will have its freshman class cut from a planned 2,100 to 600.
   High school graduates took their college entry exams last week,
and results have yet to be announced.

<HEAD>Government Revises Farm Fertilizer Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department retreated Friday
from a much-criticized proposal to regulate anhydrous ammonia as a
poisonous gas and offered a compromise to change only the labeling
on tanks of the commonly used fertilizer.
   Agricultural groups and farm-state lawmakers opposed the
department's original 1987 proposal to change the regulatory
classification of anhydrous ammonia, saying it would drive up
prices of the nitrogen fertilizer for farmers by increasing
shipping and insurance costs.
   In the face of those objections, the department unveiled a new
proposal that would continue to classify anhydrous ammonia as a
``nonflammable gas'' but require tanks and other containers to
carry an ``Inhalation Hazard'' label. The new marking would be in
addition to the ``nonflammable gas'' label currently required.
   The original proposal would have required anhydrous ammonia to
carry a warning placard of ``Inhalation Hazard'' and a white
diamond sign with a skull and crossbones.
   The agency will publish its latest proposal in the Federal
Register next week and will open a 90-day period for comment. A
final decision on the regulatory rulemaking would be made later
although there is no deadline, according to a department spokesman.
   On Capitol Hill, farm-state lawmakers applauded the department's
compromise.
   ``We'll live with this,'' said Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., who
helped lead congressional opposition to the poisonous gas
classification. ``We finally got the message through and won a
little victory.''
   Farmers apply anhydrous ammonia directly to the soil, with corn
and wheat producers among the main farm users.
   Although there is no dispute that anhydrous ammonia can cause
injury or even death if it is inhaled at high concentrations,
opponents of the regulatory change argued that the pronounced odor
of the gas acts as a warning even at low concentrations and helps
prevent undue exposure in the event of a leak or accident.

<TEXT>
   From the neon on top to the chiseled granite at
street level, the RCA Building is becoming the GE Building.
   For the last two weeks, workers have been changing signs on the
70-story limestone landmark in the heart of Manhattan to reflect
General Electric's purchase of RCA and its network television
division, NBC, in 1986.
   On Friday, workmen at the 50th Street entrance were removing a
slab of stone with ``RCA Building'' carved into it. Parts of the
red neon letters ``RCA'' facing south and west from the building in
Rockefeller Center have been dismantled.
   They will be replaced by the red neon letters ``GE'' by
September, officials say.
   The building, which holds NBC headquarters, is owned by
Rockefeller Center, but the change needed the approval of the city
Landmarks Preservation Commission.
   That panel also got to help pick the new signs, a design
inspired by an old General Electric logo, said Sue Gould, a partner
in the graphics company that designed the signs.
   ``I guarantee you a lot of people aren't going to notice,'' Ms.
Gould said.

<HEAD>World Rice Trade May Reach Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World rice trade is headed for a record this
year, fueled by huge orders from China, Indonesia and India, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   ``China has already purchased approximately 950,000 metric tons
from Thailand and is forecast to import 1.2 million from all
sources by the end of the year, triple the amount imported in
1988,'' the department's Economic Research Service said.
   ``However, it is unclear how or if the current turmoil in China
will affect its short-term rice trade,'' the agency added in its
report.
   U.S. rice exports in calendar 1989 are expected to rise more
than 10 percent from last year, but Thailand is the major
beneficiary of the larger demand. Thailand's total exports are
expected to be at a record of 5.5 million tons, up 15 percent.
   The United States is expected to account for about 19 percent of
this year's global rice trade and Thailand 41 percent, both
unchanged from last year.
   ``China is expected to be a net importer for the first time in
recent history,'' the report said. ``There have been few reports of
(Chinese) exports in the first half of 1989, and China is forecast
to export only 300,000 tons by the end of the year, less than half
the amount it exported in 1988.''

<TEXT>
   About 100 U.S. Marines staged a mock
invasion on a beach in this Lake Superior city on Friday, and eight
protesters who entered the area were tackled and arrested,
officials said.
   More than 1,000 people watched as the Marines, taking part in an
annual 21-city military recruiting tour of the Great Lakes, used
amphibious tanks from the USS Boulder to reach the beach on
Minnesota Point.
   The area is a narrow strip of land that separates Duluth Harbor
and Superior Bay from Lake Superior.
   Police Chief Eli Miletich said seven people were arrested when
they broke through a 4-foot-high fence as the amphibious vehicles
were just a few yards from landing. An eighth person was arrested
about a half-hour before the Marines landed after she went over
police barriers, he said.
   All eight were to be charged with disorderly conduct, Miletich
said.
   Police tackled most of the protesters who broke the barrier,
including an elderly man who tried to dodge police but was
apprehended in the water as the crafts rode up.
   There were no injuries reported.
   On the beach, the Marines crawled forward and fired blanks
toward the crowd. Many peace activists feigned death while some
Marine supporters cheered and yelled, ``Thank you, Marines.''
   At times, the two factions of observers got into shouting
matches.
   LaVeryn McKeever of Duluth, whose husband served with the
Marines in Korea and whose son died as a Marine in Vietnam, said
controversy over the mock invasion gave her incentive to greet the
Marines.
   ``I vowed that these boys would be welcome,'' she said.
   ``I think it's great,'' said Ann Slaughter of Duluth, who wore a
USMC cap. ``It just makes your heart beat 10 times over.''
   Peace activists gathered on the opposite side of the harbor
early Friday morning. Some carried a ``SANE-Freeze'' banner,
referring to the name of the anti-nuclear arms group, and others
carried signs that read, ``Arms are for Hugging,'' and ``Peace is
Patriotic.''
   ``It's a lie. It's not training. The Marines get very little
training out of this,'' said Charles Wolden of Superior, Wis., who
served four years in the Marines in Vietnam and 12 years in the
U.S. Air Force before leaving the military.
   ``I feel war is wrong, wrong for society,'' Wolden said. ``The
Marines don't show the trauma, the confusion, the effects of war''
with the mock invasion, he said.
   Around mid-morning, about 100 peace activists began what they
called a ``peace walk'' to a park near the harbor.
   As part of its recruiting program, the Navy has docked a ship in
Duluth annually for years, but this is the first time in a decade
that it has brought the Marines along for a mock invasion,
according to Sgt. Stephen Frank, a Marine spokesman in Minneapolis.
   In early June, members of several religious and peace groups and
City Council President Joyce Benson got the Navy to cancel the
landing. Then a Veterans of Foreign Wars member in St. Paul
suggested ``dumping Duluth'' from future VFW festivities.
   Duluth veterans then succeeded in getting the City Council to
ask the Navy to stage the recruiting exercise and the Navy accepted.

<HEAD>Surgeon Contradicts Mystery Pilot's Theory of Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard flight surgeon who first
treated pilot Thomas Root said he found an infection in Root's
abdomen, suggesting his bullet wound occurred hours before his
plane crashed.
   Capt. James Rahman, who accompanied rescuers sent to pluck the
36-year-old lawyer from Bahamian waters following an 800-mile
flight down the East Coast, said the shooting could have occurred
four to eight hours before the July 13 crash.
   Rahman based the opinion on the extent of peritonitis, an
infection that can be caused by a ruptured intestine.
   Root, who claims he passed out at the controls and rode on
autopilot for nearly four hours until the single-engine Cessna ran
out of fuel, has not been able to explain how he received the
bullet wound.
   ``I do not believe that the ... peritonitis that I observed
could have developed in less than two hours and most likely has
been present for somewhat longer, say four to eight hours,'' Rahman
wrote in a report to the National Transportation Safety Board,
which is investigating the incident.
   Root was treated for shock and blood loss by Rahman, but the
bullet wound was not detected until he was transferred to Memorial
Hospital in Hollywood. Root was listed in satisfactory condition on
Friday.
   Root is expected to remain hospitalized for at least a week to
undergo medical and psychological tests requested by his family,
said his brother, Todd Root.
   Thomas Root claims he blacked out about two hours after leaving
Washington National Airport en route to Rocky Mount, N.C. He
theorizes that a .32-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver in the cabin
fired when he crashed.
   In Miami, safety board regional director Jorge Prellezo said
investigators are reviewing radar data to account for every
movement of Root's plane from takeoff until his final radio
transmission in which he reported trouble breathing.
   Prellezo said there are no plans to salvage the plane, which
sank in mile-deep water.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. attorney's office in Miami is reviewing
reports on an FBI interrogation of Root.
   A source close to the investigation said it probably would
examine whether Root filed false information about his flight or is
liable for search and rescue expenses.
   Todd Root said his brother was distressed by reports of possible
drug links.
   Members of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration-led task force
collected information about Root after an April 24 seizure at his
airport hangar of a can of ether and about three dozen guns, all
but one legally registered. No investigation was launched based on
the facts gathered, said DEA spokesman Mario Perez.

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two early one-act plays by August Wilson,
winner of the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, will debut at the
World Theater in September.
   ``The Coldest Day of the Year'' and ``The Homecoming'' will be
produced by Judy Oliver, Wilson's wife, and directed by Claude
Purdy.
   Both plays date from about 1976, when Wilson was living in
Pittsburgh and beginning to change his focus from poetry to writing
plays. Purdy described The ``Coldest Day of the Year'' as a
transitional piece.
   ``Many of his concerns as a poet are in this one,'' Purdy said.
   ``The Homecoming,'' he said, deals with the same themes as ``Ma
Rainey's Black Bottom,'' the 1984 drama that catapulted Wilson to
national prominence.
   Wilson also is the author of ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone,''
``The Piano Lesson,'' and ``Fences.''

<HEAD>Congress to Consider Arms Loan to Colombia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress will decide the fate of a proposed
$170 million government guarantee for a loan to help Colombia buy
arms to fight drug traffickers, the U.S. Export-Import Bank said
Friday.
   Ann Frey, a press officer for the bank, said the loan would be
the first with the bank's support. The usual purpose of its loans
and guarantees is to encourage the sale of U.S. goods in other
countries.
   She said the proposal went to Congress on Wednesday. If no
objection is raised in 25 days it will go through automatically,
she added.
   The bank's announcement said that on July 13 the State
Department decided that the arms sought by Colombia are primarily
for use against narcotics and their sale would be in the interest
of the United States.
   The bank used to be barred from helping the sale of arms. The
Anti-Drug Abuse Act passed last year lifted that ban on sales to
Third World countries. This would be the first loan under the new
law.
   Colombia is a major source of cocaine and marijuana used in this
country. Guerrilla groups fighting the government sometimes ally
themselves with the drug lords and sometimes oppose them. The U.S.
law authorizes help to the sale of arms if they are to be used
primarily against the narcotics trade.
   A guarantee by the government bank would enable commercial banks
to provide Colombia's Ministry of Defense with a lower interest
rate to buy $200 million worth of helicopters, river patrol boats,
aeronautical, transport and communications equipment, arms,
ammunition and other military items.

   ``The McLaughlin Group'' does not need to
provide equal time to political candidates whose opponents appear
on the show in videotaped news clips, the Federal Communications
Commission said Friday.
   The commission, in a 3-0 vote, upheld a decision by the FCC's
mass media bureau that the show's ``news reporting segments'' of
candidates may qualify as newscasts and therefore are exempt from
the equal opportunity requirements of the 1934 Communications Act.
   Oliver Productions, the show's producer, asked in October 1988
that the commission make such a ruling, which follows earlier FCC
decisions exempting interview shows such as ``The MacNeil@Lehrer
NewsHour'' and ``Meet the Press'' from the equal opportunity
provision.
   Oliver attorney David Liebowitz said ``we're gratified'' with
the ruling. He said the show's use of clips may be unique and that
the FCC's decision may not apply to other news-talk shows.
   On ``The McLaughlin Group,'' host John McLaughlin briefly
introduces a ``news reporting segment'' that uses videotaped news
clips of candidates. Oliver told the commission the clips are
selected on the basis of their news value.
   Oliver said there was no intent to advance the candidacy of any
particular individual.
   The Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a
Washington-based advocacy group, argued that the bureau had
misinterpreted the strictures of the Communications Act.
   But the commission agreed with the bureau's conclusion that the
``news reporting segments'' satisfied all the criteria for the
newscast exemption and, therefore, that the segments were exempt
from the equal opportunity provisions of the act.
   Section 315 of the Communications Act says that if a broadcaster
permits a legally qualified candidate for public office to use a
station's facilities, it must give equal opportunities to all other
candidates for that office.
   But Congress in 1959 amended the act to exempt newscasts, news
interviews shows, documentaries in which the candidate's appearance
is incidental to the subject being covered and on-the-spot news
events.

<TEXT>
   A state task force Friday conditionally
approved spending nearly $4.5 million on the University of Utah's
fledgling cold-fusion research program.
   The nine-member State Fusion-Energy Council voted unanimously to
give the university the money once a final, line-by-line review of
the school's proposed fusion budget is completed.
   Once that is done, probably in a week or so, the proposal will
go back to the full panel for final approval.
   Since March, when University of Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons and
British colleague Martin Fleischmann announced they'd achieved a
sustained nuclear fusion reaction in a laboratory flask, scientists
have attempted to duplicate the experiment with mixed results.
   A federal energy panel recommended July 12 against new
government efforts to verify the research, saying there was no
convincing evidence of a new nuclear fusion process that would be a
useful source of energy.
   Despite sharp criticism from the scientific community,
university officials steadfastly have defended the experiments to
the council, which is charged with deciding whether to disburse a
$5 million legislative appropriation toward further research.
   As part of its two-year budget request, the university asked
funding for research, laboratory space, recruitment of outside
scientists, administration and other costs, said James Brophy, the
school's vice president for research.
   Before the vote, university President Chase Peterson urged the
council to act quickly to keep Utah from relinquishing its lead in
the development of fusion as an energy source and to avoid losing
potentially lucrative commercial contracts.
   ``Utah has an opportunity ... to become a leader in the nation
in developing a new science concept,'' he said.
   Fusion involves the combining of atoms _ as contrasted with
fission, or the splitting of atoms, that is used to produce nuclear
power.
   Pons and Fleischmann have said their experiments have produced
up to 150 times the energy put into them, generating the excess
heat that is considered key to fusion's potential as an alternative
energy source.

   Texas oilman Nelson Bunker Hunt blamed his
bank creditors Friday for forcing on him and his brothers a
partnership to handle the repayment of his enormous silver debts, a
deal now at the heart of a $300 million dispute with the Internal
Revenue Service.
   The IRS contends the partnership was a sham.
   Hunt said the banks ``pretty much took over for a while and
dictated'' his affairs after Silver Thursday, the day in late March
1980 when silver prices tumbled from a high of $50 an ounce to $10
an ounce.
   ``The net effect was we didn't have have control over our
business. That's why I'm sitting here in court because the
structure the banks put us in,'' Hunt told U.S. Tax Court Judge
Jules G. Korner III.
   ``You ought to get the money from them,'' Hunt told government
attorney Deborah Butler.
   Hunt is contesting $155 million in 1982 taxes the IRS claims are
due from the dissolution of the partnership he and his brothers set
up after Silver Thursday to repay as much as $2 billion on their
soured silver investments.
   Brother William Herbert Hunt is contesting more than $158
million in 1982 taxes, while Lamar, owner of the Kansas City Chiefs
football team, is contesting $505,377.
   Bunker, the first of the brothers to testify in the non-jury
trial, said he could not recall whether the partnership agreement
between the brothers and the family's flagship firm, Placid Oil
Co., was five or 5,000 pages long.
   ``If it was 5,000 pages, I didn't read it in great detail,'' he
said. ``I won't say I blindly signed it. The deal was explained to
me by the lawyers.''
   But he does remember Walter Fraker, Placid's vice president and
chief financial officer, telling him that the banks ``were calling
all the shots, it was pretty much their party.''
   He also complained that Elvis Mason, then chairman of the board
and chief executive officer of what was then First National Bank of
Dallas, ``was carrying a heavy stroke. He was very dictatorial in
his actions with regard to the loan.''
   Under a March 14, 1980, Federal Reserve directive, banks were
not allowed to make loans on silver investments.
   Placid, however, was able to borrow $1.1 billion from a
consortium of banks in a deal that Mason helped broker. Placid
kicked in $824 million of that loan into the partnership with the
brothers. The Hunts in turn contributed their silver holdings, 2
billion tons of North Dakota coal reserves, gold stocks and other
assets.
   Hunt said he thought the silver contributed to the partnersip
was undervalued at $14.05 an ounce, but said that while he did the
best he could ``I was not in a very strong position.''
   ``I felt it was an unfair deal. I felt it was loaded in favor of
Placid to my detriment,'' Hunt said.
   However, Hunt said his debts were ultimately repaid.
   The IRS contends the partnership was a sham, and that the value
of the coal was only about $16 million in 1980, compared with the
Hunts' claim that it was worth $294 million. When the partnership
dissolved in 1982, the Hunts said was worth $262 million; the IRS
says it was only worth $6.7 million.

<HEAD>Carmelite Leader Sees 8-Year Delay in Building Convent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Polish Carmelite nuns said the entire
nation opposes moving a convent from the edge of the wartime
Auschwitz death camp, despite an agreement with Jewish groups to do
so, a magazine reported Friday.
   In Paris, a Jewish religious leader involved in negotiating the
agreement more than two years ago said talks with Roman Catholic
leaders about the convent would be suspended because, he said,
promises had not been kept.
   Under an agreement signed in February 1987, the nuns were to be
moved from their convent to an interfaith center to be built
farther from the camp. Catholic authorities in Poland say there has
been a delay in constructing a new home for the nuns.
   In Warsaw, the official Polish news agency PAP said Friday that
work would begin next year on a convent more than one-third of a
mile from the camp.
   The Rev. Dominik Wider, provincial superior of the Carmelites,
said building a new convent might take eight years.
   He said in a interview with the Catholic monthly 30 Giorni (30
Days) that his order had accepted the church decision to move the
convent, but ``it is evident that whoever wants to move the nuns
must construct another convent adequate for the needs of their
life.''
   In Poland, Wider said, such a project ``could take around eight
years.''
   ``The idea of transferring the nuns from the cloistered convent
of Auschwitz faces the opposition of the entire Polish society,
which is convinced that the convent doesn't harm anyone and that it
is in the correct place: It is outside the walls of the camp but at
the same time borders it,'' he said.
   The magazine, which is to publish the interview in its next
issue, released excerpts Friday.
   Jews consider locating the convent at the former Nazi
concentration camp an intrusion of Christian symbols on a site
where an estimated 2.5 million Jews were put to death.
   Last week, workers beat an American rabbi and six students who
protested on the ground of the convent, where 14 Carmelite nuns
live.
   Theo Klein, former president of the Representative Council of
Jewish Institutions of France, told reporters in Paris he had
notified Cardinal Albert Decourtray, head of the French Conference
of Bishops, of the decision to cease talks on the convent.
   In the letter, Klein said he considered it ``impossible to
pursue the Judeo-Catholic dialogue at the desirable level, while
the concrete facts with which we are confronted are in such
contradiction with the words.''
   Klein and Decourtray played leading roles in negotiating the
agreement to move the nuns.
   Church leaders have said the delay was due to difficulties in
buying land and arranging for construction. Decourtray issued a
statement Friday apologizing for the delay and saying the church
remained committed to moving the convent as soon as possible.
   In its report Friday, PAP said the first part of the land had
been bought in early July, ``so that, having submitted plans and
having received permission, work can start in the beginning of next
year.''

   A federal judge ruled Friday that a midshipman
who resigned from U.S. Naval Academy after acknowledging his
homosexuality can sue to challenge the school's policy of forcing
such people out of the academy.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch rejected the Defense
Department's attempt to have the suit by Joseph C. Steffan thrown
out of court.
   Steffan, of Warren, Minn., resigned from the academy in March
1987, six weeks before he was scheduled to graduate. He had been
the subject of an investigation of his alleged homosexuality.
   He told academy officials that he was a homosexual and was told
that service officials would seek his dismissal. Instead, he
resigned.
   Steffan is seeking to be readmitted to the Naval Academy in
Annapolis, Md. His suit seeks to have declared unconstitutional the
academy's regulations barring homosexuals.
   Gasch's order offered no opinion on the merits of Steffan's case.
   The Navy had sought an order from Gasch throwing the case out of
court because the service claimed Steffan had voluntarily resigned
and also had not exhausted all his administrative remedies.
   But Gasch said the resignation was not truly voluntary because
Steffan resigned in the face of pressure from academy officials.
   Sandra Lowe, Steffan's attorney, said ``I am delighted with the
ruling because it means we can now argue the case on its merits.''
   Navy officials, asked for comment, did not immediately return
telephone calls.

   About 10 men sprayed the officers with submachine guns and fled
after taking the arms the officers were carrying, police said. Some
of the attackers fled in a car with a rooftop light similar to the

   The civil rights movement risks losing its
``cordial relationship'' with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh by
opposing William Lucas's nomination to head the Justice
Department's anti-discrimination unit, the agency's chief spokesman
said Friday.
   Thornburgh's spokesman, David Runkel, also charged that Rep.
John Conyers, D-Mich., buckled under the pressure of civil rights
lobbyists when he withdrew his endorsement of Lucas to be assistant
attorney general for civil rights.
   ``The pressure on Mr. Conyers from the civil rights community
was enormous,'' Runkel said, a day after Conyers announced he no
longer supported Lucas, a 61-year-old black Republican from
Michigan.
   Not so, said a Conyers spokesman, who told a reporter his boss
had made his decision ``in the loneliness of his own conscience.''
   Despite the loss of a key Lucas supporter and the prospect of a
close vote on the Judiciary Committee, Runkel said, ``I feel
comfortable we have the votes to get the guy confirmed.''
   Asked if winning a possibly tough Senate fight was worth the
political bloodshed, Runkel said:
   ``I think you should address it to the civil rights groups. They
are the ones who have the most to lose.''
   ``They have stated their views, what they have to lose, it seems
to me, is a cordial relationship with the attorney general and with
the head of the civil rights division,'' Runkel said when asked if
his statement could be interpreted as a threat to Lucas' opponents.
   The White House continued to express its support for Lucas.
   ``We think he's an excellent candidate,'' said presidential
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Thornburgh, vacationing in New England, said in a statement
issued by his office that during his testimony, ``Bill Lucas ably
demonstated his ability to serve as assistant attorney general in
charge of the Civil Rights Division.''
   ``In keeping with President Bush's commitment in this area, Mr.
Lucas pledged to serve as the administration's lead official in the
close monitoring of the impact of recent Supreme Court decisions on
civil rights.''
   Thornburgh said Lucas ``accurately reflected my views when he
said he would `lead the charge' in seeking legislative changes if
these cases do, in fact, hamper effective civil rights
enforcement.''
   The vote on Lucas' nomination in the Judiciary Committee is
expected to be very close and along party lines. Democrats have an
8-6 margin on the panel, which has not scheduled a vote on the
nomination.
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said
Thursday he is inclined to vote against Lucas after hearing his
testimony.
   Lucas' defense of a series of Supreme Court decisions that civil
rights activists say will make it harder to win discrimination
suits prompted Conyers to return to the Judiciary Committee on
Thursday to withdraw his support.
   Runkel said the pressure on Conyers to change his position
``began in the hallway outside the hearing room'' after the
Michigan congressman had urged Lucas' confirmation on Wednesday.
   Conyers, who had introduced Lucas as someone ``deeply committed
to the vigorous enforcement of the civil rights laws, returned to
the committee Thursday and said he was ``frankly astounded'' by
Lucas' defense of the recent Supreme Court decisions.
   Lucas' views on the civil rights policy were well known to
Conyers, Runkel said, adding that nobody could expect an
administration nominee to depart from President Bush's policies.
   But a spokesman for Conyers, Michael Hill, said that Lucas, in
his discussions with Conyers in the months before the hearing,
``had never expressed to the congressmen that he thought those
decisions were sound.''
   ``A contention that Mr. Conyers was under intensive or enormous
pressure from the civil rights community following his testimony is
just not true,'' Hill said. ``That was a decision Mr. Conyers made
in the loneliness of his own conscience without any pressure from
anyone.''
   Lucas, echoing Thornburgh, had promised to closely monitor the
impact of the Supreme Court decisions on pending discrimination
cases and press for legislative changes if those rulings hurt the
cause of civil rights.
   The defection of Conyers has buoyed Lucas' opponents.
   ``I think the nomination is in serious trouble based on the
momentum of the last 48 hours,'' said Ralph G. Neas, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition
of groups opposing the nomination.

<HEAD>UMW Offers New Contract Proposal But Talks Recessed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUFFIELD, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Mine Workers presented a proposal
Friday to resolve its 3{-month-old strike against Pittston Coal
Group Inc., but no agreement was reached and the two sides decided
to recess.
   ``It appears there is nothing new in it,'' Pittston spokeswoman
Susan Copeland said Friday. The company will respond to the
proposal next week, she said.
   Each side said the other asked for a recess until Tuesday.
   ``It's really frustrating,'' said Bruce Bratten, administrative
assistant to UMW vice president Cecil Roberts. ``We came in here
and stated we were willing to stay and continue this on. It's hard
to come to an agreement when you can't get someone to sit at a
table across from you.''
   A four-person negotiating team from the union and Pittston vice
president Joe Farrell spent the day meeting in separate rooms and
federal mediators shuttled proposals back and forth. Negotiations
began about 10:30 a.m. and were recessed just after 3 p.m., Bratten
said.
   The union presented two proposals, Bratten said. One was a
formal request that the two sides meet face to face.
   The other proposal would address Pittston's need for miners to
work Sundays if Pittston would consider the miners' need for job
security, Bratten said. He refused to go into specifics.
   ``I don't know how long this is going to take,'' Bratten said.
``We're not that encouraged by their good faith and sincerity in
trying to resolve it.''
   The union also wants assurances from Pittston that if new mines
are opened, the jobs will go to some of the approximately 4,000
Pittston employees who have been laid off, he said.
   The UMW was disappointed that Paul Douglas, Pittston's chairman,
was not at Friday's negotiations, Bratten said. While UMW President
Richard Trumka was not in the meeting room, he was present at the
hotel, Bratten said.
   ``I don't think anyone expected anything to come out of this to
begin with,'' said Bo Givens, a UMW representative for District 28.
``Most of the guys you talk to say Pittston only went to the table
because of (U.S. District) Judge (Glen M.) Williams' order'' to
resume negotiations.
   In his letter last week to Trumka and Douglas, Williams
challenged the two sides to show up.
   Meantime, state police said Friday that a state trooper fired in
self-defense at a group of people throwing rocks. State police
spokesman Charles Vaughan said none of the alleged rock throwers
was hurt in Thurdsay's incident, that occurred while the cruiser
was following several coal trucks.
   Authorities said 42 people were charged with conspiracy to
commit a felony and were released on $5,000 bond Friday.
   By the time state trooper C.L. Helmer fired the shot, Trooper
D.W. Wyatt ``had already been hit a number of times and sustained a
number of cuts and bruises on his arm,'' Vaughan said. Firing a
shot is acceptable ``if you feel your life is in danger,'' Vaughan
said.
   Of the 42 people charged, 39 were from Ohio, two were from West
Virginia and one was from Virginia, Vaughan said. He did not know
whether they were striking miners, he said.
   The union has charged that Pittston hasn't bargained in good
faith and the company's proposals would undermine UMW members' job
security and hopes of future coal employment.

   Former President Carter will travel to
Ethiopia next week to serve as a mediator between the government
and Eritrean rebels, a U.S. diplomat said Friday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said Carter had been
accepted by both the Marxist government of Haile Mengistu Mariam
and by the Eritrean rebels who have been warring against the
government for 28 years in one of Africa's longest-running civil
wars.
   Cohen told reporters a dialogue between the two sides would make
it easier for the United States to improve relations with
Mengistu's government.
   Cohen said he himself would be traveling to Addis Ababa in the
near future to discuss improving relations, which have been
strained since the early 1908s, when Mengistu shifted his country's
alliances to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets have been pressing Mengistu to negotiate with the
rebels and end the costly war in an effort to cut Soviet aid to
Ethiopia. The Soviets have said that further military assistance
will not be forthcoming, Western diplomats have said.
   Soviet officials met in London last week with Eritrean leaders
to urge them to negotiate with Mengistu's government, Cohen said.
   Carter visited Ethiopia earlier this year and met with Mengistu.
In recent years, the former president has been a mediator and
observer in foreign conflicts, most recently heading a U.S.
delegation that observed the disputed elections in Panama.

<HEAD>Hatch Pressing Bill to Free Mother in Child Custody Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Keeping Elizabeth Morgan behind bars won't
persuade her to tell where her child is, a senator testified
Friday, arguing for legislation that would free the woman who has
been in jail nearly two years in a child custody case.
   Sen. Orin Hatch, R-Utah, is sponsoring a bill that would set a
12-month limit on civil contempt of court jailings in child custody
cases in the District of Columbia.
   The bill would apply retroactively to Morgan, a plastic surgeon
imprisoned by a judge without a trial in August 1987 after failing
to produce her daughter for court-ordered visits with the girl's
father.
   ``Dr. Morgan has now served almost two years in jail,'' Hatch
told a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee that has
jurisdiction over district matters. ``My answer to that is, `Enough
is enough.'''
   Morgan has alleged that Dr. Eric Foretich, her ex-husband and
the girl's father, had sexually abused seven-year-old Hilary.
Foretich has repeatedly denied that.
   The case has become a rallying point for women's rights and
anti-child abuse groups, while Foretich has received support from a
number of men's organizations.
   ``My bill takes no position on the merits of the Morgan case,
but I believe in child custody cases the contempt power can be
abused,'' Hatch told the committee's General Services, Federalism
and the District of Columbia panel. ``We're not talking about
hardened criminals here.''
   Hatch's bill is drawn more narrowly than a similar measure,
passed recently by the House, which applies to all civil contempt
jailings.
   In both cases, after a year, a prosecutor would either bring a
criminal contempt charge, requiring a trial, or the person would go
free.
   A spokesman for Rep. Frank Wolf, author of the House bill, said
Wolf was willing to compromise on certain issues, including
restricting the legislation to child custody cases.
   A D.C. Court of Appeals panel is reviewing Superior Court Judge
Herbert Dixon's most-recent decision to keep Morgan behind bars
until she divulges the whereabouts of her daughter.

<HEAD>Shanker: Only the Strong Schools Should Survive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public schools should be forced to compete in
a free market-type system, with losers closing down and winners
taking over their facilities, teachers union leader Albert Shanker
said Friday.
   Shanker, president of the 710,000-member American Federation of
Teachers, laid out his vision in a speech to 3,000 AFT members
attending a conference on education reform.
   He depicted a competitive model in which teachers play a large
role in running schools as the only alternative to a host of
options even less attractive to teachers _ among them tuition tax
credits and state and private takeovers of weak schools, such as
Boston University's oversight of the Chelsea, Mass., district.
   ``We do not have a choice of keeping what we have now,'' Shanker
said. ``We're either going to jump while we feel the water getting
warm or we're going to end up getting boiled.''
   Shanker proposed a high-stakes national education competition
with substantial financial rewards for schools and teachers that
make marked improvements and shutdowns of schools that can't do the
job.
   Integral to the plan would be incentives, flexibility,
accountability, federal assessments, parental freedom to choose
their child's school and a transfer of money from administrative to
instructional functions.
   Shanker suggested that President Bush invest $500 million for
five years to earn interest, then offer the money to teachers at
the schools that have made the most progress.
   ``The goal is to make each school a team, trying to bring about
the maximum possible improvement,'' Shanker said. He said winners
would include the same percentage of schools from every level of
achievement so weaker schools wouldn't have to compete against top
schools.
   Shanker also said Bush should create an assessment board to
determine whether students at a school could ``read a decent book,
write something worthwhile, solve a math problem or engage in
discussion of an important national issue.''
   Bush and Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos have been promoting
competition in education, saying it can be achieved by letting
parents choose their children's public schools. Cavazos has said
repeatedly that bad schools should close down if they can't do the
job.
   But neither has gone as far as Shanker, who on Friday compared
the current system to the Soviet Union's planned, top-down economy.
   Any competitive plan would have to be ratified by the local
union and board of education, Shanker said, and ``there's no point
in doing it if the same rules and regulations are in effect. You
have to set the schools free to do it their own way.''
   ``Ideally, this should also have losers,'' Shanker added, with
schools that fail shut down and turned over to more successful
schools.
   Shanker also proposed a national certificate for students who
want recognition for academic excellence, saying it would help
educators determine national guidelines for what students ought to
know in various subject areas.
   And he said he will urge employers to consider courses, grades,
attendance and teacher recommendations rather than a simple diploma
when they hire kids out of high school.
   ``We should have a system in which every student who is not
bound for college knows that his effort, habits of work and actual
accomplishments in school will mean the difference between being
the first or last to get the job and ... getting a job that pays
more and leads to something,'' Shanker said.
   Shanker predicted that if the administration does not entirely
embrace his competitive plan, there will be members of Congress,
private foundations, school districts, governors and businesses who
will pick up on it.
   ``I very strongly believe that in one form or another, in one
place or another, this is going to happen,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Bar on Exclusion of Ohio Palestinian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday upheld a
preliminary injunction that bars the government from excluding a
Palestinian man from the United States.
   Ruling in the case of Fouad Rafeedie of Cleveland, the appeals
court said that U.S. District Court Judge Joyce Green must decide
whether immigration procedures the U.S. government is using against
Rafeedie violate his right to due process under the Constitution.
   In its 2-1 ruling, the appeals panel said immigration officials
may proceed against Rafeedie under another provision of federal
law, which allows him to be represented by legal counsel, to
present evidence and to challenge witnesses in an open
administrative hearing.
   Rafeedie, a permanent resident alien who has lived outside
Cleveland for 13 years, traveled to Syria in 1986, attending the
meeting of an organization affiliated with the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, a terrorist group, immigration
officials say.
   Rafeedie, who denies he was affiliated with the group, was
questioned by the FBI on his return and in 1987 was charged with
being excludable from the United States under immigration laws.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service then attempted to
expel him under the summary exclusion provision of the
McCarran-Walter Act.
   Under that provision, the INS gave Rafeedie no indication of the
nature of confidential information on which it sought to exclude
him and Rafeedie isn't entitled to a hearing.
   Rafeedie's lawyer, David Cole of the Center for Constitutional
Rights, said he is confident the U.S. District Court will find that
the procedure violates due process.

<HEAD>U.S. Army Holds Evacuation Exercises In Panama</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FORT AMADOR, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army Friday conducted
exercises that included parking armored vehicles and deploying
troops in combat gear in front of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
office.
   U.S. officials said they were testing plans for evacuating
military units and Americans living in Panama. About 600 soldiers
were involved in the five-hour exercise at Fort Amador and Fort
Clayton, near Panama City at the southern entrance to the Panama
Canal.
   Noriega's government was not informed of the exercise
beforehand, and it was not known if he was in the office at the
time.
   The U.S. Southern Command said in a statement that the exercise,
called Purple Storm, was intended to demonstrate its ``commitment
to protect U.S. lives'' and ``resolve in enforcing U.S. Forces
treaty rights.''
   Under the 1977 treaties, the Panama Canal will be given to
Panama at the end of 1999, but U.S. forces will be in charge of the
canal's defense.
   The United States has troop movement rights, and U.S. officials
have said they would exercise them to pressure Noriega, Panama's de
facto leader, to step down as head of the nation's Defense Forces.
   On Thursday, the Organization of American States approved a
resolution calling for a transfer of power on Sept. 1 to restore
democracy and subsequent elections.
   The opposition, which appeared to have won the May 7
presidential election, criticized the resolution, saying it
effectively endorsed the government's annulment of the balloting.
   One of the drills at Fort Amador was carried out around
Noriega's office with U.S. helicopters hovering overhead. Armored
vehicles parked around the building, and U.S. troops in combat gear
were deployed.
   Fort Amador includes Panamanian military installations, a U.S.
naval station and a staff building. The naval station is across a
parking lot from Noriega's office; the staff building is across the
street.
   Detachments from seven army battalions and brigades took part,
including nearly 100 armored personnel carriers, mechanized landing
craft, and CH-47 and Cobra gunship helicopters. Two Navy patrol
boats and two Air Force jet aircraft provided additional security.
   Panamanians went about their business during the exercise. A
Panamanian military policeman tried to continue directing traffic,
even though he was hampered by two personnel carriers.
   Relations between the United States and Panama have been tense
since a federal grand jury in Florida indicted Noriega on drug
trafficking in Feburary 1988.
   The United States since has frozen millions of dollars worth of
Panamanian assets in U.S. banks and embargoed payments from Panama
Canal tolls. The measures have plunged the nation into an economic
crisis but have failed to budge Noriega.
   Noriega claims the attempts to oust him are part of an attempt
to violate the canal treaties so the United States can retain
control of the waterway.

<HEAD>Senate Amendment Eases Rules on Refugee Immigration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted to make it easier for Soviet
Jews and evangelical Christians, as well as Ukrainians and
Vietnamese, to enter the United States as refugees.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who authored the measure, said it
would relieve the backup of more than 4,000 Soviet refugees who
were stranded in Rome after they were denied entry to the United
States.
   The Senate passed the measure Thursday night as an amendment to
a State Department authorization bill.
   Lautenberg said the amendment would reduce the standard of proof
required of some foreigners seeking to enter the country on grounds
of persecution.
   At the direction of former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service last year began considering
each refugee application on a case-by-case basis. The INS revoked
old rules that had assumed applicants from certain countries were
persecuted.
   Under the Meese directive, the onus was on applicants to prove
they had a ``well grounded fear of persecution.'' But Meese did not
specify how this fear could be proven.
   Lautenberg's bill sets criteria to determine eligibility. Among
the criteria, the applicant may try to show he or she was denied
employment, entry into educational institutions or prohibited from
studying or practicing religion.
   ``It doesn't make sense to ignore the historic and continuing
pattern of persecution faced by most Soviet Jews, evangelical
Christians, Ukrainians and Vietnamese,'' Lautenberg said. ``The
very fact that someone belongs to one of these groups means that
they have a very real fear of persecution.
   ``The United States should continue to be a safe haven for those
who are persecuted by their governments for their race, religion or
political beliefs,'' he said.
   Lautenberg said a study by the congressional General Accounting
Office found that denial rates for Soviet Jews increased from 7
percent in 1988 to about 38 percent in March and 21 percent in June
under the changed policy.
   The New Jersey senator's amendment would establish a special
category for those refugees for 1989 and 1990 and would allow
reapplication for some of those denied admission since Aug. 15,
1988.
   According to Lautenberg aides, the Bush administration opposes
House legislation that restores the entitlement to apply based on
the presumption of persecution. However, it backs the Senate
compromise, fashioned with cooperation from the State Department,
aides said.

<HEAD>Higher Disability Income Limits Proposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, in a move to promote
self-sufficiency for the disabled, on Friday proposed increasing by
two-thirds the amount a person can earn and still receive federal
disability benefits.
   The change, proposed by the Department of Health and Human
Services, would take effect in January 1990.
   ``Federal programs should not perpetuate dependency,'' said a
statement issued by President Bush's press secretary, Marlin
Fitzwater.
   The change would ``provide an incentive for the 5.2 million
workers on the disability rolls to take significant steps toward
work and economic independence,'' Fitzwater said.
   The regulation would increase from $300 to $500 per month the
amount that could be earned by individuals receiving Social
Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
benefits and who are not blind.
   The allowed earnings level for blind beneficiaries is set by law
and is now $740 per month. This would not be changed by the
regulation.
   The proposed regulation also would change the trigger for the
``trial work period,'' during which a disability insurance
recipient continues to receive benefits after returning to work.
Currently, a recipient enters a ``trial work period'' when he earns
more than $75 per month or works more than 15 hours per week. That
would increase under the regulation to $200 or 40 hours.
   An SSI recipient's benefits are reduced by $1 for every $2 in
earnings over $65 per month. When the recipient's earnings reach
the current $300 per month ``substantial gainful activity'' level,
benefits can continue under certain circumstances. Under the
proposed regulation, benefits would continue at least until the
recipient's earnings reached $500 per month.
   The administration said the change would allow up to 71,000
people to retain or regain benefits under the two programs. The
cost in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, would be $60 million,
with the cost rising to $197 million in fiscal 1994.
   About 3 million blind and disabled workers receive SSI benefits.
The Disability Insurance program pays benefits to 2.83 million
workers and 1.24 million spouses and children of disabled workers.

<TEXT>
   National Organization for Women President
Molly Yard pledged Friday the group will launch a nationwide
campaign to gain support for a woman's right to have an abortion.
   NOW's membership has grown in recent weeks as women, angered by
the U.S. Supreme Court's July 3 ruling on abortion, join ranks in a
surge of activism, Ms. Yard said. Membership has grown from about
160,000 last year to its current 200,000.
   The Supreme Court ruled that states could restrict access to
abortions.
   ``People are angry,'' Ms. Yard said as NOW's three-day annual
conference began at the Cincinnati Convention Center. ``They are
angry that someone would come into their lives, into so personal a
decision as when, and if, to have children.''
   Outside the convention center, a dozen abortion opponents
picketed with signs showing remains of aborted fetuses. Pam Smith
of Cincinnati, one of the pickets, also carried her 4-month-old
son, Zachariah.
   Asked why she protested NOW's meeting, Ms. Smith said, ``Because
God gave us life in our womb. It's a blessing, and they're
murdering them.''
   Ms. Yard said NOW will work to elect politicians sympathetic to
its views, and will oppose lawmakers who don't.
   ``Have you watched politicians running for cover ever since July
3?'' she said. ``We intend, on the national and state level, to
fight those who would deny women the freedom to control their
reproductive lives and who would deny us equal rights under the
Constitution. ... That is the message of the women's movement.''
   NOW lawyers are working on a proposal, which could take the form
of a bill or constitutional amendment, that would prohibit states
from interfering with women's rights to have abortions, Ms. Yard
said. The organization hopes to have the proposal introduced in
Congress in September.
   Ms. Yard said NOW will work against President Bush because the
group regards him as being an opponent of women's rights.
   ``His position denying women the right to control their
reproductive lives will be the main issue of his re-election
campaign if he chooses to run in 1992,'' Ms. Yard said. ``We will
make this the issue of the 1990s.''
   In Washington, a White House spokeswoman declined to respond to
Ms. Yard's comments.
   NOW leaders expect about 1,000 to attend the conference, which
offers workshops on issues including sexual harassment and legal
rights, lesbian rights task forces, feminist spirituality, the
Equal Rights Amendment, the homeless and eating disorders.
   Members planned a march and rally for women's rights Saturday.

<TEXT>
   Ernest Hemingway once called his hometown
a place of ``broad lawns and narrow minds,'' but residents still
turned out Friday on the writer's 90th birthday for a ceremony
unveiling a new stamp in his honor.
   About 200 people gathered at the U.S. Post Office to watch color
guards whirl flags and to hear speeches as the stamp was unveiled.
   The stamp made its debut earlier in the week in Key West, Fla.,
where the novelist spent a significant portion of his life.
   Born in Oak Park in 1899, Hemingway lived in the western Chicago
suburb until he was 18. He committed suicide in 1961 at the age of
61.
   ``I've been sitting here wondering if Ernest was alive, if he
would be here today,'' said A.E. Hotchner, author of ``Papa
Hemingway'' and one of Hemingway's close friends.
   ``Yes, I think he would be here, for all that's been said about
his feelings for Oak Park,'' Hotchner said. ``It is deeply
ingrained in him. He would have made a lousy speech, but he would
have been moved.''
   The rumor that Hemingway hated his hometown is a myth, said
Scott Schwar, chairman of the Ernest Hemingway Foundation.
   ``The inner real Hemingway was shaped in Oak Park,'' Schwar said
in a telephone interview.
   In the new stamp, a bearded Hemingway standing in front of
antelopes in Africa stares out of giant posters. He is the seventh
in the literary arts series of stamps that also has featured John
Steinbeck, William Faulkner and T.S. Eliot.
   Hemingway's son, Patrick, friends and community leaders received
special books of stamps. Some 160 million Hemingway stamps were
sent this week to post offices across the country, said Jerry Lee,
regional postmaster general.
   Hemingway's early writing can be found in an Oak Park High
School literary magazine, the Tabula. He imitated famous writers of
his time, such as Ring Lardner, Hotchner said.
   ``I remember in high school Ernest took me to the third floor of
his house,'' said 91-year-old Lewis Clarahan, Hemingway's longtime
friend. ``He pulled out a sheet from his typewriter and showed me a
story he wrote. I think it was his first.''
   ``I don't remember if it was good, but Ernest sure thought it
was,'' he said, laughing.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black priest suspended by the Roman Catholic
Church for starting a breakaway black congregation said Friday that
a major church-run university has discriminated against blacks.
   The Rev. George A. Stallings Jr. said in a statement that there
are only 20 blacks enrolling as freshmen at Washington's Catholic
University of America next fall. In all, about 1,000 students are
expected to begin studies there.
   Stallings also criticized the university for the ``meager
representation'' of 10 blacks among its faculty of about 350 and
said it lacked courses on black literature, music or religion.
   ``Such facts not only demonstrate a record of blatant exclusion;
they are a clear example of intellectual dishonesty of the most
decided kind,'' Stallings said.
   The university is under the aegis of the Archdiocese of
Washington.
   Stallings, 41, was suspended by the archdiocese after he said
Mass in defiance of Cardinal James A. Hickey on July 2.
   Stallings has said the Catholic Church has failed its nearly two
million black parishioners and has charged the church with racism.
   Catholic University said it is an equal opportunity employer and
has established special scholarships for minority students.
   ``We are making serious efforts to recruit black faculty members
and students but, as everyone knows, applicants with appropriate
credentials are limited and in great demand by all institutions,''
the university's public affairs office said in a statement.
   The university did not dispute Stallings' figures for black
students or faculty members.
   Stallings' statement was part of a letter he sent Friday to
Bishop John Ricard of Baltimore. Ricard was one of the signers of a
call for unity issued by the nation's 13 black bishops a week ago.
   The black bishops' statement said in part, ``We sincerely hope
(Stallings' followers) are not commingling personal dissapointment,
individually felt frustrations and personal anger under the banner
of racism. Racism is a sin which the church must address. It is too
serious an issue to be used as a cover for selfish concerns.''
   Stallings responded:
   ``The glaring fact that you seem to ignore is that what
disappointment or discouragement we feel is due to the reality of
racism; and, even more importantly, is the result of the church's
apparent inability or unwillingness to take radical steps to
transform an otherwise racist institution into a church that is
truly inclusive and universal.''
   Stallings maintained that his four-week-old Imani Temple is not
separate from the Catholic church.
   ``I did not depart from the church nor its mission or mandates;
rather, the church abandoned its zeal and energies in the pursuit
of justice and the transformation of our society,'' Stallings wrote.
   Ricard was out of town and had not seen Stallings' letter, a
spokeswoman for Ricard said.

   Somalia's armed forces rounded up
thousands of people and summarily executed 46 men following Moslem
rioting that left 400 dead, a human rights group and independent
sources said Friday.
   The government said the reports were sensational propaganda and
lies.
   The human rights group Africa Watch and other sources said the
violence occurred July 14 in Mogadishu, the capital of the East
African nation, following the slaying of a Roman Catholic bishop
and the arrests of Moslem religious leaders.
   Africa Watch and the sources put the number killed during the
rioting at about 400 after soldiers opened fire on houses in
residential districts.
   More than 1,000 people were injured, but many were afraid to go
to the hospital for fear of arrest, said the human rights group in
a statement released in Nairobi. The group has offices in
Washington and London.
   Throughout the evening of the riots and the following night,
witnesses said soldiers went from house to house arresting men,
raping women and looting. Africa Watch said about 2,000 people were
arrested during the searches.
   Forty-six people arrested two days after the riots were accused
in military courts of having participated in the violence, found
guilty and taken to a beach outside Mogadishu where they were shot
to death, said Africa Watch.
   The government has said 23 people died and 59 were injured in
violence it blamed on ``troublemakers.''
   In Washington, the State Department said it was concerned about
what it termed ``credible reports'' of executions in Somalia.
   ``We are very disturbed by these reports,'' said spokesman
Richard Boucher. ``We are directing our embassy in Mogadishu to
raise our concern with the Somali government and ask it to act to
ensure that civil liberties and human rights are fully protected.''
   In September, the human rights group Amnesty International said
the government of autocratic President Mohamed Siad Barre executed
up to 1,000 civilians while trying to end an insurgency in the
north. In response, the U.S. Congress froze $55 million in aid to
the impoverished nation.
   The government has forbidden journalists from visiting Somalia
since heavy fighting broke out between government forces and the
northern rebel Somali National Movement in 1988. Telecommunications
with the country are difficult.
   The Somali Embassy in Washington relayed a statement issued by
the Foreign Ministry in Mogadishu that said:
   ``After last week's events in Mogadishu, enemies of the Somali
people and their collaborators have been disseminating sensational
propaganda, lies about the true situation in Somalia. The sources
of such malicious disinformation are terrorist groups whose
ultinmate motive is to spread chaos throughout the country.
   ``The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Somali Democratic
Republic wishes to state categorically that the situation in
Mogadishu is normal and (in) the country as a whole.''
   Independent sources, who would not be identified for fear of
government reprisals, corroborated much of the human rights group's
report, including the executions.
   The July 14 violence broke out after the arrests the previous
day of four Moslem leaders and an unspecified number of civilians,
according to the sources and Africa Watch.
   Armed detachments surrounded Mogadishu's mosques in anticipation
of protests and used physical and verbal abuse to disperse
worshipers as they left, the sources and Africa Watch said.
   Soldiers then opened fire on the worshipers who fought back
primarily with rocks and stones. In at least one neighborhood of
western Mogadishu, worshipers outnumbered security forces, seized
their weapons and returned fire, according to Africa Watch.
   The army moved into the city with tanks and took over all major
government buildings and crossroads and closed all roads from
Mogadishu, according to Africa Watch.
   In addition to the arrests of the Moslem leaders, the violence
appeared linked to the July 9 slaying of Mogadishu's Roman Catholic
Bishop Salvatore Colombo, an Italian who had lived in Somalia for
more than 40 years, according to Africa Watch.
   The government said Colombo was shot by a lone gunman. Africa
Watch said there was widespread suspicion in Mogadishu that Colombo
was killed by government forces who suspected him of passing
information about human rights abuses to foreign governments.
   Moslem leaders are said to have been angry that the government
offered a $13,000 reward for information about Colombo's slaying
but showed little concern for the welfare of its own people, said
Africa Watch.
   Some residents, who reported a recent upsurge in anti-Christian
and anti-white feeling in the capital, said Colombo was suspected
of trying to convert Moslem youth.
   Scattered incidents of gunfire were reported in Mogadishu since
the riots. A dusk-to-dawn curfew ordered after the clashes was
eased Thursday to 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.
   Somalia is populated by an estimated 6 million members of the
Somali tribe, which is composed of about half a dozen clans.
   Islam is the state religion in the impoverished pastoral nation,
which is on the Horn of Africa and juts into the Indian Ocean to
the south and the Gulf of Aden to the north. There are about 2,000
Roman Catholics in the nation.
   Barre has ruled Somalia as a one-party state since 1969. The
country was once allied with the Soviet Union but switched
allegiance to the West in 1977.

   A Pan Am jet carrying a flight crew but no
passengers diverted to Heathrow Airport on Friday night after the
pilot detected a fault in one of the hydraulic systems, the airline
reported.
   The Boeing 727 was traveling from Frankfurt, West Germany, to
New York via Keflavik, Iceland, on a routine flight to transport
the aircraft, said Alan Loflin, a Pan Am spokesman in New York.
   He said the pilot reported the fault over the Atlantic and
returned to London for repairs.
   Loflin said the aircraft had two other hydraulic systems that
could be used to control it, and even if they had failed it could
have been steered manually. The incident was ``nothing close to an
emergency,'' he said.
   Fire engines and emergency services lined Heathrow's main runway
as the jet touched down, but Loflin said emergency service had not
been requested.
   A United Airlines DC-10 lost its tail engine, then its hydraulic
system, and crashed Wednesday at Sioux City, Iowa, while trying to
make an emergency landing. At least 109 people were killed and 184
survived, officials said.

   The Food and Drug Administration on Friday
warned hospitals nationwide against using a nutritional powder that
contains a potentially fatal amount of potassium.
   The product is called Nutrex Aminex and is made by the Nutrex
Corp. of Sunnyvale, Calif. The powder is mixed with water and
administered by mouth or by gastric tube to patients who can't eat
ordinary meals.
   The FDA took the action after a report of a patient at the
Veterans Administration Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn.,
developed heart arrhythmias and was found to have high blood
potassium. The patient recovered when taken off Aminex.
   The agency said FDA and VA tests later showed the Aminex powder
contained high amounts of potassium. Too much of the nutrient can
be fatal.
   The FDA said it has not been able to obtain a list of
institutions that bought the product. The agency issued a general
warning in an effort to reach all hospitals.
   It said the packets of powder are unflavored or flavored
strawberry, vanilla or orange. They are labeled: ``Nutritionally
complete elemental diet for oral or tube feeding _ Nutrex Aminex
Nutritional Powder.''

   Showers and thunderstorms in the southeastern United States on
Friday hit in clusters from northwest Florida to the southern
Appalachians and flash flooding continued.
   Officials using dogs and a state police helicopter searched
along a northern Virginia creek for signs of a car, carrying as
many as three people, that washed off a bridge in a flash flood.
   At least 10 cars were swept off the bridge shortly after
midnight Thursday when Goose Creek rose an estimated 13 feet in 30
minutes. One woman was drowned and three people were rescued by
boat from the tops of their vehicles.
   Flash flood warnings were posted Friday in Nevada and North
Carolina.
   Showers and thunderstorms were also over coastal sections of the
Carolinas, southern Illinois, eastern sections of the middle
Mississippi Valley, western sections of the lower Ohio Valley, West
Texas and along a cold front crossing the northern high Plains.
   It was fair across most of the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies over much of the central third of the nation and in the
Pacific Northwest.
   Strong southerly winds boosted temperatures into the lower 90s
in the northern Plains region. Brisk northerly winds accompanied
clouds and drizzle over parts of the middle Mississippi Valley and
kept afternoon readings in the 60s.
   Temperatures in western parts of the nation varied from the 60s
in the Pacific Northwest to 100 degrees or above in the
southwestern deserts.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Fort Ord near Monterey, Calif., to 104 degrees at Palm
Springs, Calif.
   The nation's low Friday morning was 39 degrees at Houlton, Maine.
   Saturday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the Atlantic Coast states to the southern half
of the Great Plains region and over the Rocky Mountain and Plateau
region. Showers and thunderstorms were expected to be most numerous
in the lower Missouri Valley, in northern Arizona and from southern
Mississippi and southeastern Louisiana to Florida and southern
Georgia. Sunny skies were expected across most of the rest of the
nation.
   Temperatures were expected to reach 90 degrees from northern
Florida to eastern Virginia and the Delmarva Peninsula.
Temperatures were expected above 90 from the northern Plains to the
Great Basin and central Plateau and from south central Texas to the
southwestern deserts. Readings above 100 degrees were predicted for
southern Arizona, southern Nevada and southern and central
California. High temperatures were expected in the 70s along the
Pacific Coast.

<TEXT>
   The city will hire 350 specialists to teach
handicapped students in a plan that settles a four-year dispute
between the school board and the U.S. Department of Education, it
was announced Friday.
   ``This settlement brings to an end what can only be described as
the shameful and disgraceful mistreatment of those children who are
most vulnerable and in need of special care,'' James W. Compton,
president of the Chicago Board of Education, said at a news
conference where he was surrounded by 20 handicapped students.
   The plan calls for the board to shift money and employees from
central and district offices to local schools, said Compton, who
was appointed in a school board shake-up when Mayor Richard M.
Daley took office. The plan also creates a new post, interim
associate superintendent, to oversee the services to handicapped
students.
   In the course of the dispute, the school board was threatened
with the loss of more than $100 million in annual federal aid and
$4 million in funds for magnet-schools, which have smaller, more
intensive classes.
   The school board allocated $4.4 million of its $365.9 million
special-education budget for the settlement, officials said.
   Donald Moore, executive director of Designs for Change, a
Chicago child-advocacy organization, called the plan one of the
most significant settlements of its kind in a decade.
   ``We think it is excellent,'' he said. ``It is cutting a lot of
central office positions and putting that money in the local
schools where it is needed.''
   The dispute arose in 1984, when the federal agency investigated
the delivery of services to handicapped students by the Chicago
Public Schools.
   The 15-month probe found that the school system, by failing to
evaluate and place handicapped children promptly, was in violation
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
   The law requires that students believed to have mental,
emotional or physical disabilities be tested and evaluated within
60 days and, if warranted, placed in special-education programs.
   About 3,500 Chicago students have not been not evaluated _ a
backlog dating to 1983, school officials said Friday. There are
about 41,000 handicapped students in the system, which has about
410,000 students.
   Last August, an administrative law judge upheld the government's
finding and ordered that federal money be withheld from Chicago
schools if the system was not brought into compliance.
   Moore said the dispute hurt a number of handicapped students.
   He said hundreds of parents of handicapped students have come to
his agency seeking help for children who had not received proper
placement.
   ``When the handicapped child is sitting in a regular classroom
and not receiving proper care, they tend to deteriorate,'' he said.
   Plans call for the hiring of additional teachers, psychologists,
social workers and counselors.
   Compton said the school system's special education structure
would be completely reorganized by the start of the fall semester.

   A veteran U.S. diplomat is being investigated
as a possible Soviet spy after reportedly being videotaped passing
a briefcase to a Soviet agent, the State Department confirmed
Friday night.
   The briefcase transfer was recorded in Vienna, where the
official in question, Felix S. Bloch, first had contact with the
Soviets three years ago, ABC News reported.
   There was no answer at Bloch's Washington home Friday night.
John McWethy, the ABC reporter on the story, said Bloch declined to
comment when reached earlier.
   Bloch, a 30-year-career employee, has been placed on leave, his
building pass withdrawn and his security clearance revoked, the
department said in a statement.
   Officials weren't immediately sure, but it could be the first
time a U.S. diplomat has been involved in an espionage case since
the famous Hiss case of the late 1940s. There have been other cases
involving military personnel attached to embassies.
   Bloch was director of the office of regional political-economic
affairs in the department's Bureau of European and Canadian
Affairs. In that position, he would have been involved in almost
anything that dealt with two or more European countries, including
the Soviet Union.
   In Vienna, he had been deputy chief of mission, the No. 2
official in the embassy, and would have had access to all the
embassy's activities and communications.
   Vienna has been the site of the long-running and largely
unfruitful talks on conventional arms reduction in Europe, the
Mutual Balanced Force Reduction talks between the NATO alliance and
the Warsaw Pact.
   Bloch returned from Vienna about two months ago, when he was
``picked up'' by FBI agents, ABC said.
   A department source who knows Bloch and who spoke on condition
of anonymity said he believed that was a reference to Bloch
returning from a trip to Vienna. Bloch had completed his Vienna
assignment and returned to work in Washingt about a year ago, this
source said.
   But Bloch has not been charged with anything. The network showed
pictures of men in cars at his home who, it said, were FBI agents
keeping him under 24-hour surveillance.
   Soviet agents also have been watching Bloch, ABC said.
   Bloch was not home. His apartment is across the hall in an
elegant 32-unit building from the former home of Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
   No surveillance cars were in evidence Friday night, but a
neighbor, Preston Pitts, said the cars had been around for at least
three weeks.
   ``They were everywhere, like ants,'' said Pitts.
   Pitts said Bloch told him three or four months ago he was in
line for a nomination as ambassador to a South American country.
When the surveillance teams showed up, Pitts said, he asked Bloch
if they were bodyguards and if he were in danger, but Bloch said no.
   Neither Bloch, his wife Lou nor a daughter in her 20s had been
seen since Thursday, Pitts said.
   Bloch, a native of Austria, turned 54 on Wednesday. He holds a
bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a
master's degree from the University of California at Berkeley.
   The last public edition of the department's biographical
register, published in 1974, said Bloch had served in Berlin,
Dusseldorf, West Germany and in Caracas, Venezuela.
   The department source who knows Bloch said he served as economic
counselor at the U.S. embassy in East Berlin in 1974-1975, and
later in Singapore.
   A colleague in Bloch's office refused to discuss him when
reached Friday night.
   In a statement read by spokeswoman Anita Stockman, the State
Department said it was ``pursuing the inquiry thoroughly in order
to identify the compromised security which has occurred and the
appropriate legal steps.''
   Ms. Stockman said it was premature to speculate on what secrets
might have been compromised.
   The network said State Department investigators believed Bloch
had not been motivated by money, and were speculating that he was
dismayed that after 30 years he had not reached the rank of
ambassador.
   Alger Hiss, who had been a high department official, secretary
of the founding conference of the United Nations and adviser to
President Roosevelt at the World War II Yalta conference with
Britain and the Soviet Union, was publicly accused of espionage in
1948 by writer Whittaker Chambers.
   Chambers said Hiss passed him secret documents to pass on to
Soviet spies.
   A celebrated congressional investigation into the case propelled
a young congressman in charge, Richard Nixon, into the national
spotlight.
   Hiss denied everything, but was convicted of perjury and served
a prison sentence.

<HEAD>Blaize Breaks With Governing Party, Creates Own Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Herbert Blaize on
Friday said he was starting his own political party, confronting
the Caribbean island nation with its worst political crisis since
the 1983 U.S.-led invasion.
   In a half-hour speech broadcast by state radio and television,
Blaize said he broke with the governing New National Party that put
him in power and announced the formation of his own National Party
to ``continue to sail the ship of state along the road of
progress.''
   Blaize touched off a crisis Thursday by firing James Mitchell,
political leader of the New National Party, from his post as Works
and Communications minister.
   The two leaders had been at odds since a party convention in
January when delegates ousted the ailing Blaize, 71, as the party's
political leader and elected Mitchell to replace him.
   ``The prime minister never acceped being beaten at the
convention. So I have been dismissed for that action,'' Mitchell
said Friday.
   Mitchell said he was fired also because he refused to dismiss
from the party two executive members who had been supporters of the
Marxist People's Revolutionary Government, which came to power in
1979 and was ousted by the U.S.-led invasion in October 1983.
   Blaize has strongly opposed Mitchell's campaign since January to
enlist Grenadians, including members of the former Marxist
government, into a broad coalition called the ``new thrust.''
   Blaize said in his speech that with Mitchell's ``new thrust''
campaign, ``we are likely to orbit once more in the 1979-1983
period'' of instability.
   ``We refuse to be part of it,'' he said.
   Marxist Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was killed by hard-line
members of his government, provoking the invasion.
   Mitchell said his ouster as Works and Communications minister
has created an ``atmosphere of terror'' among government workers
fearing for their jobs.
   ``It makes me wonder whether this is not a deliberate set-up to
put in train a process for instability and possible violence in the
country, and at the same time claim that other people are doing
it,'' Mitchell said.
   The developments have caused confusion and consternation in this
island of 100,000.
   Blaize had a 9-6 majority in Parliament. His dispute with
Mitchell left him with eight seats.
   Parliament majority members are Cabinet ministers, so they are
bound more to the prime minister than to the governing party. The
remaining eight members likely would rally to Blaize's new party.
   Mitchell said he favored calling elections immediately.
Elections are due by December.
   ``The country under the present circumstances is not in
health,'' he said.
   As the governing party's political leader, Mitchell would become
prime minister if the party wins the elections.
   Blaize was elected to office in 1984.

<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi of Libya and President
Hissene Habre of Chad, who have been enemies for years, met to
settle their border dispute Friday, but the talks broke off without
an agreement.
   The presidents of four other African nations who had been
mediating the talks left the meeting without comment.
   Gadhafi and Habri also declined to comment to reporters who had
been waiting in a room decorated with banners honoring the expected
``Bamako Declaration.''
   It was not immediately known whether more talks would take place.
   The negotiations began on Thursday and marked the first meeting
between Gadhafi and Habre in seven years.
   Officials of two of the observer nations initially told
reporters Friday that the signing of the agreement was assured. By
late evening, however, when the talks continued beyong schedule, it
became clear obstacles had developed.
   The sources said Habre objected to several points in the
proposed agreement, including a section calling for immediate
return of war prisoners. He also demanded a change of language to
remove any ambiguity about plans for the International Court of
Justice to settle the question of the Aouzou border region, the
sources said.
   Habre was under pressure to accept the agreement without
changes, one official said, because ``it may be difficult to get
Gadhafi to return to a meeting like this again.'' The official's
delegation is generally favorable to Chad's position in the
conflict.
   Gadhafi, Habre and the presidents of Gabon, Algeria and Mali
went into a small room Friday afternoon, tightly guarded by
soldiers. Gen. Ibraham Babangida, the Nigerian president, joined
them later.
   Under the proposed agreement, as drafted by officials of Mali
and Algeria, Chad and Libya would try to settle the Aouzou border
issue by political means, meaning negotiations within the
Organization of African Unity, and take it to the International
Court of Justice if those attempts failed.
   It also calls for a treaty of friendship, a pledge by each not
to attack the other and creation of an OAU observer force to
stabilize a year-old truce.
   All prisoners would be repatriated. Chad is said to hold at
least 2,000 Libyans, but Libya says it has returned all captured
Chadians.
   Habre has consistently refused to return the prisoners until the
signing of a peace treaty.
   He and Gadhafi met and shook hands Thursday night, then held a
three-hour meeting that ended at about 1 a.m. Friday.
   Before talks resumed Friday afternoon, Gadhafi and presidents
Omar Bongo of Gabon, Moussa Traore of Mali and Chadli Bendjedid of
Algeria attended prayers at Bamako's main mosque. Gadhafi, waving
clenched fists, plunged into a crowd of young people who were
screaming his name.
   Since Gadhafi gained power in 1969, he has supported several
anti-government groups in Chad, Libya's southern neighbor. They
included Habre's own faction when he was a guerrilla leader.
   After a Libyan invasion, government troops and allied French
soldiers drove Libyan forces out in 1987. France, the colonial
power until independence in 1960, has about 1,500 soldiers in Chad
to support Habre.
   Libya has kept its foothold in the Aouzou Strip. The
45,600-square-mile border area, thought to be rich in uranium, has
been in dispute for decades.
   Last month, Habre accused Libya of preparing an attack from
Sudan, Chad's eastern neighbor, with Chadian dissidents. Sudan and
Libya denied the charges.

   President Bush formally proposed
anti-pollution legislation Friday to ``make clean air the
birthright of every American.'' Critics complained that Bush was
not living up his vow to be the environmental president.
   Officially signing off on the bill in a Rose Garden ceremony,
Bush said that, if approved, ``this piece of legislation will see
to it that every American in every city in America will breathe
clean air.
   ``It will stop the degredation that's been caused by acid rain
by the end of this century and it will cut airborne toxic chemicals
from major sources by at least 75 percent.''
   The bill, if approved by Congress, would:
   _Require reductions in emissions that cause acid rain.
   _Set deadlines for cities to comply with ozone-reduction
standards through such measures as the use of alternative fuels.
   _Tighten tailpipe emission standards for cars.
   _Create a regulatory system to crack down on industrial sources
of airborne toxic chemicals.
   But environmental activists, congressional critics and even a
sponsor of the president's own package said it was not enough.
Critics contended that in some areas the proposal would actually
weaken existing laws.
   Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Environment Committee and the legislator who will sponsor
the Senate version of Bush's bill, told reporters, ``We don't agree
with all of it.''
   Chafee said he will push to tighten auto emission standards in
the bill and would be astounded if a clean air bill could pass by
year's end.
   But, as environmental groups and members of Congress rushed to
criticize various sections of the package, Chafee also said such
comments were unjustified.
   ``Sure, it doesn't do everything they want, but who in this town
gets everything they want?'' he asked.
   For their part, the Big Three auto companies all said they
thought it would be difficult to meet the requirements of the Bush
proposal. A Ford Motor Co. statement, for example, said: ``We
believe the president's bill takes the nation in the right
direction and we support his vision. But meeting the specific
provisions will stretch our technical capabilities to the limits.''
   William Fay, head of the Clean Air Working Group, a utility
organization, said, ``Assertions by some that this is a weak bill
are simply ludicrous.''
   Fay said the acid rain provisions would not only require
utilities to reduce emissions from their current generating output,
but would force them into even costlier controls if they sought to
increase capacity, and the alternative auto fuel proposals amounted
to ``a disincentive to make gasoline burn cleaner.''
   In light of the attacks, Bush told the Rose Garden gathering
that ``clean air is too important to be a partisan issue.''
   He said he had worked to balance a range of concerns _
``economic growth, job creation, environemntal protection,
mobility, unfettered commerce.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chief Senate sponsor of separate
clean-air legislation, said the language of Bush's bill ``will
significantly tarnish his image to be the environmental president.''
   ``The president stepped up to the problem, blinked and stepped
back,'' Baucus said, contending that the president's bill would
actually increase motor vehicle emissions, allow cities too much
time to clean their air and give too much weight to cost in toxic
chemical cleanup.
   Critics claimed Bush conceded too much to industry.
   They complained that instead of setting rigid standards, the
bill would give the EPA excessive discretion on emission standards
for cars, trucks and buses, and create too much flexibility for the
EPA administrator, local governments and industry in taking
measures to reduce ozone pollution, acid rain and airborne toxic
chemicals.
   In addition, the legislation would allow the EPA to consider
industry's economic costs in making key decisions.
   Chafee and others said they were concerned about a provision to
allow automakers to meet the tailpipe emission standards for
hydrocarbons by using a fleet average, rather than requiring each
model to meet the standard.
   ``Quite frankly, we're hearing from local officials ... who say
they just won't be able to succeed in cleaning up their cities
unless some changes are made in the bill,'' to further tighten
emission standards, said Joe Goffman, senior attorney for the
Environmental Defense Fund.
   Using the fleet-average method ``would allow half of the cars to
exceed pollution limits, so long as the standards are met on the
average'' for a manufacturer, predicted Rep. Henry A. Waxman,
D-Calif. ``It's a shell game.''
   The EPA denied the auto emission section would allow more
pollution, but Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said that part of
the bill ``looks like a relief package for Detroit and Tokyo.''

   Passengers may shun flying United Airlines
briefly, but investors are likely to stay aboard the nation's
second-largest airline, accepting accidents as a hazard of the
industry, analysts say.
   The deadly crash of United Flight 232 in an Iowa cornfield
Wednesday followed an 18-month period of aggressive recovery by
United, moving boldly to recover its long-held ranking as the
industry leader.
   The DC-10 disaster will likely have little impact on the
resurgence of UAL Corp., United's parent, analysts said.
   ``Usually for a short period of time there is customer avoidance
of a carrier that has had an incident,'' said Robert J. Joedicke,
an industry analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
``This tends to wear off fairly promptly,'' he said.
   And United shareholders will be ``more concerned with the
tragedy of the crash than about the price of their stock,'' said
analyst Robert Decker of Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. ``Investors
realize that a crash is part of the business risk of an airline.''
   UAL stock closed down $1.25 at $170.75 in New York Stock
Exchange trading Friday. The stock lost $1.50 on Thursday.
   One day before the accident, United Chairman Stephen Wolf
announced the airline was seeking federal approval for several
trans-Atlantic routes in a bid to make the carrier, with its
extensive Pacific coverage, ``a truly global airline.''
   That move, and Wolf's announcement in April that the airline was
placing a $15.4 billion order with Boeing for new planes, marked
the success of the simple battle plan he outlined when he came
aboard the troubled carrier in December 1987: Quality service would
lead to improved earnings, which would allow the airline to expand
its fleet and operations.
   The past five years brought to United's parent company a name
change that was quickly revoked, an identity crisis and a bitter,
month-long walkout by the airline's pilots and flight attendants.
   But the hectic period in United's 62-year history ended with the
company under new leadership and proudly opening its home-base
terminal at O'Hare International Airport _ a frosted
glass-and-steel showcase.
   The price of UAL stock has climbed in recent weeks, along with
that of other airlines after the announced takeover of Northwest
Airlines' parent NWA Inc. by an international investors' group.
   Analysts say United's 80 percent ownership of its 408-plane
fleet _ the highest rate among major carriers, many of whom lease
their planes _ enhances its investment appeal.
   Wolf's announcement that United had placed orders and options
for as many as 370 planes is central to the airline's bid to
reclaim its rank as the nation's largest domestic carrier, a title
recently assumed by American Airlines, said United spokeswoman Sue
Moss.
   Wolf also announced first-quarter revenues rose almost 12
percent to $2.3 billion and profits from continuing operations more
than doubled to $65.4 million _ ``our fifth consecutive quarter of
superb earnings and the best first-quarter of United's history.''
   In contrast, for 10 lean years starting in 1977, Chicago-based
UAL reported profits just four times and increased its fleet only
slightly.
   ``They certainly have done an excellent turnaround,'' Joedicke
said. ``They're moving in a positive direction under the management
of Mr. Wolf. ... in the year and a half he's been there he's
achieved great strides.''
   Wolf was brought in after UAL's brief, ill-fated run as Allegis
Corp.
   The name change came in February 1987, during the tenure of
former chairman Richard Ferris, who envisioned a travel services
conglomerate combining air travel, car rental, hotels and a
reservations system. But big losses produced pressure for change
from major shareholders.
   Ferris resigned four months after the name change, and new
management moved quickly to restore the UAL name and dump the
non-airline businesses.
   Before Ferris departed, his expansion plans prompted a $4.1
billion bid for United from the union representing its pilots.
   The offer still stands, though United's pilots are ``pleased
that the airline is independent once again,'' said Hank Krakowski
of the Air Line Pilots Association.
   United was the target of a bitter 29-day walkout by the pilots
and the Association of Flight Attendants in 1985. The carrier won
the day, imposing two-tier contracts with lower pay scales for new
hires.
   The provision is the key obstacle in United's on-again,
off-again talks with the flight attendants, whose contract expired
in 1987, and is a major issue for the pilots, whose pact expired
last year.

<HEAD>Four Officials Told They'll Be Dismissed</HEAD>

   Three officials of the Housing and Urban
Development Department's troubled Washington field office were told
Friday they will fired in 30 days and a fourth will be told next
Tuesday, HUD officials disclosed.
   These are the first people dismissed as part of the department's
investigation of mismanagement and cronyism during the Reagan
administration.
   The Washington field office was the base of operations of escrow
agent Marilyn Harrell, who became known as ``Robin HUD'' after she
confessed to diverting $5.5 million of the department's money to
charities.
   The four officials were placed on leave in June, then given
temporary assignments at headquarters when their leaves expired
earlier this month.
   They are Margaret White, former head of the office; Robert B.
Warner, director of housing management; Charles W. Womble, loan
specialist; and Everett Rothschild, head of property disposition.
   An audit of the office found that lax financial and management
controls allowed agents like Ms. Harrell to delay transfers of
funds or not make them at all. Auditors have estimated the office
is missin a total of $10 million.
   The officials, who made known the dismissal notices on condition
they not be identified, said all but Rothschild were given letters
informing them they will be dismissed in 30 days unless they can
refute charges of mismanagement against them.
   Rothschild is out of town and will be given his letter on
Tuesday, the officials said.
   Ms. White had wide support among Washington politicians and many
protested when she was placed on leave. The District Urban League
also wrote Kemp a protest letter.
   In a speech Friday to agency workers at the swearing in of HUD's
new general counsel, Francis Keating, Secretary Jack Kemp repeated
his pledge to root out fraud and mismanagement.
   Kemp told the workers he would have ``zero tolerance'' for
mismanagement and said any employees who felt they could not live
up to higher standards should quit.
   Still pending is a decision on the fate of the head of HUD's New
York regional office, Geraldine McGann, who is on leave pending an
investigation of her performance.
   The Commerce Department last week also said R. Hunter Cushing, a
former ranking HUD official, had taken a leave pending the outcome
of the various investigations of HUD.

   A television news director whose station had
footage of United Airlines' fiery crash in Sioux City, Iowa, said
Friday he will take action against stations that didn't get
permission to use the videotape.
   ``For those who didn't ask, they are going to get billed
substantially more than those who did,'' said Van Carter, news
director at KTIV-TV. ``If they don't want to pay it, then yes, we
may wind up with legal action.''
   In Sioux City, rescue officials on Friday said they had
recovered 109 bodies after Wednesday's crash. More than 180 people
survived the crash.
   KTIV, an NBC affiliate, intended the exclusive footage of the
tumbling, burning DC-10 jet to be used only by NBC Nightly News and
other NBC affiliates, Carter said.
   But it played on stations across the country _ including rival
KCAU in Sioux City _ after it was transmitted from Sioux City to
NBC in New York via a satellite channel owned by Minneapolis-based
Conus Communications.
   Conus, a news service that feeds 133 television stations, said
it obtained the footage from WOWT of Omaha, Neb., one of its
members. KTIV has a reciprocal agreement to share footage with
WOWT, which was sent to transmit the footage to NBC News, said
Conus spokesman Steve Blum.
   Technical and time restraints prompted WOWT to use Conus'
satellite channel to transmit the video instead of feeding it
directly to NBC, Blum said.
   After being assured by WOWT and a KTIV reporter in the WOWT
truck that the two stations shared videotapes, Conus made the video
available to its members through WOWT, Blum said.
   Conus later talked to a KTIV manager, who granted Conus the
rights to the video for $300, Blum said.
   ``We weren't trying to rip anybody off,'' Blum said. ``We got
permission.''
   Carter said the situation with Conus was confusing, and that
Conus may not be at fault. But he said Conus should have checked
with him, not a reporter, before releasing the video.
   Carter said he granted ABC permission to use the tape after the
``cat was out of the bag,'' but demanded that ABC affiliate KCAU be
excluded from the distribution.
   ``They went ahead and did anyway,'' Carter said. ``Finally, 24
hours after the fact they stopped using it.''
   Carter said his station obtained the footage of the jet by
dispatching camera crews to the scene nearly 30 minutes before the
crash.
   The news station was tipped off to the upcoming emergency
landing by reports on the local police radio.

   An attachment to the engine that may have
exploded in flight aboard United Airlines Flight 232 was repaired a
day before the plane crashed in Iowa, but the head investigator
said Friday he had no indication the work was related the engine's
failure.
   Government records show that DC-10s with CF6-6 engines have had
six previous engine failures in which damage extended beyond the
engine.
   The builder, General Electric Co., and a Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman said the CF6-6, which is used only on
tri-jet DC-10s, has a good performance record.
   The rear engine that investigators say may have exploded in
flight and disabled hydraulic flight control systems before the
United DC-10 crashed Wednesday at Sioux City had been on the
15-year-old plane for about nine months, said a spokesman for Rep.
James Oberstar, D-Minn, who heads a House aviation subcommittee.
   Oberstar obtained information about the plane from a United
Airlines vice president.
   Airline spokesman Herb Gardner in Chicago said all maintenance
records concerning the aircraft, one of 56 DC-10s in United's
fleet, had been turned over to the National Transportation Safety
Board. ``We just simply do not provide any of that information once
its been given to the board,'' he said.
   A spokesman for Oberstar said the congressman had not learned
whether the repair work done on the engine had anything to do with
the system that failed.
   Safety board member Jim Burnett, who is supervising
investigators in Sioux City, confirmed that unspecified repairs
were performed on the aircraft's tail engine on Tuesday. ``We have
no indication at this time that that was something that could have
affected the course of the accident,'' he said.
   He said the work was on the plane's pneumatic system, which uses
excess air pressure generated by the giant jet engine to power the
aircraft's air-conditioning system. The pneumatic system is
attached to the engine.
   Burnett acknowledged Friday that pieces of metal spewing from a
disintegrating rear engine could have caused the small holes found
in the horizontal stabilizer and could have severed hydraulic lines
in the tail, but he said investigators were far from concluding
what caused the crash.
   Burnett said preliminary findings showed that the horizontal
stabilizer, the small wing-like structures on each side of the
tail, had several holes and the hydraulic system had lost all
fluid. The hydraulic system is routed through the tail and allows
the pilot to manipulate wing and tail controls.
   Early Friday evening, Burnett said examination of the hydraulic
lines showed two were severed cleanly and the third suffered such
impact damage it was impossible to tell whether it had been cut.
   The rear engine was either brand new or newly rebuilt when it
was installed last October, said Jim Berard, Oberstar's spokesman.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said CF6-6 engines have been the
subject of seven ``airworthiness directives'' since they went into
service in 1972. ``This doesn't mean there is a problem but that a
problem was solved and corrected,'' he said. Such directives
ordinarily order airliners to make modifications on the engines or
in procedures for maintaining them.
   The most recent order was in late 1988 and involved replacement
of an engine shaft after 17,600 flights, Farrar said.
   The GE engine originally was built lighter than engines made by
competitors, with relatively thin fan blades, but the design was
changed because the blades tended to break up, a United Airlines
official disclosed after a 1979 Chicago DC-10 crash that killed 274
people. That crash was blamed on faulty maintenance procedures.
   Farrar said the CF6-6 engines have a good shutdown record, with
one automatic or pilot-directed shutdown for about every 30,000
flying hours, a normal record for such an engine.
   Airliners must be able to fly with one engine out. Farrar said
the three-engined DC-10 also could fly with two engine failures but
if that were necessary, the strain on the third engine might damage
it.
   David Lane, spokesman for General Electric's aircraft engine
division, said 469 of the CF6-6 engines are in service. Only one
flight in 2,000 has been delayed or cancelled because of a CF6-6
problem, he said.
   ``That's an admirable record,'' he said.
   Lane said the company would have no comment on specifics
involved in the Souix City crash investigation.

<HEAD>Bloch Warned of Little U.S. Influence on Common Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Felix S. Bloch, the diplomat being
investigated by the FBI and the State Department as a possible
Soviet spy, wrote a recent article warning fellow diplomats that
the United States has little ability to influence the European
Common Market.
   Bloch's article appears in the July-August edition of the
Foreign Service Journal, the magazine of the Foreign Service
Association, the professional organization for American diplomats.
   His contribution, entitled ``The European Community,'' sketches
what he called the ``intricate and enigmatic'' relationships,
emphasizing trade, of the United States with the institutions of
the Common Market.
   He said Americans had three common misconceptions about Europe:
that trade barriers within Europe will be removed in 1992, that the
community is just a place where member countries meet and has no
power itself, and that the community has no political dimension.
   In trade, he said, ``both sides seem trapped by their threats,''
unable to negotiate without deadlines for carrying out threats.
Since it is difficult to get a multi-member body to agree on an
initiative, ``both sides have come to expect the United States
always to be the initiator of trade negotiations, the first to make
a proposal and the one expected to make the last concession.''
   ``It must be recognized that the nature of our relations is to a
large extent dictated by the state of the evolving community,''
Bloch wrote.
   ``We can neither force nor delay the pace of European
unification and can deal with (Common Market) institutions only to
the extent that the community agrees that they should deal with us.
Decisions being made in Europe are very important to the United
States, but our ability to influence them is small.''

   Now that President Bush has endorsed ``a
journey into tomorrow'' _ a tomorrow that includes people living
and working on the moon and Mars _ Congress will first have to give
NASA a space haven closer to home.
   It's called Space Station Freedom, an orbiting laboratory, that
was to have become a reality in 1992 but will be lucky to be built
in time to greet the 21st century.
   Only a few hours after Bush spoke Thursday, the station survived
another financial cliffhanger in the House of Representatives, one
of a long series.
   When President Ronald Reagan proposed the station in 1984, the
cost for that single component of a moon-Mars future was estimated
to be $8 billion. Today's guess is $30 billion and some experts say
even that won't come close.

   Coal miners in Siberia are
returning to work today after exacting promises of better food,
housing and working conditions, but the wave of unrest they
launched continued to spread to other coal regions.
   Despite President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's sweeping concessions _
including granting miners greater control over their industry _ new
coal strikes were reported Thursday from Soviet Central Asia to
near the Polish border.
   More than a week after the outbreak of the Soviet Union's worst
labor turmoil in six decades, tens of thousands of miners remained
off the job.
   Gorbachev has expressed sympathy for the strikers and placed
much of the blame for the miners' deteriorating working and living
conditions on leaders of the officially sanctioned trade unions.

   President Bush's final clean air bill is
sparking stinging criticism from environmentalists because it would
ease an early draft's requirements for reducing motor vehicle
pollution and provide wide government latitude to meet industry's
concerns.
   An Environmental Protection Agency summary of the legislation
was given to members of Congress Thursday and made available by
lawmakers to reporters. The summary showed the final version, to be
sent to Congress today, was changed from a preliminary draft that
was written June 30.
   The new language, compared to the earlier draft, would push back
new emissions standards for cars, trucks and buses, and would give
the EPA administrator discretion to delay new regulations even
further.
   Other provisions of the final bill, some known previously, would
give the administrator, local governments and industry flexibility
in taking measures to reduce ozone pollution, acid rain and
airborne toxic chemicals. The EPA chief could specifically address
industry's economic costs in making key decisions.

   William Lucas is losing ground in his bid to
become the Bush administration's civil rights enforcer, with a key
lawmaker executing a stunning about-face one day after delivering
his support.
   ``It obviously hurts the Lucas candidacy _ how much I can't
quantify,'' Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said Thursday after Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., told the Senate Judiciary Committee he could no
longer support the nominee.
   As civil rights leaders renewed criticism of the nominee,
committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said he was not satisfied
with Lucas' testimony and added he was inclined to oppose the
nominee when the committee votes, perhaps as early as next Thursday.
   Conyers' turnaround came as a political blow to the
administration, which enlisted the Michigan lawmaker to stand in
after the state's senators refused to introduce Lucas at his
confirmation hearing. Senators normally extend that courtesy to
nominees regardless of party.

   AIDS patients may have up to 1,000 times more
diseased blood cells than previously believed, making it even
harder to stamp out the virus that causes the fatal disease,
according to a National Institutes of Health study published today.
   In a study led by Steven M. Schnittman of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, researchers discovered that in
a patient with active AIDS the virus that causes the disease can
infect up to 1 percent _ 1 of every 100 _ of a blood cell known as
the T4 lymphocyte.
   Schnittman said in an interview that previous studies, which
used indirect measurements of the infection rate, had calculated
that only 1 in every 10,000 to 100,000 of the T4 lymphocytes in
such a patient were infected.
   The higher rate of infection, a factor that doctors call ``virus
load,'' suggests that it will be more difficult to develop a
therapy to find and eliminate each and every pocket of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which causes AIDS.

   Stubby water pipes follow the washboard
gravel road twisting through the hills of rural Mississippi,
bringing people a taste of the 20th century they find as
significant as the first human steps on the moon.
   ``When you've had to haul water from a creek or collect
rainwater off the roof all your life, having it brought to your
doorstep is as important to us as when they walked on the moon,''
Charles Savage said this week.
   For now, however, the 36-year-old laborer's bathroom is still an
outhouse.
   Until money can be found to install and hook up indoor plumbing,
Savage's family and others in the community will have to keep
drawing water from the new plastic pipes that stick out of the
ground outside each home.
   A federally financed project completed the main line down the
road two weeks ago, and a church group paid to run pipe to each
home. Now a charity effort is under way to collect used fixtures
and the money to install them.
   Most residents in Blue Hill, named for the forest-covered blue
clay hills in sparsely populated Jefferson County, live in poverty.
Only a couple families have the luxury of a private well.
   Unemployment in the southwest Mississippi county runs 23.4
percent, the highest in the state.

<TEXT>
   For 12 years, Dr. Albert Johnston and his
wife had a secret _ a secret they kept from friends, neighbors,
even their children.
   But in 1941, their secret came out _ each was part black. The
fair-skinned Johnstons had raised four children and built a life in
Keene and Gorham, N.H., while passing as white.
   Eight years later, the whole world knew their story when it was
presented, lightly fictionalized, in the 1949 film ``Lost
Boundaries,'' in which Mel Ferrer (``El Greco,'' ``War and Peace'')
made his screen debut.
   The doctor is now dead, but his family and members of the
movie's cast and crew were to reunite in Keene today with a
screening and small reception to celebrate a revolutionary film and
friendships that withstood a revelation that was, in its time,
shocking.
   ``That was the point of the story, the fact that something
positive happened, that there wasn't any problem as a result of
it,'' recalled Albert Johnston Jr.
   Albert Johnston, a Chicago native, and his blue-eyed wife, Thyra
Baumann, born in New Orleans, had no thought of ``passing'' after
their 1924 marriage when he was a pre-med student at the University
of Chicago. But things changed when he tried to find work as an
intern. Hospitals that accepted black interns were full, and others
would not accept him because he was part black.
   At last, Maine General Hospital in Portland accepted Johnston
without asking his race. In 1929, the internship over, the family
moved to Gorham, N.H., and Johnston went into successful private
practice.
   The family moved to Boston in 1937 so Johnston could study
radiology at Harvard Medical School. He returned to Gorham a year
later, moving to Keene in 1939. It was there, just before World War
II, that the truth came out.
   In 1941, he volunteered for the Navy and won a lieutenant
commander's commission in July. But a few days later, a Navy
intelligence officer visited the doctor and said, ``We understand .
.. you have colored blood in your veins.''
   ``Who knows what blood any of us has in his veins?'' Johnston
replied.
   About a month later, he was notified that his commission had
been revoked because of an ``inability to meet naval physical
requirements.'' He then told his children about their background.
   Despite the family's fears, townspeople's feelings were
generally unchanged when the news spread, which surprised the
Johnstons and many others.
   ``I would say 80 percent of the people didn't care, didn't make
any difference. Why would it?'' Albert Jr. said from Hawaii, where
he and his parents moved in the 1960s.
   ``If you'd lived in New Hampshire all your life, knew all your
friends ... they're going to be surprised, they're going to be
amazed, but they're still your friends. There were, of course, a
certain small amount of people who were die-hards who would have
always lived with a sense of bigotry.''
   In the movie, however, the family is roundly rejected once their
secret is revealed.
   It was Albert Jr., then a music theory student, who got the film
started by telling the family story to producer Louis de Rochemont,
who lived in Newington at the time. The ``March of Time'' producer
sent author W.L. White to write the family's story, which was
printed in Reader's Digest in 1947.
   De Rochemont, now dead, fought with MGM over suggested script
changes and ended up financing the film himself. He shot it in New
Hampshire and Maine seacoast towns.
   When ``Lost Boundaries'' came out _ premiering in Keene on July
24, 1949 _ it was banned in some cities. But it was lauded by Life
and Newsweek magazines and The New York Times, in which critic
Bosley Crowther said it had ``extraordinary courage, understanding
and dramatic power.'' The movie won the best script prize at the
Cannes Film Festival.
   ``This was a very, very radical departure from any kind of
fiction film anybody was making in the country,'' Ferrer said,
noting its documentary style and controversial topic. ``It was a
picture which broke a tremendous number of shibboleths, and it
established a new freedom in making films.''
   Albert Jr. said de Rochemont deliberately picked unknown white
actors _ Ferrer and the late Beatrice Pearson, who had been in only
one film before ``Lost Boundaries'' and who abandoned her career a
short time later.
   Though some critics, film buffs and historians have criticized
the movie for casting whites in the lead roles, as was done in
other movies at that time such as ``Show Boat'' and ``Pinky,'' the
film did feature a few black actors, including Canada Lee and Leigh
Whipper.
   The movie also has been criticized for creating an unbelievable
premise: that the couple are forced to leave their black community
because other blacks reject their ``whiteness.'' At that time, well
before the slogan of ``black is beautiful'' permeated society, fair
skin was more acceptable in the black community than dark skin.
   Keene and Gorham were fictionalized as the single ``Keenham,''
character names were changed (the family became the Carters) and
the family reduced to two children in the film, directed by Alfred
L. Werker. But most incidents were authentic, Albert Jr. said.
   ``Lost Boundaries'' fell into obscurity when the company that
owned it, Film Classics, folded; its catalog was sold to Warner
Bros. The chance of re-releasing or televising it now is slim
because it's unclear who owns the distribution rights. The movie
had been shown on television years ago.
   ``I think it's the best picture I was ever in as an actor,''
said the 71-year-old Ferrer in a telephone interview from his home
outside Santa Barbara, Calif. ``I still feel that way. ... I
thought it was a great opportunity for all of us.''
   Ferrer, who went on to become a producer and director, felt
strongly enough about the story to go against the advice of his
booking agency and make his screen debut in the film. The move
could have destroyed his career. ``But all of us had a certain real
conviction about the theme of the picture and the content of the
picture, and I didn't hesitate.''
   The Johnston family was, and is, proud that their story was used
to promote racial understanding, said Albert Jr., a 63-year-old
retired department store buyer and composer.
   ``We thought it was quite a historical first, and that it
contributed immensely to the thinking of society,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The 39-year-old former governor of
one of Brazil's poorest states has surged to the forefront of the
nation's presidential race, overtaking a veteran populist and a
radical leftist.
   Fernando Collor de Mello of Alagoas in the impoverished
Northeast is attacting voter attention with a clean-government
platform and pro-business views in a nation deep in debt and
ravaged by inflation.
   He is leading national public opinion polls by a 3-1 margin,
outscoring two previous front-runners, long-time populist Leonel
Brizola of the Democratic Labor Party and unionist Luis Inacio Lula
da Silva of the radical left Workers Party.
   Collor de Mello's supporters call him a bold reformer, capable
of ``moralizing'' Brazil's bureaucracy.
   Critics maintain he is a shallow, prefabricated candidate with
hazy ideas and questionable financial dealings as governor of
Alagoas.
   But his popularity grows, nevertheless.
   In mid-July, Collor de Mello got a 41-percent rating in a survey
by one leading poll taker. Brizola, his closest rival, had 12
percent and Da Silva wound up with 7 percent. A Gallup poll at the
same time gave Collor de Mello 45 percent, with Brizola remaining
at 12 and Da Silva dropping to 5{ percent.
   ``I reached this position without the support of any governor,
senator, big businessman, banker or the military,'' Collor de Mello
said after the poll results were released. ``My candidacy was born
in the sentiment of the nation.''
   Brazilians will choose a successor to President Jose Sarney on
Nov. 15 in the first popular balloting for president in 29 years.
Direct presidential elections were banned by a right-wing military
regime that ruled from 1964 to 1985.
   Collor de Mello presents himself as an independent candidate
without ties to vested interests. He calls himself a ``Christian
reformer'' and ideologically left of center.
   However, his opponents call him ``the new face of the right.''
His pro-business ideas are drawing conservatives to his newly
formed National Reconstruction Party.
   Collor de Mello first attracted national attention when, as
governor, he refused to pay the exorbitant salaries of an elite
group of civil servants, popularly known as ``maharajas.''
   His refusal struck a chord among Brazilians who read almost
daily accounts of official graft and corruption, while most workers
earn close to the minimum wage of about $40 a month.
   His clean-government crusade has become the heart of his
presidential campaign.
   Collor de Mello has been a sharp critic of Sarney, a 59-year-old
rancher and poet who took office in 1985 when the military stepped
down. Many blame Sarney's government for 1,000 percent inflation
and rampant corruption.
   Collor de Mello was born Aug. 12, 1949, into a wealthy and
powerful family in Alagoas, a state dominated by sugar barons and
known for its bloody political feuds. In Alagoas, he heads the
family owned Gazeta media group, which includes a newspaper, a TV
station, three radio stations and a publishing house.
   His political career began when he joined the military regime's
Social Democratic Party in the 1970s. In 1979 he was appointed
mayor of Maceio, the capital of Alagoas. Three years later he was
elected to Congress.
   In 1985, Collor de Mello sided with the military and voted for
the party's presidential candidate, Paulo Maluf, in an electoral
college election. He says it was a question of party loyalty, but
the vote still haunts him.
   Maluf lost to opposition candidate Tancredo Neves, who died
before taking office. His running mate Sarney became president.
   In 1986, Collor de Mello switched to Sarney's Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party and was elected governor. Last year he
resigned from the party in a split with Sarney and began his run
for president.
   As a candidate, Collor de Mello has made crowd-pleasing promises
to sell Cabinet ministers' mansions in Brasilia and to disband the
feared National Intelligence Service, a secret police operation.
   He claims Brazil's $112 billion foreign debt, the largest in the
Third World, is ``unpayable,'' but he adds that he will not stop
payments on it. Instead, he proposes withdrawing the federal
government's guarantees on loans for state-run companies and state
governments.
   ``My proposal is unconventional,'' he says. ``I don't intend to
welsh or declare a moratorium. I want to play within the rules.
Withdrawing federal guarantees will send a signal to creditors that
will promote a broad renegotiation.''
   A top priority, he says, is attracting more foreign investment.
   ``We need money, we need investment, we need development,'' he
said.
   ``I don't think like some who see in foreign capital the
presence of the dominator, the colonizer. That's a mistaken view.
The only way to development is to establish a healthy partnership
with capital.''
   He also proposes to eliminate the controversial ``market
reserve'' policy that bars large numbers of foreign-made computers
from Brazil.
   ``This is backwardness, clientelism, paternalism,'' he said.
``If we're going to install capitalism here, then let's do it all
the way. And this is anything but capitalism.''
   Critics claim Collor de Mello's record belies his claims as a
corruption fighter.
   As governor, Collor de Mello made a settlement considered overly
generous in a tax dispute with the state's sugar barons. And he
appointed thousands to state jobs on the eve of his resignation to
run for president.
   Justice Minister Oscar Dias Correa ordered federal police to
investigate the charges of corruption.

   Chris Burke says ``it's very wonderful'' to
get to play his character, Corky, on TV this fall in ABC's new
series ``Life Goes On.''
   ``To become an actor who has Down's syndrome I think is very
great,'' Burke said.
   Burke's character, like himself, suffers from the birth defect
that is a cause of mental retardation.
   ``Life Goes On,'' a realistic family drama, is one of the few
innovations from the networks this fall.
   Burke plays 18-year-old Corky, the middle child of Drew and
Libby Thatcher, played by Bill Smitrovich and Patti LuPone. In the
series, Corky, who has spent his school years in special education,
is just embarking on life in a ``normal'' high school.
   His younger sister Becca (Kelly Martin) must cope with going to
the same school as her brother. To complicate matters, Paige
(Monique Lanier), a grown daughter from Drew's previous marriage,
has broken up with a boyfriend and moved in.
   Burke appeared at a news conference with other members of the
cast and creator and executive producer of ``Life Goes On,''
Michael Braverman.
   Braverman said the series was developed around Burke, who had
appeared as a peripheral character in a pilot movie Braverman had
produced.
   ``Although ABC did not pick up that pilot, they loved Chris so
much in it, they asked me if I could do something to develop a show
that featured him. The result was ``Life Goes On.''
   Braverman said he has been closely involved with Down's syndrome
support groups because he has a relative who suffers from it, but
does not employ a technical adviser on the show.
   ``There's no greater expert than Chris. If Chris says he can do
something, or couldn't do something, or wouldn't do something, I
take that prima facie.''
   Burke is not severely retarded and had little difficulty dealing
with the room full of television critics, occasionally blushing and
giggling in the midst of a lengthy answer. Braverman said the
reason Burke is an actor is the desire he's had to be one since he
was 5.
   Burke himself described wanting to ``burst into tears'' when he
went to one drama workshop and saw the other students performing
with such ease.
   There is a full-time drama coach on the set for Burke, Braverman
said, adding, ``and it would well serve many other actors as
well.'' Smitrovich leaned forward and asked, ``You talking about
this show, or your other past experiences.''
   After the news conference, Smitrovich talked about the joys and
difficulties of working with someone like Chris Burke.
   ``It requires a little more patience, to be truthful,''
Smitrovich said. ``You know, Corky's a very special Down's syndrome
child, ... because Corky's not severely retarded. But in the
process of working on a film it's a long day, you have to maintain
a certain level of concentration. There are a lot of distractions,
and, as you might know, children with Down's syndrome can be
distracted quite easily. But someone once said that Down's
syndrome, they have something extra, so I look at Corky as having
something extra. ... And he works hard and we get it done. And
sometimes there's a nice subtle variable in his character. He's
able to add nuance to it, unlike other actors who are straight and
playing someone retarded.''
   ABC has scheduled the show on Sunday night, opposite CBS'
powerhouse ``60 Minutes.''
   ``I don't think anybody expects us to beat `60 Minutes,''' said
Braverman. ``We're going to play our own game.''
   Someone asked Braverman whether it was ``risky'' to put on a
show with a central character who has Down's syndrome and suggested
that perhaps the character played by Larry Drake on ``L.A. Law''
had made it acceptable for there to be retarded characters on
network shows.
   ``We didn't feel it was in any way risky, because we're hoping
to make you feel good with it,'' said Braverman.

   Three years ago investigative reporter Elaine
Shannon took a leave from her job, withdrew her savings and set out
to nail down the story of high-level corruption behind the murder
of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena in Mexico.
   It was more than just a whodunit for Shannon. She found the
political immorality spread by the drug barons was pervasive in
Mexico and there was a massive cover-up.
   She also found that the Reagan White House and State Department
were equally reluctant to see the murder investigation pursued
because it was disruptive of American foreign policy. Some
courageous officials, however, resisted pressure and pushed the
investigation.
   Camarena, an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration, was
abducted on Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara, Mexico. He was tortured
and murdered by the drug lords he was trying to bring to justice.
   Shannon tells the whole dirty story in her book ``Desperados,''
which has been made into a six-hour NBC miniseries called ``Drug
Wars: The Camarena Story.''
   The three-part series, to be shown this fall, stars Steven Bauer
as Camarena, Elizabeth Pena as his wife, Mika, and Craig T. Nelson
and Treat Williams as drug agents. Michael Mann (``Miami Vice'')
was executive producer.
   ``I traveled in Mexico and the Southwest, particularly
California, and talked to everybody I could find who knew about the
murder,'' said Shannon on a visit to Los Angeles. Shannon, who is
expecting her first child next month, is married to Dan Morgan of
the Washington Post. She spent 10 years covering the Department of
Justice for Newsweek, which she left after beginning the book. She
currently works for Time in Washington.
   ``This is really about American policy. We have agents all over
the world. Are they being supported by our embassies and our
government? I talked to Mexican officials last. I didn't want them
following me around and seeing who I was talking to.
   ``There is a lot of information out there. I didn't have to use
the Freedom of Information Act at all. I talked to a lot of Customs
agents who had seen the explosion of drugs coming in through the
South. Cocaine and marijuana comes almost exclusively from Latin
America.''
   With the help of investigators here and abroad, Shannon was able
to put together a picture of the corruption and cover-up.
   ``In Mexico corruption is a way of life,'' she said. ``It's
essential to the drug traffic. Whenever corruption is exposed the
person is usually allowed to quietly resign.''
   Shannon said Camarena, a very moral and dedicated man,
volunteered for duty in Guadalajara because it's the only place
outside of Colombia to find the drug lords. She said he was killed
when he got too close to the drug bosses, as well as their
high-ranking allies in the Mexican government and police.
   She describes an incident in the book in which American agents
watched helplessly as a top official of the Mexican Federal
Judicial Police allowed an escape by a suspected drug kingpin
behind the murder. Informants told the agents he promised $270,000
to the official.
   Shannon also tells of opposition from the U.S. State Department
and the White House to the murder investigation.
   ``Not because of corruption but because the agents bother
important people,'' she said. ``The American banking community also
raised hell when the Customs Service ordered strict inspection of
vehicles at the border. It effectively shut down the border and the
bankers complained that it disrupted trade.''
   Shannon said she was pleased that Michael Mann produced the
series because drug dealers had been portrayed as villains on
``Miami Vice.''
   ``In so many movies you see the stars taking dope and
giggling,'' she said. ``Mann made these people the bad guys. I was
concerned that the book not be cheap entertainment or lose its
dignity. He was zealous about the realism, and respectful of the
characters.''
   Shannon points out in her book that a number of agents and
others put their careers on the line to press ahead with the
investigation and speak out against the corruption.
   ``One of the messages I hope comes through in this is that while
law enforcement people can take direct action, all of us face
choices,'' she said. ``We can do things to help. We can refuse to
be a part of a lie. Many people I interviewed did that and I
greatly admire them.''

   It was raining in Queens when two of my friends and I began what
normally is a two-hour drive to Bethel, N.Y., a spot on the map
that didn't exist to most people before the early summer of 1969.
   ``It's in the middle of the Catskills,'' I mentioned knowingly,
having spent most of my childhood summers in that area. ``Near
White Lake, not far from Monticello.''
   Right. In a couple of hours, we'd be jamming with Joe Cocker,
cruising with Crosby, Stills and Nash.
   As I headed to the concert that would attract nearly half a
million people and the attention of the world, all I could think
about was the music. The Who, the Airplane, Janis Joplin, Jimi
Hendrix, Creedence, Sly.
   The first inkling that this wasn't going to be your normal
weekend came from the radio as we drove north.
   ``The concert at Bethel already is a disaster,'' the newscaster
said. ``Local law enforcement officials are warning people to stay
away. Traffic is backed up for miles, there aren't enough supplies
at the site, tickets are useless because the fences surrounding the
area have been torn down and the weather forecast calls for heavy
rain.''
   Time to speed up. Don't want to miss any of this.
   About 90 minutes later, we approached the beginning of the
Catskill region. We noticed dozens of hitchhikers with backpacks,
coolers, even collapsed lean-tos. But no traffic jams; no rain.
   The exit ramp we needed was uphill. You don't see Route 17B
until you're practically on it. We never got on it. It was blocked
by state troopers, who were detouring all cars _ away from the
Band, Richie Havens, Canned Heat and Arlo Guthrie.
   Damn.
   ``Don't worry,'' I said with too much smugness. ``I know the
back roads.''
   ``All roads to Bethel are closed, blocked by hundreds of cars
filled with frustrated rock 'n' roll fans,'' the radio man was
saying, with nearly as much smugness as I displayed moments earlier.
   ``Not these roads, baby,'' I replied.
   We drove almost to the foot of the great meadow on Max Yasgur's
farm. All we needed was to get around a bend that would lead
directly to the site. Except there was no road left. It had become
a parking lot. So we pulled into a ditch, locked up the car and _
minus blankets, spare clothes and, I guess, our senses _ we headed
toward the music.
   After walking less than a mile, it began to rain.
Four-and-a-half miles further, we climbed a short hill and ...
   People.
   And more people.
   The music had stopped in deference to the weather. But the waves
of humanity didn't stop within my field of sight.
   And nobody was complaining. They were soaking wet, hungry,
disappointed that the stage was, for now, empty.
   They didn't yell about it. They didn't fight. They shared what
they had. One group let us crawl underneath a makeshift tent of
plastic and gave us beer and potato chips, which wound up being the
bill of fare for the weekend.
   The storm ended early enough for the concert to resume. We were
at least one-quarter mile from the stage, back near the concession
stands that were closed. There was a distinct aroma in the air, but
it had nothing to do with barbecues.
   Late Friday night, Joan Baez sang ``We Shall Overcome,'' and
anyone who had something they could light did so.
   We found space under one of the closed concessions and slept the
best we could. That afternoon, I got my introduction to Santana, as
did thousands of others who would make ``Soul Sacrifice'' an anthem
for Woodstock. It could have been 200 degrees in the shade and it
wouldn't have been as hot as the set Santana played.
   And Creedence Clearwater Revival, the group I most wanted to
hear. The four-member band put a spell on the crowd from beginning
to end with probably their best live performance ever.
   At night, there was Joplin screaming her way through ballads,
Sly getting everyone up to dance to the music and The Who
presenting the rock opera ``Tommy'' until dawn.
   Sunday morning _ and the Jefferson Airplane was just starting
its set.
   I must have been sleeping when Joe Cocker got started. I had
heard of him but didn't expect the near-spastic movements, the
gravelly voice, the lack of all conventions. I loved it.
   By now, however, the lack of substantial meals, the squalor of
the portable bathrooms and the general discomfort were more than
annoying. By early Sunday evening, a lot of people had left.
   As Cocker was finishing, it began to rain.
   A chant of ``No Rain, No Rain,'' began. Instead, we got more
rain, more rain.
   When it stopped, we thought of leaving. But Country Joe and the
Fish came on stage. The festive mood was long since gone, but the
music wasn't.
   Later Sunday, Yasgur made a speech and got a tremendous ovation,
the kind you heard when Joe Namath threw a touchdown pass.
   That night, Crosby, Stills and Nash performed. They would become
megastars, but they were awful at Woodstock. The crowd was getting
antsy to hear Hendrix and go home, and the out-of-synch vocals of
this new group were bothersome.
   I fell asleep.
   I remember waking up and hearing ``Teen Angel'' playing on
someone's radio, except there weren't any nearby. So I walked
toward the stage and saw these guys dressed in gold lame outfits
dancing around, posturing and singing hits from the '50s. Sha Na
Na. Somehow, they seemed to fit just right.
   By the time Hendrix appeared, the crowd had thinned to a more
manageable 100,000 or so. I knew this was the end and, for the only
time I can remember, it didn't matter if Hendrix played five songs
or five hours.
   As he played the ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' I took my watch
from my pocket and looked at it for the first time all weekend.
   A few years later, I went back with my fiancee. Jimi was gone.
So was Janis. It was nothing more than a big, lush cow pasture. No
crowds. No music.
   ``It didn't seem special then,'' I said. ``It was just a great
concert.
   ``But if I ever get the chance to go back and relive one
experience, this would be it.''

   Every other month, cemetery workers tending Jimi
Hendrix's grave replace the lawn worn away by fans.
   Every day they take away the offerings left near his granite
marker the night before: marijuana butts, lighters, guitar picks.
   Twenty years after Woodstock _ and 19 years after Hendrix _
admirers still come to sit and think about the young man who helped
define psychedelic rock.
   When Hendrix cranked up his Fender Stratocaster, the Earth
became ``The Third Stone From the Sun,'' and a nation of rebellious
youth grooved to ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
   When he hit Woodstock in August 1969, his music and his career
were soaring. A year and a month later they crashed.
   He died in his sleep Sept. 18, 1970, while on a European tour.
The coroner's report said he choked on his own vomit. The trace of
barbituates in his blood was small, not enough to kill, the coroner
said.
   Hendrix was born in Seattle in 1942. He left Garfield High
School after his junior year to join the Army because he didn't
want to spend another summer mowing the lawns for his father's
landscape business.
   ``He wanted one of those screaming eagles on his shoulder,''
said James A. ``Al'' Hendrix, referring to the patch worn by
paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division.
   Hendrix served after Korea and before Vietnam, when lyrics from
his songs would be scribbled on soldiers' helmets.
   He went by Jimmy in those days and was shy, his father said. The
shortened name and stage antics, such as squirting lighter fluid on
his burning guitar, were just show business he adopted later.
   ``He was a good boy,'' the 70-year-old Hendrix said. ``He played
Little League, football, swimming. We called him `Buster' 'til he
was 9 or 10. Then he wanted to be called Jimmy.''
   Jimmy and his younger brother, Leon, were raised by their
father. His parents were divorced and his mother died when he was
10.
   The family's console record player filled the rooming house
where they lived with B.B. King and Muddy Waters, and young Jimmy
mimicked the records, using a broom for a guitar.
   ``I had this old ukelele from one of my jobs,'' said his father,
a former musician in Vancouver, British Columbia. ``I gave it to
him. Of course he couldn't get much music out of it.''
   So Al Hendrix paid a friend $5 for his acoustic guitar and gave
it to Jimmy. The first electric guitar was bought at a music shop
along with a saxophone for dad. When they fell behind on payments,
the sax went back, but the electric guitar stayed.
   ``I told him he'd go farther with that guitar than I would with
the sax,'' Hendrix said with a laugh. ``I never did get him an amp.
He used to plug into his friends'. Still, he got music out of it.
The Peter Gunn theme was one of the first things I remember him
playing.''
   Hendrix didn't return to Seattle when a back injury from a
parachute jump ended his military career. Instead, he headed East
in search of the music scene, and played in backup bands for the
Supremes, the Isley Brothers and Little Richard.
   Hendrix's guitar playing attracted a record producer who took
him to England. He became ``Jimi.'' Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding
were added to make the Jimi Hendrix Experience.
   The band conquered Europe, and played at the Monterey Pop
Festival in 1967, which led to a record contract and a tour with
the Monkees, the made-for-television pop group. Predictably, the
music styles clashed and the tour was cut short. By August 1969,
the Experience was finished but Hendrix's music was taking off. He
formed the short-lived Band of Gypsies with Buddy Miles and Billy
Cox, whom he'd met in the Army.
   Hendrix left behind a rich musical legacy, influencing a
generation of musicians such as Prince and Eric Clapton. His
records still are among the best sellers at many stores. The heart
of his discography remains ``Are You Experienced?,'' ``Axis: Bold
as Love'' and ``Electric Ladyland.''
   Seattle has been slow to honor Hendrix, partly because his
reputation for drugs and sex didn't seem exemplary for young
citizens. Garfield High School put his bust in the second-floor
library and, when city fathers balked at a plaque in a city park,
the British director of Seattle's zoo volunteered a spot.
   Today, visitors must stand on the Jimi Hendrix memoril rocks for
the best view of the giraffes, zebras and gazelles in the zoo's
African savanna exhibit.
   A bronze sunburst marks the spot, and a sign in the shrubs
nearby reads: ``There's no telling how many lives your spirit will
go through _ die and be reborn.'' _ Jimi Hendrix.

   Three million of its people died in the fighting
to establish Bangladesh as a nation 18 years ago and in peace it is
assailed by death and destruction at the hands of nature and man.
But while tragedy after tragedy befalls Bangladesh, it survives.
Here is a report on the hard luck country of the Asian subcontinent.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Throughout this impoverished nation,
whose short history has been plagued by some of the worst disasters
man and nature can devise, people struggle from one day to the next
just to survive.
   Situated in a storm-tossed alley at the head of the Bay of
Bengal, Bangladesh is alternately seared by droughts or awash in
tidal waves and monsoon floods. It is pummeled by tornadoes and
smashed by cyclones or hurricanes roaring in from the sea.
   Bangladeshis die by the thousands.
   Overloaded river ferries capsize with a regularity that tends to
trivialize the tragedy, drowning dozens and sometimes hundreds of
people at a time.
   Strikes and riots by political parties, trade unions and Moslem
fundamentalists recur virtually every week, usually ending in
confrontations with police in which a score or more protesters are
wounded and a few die.
   But for most of the 110 million Bangladeshis, life goes on but
only on the edge.
   The average annual income is $160 a year. Eighty percent of the
people live below the poverty line, which means they can't obtain
minimum daily nutritional needs. At least 70 percent are illiterate.
   The plight of Mohammad Nobu, a 25-year-old farmer, is typical of
what can happen to a Bangladeshi.
   His one acre of land at the hamlet of Hargaj, 25 miles northwest
of Dhaka, provided enough rice and vegetables for his family. He
usually kept a cow and some chickens _ to sell, not to eat, because
money lasts longer than meat.
   But last fall he lost his rice crop to floods that submerged
three-fourths of the nation and killed an estimated 1,400 people.
   His next crop, winter lentils and vegetables, was washed away by
heavy rains.
   In April he lost his spring rice to tornadoes that killed
another 1,400 people, including his mother and aunt. He said the
storm also destroyed his tin-roofed bamboo hut and blew away ``a
big cow that I would have sold for 5,000 takas'' _ $152.
   Nobu, his wife and two small children now subsist on monthly
handouts: 33 pounds of rice from the government and 66 pounds of
flour from a private relief organization.
   ``It's all right,'' he said. ``We are surviving. We are waiting
for Allah's mercy.''
   In 1970, before it became independent from Pakistan, a hurricane
killed a million people in what then was East Pakistan. In 1985, a
hurricane and tidal way swept away 20,000 lives. This past
November, a cyclone killed 1,100.
   While people like Nobu await the mercy of Allah, the mercy of
wealthier nations in large part keeps Bangladesh going, to the tune
of $2 billion a year _ an amount equal to the country's annual
operating budget.
   But Bangladeshis and foreigners alike worry about the country
becoming too dependent on handouts.
   ``We have to prove to the world that Bangladesh is something
more than a poor country,'' President Hussain Muhammad Ershad said
recently while speaking of his desire to modernize his nation.
   In the meantime, the former army general who seized power in a
bloodless coup in 1982, has marshaled wide international support.
   ``Western donors are not unhappy with Ershad because he's
provided stability and there's been a vast improvement in human
rights,'' one foreign observer said, speaking on condition he was
not identified further.
   Bangladesh has had nine presidents since its 1971 independence
war with Pakistan in which 3 million people died. The only two
presidents who lasted longer than a few months were assassinated.
Leaders have never been installed by popular election.
   Foreign aid officials said Bangladesh has become such a popular
cause that they sometimes try to dissuade their governments from
pumping more money into an aid pipeline that has a five-year
backlog and a dispersal rate of 18 percent.
   Sheik Hasina, the daughter of independence leader Sheik Mujibur
Rahman and head of his Awami League that has been at the forefront
of the campaign to oust Ershad, contends that Bangladesh must wean
itself from foreign aid and achieve ``economic emancipation.''
   Her father, Bangladesh's first president, was assassinated in
1975 by young army officers in a coup in which his wife, three sons
and other relatives also were slain. Hasina, who says Sheik is her
name and not a title, was in India at the time and returned later
to pick up her father's political mantle.
   The key to Bangladesh's problems, she said in a recent
interview, is a literacy campaign that would generate a
better-skilled work force for an export-oriented economy.

<HEAD>Options On Flag Law</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With liberals flocking to support a law
against flag burning, Robert H. Bork said, smiling, it might stand
up in the Supreme Court for lack of lawyers to challenge it.
   He was joking, of course. Bork, the conservative whose Supreme
Court nomination was rejected by the Senate, believes that it will
take a constitutional amendment to reverse the court ruling that
permits flag burning in the name of free speech.
   As lawyers and legislators choose sides on flag measures, not
many are saying that the best thing to do is nothing. The issue is
so flammable that just about everybody wants action, or thinks it
inevitable.
   That's the point behind Bork's banter at a House hearing the
other day. The question has become whether to ban flag desecration
by act of Congress, or by amendment to the Constitution, rather
than whether it is necessary or desirable to do either.
   One exception: Charles Fried, another conservative scholar, and
solicitor general in the Reagan administration. Fried said Congress
should show leadership by forgoing any action, statute or
amendment. He said no American should be punished for even the most
offensive and bizarre expressions of dissent.
   But Fried is a Harvard University law professor, not a
politician. One way or another, Congress is going to vote to undo
the court ruling. In the Senate, there are to be votes on both
options _ an amendment and a statute. House Republicans want the
same thing. ``We deserve a straight up or down vote on the floor on
the ... amendment,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the GOP whip.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House panel that
heard a week of testimony on the flag controversy, said he thinks
Fried's counsel was sound, ``but it's such a loser.''
   He's siding with the people who say there ought to be a law, not
an amendment. Edwards acknowledged that many lawyers agree with
Bork that the court ruling on a constitutional issue cannot be
undone by statute. ``On our side we have just as many distinguished
lawyers who say that a statute will work,'' Edwards told Bork.
   The former appeals judge smiled.
   ``All of the people who might have been hired to challenge that
statute have now testified that it's constutitional,'' he said.
``So I suppose the statute might stand for that reason.''
   The court ruled 5-4 that burning the flag is a constitutionally
protected form of dissent. Bork said the decision was ``plainly
wrong.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who holds the seat Bork was denied
by the Senate in 1987, voted with the majority that overturned a
Texas statute banning flag burning.
   Congress will decide in the fall what to do about it. President
Bush advocates a constitutional amendment. Democrats are not going
to risk inaction. The alternative to an amendment is a statute
redrawn so as to flatly forbid desecration, without mentioning that
flag burning is offensive to others, which is what the Texas law
said.
   Bork says that won't suffice.
   On the other side of the debate stood an old foe, Laurence H.
Tribe, a constitutional lawyer who testified against Bork's Supreme
Court nomination before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Bork is
said to have shunned joint appearances ever since.
   Tribe spoke at the House flag burning hearing on Tuesday, a day
before Bork testified, and said a constitutional amendment would be
pointless folly.
   ``On its 200th birthday, the Bill of Rights deserves a better
present than a confusing and needless amendment,'' Tribe told the
House hearing. He argues that the court did not grant a right to
desecrate the flag, but ``required that government protection of
the flag be separated from government suppression of detested
views.'' Tribe said a flag desecration law written and enforced
without regard to any message would be upheld.
   Bork said it would be idle and dangerous to try to reverse a
constitutional ruling by passing a new law. ``The matter cannot be
cured by statute,'' he said.
   One way or another, there is an attempted cure coming, although
there has been little discussion of the ailment. Sen. Robert
Kerrey, D-Neb., who won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, noted that
lack.
   ``There simply is no line of Americans outside this building or
in this nation queuing up to burn our flag,'' he told the Senate.
``On the face of the evidence at hand, it seems to me that there is
no need for us to do anything.''

   Given conventional wisdom, Robert Mosbacher
should still be wandering the halls of the vast Commerce Department
bureaucracy in a daze, defeated at every turn by unfamiliar
government red tape.
   How could someone new to the Washington power game, overshadowed
by his dazzling socialite wife, possibly become a mover and shaker,
the skeptics asked.
   Perhaps no other member of the Bush Cabinet took office with
lower expectations than the president's choice for commerce
secretary. But in just five months in office, George Bush's
longtime friend has run up a string of successes. To wit:
   _He prevailed over determined opposition at the Defense
Department in getting a deal to develop the advanced FSX fighter
with Japan renegotiated on terms more favorable to the United
States.
   _He persuaded the president to accept his position to put Japan,
Brazil and India on a trade hit list, with the threat of stiff
sanctions unless the targeted countries agree to drop trade
barriers.
   _Using blunt talk about the need for ``a seat at the table,''
Mosbacher won concessions from the 12-nation European Community and
a promise to listen to U.S. concerns as Western Europe moves toward
a unified market in 1992.
   While impressed by his policy clout, detractors contend that
Mosbacher is exhibiting dangerous ``protectionist'' tendencies,
trying to cure the country's massive trade deficits by erecting
barriers that will hurt American consumers more than they will help
American producers.
   Mosbacher dismisses those complaints, contending that he learned
economics well during his school days and fully understands the
consumer benefits derived from an open global trading system. But
he says economic theory has to be tempered with ``the reality of
the world.''
   ``The goal is always free trade, but you can't have unilateral
free trade. It doesn't work,'' Mosbacher said in a recent interview
in his office, where he displays an embroidered pillow with the
legend, ``Free Trade Ave. Is a Two-Way Street.''
   Mosbacher's early successes have made the Commerce Department,
long considered a backwater agency with little impact on big
decisions, a player in Washington.
   Mosbacher, 62, adopts an aw-shucks pose, saying that in his 40
years in the oil business he learned that ``luck beats brains every
time.''
   While he never held any government job before joining Bush's
Cabinet, Mosbacher maintains that reaching a consensus in
government isn't all that different from the hard bargaining that
goes on in business.
   ``You have to sell your viewpoint when you are trying to get
somebody to buy your deal or when you are buying someone else's
deal,'' he said. ``I don't know any business in the world that is
more based on trading than the oil business.''
   But another reason for Mosbacher's rising star in government is
undoubtedly his tie to Bush _ a friendship that dates back 30 years
to the time both were starting out in the oil business in Houston.
   Mosbacher and Bush, both the offspring of wealthy Eastern
families, chose to seek their own fortunes in Texas. Mosbacher was
considerably more successful than Bush, amassing a net worth
estimated at more than $150 million, making him the wealthiest
member of the Bush Cabinet.
   Mosbacher raised a cool $25 million in large contributions as
Bush's chief campaign fundraiser last year.
   On a table in Mosbacher's ornate office is a photo of a
triumphant Bush, arms upraised, taken at the 1988 Republican
Convention. Scrawled across the picture is the message, ``Bob, What
a night! I'd never have made it here without you. Gratefully,
George.''
   Mosbacher, however, objects to any suggestion that he is playing
on his friendship to score bureaucratic victories.
   ``Being an old friend of the president's hasn't hurt, but I am
not sure, even if I wanted to, that it would affect his
decision-making to one degree,'' he said.
   Whatever the reason, Mosbacher's early gains have been a tonic
for the sprawling 40,000-employee department he heads. Composed of
a hodgepodge of agencies from the Census Bureau to the National
Weather Service, Commerce has rarely before been at the center of
policy debates.
   But the agency does have the responsibility of administering the
country's trade laws, not a small task in an era of
$100-billion-plus trade deficits.
   Those deficits, considered by many to be the biggest economic
failure of the Reagan years, have increased worries about America's
standing in the world and its ability to compete with trade
powerhouses such as Japan.
   Touching on those concerns in his speeches, Mosbacher portrays
the competitiveness issue in almost life and death terms:
   ``If this nation surrenders to complacency, if we lose control
of industries and production of products vital to our defense and
way of life, at stake is not just American jobs and prosperity, but
America's freedom.''
   But within the administration, there is an intense debate over
the proper role of government in assisting American businesses to
compete internationally.
   One view holds that anything that smacks of an industrial
policy, where government singles out certain industries for
assistance, is anathema to the Republican free-market views on
economic issues.
   But Mosbacher has been canpaigning for a much more activist
approach.
   He is careful not to define his proposal as an industrial
policy, but rather an ``industry-led business-government
partnership.''
   He has come out in favor of government support in the race to
develop high-definition television. He favors relaxation of
anti-trust laws to allow high-technology industries to join forces
to promote research and development. He would like to ease
government regulations to aid industry.
   Those views are far from universally held throughout the
Cabinet. Mosbacher was forced to defend them at the inaugural
meeting of the administration's new Council on Competitiveness.
   Mosbacher says he is undeterred, although he was unhappy that
reports of the internal disagreement found their way into print.
   News leaks, the time-honored way for opposing forces to sway
public opinion in Washington, leave Mosbacher ``horrified.''
   ``You go to a meeting with the president of the United States
and you come out and the next day you read about everything that
you said and everyone else said. If that were my company, I would
fire whoever did that,'' he said.
   One other difference that Mosbacher has found between government
service and the busines world is the working hours, which he termed
``long and hard, much longer than business.''
   Mosbacher's day starts before 8 a.m. and often runs late into
the night.
   ``Then you get a briefing book to read before the next
morning,'' he moans.
   But the grind hasn't kept him out of the Washington social
scene, where he and his third wife, Georgette, a former model, have
made quite a splash, hosting parties not only for Washington
powerbrokers but for New York friends such as the Donald Trumps.
   Mosbacher says he even kids his friend the president about
getting Potomac Fever and a lust for higher office, reminding Bush
of the painting of Herbert Hoover, a former commerce secretary,
prominently displayed over Mosbacher's office fireplace.
   ``I say, `You know, I look every day at that portrait of Herbert
Hoover and he went right from here to the presidency. How do you
feel about that?'''

<HEAD>Stones Rock Quietly in Sleepy Connecticut Town</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH LIGHTFOOT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rolling Stones may be known as the
bad boys of rock 'n' roll, but in this tiny pastoral town in
Connecticut's northwest corner, they've just been good, quiet
neighbors during their brief stay.
   No one seems to have seen the legendary, and historically
flamboyant, band members _ Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie
Watts, Ron Wood and Bill Wyman _ since they arrived with a
25-member entourage to prepare for their next tour.
   And no one, except for the few die-hard fans who line the
roadside by the Wykeham Rise School, a former girls' boarding
school rented by the Stones for six weeks as practice space, and
those who live right near it, seems to have heard them. For those
who did, it was only faint strains of guitar and drums and
indecipherable Jagger vocals.
   ``They're here to work, to get a tour together,'' said Fran
Cropley, manager at Dobber's Den, a local restaurant that would be
convenient if the Stones decide to eat out while in town. ``One of
the local ladies (who lives near the school) says she's heard more
noise when school's in session.''
   Resident State Trooper Rocky Tomlinson, who has been patroling
the grounds around Wykeham Rise, said the Stones have sound-proofed
the large dance studio they are using as their rehearsal space.
   ``They've taken care of the place so they're not disturbing
neighbors,'' he said. ``I know they don't want the town to be
disrupted.''
   Apparently the middle-age Stones, no longer the rabble-rousers
they once were, don't want to be disrupted, either.
   A private security force stands ready to evict any zealot who
wanders up cordoned-off driveways or through the woods to catch a
glimpse of the rockers or hear a few strains of music.
   While some members of the entourage are staying at the
Washington Inn, others are staying in private homes rented for the
six-week stay, which will end in mid-August. When they go on tour,
their first in eight years, they're guaranteed $65 million. They
open Sept. 1 at Rich Stadium near Buffalo, N.Y.
   Townspeople say the rock stars drive straight to the school for
practice, and so far there have been no reports of them mingling
locally, although Richards' wife, model Patti Hansen, had some film
developed at Parks Drug, a local hangout near Town Hall.
   George Auchincloss, an agent at the realty company that arranged
some of the housing rentals for the band, said the Stones probably
chose the area because it is known as a peaceful, private place
where artists have traditionally gone to get away.
   ``Authors and writers and interesting people have been here
forever _ it's always been a retreat-type area, a second home area,
going back to the old days,'' Auchincloss said. ``It's a quiet area
and people don't bother us.''
   Besides its famous residents this summer, Washington boasts
singer-songwriter James Taylor and designer Bill Blass among its
homeowners. Dustin Hoffman and Arthur Miller live in nearby
Roxbury. Meryl Streep lives down the road in Salisbury.
   Many celebrities send their children to boarding schools in the
area _ The Gunnery and Rumsey Hall and, until it had to close its
doors in June due to declining enrollment, Wykeham Rise.
   The 210-year-old town of Washington was named after the nation's
first president, who used to travel through the area and reputedly
once ate breakfast at a local tavern.
   Linn Tanzman, a spokeswoman for the band, said the Stones
considered a few other spots before settling on Washington for
their pre-tour rehearsal. She declined to state specific reasons
for choosing Washington, but said it had everything the band needed
in terms of practice space and living quarters.
   Nancy Shook, who works behind the soda fountain in The Green
store, and was wearing a pin depicting lips and a protruding tongue
from the Stone's ``Tattoo You'' album, said people come to
Washington when they want to be inconspicuous.
   ``People just come here because they know it's going to be nice
and quiet,'' she said. ``They aren't going to go screaming and
raging.''
   Sam Herrick, a 16-year-old student at The Gunnery, said the
Stones weren't really anything new.
   ``It's no big deal,'' he said. ``Dustin Hoffman and James Taylor
_ people have been up here. It's just another big guy.''
   There was some initial skepticism about the arrival of the
legendary rock group. Two entrepreneurial residents, Pierce Kearney
and Matt Stevens, even had T-shirts made, bearing the unfriendly
message ``Roll on Outa Here, Washington, CT, 1989.'' On the back of
the shirt is the infamous lips and tongue symbol, but with a bold,
red not-allowed slash through it.
   They decided to make the shirts, they said, ``because the Stones
are going out on a $65 million tour and we thought we'd get a
little piece of that.''
   In just a few days of selling the shirts out of his truck,
Kearney, a carpenter who has lived in Washington all his life, said
he's sold more than half of the 100 shirts he and Stevens had made,
for $15 each.
   Despite the high sales rate of the anti-Stones shirts, the
antagonism seems to have faded after about a week of the Stones'
quiet presence.
   ``As far as the town is concerned, the Stones haven't made much
difference,'' Auchincloss said. ``Nobody's seen them or heard
them.''
   Meanwhile, some residents are wishing they would hear something.
   Herrick, who said he wasn't fazed by the fact that Jagger and
company could stroll by the house he's painting at any time, had to
admit he'd be pretty excited if they decided to do an impromptu
concert.
   ``Sometimes they do gratuity concerts _ that would be awesome,''
he said. ``That would be great. My dad's really into the Stones and
stuff. He used to be a DJ and everything.
   ``The fact that they're here in town is no big deal, but if I
saw them,...'' he trailed off, wistfully.
   Cropley would like to offer a casual invitation to Mick and the
band to stop by Dobber's Den for dinner and a drink. ``It would be
nice to make a contact with them. I would like to invite them in to
have dinner in a very low-key way.''
   He'd thought of asking the group to do a benefit concert for the
victims of the tornado that roared through the state, including
parts of Litchfield County, two weeks ago. On second thought,
though, he said it might be more of a production than he and the
town could handle.
   ``Besides,'' he said, ``I respect their privacy.''

   Chairman Alan Greenspan said the Federal
Reserve has shifted its emphasis from fighting inflation to
avoiding a recession, a signal that the central bank likely will
continue to cautiously push down interest rates.
   ``Recent developments suggest that the balance of risks may have
shifted somewhat away from greater inflation,'' Greenspan told a

is an unnecessary and destructive recession.''

   Meeting deficit-reduction targets in fiscal

benefits would require a 10 percent across-the-board cut in federal
spending, the Congressional Budget Office said.
   The $74 billion to $88 billion in spending cuts needed to meet
the fiscal 1991 defict target of $64 billion without raising taxes
would likely force the economy into a recession unless the Federal
Reserve Board further loosens its reins on inflation substantially,
the House Budget Committee was told Thursday.

   Congress should not ban the controversial
practice of dual trading _ where brokers trade for themselves and

   Critics say dual trading allows brokers to take care of their
own needs first, but banning it outright ``would be dangerous,''

   The chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's oldest

   The crash of a United wide-bodied jet in Sioux
City, Iowa, demonstrates a problem already highlighted in two other
major DC-10 accidents: the lack of an effective backup when the
hydraulic system fails.
   Other incidents prior to Wednesday's DC-10 crash have a common
thread in the loss of pilot control after a failure that would not
ordinarily affect flight controls, such as loss of an engine or a
cargo door.
   Each has added to concern among government and aviation
authorities over design of the DC-10, which the government grounded

<HEAD>Pinch of Inflation Often Worse Than Statistics Indicate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government statistics indicate that inflation is
under control, but it does not always feel that way to Americans
who are paying more for everything from gasoline to doctor's bills.
   From Brooklyn to Idaho to Fayetteville, N.C., people say they
are feeling squeezed.
   On Capitol Hill, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
predicted Thursday that consumer prices would rise 5 percent to 5.5
percent this year, less than previously predicted.
   The inflation rate remains too high, but the Fed has prevented
prices from spiraling by keeping interest rates high, Greenspan
said.
   Twelve blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue at another Capitol Hill
establishment, Donald Turley said things did not seem so good to
him.
   ``I don't know who's writing the statistics up, but from my own
point of view, I can remember in the early '70s, middle '70s,
things seemed a lot easier,'' said Turley, an employee of Capitol
Hill Great Day Pet Parlor.
   ``It takes everything you have to go from payday to payday. You
don't have enough money to do the things you need to do, let alone
the things you want to do,'' Turley said.
   ``Things can't get any worse, but they always do.''
   Not everyone is feeling pinched, of course. The U.S. economy is
in the longest peacetime expansion on record. The June monthly
inflation of 0.2 percent was the lowest in 16 months, the Commerce
Department said Wednesday.
   ``I'm very happy with this Republican administration,'' said
another Capitol Hill figure, Sam Rowland, owner of Capitol Hill
Florist in Washington. ``When the Democrats are in there you starve
to death.''
   ``My general opinion I don't really feel inflation's all that
high,'' said Brad Rice, city manager of Rent All Minnesota in St.
Paul, Minn. His company _ which rents items ranging from
construction equipment to party supplies _ raised rental prices 5
percent in April.
   ``What has affected me the most is the cost of children's
clothing and shoes. They seem to go up every year,'' said Cherre
Wall, a secretary at Fleishman's Tiny Town childrens clothing store
in Fayetteville, N.C., who is married and has two boys, aged 12 and
15.
   ``The overall rate is more than we can keep up with sometimes,''
she said.
   Even the true bargains, like falling rates for long-distance
phone service, don't seem to impress consumers.
   Lori Mael, a clerk at the Diworshak hydroelectric dam in
Ahsahka, Idaho, said she doesn't make many long-distance calls
anyway. And Mrs. Wall, the North Carolina secretary, said she has
her doubts about the phone rate claims.
   ``They want you to think they're going down. I don't know if
they are or not.''
   Behavioral scientists say people's perceptions of inflation are
based almost entirely on personal experiences, not statistics.
   At Animal Hair Manufacturing Co. in Brooklyn, N.Y., the
perception of inflation is bad.
   The company _ on Beard Street _ cleans and processes raw
horsehair for use in brooms and brushes. It used to deal in white
horsehair for violin bows, but the price per pound has gone from $5
in the 1940s to $400 now.
   The company can't afford to compete with Europeans for supplies
of horsehair from South America because of the drop in the value of
the dollar, said the president, Walter Deligdish.
   ``For us to get it from Europe, it's just outrageous,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hotelier Plans to Develop 150 Retirement Communities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marriott Corp. has announced plans to develop
150 retirement communities over the next five years that it said
would offer housing to more than 25,000 older Americans and create
up to 18,000 new jobs.
   Marriott's Senior Living Services division already is operating
12 communities, three others are under development and it said four
more will be built in Silver Spring, Md.; Boca Raton, Fla.;
Glenview, Ill.; and Palos Verde, Calif, the company said.
   The planned rental communities announced Thursday are of two
types.
   Independent full-service facilities will feature apartments or
cottages for people who can function independently, or who want to
receive help with day-to-day activities such as dressing, grooming,
meals and housekeeping. Should they reach a point where they need
full-time care, they can move into the nursing home that is part of
the community.
   Catered-care communities are smaller facilities which feature
studio apartments for people who need regular assistance and which
also offer licensed nursing beds.
   ``These communities have been designed to not only take care of
life's necessities, but to encourage our residents to lead active
and vigorous lifestyles,'' said James Eden, vice president and
general manager for Marriott's Senior Living Services.
   Daniel Thursz, president of the National Council on the Aging,
said the facilities would help address the huge unmet need
nationally for affordable housing for senior citizens.
   ``America faces a critical and growing crisis in its ability to
provide both adequate housing and longterm healthcare for the
nation's every-growing older population,'' Thursz said.

   Farm-state senators have asked federal
regulators to investigate a recent emergency order by the Chicago
Board of Trade aimed at avoiding a squeeze in the soybean futures
market.
   The lawmakers on Thursday sought the review by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the futures markets, of
a soybean sell-off order issued last week by the CBOT.
   ``We are extremely concerned about the effects which recent
events have had on agricultural producers and small investors,''
the senators wrote in a letter to CFTC Chairwoman Wendy Gramm.
``Furthermore, these events raise important questions about whether
adequate safeguards are in place to prevent unwarranted emergency
actions.''
   The letter was written by Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., and
signed by several others, including Sens. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.;
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; and Robert Kerry, D-Neb. They serve on the
Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the futures markets
and the regulatory agency.
   The lawmakers asked the CFTC for a full disclosure of the events
during the last several months that led up to the emergency order,
including identification of all traders holding positions larger
than 1 million bushels of soybeans during May, June and July.
   The order by the board forced some traders to sell off part of
their holdings in July soybeans, and was viewed as an effort to
break an attempt by a foreign firm to corner the market.
   Soybean futures prices dropped sharply as a result of the order.
   Ferruzzi SpA, an Italian agricultural and financial firm,
reportedly had contracts to take delivery on 23 million bushels of
soybeans this month when there were only about 12 million bushels
in locations for easy delivery to meet those commitments. A move by
the grain trader to take delivery on its contracts could have
sharply increased soybean prices. Company officials have denied any
attempt to corner the market, however.
   Kate Hathaway, a spokesman for CFTC, said the agency has a
formal review of the board's order under way. Although she had not
seen a copy of the letter, she said some of the senators' questions
appeared to be addressed by the commission's review process.
   The commission has a policy of not publicly disclosing
information about individual traders, but Hathaway said the agency
has in the past privately sharedsome of that information with
members of Congress.
   Among other things, the senators asked for an assessment of the
current delivery system for commodity contracts and ``what actions
can be taken to prevent a similar situation with the August soybean
contract?''

<HEAD>Bush Adviser Denies Administration Is Inviting Tax-Increase Proposals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's chief economic adviser has
rejected a suggestion the administration is inviting tax-increase
proposals when it says it would consider such proposals on their
merits.
   Chairman Michael Boskin of the Council of Economic Advisers was
questioned several times Thursday at a congressional Joint Economic
Committee hearing about the president's ``no new taxes'' pledge
made during last year's campaign.
   Boskin replied that he fully supports Bush's position and that
the administration does not intend to bring the issue with Congress
when both sides begin negotiations on the fiscal budget for 1991.
Then he added:
   ``We will listen and consider any proposal on its merits.''
   That prompted Sen. William Roth, R-Del., a committee member who
has raised the tax-increase question at several recent
congressional hearings, to remark:
   ``When you say you would consider a proposal, that almost
invites one.''
   Boskin denied the administration was inviting anyone to bring up
the issue.
   ``We are reasonable people,'' he said. ``We will listen, but we
don't think we need a tax increase and we don't think one is
desirable.''
   Committee Chairman Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind., suggested the
willingness to consider tax proposals ``appears to be a shift from
a very hard line position (of) `no new taxes' to a position of
we'll sit at the table and consider proposals.''
   Boskin replied the administration does not mean to suggest it is
weakening its position.
   Hamilton also asked Boskin whether the ``no new tax'' position
applies throughout Bush's first term.
   ``So far as I know, that is the president's desire,'' Boskin
replied.
   In an appearance before the committee on Wednesday, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas H. Brady also repeated the administration's
intent oppose new taxes in the new budget talks.
   But, despite prodding by Roth, he declined to categorically rule
out the possibility of a tax increase.
   ``Certainly the 1990 budget was put together with that in mind
and that's what happened,'' Brady said. ``We would begin with that
same process in 1991. The president's position is quite clear and
that obviously is my position.''

<HEAD>Institutions Taken Over In Six States</HEAD>

   Federal regulators have seized control of
seven more savings and loan institutions in preparation for
congressional passage of President Bush's S&amp;L bailout.
   Thursday's action, which does not affect depositors, brings the
number of failed S&amp;Ls under government management to 244 in 33
states.
   The institutions in the latest batch are in California, Florida,
Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico and Tennessee.
   They are:
   _Sierra Federal Savings and Loan Association, Beverly Hills,
Calif., with $49 million in assets.
   _American Interstate Savings, Los Angeles, with $27 million in
assets.
   _Commonwealth Savings and Loan Association of Florida, Margate,
Fla., with $1.68 billion in assets.
   _Peoples Bank for Savings, Streator, Ill., with $53 million in
assets.
   _Parrish Federal Savings Bank, Denham Springs, La., with $15
million in assets.
   _New Mexico Federal Savings and Loan Association, Albuquerque,
N.M., with $253 million in assets.
   _Home Federal Savings and Loan Association, Memphis, Tenn., with
$218 million in assets.
   All seven institutions will be managed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which insures commercial banks and under proposed
bailout legislation would get new authority over the S&amp;L agency.
   The goal of the takeover program is to minimize losses and limit
risk until Congress provides the money to close the institutions or
subsidize their sale to new owners.
   Negotiators from the House and Senate are working to present
President Bush with a finished bill before Congress leaves for its
August vacation.

<UNK>EEC Opens Talks on Trade Pact with Soviet Union</UNK>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community says it
had opened talks with the Soviet Union on a trade and economic
cooperation agreement.
   The two sides discussed trade, investment and economic
cooperation, the EEC's executive commission said Thursday. A
further round of talks is expected in early October.
   Frans Andriessen, EEC commissioner for External Relations, said
in June the 12-nation trade bloc wanted to conclude a 10-year
agreement, which would not offer any trade concessions to the
Soviet Union, but would include ``most favored nation'' treatment
under international trade rules.
   The accord also would offer management training and joint
ventures as well as cooperation on the environment, energy and
nuclear safety.
   The EEC had a trade deficit of $2.9 billion with the Soviet
Union in 1988. The EEC imports mainly natural gas and petroleum
products from the Soviet Union while it exports mainly manufactured
products and machinery.
   The EEC has signed trade and cooperation agreements with
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, is close to signing a pact with Poland,
and has opened negotiations with East Germany.

<HEAD>Planned Alcohol Fuel Plant Designed To Prosper From Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The developer of an $85 million alcohol
fuel plant in eastern West Virginia says the idea to convert waste
products into alcohol isn't revolutionary _ he's just built a
better mousetrap.
   The plant, to be built on 300 acres in Hampshire County, is
designed to produce ethanol from recycled paper and wood products.
Construction is slated to begin within two months and the plant is
scheduled to be operating by early 1991.
   ``We just take anything that has cellulose in it and break it
down,'' said Richard Wells, the head of KR Biochem in Tulsa, Okla.
``You break it down to a sugar component and then you can ferment
sugar into any kind of product you want.''
   Wells declined to reveal the specific process that will be used
to produce the alcohol.
   One alcohol fuels expert was skeptical about Wells' plans.
   ``I'm actually surprised they're putting in a plant unless
they've found some new process,'' said Doug Gardner, assistant
professor of wood science at West Virginia University. He said he
didn't know the process KR Biochem would use, but that the cost of
oil usually determines whether an alternative fuels project will be
successful.
   ``We had the energy crisis and the price of oil got expensive,''
prompting several alternative fuel development projects, Gardner
said. ``Then the oil price dropped.
   ``These processes generally are more expensive (than oil), so
the fuel isn't worth doing. If the price of fuel goes up, then
these processes might be economically feasible.''
   Wells said the key to his plans is the raw products his plant
will use.
   ``You must remember we're using waste materials,'' he said. ``If
you use waste materials you normally don't pay much for them except
maybe cost of freight. With the feedstock nearly free it makes it
cost-effective.
   ``That's one of the drawbacks to using ethanol right now is
(producers) use grain and it's very expensive. As a result, it's
difficult for ethanol producers to compete with crude oil that's so
cheap.
   ``If we use ... waste then we can compete with crude oil no
matter what the price.''
   The scrap paper used would come primarily from the East Coast.
The operation also would use sawdust from West Virginia lumber
companies.
   Wells said he chose West Virginia for a variety of reasons,
including the state's pledge to provide federal employee training
money and its central location.
   Gardner said the cellulose found in wood and paper is formed
from glucose molecules. The glucose, or sugar, can be fermented and
turned into alcohol.
   Wells, whose said his company has 25 years of experience
building gas and oil facilities, said the Tennessee Valley
Authority researched the process and last week conducted a
demonstration.
   ``They just proved that what we're doing works,'' he said,
adding that the TVA will act as a consultant to KR Biochem.
   The plant, which is to employ 100 workers to start and up to
2,000 in four to six years, would be capable of producing 32
million gallons of ethanol a year, he said.
   Wells said there is a strong national market for ethanol, which
is used to enhance the octane in gasoline.
   But, he said, ``Its real benefit is it's a total substitute for
gasoline. It doesn't have the pollution of gasoline and under
President Bush's alternative fuels legislation, it calls for
replacing gasoline with ethanol.''
   Bush's proposal is to have 1 million alternative-fuel vehicles
on the road by 1995.
   ``Alcohol is big business already,'' Wells said. ``It takes
about two barrels of oil to equal one barrel of fuel-grade
alcohol.''
   Several projects to produce ethanol-powered cars, such as in
Brazil, have been scrapped over the years because of the fuel's
cost. But Wells is confident he can produce the ethanol more
cheaply.
   Wells also said, however, that his plant wouldn't be limited to
producing alcohol.
   ``There are probably over 50 products that can be made from this
plant ... with minor changes,'' he said. ``Ethanol is just one of
them.''

<HEAD>Exchange Official Details Different Version of Soybean Emergency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade's efforts to erase
doubts about why it took emergency action in the soybean futures
market last week has raised even more questions about federal
regulators' actions.
   CBOT Chairman Karsten Mahlman testified before a House
subcommittee Thursday that the exchange ordered the liquidation of
large positions in the July soybean futures market last week after
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ``took their own
independent action.''
   That statement was ``inconsistent'' with previous statements by
the CFTC Chairwoman Wendy Gramm, noted subcommittee members.
   Earlier this week, Ms. Gramm, whose agency is up for
reauthorization by Congress, testified that the CFTC only consulted
with the Chicago exchange about the emergency order and was now
reviewing it.
   But Mahlman said Ms. Gramm's agency, ``independent of the
exchange's action,'' also determined that ``one major market
participant'' wasn't meeting its obligation to liquidate futures
contracts in an orderly manner.
   ``We were led to believe that the situation took place
differently,'' said Rep. David R. Nagle, D-Iowa.
   Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods,
such as soybeans or gold, at a specified price at a specified time
in the future. Most futures traders never take or make delivery;
They enter into futures investments planning to close out their
positions before delivery date.
   Liquidation is the sale of futures contracts to offset an
obligation to take delivery of an equal number of futures contracts
purchased earlier for the same month.
   Mahlman would not identify the ``major market participant'' at
which the order was directed, but the action was widely perceived
as a move to prevent Italian grain merchant Ferruzzi Finanziaria
SpA from squeezing or cornering the soybean market, a charge
Ferruzzi denies.
   ``There was a real threat of potential default on the contract,
which would have had long-term damaging effects on the soybean
futures market,'' said Mahlman in a statement issued in Washington
and Chicago.
   He also said the CBOT was aware that one entity was acquiring a
large position in soybean futures because it had been granted an
exemption by the CFTC.
   Outside the hearing room, Mahlman would not comment on whether
the exemption was a good idea.
   ``We hope our strong action in July will not be necessary in
August,'' Mahlman told reporters. ``I think we have dramatically
enhanced the credibility of the board.''
   In earlier testimony, the head of another Chicago exchange, the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said Congress should not ban the
controversial practice of dual trading, in which brokers trade for
themselves and their customers. The statement represented a
reversal of the Merc's earlier position.
   Critics say dual trading allows brokers to take care of their
own needs first, but banning it outright ``would be dangerous,''
said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive committee.
   Mahlman concurred with that position. In a statement submitted
to the subcommittee, Mahlman, chairman of the world's oldest and
largest futures exchange, said a ban on dual trading ``will
adversely affect the liquidity of futures markets, particularly
agricultural markets, by increasing the cost of doing business.''
   Ms. Gramm exasperated committee members Tuesday with her
cautious answers to questions about the agency's consulting role in
the Chicago soybean situation.
   Ms. Gramm, who also said more study was needed before dual
trading was banned, said her agency was reviewing the CBOT's
emergency order but neither directly approved nor disapproved of
the action.
   Subcommittee Chairman Glenn English, D-Okla., alluded to his
frustration with the CFTC at the start of the Thursday session when
he said the congressmen present ``want to get complete answers
instead of the ones they got Tuesday.''
   The dual-trading bill, sponsored by English and the
subcommittee's ranking Republican, E. Thomas Coleman of Missouri,
would allow the practice only in certain circumstances, including
futures issues that have an average daily trading volume of fewer
than 7,000 contracts.
   But Melamed, the Chicago Merc official, said dual trading was
needed to maintain liquidity when there are few customer orders. He
added that pegging dual trading permissibility to volume ignores
the monthly idiosyncracies of various markets such as soybeans,
cattle, oil or gold.
   But Robert D. Josserand, president of the National Cattlemen's
Association, advocated the elimination of dual trading to restore
public confidence.

   A Delaware judge has reserved decision on a
request by Chris-Craft Industries Inc. for more time to consider
how it will dispose of its stock in Warner Communications Inc.
under Warner's merger agreement with Time Inc.
   Chris-Craft, a major Warner stockholder, and its subsidiary BHC
Inc., have until July 30 to decide what to do with the stock.
Chris-Craft and BHC have several options involving the stock under
a May 19 agreement with Warner.
   The companies told Chancery Court Judge Jack Jacobs in
Wilmington on Thursday that they needed more time to decide what to
do because Time and Warner amended their original stock-swap merger
plan to provide for Time's pending $14 billion tender for Warner.
   Chris-Craft and BHC also have filed suit in New York in
connection with their Warner stock, trying to preserve their rights
under the tender offer for Warner.
   The Chris-Craft suits are a side issue in the court battle
emanating from the Time-Warner deal. The Delaware Supreme Court is
to hear arguments Monday on Paramount Communications Inc.'s appeal
of a lower court ruling allowing Time to proceed with its
$70-a-share tender offer for Warner.
   Paramount, which is trying to buy Time for $200 a share or $12.2
billion, says its offer would be precluded by the Time-Warner
merger.
   On Wall Street on Thursday, traders continued to square their
positions in advance of Monday's hearing. Investors and legal
scholars generally believe Paramount will lose before the Supreme
Court and give up its bid.
   Time stock fell 75 cents to $138.62{ a share in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, while Warner was unchanged at $65.62{ a
share and Paramount fell 62{ cents to $58 a share.

   The dollar waned while gold gained today in
European trading.
   Metal traders in London said buyers had responded to the
softening of the dollar.
   The currency market wavered amid confused reaction to Thursday's
statements by Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan.
   ``Recent developments suggest that the balance of risks may have
shifted somewhat away from greater inflation,'' Greenspan told a
Congressional committee in Washington. `` ... What we seek to avoid
is an unnecessary and destructive recession.''
   In Frankfurt, the dollar had moved as high as 1.9040 marks early
in the morning, but retreated to 1.8955 marks later before
rebounding to 1.8975 marks.
   One trader at a major U.S. bank in Frankfurt predicted the
dollar would stay in a range between 1.8950 marks and 1.9150 marks.
   The dollar closed slightly lower in Tokyo Friday at 142.15 yen,
a drop of 0.08 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London, the
dollar slid to 141.60 yen.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6275 this morning, up for
buyers from Thursday's late $1.6273.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Thursday's late rates, included: 1.6360 Swiss francs, down from

   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $370.75 a troy ounce,
down from $372.45 late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers set a recommended price of $372.25 per troy
ounce.
   In Zurich, gold traded at $372.90, down from $371.75 bid at the

<HEAD>CBOT, For First Time, Links Soybean Order to Ferruzzi</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade has, for the first
time, linked Italian grain merchant Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. to
the exchange's order requiring traders to reduce their holdings in
soybean futures contracts.
   In a statement to exchange members issued Thursday, after the
expiration of the July soybean contract, the world's largest
commodity exchange said it took the emergency action after a
Ferruzzi subsidiary failed to voluntarily reduce its large holdings
in the July soybean market.
   In the statement, the exchange said its business conduct
committee had met with Ferruzzi USA Inc. of Belle Chasse, La., in
early July and asked it to voluntarily reduce its market position
to ensure the orderly expiration of the July contract.
   ``Subsequent to that meeting, Ferruzzi failed to reduce its
position,'' the exchange said in the statement. ``As a result, the
businesss conduct committee recommended to the board of directors
that the board exercise its emergency authority to ensure the
orderly liquidation of the July soybean contract.''
   The resulting July 11 order requiring traders to reduce their
positions in the July soybean market to 1 million bushels, was
widely perceived as a move to prevent Ferruzzi from squeezing or
cornering the soybean market, a charge Ferruzzi denies.
   Ferruzzi at the time the order was issued held futures contracts
representing 23 million bushels of soybeans.
   A CBOT spokesman said Thursday that the exchange took the
emergency action to ensure that obligations to deliver soybeans did
not exceed the supply of soybeans meeting the contract's
specifications.
   The Board of Trade has been heavily criticized by farm groups
and traders who saw the value of their futures holdings drop when
soybean futures prices fell sharply on the day after the exchange
issued the directive.
   The contract for July delivery of soybeans expired on a weak
note Thursday, bringing an end to trading in the contract but not
to the controversy surrounding it.
   The July soybean contract expired at 12:01 p.m. CDT at $6.88{ a
bushel, down 39 cents from Wednesday's settlement price. That final
price is 37{ cents per bushel below the price on July 1, when the
CBOT directors issued the emergency order.
   The emergency order ``had to be a great influence on the drop in
prices,'' said grain trader Bud Frazier, executive vice president
of Balfour, Maclaine.
   Some observers said the same pressures that had prompted the
exchange to limit holdings in July soybean futures may be building
again in the August contract.
   Ferruzzi has said it was complying with the exchange's directive
but traders familiar with the firm's methods said the company may
have rolled its huge position out of the July contract and into the
August contract, potentially setting up another confrontation with
the Board of Trade next month.
   ``I have no way of proving it but a lot of people think that's
what they're doing,'' said a trader who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann alluded to the
possibility at a news conference in Washington, where he was
testifying before a congressional committee.
   ``We hope that our strong action will not be necessary in
August,'' Mahlmann said.
   Ferruzzi did not return calls inquiring about its market
position. But the company released a statement saying it supports
full disclosure of events that led to the Board of Trade's
emergency action.
   Board of Trade spokesmen would not comment on Ferruzzi's market
position or on trader response to the emergency order.
   ``If open interest is in line with deliverable supplies, that is
the idea,'' said exchange spokesman Michael O'Connell.
   O'Connell said updated figures on July open interest and
deliverable supplies of soybeans would be available today.

<HEAD>Egghead Shareholders Accuse Software Retailer of Securities Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A class-action lawsuit has been filed by
shareholders against Egghead Discount Software, accusing the
nation's largest-volume personal computer software retailer and its
principal officers of securities fraud.
   The lawsuit, disclosed Thursday by Egghead, follows nearly $13
million in unexpected losses last quarter despite a 50 percent
increase in Egghead's sales.
   Egghead, which has denied the allegations, has blamed much of
the loss on ``shrinkage'' or missing inventory, and on poor
accounting systems.
   The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, was filed in U.S.
District Court in Seattle and alleges that the plaintiff, Egghead
stockholder Steve Goldman, and others were damaged as a result of
alleged misstatements in connection with the company's initial
public stock offering and its public statements and filings from
June 6, 1988, through April 24, 1989.
   ``The main claim is the same claim that you get in any
securities fraud cases,'' said Steve Berman, an attorney
representing shareholders.
   ``We are alleging that Egghead and its directors failed to
disclose material facts about the company's financial and
competitive condition at the time they offered the stock and
throughout the class period,'' he said.
   Egghead denied the allegations.
   ``We have reviewed the plaintiff's claims and believe they are
entirely without merit,'' said Stuart Sloan, Egghead president and
chief executive officer. ``Egghead intends to defend this caes

<HEAD>Northwest Pilots Decide Not To Try To Buy Into Carrier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union pilots at Northwest Airlines
have decided they won't try to buy into the carrier, at least not
until after new owners take over.
   Union members decided Thursday it is too late to arrange an
equity investment, with a buyout of the Eagan-based airline at hand
by a group led by Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi and with the
pilots' labor contract still locked in a stand-off with management.
   ``Whether or not we should have proceeded with a different
strategy a year and-a-half ago is a moot point,'' said Pete
Quortrup, a spokesman for the pilots. Some 180 members at the
five-hour meeting seemed to accept that idea.
   The long-smoldering issue has divided the ranks of the Air Line
Pilots Association in recent months. Some of its 2,800 members have
insisted the union should hold a stake in the carrier being taken
over by Checchi's Wings Holdings.
   In a tender offer that expires at midnight tonight, the group
would pay $121 a share or about $3.65 billion for the airline.
   Checchi has said his group will entertain an employee
investment, but only after his buyout is complete.
   Still, frustrated advocates of an employee stock ownership plan
mailed flyers in recent weeks to 5,000 pilots at Northwest,
including a separate group of 2,200 former Republic Airlines
pilots. That group has divorced itself from the investment idea.
   ``I would much prefer to govern my own destiny as to have
someone else govern it for me,'' said Tom Beedem, a DC-10 pilot and
former chairman of the Northwest pilots Master Executive Council.
   Beedem said before the meeting he was among those urging members
to promote an employee ownership plan before settling their labor
contract with Northwest. He also said such an agreement should be
in place before a labor contract is signed.
   With the ranks alerted, advocates pitched their idea Thursday at
a Bloomington hotel, but the notion eventually was dropped without
a vote.
   Later, Quortrup said, Master Executive Council chairman Pete
Dodge recounted the history of pilot efforts to buy into Northwest,
including unsuccessfully exploring the prospect last summer.
   Both arguments were received ``thoughtfully,'' Dodge said, but
the idea was abandoned for now because ``you can't change a
strategy at this point. The company is not going to be a public
company that much longer.''
   The debate was emotional for some, said Quortrup, because
ownership appeals to pilots in a period of change and uncertainty.
   The pilots also were briefed at midday by their labor contract
negotiators, who spent the rest of the day at the bargaining table.
After 28 months, the two sides are still at odds over basic issues
such as wages.

   The senior Republican on the House Banking
Committee is proposing a compromise intended to break a deadlock
over how to fund President Bush's proposed savings and loan bailout.
   The dispute between the House and the Senate is the most
significant hurdle to be overcome if Congress is to send savings
and loan legislation to the president's desk before leaving for its
August vacation.
   The Senate, in its bill adopted in April, favored the
administration's financing plan, which would create a new,
quasi-private agency to borrow $50 billion in S&amp;L rescue costs.
That mechanism would keep the spending from ballooning the federal
budget deficit.
   The House, in its plan passed last month, would include the $50
billion in the budget deficit in what Democrats say is more honest
accounting. The plan would be slightly cheaper than the
administration's because S&amp;L funds would be borrowed directly
through the federal government.
   Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the senior Republican on the House
Banking Committee, said Thursday that under his plan, the first $25
billion in S&amp;L spending be borrowed this year and next. The
remaining $25 billion would go ``on-budget'' in 1991.
   By that time, the government would be selling enough property
from failed S&amp;Ls to partly offset the spending strain, he said.
   He conceded the scheme would put great strain on the ability of
the administration and Congress to reach agreement on the federal
budget as the 1992 elections approach.
   Wylie said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's ``visceral
reaction was not very favorable.'' But, he said that Brady
nevertheless planned to raise the proposal when House and Senate
conferees next meet publicly on Tuesday. The staffs of the two
chambers have been working behind closed doors trying to resolve
most differences in preparation for the session.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, and Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, were informed of the proposal but have so
far been noncommittal, Wylie said.
   Meanwhile, a House aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said a tentative agreement has been reached that would give the
Bush administration the authority it sought in disposing of an
estimated $300 billion in real estate and other property from
failed S&amp;Ls.
   The House has dropped its demand that L. William Seidman,
chairman of the politically independent Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., have a nonvoting seat on a five-member board overseeing
disposal of S&amp;L assets.
   Seidman still will be in charge of the day-to-day operations of
the Resolution Trust Corp., the new agency being created to handle
the property.
   But the policymaking responsibility for it will rest with the
board, chaired by Brady. Other members will be Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, Housing and Urban Development Secretary
Jack Kemp and two private citizens with background in real estate
or finance.

<HEAD>Investors Warm To Environment Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The environmental movement is attracting new
followers these days from what some people might consider an
unlikely place _ Wall Street.
   Since it began to gather momentum more than two decades ago, the
drive for cleaner air, land and water around the world often has
seemed at odds with the cause of economic expansion.
   Now, in at least one noteworthy case, the interests of the two
camps appear to be converging. If a good many stock market analysts
are right, the business of environmental cleanup and pollution
control is shaping up as a growth industry, in its own right, for
the 1990s.
   For evidence of that you need look no further than the stock
market, where shares of companies such as Waste Management Inc. and
Browning-Ferris Industries, the nation's two largest wate-disposal
concerns, climbed last week to record highs.
   Waste Management, at around $58, was up more than $6 from where
it stood at the end of June and had more than doubled in price
since late 1987.
   Browning-Ferris, which climbed to near $39 from $33.25 at
midyear, also traded at double its levels of less than two years
ago.
   Brokers said demand for those issues was swollen by buy orders
from organizers of a new investment company that was assembling a
portfolio of stocks in the environmental-services business.
   But there were other driving forces as well. When leaders of the
seven major industrialized nations issued a communique at the end
of their economic summit meeting in Paris earlier this month, they
devoted one-third of the document to environmental issues.
   William Reilly, administrator of the federal Environmental
Protection Agency, called that ``a major milestone.''
   In the United States, President Bush also has proposed
intensified measures to deal with such problems as acid rain.
   While there is no mistaking the momentum it has gathered,
however, analysts say investors who want to ride the environmental
wave face some significant hazards and uncertainties.
   For one thing, stock-market participants began to discern the
investment potential of environmental-services stocks a long time
ago.
   The Dow Jones index of five pollution control and waste
management stocks has more than sextupled since June 30, 1982,
ranking near the top of the more than 80 industry groups tracked by
the company over that span. For established companies in the field
the time for ``getting in on the ground floor'' appears long past.
   In addition, when a company encounters unexpected costs or other
problems in some environmental-services activity, the past record
suggests that its stock is likely to react harshly to any resulting
earnings disappointment.
   ``Even as new waste management crises, whether they be in
medical waste, nuclear waste or air pollution, seize investors'
attention, the surest profits remain in the solid-waste field,''
says the Value Line Investment Survey in its latest quarterly
apppraisal of the industrial services industry.
   ``Solid-waste handling is an established industry, within which
larger players can excel by adding technological refinement and
managerial finesse to established operating procedures.''
   By comparison, the investment advisory service says, ``the
cleanup of hazardous wastes often poses problems unique to
individual sites and requires the development of new
methodologies.''
   Whatever the potential pitfalls, the search has begun in earnest
for companies and industries that might benefit from changes
wrought by environmental concerns.
   If the idea once was ``big business vs. the environment,'' it is
now ``the environment as big business.''

   Stock prices were widely mixed today in the
aftermath of Thursday's late selloff.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.85 to 2,578.34 in
the first half hour of trading.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 314 up, 638
down and 505 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.18 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   In early trading on Thursday the market climbed to new highs for
the strong rally that dates back to mid-November of last year.
   But those gains failed to stand up to the pressure of afternoon
selling attributed partly to computer-program activity by
professionals closing out positions in options and stock-index
futures due to expire after the close today.
   Analysts said that reversal served to dampen some of the
enthusiasm stirred up by the market's impressive advance of late.
   Bankamerica rose | to 29[. On Thursday the company reported a
larger increase in second-quarter earnings than analysts had been
expecting.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .02 to 186.13. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .86 at 370.33.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average closed with an 8.92
loss at 2,575.49.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 641 up, 861 down and 481 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 204.59 million shares, against 215.74

<HEAD>Chicago Merc Reverses Position on Dual Trading</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-CFTC Hearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange says it has
reversed an earlier proposal to ban dual trading in most of its
markets.
   In a letter to its members, the exchange Thursday said
across-the-board restrictions on the practice would be ``a serious
mistake'' and that the practice should be allowed as long as
surveillance measures are adequate to detect abuse.
   Dual trading is the longstanding practice among floor brokers at
futures exchanges of trading for their own accounts and their
customers.
   The practice came under fire after the disclosure in January of
a federal investigation of suspected trading fraud at the Chicago
Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's two largest
futures exchanges.
   Critics say dual trading presents opportunities for floor
brokers to put their own interests ahead of their customers' by
trading for their own accounts ahead of large customer orders that
they know will move the market.
   A blue-ribbon committee appointed by the Merc to investigate
trading practices proposed on April 19 that the exchange do away
with dual trading in all markets except those where it is needed to
maintain market liquidity.
   But after reviewing the proposal, the exchange's internal
committee on dual trading recommended that the practice be allowed
in any market in which federal regulators determine that the
exchange's computerized trade-reconstruction system produces an
audit trail that is verifiably accurate to the nearest minute 90
percent of the time.

<TEXT>
   Entrepreneur George A. Koopman, whose
business ventures ranged from making special effects for the hit
movie ``The Blues Brothers'' to co-founding a commercial rocket
company, died in a car accident. He was 45.
   The Malibu resident, who wanted his American Rocket Co. to carry
small commercial payloads into sub-orbital space, was pronounced
dead Wednesday morning after his car struck a dirt embankment and
flipped over.
   He was on his way to Edwards Air Force Base to watch a test of a
rocket engine, said Jim Bennett, co-founder of the company.
   The Camarillo, Calif., company had scheduled its first launch
next month. The rockets are designed to go into space, but not into
orbit.
   The California Highway Patrol said Koopman's car was going the
wrong way on a one-way street.
   Before helping found American Rocket in 1985, Koopman was
involved in a variety of enterprises, including producing the
special effects for ``The Blues Brothers,'' the 1980 movie starring
Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. He also headed a small defense
contracting company at one time.

<HEAD>ABC and NABET Negotiators Reach Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. says it has reached a
tentative agreement with negotiators for its technicians union on a
four-year contract.
   The deal was reached Thursday after the union offered to
compromise on issues relating to job security, the company said.
The two sides have been negotiating for five months and an earlier
proposal was rejected in May.
   Negotiators for the union, the National Association of Broadcast
Employees and Technicians, said they would submit the contract to a
vote without taking a position on it.
   The union's members _ 2,700 according to the union, 2,150
according to the company _ will vote by August 11. The engineers,
at 1,850, make up the largest unit withnin the union.
   ``The union came to us and offered a very constructive and
workable approach and this resulted in the agreement today,'' said
Patricia Matson, a spokeswoman for Cap Cities-ABC.
   The company told its employees in a letter that, ``The
compromise became possible earlier this week when the union
suggested to the company that the company's four-year job guarantee
to NABET was less significant to the union than the issue of
separate seniority.''
   The company had offered to make the job guarantee four years
instead of three, but John Krieger, a spokesman for the National
Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, said it came
with so many escape clauses that it was ``like a Swiss cheese full
of holes.''
   The company withdrew the job-guarantee proposal and substituted
the seniority list compromise.
   The new rules call for employees on local and network television
seniority lists who were hired before Thursday to have a higher
priority than those hired after Thursday, who will be put on a new,
separate seniority list.
   That new list will determine who was last hired should layoffs
occur.
   A separate seniority list for radio employees will be maintained
as the company originally proposed.
   In addition, the company gave NABET assurances it would retain
some radio engineers to perform work no longer subject to NABET
jurisdiction.
   ``It's a compromise that they won't throw people out wholesale
and hire new people,'' Krieger said.
   He said 80 jobs had been at stake until the compromise and now
the union was willing to take a chance that the compromise will
work, Krieger said.
   The proposal to be voted upon calls for a signing bonus of 10
percent for the first year and pay increases of 3 percent in the
second and third years and 4 percent in the fourth year. The
original plan called for a 5 percent lump-sum bonus in the fourth
year.
   NABET also represents publicists, wardrobe people and
newswriters in certain cities, among other workers.

<HEAD>At Last, Municipal Bond Investors May Come Out of The Dark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Municipal bond investors finally may be coming
out from the dark.
   Unlike buyers of corporate and Treasury bonds, municipal bond
buyers have no central place to turn to find out current trading
prices of their investments.
   Newspapers rarely print lists of municipal bond prices, and
those lists that are available contain only a fraction of the 1
million or more muni bond issues outstanding.
   Municipal bond investors also don't benefit from the disclosure
rules that apply to corporate bond issuers. These rules require
release of detailed financial and background information so that
corporate bond buyers can make an informed investment.
   But several efforts under way could change all that.
   Late last month the Securities and Exchange Commission approved
the first formal disclosure rules for municipal bonds. The rules
grew out of the agency's five-year investigation of the $2.25
billion bond default by the Washington Public Power Supply System _
the largest bond default in municipal bond history.
   The new rules, effective Jan. 1, will require brokerages
underwriting municipal bond issues exceeding $1 million in value to
obtain extensive information about the projects being financed, the
government agencies issuing the bonds and any foreseeable risks.
   The bond underwriters then must release this information to all
potential buyers in the form of official statements during a
certain time period after the bonds are issued.
   The SEC rules also encourage the development of a central
repository that would hold and distribute bond disclosure
information. That would make it easier for municipal bond investors
to research before they buy.
   On another front, a trade group is studying the feasibility of
devising a system to make municipal bond price information readily
available to retail buyers, possibly through a computer network
similar to the one used for over-the-counter stocks.
   ``When investors in the $760 billion municipal bond market want
to know what their bonds are worth, they probably won't find them
listed in the local newspaper,'' the Public Securities Association
said in announcing a task force to study a pricing system.
   Instead, investors must call their brokers, who may or may not
have the information at their fingertips, said the PSA, which
represents banks, dealers and brokers that underwrite and sell
municipal and U.S. government bonds.
   But establishing a system to provide trading prices won't be
easy, in part due to the vast number of muni bonds, said PSA
President Heather L. Ruth.
   Another problem, she said, is that many of the smaller bond
issues, such as those from regional school districts or small-town
sewer authorities, are not actively traded. That means it would be
hard to establish a trading price if the bonds rarely change hands.
   Because of this, any pricing system most likely would be limited
to the most actively traded bonds, Ms. Ruth said. It also may rely
on indexes of similar kinds of bonds to show representative prices
rather than prices of individual issues, she added.
   Ms. Ruth said that despite the absence of disclosure
requirements, most of the larger municipal bond issuers, such as
state governments, have provided detailed background information
for years.
   She said the near-default by the city of New York on billions of
dollars worth of bonds in the mid-1970s was the catalyst for this
practice.
   Before the crisis, municipal bond issuers typically prepared
only a one- or two-page statement describing new bond offerings,
``which was really a sales document,'' Ms. Ruth said.
   But New York's fiscal problems left a bad taste in the mouths of
municipal bond investors, prompting the major issuers to provide
detailed reports on new issues, she said. The effect of the SEC
rules will be to spread this practice throughout the muni bond
market, she added.
   Municipal bonds were exempted from disclosure requirements when
the SEC was established in 1934. However, they were not exempted
from the anti-fraud regulations of the SEC statute, which bar bond
dealers from providing misleading information to customers.
   Muni bonds were left out of the disclosure requirements for
several reasons, Ms. Ruth said.
   For one, she said, ``The default rate on municipal securities
has always been extraordinarily low as compared with corporate
securities.''
   Another reason was concern that Congress would be overstepping
its bounds if it regulated how state and local goverments raise
funds, she said. In addition, most municipal bonds were owned by
institutional investors, who were thought to be savvy about the
risks.
   But the New York City crisis and the subsequent WPPSS default
changed all that.

   Federal regulators today rescued the last of the
big problem banks in the state, pledging $250 million to National
Bancshares Corp. of Texas less than 24 hours after bailing out
Texas American Bancshares Inc. with $900 million.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Equimark Corp. of
Pittsburgh will take over the San Antonio-based holding company,
which owns 12 banks with assets of $2.3 billion and deposits of
$2.2 billion.
   James H. McLaughlin, president of Equibank, which has $3.7
billion in assets, will become National Bancshares' chief executive.
   Equimark is contributing $31 million to the National Banchshares
transaction and, with its wholly-owned subsidiary, EquiManagement
Inc., will own about 44 percent of National Bancshares' stock.
Another $86 million is being raised from other investors through
private placements of preferred and common stock.
   National Bancshares' existing stockholders will retain a 2
percent stake in the rescued bank.
   Late Thursday, the FDIC committed $900 million to Deposit
Guaranty Bank of Dallas, which is taking over 24 subsidiary banks
owned by Texas American, headquartered in Fort Worth.
   In preparation for the sale of Texas American, the FDIC closed
its subsidiary banks Thursday and established an interim
institution.
   The bridge bank, to be managed under contract by Deposit
Guaranty, has total assets of approximately $4.2 billion and
deposits of approximately $4.1 billion. Deposit Guaranty, a $600
million, privately-owned company, will contribute approximately
$175 million Texas American.
   The transaction was the first time the FDIC awarded a large
failed Texas bank to another Texas bank.
   ``Obviously we're excited,'' said Deposit Guaranty Chairman
Robert Steinhart. ``We have a unique opportunity here. ... We see
an opportunity for a Texas-based bank and Texas-managed bank.''
   But Texas American objected to the planned arrangements, saying
it intended to file lawsuits against the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency and the FDIC.
   ``Texas American Bancshares is greatly disappointed in the
actions taken by these agencies and feels the company has been
dealt with unfairly,'' the company said in a statement.
   With the resolution of the Texas American and National
Bancshares deals, each of the state's eight largest holding
companies have found new owners in the past three years.
   The transactions raise the number of bank closings in Texas this
year to 107 and 143 nationwide.
   Texas American's 24 banks were open today as branches of Texas
American Bridge Bank, regulators said.
   Bernard Weinstein, director of North Texas University's Center
For Economic Development, said the award of Texas American's banks
to Deposit Guaranty demonstrates confidence in Steinhart.
   ``He was able to survive the debacle at Interfirst, put together
the investors and start up the Deposit Guaranty group. They've
grown slowly, until today,'' Weinstein said. Steinhart was a
president of InterFirst Corp. before it merged with RepublicBank.
   Before the Texas American transaction, Deposit Guaranty had
purchased 14 banks, 11 of them in closed-bank, federally assisted
deals with protection from regulators on losses.
   Deposit Guaranty's largest acquisition had been the $186 million
Bank of Dallas in February 1988, financed with $70 million in
investor capital raised by Steinhart, the Dallas Times Herald
reported.
   Texas American and National Bancshares were targets of an
acquisition attempt by Minnesota businessman Carl Pohlad last year.
Pohlad's Minneapolis-based firms negotiated to acquire the two bank
companies with federal assistance of $475 million.
   When the Pohlad deal fell through, the FDIC restarted the bid
process. Pohlad teamed with Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis to bid
again. Another Texas American suitor, Security Pacific Corp. in Los
Angeles, also bid for National Bancshares.

<HEAD>Delta Says It Will Appeal Ruling to Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines said Friday it will appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court a federal appeals court ruling which held that
the Association of Flight Attendants may pursue a merger-related
claim for damages against Delta.
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the airline's attorneys were
preparing an appeal of the 3-0 ruling this week by the U.S. Court
of Appeals, which held that the union can seek to compel
arbitration over Western Airlines' failure in 1987 to bind Delta to
a collective bargaining agreement between the union and Western.
   Western was merged into Atlanta-based Delta two years ago. The
ruling was seen as favoring unions that have been hurt by airline
mergers.
   Berry said the matter also had been addressed in two California
decisions in favor of two former Western flight attendants unions.
The Supreme Court overturned both rulings and sent them back to the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, he said.
   ``Delta is going to go ahead and appeal this to the Supreme
Court,'' Berry said. ``We really thought the (appeals) courts,
knowing what the Supreme Court had done, would have the same
finding.''
   Before the merger between the two airlines, AFA negotiated major
wage and work rule concessions covering Western's flight attendants.
   In exchange, the union won a clause in the collective bargaining
agreement requiring Western to bind any successor or merger partner
to the agreement.
   Western refused to arbitrate the union's subsequent grievance
over the alleged breach of contract for failing to bind Delta.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Slip On Weather, Turkish Wheat Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting improved growing conditions for corn and soybeans, and
disappointment over a Turkish wheat deal.
   Rain was falling this morning for the fourth straight day in
parts of the Midwestern Corn Belt. Analysts said the large amounts
of precipitation that have fallen this week in Iowa and Illinois
were timely and badly needed.
   Conditions are expected to turn drier and warmer next week but
temperatures are not expected to reach into the 90s, so ``that
shouldn't inhibit the silking process that is going on right now,''
said Susan Leighty, a grain-market analyst in New York with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Wheat futures prices slipped amid disappointment that Turkey
bought 450,000 metric tons of wheat from sources outside the United
States. The market had rallied Thursday on expectations for a
U.S.-Turkey wheat deal.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with
September at $3.98 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent lower with
September at $2.39 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1} cents lower
with September at $1.50 a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 4}
cents lower with August at $6.79 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .02 cent lower to .22 cent higher with August
at 72.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .20 cent
lower with August at 83.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent
to .32 cent lower with August at 45.85 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .45 cent lower to .40 cent higher with July at 30.10

   Cattle futures settled mixed on Thursday while pork futures were
mostly higher.

<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. today said its
board approved the framework of a new plan of reorganization for
the company and its subsidiaries, including Sunbeam Corp. and
Chemetron Corp.
   But the Pittsburgh-based consumer products company said it may
lack enough support among creditors to win confirmation of the plan
in federal bankruptcy court, where Allegheny International has been
trying to reorganize its businesses since February 1988.
   The latest proposal calls for full cash payment on the claims
against Sunbeam and for the payment of $400 million to Allegheny
International's secured bank creditors group.
   A $50 million note would be issued against claims by Sunbeam's
institutional lenders and the parent's senior secured bank lenders.
The note, to be paid on claims filed since the bankruptcy filing,
could be surrendered after one year to acquire two-thirds of the
common stock in the reorganized Allegheny International.
   Unsecured lenders would get bonds and preferred stock, and
shareholders would be left with 5 percent of the equity in the
reorganized company.
   Allegheny International filed a separate plan of reorganization
for Sunbeam on May 31. That would be superceded by the new plan, if
the board's framework is developed into a definitive plan.
   The company said it anticipates filing the new plan in court
some time in August.
   Chemetron is the non-operating remnants of a former chemical and
industrial gas business.

   Stock prices drifted in a narrow range today in
the aftermath of Thursday's late selloff.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which tumbled from a
gain of about 30 points to an 8.92 loss late Thursday, rose 5.50 to
2,580.99 by noontime today on Wall Street.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 522 up, 718
down and 566 unchanged.
   In early trading on Thursday the market climbed to new highs for
the strong rally that dates back to mid-November of last year.
   But those gains failed to stand up to the pressure of afternoon
selling attributed partly to computer-program activity by
professionals closing out positions in options and stock-index

   Analysts said that reversal served to dampen some of the

<HEAD>Computer Error A Blessing For Lucky Flyers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines officials are unsure
how an old discount fare was reloaded into a computer reservation
system, allowing travelers to book round-trip flights to anywhere
in the country for $152.
   Travel agents with access to American's Sabre reservations
system discovered the snafu early Thursday, and booked an untold
number of delighted clients, the airline said.
   The vaunted Sabre, which feeds flight, reservation and ticketing
information to 14,000 travel agencies worldwide, has been at the
center of two other scheduling fiascos.
   In 1988, American said it lost an estimated $50 million in
potential sales when a faulty Sabre program prematurely cut off
sales of discount tickets, and in May the system crashed for about
12 hours, leaving travel agencies with blank screens.
   American spokesman John Hotard said the airline was
investigating how a promotional fare offered for several days after
the Fourth of July holiday made an unscheduled reappearance,
complete with a new expiration date of Sept. 30.
   ``Somebody just loaded it in by mistake,'' Hotard told The
Dallas Morning News. ``Once we found out, we started pulling it out
of most of the markets.''
   American hadn't determined the financial impact of the mistake
or the number of lucky flyers who booked a flight under the bogus
fare before the error was corrected by mid-afternoon, Hotard said.
   But American will honor all tickets issued under the $152 fare,
he said.
   About the only restriction for the fare was that it required a
Saturday night stayover. But not even an advance purchase was
required.
   ``We ticketed as many as we could,'' said Michele McKechnie,
co-owner of Elite Travel Inc. in Arlington. ``We booked 25 to 30
people _ whoever was lucky enough to call while it was in there.
They're getting a cheap vacation.''

   Strikebound Eastern Airlines has received a cash
infusion of $75 million to help it with its rebuilding plan in
coming months.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland on Thursday approved the
release of the cash from an escrow fund to Eastern. The airline
initially asked Lifland for the release of $100 million from its
major creditors, while a committee representing the creditors asked
that only $40 million to be released.
   However, the parties agreed to the $75 million figure and the
judge approved it, with the understanding Eastern could request
additional money from the escrow fund, which contains money from
the sales of Eastern assets.
   Miami-based Eastern said it expected to file its reorganization
plan today, which will discuss how it plans to emerge from Chapter
11 bankruptcy at about two-thirds its prestrike size.
   Eastern's exclusivity period, during which other parties to the
case cannot file reorganization proposals under bankruptcy law, is
due to end today.
   The airline, which recently slashed fares in an effort to lure
skeptical travelers, now is raising prices on its most heavily
traveled routes. Eastern is hiking fares at least $20 on its
cheapest round-trip fares originating at several cities, including
its Miami and Atlanta hubs, marketing Vice President George Brennan
said Thursday. In some cases, round-trip fares are going up about
$40.
   The move takes pressure off Eastern's competitors to cut their
fares or keep discounts they've recently announced.
   In another development, published reports indicated Eastern was
prepared to sell its Latin American routes and most of the terminal
space they occupy to American Airlines because of continuing
difficulties in contract negotiations with striking pilots.
   A memo from Eastern Senior Vice President Tom Matthews to the
Air Line Pilots Association said the route sale idea would be
scrapped if the company reached a contract agreement with the
pilots, according to reports Thursday in the Fort Lauderdale
Sun-Sentinel and the Miami Herald.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the company would not
comment on the reports. Alton Becker, a spokesman for American,
said the Dallas-based airline unit of AMR Corp. has ``done no deals
with Eastern,'' but added: ``We are an acquirer. If any airline has
assets it wants to sell, we'll look at them.''
   Eastern pilots based in Atlanta passed a resolution late
Wednesday urging the pilots union leadership to continue supporting
a buyout bid for Eastern by Chicago businessman Joseph Ritchie. If
the bid fails, the Atlanta pilots said, the union should pursue
another bid and if that is unsuccessful, it should push for the
appointment of a special trustee to run the airline.
   If that fails, the last resort, according to the resolution,
would be to support the liquidation of Eastern's assets. The pilots
at the Atlanta hub carry considerable weight within the pilots
union's Eastern unit.
   In Washington, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., became the latest lawmaker
to express concern about the Eastern situation. In a letter sent
Wednesday to President Bush, he asked him to direct Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to
undertake ``an immediate review'' of Eastern.
   Eastern parent Texas Air Corp. announced separately Wednesday
that it placed orders for $2.8 billion worth of Boeing 737-300
aircraft to be divided between Eastern and Continental Airlines,
another Texas Air subsidiary. The order includes 50 firm orders and
options to buy 50 more of the jets.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil
Bakes said Wednesday in Atlanta that the transactions demonstrate
confidence that Eastern will be a thriving operation in the 1990s.
The airline is in the midst of a 4-month-old strike by Machinists,
pilots and flight attendants.
   Lorenzo and Bakes also acknowledged that the August expansion of
Eastern's flight schedule will not be as large as originally
announced. But they maintained that the smaller expansion is not a
sign that the rebuilding program is faltering.
   The airline originally promised to have 390 flights a day by
Aug. 1, but it said this week some reductions may be necessary.
Before the strike March 4, Eastern had about 1,100 daily flights.
It now has 220.

<HEAD>California Company Offers New Phone for Hearing Impaired</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California company has developed a telephone
for the hearing impaired that for the first time focuses on the
most common type of sound that some people cannot hear instead of
simply turning up the volume, an executive said Friday.
   The Walker Clarity telephone, working much like a graphic
equalizer on stereo recording equipment, boosts the high-frequency
sounds that most hearing-impaired people have difficulty hearing.
   ``There are over 20 million people (in the United States) who
have some form of hearing impairment, and roughly 95 percent have
loss in the high frequencies,'' Walker Equipment Corp. President
Marv Tseu said.
   For the hearing impaired, normal telephone conversations can
resemble the sounds made when a stereo's bass control is turned up
too much, while the treble is lowered.
   This affects recognition of consonants, and makes it difficult
for the hearing impaired to distinguish between words such as
``tomato'' or ``potato.'' Phone conversations sound muddled.
   ``When you lose the ability to hear these high-frequency sounds
you lose a lot of ability to understand the language,'' Tseu said
by telephone from his office in Santa Cruz, Calif.
   This problem is compounded by low-frequency noise on the phone
system itself. Merely turning up the volume in many cases just
increases the noise without making the high-frequency sounds more
distinct.
   ``If you take a standard telephone and amplify it, it raises all
of the sounds equally. All you get is a louder muddle,'' Tseu said.
   The new telephone has a sliding control that allows the user to
balance the volume and the treble _ the high-frequency sounds _ for
maximum clarity.
   The Walker Clarity telephone will assist anyone with mild to
severe hearing loss, but not those with profound hearing loss, Tseu
said. It works best when used without a hearing aid or with a
hearing aid that has a telephone coil for use on hearing
aid-compatible phones, he added.
   The phone also has a low-frequency, warbling-type ring; a bar
that lights up when the phone rings; enlarged keypad; and a braille
dot on the number 5 key to aid the visually impaired.
   It also features a mute button that will turn off the mouthpiece
as long as the button is depressed. This shuts off background noise
that sometimes feeds back through the earpiece, Tseu said.
   The company began shipping the phone last month to hearing aid
dispensers and audiologists, Tseu said. The phones are made in Hong
Kong and retail for $287.
   Walker is a division of Plantronics Inc., a major manufacturer
of of telephone headsets.

<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC has begun in earnest its
lobbying effort to get the British government to block Sir James
Goldsmith's hostile $21 billion takeover bid. Analysts were divided
Friday about its chances of success.
   Meanwhile, Baring Brothers and Co. Ltd., a privately owned
merchant bank, was exploring independently interest among financial
institutions in launching an alternative bid, sources familiar with
the talks said Friday.
   The Goldsmith group, through a new company called Hoylake
Investments PLC, is offering $13.86 a share worth of securities,
mostly high-yielding junk bonds, for BAT. Launched July 11, the bid
is 80 percent debt-financed.
   The Goldsmith group says it wants to break up BAT by selling off
its non-tobacco interests.
   BAT confirmed Friday that 170 members of Parliament have signed
a motion calling for the bid to be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission for an investigation on the ground that the
offer's highly leveraged nature is against the public interest.
   The members of Parliament are seeking a preliminary debate on a
motion condemning the use of highly leveraged junk bond financing
``to take over major British companies for the express purpose of
breaking them up,'' BAT said.
   Such financing ``poses a direct threat to British industry,''
the motion said.
   It wasn't known whether House of Commons leaders would approve a
debate before Parliament adjourns on July 28 for its summer recess,
which extends until Oct. 17.
   A bid can be held up for months if it is referred to the
monopolies commission. Under the usual procedure, the Office of
Fair Trading recommends to the trade secretary whether a matter
should be referred to the commission.
   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy has said the company also intends to
make a direct submission to the Office of Fair Trading seeking a
referral.
   ``I think there is more than even chance that the bid will be
referred,'' said Bruce Davidson, an analyst with the London
investment firm Smith New Court PLC. ``The political implications
are enormous. Should things go wrong, the politicians need the
assurance that at least they would be able to say they had looked
at it.''
   Nigel Utley, an analyst with Laing and Cruickshank, said that,
despite the considerable support BAT has been able to attract in
the House of Commons, ``I would have thought still that the
government would not refer it.''
   Utley also noted, ``A reference doesn't guarantee that the
(government's final) decision would be negative. In the end, it
would just give them (BAT) more time to plan a defense.''
   The government has blocked bids in the past, mostly on
competition grounds but also for public interest reasons.
   Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson, who has no say in the matter
but who, as a Cabinet member, may reflect the government's views in
this case, said, ``I have to say I rather regretted the arrival of
the junk bond. I don't think it's man's greatest invention.
   But the minister added at a luncheon of The Association of
American Correspondents in London, ``It's a free country. It's not
the government's business. Its BAT's and BAT's shareholders' and
they have to make up their minds.''
   U.S. insurance regulators also are looking at the bid because
BAT owns Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles.
   A source close to Barings said the merchant bank was prepared to
act as a ``focal point'' for shareholders who want to ``maximize
their investment.'' Barings declined to comment.
   A spokesman for BAT, who spoke on condition he was not
identified, said the conglomerate had not been approached by
Barings, but added BAT ``is always happy to talk to shareholders
and Barings is one.''
   Barings has been exploring the possibility, among others, of
restructuring the conglomerate into a single holding company with
four classes of shares to represent its four principal businesses
of tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services, sources said.
   Utley, one of the analysts, said: ``I think it's a natural
response from the investment banking community who will be looking
for ways to help BAT realize value for their shareholders. I'm sure
this is just one of several possibilities they are looking at.''

<HEAD>Lawyer Proposes Limited Supreme Court Appeal in Dalkon Shield Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer who challenged the reorganization
plan of the A.H. Robins Co. said Friday his clients would accept
without further appeal the plan's $2.5 billion compensation package
for Dalkon Shield claimants if Robins would fund the package
pending a limited appeal on a separate issue.
   However, lawyers for Robins have rejected the proposal by Alan
B. Morrison of the Washington-based Public Citizen Litigation
Group. ``We don't believe his proposal affords the basis for
negotiations or discussion,'' said Roscoe Puckett, a Robins'
spokesman.
   Robins, which filed for protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of the federal bankruptcy law in August 1985 as claims mounted
against the birth control device, would be acquired by the New
York-based American Home Products Corp. under a reorganization
approved in federal court last summer and upheld by the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals on June 16.
   Morrison, who has until Sept. 14 to ask the U.S. Supreme Court
to review the case, wrote a letter June 28 to Robins' attorneys
saying that a tentative decision had been reached to seek such a
review.
   However, Morrison wrote, the petition to the high court would be
limited to the reorganization plan's injunction that bars Dalkon
Shield injury lawsuits against Robins' officers and other third
parties if Robins and AHP would complete the merger pending that
appeal and fund the $2.5 billion trust.
   The trust is to pay the claims of some 195,000 women who said
they were injured by the intrauterine device, which Robins sold in
the early 1970s.
   Robins has insisted on a final court resolution of the entire
reorganization before funding the trust, and Robins' attorneys, in
a letter dated July 13, rejected Morrison's offer to separate the
injunction issue.
   ``We firmly believe that further appeals of the plan,
particularly after five judges have considered it and have judged
it proper, are not in, and indeed are contrary to, the best
interests of the Dalkon Shield claimants and other constituencies
of Robins,'' said the reply, signed by attorneys James C. Roberts
and Alesia Ranney-Marinelli of the Mays &amp; Valentine law firm of
Richmond.
   Morrison said his clients want to pursue allegations that
certain officers of Robins and others, including attorneys who
represented the company in earlier Dalkon Shield litigation,
conspired to cover up evidence about knowledge of flaws in the IUD.
   Women who used the device have raised injury claims ranging from
pelvic infections to sterility to fetal deformities.
   In a follow-up letter Thursday to Robins' lawyers, Morrison said
Robins' shareholders, in addition to Dalkon Shield claimants, would
benefit from a separation of the merger-trust fund issues and the
injunction issue because the stockholders would be paid for their
Robins' shares without further delay.
   The merger with AHP involves a $700 million exchange of stock.
   The company's chairman, E.C. Robins Sr., and its president, E.
Claiborne Robins Jr., ``are the principal beneficiaries of the
injunctions included in the plan,'' Morrison wrote.
   Morrison, whose initial offer was made only to Robins, sent
copies of his second letter and the prior correspondence to
attorneys for Dalkon Shield claimants and Robins' stockholders in
what he acknowledged was an effort to put pressure on Robins to
reconsider the separation issue.
   Neither Mark Ellenberg, a lawyer for the claimants, nor Robert
Miller, the stockholders' attorney, could be reached immediately.
   Morrison said in his second letter that no final decision has
been reached on whether to go to the Supreme Court.
   During the appeal of the case, only $100 million of the $2.5
billion trust package has been available to pay Dalkon Shield
claims.
   More than 95 percent of claimants who participated in balloting
on whether to approve the reorganization plan voted for it.
   Morrison argued in the appeal before the 4th Circuit that the
votes should have been weighted so that women with larger claims
would have a greater voice in deciding the issue.

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed modestly lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting improved growing
conditions in the Midwest, while corn and wheat futures finished
narrowly mixed in quiet trading.
   Analysts said four days of showers in the western Corn Belt had
revived corn and soybean crops, and forecasts for the coming week
predicted no return to the withering heat of late June and early
July.
   News that federal regulators had ordered Italian grain merchant
Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. to reduce its holdings in the
now-expired July futures contract last week also weighed on the
soybean market, analysts said.
   The news prompted worries that Ferruzzi might be ordered to
reduce its position in the August contract.
   But Ted Mao, a grain specialist in New York with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said the Ferruzzi news was a minor factor in Friday's
market.
   ``The market in general has been responding to better weather,''
he said.
   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents lower to { cent higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.95{ a bushel; corn was }

   Lloyd's of London insurance broker Dewey Warren
Holdings PLC said Friday it sold the bulk of its 6 percent stake in
the British merchant bank Morgan Grenfell Group PLC for $36 million
after expenses.
   Shares in Morgan Grenfell, which long has been the target of
takeover speculation, jumped 21 pence, or 34 cents, a share to
finish at 313 pence, or $5.10, on London's Stock Exchange.
   The sale was announced a few minutes before the close of
official trading.
   Dewey Warren didn't reveal to whom it sold the shares.
   Morgan Grenfell Chief Executive John Craven said he believed the
shares were placed with institutional clients of Phillips and Drew,
Dewey Warren's stockbrokers.
   Morgan Grenfell has attracted takeover speculation because of
the substantial minority holdings in the company which could be
used as a platform for a full bid, analysts said. The British
insurance group Willis Faber PLC owns 20.7 percent of the company
and Deutsche Bank holds a 4.9 percent stake.

<HEAD>Prime Announces Scheduled Meetings As MAI Offers Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NATICK, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc. said Friday it will
proceed with a shareholders meeting this month to select directors
despite an eleventh-hour offer from a California company to buy its
mincomputer business.
   ``The meeting's subject will be which slate of directors will
run Prime,'' Prime spokesman Joe Gavaghan said. Shareholders will
choose between Prime's present directors and nominees of MAI Basic
Four, a Tustin, Calif.-based company that has been seeking to take
over Prime.
   The meeting, set for July 26, was rescheduled from an original
date of June 14. Prime pushed the meeting back to give its
shareholders the opportunity to consider a revised buyout offer by
MAI. A Delaware Chancery Court authorized the later date despite
protests from MAI.
   Meanwhile, Prime said Wednesday it had received a proposal from
MAI to purchase the Prime minicomputer business for $450 million in
cash and $150 million in debentures.
   Gavaghan said no date had been set for Prime's board of
directors to consider the latest MAI offer.
   MAI had reduced its initial bid for Prime from $20 per share in
cash to $19.50 per share, with 75 percent cash and 25 percent in
paid with bonds.
   Prime subsequently entered a merger agreement with J.H. Whitney,
a New York investment firm. Whitney has offered $21.50 per share in
cash for 79 percent of the stock. The remaining 21 percent of stock
would be exchanged for bonds with a face value of $22.
   Analysts have valued the Whitney offer at about $1.25 billion.

   Stock prices were widely mixed today in the
aftermath of Thursday's late selloff.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which tumbled from a
gain of about 30 points to an 8.92 loss late Thursday, rebounded
16.88 to 2,592.37 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 653 up, 757
down and 523 unchanged.
   In early trading on Thursday the market climbed to new highs for
the strong rally that dates back to mid-November of last year. But
those gains failed to stand up to the pressure of afternoon selling.
   Analysts said that reversal served to dampen some of the
enthusiasm stirred up by the market's impressive advance of late.
   In addition, interest rates rose slightly in the credit markets
today as bond prices gave back a bit of their recent gains.
   The wide swings in blue chip stocks both Thursday and today were
attributed in large measure to computer-program activity by
professionals closing out positions in options and stock-index
futures due to expire after the close today.
   Bankamerica rose ] to 28~. On Thursday the company reported a
larger increase in second-quarter earnings than analysts had been
expecting.
   USAir Group climbed 1\ to 51 in active trading. An group led by
New York investor Michael Steinhardt said it owns 5.89 percent of
USAir's stock and may consider seeking control of the airline
company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .37 to 186.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .14 at 371.05.

   Winchell's Donut Houses, the nation's
second-largest chain of doughnut shops, agreed to be acquired for
$40 million by Shato Holdings Ltd., a Vancouver-based restaurant
and real estate firm.
   Shato, a privately-held firm, said Thursday it will pay $3.80
for each of Winchell's 8.8 million shares.
   The balance of the cash payment will be used to liquidate
Winchell's publicly traded partnership, settle debts and cover
transaction costs, said Nancy Larson, Winchell's director of tax
and investor services.
   The deal must be approved by a majority of Winchell's
shareholders.
   Shato owns more than 100 restaurants and catering outlets in
British Columbia and a land development company.
   Second only to Dunkin' Donuts among the nation's doughnut
chains, Winchell's has 657 stores in 14 Western states. In the late
1970s, the chain had nearly 1,000 stores.
   Winchell's has struggled since it was spun off by Denny's
restaurants in 1987. The chain lost $12.8 million in 1988 and
posted a loss of $3.4 million on $36.3 million in revenue during
the first quarter of 1989.
   Winchell's had been looking for a buyer since June 8, one day
after TW Services, which owns 42 percent of the doughnut chain,
accepted a $1.65 billion takeover bid by Coniston Partners of New
York.
   TW Services also owns Denny's and El Pollo Loco restaurants.
Coniston has said it will retain both chains.
   Ward Lendenmeyer, an analyst at Sutro &amp; Co., said poor
management, competition from grocery-owned bakeries and sluggish
demand contributed to Winchell's decline.
   In 1971, Winchell's bought out all its franchises to operate
them as company-owned stores.
   ``That was a big mistake,'' Lendenmeyer said. ``There isn't
enough (sales) volume to pay employees very much. People tend to
work harder when they have a stake as a franchisee.''
   Winchell's was founded in 1948 by Verne H. Winchell, who sold
used cars and jukeboxes before opening his first doughnut shop in
Temple City.

<HEAD>Turner Gets Grilling Over Bias at Shareholders Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Turner Broadcasting System Inc. shareholders
meeting was transformed into a debate on fairness in media Friday
as a watchdog group accused Chairman Ted Turner of using his cable
television network as a vehicle for promoting liberal political
causes.
   Reed Irvine, chairman of Washington-based Accuracy in Media,
said conservative organizations have a difficult time getting their
views aired on Turner's TBS SuperStation, though the cable station
provides much free time to liberal groups which he said Turner
supports.
   Specifically, Irvine said TBS has given nine hours of prime time
this year to shows produced or backed by the Better World Society,
a group headed by Turner that tends to support liberal causes.
   Irvine, who owns 200 shares of TBS stock, also criticized Turner
for refusing to air an anti-abortion film following the Thursday
night broadcast of ``Abortion: For Survival,'' a program that
favored the pro-choice position.
   ``If you're going to give free air time, distribute it
equitably,'' Irvine said.
   The exchange between Turner and Irvine took up nearly an hour of
the 90-minute meeting. Turner apologized to shareholders who came
to Atlanta expecting hear about the operation of TBS and instead
got ``nitpicking.''
   Turner acknowledged that his personal feelings play a part in
his decisions on which special programs to broadcast, but he said
he is not bound to show the offerings of any organization. He said
each program is evaluated on its own merits.
   He said conservative opinions are aired frequently on his Cable
News Network, but he did not want to be bound to presenting
opposing viewpoints on his entertainment station.
   ``We have to make these judgments,'' Turner said. ``Someone is
opposed to everything.''
   Irvine questioned the business wisdom of showing the abortion
program _ for which Turner said he did not try to sell advertising
_ three times on TBS.
   Turner contended that TBS will not lose money on the abortion
program because ad space was not normally sold out for those slots
anyway. He said one hour of prime time generally is worth $100,000.
   ``We couldn't do it (no ads) every night,'' he said. ``We could
easily do it once a month without any problem. You know we do
things differently from the other networks and we're growing
rapidly, and they're not.''

<HEAD>Bush Launches Negotiations over Foreign Shipbuilding Subsidies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Friday that it
was launching a round of negotiations with West Germany, Japan,
South Korea and Norway in an effort to halt certain subsidies those
nations provide for their domestic shipbuilding industries.
   The decision was announced by U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills, who said the talks would have a deadline of producing
results over the next eight months.
   Hills acted after the Shipbuilders Council of America, the
lobbying group for the U.S. industry, filed a petition charging
that foreign commercial shipbuilding subsidies offered by the four
countries violated international trade rules against such subsidies.
   The four nations account for nearly 60 percent of all the
commerical ship construction on order around the world. Because of
the subsidies, the American shipbuilding industry is in a ``state
of virtual collapse,'' the Shipbuilders Council had argued in its
petition.
   U.S. shipbuilders had petitioned Hills to begin an investigation
into the subsidies with the threat that if they were not removed
within a year, the four nations could face U.S. trade sanctions.
   Hills, however, rejected the industry's request for the formal
investigation, with its more strict deadlines for sanctions, in
favor of eight months of informal talks held under the auspices of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based
organization which regulates world trade.
   She said if the talks fail to produce results by March 31 of
next year, she would accept the petition from the U.S. shipbuilders
to consider actual trade sanctions.
   ``I will review our progress toward a multilateral agreement by
March 31, 1990. If I believe, in consultation with the industry,
that insufficient progress is being made in our negotiations, I
will invite the shipbuilders to re-submit their petition,'' she
said in announcing her decision.
   When U.S. shipbuilders filed their petititon, they claimed that
shipyards in the four countries were getting large government
subsidies that had enabled them to sell ships at cut-rate prices
while U.S. shipyards had received no new contracts for commercial
vessels since 1985.
   The petition had the support of 96 members of Congress including
representatives from Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Virginia,
Maryland and Maine, which have large shipyards in their districts.

crude oil for September delivery settled 17 cents lower at $19.51
per 42-gallon barrel on the first trading day for that contract.
More distant contract months posted smaller losses.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the September
contract of unleaded gasoline rose 0.42 cent to 54.52 cents a
gallon, reversing several days of declines. Other contract months
also gained ground.
   Among other refined products, No.2 heating oil for September
delivery slipped 0.54 cent to 51.29 cents a gallon, also reversing
an earlier upward trend. Contracts for heating oil delivery in more
distant months posted similar losses.
   According to John Hill, vice president of Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures, the market ``felt a little weak, but the overwhelming
feature was no volume.''
   Rumors and reports of continued labor unrest in the Soviet Union
as well as problems at a Venezuela refinery caught traders'
attention. Hill said while it was unclear how serious the refinery
problem would be, traders were looking for something to react to.

<TEXT>
   U S West on Friday reported lower net income in
the second quarter due to a one-time gain in the year-ago period
but noted that its non-telephone operations continue to grow.
   For the period ended June 30, U S West reported earnings of
$258.6 million, or $1.42 a share, down 23 percent from net income
of $336.3 million, or $1.83 a share a year ago.
   Excluding last year's one-time after-tax gain of $88.7 million
from the sale of its 19 percent interest in U S West NewVector
Group, U S West said net income rose 4.4 percent.
   Total revenue for the quarter totaled $2.4 billion, up 4 percent
from $2.3 billion for the comparable period last year.
   Although a little more than 90 percent of U S West revenues come
from its telephone operations, it also owns companies involved in
real estate, financial services, computer software, cellular
telephones and other businesses.
   ``Our 1989 earnings were right where we expected them to be,''
said U S West Chief Executive Jack McAllister in a statement. ``Our
growth in earnings per share continues to come from our
non-telephone operations, and we don't expect that to change.''
   For the six months, net income totaled $508.2 million, or $2.78
a share on revenues of $4.83 billion, compared with profit of
$576.8 million, or $3.13 a share on revenues of $4.44 billion.

   Caterpillar Inc. on Friday reported
relatively flat second-quarter earnings despite an increase in
sales.
   During the quarter, profits totaled $141 million, or $1.39 a
share, down 3 percent from $145 million, or $1.44 a year earlier.
   Revenue during the period rose 16 percent to $2.98 billion, from
$2.56 billion in the year-ago period.
   ``The numbers speak for themselves,'' said Caterpillar spokesman
Keith Butterfield. ``They are on track with our outlook released in
January. We said we expected sales to improve and we anticipated
flat earnings this year.''
   Caterpillar said domestic sales of its tractors and heavy
machinery totaled $1.42 billion for the quarter, up 6 percent from
1988, while foreign sales jumped 28 percent to $1.56 billion.
   For the first six months, net income totaled $282 million, or
$2.78 a share, up from $263 million, or $2.60 a share in the first
half of 1988. Revenue during the period jumped to $5.61 billion
from $4.90 billion a year earlier.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC
announced Friday they have settled lawsuits filed against each
other over the formation of Information Consulting Group Inc.
   Six former Arthur Andersen employees left the agency to start
their own competing consulting firm with the assistance of
London-based Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, a huge advertising and marketing
services concern.
   In October, Chicago-based Andersen filed a lawsuit in the New
York Supreme Court accusing Saatchi and ICG of raiding Andersen
personnel, interfering with Andersen clients and misappropriating
Andersen's confidential and proprietary technology and trade
secrets.
   Andersen, the nation's largest accounting firm, also accused ICG
and Saatchi of trying to force it to sell at least part of its
consulting business.
   In March, ICG filed a $300 million lawsuit against Andersen,
claiming the accounting and consulting firm has sought to destroy
ICG through intimidation and other actions in violation of
antitrust laws.
   In Friday's announcement, the firms agreed to ``put to rest all
controversy and to avoid additional expenses, inconvenience and
distraction of further time-consuming and protracted litigation.''
   The lawsuits were dismissed without any admission of wrongdoing
by any party. But ICG agreed to refrain until January 1990 from
employing or soliciting for employment any Andersen consulting
personnel.
   Andersen agreed to pay the former Andersen personnel now
affiliated with ICG the money in their individual capital accounts,
together with their share of the income earned prior to their
departures.

   Henley Group Inc. said Friday it has agreed
to purchase the shares of Fisher Scientific Group Inc. it does not
already own for about $144 million.
   Henley, which agreed to pay $22.25 a share, already owns about
81 percent of Fisher stock. Until 1987, Fisher had operated as a
wholly owned Henley subsidiary and will return to that status, said
spokesman Norman Ritter.
   Last month Henley offered $20.50 a share for the Fisher stock,
but several stockholders challenged the price in a lawsuit. The
higher price, reached after negotiations, is subject to court
approval.
   Based in Pittsburgh, Fisher makes and distributes laboratory and
medical products. Henley also is involved in the manufacture of
aircraft equipment, the production of methanol and real estate.
   Henley had said it was interested in the Fisher stock purchase
as a way to facilitate the possible sale of Fisher's
Instrumentation Laboratory in Lexington, Mass., and IMED, in San
Diego.
   But Ritter said Henley ``is going to reconsider all of its
options with respect to all the Fisher businesses.'' He declined to
elaborate.

<HEAD>Sixth Plan To Reorganize Consumer Products Business Unveiled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. on Friday
introduced its sixth proposal to reorganize its consumer products
business, including its crown jewels, Sunbeam Corp. and
non-operating Chemetron Corp.
   The company acknowledged that the framework of a plan adopted by
its board may lack enough support among creditors to win adoption
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, where Allegheny International has been
trying to reorganize since February 1988.
   Management has so far filed five reorganization plans in court,
all of which have failed.
   ``This particular version has the support of somebody other than
the management. It's different in this regard,'' said Robert Sable,
attorney for unsecured creditors. ``This has a little more momentum
than some of the others, but it's not a sure thing by any means.''
   The latest proposal calls for paying $400 million in cash to
settle claims against Sunbeam and the principal on Allegheny
International's secured bank debt.
   A $50 million note would be issued against claims by Sunbeam's
institutional lenders and the parent's senior secured bank lenders.
   The note is to be paid on claims filed since Allegheny
International sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy law. It could be surrendered after one year to
acquire two-thirds of the common stock in the reorganized company.
   Allegheny International said it had a commitment for bank
financing for the plan. Unsecured lenders would get bonds and
preferred stock, and shareholders would be left with 5 percent of
the equity in the reorganized company.
   The company said it anticipates filing the new plan in
bankruptcy court in August.
   Allegheny International's fifth plan, filed in court May 31,
called for a separate reorganization for Sunbeam. The plan did not
receive enough creditor support to win adoption.
   Chemetron is the non-operating remnant of a former chemical and
industrial gas business.
   Allegheny International's management no longer has the exclusive
right to propose reorganization plans. Various creditor groups are
drafting plans, but Sable said none expects to file in court
``within the next couple of weeks.''

   CalFed Inc. announced that John R. Torell III
resigned Friday as head of the nation's fourth-largest thrift
holding company.
   ``In stepping aside during a time of momentum and progress at
CalFed, I am accommodating the desire of the board to make a change
at the helm,'' said Torell, who served as chairman, chief executive
and president.
   ``The company is in good financial condition and has positive
expectations for the future; it is definitely on the right track,''
he added.
   Jerry St. Dennis, 46, was appointed president and chief
executive officer while director Arthur W. Schmutz, 67, was
appointed chairman of the board.
   William L. Callender will continue as president and chief
executive officer of California Federal Bank, CalFed's flagship
subsidiary.
   Torell, 50, came to CalFed in August 1988 after serving as
president of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover
Trust.
   He and St. Dennis implemented a plan to boost earnings from
CalFed's savings and loan, insurance and investment management
operations, said company spokesman James F. Hurley.
   While he did not indicate what his next step would be, Torell
``feels that he'll certainly stay in the banking industry,'' Hurley
said.
   CalFed's first-quarter profits totaled $17.5 million, down from
$35.8 million a year ago. Assets totaled $28.3 billion as of March
31.

<HEAD>Buffett Invest in Gillette</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nebraska investor Warren E. Buffett has come
calling on the takeover battle-weary Gillette Co., playing the role
of squire to the twice-targeted razor company.
   Buffett, nicknamed the ``Oracle of Omaha'' for his canny
investments and forthright business advice, has a reputation for
taking sizable stakes in a limited number of companies and holding
them, sometimes for years. Analysts hailed the move as a chance for
Gillette to recover from its costly battles against two hostile
bids in three years.
   ``It's a masterstroke,'' Harry Wells, who follows Gillette for
the Boston investment firm of Adams Harkness &amp; Hill, said Friday.
``One of the things that this does is totally take Gillette out of
play.''
   ``It obviously can reduce their nervousness a bit,'' said Brenda
Lee Landry of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``Essentially, I think it will give investors some confidence,''
Landry added. ``They've sort of got Buffett's blessing.''
   Gillette announced Thursday that Buffett, chairman of Omaha,
Neb.-based Berkshire Hathaway Inc., had purchased $600 million of
Gillette preferred stock convertible into an 11 percent stake in
the company and had taken a seat on the Gillette board of directors.
   ``His record as an astute long-term investor is widely
recognized, and his investment in Gillette is a highly favorable
development for the company, its stockholders and employees,'' said
Gillette chairman Colman M. Mockler Jr.
   Buffett was traveling Friday and could not immediately be
reached at his office in Omaha.
   On Thursday, he issued a prepared statement saying Gillette is
``synonymous with highly successful, international consumer
marketing and is exactly the sort of business in which we like to
invest for the long term.''
   Despite Buffett's good reputation, analysts said they don't
perceive him as a perennial ``white squire,'' or friendly investor,
riding to the aid of besieged companies.
   ``Well, to be sure, he's not altruistic,'' Wells said. ``He's
making a good investment.''
   Berkshire Hathaway is a $6 billion conglomerate with interests
including an encyclopedia publisher, a candy maker, an Omaha
furniture mart and investments in Coca Cola Co., Capital Cities-ABC
Inc. and Salomon Brothers.
   The 57-year-old investor, known for the pithy annual reports he
writes himself, sent a 21-page letter to shareholders this year
that said Berkshire's management team gained $569 million in net
worth in 1988, contributing to an average net worth gain of 23
percent over the last 24 years.
   His interests include 6.3 percent of Coca-Cola, worth about
$1.15 billion. In September 1987, Salomon disclosed it had sold a
12 percent stake to Buffett, preventing corporate investor Ronald
O. Perelman from acquiring the stock.
   Gillette has successfully fought off two hostile takeover bids
in the last three years, but each time at a substantial cost. The
company undertook a major restructuring after turning down a $4.12
billion Revlon Group Inc. buyout offer in November 1986.
   In August 1988, Gillette repurchased 15.6 million shares to head
off an attempted takeover by Coniston Partners of New York.
Coniston agreed not to pursue Gillette for 10 years.
   Coniston general partner Paul Tierney Jr. had little comment on
the Buffett purchase.
   ``I wish Warren Buffett the very best. We have no longer any
investment in Gillette,'' Tierney said.

   Blue-chip stocks soared Friday to new post-crash
highs while the rest of the market edged upward in a session
dominated by program-trading activity.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 31.87 points to
2,607.36, its highest close since it stood at 2,640.18 on Oct. 5,
1987.
   For the week the average posted a 52.54-point gain.
   Advancing issues just barely outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 723 up, 712
down and 526 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 174.88 million
shares, down from 204.59 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 206.96 million shares.
   The upsurge in blue chips, about half of which came in the final
moments of trading, was attributed in large measure to
computer-program activity by professionals closing out positions in
expiring options and stock-index futures.
   In addition, analysts said it appeared that other traders moved
into the stocks earlier in the session, apparently anticipating
heavy demand at the close for the big-name stocks.
   In Thursday's session, program trading was also cited as a force
contributing to market volatility. Prices staged a strong advance
Thursday morning, but those gains failed to stand up to the
pressure of late selling.
   Analysts said that reversal served to dampen some of the
enthusiasm stirred up by the market's impressive advance of late.
   In addition, interest rates rose slightly in the credit markets
Friday as bond prices gave back a bit of their recent gains.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up 1 at 46};
General Electric, up 1[ at 56~; International Business Machines, up
1] at 114[; General Motors, up 1{ at 44~, and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up \ at 37].
   McDonald's edged up \ to 31{. The company reported
second-quarter earnings of 53 cents a share, up from 47 cents in
the comparable period a year earlier.
   Bankamerica rose \ to 28}. On Thursday the company reported a
larger increase in second-quarter earnings than analysts had been
expecting.
   USAir Group climbed 1[ to 50~ in active trading. An group led by
New York investor Michael Steinhardt said it owns 5.89 percent of
USAir's stock and may consider seeking control of the airline
company.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $15.11 billion, or
0.46 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.04 to 187.15.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.35 to 385.31, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.39 at 335.90.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
.05 to 449.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 371.28, up .09.

<TEXT>
   The dollar wound up the week higher in U.S.
trading Friday after a mixed performance overseas amid differing
opinions about the outlook for U.S. interest rates.
   Gold prices posted modest gains in U.S. trading.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
finished at $372.40 a troy ounce, $1 higher than Thursday's
settlement. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of
$372.25 for an ounce of bullion at 4 p.m. EDT, up from Thursday's
late bid of $370.85.
   Currency dealers said the dollar withstood some early selling in
the aftermath of remarks by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan indicating that the central bank's highest priority now
is to prevent a recession.
   In his midyear report on the economy to Congress, Greenspan
implied that the Fed would push down interest rates if necessary to
prevent what he termed an ``unnecessary and destructive'' recession.
   But Greenspan's comments were open to numerous interpretations,
dealers said. According to one view, the Fed might think it already
has done enough to enliven the economy, which in recent months has
sent out sluggish signals.
   If this is true, the central bank might not want to drive down
interest rates any further until it determines whether the economy
needs extra stimulation. Falling U.S. interest rates tend to reduce
demand for dollars.
   A huge weekly increase in a broad measure of the nation's money
supply raised speculation that Fed actions in recent weeks have
provided significant economic stimulation.
   The Fed reported late Thursday that the money measure known as
M2 jumped $17.5 billion in the week ended July 10. M2 includes all
money readily available for spending, such as cash and travelers
checks, plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual
funds.
   ``Fears that the Fed is going to be easing considerably were
eased by the M2 number,'' said Brady Benson, a currency market
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   In currency trading abroad, the dollar had a mixed showing. Late
in European trading, the dollar recovered ground as traders
adjusted their currency holdings ahead of Sunday's elections for
about half of the seats in Japan's Parliament, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar eased to 142.15 Japanese yen from 142.33
yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, the dollar slipped
further to 141.90 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 141.85
yen, up from 141.40 yen late Thursday.
   The British pound came under selling pressure in anticipation of
changes in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's cabinet. In London,
the pound fell to $1.6185 from $1.6273 late Thursday. In New York
it cost $1.6187 to buy one pound, compared to Thursday's exchange
rate of $1.6230.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates included: 1.9095 West German marks, up from 1.9065;
1.6485 Swiss francs, up from 1.6465; 6.475 French francs, up from
6.4630; 1,378.25 Italian lire, up from 1,376.50; and 1.1879
Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with late rates on
Thursday were: 1.9055 West German marks, up from 1.9010; 1.6455
Swiss francs, up from 1.6405; 6.4460 French francs, unchanged;
2.1350 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1530; 1,371.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,378.50; and, 1.1880 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1872.
   Before moving higher in U.S. trading, gold prices posted mixed
results on foreign precious metals markets.
   Gold bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $371.50 a
troy ounce, down from $372.45 bid late Thursday. The metal rose in
Zurich to a late bid price of $372 from $371.75 bid late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.56 to a closing bid of
$372.67 per troy ounce.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.21 a troy
ounce, down from $5.22 bid late Thursday. On New York's Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery closed at $5.186 a troy ounce,
up from $5.181 on Thursday.

   Cattle feedlot inventories in the nation's 13
leading beef states totaled 8.46 million head as of July 1, down 6
percent from a year ago and 2 percent fewer than two years ago, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Only Colorado and Idaho showed increases from a year ago, while
decreases were reported in Arizona, California, Illinois, Iowa,
Kansas, Nebraska Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Washington.
Minnesota was reported as unchanged.
   Marketings of fed cattle for slaughter during April, May and
June totaled 5.99 million head, up 2 percent from the same period
of 1988 and 7 percent above 1987, the report said.
   Further, the placement of new cattle and calves on feed during
the second quarter of the year totaled 5.18 million head, down 12
percent from last year and also down 12 percent from two years ago.
   That was the smallest second-quarter placement of cattle in
feedlots since 1975, the report said.
   Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 6.04 million head
during July, August and September, down 2 percent from last year's
second quarter and fractionally more than in 1987, the report said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13
states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of July
1, and the second number is the percentage change from a year
earlier.

   The price of USAir Group Inc. stock climbed
Friday in response to a New York investor group's disclosure that
it now owns 5.88 percent of USAir's stock and may consider seeking
control of the airline company.
   USAir, which rose $2.12{ a share on Thursday, jumped another
$1.12{ a share to close at $50.87{ Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   In a statement filed Thursday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in Washington, attorneys for Wall Street investor
Michael Steinhardt said Steinhardt's group may buy more of the
stock.
   Steinhardt ``may also consider seeking to acquire control of the
company in the future, although he has no plans or proposals to do
so at the present,'' they said.
   ``We are still reviewing the (Steinhardt) filing,'' USAir
spokeswoman Susan Young said Friday from the company's headquarters
in Alexandria, Va.
   Steinhardt, 48, recently was ranked as the 15th most successful
investor in Wall Street by Financial World Magazine, which
estimated his earnings at $40 million.
   He manages an estimated $1.3 billion in assets. One of his
companies, Steinhardt Partners, this month offered to buy bankrupt
Allegheny International Inc. for a package it valued at $700
million. Steinhardt tried to buy CNW Corp. for $1.6 billion last
year, but lost out to a higher bid.
   Steinhardt has been an investor in USAir for more than a year.
His holdings have hovered around 5 percent of the company's stock,
occasionally going over that level and then retreating.
   In previous filings, Steinhardt has said he was buying USAir
stock for investment purposes. Thursday's filing was the first
mention of a possible takeover.
   Three years ago, USAir was considered in danger of being taken
over by a larger airline. It responded by buying Pacific Southwest
Airlines and Piedmont Airlines, more than doubling its size.
   USAir last month took action to ward off potential unfriendly
suitors by strengthening its ``poison pill'' takeover defense plan.
   USAir earned $165 million last year on revenue of $5.7 billion.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Prices Fall; Weather Gets Blame</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell modestly Friday on the Chicago Board
of Trade while an executive of the Italian firm Ferruzzi
Finanziaria S.p.A. said the exchange had put the soybean market
``in serious trouble'' by forcing traders to liquidate their
holdings.
   Analysts attributed Friday's price decline more to improved
growing conditions than to the ongoing dispute between Ferruzzi and
the exchange.
   Corn and wheat futures finished mixed in quiet trading.
   On other markets, pork-belly futures prices fell sharply while
livestock futures were mixed, precious metals advanced and crude
oil futures declined.
   Soybeans settled 3{ cents to 7{ cents lower with the contract
for delivery in August at $6.73} a bushel; wheat was 2{ cents lower
to { cent higher with September at $3.95} a bushel; corn was { cent
lower to 1 cent higher with September at $2.39{ a bushel; and oats
were 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower with September at $1.50 a bushel.
   Analysts said four days of showers in the western Corn Belt had
revived corn and soybean crops, and forecasts for the coming week
predicted no return to the withering heat of late June and early
July.
   News that federal regulators had ordered Ferruzzi to reduce its
holdings in the now-expired July futures contract last week also
weighed on the soybean market, prompting worries that Ferruzzi
might be forced to reduce its reputedly sizeable position in the
August contract.
   But Ted Mao, a grain specialist in New York with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said the Ferruzzi news was a minor factor in Friday's
market.
   ``The market in general has been responding to better weather,''
he said.
   In Des Moines, Iowa, Ferruzzi executive David Swanson urged an
audience of more than 1,700 soybean producers and traders to form a
committee to study and improve the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``Today, as we are well aware, the market is in serious
trouble,'' Swanson, president of Ferruzzi's Central Soya Co.
subsidiary, told the annual convention of the American Soybean
Association.
   The Board of Trade issued an emergency order July 11 requiring
traders to reduce their holdings in the July soybean contract to 1
million bushels prior to the contract's expiration. The contract
expired on Thursday.
   The order was widely seen as a move to prevent Ferruzzi from
cornering the soybean market, a charge the company denies.
   Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann told the soybean
growers that the exchange took the action to prevent defaults on
contracts to deliver soybeans. Without the order, the board has
said, obligations to deliver soybeans might have outnumbered the
supply of deliverable soybeans.
   Frozen pork-belly futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, erasing the previous day's gains, and a
government report released after the close of trading left analysts
divided on the market's likely future course.
   The Agriculture Department report showed 128.8 million pounds of
pork bellies in the nation's commercial freezers as of July 1, the
largest July 1 supply since the record-high 133.2 million pounds
reported in 1964.
   The hefty supply of bellies, the part of the pig from which
bacon is made, has pulled prices down to nine-year lows.
   Thomas Moragan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in
Arlington Heights, Ill., said recent indications of increased belly
usage suggest the supplies of bellies might at last be dwindling
and prices could start moving higher.
   But Charles Levitt, Shearson's chief livestock analyst, was
skeptical.
   ``When you're at a nine-year low anything is possible, but the
fact remains that we have the largest supply of pork bellies in
storage in 25 years,'' Levitt said.
   The USDA also issued its monthly and quarterly cattle-on-feed
reports. Both reports showed slightly fewer cattle being fattened
for slaughter than the market had expected, and analysts termed the
reports neutral to slightly bullish for futures prices.
   Live cattle settled .08 cent lower to .25 cent cent higher with
August at 72.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to
.20 cent higher with August at 83.85 cents a pound; hogs were
unchanged to .53 cent lower with August at 45.72 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were .60 cent to 1.45 cents lower with July at
29.95 cents a pound.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled 80 cents higher
across the board with August at $373 a troy ounce; silver was 0.3
cent to 1.5 cents higher with July at $5.186 a troy ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 17 cents lower to 4 cents higher with September
at $19.51 a barrel; heating oil was .23 cent to .54 cent lower with
August at 51.29 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .16 cent
lower to .42 cent higher with August at 54.52 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>With Yuppie Sales Stagnant, Mexican Brewer Looks to Japan, Light-Beer
Crowd</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Corona Extra, that trendy, pricey Mexican
beer you wash down with a lime, has lost some appeal among U.S.
yuppies and forced its brewer to seek other customers, namely
light-beer drinkers and the Japanese.
   In a new advertising campaign, the American promoters of Corona
are peddling a new light brew. They're also stressing Corona's
tropical Mexican roots and the heavier version's popularity with
seasoned California surfers.
   ``The U.S. market is flat because of lifestyle changes,'' said
Michael J. Mazzoni, executive vice president and general manager of
Chicago-based Barton Beers, Ltd., which imports Corona to the
western United States from Cervecerias Modelo, the brewer.
   ``There's a new emphasis on fitness, and sales are flat with the
yuppies,'' whose purchases once enabled Corona to threaten Dutch
brew Heineken as the No. 1 U.S. import, Mazzoni said in an
interview.
   Corona sells for about $5 a six-pack in the U.S. market, more
than double what it costs in Mexico. It seemed to draw
style-conscious affluent young Americans like a magnet with its
clear long-neck bottles and the Mexican custom of downing some
alcoholic beverages with a squeeze of lime.
   The Mexican beer's stagnant sales in the United States partly
reflect a decline in alcoholic beverage drinking by many Americans,
which is affecting rival brews as well.
   At 2.4 billion cases, the U.S. beer market grew negligibly over
1987, while imports rose just 0.4 percent after two years of strong
growth.
   Corona's sales in the U.S. market peaked in 1987 at nearly 25
million cases. Last year sales totaled about 22 million cases,
according to statistics compiled by Impact, a newsletter about the
U.S. beverage industry. Heineken sold more than 34 million cases in
the United States in both 1987 and 1988.
   The Mexican beer's hold on the No. 2 spot is secure, and sales
still far exceed 1984, when the brewer sold about 1.5 million cases
in the United States. But the stalled growth has provoked concern.
   ``We've really been clobbered over the past year,'' Mazzoli
said. ``We need some excitement.''
   Modelo hopes to stir something up by introducing what hardened
beer drinkers may consider a contradiction in terms: Corona Light.
   ``It's the final evolution in light,'' said Thomas A. McNichols,
Barton's marketing director.
   While total U.S. beer consumption hasn't grown, light brews are
becoming more popular. For the first time, three of the five
top-selling brands are lights and the trend has carried over into
imports.
   Modelo shipped its first case of Corona Light northward in April
and began test-marketing in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego,
Phoenix and Chicago. Eventually, a new plant in Guadalajara will
produce up to 400,000 cases of Corona Light a month.
   ``There are people who say Corona's already light. But I can't
tell you how many times I've heard people say _ wrongly _ they're
worried about its calorie content,'' said Mazzoli.
   Corona averages about 148 calories a bottle, the brewer says,
despite rumors it's as high as 400 calories. The light variety's
calorie content is 105.
   Modelo and its U.S. distributors, Barton and Gambrinis Importing
Co., Inc. of San Antonio, plan to duplicate marketing tactics used
to promote Corona Light's heavier cousin: relying at first on
word-of-mouth advertising by introducing the brand in trendy
restaurants and bars.
   The successful and voiceless Corona television ads, filmed in
such tropical resorts as Ixtapa, also will be used to tout Corona
Light, McNichols said.
   The brewer also is trying to counter its slippage in the
American market by reaching out to drinkers in Japan, where Corona
sells for $7.40 a bottle.
   ``We're going after young adults, the opinion leaders and what
we call the `sensitive trend leaders,''' said John R. Hamaguchi,
import marketing director for Hiroya Co., Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan's
oldest liquor merchant.
   ``There's the opinion leader: the one always with the latest
news, fashions and hairstyles and who drink Corona because it's a
new thing,'' Hamaguchi said.
   ``Then there's the sensitive trend leaders. Corona's a very
sophisticated item in Japan, especially in Tokyo night clubs,'' he
said. ``That's where the sensitive trend leaders go.''
   Since it introduced Corona to Japan in July 1987, Hiroya sold
130,000 cases of Corona through 1988, making the beer the No. 5
import and 10th overall. ``We want 1 million cases five years from
now,'' Hamaguchi said.
   Unlike the Western ad pitch, the Japanese ad campaign is full of
words. In fact it features a man singing singing about what he
likes and how Corona fits:
   I like two-branch roads in the middle of the city
   A rhythm that stimulates the right side of my brain
   A melody that has lost the code begins to be heard
   If I take the right road, it'll lead me to the end of the ground
   If I take the left road, it'll lead me to the end of the sea ...
   In my left hand I've got a lime
   In my right hand, I've got a Corona ...
   At this moment, I'm in the bottle of paradise.

<HEAD>Dallas Investment Company Makes Offer for I.C.H.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock in I.C.H. Corp. jumped nearly 60
percent Friday in response to a takeover bid even though directors
of the insurance holding company have not decided if the company is
for sale.
   A group formed by Hicks, Muse &amp; Co., a new Dallas-based
leveraged buyout partnership, late Thursday offered $425 million in
cash for I.C.H.'s common shares and said it would assume $1.69
billion in I.C.H. debt and preferred stock.
   The stock offer is $8.50 a share. I.C.H.'s stock jumped to
$6.12{ Friday on the American Stock Exchange, up sharply from
$3.87{ the previous session but still below the offering price.
That indicated investors were skeptical the deal would go through.
   Robert T. Shaw, chairman and chief executive of I.C.H., said in
a news release Friday that the company's board had not yet
determined if I.C.H. is for sale to ``any purchaser on any terms.''
   The offer is subject to a number of conditions, he said,
including the cancellation of all outstanding shares of I.C.H.'s
class B common stock, or a binding agreement with Consolidated
National Successor Corp. regarding the special voting rights those
shares have.
   Consolidated holds 100 percent of the outstanding shares of
I.C.H. class B stock. Consolidated also was reviewing the
proposition, the news release said.
   I.C.H.'s subsidiaries include Southwestern Life Insurance Co.,
Philadelphia Life Insurance Co. and Great Southern Life Insurance
Co., all of Dallas. I.C.H. also owns Bankers Life and Casualty Co.
in Chicago.
   According to the company's 1988 annual report, it employed 4,000
people. The corporation's products also are represented by about
39,000 independent agents.
   The corporation's earnings have sagged in the past two years.
I.C.H. reported a net loss of $10.7 million on revenue of $568
million for the first quarter of this year. Its second-quarter
figures have not been released yet.
   The company also has met with disappointment in its attempts at
mergers and acquisitions.
   Most recently I.C.H. had been planning to spend about $158
million to gain control of Integrated Resources. But the deal was
called off May 25 by the New York financial services company.
   Even before the collapse of that deal, analysts were saying the
corporation lacked enough capital to have room to maneuver in such
deals.
   Despite the uncertainty that has surrounded I.C.H., Thomas O.
Hicks, chief executive officer and chairman of Hicks, Muse, said
Thursday in a release:
   ``We are attracted to the niche characteristics and strong
market position of its core operating companies. It would be our
intention to follow our practice in previous acquisitions of
inviting key management to invest with us in the transaction.''
   Hicks, Muse was formed in May by Hicks and John R. Muse, a
former managing director of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Hicks was a former partner in a Dallas investment firm called
Hicks &amp; Haas, which was dissolved in May.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Pull Back; Interest Rates Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hopes for lower interest rates faded Friday in
the credit markets as traders reassessed remarks made a day earlier
by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   The pessimism pushed bond prices down. The Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond was off 9-32 point, or $2.81 per $1,000 in face
amount. The yield, which rises when the price falls, edged up to
8.15 percent from 8.13 percent late Thursday.
   Greenspan said Thursday in a midyear report to Congress the Fed
had shifted its top priority to avoiding a deep recession from
fighting inflation. Bond prices rallied after the remarks but then
receded late Thursday and on into Friday.
   ``By the time we heard the entire testimony it became clear that
the Fed doesn't have all the evidence it wants'' to cut interest
rates right away, said Fred N. Peck, president and chief economist
of Hillcrest Economics Group in New City, N.Y.
   Cutting rates would stimulate economic growth, but it could also
lead to a resurgence of inflation.
   A huge weekly increase in a broad measure of the nation's money
supply, announced late Thursday, indicated there may already be
plenty of money in the banking system to fuel economic growth.
   ``If they ease at all they're going to need a lot of evidence
that the economy is slowing,'' Peck said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term governments were down 1-32 point to 3-32 point,
intermediate maturities dropped 1-16 point to [ point and long-term
issues declined 5-32 point to 11-32 point, according to Telerate
Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, declined 1.41 to 1,185.97.
   In corporate trading, industrials also posted declines. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, fell 0.07 to 329.39.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 1-16 point to 94 17-32. The average
yield to maturity was 7.20 percent, about even with late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills increased to 8.37 percent
as the discount rose 6 basis points to 8.10 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 8.21 percent as the discount rose 5 basis
points to 7.79 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8 percent
as the discount rose 2 basis points to 7.47 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 9[ percent, down from 93-16 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Kauffman Says He's Sad Marion Had to Be Sold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY STREFF BUZBEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marion Laboratories Inc. chairman Ewing
Kauffman didn't want to relinquish control of the company he
founded almost 40 years ago, but says he knew he had to.
   The drugmaker's future depended on new products, and heavy
competition was blocking it from finding those on its own.
   ``I personally did not wish to sell. It's my baby,'' Kauffman
said in an interview on Friday.
   But he said his concern for stockholders and employees won out.
He encouraged Marion officials to look for a partner and supported
their choice of a Dow Chemical Co. subsidiary, Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals.
   Under a deal announced Monday, the merger will create the third
largest pharmaceutical company in the nation. Kauffman will sell a
big chunk of his 23 percent stake in Marion and accept a switch to
chairman emeritus. He says he'll leave in one year.
   ``It is emotional,'' Kauffman said. ``I originally did
everything in this company.''
   But Kauffman's reduced role at Marion won't be the end of the
hard work he loves. In the wings wait expanded roles with the
Kansas City Royals baseball team he co-owns and more charity work.
   At 72, Kauffman remains as plainspoken and practical as he was
in 1950, when he took $5,000 in card-playing earnings from the Navy
and started a business selling pills to physicians and hospitals
from the basement of his Kansas City home.
   A picture of that house hangs inside the front door of the
company's current headquarters, dubbed the ``Taj Mahal'' by
Kauffman.
   Kauffman worked 16 hours a day as Marion grew quickly, going
public in 1965. ``That was all fun, that was a lot of fun,'' he
said.
   After a dry spell in the 1970s, Marion's sales exploded in the
late 1970s on the strength of the heart drug Cardizem.
   Unlike many pharmaceutical companies, Marion doesn't do its own
basic chemical research. Instead, it licenses compounds from other
companies, develops them for medical use and sells them.
   Company officials project $1 billion in sales this year, but
analysts said those sales would dip in 1992, when other companies
can begin making generic versions of Cardizem.
   More importantly, Marion didn't have another big moneymaking
drug under development. Merrell Dow, with a strong research budget,
seemed the perfect fit.
   ``The merger guarantees growth through the 90s and past the year
2000,'' he said. ``It will make us not only stronger, but better.''
   It also will put a lot of money into the pockets of Kauffman,
his family and trusts and foundations. Kauffman will sell 39
percent of his stake in Marion under terms of the merger. His stake
is currently valued at about $1.3 billion.
   Much of that money will go into his charitable foundation and
some will be pumped into the Royals, he said. Kauffman plans a
bigger role with the team, especially in player development and
scouting.
   Despite his success, most Kansas Citians don't think of Kauffman
as the founder of a billion-dollar company. He's simply ``Mr. K,''
the man who brought major-league baseball back to the Midwest after
Charles Finley took the Athletics away in 1967.
   But the whole thing was an accident, he said. Civic leaders
recruited him almost against his will and wife Muriel encouraged
him.
   ``She said that I was working too hard and I needed some
diversion,'' Kauffman said.
   In many ways, the team has gone against his businessman
instincts.
   ``I would have made more money if I'd invested it in a savings
and loan at 5 percent,'' he says with a grimace.
   Kauffman sold part interest in the Royals to Memphis businessman
Avron Fogelman in the early 1980s. He discounts recent speculation
about Fogelman's real-estate business and says the team won't be
moved from Kansas City.
   ``It is secure now, and it will be secure in the future,'' he
said.
   Although just a ``casual fan,'' Kauffman said he has enjoyed the
Royals' winning years, including the 1985 World Series championship.
   He's also enjoyed his eighth-graders.
   Since 1988, Kauffman has offered to send nearly 700 of them to
college or vocational school, if they promise to stay in school,
keep up their grades and steer clear of teen parenthood and drugs.
   Kauffman estimates the first group of 225 students from his
inner-city high school alma mater would cost him $13 million. It's
money well-spent, both for the fun he has and the practical
benefits, he said.
   ``It's going to get more difficult as they get older, of course,
but we think we're going to turn a lot of them into tax-paying
citizens instead of welfare recipients.''
   For the future, those activities will keep him busy.
   ``I'm satisfied with all this,'' he said. ``But I'm not
fulfilled. You always have more you want to do.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against Procter &amp; Gamble in Diaper Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled against
Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in a patent dispute with Kimberly-Clark Corp.,
defeating the consumer products giant's bid for control of the $3
billion disposable-diaper market.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had charged that the Dallas-based manufacturer
of ``super-absorbent'' Huggies diapers with copying Procter &amp;
Gamble's design of ``super-absorbent'' Pampers.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, was seeking removal of
Huggies from store shelves and unspecified monetary damages.
   But U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins ruled Thursday that a
Procter &amp; Gamble patent for its super-absorbent diaper is
unenforceable because the company intended to deceive a patent
examiner.
   Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman Carol Boyd said the company planned
to appeal the decision.
   Procter &amp; Gamble is the leader in the disposable diaper
industry, with 47 percent of market. Kimberly-Clark is No. 2, with
about 30 percent of the market.
   At the heart of the lawsuit was a Procter &amp; Gamble patent to
combine wood pulp fluff and super-absorbent material to produce a
thinner diaper.
   After the application was rejected several times, Procter &amp;
Gamble was awarded a patent in 1985 based on new test data that
convinced a patent examiner the development was unique, the ruling
said.
   But Hawkins said Procter &amp; Gamble did not provide the U.S.
Patent Office with results of 1983 tests challenging the 1985 data
and the attorney handling the matter was ``grossly negligent'' for
failing to do so.
   ``The finding of intent to deceive is bolstered by the highly
material nature of the false affidavit,'' the judge said in his
58-page ruling.
   Procter &amp; Gamble attorneys argued during the 17-day, non-jury
trial that the firm lost $300 million a year because of the alleged
patent infringement by Kimberly-Clark. The trial ended May 31.
   Hawkins also ruled that an antitrust complaint filed by
Kimberly-Clark against Procter &amp; Gamble in a separate lawsuit may
proceed. That case is expected to go to trial in Charleston early
next year.
   Procter &amp; Gamble filed the lawsuit in South Carolina because
Kimberly-Clark operates a diaper manufacturing plant in the state.

   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said
Friday that it has extended its $110 a share tender offer for LIN
Broadcasting Corp., and suspended negotiations with LIN about
offering a higher price.
   The announcement sent LIN's stock price lower in active trading.
   LIN lost $2.87{ a share to $109.62{ in national over-the-counter
trading, while McCaw rose 87{ cents a share to $36.62{.
   McCaw's tender offer, which values the New York-based LIN at
about $5.9 billion, had been scheduled to expire at midnight EDT
Friday. It now will expire three weeks later, at midnight EDT Aug.
11, unless extended further.
   To date, approximately 3.1 million LIN shares have been
tendered, McCaw said. Before McCaw launched its takeover effort
last month, it already was LIN's largest shareholder with about 5
million shares, or 9.8 percent of LIN's 53.9 million shares.
   McCaw is the nation's largest cellular telephone company with
franchises serving customers in Seattle, San Francisco, Miami,
Denver, Minneapolis and Portland, Ore.
   LIN has a number of major-market cellular interests, owns seven
television stations and publishes city guides for use in hotel
rooms.
   McCaw launched its bid for LIN at $120 a share in early June,
but LIN rejected that as inadequate. It later lowered its bid to
$110 a share, citing a recent New York court ruling that denied
LIN's claim to certain cellular interests of Metromedia Co. in New
York City and Philadelphia.
   The companies later said they were discussing a proposal in
which each share of LIN stock would be exchanged for cash and stock
having an aggregate value of $127.50 a share.
   McCaw said Friday that ``while it has been engaged in
negotiations with LIN about acquiring the company at a higher
price, the parties have been unable to resolve several significant
issues.''
   Because of that, McCaw said it had suspended the negotiations
pending further study.

<HEAD>Analysts: Last Big Bank Rescues Could Signal Future Economic Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICE GRAVINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescues of the last large problem banks in Texas
could signal new life for the state's limping economy, financial
analysts said Friday after the bailouts of banks based in San
Antonio and Fort Worth.
   Federal regulators pledged $250 million to National Bancshares
Corp. of Texas in San Antonio less than 24 hours after bailing out
Texas American Bancshares Inc. in Fort Worth with $900 million.
   Equimark Corp. of Pittsburgh will take over the San
Antonio-based holding company, which owns 12 banks with assets of
$2.3 billion and deposits of $2.2 billion.
   Late Thursday, the FDIC announced Deposit Guaranty Bank of
Dallas would take over 24 subsidiary banks owned by Texas American.
The subsidiaries will be part of Texas American Bridge Bank, an
FDIC-created entity, until Deposit Guaranty's acquisition is
complete.
   The Texas American transaction involved the closure of 24 banks,
raising the total number of Texas bank closings this year to 95.
Since 1984, 290 Texas banks have failed. Nationwide, 131 banks have
failed this year.
   But Texas American objected to the planned arrangements, saying
it intended to file lawsuits against the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency and the FDIC.
   Frank Anderson, a banking analyst for Stephens Inc. in Little
Rock, Ark., said the deals end the problems for Texas' large banks.
   ``A vital and important step in the recovery of Texas is getting
these banks recapitalized,'' Anderson said. ``There must be a
vehicle for raising capital, for business to expand and new
companies to come in.
   ``We're already seeing visible signs of recovery, especially in
Houston. I'm highly encouraged,'' Anderson said.
   Bob Walters, executive vice president of Sheshunoff Information
Services Inc. in Austin was less optimistic, but he agreed the
signs are positive.
   ``I don't think it necessarily means anything is going to get
back going again. The FDIC and FSLIC (Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp.) still have a bunch of problems out there,''
Walters said.
   And, he said, it will take a change in perception _ that people
start thinking Texas is a good place to do business.
   ``But, is this a step in the right direction? Yes,'' he said.
   With the resolution of the Texas American and National
Bancshares deals, each of Texas' nine largest holding companies
have found new owners in the past three years. Deposit Guaranty was
the only Texas company to become owner of one of the problem banks.
   ``Obviously we're excited,'' Deposit Guaranty Chairman Robert
Steinhart said of the Texas American acquisition. ``We have a
unique opportunity here ... We see an opportunity for a Texas-based
bank and Texas-managed bank.''
   James H. McLaughlin, president of Equibank, which has $3.7
billion in assets, will become National Bancshares' chief executive.
   Equimark is contributing $31 million to the National Bancshares
transaction and, with its wholly-owned subsidiary, EquiManagement
Inc., will own about 44 percent of National Bancshares' stock.
Another $86 million is being raised from other investors through
private placements of preferred and common stock.
   National Bancshares' existing stockholders will retain a 2
percent stake in the rescued bank.
   National Bancshares recorded a net loss for 1988 of $189.1
million compared with a net loss of $64.0 million for 1987 and
$32.1 million for 1986, according to the company's 1988 annual
report.
   Before the Texas American transaction, Deposit Guaranty had
purchased 14 banks, 11 of them in closed-bank, federally assisted
deals with protection from regulators on losses.
   Deposit Guaranty's previous largest acquisition had been the
$186 million Bank of Dallas in February 1988, financed with $70
million in investor capital raised by Steinhart.
   Several of the other large banks have been acquired by
institutions in Illinois, Michigan, California and Minnesota.
   Anderson said he believes out-of-state ownership will strengthen
the Texas banking system and make it more competitive, to the
benefit of consumers.

<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp. said Friday its
second-quarter earnings rose 11 percent to $196 million from $177
million for the same period last year.
   The profit translated to 53 cents a share compared with 47 cents
a share in the 1988 period. Quarterly revenue was $1.5 billion, up
9 percent from $1.4 million in the same quarter last year.
   McDonald's sales during the second quarter jumped 5 percent to
$4.3 billion from $4.1 billion during the comparable 1988 period.
   McDonald's attributed the sales increase to new restaurants and
higher sales at existing restaurants. Several marketing and
promotion programs, including the introduction of the McChicken
sandwich, also contributed.
   ``We believe 1989 will be another good year of growth in sales
and profits,'' McDonald's Chairman Fred L. Turner said. ``Our
management team has not changed its expectations, even though we
had one of our strongest operating years in 1988, which has made
comparison difficult for the first six months of this year.''
   For the first six months of 1989, net income was $337.7 million,
or 90 cents a share, up 11 percent from $303 million during the
same 1988 period. Revenue during the period was $2.9 billion, up 10
percent from last year's $2.6 billion.
   Systemwide sales for the six months totaled $8.2 billion, a 7
percent increase from $7.7 billion reported for the period last
year.

<HEAD>Farmers Hostile to Board of Trade; Ferruzzi Official Says It Was
Victim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hostile soybean farmers confronted
officials of the Chicago Board of Trade on Friday and colleagues
applauded their criticism.
   There was a more reserved reception for an official of the $30
billion Ferruzzi Group of Italy, which at one time this month
controlled 56 percent of the contracts on the exchange for the July
delivery of soybeans and claimed it was victimized when it was
forced to sell out over an eight-day period.
   At the end of the separate sessions before a convention of the
American Soybean Association, farmers said many questions remained
over the recent soybean trading frenzy and price decline on the
exchange. Hard feelings were widespread.
   ``Farmers appear to be getting crushed in a battle of giants,''
bemoaned James Lee Adams of Camilla, Ga., president of the American
Soybean Association. ``ASA wants soybeans to be crushed, not
farmers.''
   Two main antagonists _ Karsten Mahlmann, the chairman of the
Board of Trade, and David Swanson, the president of Ferruzzi's
Central Soya Co. Inc. _ disagreed on the July 11 decision of the
exchange to force Ferruzzi and other major traders to liquidate
contracts for July delivery or sale of millions of bushels of
soybeans.
   That decision touched off wild gyrations in soybean prices. The
July contract, which stood at $7.26 a bushel before the Board of
Trade action, wound up at $6.88{ a bushel when it expired on
Thursday.
   ``You took sides. It was highly unfair to farmers,'' Ray Heck of
the Des Moines suburb of Urbandale told Mahlmann in a
question-and-answer period.
   Mahlmann said the exchange board was worried that there were not
sufficient supplies available to meet large holdings of contracts
for July delivery of soybeans in the final days of trading.
   The result either would be a manipulated upward surge in prices
or defaults on contracts that could threaten the existence of the
exchange.
   ``We do not let one market participant muscle things around,''
he said.
   Mahlmann said there were similar contract worries in May, but
the exchange got by ``on the skin of our teeth.''
   Heck said the Board of Trade waited too long to act.
   ``You knew you had problems in May. You didn't know how to
handle it or have the guts enough to handle it,'' Heck told
Mahlmann. ``You waited to handle it in a poor way too late. I don't
think you're lily white.''
   Mahlmann said the exchange was reluctant to take emergency
action ordering liquidation of contracts because it did not want to
disturb markets. He said the board waited until there were no other
alternatives.
   Heck jumped in with an accusation of insider manipulation,
alleging that the board acted ``as soon as you got your setup
made.'' He was applauded by many members of the audience of more
than 300 people.
   Swanson, in later appearances before the convention and
reporters, flatly denied any wrongdoing by Ferruzzi or any attempt
to corner the market. He called for a study by farmers and traders
to find ways to improve the Board of Trade, which he said has
failed to keep up with the global expansion of commodities trading.
   Earlier, David Kass, the director of market surveillance for the
federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, confirmed his agency
issued an order of its own to liquidate contracts even before the
Chicago Board of Trade acted.
   He said a large trader, who he did not identify, was given a
week to reduce its position below 3 million bushels.
   Swanson confirmed that Ferruzzi had received such an order from
the CFTC.
   He said his company was holding contracts for delivery of 23
million bushels of soybeans in July, a holding it began building up
a year ago because of worries that it might not be able to fill
export orders or supply its own plants as a result of a reduction
of soybean supplies in the 1988 drought.
   He said Ferruzzi initially had a small share of the contract but
that its holdings took a bigger share of the outstanding contracts
near the expiration of the July contract because other traders
already had settled their accounts.
   ``We didn't buy anything'' late in the game. ``The universe was
shrinking around us,'' he told soybean producers.
   He said the CFTC's private approach would have given Ferruzzi
time and flexibility to unwind its position, although he said the
contracts may have been liquidated in an orderly manner without
such intervention.
   But he said the public disclosure of the Board of Trade order
and a timetable requiring sales spread out over a specific period
put Ferruzzi ``in a one-sided punitive, inflexible process.''
   Mahlmann said the Board of Trade acted so the process would not
be one-sided. He said its orders also affected traders on the other
side of the fence, who sold a large number of contracts short. In a
short sale, a trader sells borrowed soybeans and hopes the price
will fall before he must buy soybeans to settle his account.
   Mahlmann also categorically denied reports that alleged the
exchange's action came at the urging of domestic trading giants
Cargill Inc. or Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.
   ``We won't let any one party influence the marketplace. We won't
be influenced by any one party. It's absolutely untrue, as some
allegations that have been made, that this decision was arrived at
at the urgence and for the benefit of domestic companies against a
foreign company,'' Mahlmann told reporters.
   ``We believe by having taken dramatic effective action we have
discouraged and will not have a recurrence of what we had to do.''
   After the presentations, farmer Mike Willette of Delavan, Minn.,
said he tended to take Ferruzzi's side.
   ``I think farmers got mistreated a little, but after hearing
both sides I'm not 100 percent clear who's right and who's wrong.''
   But he said the episode has further eroded the credibility of
the exchange.
   ``Farmers are tending to distrust the Chicago Board of Trade
more than before,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Up, Share Prices Down</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning Nikkei, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar moved in a narrow range in morning
trading Friday after opening lower, while share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange held back.
   The dollar was changing hands at 141.65 yen late Friday morning.
After opening at 141.60 yen, down 0.63 yen from Thursday's close of
142.23 yen, the currency traded in the range of 141.53 to 141.80
yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
107.70 points Thursday, shed 45.54 points, or 0.13 percent, to
finish the morning session at 33,619.33 points. The market's main
barometer had inched up 16.62 points at the start of trading.
   Currency traders attributed the dollar's lower opening to its
decline in New York, following comments by U.S. Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   In testimony before Congress on Thursday, Greenspan acknowledged
that ``signs of softness'' in the American economy have shown up
and said the Fed must closely monitor the slowing economy.
   ``Everyone is reluctant to take long positions for the dollar,
nearing the weekend and Sunday's parliamentary elections,'' said
Norio Takeda, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   Takeda said investors are concerned over a possible early
election for the nation's powerful House of Representatives if the
governing Liberal Democratic Party suffers a major setback Sunday.
   Numerous newspaper surveys forecast a heavy loss for the LDP,
which may cause the yen to lose value.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index shed its earlier gains on
profit-taking selling, with many investors foreseeing a defeat for
ruling party candidates in the election, Kazuyuki Suzuki of Daiwa
Securities said.
   Factors contribuing to a gloomy outlook for the LDP are the
influence-buying Recruit scandal, an unpopular 3-percent
consumption tax imposed April 1, and allegations that Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno has kept paid mistresses.
